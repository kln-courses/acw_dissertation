<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CHRISTIAN GOD OF PHILOSOPHY JAMES W. KEATING DE PAUL UNIVERSITY CHICAGO, ILL. 606o4 FOR over thirty years, Gilson and others have defended the thesis that "Christian philosophy" is not only a possibility, but also an actuality. This position has had many critics and the debate con- tinues to this day. It appears, however, that Gilson has never been challenged on a subsidiary, but more radical, thesis. It is startling to find that, while the phrase "Christian philosophy" has been debated for decades, Gilson's peculiar and strained usage of the much more common phrase, "the Christian God," has gone unchallenged, apparently even unnoticed. As the term is gen- erally understood, the Christian God is the Triune, the Incarnate God, the Redeemer of mankind as well as the Creator of all things. Gilson, of course, would readily admit all of this. But it is his contention, perhaps a unique one, that we can speak of the Chris- tian God of philosophy as well as of revealed theology. The for- mer, the Christian God of metaphysics, is born of a recognition of the existential import of God's proper name as He revealed it to Moses. Such a position, which has inexplicably avoided the controversy it seemed destined to provoke, should be examined and evaluated. First, by way of exposition, it will be established that Gilson (de- spite an occasional lapse into the traditional usage of the term) does, in fact, espouse a Christian God of philosophy. Then a critique of his position will be undertaken. Basing the argument largely on his own scholarly research, it will be shown that Gil- son's Christian God of philosophy is ignored or rejected by most Christian thinkers. He is not the God of the Christian consensus; perhaps He is the God of Thomistic metaphysics. Yet, Gilson's Christian God is more esoteric. This "unique and true God of Christianity, Who is the God of Saint Thomas Aquinas,"' is a relative stranger even in the midst of Thomistic philosophers. 1Etienne Gilson, Elements of Christian Philosophy (Doubleday, Garden City, 1960), 86.</page><page sequence="2">418 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW "The Christian God" of Etienne Gilson. Gilson's position is masterfully developed in the second chapter of God and Philoso- phy,2 a chapter appropriately entitled "God and Christian Philoso- phy." In the first chapter of the same work, he discusses the impact of Greek philosophy upon natural theology, crediting it with an admirable theological advance over the crude materialism and anthropomorphism of early Greek religion. The theological speculation of Greek philosophy was never able to free itself en- tirely from polytheism. Although their notion of divinity tended toward the intelligible, the immutable, the necessary and the eternal, the Greek philosophers could never quite decide what place to assign to their gods in a philosophically intelligible world.3 Judaic-Christian revelation solved this problem by plac- ing the one, the unique God at the very source of all being. But in addition it proved to be an unexpected source of the most profound and significant metaphysical insights for philosophers and led them to monotheism and the awful realization that ex- istence, the act of "to be," constituted the deepest layer of real- ity and the supreme attribute of divinity. In Deut. 6:4, we have the source of philosophical monotheism,4 and, in God's conversa- tion with Moses in Ex. 3: I3f., we find the prime source, when properly interpreted, of genuine Christian existentialism.5 "The Christian God" is actually Yahweh, the Jewish God, metaphysi- cally understood. Gilson repeatedly returns to this theme. The proper name of "the Christian God" is He Who Is, I Am Who Am. Since Jewish genius lay in religion and not in metaphysics, the Jews failed to find "the Christian God" in the God of Moses.6 Nor were they alone in their failure. Most of the Christian meta- physicians, while fully aware of Exodus and the proper name which God therein assigned Himself, failed to recognize existence as the supreme attribute of divinity. Thomas Aquinas, however, was an exception, and in his work the ultimate metaphysical significance of Exodus was revealed. Thus, his metaphysics was, and still remains, a climax in the his- 2 Yale University Press, New Haven, 1949. a Ibid., 38. 'Ibid., 38f.

"It was impossible to go further, be- cause human reason cannot go further than the highest of all metaphysical principles. One might have expected at least this, that once in possession of so fundamental a truth, men would carefully preserve it. But they did not. Its loss almost imme- diately followed its discovery." 7 Because of his own existential metaphysics, St. Thomas came to see the pure Act of existing as one sees the presence of the cause in any one of its effects. What is the essence of such a God? "The essence of the true Christian God is not to create but to be." s He is "a being whose essence is a pure Act of existing, that is, whose essence is not to be this and that, but 'to be. . .' ." 9 As has been observed, "the Christian God" is no "sometime thing." There is no possibility that it can be written off as a hastily, and perhaps poorly, chosen phrase. In both The Spirit of Medieval Philosophy and God and Philosophy, it is a leitmo- tif running from beginning to end and appearing well over twenty times in each work. It appears frequently in Being and Some Philosophers and The History of Christian Philosophy in the Middle Ages. It makes an occasional appearance in prac- tically every one of his other philosophical works. Some Inconsistencies. There is, however, an occasional refer- ence to "the Christian God" which startles us, if only because it breaks faith with Gilson's peculiar and controversial usage and reverts to the traditional. In at least three significant instances Gilson seems to revert to the traditional position - the Christian God becomes the God of revealed theology, of mystery, and of faith. i) In the first instance we are told that when St. Augustine read the Enneads of Plotinus, he thought that he found there "the Christian God himself, with all of his essential attributes. Who is the One, if not God the Father, the first person of the Christian Trinity? And who is the Nous, or Intellect, if not the second person of the Christian Trinity . . . ?" 10 The fact that Augustine found no such thing is not to the point. What is dis- 7 Ibid., 73. 8 Ibid., 88. 9 Ibid., 72. 10 Ibid., 48.</page><page sequence="4">420 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW turbing is that "the Christian God" has now, without any warn- ing, become the God of divine revelation with "the three essen- tially Christian notions of God the Father, of God the Word, and of the creation."" Such an unfortunate reversion to the traditional meaning of the phrase is most confusing. The Triune and Incarnate God to whom he is now referring is certainly not the same "Christian God" who, Gilson says, so closely resembles the Platonic Idea of the Good; 12 it is not the "Christian God" of Cartesian philosophy.13 2) On another occasion, when Gilson reverts to tradition and acknowledges the limitations of natural theology, he undermines the foundation on which he himself is soon to build. "For philoso- phy knows nothing of the God of Scripture. Philosophy knows that there exists a being that all call God, but no philosophy can suspect the existence of the God of Scripture. . . . Not only do we need the Christian revelation to believe in the God of the Christian religion, but it is senseless to imagine that His existence could be known otherwise than through faith in His own revela- tion." 14 If the God of Scripture to whom he is here referring is the Incarnate, the Triune God, there is no problem; obviously, philosophy knows nothing of such a God. But it is difficult to see how he can so restrict the use of the phrase "the God of Scripture." Surely the God of Exodus, I Am Who Am, He Who Is, is the God of Scripture. Gilson's fundamental thesis is that, although philosophers never viewed God in an existential light prior to their contact with Exodus, the best among them was to extract the deepest meaning in this name, a meaning which may well have escaped Moses and certainly escaped most of the Jews. Apart from faith, and on the strength of straight metaphysical knowledge, Aquinas knew a great deal about the God of Scrip- ture. According to Gilson, he is actually led to "the Christian God." 1 "To posit such a being whose essence is a pure Act of existing, that is, whose essence is not to be this and that, but 'to be,' is also to posit the Christian God as the supreme cause of " Ibid., 49. 12 Ibid., 25. 1 Ibid., 8o. 1 E.

Gilson, himself, would reject this necessary deduction. 3) Unlike the first two examples, in which Gilson was clearly referring to the Christian God of mystery and of faith, the present instance only creates that impression due to the unusually em- phatic terminology employed. Speaking of Duns Scotus, he says: "What is peculiar to his theology is a marked tendency to make the Christian God, taken qua Christian God, unknowable to natu- ral reason unaided by faith." "1 Peculiar to Scotus??? If the Christian God, taken qua Christian God, is the God of the Trin- ity and the Incarnation (as every reader will properly assume it to be), there is nothing peculiar in the position of Scotus: he is simply repeating a scholastic commonplace. It is in denying un- aided reason's ability to reach the absolutely existing and ab- solutely all-powerful God of philosophy that Scotus assumes a position that, if not peculiar to himself, is at least in opposition to the scholastic consensus. Critique of Gilson's Position. Before developing our objections to Gilson's position it may be well to mention, in passing, a diffi- culty of another order. It seems to raise a serious objection to Gilson's position, but an accurate measurement of its value and impact must rest more with scriptural exegesis than with a philo- sophical critique. It is evident, from all that has been said, that Gilson's argument is rooted in God's proper name as He revealed it to Moses. "Hence the universally known name of the Jewish God - Yahweh, for Yahweh means "He Who Is." "s Does it? There seems to be considerable difference of opinion among biblical scholars on this point. Jean Danielou, who for the most part is sympathetically receptive to much of what Gilson says, disagrees on this important point: "God is sovereign subjectivity. This is the meaning of his proper name in the Bible, Yahweh, which must be translated not as 'I Am He Who Is', i.e., being, but as 'I am That I am,' sovereignly independent within being, per- sonal and living being."

If it is to be of value, the term "the Christian God" must be descriptive of some concept of divinity commonly accepted within the Christian com- munity. As it is traditionally applied to the Incarnate and Tri- une God, the gnoseological value of such a phrase is evident, since millions of Christians profess belief in and worship such a God. Such a notion of divinity is distinctive of the Christian com- munity, radically differentiating the object of Christian worship from that of Jews and Mohammedans. Karl Barth argues along similar lines in discussing the nature of Christian ethics. "Ethics is the attempt to give a human answer to the question of the dignity, correctness, and excellence of human activity. Christian ethics is thus primarily the attempt to give this answer as it is made by those who confess themselves to be Christians and who wish with more or less seriousness to be Christians." 20 The basis of our criticism of Gilson's phrase "the Christian God" centers on the fact that this phrase is totally lacking in any such de- scriptive value. Whatever the merits of Thomistic metaphysics, there is no justification for characterizing its distinctive view of God as "the Christian God." If Christian philosophers share some distinctive view of God, then such a commonly accepted notion might aptly be described as "the Christian God" of philos- ophy. But no matter how profound the views of any one philoso- pher or philosophical school, we only contribute to serious con- fusion when, in describing its position, we use descriptive ter- minology which inevitably suggests that such views are common to the Christian community, while, in fact, no such agreement exists. What right does this existential God of Thomistic metaphysics have to the title of "the Christian God"? None whatsoever. Ap- pealing solely to Gilson's own scholarly research, it can easily be established that the most influential of Christians, Luther, Calvin and Barth, St. Peter Damien, St. Bernard and St. Anselm, Erasmus, Pascal and Kierkegaard, Eckhart, Ockham and Nico- las of Cusa, Locke, Leibniz and Kant, all presumably acknowl- edged God's proper name as revealed to Moses and saw God as the one, the unique Being, Creator of the world, first principle o Karl Barth, God Here and Now (Harper and Row, N.Y., 1964), 86.</page><page sequence="7">CHRISTIAN GOD OF PHILOSOPHY 423 and ultimate end of all things. Yet, for the most divergent reasons, none of them would accept "the Christian God" of existential metaphysics. In God and Philosophy, Gilson considers the case of four emi- nent Christians who were also philosophers - Augustine, Des- cartes, Scotus and Malebranche. Despite the great differences which separate them, they are one to this extent that, while recognizing God's proper name, their insight into its significance is obscured by an essentialist metaphysics. "The God of Augus- tine is the true 'Christian God, of whose pure Act of existing nothing better can be said than: He Is. . ." 21 But when Au- gustine attempts to describe existence or creation in metaphysical terms, he exhibits the marked tendency "to reduce the existence of a thing to its essence. ..." 22 Scotus and Malebranche simi- larly miss the real significance of God's existential name and tend to treat Him in essentialist terms. While "the God of Descartes is an unmistakably Christian God . . . ," 23 we are nevertheless warned that ". . . we should not waste our time in weighing the respective merits of the gods of Spinoza, of Leibniz, or of Des- cartes. We now know what these gods are: mere by-products born of the philosophical decomposition of the Christian living God." 24 In Gilson's otherwise brilliant discussion of Descartes' notion of God, the unnecessary confusion and complete inappropriateness of the phrase "the Christian God" becomes manifest. "True enough, the God in whom, as a Christian, Descartes believed, was the self-same God whom, as a philosopher, he knew to be the supreme cause of all things . ..." 25 And precisely what sort of God did Descartes believe in as a Christian? The context makes it clear that it is not the Incarnate, the Triune God to whom Gil- son is referring but the He Who Is of Exodus, "an infinite energy of self-existence which, so to speak, was itself the cause of its own existence." 26 Is this actually the God Descartes believed in as a Christian? Not at all. As a Christian, Descartes was led by an act of faith, and in concert with millions of other fellow Chris- tians, to profess a belief in Jesus Christ, the Savior and Redeemer ' God and Philosophy, 6o. 2 Ibid., 61. 23Ibid., 8o. 24Ibid., I14. 2 Ibid., 85f - 0 Ibid., 85.</page><page sequence="8">424 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW of mankind. There is no evidence that, in virtue of his Christian faith, Descartes or any other man was ever led to the meta- physical notion of God peculiar to existential metaphysics. Gilson shows conclusively that there is no common philosophi- cal appreciation of the existential import of He Who Is, and by so doing, he provides the strongest possible argument for rejecting his far too exclusive notion of "the Christian God." In his later works a new equation begins to appear which, whatever its other deficiences, clarifies and identifies his unique notion of "the Chris- tian God." He begins to speak of "the Pure Act of Being, the I Am of Scripture and the God of Thomism .. .". 27 The "five ways," he tells us, do not lead separately, one to the god of Aris- totle, another to that of Plato or Avicenna; ". . . they all lead immediately to the unique and true God of Christianity, Who is the God of St. Thomas Aquinas." "2 Thomism and "The Christian God." Thomists, to the extent that they are one with the mind of their master, regard "He Who Is" as the name eminently proper to God. But is there among them a widespread recognition of its profound existential signifi- cance? Bear in mind that "the notion of being . . . , under- stood in the fullness of its Thomistic meaning, is one with the notion of God. . .." 29 Gilson's candor on this point is disarm- ing. "Some of us remember reading and teaching the doctrine of St. Thomas for years without realizing the true meaning of its notion of being on which, in philosophy, everything else hangs. How long was I able to circle round this notion without seeing it? Twenty years perhaps." 30 Why the difficulty? If man's reason is essentially conceptual and if the supreme act of "to be" defies conceptual grasp,31 then even the Thomist is working against the grain in the realm of existential metaphysics. At the very best, it would seem that victory can be attained only after intense metaphysical effort. Yet there are experts who contend that hard work is not enough --that the metaphysical kingdom will not yield to violence. After insisting that Thomism is truly an existen- 27 Ibid. 28 Elements of Christian Philosophy, 86. *Ibid., 85. 30 The Philosopher and Theology, 2o6. 31 God and Philosophy, 69f.</page><page sequence="9">CHRISTIAN GOD OF PHILOSOPHY 425 tial philosophy with an existential metaphysics, Maritain stresses its esoteric character by insisting that the metaphysical habitus is an exceedingly rare intellectual endowment; ". . . although it is indispensable to the metaphysician, it is not given to every- body nor to all those who engage in philosophy, nor even to all philosophers who desire to be or are believed to be metaphysi- cians." 32 "It is not enough to teach philosophy, even Thomistic philosophy, in order to possess this intuition. Let us call it a matter of luck, a boon, perhaps, a kind of docility to the light." 33 If the metaphysical habitus is a rare philosophical endowment and if the metaphysical significance of the act of "to be" is ap- preciated only after a deeply engrained essentialist bias, endemic to the human intellect, is finally overcome, what are the conse- quences for the science of metaphysics? In the Introduction to God and Philosophy, Gilson suggests that a very definite rela- tionship obtains between the notion one has of God and the type of demonstration one would employ in the proof of His existence.34 Does the existential notion of God, proper to an existential meta- physics, have an effect upon the "five ways?" With consistency and courage, Gilson finds that it does - adversely; ". . . al- though not one of the five ways seems directly to lead to the God of St. Thomas Aquinas, one feels behind each and every one of them the presence of this notion." 35 The conclusions of the "five ways" only "become fully satisfactory in the light of a certain notion exclusively proper to Thomism; namely, the notion of being which, understood in the fullness of its Thomistic mean- ing, is one with the notion of God." 36 If such a notion is "exclusively proper to Thomism," this fact would go a long way toward explaining the general failure of the "five ways" to convince - their undeniable lack of general effi- cacy. At the same time, it supports the contention that "the Christian God" finds no widespread acceptance within the Chris- tian community, but is rather the God of a metaphysical school 83 Jacques Maritain, A Preface to Metaphysics (Sheed and Ward, N.Y., 1939), 48, cf. also 30.
