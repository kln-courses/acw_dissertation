<plain_text><page sequence="1">Islam: Past Influence and Present Challenge. In Honor of William Montgomery Watt. Edited by ALFORD T. WELCH and PIERRE CACHIA. Pp. xvi + 359. Edinburgh: EDIN- BURGH UNIVERSITY PRESS. 1979. ?15. This volume is a collection of essays dedicated, as the title indicates, to W. Montgomery Watt on the occasion of his seventieth birthday. Although the essays included in this volume are grouped under four rubrics (Islamic Thought, Islam in History and Society, Islam in Literature, Islam and Other Faiths, with a final Envoi), they range both themat- ically and chronologically over much of the field of Islamic studies. The volume opens with a thoughtful and appreciative tribute by Josef van Ess (ix-xiii) to Watt whose scholarly career, spanning nearly five decades, was an unusually pro- ductive one. The tribute is followed by a general introduction to Islam (1-12) in which Alford Welch, one of the editors of the volume, attempts to provide an historical and conceptual framework for the essays. Although Welch's introduction is in many ways a useful one, it contains a number of generaliza- tions which critical investigation of the last several decades has shown to be wrong or at the very least open to serious question. It has become increasingly difficult, for example, to characterize Hanbalism, as Welch does, as literalistic in its interpretation and opposed to the use of reason in doctrinal matters (p. 5). Careful examination of the writings of such influential figures as Ibn 'Aqil and Ibn Taymiya makes it quite clear that reason in fact played an important role in the Hanbalite approach to theological questions. It was precisely in the dialectical method underlying the concept of bild kayfa, so important to Hanbalite thought, that a sustained attempt was made to avoid a literalistic, anthropomorphic interpreta- tion of the Quranic text. Welch's claim (p. 7) that Ibn Taymiya rejected the possibility of mystical union is true only if mystical union is defined philosophically as a union of being (wahdat al-wujdid). We know in fact that Ibn Taymiya was a practicing Sifi firmly committed to the idea of mystical union. For Ibn TaymTya, however, mystical union was conceived as one of intention (wahdat ash-shuhid), not one of being, but that hardly makes him opposed to mystical union. Similarly, serious questions have been raised regarding the claim, re- peated by Welch, that al-GhazzalT is to be credited (single- handedly, apparently) with a synthesis of SunnT Orthodoxy and Sufism as well as the claim that Ash'arism became the triumphant form of Orthodox Islam (p. 5). The work of Laoust, Makdisi and others makes these claims seriously problematic. Regardless of the precise position one takes on these issues, it is clearly no longer possible to ignore the research of the past three or four decades as though nothing had changed since the days of Goldziher. Henri Laoust's article (15-33) on the influence of Ibn Taymiya opens the first section of this volume which is concerned with Islamic Thought. Laoust skillfully identifies the central strands in Ibn Taymlya's thought and shows how they in turn shaped the thought of a long line of Hanbalite writers from the 14th century to the present. Laoust's article is followed by Michael Marmura (35-56) who contributes a difficult but important essay on the concept of universals as it appears in the Isagoge of Ibn STna's Shifa'. In an interesting</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 445 new study on the Ikhwdn as-Safa` (57-69), Geo Widengren attempts to show that the philosophical system of the Ikhwdn represents a blending of Neoplatonic and Aristotelian ele- ments. However, as Widengren goes on to show, both of these elements were in turn modified so as to bring them into line with the Shlcism of the Ikhwdn. In the final essay of this section, Louis Gardet (70-89) focusses on movements of Islamic reform in the modern period. His observations are as always penetrating and provocative. The essays of this section represent important contributions to the study of Islamic thought. The second group of essays, introduced under the heading of Islam in History and Society, opens with C. E. Bosworth's study (93-104) of Maqrfzl's Kitdb an-Nizdc. Bosworth shows that this short but fascinating treatise on the history of early Islam is to be seen as an existentially grounded attempt to interpret that history in theological and moral terms, and to do so in a way that is both faithful to historical fact and theologically consistent. In a remarkable study (105-125) of the impact of Islam on the European laity from the 9th to the 15th centuries, Norman Daniel argues, with a convincing body of supporting evidence, that the Christian laity of the period showed little interest in Islam as a religion, indeed in religious doctrine generally whether Muslim or Christian, and that they were in fact quite open to Arabs, frequently capable of viewing them in a sympathetic fashion. According to Daniel, the European anti-Islamic polemic of the period was largely the work of professional theologians and the official leadership of the Church. In the last article (126-137) of this section, George Makdisi carries his important work on the development of the madrasa and the university a step further. He identifies a series of important parallels between institu- tions of learning in the Muslim West and the early university as it appeared in Christian Spain and Southern Italy, sug- gesting the possibility of significant Muslim influence. Makdisi goes on to observe, however, that the outcome of the historical process on the two sides was very different, leading (on the European side) to the victory of the speculative over the legal, with important consequences for the subsequent development of the university in the West. In the third cluster of essays, grouped under the heading of Islam in Literature, James Bellamy focusses attention on the complex problem of Islam's impact on early Arabic poetry (141-167). In a careful article (168-184) on popular poetry in Muslim Spain, James Monroe surveys the present state of kharja studies and goes on to offer a series of tentative suggestions regarding possible influences on popular forms of Spanish Arabic. Annemarie Schimmel follows with a lengthy study (188-209) of an interesting qasTda in honor of the Prophet by Ghalib, the 19th century Indo-Muslim poet. Pierre Cachia concludes this section with an important and stimulating essay (210-235) on the "assumptions and inspira- tions of Egyptian modernists." Although he deals with some of the same issues taken up by Gardet in his essay, his study is largely confined to Arabic literature. The fourth group of essays, brought together under the rubric of Islam and Other Faiths, exemplifies less thematic unity than the preceding sections. In a brief essay (239-244), Claude Cahen takes up the question of Islam's impact on the Near East in the period after the Arab conquest. Jacques Waardenburg follows with a lengthy survey (245-275) of medieval Muslim views regarding other religious traditions in one of the best studies to have been so far written on this important subject. In a carefully written and eloquent essay, Kenneth Cragg (276-295) explores the prospects for mutual understanding between Muslim and Christian thinkers. Al- though perhaps too optimistic, Cragg deals with issues that are of fundamental importance for our time. In the con- cluding essay (296-31 1) of this section, Noel King contributes a useful study of Islam's meeting with and impact on African traditional religions. In the final section of this volume entitled "Envoi," Fazlur Rahman contributes a thoughtful essay (3 15-330) on the "challenges and opportunities" facing Islam today. While one may not always agree with the views set forth in this essay, it does represent a bold and forthright attempt to deal con- structively with some of the more critical issues facing the Muslim community in our time. Rahman's essay is followed by an exhaustive bibliography (compiled by Michael McDonald, 331-347) of the writings of Watt between 1937 and 1979, and a carefully prepared index (349-359) of the volume. The essays that make up this volume are in general of a high calibre and represent important contributions to the study of Islam. The editors who have carried out their work with great care are to be commended for having produced an integrated volume of essays that ought to serve as a model for future works of this kind.
