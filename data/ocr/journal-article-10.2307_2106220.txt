<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIAL PERCEPTION AND MORAL JUDGMENT * I. Introductory Clarifications 1. The Two Basic Concepts We shall use the term social perception, as we were using it in our previous publications, not without some misgivings. We shall continue, however, to use it because this term has been widely accepted in the contemporary social psychology. Yet social perception is only one among several modes of social consciousness, or social awareness. In order, therefore, to avoid any likely, or even possible confusion., it is neces- sary to clarify this concept quite at the, outset of this study. By "social perception," then, we shall understand on the following pages any kind of consciousness or awareness concerning other persons as well as any social relations among them, provided that either the inner aspects of those persons or relations is the object of our awareness and of our interest; or both the inner and the external aspect, i.e., if and when the "external aspect" is perceived or viewed as appearance, mani- festation, expression, or symbol of the inner personality, and not only as a merely physical fact. Thus, the counter-concept to social perception, defined in such a way, is physical or thing-perception, in which latter case the the inner aspect does either actually not exist, or does exist, but is disregarded because, for one reason or another, we are not interested in it. As already mentioned social perception is only one among several other modes of social consciousness or awareness, which other modes may consist not in perceiving, but in assuming, thinking, imagining, and the like. These different modes are not only phenomenologically different but play also a different dynamic role in the processes of social aware- ness, a fact which has to be taken into account in dealing with these * The present essay is my latest contribution in a long series of publications, both in Europe and in this country, which deal with various forms of social per- ception, particularly false social perception. This fact will, I hope, excuse, or at least explain, why most of my footnotes refer to my own previous publications. The present essay will be included in a new study on which I am working under a grant of the Rockefeller Foundations, and which will deal with certain forms of a false political perception. 546</page><page sequence="2">SOCIAL PEACEPTION AND MORAL JUDGMENT 547 problems. Whenever necessary, we shall indicate whether we are using the concept in terms of of perception proper, i.e., in the narrow meaning of this term, or in the broader meaning including the other modes of social perception. Hence, if no special qualification is inserted, "social perception" will mean any of its various modes (assuming, thinking, etc.). It is worth mentioning that often we do approach physical facts ("things") in terms of social perception, apprehending them as if they were "persons," or at least personalized. We are dealing then either with various forms of animism and anthropomorphism, or with various forms of aesthetic perception. Hence between the analysis and theory of social perception and of aesthetic perception there is a very close relationship, as is particularly clear when we are dealing with the facts of empathy, and many related problems. However, any further clarification of these concepts is not relevant in the context of our present inquiry and can, therefore, be here disregarded. Our second basic concept, namely that of moral judgment, we shall use in this essay also in a very broad sense. Hence by moral judgment we shall not only understand judgment proper, but any kind of reac- tions, attitudes, and sentiments insofar as they contain or imply approval or disapproval of "right" and "wrong," of "good" and "bad," of "virtue" and "vice." And again, we shall not pursue any further clarification of this concept, because what we just stated is sufficient in the context of our present interest. 2. Social Perception as Basis of Moral Judgments The problem of the relation between social perception and moral judgment is, of course, akin to the much debated philosophical problem concerning the relations between "values" and "facts." 1 Now, whatever, in abstract, the relation may be between the realms of values andi the realm of facts, there can be no question that all con- crete moral judgments about concrete persons or person-related (per- sonalized) events are always based on some factual contents presented to us by our social perception. This state of affairs is one of those "obvious" facts, which, as this author has emphasized in his previous contributions again and again are, in spite, and often even because of their very obviousness, either altogether ignored, or misunderstood in their fundamental significance and in their far-reaching implications. 2 1 See Ray Lepley, ed. V: A Cooperative Inquiry. New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1949. 2 See my article "Why Psychologists Tend to Overlook Certain Obvious Facts," Phil. of Science, X, 1943; reprinted in a slightly changed version in my "Mis- understandings in Human Relations: A Study in False Social Perception," The Am. Journal of Sociology, Sept. 1949, Part 2, pp. 1-4.</page><page sequence="3">548 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH The truth in this matter is that the so-called moral judgments are a compound the duality of which is blurred and confused by the fact that very often its moral-evaluative aspect is explicit while the underlying factual assertion or assumption is only implicit, so that we are not aware of their, as it were, hidden presence. It is this often explicit character of moral judgments and only implicit character of the underlying social perception which obscures the otherwise obvious relation between values and facts.3 Let us illustrate and make clear this state of affairs, namely that concrete moral judgments are always based on underlying, often only implicit, contents of social perception. If I judge something (or feel about something, or have an attitude towards something) as being morally "good" and "right," or, on the contrary, as being "bad" and "wrong," such moral judgment (reaction, attitude, sentiment), are always, whether I am explicitly aware of it or not, based on a factual perception, or factual assumption that this "something," i.e., this person or action or person-related event, does possess certain factual attributes or charac- teristics, that, for instance, the given individual had actually certain in- tentions, that the given action was actually sincere, or that, on the con- trary, his behavior was actually hypocritical. And the moral judgment, reaction, or sentiment, is always only superimposed upon that factual assessment. Therefore, if we find out that our respective factual assessment was, for one reason or another, mistaken or false, then it follows inevitably that our superimposed moral judgment was wrong because it was based on an erroneous foundation. Had we known that that intention was not what we assumed it to be, or that the behavior of the given individual was hypocritical, then our resulting moral judgment would have been entirely different. And it would have been different not because we changed or corrected our moral values and standards but because we changed our assessment concerning the underlying facts. Again, an "obvious" state of affairs which, however, is often ignored or misunder- stood in its tremendous implications. 3 I am well aware that sometimes we are confronted by an opposite state of affairs in which the factual statement is explicit while the superimposed evaluation is implicit and veiled. This is the case, for instance, when we are trying to dis- credit our opponents by using, in referring to them, such psychiatric terms as "neurotic," "hysterical," "paranoid," at the same time declaring in a sanctimonious way that in doing so we are by no means evaluating, i.e., condemning anybody but are only simply "stating facts." In reality, we are using this surreptitious technique to hide what we are actually doing behind the cover of an alleged scientific procedure. However, such a reverse relation between "values" and "facts" is not pertinent to the subject here under consideration.</page><page sequence="4">SOCIAL PERCEPTION AND MORAL JUDGMENT 549 It is worth while to mention that jurisprudence and legal procedure does insist upon, and does take into account, that duality we are here referring to, by differentiating clearly between the quaestio facti and the quaestio juris. However, this clear and definite distinction is applied clearly and unambiguously only within the legal sphere. In our everyday proceedings, on the contrary, a kind of a twilight usually prevails: we are only seldom aware that in our "moral judgments" always a duality of factors is involved, one factual, another moral (evaluational). And being blinded to this all-pervading duality, we are also often not aware that our moral judgments might, and actually often are, wrong because the factual basis of our concrete moral reactions is erroneous. It is hardly possible to overrate the importance of this confusion in human affairs. For a great many (although not all!) most virulent, seemingly moral, disagreements among men are actually not moral but factual in their nature - they are rooted in the diversity and in the contradictions of our social perceptions. We disagree with each other and are in conflict with each other often over seemingly moral issues because we perceive the underlying facts in a different way, or even because some of us do, and some of us fail altogether, to perceive the relevant facts. And since, in one way or another, moral elements are mostly involved in social and political ideologies, a great many ideo- logical conflicts, particularly in our confused age, are, indirectly or directly rooted in the, contradictions of our social perception. The full meaning of this state of affairs will become clear as we proceed with our analysis. However, before discussing and exemplifying the role of false social perception upon the falsification of our superimposed moral judgments, we have to introduce at this place still another distinction, namely the distinction between two types of false social perception: the distorted social perception and an outright (partial) social blindness. In our former publications, we did not pay a sufficient attention to the difference between those two types of false perception, and their different effects upon human affairs. 3. The "Distorted" Social Perception and the "Social Blindness" The social perception which is at the bottom of our superimposed moral judgments might, on the one hand, be misleading because it distorts or misinterprets the facts which are its object: the relevant facts them- selves, which are there, are indeed perceived, but are misinterpreted as 'to their proper meaning, i.e., as to their causes and their consequences. In this first case, we are dealing with the distorted social perception. However, the misleading character of social perception often extends</page><page sequence="5">550 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH beyond a mere distortion of, in the given context, the relevant facts, and assumes the proportion of an outright, at least partial, social blindness. In this second case, we not only distort and misinterpret the meaning of the facts but are simply, for one reason or another, not aware of their existence, although they might be of utmost significance in the given context. Our moral reaction, as, we shall see soon, assumes then an entirely paradoxical character: we ourselves are, for instance, often furiously indignant about certain social evils, because, for one reason or another, we are keenly aware of their existence, while other people remain entirely indifferent to those evils not because they are morally insensitive but simply because they are not aware of their presence. At the same time, we, in turn, may remain indifferent to certain similar, or even identical, evils to which other people are sensitized but to which we ourselves are totally blinded. As we shall show further below, we are here confronted with certain most shocking as well as most puzzling moral paradoxes of our age. Between the two extremes, of an only somewhat distorted social per- ception on the one hand, in which case we do perceive the relevant facts yet, misinterpret and misunderstand as, to their proper meaning, and, on the other hand, an outright social blindness, in which case we are, some- times in a very strange way, entirely unaware of their presence, there are of course, many intermediate forms of false social perception which might either approximate more the one, or more the other, form of the two extreme "ideal types." II. The Distorted Social Perception as a Cause of the Falsification of Moral Judgments We shall illustrate in this section, using several characteristic exam- ples, the effect of the distorted social perception upon moral judgments. Our previous contributions to which we refer in our footnotes, deal mainly with the factual aspects of the false social perception, without exploring or discussing the relationship between social perception and the superimposed moral judgment which is the main subject matter of our present essay. First Example: Success.4 If we approve (morally) of Mr. X as a successful self-made man, then, whether or not we are aware of it, the 4 See my monograph Kritik des Erfolges: Eine Soziologische Untersuchung, Leipzig: C. L. Hirschfeld, 1930, and my article "Einige typische Deutungen der Erfolgstatsachen," Koelner Vierteljahshefte fur Soziologie, X, 1931, pp. 51-66; also my article, "Ideology of Success and the Dilemma of Education," Ethics, LII (1943), pp. 139-41, and my "Misunderstandings" (op. cit.), pp. 31-33.</page><page sequence="6">SOCIAL PERCEPTION AND MORAL JUDGMENT 551 basis of our favorable moral reaction is an underlying, even though often only an implicit, factual assumption that success is always the outcome of a given person possessing certain characteristics which we consider as being valuable. What we are, therefore, approving of is not the mere fact of the success itself, but of the success as an alleged in- dicator of certain personal attributes which, again allegedly, are its cause. Now if someone (as this author has done in a number of his writings) were to expose the fundamental fallacy of that assumption concerning the alleged conditions of success, in pointing out the "obvious," i.e., known but nevertheless ignored fact that success depends not only on the possession of personal characteristics of which we generally approve, as for instance, intelligence, cleverness, ability, industriousness, profi- ciency, reliability, and the like, but also, and often even decisively, on certain personal characteristics of which we generally disapprove, such as lack of consideration for other people, disregard of moral restraints, over-assertiveness, over-aggressiveness, opportunism, unscrupulousness, and so forth, then, when confronted by a concrete case, taking these and similar facts and conditions into account, our original moral approval would probably undergo a fundamental transformation into, its. opposite, namely, an outright disapproval of the given individual. What would have changed in such a case, however, is not our moral values and standards which actually remained the same, but the factual basis under- lying our superimposed moral judgment. Which, incidentally, shows that any moral fervor is not only meaningless but often even leads us to morally wrong conclusions and actions if it is not based on a preceding realistic critique of our factual social perception which guides all our moral judgments, actions, and reactions; and that, consequently, the "men of good will," if they are not also' men of intelligent and realistic insight, are often, in spite of their highly moral intentions, doing a great deal of harm, because their actions result in morally wrong consequences which, to be sure, they did not anticipate. Hence Socrates was at least partly right in insisting that "virtue is knowledge." 5 Second Example: Aggression.6 If, again, we diasapprove morally of "aggression" as one of the allegedly supreme evils in interpersonal as 5 It is worth noting that original Christianity, paradoxically, but nevertheless realistically from its own religious point of view, did in fact consider the success "in this world" not as a sign of virtue but, on the contrary, as a sign of "reli- gious" corruption. A thorough discussion of this problem can be found in my article "Einige typische Deutungen der Earfolgstatsachen" mentioned in footnote 4. 6 See my articles "Frustration and Aggression or Frustration and Defense: A Counter-Hypothesis," The Journal of General Psychology, 1950, 43, pp. 125-29, and "On Freud's Blind Spots Concerning Some Obvious Facts," Journal of In- dividual Psychology, Vol. 16/1, May 1960, pp. 45-55.</page><page sequence="7">552 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH well as intergroup relations, then this our unqualified disapproval is based on the uncritically accepted factual assumption (of which we are mostly explicitly not aware) that what to us, from our point of view, looks like "aggression," is always actually aggression from the point of view of those who are allegedly committing it. While in fact, from their point of view, it often not only does not "look like," but actually is not "aggression," but rather what they insist it is, namely, self-defense, or revolt, or even fight for -freedom and justice. Our mistaken, mostly unconscious, very general, and very human assumption is that what "I" or "We," and not what "He" or "They" perceive as the facts of the situation, is actually the relevant reality. Now, if we were able and willing to clarify the factual events and issues underlying, or even preceding, a given interpersonal or intergroup conflict, and if we were able and willing to rectify our erroneous factual assumption, then, inevitably, our superimposed moral judgments, would also undergo a radical change. For even though we feel justified in condemning morally what we considered to be an act of (unprovoked) aggression, we might very well at the same time, in accordance with our moral values and standards, strongly approve of actions which, looking like "aggression," are in fact acts of defense or revolt. What, however, in this case as well as in our first example, would have changed, would not be our moral judgment proper but rather our social perception of facts and issues underlying our moral reaction. And so, suddenly, in a way which might remain incomprehensible to our own friends, our sym- pathy might shift to the side of the alleged "aggressors" who, according to our newly won insight, are actually defending themselves, or are revolting against injustice, exploitation, or oppression. Third Example: A misunderstood ideological disagreement. As already mentioned before, ideological attitudes contain almost always certain specifically moral elements. Our following example, therefore, in dealing with a misunderstood ideological disagreement between two friends, deals at the same time quite definitely with the problem of the relation- ship between social perception and moral judgment which is here under consideration. Let us, then, consider a personal relation between two political friends, whose identical ideological attitude formed the actual basis of their friendship, and who suddenly, to their own very perplexed surprise, find themselves in a complete and violent disagreement concerning Peron, and his movement and regime, in Argentina. While A, who, until now, was always in full political and ideological accord with his friend B. strongly disapproves of Peronism, B equally strongly approves of it. "You were always," says A to B, pro-labor, and now suddenly, in a way</page><page sequence="8">SOCIAL PERCEPTION AND MORAL JUDGMENT 553 which is incomprehensible to me, you seem to have become a pro- Fascist." Now, it is quite possible that a calm discussion with a third, more sophisticated friend would reveal that their sudden "incomprehensible disagreement" is not a moral-ideological one but is of a factual nature; that they disagree with each other simply because they see the under- lying facts differently, facts, on which their respective moral-ideological attitudes and reactions are based. They both are and remain, as they always have been, fundamentally, prolabor, and this pro-labor attitude continues to be ideologically dominant in both of them. But while A attaches to the name of Peron and to the name of Peron's movement the conventional label "Fascism," without being aware that this is actually a very ambiguous term with which people, in a confused manner, tend to designate various political movements and regimes which, in fact, apart from some superficial symbols, have very little in common with each other, i.e., without being aware that there are various very different sometimes revolutionary, and sometimes reactionary types of "Fascism," B, being politically more sophisticated and less misled by empty symbols and slogans, is well aware that just in Argentina, Peron and Peronism are definitely pro-labor, and labor ardently pro-Peron. About these facts themselves there can hardly be any doubt. However, the main point in this context is not which of the two friends is correct in terms of the factual assessment of the controversial state of affairs., i.e., in terms of the factual social perception. The main point rather which we are trying to illuminate by using this example is that the disagreement we are here confronted with is only seemingly political and ideological in its character; in reality it is rooted in a dis- agreement about the underlying facts as they are presented to the two friends by their social perception. In other words, it is rooted in a mis- understanding: the two friends continue to cherish the same identical pro-labor attitudes and sentiments - they disagree only, without being aware of it, as to the facts on which their mutual pro-labor attitudes are based. While A disapproves of Peron and Peronism because he assumes that Peron is anti-labor, B approves of him because he is con- vinced that Peron is actually pro-labor. If the respective misunder- standing could be eliminated A and B would be again in full ideological- moral accord with one another, and thus could restore their friendship. It is clear, therefore, that people might violently disagree with each other and fight each other about seemingly moral or ideological issues although they actually share identical moral or ideological standards and values. They are in conflict with each other simply because they are not aware that what separates them'from each other and lets them turn</page><page sequence="9">554 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH against each other is not any disparity of moral or ideological standards and values but contradictions between the factual contents of their respective social perceptions. Or again, people may morally seemingly "agree" with each other, although their moral standards and values are quite different, because they mistakenly assume that certain social facts on which their moral pseudo-agreement is based are similar or identical, while in reality they are entirely different. They might, for instance, "agree" in rejecting war as an instrument of foreign policy, not being aware that in one case war might serve the purpose of imposing upon other people oppression and exploitation, or even depriving them of independence, while in another case it might, on the; contrary, serve the purpose of liberating people from oppression, exploitation, or even enslavement. In such a case a given moral "agreement" is only illusory because it is based on a mis- understanding of the facts underlying the moral reaction. There is not the slightest doubt in the mind of this author that a great many, although by no means all, seemingly moral and ideological con- flicts of our age are rooted in various misunderstandings and misinter- pretations concerning the nature of the social facts we are confronted with, and not in any differences of moral values and standards. This will become still more clear when in the next section we shall consider certain paradoxes which are the manifestation of the selective nature of our social perception. III. Social Blindness as Source of Moral Paradoxes 1. Selective Nature of Social Perception So far we have been discussing only the effects of one of the two main types of false social perception, namely, the distorted social per- -ception upon moral judgments and moral disagreements. As already said, in case of such a distorted social perception, we perceive the relevant social facts but misinterpret them as to their proper meaning. At present, we shall consider the facts and problems of the second type of false social perception, namely, an outright, even though often only partial, social blindness. The falsifying effects of this second type of false social perception upon moral judgments and moral disagree- ments are still more perplexing and paradoxical than those discussed in the preceding section. The (partial) social blindness is the result of the fact that social per- ception, as any other perception, is selective in its nature, without our being explicitly aware of it. This means that we often do perceive very keenly certain facts in the total field of our potential experience, but at</page><page sequence="10">SOCIAL PERCEPTION AND MORAL JUDGMENT 555 the same time are blinded to other, often quite similar, facts, although these latter might be as relevant in the given context as the former. The world which surrounds us is full of social events, situations, and actions which we quite definitely would consider, denounce, and possibly even fight as an evil, if only we were aware of their existence. As a rule, however, we are aware and are thus morally reacting only to some of them, while remaining at the same time totally unaware, and thus morally indifferent, to similar, or even identical evils which might occur before our very own noses, and this, by the way, makes often of our "selective" moral indignations nothing but a mockery. Without being able to go at this time into any more detailed analysis, we shall enumerate presently quite briefly the main factors which control and direct our selective social perception, and define for us, often behind our own back, what we consider to be the reality.7 Whether we perceive certain social facts, or, on the contrary, are blinded to them, depends on: a) The bio-psychological organization of our sensorium. Of particular importance here is the role of "visibility";8 since our eyes are our domi- nant senses of reality, our attention is not only strongly attracted to what is visible, but we tend also to consider those aspects of our perceptual experience which are visible as being somehow "more real" than those which are not visible. Hence, for instance, we have a tendency to per- ceive and to condemn visible forms of power and coercion, particularly violence, more than invisible forms, such as the power of money or the power of covert manipulation, although it is by no means certain whether the latter is a lesser evil than the former; b) On specifically psychological mechanisms of perception which make us attentive to certain facts, for instance, the new, the unexpected, the dramatic, and unattentive or less attentive to others, for instance, the routine, the obvious., the quiet; See my article "On Freud's Blind Spots," mentioned in the preceding foot- note particularly the section on the psychological problem of Reality. 8 See my "Misunderstandings" (op. cit.), p. 17, and my article "Sociopsycho- logical and Cultural Factors in Race Relations," Am. Journal of Sociology, LIV (March, 1949), pp.. 395-401. However, after rereading William James, The Varieties Religious Experience, New York: The Modern Library, particularly Lecture 3 on "The Reality of the Unseen," I came to the conclusion, that our assertion con- cerning the role of "visibility" requires some qualification. For, as James says (P. 58): "It is as if there were in the human consciousness a sense of reality ... more deep and more general than any of the particular 'senses' by which the cur- rent psychology supposes existent reality to be originally revealed." Still, in terms of our common sense experience, I believe that our statement concerning the para- mount role of visibility in our conceptions about reality remains valid.</page><page sequence="11">556 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH c) On our individual sensitivities (idiosyncrasies), whatever their origin; d) On our cultural background, i.e., on our "'Kulturbrille," which sensitizes us to certain facts or aspects of facts, and blinds us to others; e) On whether the respective social facts, particularly social evils, affect us and those with whom we are identified, or affect only the in- different or even antagonistic "others"; f) On the concrete social situation in which we ourselves are located, which situation defines (to use the language of sociology of knowledge) our social perspective; and last but not least g) On the information and misinformation which is transmitted to us, or withheld from us, by other people, particularly by those who control the media of communications. These, then, are the most important factors which guide and misguide our social perceptions and are responsible for our perceiving certain fragments of our potential experience, and for remaining blinded to others. The, next logical step now would consist in exemplifying concretely some effects of social blindness upon our moral judgments. However, we are confronted here by the following peculiar problem and dilemma: exemplification is, admittedly, itself a function of selective social per- ception. In proceeding, therefore, with our exemplification, without taking into account this problem, we would expose ourselves to a valid criticism that we are not actually exemplifying, but rather revealing, as a kind of a "symptom," the mechanisms which control our own selective social perception. This objection is so serious that we decided to precede our examples, which we shall present in the last section of this essay, by a discussion of this perplexing problem and dilemma. 2. The Dilemma of Exemplifying the Selective Social Perception Here are our main comments concerning this dilemma: a) Let us state, first of all, that we are fully aware of the fact that any exemplification of the selective social perception is bound to operate within the framework of our own selective social perception, and is, therefore, involved in all its dilemmas and paradoxes. This applies, of course, to the examples presented by ourselves as well as to the exam- ples presented by anybody else. b) We are not only fully aware but are even insisting that as far as social facts and issues are concerned, not our generalizations "in pmn- ciple" but our concrete exemplifications "in fact" are the real thing. This means that what an author has in his mind (and in his heart) reveals</page><page sequence="12">SOCIAL PERCEPTION AND MORAL JUDGMENT 557 itself significantly not in his generalizations but in his concrete exam- ples; and there is often a contradiction between the two.9 c) This means also that our agreements and disagreements "in prin- ciple" are mostly meaningless and empty. For the really relevant and meaningful agreements and disagreements are those which refer to the concrete facts and issues. Hence, again, not the generalizations but the exemplifications are "the real thing." Even if, for instance, all people were to agree with each other in general that they are "against preju- dices," they might, and probably would, find out that they refer in their minds to entirely different kinds of prejudices, and would therefore soon start again denouncing each other as being prejudiced: the one would denounce the prejudices of the "South" against the Negroes, the other the prejudices of the "North" against the "South." Hence, "being against prejudices" in general, does not mean actually anything in fact. And the same would apply perhaps even more so to the ambiguous concept of "tolerance": tolerant about what?, is here the only really significant issue. e) We have to keep in mind that each society, each social, or cultural group has its own peculiar collective blind spots, its own predominant forms of selective social blindness which define and defend what might be proiperly called its main sacred dogmas. Our debates, even our so- called great debates, therefore almost always proceed within the limits circumscribed by our sacred dogmas. This applies, particularly, to such nationalistically and ideologically excited and disturbed periods of his- tory as our own. f) It follows from the preceding that we are all much more willing to accept any kind of social criticism if and as long it remains on the general level "in principle," particularly so if the respective criticism is a threat to our "sacred dogmas." The resistance (in the psychoanalytic meaning of this term) makes itself intensely felt only if and when we are trying to apply our harmless generalizations "in principle," about which we mostly all agree, to some quite specific controversial case. We are, therefore, permitted and even entirely welcome to expose hypocrisy and intolerance "in general," but will mostly evoke a violent resentment if we touch and expose any concrete case of intolerance or hypocrisy which happens to be protected by the respective sacred dogmas. Hence, we have to keep in mind that not our generalizations, whatever their content.. out our concrete examples are actually most significant but at the price of being at the same time the most shocking. For it is they 9 I introduced the distinction between our attitudes "in principle" and our attitudes "in fact" for the first time iti 1930 in my Kritik des Erfolges (op. cit.) and applied it since then again and again in my various publications.</page><page sequence="13">558 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH which reveal what a given society is just trying to conceal. And they are the more shocking, the more "obvious" they are. How, then, shall we cope with these dilemmas? First of all, let us say that already the revealing and admitting of the fact that any exemplification we might be able to offer is indeed guided and misguided by our own selective social' perception, constitutes a kind of a cure. For it shows clearly that we are not blinded but well aware of the pitfalls we are here confronted with. It implies also an invitation to other authors, who might be interested in the same kind of problems, to correct our bias by presenting their own complementary exemplifi- cations which, to be sure, will also not be quite free from their bias. So, finally, a more balanced picture might emerge from all of these en- deavors. As far as the main and most perplexing dilemma is concerned, namely, that between either presenting examples which being most sig- nificant are also the most shocking ones, or presenting examples which, are quite "safe" but at the price of being quite ambiguous or empty, we decided to follow the path of a compromise. This decision is perhaps intellectually not very heroic, and certainly also not quite satisfactory, but is the best we can do! under the given circumstances. We wish, how- ever, to take the risk of saying, that, in our opinion, some of the war crimes trials would offer ample material for illustrating the paradoxes of our highly selective moral indignations. We shall, then, in the following (final) section select not those exam- ples which, being quite specific, would be most significant, because this would alienate some readers who otherwise might have been quite receptive to what we have to say; we shall rather'select examples which, being still sufficiently significant to illustrate realistically our point, will at the same time not be too shocking. And on the other hand, in exem- plifying, we shall not lose ourselves in empty and ambiguous generali- zations, but shall choose examples which, without being perhaps quite specific, are nonetheless sufficiently close to the concrete level to main- tain their realistic illustrative significance. In reading, then, our following illustrations, the reader will do well to keep in mind the difficulties and dilemmas with which, in making our choice, we had to cope. 3. Examples of some Paradoxes in our "Selective Moral Indignations" The moral contradictions and paradoxes which are the result of the various forms of our selective social perception, i.e., of the various forms of our social blindness, may manifest themselves both within the mind and behavior of a single person and between different persons and</page><page sequence="14">SOCIAL PERCEPTION AND MORAL JUDGMENT 559 between different groups. And they may refer selectively either to certain similar, or even identical, or to certain different, but nevertheless equally harmful social events or actions. Sometimes, therefore, it is the same person who is morally indignant about certain specific brutalities and at the same time, paradoxically, totally indifferent to other brutalities, which, in fact, are quite identical in character; this peculiar selection may be due to a different cultural background, to the fact that the respective brutalities either directly affect ourselves, or only other people who are indifferent to us, to the the social situation in which we ourselves happen to be placed, or to any of the other reasons which we enumerated on the preceding pages as controlling our selective social perception. Or again, the same person might be morally indignant about brutality, but at the same time not indignant about hypocrisy which, as a matter of fact, may disturb and poison a given society even more than brutality does; or vice versa. (Justice Felix Frankfurter made in his Reminiscences the characteristic comment that he despises hypocrites even more than barbarians, which shows that not only "militarists" but also some quite liberal-minded men feel this way.) 10 Sometimes, a certain group of people, let us say people A, may be indignant about certain kinds of brutalities (a), but indifferent to brutali- ties (b), while other people (B) may, on the contrary, be indifferent to brutalities (a), but indignant about brutalities (b). In such a case, and this is very significant in situations we are discussing here, the A-people will often not only be indignant about brutalities (a), without being indignant about brutalities (b), but will be also indignant about the B-people who, due to some peculiar perversion of their mind or their character, are not, as they ought to be, indignant about the same evils we are indignant ourselves; and vice versa. And the same, intra-individual as well as inter-individual and inter- group contradictions, manifest themselves in our being aware for in- stance, of the quite visible evils of militarism, but not being aware of the less visible and more elusive evils of commercialism which is de- structive by treating all values of life in terms of profit, or in our being aware of the evils of the power of violence, but not being aware of the evils of the power of money; or, in being aware of the obvious evils of war, but not being aware of the more surreptitious and disguised evils of an unjust "peace" which may, in fact, consist sometimes of nothing but exploitation, oppression, or even loss of independence; or in being aware of the atrocities committed during any war by our enemies, but 10 See my article "Fear of Violence and Fear of Fraud," Sociometry, VII, No. 4 (November, 1944), pp. 376-83.</page><page sequence="15">560 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH not being aware of similar atrocities committed during the same war by other nations, including possibly ourselves. We could multiply, of course, the examples ad infinitum. In a moral history of mankind, our age might even be aptly called the age of the selective moral indignations."1 We do not want to be misunderstood: we do not maintain that all those contradictions and paradoxes are always only the results of the variety and disparity of our different selective social perceptions. For sometimes the differences between our moral indignations are the result of different people reacting morally in different ways to an identical perception of the facts themselves. However, we do maintain that in a great many cases the perplexing paradoxes of our selective moral in- dignations are, indeed, manifestations not of different moral values, norms, and standards but of different people perceiving in different ways the world of facts. Finally, the following words of caution; even if we succeeded in clarifying and eliminating all those contradictions and paradoxes which are due to the confusion concerning the relationship between the factual social perception and the superimposed moral judgments, and even if we achieved a universal consensus concerning our moral values and standards, the disagreements and conflicts we are here discussing would still persist; for men would still continue to disagree with each other and fight each other because of -the different ways they see the relevant social facts, always insisting that they themselves see the facts "as they really are," while their opponents, due to some intellectual or moral perversion, are unable or unwilling to see, "as they really are," those very facts upon which are based all our moral and ideological involve- ments, actions, and reactions.
