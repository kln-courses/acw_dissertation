<plain_text><page sequence="1">ATTRIBUTES AND CATEGORIES IN THE STUDY OF MATERIAL CULTURE: NEW GUINEA DANI ATTIRE KARL G. HEIDER Brown University The first Encyclopedia of the social sciences, which presumably reflected both the knowledge and interests of the late I920's and early I930's, included articles on dress (Benedict I93I) and ornament (Bunzel I933). Its successor of the I960's, the International encyclopedia of the social sciences does not even have index entries for these subjects. An examination of ethnographical monographs shows that while earlier studies conscientiously described the material aspects of culture, this concern has become exceedingly rare in the I960's. The decline in interest in material culture is not easy to explain. The unpopu- larity of 'total' ethnographies, and the emphasis on specific theoretical problems has certainly been in part responsible. But there has always been a steady, if small, stream of anthropological works which are more than just catalogues of artefact collections, and which show how material culture is relevant to the most varied sorts of problems. Morgan's fifth section of Ancient society deals with the correlation of house types and social structure (i 88 i); Malinowski describes the sociology of the canoe (I922: chs. 4-6); more recently, Cunningham bases a description of Atoni social structure on the material details of the long house (I964); Levi-Strauss, in his essays on Bororo village plans (I963) and tattoo designs (I964) and his theo- retical statements (e.g. I966) has stressed the value of examining material culture; and Tippett (I968) has used Fijian material culture as the point of reference for his study of Fijian culture, showing how the artefacts themselves have been misunder- stood when treated apart from their total context, and going on to demonstrate how the understanding of Fijian cultural institutions is enhanced by an under- standing of the relevant artefacts. None of this is really surprising or revolutionary. What is surprising is the fact that there are so few works which deal with material culture in this manner. The most obvious explanation of the disinterest in material culture is that anthro- pology, the study of fashion, is itself subject to fashion. But it must also be recog- nised that material culture studies, with a few happy exceptions, have led into a descriptive jungle. The diligent cataloguing of material objects has added little of general interest to anthropological thinking, and its main stimulus has been in giving rise to larger and more comprehensive catalogues. To the extent that these catalogues have been exhaustive listings of all things, they have parodied functional- ism. The concept of functional interrelationships has been fruitful in directing anthropological analyses towards searching out interrelationships between traits. This concept starts with the assumption that all the traits of a culture are inter- related, but it goes quickly to the more important corollary that most of these</page><page sequence="2">3 80 KARL G. HEIDER interrelationships are so tenuous that they are not worthwhile pursuing, and that the significant interrelationships must be sought out. The main drawback to the usual material culture catalogue is not just that it is a fragmented listing, but that its use of categories is conceptually restrictive. One can assume that the most fertile material objects, those which will yield the most information to a functional investigation, have multiple functional relationships with other aspects of the culture. But if the conceptual scheme involves placing each object in a narrow category, narrowly defined, these multiple interrelation- ships will be obscured. On the other hand, it is possible to devise a conceptual scheme which will force attention towards the multiplicity of interrelationships. In this article, I shall outline such a conceptual framework for dealing with a small realm of the material culture of the New Guinea Dani'; survey the interrelationships of two particularly significant Dani objects, the carrying net and the penis gourd; and finally, consider the broader implications of using attribute dimensions rather than categories. Clothing, ornament and attire The categories 'clothing' and 'ornament' are highly ambiguous categories whose use unduly restricts functional analysis. But if one treats 'clothing' and 'ornament' as functional attributes rather than as exclusive categories, one can deal with objects of attire in a flexible classification system which facilitates broad functional analysis. The category 'attire' includes a large number of cultural objects relating specifically to the person, which are worn, carried, smeared, or hung on the body. 'Attire' as a category contrasts with other categories of portable objects which, because of their specialised functions, may be considered in the categories of 'tool', ' weapon', or 'utensil'. It will be obvious that there will still be problems of definition at the bound- aries of these larger categories. Such things as an ornamented spoon worn by a Tibetan woman from her belt, or a Dani woman's digging stick which can also serve as a defensive weapon, or the dress sword of a naval officer, each straddles a boundary. When dealing with such objects, then, attire, weapon, utensil and tool become attributes and not mutually exclusive categories. On the other hand, although in this article clothing is considered as a functional attribute rather than a category, it could be considered as a category if, for example, one were discussing different ways in which the Dani keep warm at night. In other words, what may be considered a defined category at certain levels of specificity may, at higher levels of generalisation, be best treated as a defining attribute. The most useful general defining features of objects of attire are of three sorts: functional attributes refer to the effect of an object's use, while the others, frequency and situational norms, and status norms, refer to the circumstances of its use. i. Functional attributes. In searching for the functional interrelationships between an object of attire and other aspects of culture, we can consider the specific purposes which an object serves, or the effects which the use of the object has. Some function- al attributes of the objects in the category of attire include: a. to protect the body against the elements; b. to conceal parts of the body;</page><page sequence="3">NEW GUINEA DANI ATTIRE 3 8 I c. for expressive decoration, including ornamentation; d. symbols of status; e. for magical reasons; and ? for transport of other items. These functional attributes are not mutually exclusive. Most objects which belong to the category of attire can be described in terms of more than one of these functional attributes. 2. Frequency and situational norms. The functions which an object serves must be qualified even further. Even when an object serves a function, it does not do so for all Dani at all times. One sort of qualifying norm refers to the frequency and situational patterns of use. Objects may be essential, or just usual, or merely accessory, and in many cases this is determined by the situation, or behavioural context. Thus an object which is essential in one setting may be only accessory or even absent in another. For example, if we look at objects which function to preserve sexual modesty, the essential objects are easily recognised as those without which no normal person appears in public. One can go further and describe a situational gradient. For example, in the United States of the I960's, coverage of certain body areas is an important function of adult women's attire, but this coverage is situationally specific. One might rank the following activities for women in terms of decreasing degrees of coverage: bride (veiled, in formal ceremony); participant in formal religious ceremony; cocktail party; swimming pool or beach; conjugal bed. The degree of coverage which is appropriate to one situation is inappropriate to another. Within the last year, high school girls have been dismissed from school for wearing 'granny dresses' (too long) and mini-skirts (too short). And of course, there may also be considerable change in these norms over time. The most modest beach wear of the European or American girl of the I960's would have been considered outrageously indecent a century before. 3. Status norms. Another sort of qualifying norm is status. The status of an individual, like his situation, may affect what objects of attire are used. For example, an adult Dani caught by rain in the gardens has several choices to avoid the wet, depending on sex. A man may take refuge in a watchtower shelter or an ordinary garden shelter, tie a large taro leaf over his hairdo, or hold a handful of leafy branches above himself; a woman may choose the ordinary garden hut or don a matted rain cape. Status may determine what objects are available to an individual, as in the above example. However, in some instances the objects may determine the status. Performance of the skier role both demands and is (in part) defined by the wearing of skis. In other words, a function of an object of attire may be to indicate a status of the user at the same time that the status of the user qualifies which object he may use for accomplishing certain functions. Usually, perhaps, attire does not actually define status, although the concepts of status symbol and disguise indicate that attire may be used in an attempt to define or assume a status. The wearing of a dress by an American male does not com- pletely define his status as female, but it does define him as being not of an un- ambiguously male status. In some cases it may be desirable to distinguish between</page><page sequence="4">3 82 KARL G. HEIDER these two cases by asking whether the use of an object defines the user as being of that status, or whether unless he is of that status, his use of the object is inappropriate. The status norms affecting Dani attire reflect dramatically the minimal presence of status differentiation in Dani society as a whole. Male v. female role behaviour is clearly differentiated, as is male v. female attire. The only attire which is normally shared by men and women is the neck piece protecting the base of the throat from ghostly attack, and the bark 'breech cloth' which may be worn by babies of either sex. The other examples prove the rule: young girls who have not yet begun to take on female roles and who thus can enter men's houses, also wear woven arm bands; men, in time of spiritual crisis, may conceal themselves from the ghosts by draping a woman's net over their heads; and women at the 'victory' dance may wear men's ornaments. In the first example, the little girls' status has not yet been firmly defined; in the second, the men's status is in jeopardy. The explanation for the third exception is not so clear, but it does seem that in the high emotional and ritual intensity of the victory dance, the normal rules are suspended. Age is also reflected in the attire in a similar but less decisive way. The major age break for the Dani occurs around two or three, when the child begins to walk and talk more or less competently, and when his soul matter is considered to have achieved normal size. Within a few years the child will begin regularly to wear a penis gourd or skirt, but these are not directly connected with the achievement of 'person-hood'. Boys' initiations occur sometime between about three and ten, and a girl goes through a minor ceremony at puberty, but neither of these is marked by changes of attire. The only major change of attire directly related to change of status takes place at a girl's marriage, when she begins to wear the woman's wound skirt in place of the girl's hanging skirt. Other than age, sex and marital status, there are virtually no major status distinctions in Dani society. There are leaders, of course, but leadership is of the Melanesian 'big man' sort, informal and relying on influence rather than power to initiate and direct group behaviour. There are no full-time or even part-time specialists in religious or economic activities, and even the most important big men tend their gardens and herd their pigs. Individuals do perform as spare-time specialists in such activities as directing a curing ceremony, bleeding a wounded man, or making arrow tips. The attire of the Dani reflects and even goes beyond this general egalitarianism. There are individual differences in attire, but these are more sartorial than status-linked. Generally speaking, there is no important differentia- tion of attire within the group of, say, adult men, just as there is minimal status differentiation within this group. Survey of Dani attire attributes The general view of Dani attire in terms of functional attributes is discussed below, and is summarised in table i. Climate protection. The climate of the Grand Valley of the Balim is remarkably temperate. Daytime temperatures rarely exceed 8o0F. and the coldest nights are never lower than 40?F. Pig grease rubbed on the body may give some protection against chilly days, and men's taro leaf caps and women's matted rain capes give some protection against rain. But for the most part, protection from rain and cold</page><page sequence="5">NEW GUINEA DANI ATTIRE 3 83 TABLE I. Dani personal attire. Male Female Essential: Nothing to about 3 years Nothing to about 2 years Penis gourd Girl's hanging skirt or Woman's wound skirt Usual: Woven arm bands Carrying nets Buttocks leaf 'tail' Baby: Bark cloth 'breech cloth' Neck gear Accessory: Arm bands: fur, pig scrotum Girls: woven arm band Wrist bands Rain cape Bailer shell Nassa shell 'bib' Other neck gear Cane belt Head net Spider web cap Leaf cap Seed wig Forehead band Headdress Feathers, in hair Tobacco net Back 'shield' (In edai dance: Feather whisk much male ornamentation) Feather wand is given in ways other than by attire: simple shelters in the gardens and rock over- hangs in the forests provide shelter for people caught abroad in rain; most Dani carry coals or fire-making equipment when they go to the gardens or into the forests, and kindle a small fire near their temporary base of operations to light cigarettes, and for warmth; and the well-built, round sleeping houses provide warmth throughout the night. Dani pattern of coverage. For the Dugum Dani the pattern of coverage is: Male and female children: the youngest children are not restricted at all, but between the ages of four and six (or, in the case of girls, two and four) they begin to conform to the pattern of adults of the appropriate sex. Female: the immediate genital area is covered by a skirt at all times. The back is covered (but not really concealed) at all times in public by a net hanging from the forehead. The net may be removed for coolness at midday or to bask in the early morning sun in the relative privacy of a garden or compound. Male: the penis is covered by a penis gourd at all times after about four to six years of age, except occasionally when working in muddy garden ditches or during sinuknuk seizures. Feeble-minded men who customarily go about naked,</page><page sequence="6">3 84 KARL G. HEIDER as reported from the lower Grand Valley and from the western Dani region (Schneider, personal communication) were never observed in the mid-valley. The anal region is sometimes covered (but only in a token manner) by a 'tail', a long leaf of cordyline or a bark strip which hangs from the waist string. Male and female: the upper sternum area is usually covered by ornaments or magic paraphernalia hanging from a neck cord. This is explained as protection against ghosts. Depilation: closely related to this pattern of modesty is the removal of all exposed hair with a pitch depilatory and, by men, of the facial hair around the mouth, leaving a ring beard. This was explained in terms of general, non-magical norms. Decoration. Feathers, furs, and mud and ash-blackened pig grease are the main elements of Dani decoration. Just as the Dani have relatively little status differentia- tion beyond that which is based on sex and age, so there is little in the way of status-specific ornamentation. There are no insignia of rank, and important men rarely wear finer ornaments than lesser men do. Men often wear ornamentation, but women practically never do. Men tend to be most elaborately ornamented in battle and at the edai or 'victory' dance, and least ornamented while engaged in manual labour, but there are many exceptions even to these generalisations. Of course there are individual differences, but many of these seem to stem from personal inclinations to elegance rather than from status or other norms. Much attire has only ornamental function, but it is difficult to draw a line between the feather and body-mud designs which are explicitly referring to the bird of the mortality myth, and those which are worn for non-ritual display. Most objects of attire can be enhanced ornamentally by the addition of furs, feathers, mud, flowers, or vegetal colouring. Magical purposes. Some Dani attire serves to conceal and protect parts of the body from ghosts, but it is often difficult to separate this supernatural function from the general norms mentioned above. The base of the throat, and secondarily the anal region, are most vulnerable to ghostly attack. The former is usually concealed, the latter only sometimes concealed, by objects with ritual power such as the bark cloth neck strips, or the cordyline leaf anal strip.2 Other objects of attire, such as the pig scrotum arm bands, give a more general- ised protection against ghosts. Wounded or sick men, i.e. those with weakened soul matter, wear large nets loosely draped over their heads to conceal their presence from ghosts. And in ceremonies, people smear clay on their bodies in symbolic identification with the bird of the mortality myth. Transport. Transport is a minor function of Dani attire. The women's back nets are used to carry babies, shoats, or garden produce. Men sometimes use small tobacco nets to carry cigarette material and small tools. Some small tools such as needles, awls and pig tusk scrapers may be slipped under an arm band or through an ear lobe. But most objects are simply carried in the hands, or, if they are too large, over the shoulder or on top of the head. Two objects of attire Detailed analysis of two key items of Dani attire, the woman's carrying net and the man's penis gourd, will demonstrate the specific application of this approach.</page><page sequence="7">NEW GUINEA DANI ATTIRE 3 8 5 i. The woman's carrying net Description and manufacture. The woman's carrying net, called su, is a large string bag about 75 cm. square with a wide mouth and a forehead strap. Similar nets are the man's 'tobacco net' (hanom su), a small netted pouch worn over the shoulder by men and used to carry cigarette makings and miscellaneous small tools; and the man's 'head net' (ugul su), a net cap worn by some men. The Dani net is not a knotted net, but a knitted net with loose open loops. The nets are made by women or older girls. The maker alternately knits the net and extends the end of the string by rolling fibres into it on her thigh, so that in fact each net is made of a single string. The only implement involved in the knitting is a small stick, split at one end to hold the loose string, which is used to draw the string through the loops. Before netting, the string may be coloured by a red clay, a blue-purple flower base, or a yellow-to-orange root. The string may also be decorated by strips of brightly coloured orchid fibre wound around it. Although the general term su is used for all nets, there are several specific names for various kinds of carrying nets. However, repeated questioning of women and girls failed to produce a consistent system of net classification. Three names were used with some consistency. Nets with orchid fibre decoration are generally not made in the Dugum neighbourhood, but are traded in from the Gutima area in the southern Grand Valley, and are called gutima su. Nets traded in from the jalemo are called jale su. The long rectangular nets, open along two sides, which are usually reserved for the funeral exchange, but are sometimes worn by women, are called tegetagi. The apparent absence of sub-classification of women's nets in the Dugum neighbourhood contrasts with the situation in the Konda Valley Western Dani area, where Denise O'Brien found an elaborate and consistent scheme of net classification (personal communication). Old, frayed nets are sometimes mended with new string. After they are no longer mendable, they may still be worn for cover, or they may be unravelled for string. When a net is beyond repair, it is hung on a convenient tree limb outside the compound to rot. Informants insisted that this had no particular significance. Names for the parts of a carrying net suggest some anthropomorphic symbol- ism, corresponding roughly to the English terminology. The body of the net is ebe, body; the mouth is ape, mouth; the carrying strap is adle, which is also the term for bow string and tendon. All nets have a free-ended string several centimetres long, hanging somewhere along the carrying strap. This string is called ilaka, which also means eyebrow. No informant was able-or willing-to explain this. Analysis. It is convenient to call a su a woman's carrying net because sus are used by women for carrying things. A man only uses a su to carry sacred or exchange objects to a ceremony; or, when his soul matter is diminished and in danger because of a wound or the death of a friend, he might drape a su over his head to mute his presence, or to conceal himself from the ghosts. Women use the nets constantly for carrying babies, garden produce or small pigs. But the su is much more than just a device for transport. Women wear nets constantly and only rarely, in the privacy of her own house or a deserted garden, does a woman take off her nets. Although a woman's nets do not completely con- ceal her back, a stranger is as likely to see the fully naked back of a Dani woman as</page><page sequence="8">3 86 KARL G. HEIDER he is to see the naked breasts of an American woman. (However, the Dani do not seem to associate a decolletage eroticism with the net and the back.) Women usually wear from two to six nets, of which only one or two are actually used for trans- port. The outer net is usually decorated, either with the soft colourings of the string of a local net, or the more garish orchid fibre of imported nets. The nets do afford the woman some protection against sun. When a woman has given birth, she uses a set of new nets. The baby lies horizontally on a soft grass 'nest' in the bottom net, against the mother's back, while the outer nets lie over it, shielding the child from the light. A child spends most of his first year in the net, cradled against the back of his mother or a young girl baby sitter. Nets, like pigs and shells, are commonly used in ceremonial exchange, and are given out to women in the funeral ceremony, on the day after the cremation. 2. The penis gourd Description and manufacture. The holim, or penis gourd, is the only essential men's garment. Basically, it is a narrow gourd tube which covers the penis and holds it erect. It is about the diameter of the penis, which is slipped all the way inside it. It is held in place by two strings: a small loop tied through holes in the lower end of the gourd, which encircles part of the scrotum and often at least one testicle; and an upper string which passes around the waist and is fixed to the upper end of the gourd or, if it is a long gourd, to the middle. Penis gourds come in several shapes and sizes. There is the small token gourd sometimes worn dangling from the waist string of a male baby or infant. The gourds which are actually worn by boys or men may be short and straight, about 10-20 cm. long. These are sometimes worn in battle or during vigorous work because of the ease of keeping them on; longer straight gourds may rise to an elegant length of 6o cm. or more, rising above the shoulder; gourds of middle length may be curved or even curled at the end. The Grand Valley Dani gourds are distinctive, tending to be long, narrow, and worn nearly vertically. Visitors to the Grand Valley from the Western Dani areas are particularly noticeable with their short, thick penis gourds, often io cm. in diameter, standing out at a 45 degree angle from the wearer's body. Gourds are grown near compounds, where they are carefully shaped as they grow. As soon as the vine is large enough, it is trained up a framework which holds it about I. metres above the ground. As the gourds mature, they are trained: if a long straight gourd is desired, a stone weight is tied to the end of the gourd, drawing it out. Later, if a curve or curl is desired, the gourd is bent to the hori- zontal or even upside down, and lashed to the pole of the frame. Often the gourd is wrapped with gisakpel, the inner banana bark, to prevent its darkening in the sun. When the gourd is grown to the desired size, the tips are cut off; it is roasted over coals to harden the shell and soften the meat; the meat is gouged out with a bamboo knife; the outer skin is scraped off; and the gourd is carefully wrapped and hung to dry behind the fire of the men's house. After a few days, when it is dry and before it has begun to discolour from the smoke of the fire, it is removed to be stored on the wall of the men's house. Each man has several spare or new gourds in storage, and frequently changes his</page><page sequence="9">NEW GUINEA DANI ATTIRE 3 8 7 gourd, or even gives one to a visitor who wants one of a particular shape. When needed, the gourd is unwrapped; two holes are bored near the base for the scrotum string; if necessary a hole is made at the tip for the waist string; the string is usually newly-rolled; and the man, carefully turning his back, fixes the new gourd in position. Gourds, especially the longer ones, are frequently broken. If only the tip is broken, it may simply be inserted, wedged into the opening, or a new hole bored and the waist band moved down to the new tip. If the base is broken, the gourd will be replaced, but the broken piece is put to the side for possible future use. The penis gourd may be ornamented in several ways. A forest marsupial's tail fur 20-30 cm. long, held rigid by a stick inside, may be stuck upright into the end hole of the gourd. Another sort of fur tassel is limp and hangs loose with the bare prehensile tip of the tail inserted into the tip of the gourd. These fur tassels are usually of dark fur, but occasionally are embellished by an end piece of light fur of another animal. The spiked cocoon of the case moth, called pumpalep, may serve as a dangling tassel at the end of a straight gourd, or be fixed to the middle of a long gourd or a curled gourd. Pumpalep, considered magic lures for women, are usually worn by older men. Also, a few greased strips of bark cloth or strings may dangle from the middle of the gourd. Although the tip of a curled penis gourd may simply be the natural end of the gourd, on a straight gourd this end has been cut off and the end hole plugged with a stopper (tabpit). If there is no tassel, a wad of dried banana bark is used. Analysis. We may now use the attributes outlined above as a framework for the analysis of the gourd and its place in Dani culture. As already mentioned, each Dani male from about six years onwards wears a penis gourd in all public situations. No Dani female ever wears a penis gourd, although in victory dances, women often wear other specifically male objects, such as shell neckpieces and feather headdresses. The penis gourd certainly does not protect the body against the elements in any discernibly useful way. Also, it is not a good protection against arrows, since it is so brittle. In fact, by holding the penis upright, it increases the genital area exposed to arrows. The penis gourd does conceal the penis, and this sexual modesty is the only reason given by the Dani themselves for the function of the gourd. The great variety of lengths and shapes of gourds seems to offer cues about the personalities of the wearers. The gourds are so obviously extensions of the penis that it would seem at first glance that there must be a difference between a straight shoulder-length gourd, a gourd with a drooping curl, and a short finger-length gourd. In fact, however, each man has a wardrobe of gourds of several sizes and shapes which he wears alternately. It is conceivable that a man picks his gourd according to his mood of the day, but I found no evidence of this. At best it seems that old men often wear tightly curled gourds, but even this is far from regular. Moreover, the fur tassels which are sometimes worn on the gourds show no more correlation with status or personality than do shapes of the gourds themselves. There are some other symbolic uses of the gourd worth mentioning. First, the gourd is used as a symbol for a fellow sib member by a man-the word for penis gourd may be used, or the gourd may be tapped, indicating the agnatic relationship. Second, during the 'renewal' ceremony (pelabi) marking the end of the mourning</page><page sequence="10">3 8 8 KARL G. HEIDER period, the stated norm is for all people involved to discard their mourning skirts or penis gourds for new ones. In fact, in the observed instances only a few of the boys did this. Third, the noisy flicking of the gourd by the fingernail of the fore- finger punctuates the more dramatic conversations. This flicking has the same range of meanings as the word naijuk-I am afraid, I am impressed. Finally, how- ever, the penis gourd does not seem to serve any magical purpose, and except for an occasional needle stuck in the wadding at the tip of the gourd, penis gourds are not used for transporting other items. At this point in the analysis, we can turn to the cross-cultural data. Phallocrypts of this sort, although typical of the western two-thirds of the New Guinea high- lands, are by no means confined to that region. Examples from many other regions have been described and analysed. Plaited penis sheaths have been reported from South America and Africa. Nordenskiold describes the South American distribution of three different kinds of treatment of the penis: the 'penis cover apparently usually a plaited penis sheath; the prepuce tied with a thread; and the penis held upright, tucked under a waist belt. These traits are spread across the entire north-eastern half of the continent (Nordenski6ld I9I9: I47-54, map I9). Ankermann mentions the presence of penis sheaths from western, eastern and southern Africa (I905: 62, map III), and says that they occur in various forms: 'woven sheaths, small gourds or other vegetal covers, cocoons of insects, and finally, also sacks of leather or cotton cloth' (I905: 64). Possibly analogous to these penis sheaths worn by men are long erect penis-like tubes worn by women in central Africa, as reported by Muraz (I932). Again, Le Roux gives a fine survey of the occurrence in New Guinea of the penis gourd and other phallocrypts (I948: I37-5I). However, the codpiece of late medieval and early Renaissance Europe is perhaps a more familiar example of the exaggerating phallocrypt. Laver says that: ... the most extraordinary item of Tudor male clothing is undoubtedly the bragetto, or cod- piece. All subsequent ages have regarded it with surprise mingled with horror, and it is inter- esting to note that when the drawings of Holbein were reproduced in facsimile in the eighteenth century the codpiece was omitted. It was anything but discreet, being puffed out and exaggerated and even adorned with the puffmgs and slashings characteristic of the rest of the male outfit (I95I: 8). The penis sheath, and similar objects, have often been explained in terms of pride in and emphasis on the primary sign of maleness. For example, Westermarck rejected the modesty explanation and insisted that the basic object of all clothing was for sexual enticement (I92I: chs. I5, I6). Benedict described the New Guinea penis gourd together with the fifteenth century European codpiece as 'indicative of the exhibitionist nature of certain forms of dress' (I93 I: 236). It is difficult to see the pertinence of any of these explanations in the Dani case. Explicit sexual activity and concern, and phallic emphasis are remarkably low in Dani culture. It is, of course, possible that psychological or psycho-analytical investigation of the Dani would be more revealing, but no such studies have been carried out. The psychological interpretation of the gourd as a symbolic erection and the fur tassel as a symbolic orgasm (e.g. Le Roux I948: I48) is possible, but I observed nothing in the Dani culture to support this interpretation. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the Dani penis gourd is that it is not, in any explicit way, a focus of Dani sexuality or eroticism.</page><page sequence="11">NEW GUINEA DANI ATTIRE 3 89 Attribute dimensions and profiles In summary, a systematic analysis of the Dani net and penis gourd shows both what they are and what they are not. It has been necessary to go beyond mere description, and it has been necessary to use a conceptual scheme which directs inquiry in many different directions. It is quite conceivable that an ingenious analysis of the net or the penis gourd could begin by placing them within the limitations of a single-function category like clothing and then go on to examine other functions. But this would still necessitate working under the handicap of the limiting categories. Such an analysis would depend for its effectiveness on an implicit conceptual scheme working at cross purposes to the explicit one. The purpose of this article has been to propose a conceptual scheme which, by sub- stituting attributes for categories, will force the analysis to take the broadest possible lines. Categories are means of summarising the coincidences of a number of values which exist on different attribute dimensions. If these attribute dimensions are continuous, the values are relative; if the attribute dimensions are discontinuous, the values are absolute. But the categories too often are like biscuit cutters which remove pieces from a sheet of dough. The results are elegant, manageable, neatly- bound, but unreal. Human biology offers convenient illustrations. For present living forms, the categories human and non-human are satisfactory; the categories male and female are not as accurate, because there are transition forms, but since these are relatively rare, the categories are still relatively satisfactory. The cate- gories 'Negro', 'Oriental', and 'Caucasian' are unsatisfactory because there are so many transition forms between the ideal types, and these ideal types are based on only a limited number of the known genetic variables of the human body. That humans vary physically is obvious; that the important human biological attributes co-vary is probably false. Much of anthropological literature is concerned with how to handle variations from ideal types. Race is just one example of this concern. Other notorious examples are magic, science and religion; clan and sib; law and custom; foraging, horticulture and agriculture; art and play; and, as discussed in this article, clothing. These categories themselves are not completely wrong, for they are attempts to point out variations in closely-related institutions or behaviours. But they impose a false order to the data, and direct attention away from the real problems of the variables themselves. An excellent example is Evans-Pritchard's comparison of Zande and Trobriand magic (I929) written in reaction to Malinowski's definition of magic (I925), which was based on Trobriand data. Evans-Pritchard pointed out that in many ways, Zande magic was similar to that of the Trobriands, but that in other dimensions it differed. The question was not whether the Zande had magic or not. What Malin- owski was getting at with his definitions of magic, science and religion, was a number of closely-related types of human behaviour which differed along several dimensions. But he assumed that these different dimensions were so interrelated that they varied together. This is conceivable, but it has not been shown to be true. It would be possible to think of these dimensions as a series of parallel lines, and then draw across the lines two profiles, one for Trobriand 'magic', and the other</page><page sequence="12">390 XARL G. HEIDER for Zande 'magic'. Then, cross-cultural comparisons could be made on the basis of the profile variables, rather than on the basis of the sterile category 'magic'. In the same way, clothing or ornament are not useful in themselves for cross-cultural comparison, as are the dimensions of 'protection from the elements', or 'orna- mentation', which are non-exclusive attributes of things. Although absolute categories still have a strangle-hold on much of the anthro- pological literature, there have been a few attempts to break away. Fallers, in asking if 'African cultivators are to be called peasants', pointed out that 'the concept "peasant societies" refers to a bundle of features which do not always go together' (I96I: I08). He suggested that if one thinks of'peasantness' in economic, political and cultural terms, the answer is yes for the first two dimensions and no for the third. A more elaborate approach along these lines was offered by Kopytoff (I964) in his consideration of categories of religious movements. He rejected the use of absolute categories such as 'nativistic movement', or 'cargo cult', and proposed a profile of religious movements based on some seventy attribute dimensions. Lomax (I968) and his associates in the Columbia University Canto- metrics Project have described song styles in terms of profiles which are based on thirty-seven different attribute dimensions. The attribute dimension profile is a flexible approach, and it does not seem useful to formulate rigid rules for its application. The choice of dimensions is based on research interests. In this article I have focused on functional attributes of objects of attire, and have not attempted to incorporate such formal dimensions as size, material of manufacture, or the like. Lomax, on the other hand, analyses his data from tape recordings of songs and uses only formal musical dimensions without regard for the behavioural context of the song. Also, it is worth emphasising that this approach does not in some mysterious manner do away with categories alto- gether. It does avoid the a priori categories like cargo cult or clothing, which might be called middle level categories. Higher level categories like religious movements or attire, and the attribute dimensions, which are themselves categories of sorts at a lower level, remain intact. It might well be that different studies, with different goals, would focus on them and find it useful to consider them in terms of attribute dimensions. Thus attire might become a constricting category in a study of arte- facts in general, or religious movements might be viewed in a context which included political movements. In summary, the use of attribute dimensions rather than absolute categories permits the treatment of cultural traits with maximal selection and minimal distortion of whatever aspects may be relevant for a particular line of investigation.
