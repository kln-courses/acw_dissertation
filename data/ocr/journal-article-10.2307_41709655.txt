As a forum for interdisciplinary inquiry, the journal features articles that explore intersections between theoretical work in rhetoric and writing studies, broadly conceived, and theoretical work in other fields. Also featured are articles on cultural studies and critical literacy; visual rhetorics, including film and media; rhetorical approaches to literary study; workplace literacies; computers and cyberculture; and the politics of higher education. J AC publishes articles on pedagogical theory but does not accept articles that merely describe classroom practices.
