<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> CHAPTER FOUR A GOD WHY IS HERMES HUNGRY?1 Ǹλλὰ ξύνοικον, πρὸς θεῶν, δέξασθέ με. (But by the gods, accept me as house-mate) Ar. Plut 1147 1. Hungry Hermes and Greedy Interpreters In the evening of the first day of his life baby Hermes felt hungry,  or, more precisely, as the Homeric Hymn to Hermes in which the  god’s earliest exploits are recorded, says, “he was hankering after flesh”  (κρειῶν ἐρατίζων, 64). This expression reveals only the first of a long  series of riddles that will haunt the interpreter on his slippery journey  through the hymn. After all, craving for flesh carries overtly negative  connotations.2 In the Homeric idiom, for instance, the expression  is exclusively used as a predicate of unpleasant lions.3 Nor does it  1 This chapter had been completed and was in the course of preparation for the  press when I first set eyes on the important and innovative study of the Hymn to  Hermes by D. Jaillard, Configurations d’Hermès. Une “théogonie hermaïque” (Kernos  Suppl. 17, Liège 2007). Despite many points of agreement, both the objectives and the  results of my study widely diverge from those of Jaillard. The basic difference between  our views on the sacrificial scene in the Hymn (which regards only a section of my  present chapter on Hermes) is that in the view of Jaillard Hermes is a god “who sac- rifices as a god” (“un dieu qui sacrifie en tant que dieu,” p. 161; “Le dieu n’est donc, à  aucun moment de l’Hymne, réellement assimilable à un sacrificateur humain,” p. 125),  while I regard “the actor Hermes as pictured in a fully human perspective throughout  the scene” (below p. 322). Differences between our interpretations of related scenes  from other literary sources are all affected by this primary controversy. In the pres- ent circumstances the best course of action seemed to me to retain my main text  unchanged, while reserving my responses to his treatment to the footnotes. I have  severely restricted myself to themes immediately relevant to the gist of my theory,  especially to Jaillard’s Ch. II: ‘Configurations hermaiques du sacrifice’. 2 On the palette of different connotations the expression may have had, see: Haft  1996, 38 f.  3 The negative association returns when the expression is used a second time in  the hymn, namely in v. 287, where Apollo prophecies Hermes’ future life as a brig- and “robbing lonely herdsmen in mountain glades, coming on their herds, hankering  after flesh.” To project the lion’s carnal appetite onto the heroes Aias (Il. 11.551) and  Menelaos (Il. 17.660), who are compared with the hungry lion (so: Haft 1996, 48  </page> <page sequence="2"> 310 chapter four p articularly suit the context in the Homeric hymn. In both characters  assigned to him, that of an infant and that of a god, Hermes should  have been the very last person to fancy a meaty dish. Babies, even  divine babies, are hankering after milk, as Hermes himself, once it  suits his purpose later in the hymn, helpfully reminds both his vindic- tive brother Apollo and the amused reader (267). Nor should, in a  mythological context, a god betray an interest in the consumption of  flesh unless served in the culinary speciality of knise (steam rising from  the burnt mêria wrapped in fat). Not by nature worried about negative connotations, hungry baby  Hermes sets out and manages to steal the cattle of his brother Apollo.  After having kindled a fire in a bothros (hearth pit) he kills two of the  immortal cows—both physically and linguistically a rare tour de force.4  He slaughters them by flinging them on their backs and piercing their  spinal cords. Next, he chops them up, prepares the meat, roasts it, and  divides it into twelve equal portions distributed by lot, making each  portion an honorary offering for each of the twelve gods.5 After thus  having dished up the cows, the infant feels he could eat a horse. “Even  though he is a god” (καὶ ἀθάνατόν περ ἐόντα), he is literally tormented  by the sweet savour (ὀδμή) of the roasted meat (note: not by the knise  of burnt meat: there was no knise, for there was no burnt meat).6 Yet,  n. 39, as does P. Pucci in: Benjamin 1988, 134 f. regarding Sarpedon in Il. 12, 300 ff.)  is to overburden the simile and fall prey to ‘totalizing’ the comparison (cf. below  p. 469). The simile’s dominant concern is fierceness in battle, not appetite. Cf. also:  St.H. Lonsdale, Creatures of Speech: Lion, Herding, and Hunting Similes in the Iliad  (Stuttgart 1990) espec. 49–70; M. Clarke, Between Lions and Men: Images of the Hero  in the Iliad, GRBS 36 (1995) 137–159. The negative image of the Homeric lion is not  affected by alleged allusions in Homer to the cultivated lion hunt as common in the  Near East: M. Alden, Lions in Paradise, CQ 55 (2005) 335–342. 4 The trick is not unique though: the comrades of Odysseus did the same with the  immortal cattle of the Sun. Cf. Burkert 1984, 842. On the possible meaning of the  words βόες ἄμβροτοι, see below n. 38.  5 I will be silent on the question of the identity of the twelve. See, most recently,  Johnston 2003, 169. However, it seems to me inevitable that—with the exception per- haps of the residents of the Olympia region—the general Greek listener to the hymn  would identify them as the twelve Olympians.  6 This ‘note’ occurred already in the very first draft of the Sather lecture that I gave  at Berkeley in 1999. It now turns out to be a seminal one. Jaillard 2007, 105 f., espec.  n. 33, in his drive to make Hermes’ curious sacrificial activities, however deviant and  unseemly for a god, nonetheless compatible with divine behaviour, argues that as a  rule gods do enjoy the delicious odours rising from the sacrificial meat. His evidence  for this generic statement, however, almost exclusively consists of references to knise  (the product of burnt mêria wrapped in fat) rising from regular ‘Olympian’ sacrifice,  and not to the odme coming from the roasted meat (as in the hymn). As these two  are distinctly dissimilar elements in descriptions of sacrifice one should refrain from  </page> <page sequence="3">  a god: why is hermes hungry? 311 he resists the temptation to gulp it down his holy throat. In these lines,  then, we are confronted with the first identity crisis recorded in Greek  literature. As compared to normal sacrificial practice as we know it, the whole  scene bristles with alarming anomalies. The manner of the slaughter- ing, the nature of the ‘altar’ (if we may call it an altar), the way in  which the meat is prepared, distributed, and made available for con- sumption: everything is abnormal. The ritual definitely does not qual- ify as a customary Olympian sacrifice, which is characterized by the  burning of the god’s portion, usually at a bomos, an elevated altar, not  by serving it to the gods as roasted pieces at stone slabs. Nor does it  resemble a so-called ‘chthonic’ sacrifice, which the bothros might call  to mind, but which is generally associated with holocausts or different  types of total destruction.7 The curious method of killing does not fit  either of these two types of regular sacrifice.8 Perhaps the whole scene  equating the two. Such an equation becomes even more questionable since it neces- sitates smoothing over the ‘author’s’ own explicit clue that Hermes “even though he  is a god” felt attracted by the sweet savour of the roasted meat, implying that this is  not a craving appropriate for gods. Hence it is precisely this expression that necessar- ily implies the most obvious solution to J.’s worried observation that “the gods have  not smelled anything at all” (“En un mot les dieux n’ont rien ‘senti’ ” p. 110). They  have not, because there was no knise, appropriate for divine nostrils, but ‘only’ odme,  exclusively suitable for human olfaction. Up to this point, references to trapezomata  and splanchna as tokens of divine carnivorous propensity (“Les dieux . . . . sont à leur  façon ‘carnivores’ p. 106) are out of order since they mix up categories. I will show  that, although gods indeed may ritually be treated to such solid sacrificial gifts, the  literary sources, which do abound with gods who avidly “sniff ” knise, never picture  them as actually partaking of these solid foodstuffs. The only constant divine excep- tion, significantly, is Hermes! The stark inconsistency in that, first, different from  Hermes, all the (other) gods are obviously supposed not to crave meat, and, next,  Hermes nevertheless treats them to this very delicacy, is a hermeneutic nightmare  that no interpreter of whatever denomination has been able to tackle along lines of  logic and coherence. I will argue that the only way out of this aporia is by taking the  inconsistency seriously and valuing it as a (conscious or even unconscious) poetic  stratagem to instil the ambivalent nature of the god (both human and divine) into the  minds of the audience. 7 On the precariousness of the opposition Olympian-chthonian (gods and sac- rifices) see above Ch. I p. 144. For chthonian sacrifice especially Ekroth 2002. On  distinctive vagueness of altars in visual art: G. Ekroth, Altars on Greek Vases: The  Identification of Bomos and Eschara, in: Ch. Scheffer (ed.), Ceramics in Context. Pro- ceedings of the Internordic Colloquium on Ancient Pottery Held at Stockholm 1997  (Stockholm 2001) 115–126. 8 The peculiar type of manipulation of the two cows has, of course, been explained  as an exponent of ephebic rituals of ‘carrying the bull’ (Burkert 1984, 837, 843 f.), just  as the cattle-raiding is in the centre of interest with respect to ephebic or initiatory  ritual: Haft 1996; Johnston 2002 and 2003.  </page> <page sequence="4"> 312 chapter four does not even depict a sacrifice at all.9 The god’s only decent move is  that, after serious consideration and not without reluctance, he decides  to refrain from consumption. The result, 2500 years after the recording of these events, is a bewil- dering confusion in the scholarly literature. It was once phrased in an  unbeatably Prussian manner by Von Wilamowitz 1931, 324 n. 0: “Man  versteht überhaupt nicht, was das schlachten soll” (We have no inkling  of what all this slaughtering is about), and the enigma has given rise  to perplexingly sophisticated discussions among scholars of the late  twentieth century, who are generally less disposed to easy surrender.  The plethora of ingenious modern interpretations includes two typical  exponents of the major trends in late twentieth century scholarship. In her book Hermes passe (Paris 1978) Laurence Kahn argues  that the various inversions in the sacrificial picture are intended to  construct an imaginary “anti-sacrifice” in which the rules governing  Olympian sacrifice, established to define the distinctions between gods  and mortals, are perverted. Such a sacrifice cannot and does not exist  in reality but is a deliberate literary creation by an ingenious author.  The inversion of ritual norms as exemplified in the systematic con- fusion of sacrificial vocabulary is intended to signify the ambiguous  nature of Hermes, betraying as it does both divine and human traits.  The language of Kahn’s book is French, its perfume Paris.10  9 Clay 1989, 118–127, disputes the generally accepted view that Hermes offers a  sacrifice (whatever its nature), but interprets it as a dais eïse (δαὶς ἐίση), a feast entail- ing the consumption of meat among friends and guests. She is followed by Haft 29;  39. Cf. also N.O. Brown, Hermes the Thief (Madison 1947, repr. 1969) 107 f.; 126, and  on dais eïse below n. 173. Jaillard 2007 interprets the pieces of roasted meat presented  to the gods in the light of trapezomata, to which we shall return. 10 Likewise Furley 1981, 38–63, after listing the anomalies and perversions in the  sacrificial scene, introduces a different, mildly structuralistic interpretation, arguing  that this is a case of—in the words of Cl. Lévi-Strauss—“speculations with alternatives  to the norm together with their disadvantages and dangers.” Such speculations “justify  the shortcomings of reality, since the extreme positions are only imagined in order to  show that they are untenable.” Jaillard 2007, 101–108, in a more differentiated manner  also following the lead of the Paris school, cannot deny the unmistakable allusions to  human traits in Hermes’ nature (“ambivalent entre mortel et immortel”; “caractère  si ‘naturellement’ humain, trop humain”). However, since he interprets the scene as  the first step in the “passage d’un type d’espace divin à un autre” (which in his view  is the dominating theme in the ‘théogonie’ of the hymn: “de l’age de l’ambrosie à la  knise”), he is forced to discard this aspect as being of secondary importance (“subor- donné à d’autres enjeux plus décisifs”). His overall rejection of Hermes “comme ce  dieu ‘mineur’ trop proche des hommes pour être pleinement divin” is largely based  on mythical narrative, the Hymn in particular, and ignores the textual categories on  which my own, quite opposite, vision is grounded.  </page> <page sequence="5">  a god: why is hermes hungry? 313 As far as I know, not one of Walter Burkert’s publications is so pro- nounced in its contestation of a specific interpretation as his point- blank rejection of Kahn’s ideas six years later.11 On the basis of a  near-Frazerian collection of very heterogeneous evidence gathered  from widely different sources and regions,12 he manages to provide  parallels for all ritual features denounced by Kahn as uncannonical.  Every single detail of the sacrifice, he argues, can be recovered in exist- ing ritual. Consequently, the sacrificial scene in the hymn may well  reflect a local ritual in honour of Hermes and the twelve gods betray- ing clear references to an Arcadian ambience probably from the vicin- ity of Olympia,13 of which only glimpses have come down to us. His  conclusion is that if there are antitheses, they are inherent in the ritual  itself, and should not be attributed to a conscious poetical inversion  of that ritual.14 Clearly, we are here confronted with another antithesis: the one  between two opposite, radically different and apparently incompatible  views concerning the interpretation of ancient evidence on ritual and  religion. Seldom did this choque des opinions receive a more poignant  expression than in the present discussion. For the second time in this  book, I am of course referring to the great debate between the two  most eminent champions in the study of Greek religion of the second  half of the twentieth century: Walter Burkert and Jean-Pierre Vernant,  to whose “École de Paris” the work of Laurence Kahn so obviously  11 Burkert 1984. I exclude his occasional reactions to criticism of his own theories  such as: Killing in sacrifice. A reply, Numen 25 (1977) 77–79; Response, Religion 30  (2000) 283 ff. On structuralism in general there is his invective in Burkert 1979, 10–14,  and cf. above p. 31. 12 In Horstmanshoff e.a. 2002, 18 f., he adds another fascinating parallel of the sac- rificial scene in a recently found Sumerian myth of King Lugalbanda and the origin  of animal sacrifice. This has escaped J. Larson, Lugalba and Hermes, CPh 100 (2005)  1–16, who analyses the parallels in more detail.  13 The region is very ‘Hermaic’: Strabo 8.3.12.343 reports that there were many  herms on the roads there. But, there were more in and around Athens, which boasted  that it was a Pelagian heritage: Hdt. 2.51.1. For the Attic origin see: Paus. 1.24.3, and  for the Attic tetragonal form: Paus. 4.33.3. 14 Literally: “Se sono antitesi, sono nei rituali stessi, e non nella relazione del testo  alla normalitá delle pratiche sacrificiali” (838). Clay 1989, 118, contends that certain  elements remain strange, for instance a pit hearth for Olympian sacrifice, and it is the  conjunction (her italics) of elements that appear contradictory. Adding: “Even if we  knew that the activity described in the poem was exactly re-enacted in cult, we would  not be excused from interpreting that activity in the context of the mythological narra- tive.” I could not agree more and wish here to acknowledge my debt to her innovative  study of the hymn, even if I will follow my own track. </page> <page sequence="6"> 314 chapter four belongs. I have given a brief presentation of the core of this debate  in the first chapter and it would be difficult to find a more apposite  illustration of it then the present clash of interpretations. Indeed, the interpretation of sacrifice in general is one of the two  focuses of the great debate, as for instance Le sacrifice dans l’antiquité  (1981) exemplarily reveals.15 The other focus is of a different nature,  but more relevant to the issue of the present chapter. It concerns the  question of the nature of the Greek gods against the background of the  structure of the Greek pantheon. Here, again, the ‘École de Paris’ takes  an explicit position. We have discussed their ideas about the society of  the gods in the first chapter. The Greek pantheon is a system of clas- sification, a particular way of ordering and conceptualising the uni- verse, which means that the world of the gods is an organised system  implying definite relations between the various gods. This entails—or  is grounded on—a special conception of the nature of individual gods.  The central dogma is thus summarized by Vernant: The Greek gods are not individuals each with a particular single charac- teristic form and spiritual life. The Greek gods are powers, not persons.16 15 A good critical discussion of the sacrificial theories of Burkert, Vernant/Detienne  and others: C. Grottanelli, Uccidere, donare, mangiare, in: Grottanelli &amp; Parise 1988,  3–53, on the Paris school espec. 5–8; the latter also in M. Vegetti, I Greci sono come  gli altri? Materiali filosofici 3 (1980) 265–272. Important also and with full literature:  Peirce 1993, which is basically a critique of Burkert’s theory of sacrifice as being essen- tially the destruction of life including the feelings of fear and guilt it arouses. Attic  vase painting shuns the killing act and celebrates the revelry aspects (the same conclu- sion and more amply documented in Van Straten 1995; cf. idem 2005). In a massive  study J. Gebauer, Pompe und Thysia. Attische Tieropferdarstellungen auf schwarz- und  rotfigurigen Vasen (Münster 2002), treats much the same issues (“In the end, hold  on to your copy of van Straten’s Hiera kala, but do not hesitate to get Gebauer’s  Pompe and Thysia as well”: G. Ekroth, Kernos 19 [2006] 478). However, Peirce does  not take sides with the Paris-Lausanne school either, which she censures for applying  a similar type of structural reading of the ritual including the comparable limitations  of that procedure. For a balanced assessment of the two positions in the current dis- cussion on the question “ritual murder or dinner party?” see: Thomassen 2004. See  also: Pirenne-Delforge 2008, Ch. 4, ‘La pratique sacrificielle’. Most recent on Burkert’s  sacrificial theory: A. Bierl &amp; W. Braungart (edd.), Gewalt und Opfer: im Dialog mit  Walter  Burkert (Berlin – New York 2010). 16 Vernant 1980, 98: “Les dieux grecs sont des puissances non des personnes” an  expression that returns passim in his work. Price 1999, 57: “The anthropomorphism of  Greek cult statues does not mean that the Greeks thought that their gods actually were  people” is a variation on Vernant’s words, to whom he refers. He modifies the gen- eralizing, ontological and in a way philosophical statement of Vernant into a subjec- tive perspective of viewing, considering and identifying. Even so, in this generic form  his statement is untenable. As I have argued time and again in the present book we  should rather allow for multiple options and momentary choices, the latter induced  </page> <page sequence="7">  a god: why is hermes hungry? 315 Vernant illustrates his point with a note on the god who is the subject  of the present chapter: The study of a god such as Hermes, who is a very complex figure, must  first define his relation to Zeus in order to pick out what it is in particu- lar that Hermes contributes to the wielding of sovereign power, and then  compare him with Apollo, Hestia, Dionysos and Aphrodite. Hermes has  affinities with all of these gods but is distinguished from each of them by  certain modes of action which are peculiar to him.17 He himself has complied with his own prescription in his brilliant— though not entirely incontrovertible—essay on Hermes and Hestia.18 Burkert’s pantheon looks totally different, as we discussed in the first  chapter. As to individual gods, he contends that each god is defined  by a number of characteristics, dependent on variations in time and  place. These characteristics themselves are variables associated in an  opaque and seemingly arbitrary shift with a great number of other  gods. Burkert’s main interest is in principles of origins-evolution on  the one hand and functionalistic and ritualistic social aspects of each  individual god on the other. by specific circumstances, as for instance standing in front of an anthropomorphic  cult statue. Gordon 1979=1996, adduced by Price for his point of view, in fact repre- sents a far more nuanced position. E.g. p. 20: “Religion then can be seen as a way of  naming powers, and, by the act of classification, asserting and denying relationships  between ‘aspects’ of powers (. . . .) It is a simple step to represent the powers as people,  on condition that one ‘reserves’ the classification—they are people, but they are also  not.” Ibid. p. 25 (on statues and pictures of gods): “As representations, statues and  pictures of gods indeed represent them. They are true illusions, pictures of a world  we cannot know.”  17 Vernant 1980, 99 f. 18 Vernant 1971, I, 124–170, translated as: Hestia-Hermes: The religious expres- sion of space and movement among the Greeks, Social Science Information 8 (1969)  131–168. To define Hermes as the principle of movement is of course acceptable from  a mythological point of view but very difficult to reconcile with Hermes’ ubiquitous  visual image as a herm. The Greeks already loved to play with this inconsistency. Anth.  Pal. XVI 186 introduces Hermes boasting that he is the swift god: “So do not place  my statue devoid of hands and feet in the palaistra of all places! How can I be swift or  how move my hands if you place me on a basis without these two?” A fine pun on this  double reality of Hermes in Ar. Plut. 1097 ff., where the ‘real’ god Hermes wants a job  and volunteers to serve as herm at the door: παρὰ τὴν θύραν στροφαῖον ἱδρύσασθέ με  (1153). Kassel 1983, 11 n. 51 discovers the same ambiguity in Anth.Pal VI 334,3 καὶ  σɞ τετραγλώχιν, μηλοσσόε, Μαιάδος Ἑρμᾶ, “wo mit Bedacht zwei Epitheta nebenein- ander gesetzt sind, von denen eines der Herme, eines dem in lebendiger Wirksamkeit  gedachten Gott gilt.” I am not so sure here: there are several epigrams in the Anth.  Pal. where it is the—speaking—herm itself/himself which/who explicitly boasts the  protection of the herd. Cf. Anth. Pal. XVI 190. </page> <page sequence="8"> 316 chapter four The two rival schools of course do share the general acknowledgement  that Hermes is characterized by a series of well-known functions and  typical traits: herdsman, traveller, trader, thief, cheat, magician, mes- senger, interpreter, psychopompos.19 Together these features can be  and often have been explained as different facets of one more com- prehensive concept. There seems to be a general consensus on ‘trans- gression of boundaries’ as a common denominator, but depending on  scholars’ interests, either in meaning or in origin/function, the notions  and images in which this transgression is assumed to find its expres- sion differ dramatically. Structuralistic or semiotic interpretations tend  to focus on principles, as for instance: ‘the principle of movement’ or  ‘the ambiguous’, or ‘the communication between different realms or  worlds’,20 while those interested in a ritualist, social or evolutionary  approach may read Hermes as a prototypical ‘initiand’21—hence view- ing the central issue of the hymn as related to modern Greek rituals  of ‘making friends’ through cunning practices of cattle raiding22—, a  19 Systematic collections of characteristics of individual gods are already know from  antiquity. Artemidorus 2.37, for instance, provides the following picture of Hermes  (if seen in a dream): “Hermes is good for those who are studying oratory, for athletes,  for gymnastic instructors, for all those whose life is devoted to trade and commerce,  and for inspectors of weights and measures, since all these men regard him as their  tutelary deity. He is also good for those who wish to travel abroad. For we picture him  as being winged. But for other men, he foretells unrest and disturbances. He portends  death for the sick because he is believed to be the conductor of souls.” 20 Fundamentally on the whole complex of transgression, movement, ambiguity:  Vernant in his Hermes-Hestia study in Vernant 1971; Kahn 1978; eadem, Hermès,  la frontière et l’identité ambiguë, Ktema 4 (1979) 201–211. Cf. Osborne 1985: 53:  “Hermes is necessarily in-between, a bird of passage, a communicator.” Cf. recently  Jaillard 2007, who understands Hermes as “la puissance souveraine de l’espace inter- médiaire des passages. Dans le jeu polythéiste, une telle puissance est susceptible d’agir  en tout lieu où une liaison est nécessaire.” 21 So G. Costa, Hermes dio delle iniziazioni, CCC 3 (1982) 277–285; Burkert 1984,  espec. 843 ff.; Haft 1996; F. Majorel, Hermès ou le mouvement spiralé de l’initiation,  BAGB (2003) 53–81; Johnston 2002 and 2003: Hermes is the guide of youngsters  during their maturation rites and hence the god of athletic contests, the later Her- maia.

We have thousands of votive inscriptions,  prayers, cult representations transmitted in verbal or visual form, as  well as other expressions of personal devotion. Yet the quests for ori- gin, function or meaning—even if, or rather because they are so intel- lectually rewarding—risk making us forget that religion just may imply  personal engagement. It is my unfashionable impression that in every- day religious practice individual Greek gods were practically never  conceived of as powers, let alone as cultural products, but were in the  first place envisaged as persons with individual characters and person- alities. However great the impact that local peculiarities may have had  on the perceptions of the believers,26 the mention of a divine name or  observing a picture or a statue would evoke a broad, universal image, a  set of connotations which, despite all incisive local differences, is typi- cal of that specific god, pervading both myth and ritual. This personal  mental description (French ‘signalement’) is perspicuous, even if the  god is considered in isolation. His/her image or personality is neither  necessarily nor exclusively dependent on that of other gods, although  of course divine ways of interaction, opposition or relationship may  present helpful instruments for closer d etermination. In my view a  god’s image is very much inspired by his ‘Sitz im Leben’, his place in  human life and experience. 23 K. Kerényi, Hermes der Seelenführer (Zürich 1944); Burkert 1984, 841 ff. Several  authors who compare Hermes with Odysseus (below n. 184) do so with respect to  their ‘trickster’ nature.  24 Not only in the sense of messenger, but also—or predominantly so—in that of  sacrificial assistant in slaughtering the animals and cutting the meat, as in Od. 15.319– 323; Athen. 160a: L.R. Farnell, The Cults of the Greek States V (Oxford 1909) 36; Allan,  Halliday &amp; Sikes, The Homeric Hymns (Oxford 1936) 306; Furley 1981, 38–63; idem  1996, 19; Burkert 1984, 840. Jaillard 2007, Ch. II.2: ‘Manières hermaïques de rendre  possible le sacrifice’, highlights Hermes as the one who provides, prepares and pro- motes the (material) conditions for the sacrificial act. On the sacrificial function of  (Hermes as) the kerux see: ibid. 158–161, with literature in n. 126. 25 Bremmer GR 21: “the god of the thieves, merchants, and ephebes, in short of  socially marginal groups.” 26 As argued in extenso in Ch. 1. Sineux 2006, 55–58, is a good illustration of the  tension inherent in attempts to validate both positions: gods as persons and/or gods  as powers.  </page> <page sequence="10"> 318 chapter four I now hope to illustrate this by a discussion of the “most philanthropic  among the gods,”27 Hermes. Although the literary (Hymn to Hermes),  the archaeological (herms, vase paintings) and the cultic/ritual (her- maic aspects of sacrifice) forms of expression have attracted consid- erable attention in recent years, it has never been fully realized how  revealingly all these different components supplemented and indeed  informed each other, co-operating in the construction of a recogniz- able image of the god, pervasive and consistent over a long period of  time. For, if, in the first Chapter, I have argued that one god always  participates in various different systems, but never simultaneously in  all of them, this was not intended to mean that the systems did not  mutually inform each other. They did, but selectively and in special  circumstances only.  If for Vernant Hermes is ‘good to think’ and for Burkert ‘good to  function’, I would like for once to trace the god whom Greeks or the  Greeks found ‘good to live by’ (or ‘live with’), the μεμφόμενον Ἑρμίδιον  as Aristophanes Pax 922 calls him: “wretched little Hermes,”28 despised  and overlooked by big-game hunters. A quick survey of the hymn will  set the tone and put us on the track of a feature that in my view is the  most typical of the god: his thoroughly human nature. No god—as  a god—has been more humanized and indeed more de-deified than  Hermes on his ascendance towards a deserved place on the Olympus.  In an attempt to grasp the god as an individual person and to compose  a ‘psychogram’ with the aid of various streams of evidence, it is this  particular aspect that I will further analyse, drawing on the informa- tion provided by respectively the literary genre of the fable, next visual  representations, then comedy specializing in Hermes’ culinary pecu- liarities, which—via a glance into other sources on sacrificial cultic  aspects—will guide us back to hungry Hermes. With this chapter we are leaving the central theme that intercon- nected the first three chapters—‘the systematics’ of the divine world— and enter that of the last three chapters, which are concerned with the  27 Ar. Pax 392. Hermes is the god most frequently addressed with terms such as  φίλος, φίλανδρος, φιλάνθρωπος: Hippon. fr. 24a D; Aesch. Ag. 515; Ar. Pax 393, 602;  Plut. 1134; Nub. 1478. See: W.F. Otto, Die Götter der Griechen (Frankfurt 1947) 105 ff. 28 If this is the correct meaning. Since this form never occurs in a passive sense the  meaning ‘grumbling’ (at the meagreness of the offering) has also been proposed.

Hermes: The Human God in the Hymn The hymn, which on linguistic and other grounds has been claimed  for Athens, Boeotia or Arcadia, and which is to be dated to the late  6th century BC,29 opens with the birth of the god.30 His exploits dur- ing the first day of his life will, throughout the first part of the hymn,  continuously oscillate between scenes of babyhood and adolescence,  which both carry definitely human connotations. Indeed, this common denominator in the consistent emphasis on  the anthropomorphic aspects of the god and his activities has not  escaped attention. It is deployed by Kahn to underpin the ambigu- ous nature of her god, by those who see Hermes as a prototypical  ephebe in a transitional period, by Clay to elucidate the ‘Werdegang’  of her god as a reflection of “his anomalous position: not a mortal,  but not yet fully a god”31 and—more implicitly—by those who have  u nderstood the hymn as a satirical or comical parody.32 I will present  some of the most relevant passages. 29 Attica or Boeotia are the most likely places of origin. The traditional date round  600 BC must be abandoned on linguistic and lexicographical grounds: H. Görge- manns, Rhetorik und Poetik im homerischen Hermes-hymnus, in: H. Görgemanns &amp;  E.A. Schmidt (edd.), Studien zum antiken Epos (Meisenheim 1978) 113–128; Janko  1982, 140–143, who at 149 regards: “the close decades of the sixth century as the era of  the poem’s creation.” As for the supposed occasions of its performance Johnston 2002  and 2003 attractively suggests festivals of Hermes that encouraged or celebrated the  maturation of males which she identifies as the athletic Hermaia. See 2003, 171–174  for a list of possible locales where the hymn could have been performed. 30 On the places in Greece to which the birth is assigned in various sources see: Clay  1989, 103. On the birth of Hermes in the hymn and literary testimonia of its place in  Arcadia, see: Jost 1985, 441–444. 31 Clay 1989, 109 and passim as elements of an account of how the new-born Hermes  won his place and his timai amongst the divine society at the Olympus. Ibid. 96: “The  timai of all others have been divided and distributed. Nothing remains for Hermes,  who is thus obliged to acquire his honors by theft or exchange.” Cf. already more than  a century ago, A. Gemoll, Die homerischen Hymnen (Leipzig 1886) 184, who claimed  that it is all about how the newborn Hermes won recognition as a powerful god on  Olympus. E.S. Greene, Revising Illegitimacy: The Use of Epithets in the Homeric  Hymn to Hermes, CQ 55 (2005) 343–349, shows how his rise to an Olympian status  is alluded to in his epithets throughout the hymn. It is this Werdegang of the god that  has received a new and even more consistent treatment by Jaillard 2007.  32 On the comic aspects of the hymn: K. Bielohlawek, Komische Motive in der  homerischen Gestaltung des griechischen Göttermythus, ARW 28 (1930) 203–209.  </page> <page sequence="12"> 320 chapter four After having fabricated the lyre Hermes sings a song (55–60) of how  Hermes was borne as the son of Zeus and the nymph Maia, “a kind of  ‘Hymn to Hermes’ ” (Clay 1989, 108). A god as rhapsode of his own  infancy is surprising and the poet does not fail to focus our atten- tion to this strange reversal by ‘italicizing’ the peculiarity: “telling all  the glorious tale of his own begetting” (ȑν τ’ αὐτο˃ γενεήν).33 Very  human-focussed all this, both in subject and in context. The poet typi- fies this performance as “an improvisation: sweet random snatches, as  youths bandy taunts at festivals.” Perhaps we may see it as an allusion  to the burlesque nature of the hymn itself. At any rate it is a clear  characterization of the god as ephebe. Later, in the ‘Olympian’ part  of the Hymn (425 ff.), his second song concerns loftier issues: “the  story of the deathless gods and of the dark earth, how at the first they  came to be, and how each one received his portion” (ὡς τὰ πρῶτα  γένοντο καὶ ὡς λάχε μοῖραν ἕκαστος). First he sang of Mnemosyne,  then Zeus and next “the rest of the immortals according to their order  in age, and told how each was born, mentioning all in order” (ὡς  γεγάασιν ἕκαστος . . . . πάντ’ ἐνέπων κατὰ κόσμον). To sing the birth  and life of gods in a very Hesiodic fashion34 is the task par excellence of  human bards.35 Altogether Hermes’ self-praise represents a straight reversal of divine  and human qualities. The whole ambiguity is mirrored in the alarm- 33 Clay 1989, 109: “Normally, of course, the mortal hymn-poet praises and celebrates  a god, but here we have a god—whose precise status is still ambiguous—praising him- self.” Cf. also H.Apollo 158–75. It is grossly misunderstanding the whole purport of  this passage to eliminate this text as a later insertion as Humbert does.  34 Note that, using the very same terms, Herodotus 2.53 tells us what the poets  Homer and Hesiod had done: “But it was only—if I may so put it—the day before  yesterday that the Greeks came to know the origin and form of the various gods,  and whether or not all of them had always existed. (ȷθεν δὲ ἐγένοντο ἕκαστος τῶν  θεῶν, εἴτε αἰεὶ Ȓσαν πάντες, ὁκοῖοί τε τινες τὰ εἴδεα, οὐκ Ȍπιστέατο). For Homer and  Hesiod (. . . .) were the ones who composed for the Greeks the theogonies and who  gave the gods their appropriate titles, powers and offices, also describing them by  their appearance” (οȿτοι δέ εἰσι οἱ ποιήσαντες θεογονίην ȋλλησι καὶ τοῖσι θεοῖσι τὰς  ἐπωνυμίας δόντες καὶ τιμάς τε καὶ τέχνας διελόντες καὶ εἴδεα αὐτῶν σημήναντες). 35 There are divine singers, but they belong at the court of the Olympians. There it  is, of course, the specific task of the Muses, who are the instructors of human bards  (H.Muses and Apollo 3; H.Artemis 18 ff.; H.Helios 17 f.; H.Selene 19 f.) and are hence  in a stereotyped formula invoked to tell what the bards are going to tell. Clay 1989,  138, interprets the singing of the Theogony as Hermes’ job to sing the ordered cosmos  culminating in the final event of his own birth, 139: “Hermes is the first to be able to  sing a theogony, because only with his birth is the configuration of the divine cosmos  complete.”  </page> <page sequence="13">  a god: why is hermes hungry? 321 ingly inconsistent description of the grotto: in the first hymn sung by  Hermes it is described as “bright home, with tripods all over the house  and the abundant cauldrons,” as suits a hymn about a nymph as sung  by a mortal bard. Quite at odds with the lowly dwelling pictured in  later passages, describing Hermes own adventures, as sung by the god  Hermes on his way towards Olympus. So different indeed that the  various descriptions have been taken as evidence for multiple author- ship, not surprisingly, but very erroneously.36 In the meantime Hermes has been pondering another ungodly act  (62–67), one that concerns a basic marker of the condition humaine  and one that, according to the poet, could only be achieved through  “sheer trickery, deeds such as knavish folk pursue in the dark night  time.” As we have seen Hermes is now “hankering after meat”  (κρειῶν ἐρατίζων, 64), a desire incongruous with divine or infant  behaviour. The very same desire is re-evoked in similar terms in ll.  130–133, where, albeit a god, Hermes is tormented by the sweet savour  (ὀδμή) of the roasted meat, but does not give in. Here as elsewhere in  the hymn he ‘plays’ the role of man, more especially of an adolescent.37  Accordingly, the whole aprosdokêton is associated with an unholy  preparatory action: the theft of cattle, both grandiose and primordial.  From now on the tale is located in a distinctly human world,38 as is  36 Lit. in Clay 1989, 110 n. 48, who herself thinks “depending on the circumstances,  Hermes may glorify the cave, as here, or denigrate it, as he does later.” More explicit  Johnston 2003, 158. 37 As, again explicitly, he does in ll. 134–136, where he “put away the fat and all  the meat, and set it up high as a token of his recent theft.” These three passages belong  closely together and, pace Jaillard, together undeniably and no doubt intentionally  evoke the behaviour of a distinctly human adolescent.  38 Even if Apollo’s cattle are immortal and feed on unmown—that is sacred— meadows. Some commentators do not allow ambrotoi its full force. Vernant and Kahn  do (see Clay 113 n. 61), but the facts as recorded in the hymn prove that the cows are  not immortal. Again we are in an ambiguous strait, where Hermes, despite his divin- ity acting like a human, kills (hence ‘mortalizes’) cattle which by nature are immortal.  Reversal all over the place. Vernant, Kahn (50) and Burkert 1984, 842 argue that by  removing them from the divine sphere their domestication will simultaneously intro- duce them into the realm of men and mortality, and cf. now the astute discussion by  Jaillard 2007, 137–143. Cl. Leduc, “Le pseudo-sacrifice d’Hermès.” Hymne homérique  à Hermès I, vers 112–142. Poésie rituelle, théologie et histoire, Kernos 18 (2005) 141– 165, argues that the cattle play a part in the invention of exchange (and that Hermes  is fire!

Whatever the  meaning or the ritual references, the actor Hermes is pictured in a fully  human perspective throughout the scene,40 right till the moment that  he decides not to consume the meat. There is an emphatic reminder of  his divine nature (“though an immortal god”), but applied to underline  his thoroughly human behaviour in craving flesh. This passage marks  the most explicit and revealing moment of the deliberately shaky bal- ance between the divine and the human personalities of god Hermes.  As a human being Hermes craved the meat;41 as a god, he could not  eat it without betraying—that is: losing—his divine status.42 So far we have not mentioned one curious expression designating  the object of Hermes’ appetite: ὁσίη κρεάων (130). Though marked  by a variety of meanings dependent on its context, when that con- 39 He is the only human being to play a rôle in the hymn. In this respect the Hymn  to Hermes is unique. See: Clay 1989, 115. On the provenance of this story: D. Mal- colm, Unhelpful Helpers: Folk-tale Vestiges in the Homeric Hymns, Prometheus 32  (2006) 194–207. On the special nature of Hermes’ address to him: Y.Z. Tzifopoulos,  Hermes and Apollo at Onchestos in the Homeric Hymn to Hermes: The Poetics and  Performance of Proverbial Communication, Mnemosyne 53 (2000) 148–163, revealing  another expertise of the god: his mastery in manipulating and controlling proverbial  wisdom: “he is not only a trickster in deeds, but also in words, because Hermes loves  to talk and is good at it” (163).  40 L. Radermacher, Der homerische Hermeshymnus (Wien-Leipzig 1931) 99: “Keine  Andeutung spricht dafür, dass H. dem Dichter etwas anderes war als ein Opfernder.”  This finds support in the conclusion of N. Himmelmann, Tieropfer in der griechis- chen Kunst (Nordrhein-Wesfälische Ak. Wiss. Geistesw. Vortr. G.349 [1997]) 52, that  “Götter selbst zahme Tiere nicht töten (können).” 41 Note that the earliest versions of the myth do not mention this craving for meat  (see Johnston 2003, n. 6), which is probably an invention of the author of the hymn.  42 Scholars of divergent denominations agree on this reason for Hermes’ inhibition.  “Can it be that by eating he would have forfeited the position he claimed as one of  the Twelve Gods?” thus H.G. Evelyn-White (following Gemoll) in the Loeb edition  of 1914. H. Jeanmaire, Le substantif ὁσία et sa signification comme terme technique  dans le vocabulaire religieux, REG 58 (1945) 66–89, espec. 80: “c’est en sa qualité de  dieu qu’Hermès (. . .) se voit interdire d’en [i.e. de la viande sacrificielle] jouir en le  dégustant effectivement.” J.-P. Vernant in: Detienne &amp; Vernant 1979, 242: “Hermès se  garde de manger les viandes qu’il a préparées. S’il goûtait, il deviendrait un homme.”  Burkert 1984, 837 f., in accordance with his theory of the ritual background of the  whole scene is forced to look for a different meaning. Likewise, though from a totally  different perspective, Jaillard 2007 must downplay any suggestion of the god’s human  nature. Below we will discuss circumstances in which gods are assumed to partake of  human food including meat. This, however, is always in a context of official Olympian  sacrifice.  </page> <page sequence="15">  a god: why is hermes hungry? 323 text is a sacrificial ceremony the term ὅσιος most probably refers to  food, especially meat, that after all obligations to the gods have been  fulfilled, is now released for human consumption. This was and still  is the opinion of a number of scholars, most of them belonging to an  earlier generation. They agree that ὁσίη is “that which the divine law  concedes to men.”43 If true, this would imply that Hermes, besides  craving a human meal, also refers to it with a term typically in use for  the ‘human’s portion’ of the sacrificial meat. Accordingly Benveniste  and Kahn,44 among others, argue that Hermes misuses the term by  speaking as a mortal rather than as a god. Recent years, however, have witnessed several attempts at a more  encompassing and general definition of the concepts covered by ὅσιος  and especially of the substantive ὁσίη. For the Homeric Hymns in  particular some consensus seems to have grown round the notion:  (divine) privilege or τιμή.45 In the context of the Hymn, at first sight  43 Burkert 1985, 270, on this passage: “Here hosios designates the desacralization  of sacralization;” idem 1984, 838; “si tratta della disponibilità della carne per la con- sumazione normale dopo il compimento dei riti sacri,” with earlier literature in n. 19.  He compares it to Latin profanare, on which see: H. Wagenvoort, Profanus, profanare,  Mnemosyne IV ser. 2 (1949) 319–332 = idem, Pietas. Selected Studies in Roman Reli- gion (Leiden 1980) 25–38. Similarly Jeanmaire o.c. above (n. 42) and cf. next note. 44 E. Benveniste, Le vocabulaire des institutions indo-européennes vol. 2 (Paris 1969)  201; Kahn 1978, 68–71; and see preceding note. 45 So especially: Gh. Jay-Robert, Essai d’interprétation du sens du substantif hosiê  dans l’Odyssée et dans les hymnes homériques, REA 101 (1999) 5–20, with an extensive  discussion of previous theories. In the Hymn to Hermes 172 f.: “As for privilege, I  am going to enter on my rights, the same as Apollo” (ἀμφὶ δὲ τιμῆς, κἀγὼ τῆς ὁσίης  ἐπιβήσομαι ȓς περ ʠΑπόλλων) play a dominant role (cf. Jaillard 2007, 86–91). For later  notions of the terms, especially as compared to hieros see the balanced discussion  in W.R. Connor, “Sacred” and “Secular.” ȥερὰ καὶ ὅσια and the Classical Athenian  Concept of State, Anc.Soc. 19 (1988) 161–188, and above all J.H. Blok, Deme Accounts  and the Meaning of hosios Money in Fifth-Century Athens, Mnemosyne 63 (2010)  61–93, and eadem, A Covenant between Gods and Men: hiera kai hosia and the Greek  polis, in: C. Rapp (ed.), City—Empire—Christendom: Changing Context of Power and  Identity in Antiquity (Cambridge-New York, forthcoming 2011), who argues that the  reading of hosios as ‘desacralized’ (i.e., after consecration to the gods returned to the  human sphere) ultimately derives from the assumption that hosios can mean ‘secular,  profane’, notably attested in its application to money. Her analysis reveals, however,  that hosios money is human property to be used in a way in accordance with hosiê  and hence pleasing to the gods. Hosiê, as she argues in the second article mentioned,  indicates a set of norms of human conduct safeguarded by the gods which may apply  in particular to human obligations to the gods; hosios and cognates refer to ( creating)  a condition that is in accordance with hosiê. Application of hosiê and cognates to  gods is extremely exceptional, revealing conscious deviation of normal usage that can  be explained by its rhetorical or literary context. In other words, hosios refers as a  rule to the human position vis-à-vis the gods, not the other way round. As could be  </page> <page sequence="16"> 324 chapter four this might imply that young Hermes wished to have his share of the  privilege of the gods that consisted of roasted meat, as for instance in  the form of trapezomata presented to the gods after the sacrifice.46 This  interpretation, however, is not compatible with the author’s emphatic  clue that being a god Hermes should not hanker after roasted meat.  The expression καὶ ἀθάνατόν περ ἐόντα would be totally out of order  if the gods indeed do appear to fancy a bite of roasted beef. On the  other hand, if Hermes, albeit a god, should crave the meat released for  human consumption thus jeopardizing his divine nature, this would  be at odds with the fact that he did offer the portions of meat to the  twelve gods. It is impossible to determine with certainty what the ‘author’ may  have ‘intended’ with our passage. Either of the two interpretations runs  up against intractable inconsistencies. It is hard to avoid the impres- sion that here we find a confirmation of West’s severe verdict:47 The Hymn to Hermes (. . .) is the most untraditional in its language,  with many late words and expressions, and many used in slapdash and  inaccurate ways; and it is the most incompetent in construction, with  many narrative inconsistencies and redundancies and no command of  the even tempo appropriate to epic storytelling. However, adherents of the “save the author” school introduced in  our second chapter, who would rather bite their tongue then admit a  blunder of their author, may also prefer to adopt the following con- clusion. This conclusion is that with the scene under discussion we  have arrived at the core of the whole dilemma. The Hymn constantly  pictures Hermes as uniting two natures, that of the god and that of the  mortal. Throughout the Hymn the author plays with this ambivalence,  but his play is a precarious one. Blending a mortal and an immor- tal nature in one character must end up in inconsistencies. Whether  the resulting dissonance in the present scene originated as an inten- tional element of the author’s narrative strategy or as an unconscious  inaccuracy in the end is immaterial. The inconsistency is there and as  expected, Jaillard 2007, 107 f. rejects the meaning: “la part de viandes dont les hom- mes peuvent librement disposer” and prefers “la part qui, dans le sacrifice, constitue  la timé des dieux.” 46 This interpretation, as suggested by Jaillard 2007, would, however, reduce the  provider of the gift to the human category, whereas the identification of the meat  offering as a dais (Clay) might save Hermes’ divine status.  47 M.L. West, Homeric Hymns. Homeric Apocrypha. Lives of Homer (Loeb 2003) 12.  </page> <page sequence="17">  a god: why is hermes hungry? 325 such testifies to a central theme of the Hymn: Hermes god and man,  including the tensions inherent in such an impossible alliance. This  is an ambivalence that the author never stops calling to mind, as for  example a few verses later where it is said that during his stealthy jour- ney back home—that is back to the grotto where he was born—he was  not seen by any of gods and men. There is no other Homeric hymn in  which the expression “gods and men”48 occurs so frequently. After all this, the god re-assumes his role as a baby, this time indeed  a role in the true sense of the word, because he uses it both as a cover  for hiding and as evidence for his defence, i.e. in order to prove his  innocence. From this moment on the spotlight turns towards the  world of the gods. Hermes now (166–181) sets out for the position  that he deserves in the society of the gods.49 But even here he c annot  conceal the human aspects of his nature. He is looking forward to  enjoying utopian miracles moulded inter alia in terms of food, but  once more the types of food do not suit the fashion of Olympos.  Two of the three terms indicating the coveted abundance of divine  life—πλούσιος, ἀφνειός—have strong associations with corn in archaic  poetry, the third—πολυλήιος—literally means “with rich corn-fields.”50  Where, first, he “was greedy for flesh”, now he betrays an interest in  corn. Both are equally inappropriate diets for a god. Just like bloody  sacrifice, consumption of corn belongs to the basic markers of human  culture. By now the reader is firmly instilled with the suggestion that  Hermes, though unconditionally claiming divine status, is deeply  infected with all kinds of human associations in both positive and  negative respects. Time and again he inadvertently crosses the line  and ends up in the ‘wrong’ category. This ludic balancing between  divine and human worlds, so far most conspicuously evoked through  48 Not counting the Homeric epithet of Zeus, “father of gods and men.” Later his  mother prophecies that Hermes will be a great worry to mortal men and deathless  gods” (144 f.). Apollo asks whether Hermes has his lyre from a god or a mortal man  (441), adding that its sound no man nor god has ever heard (444 f.). He also promises  to love no other among the immortals, neither god nor man sprung from Zeus, than  Hermes (525 f.). Hermes’ belonging to two worlds is emphatically summarized in the  final lines (576 ff.) “He keeps company with all mortals and immortals.” 49 Clay 1989, 127: “With the sure knowledge of his divinity, Hermes’ status has  changed. But it remains anomalous: he is indeed a god, but one without timai. The  rest of the hymn will depict his acquisition of timai.” 50 Demeter’s bestowal of these central blessings on her mortal worshippers in  H.Demeter is described exactly in these terms.  </page> <page sequence="18"> 326 chapter four the medium of diet-markers, reaches its climax when the poet sud- denly concludes with a complete reversal of what we have seen so far  (243 ff ). The arguably most godly god Apollo unmasks the human  baby as a real god by detecting three closets full of nectar and ambrosia  in his grotto. Besides which he finds much gold and silver and gar- ments of the nymph, purple and silvery white, “such as are kept in the  sacred houses of the blessed gods.” Thus Hermes is exposed as a god  rather than a harmless baby. Indeed, from now on the focus is on the  divine nature of the child. Even after his full recognition as a god, however, both Apollo’s pre- diction (457) of great future kleos for Hermes and Hermes’ own claim  to kudos (477) are anomalous51 because these are typically human  terms for human achievements. Little surprise, then, that the three  timai or gera that will implement his kudos all sound a human ring.  On the one hand he will be “keeper of herds” (491–498), expressly  reconfirmed by Zeus in the final passage (568–571). This definitely  establishes his position in the space of man, as does his additional  ‘office’ revealed only at this moment, namely “to establish deeds of  barter amongst men (ἐπαμοίβια ἔργα θήσειν ἀνθρώποισι) through- out the fruitful earth” (516), including the threat of theft, which Apollo  fears. Secondly, Apollo gives him (529 ff.): a splendid staff of riches and wealth, which will keep you scatheless  accomplishing every task (decree?), whether of words and deeds that  are good (ȑ σε φύλαξει, πάντας ἐπικραίνουσ' ἄθλους [?] θεμοɞς [?]52  ἐπέων τε καὶ ἔργων τῶν ἀγαθῶν) which I claim to know through the  utterance of Zeus. Although it is given a new and unexpected function here, the kerukeion  is clearly marked by its conventional qualities (“of riches and wealth”)  as well, that is its magical power to do miraculous works. Here, then,  we have his second great privilege: the field of magic and miracles  through his magical rod. In Greece, as opposed to for instance Egypt,  magic is the work of man, not of gods. Generally, gods do not need  instruments for working miracles. Hermes is dependent upon his staff.  Thirdly, whereas the domain of serious prophecy is typically reserved  for gods and, among them, especially for Apollo, Hermes by way of  consolation prize “receives the Thriaiai” (564), a far humbler and more  51 As Kahn 1978, 159–164 has noted. Cf. Jaillard 2007, 80 ff. 52 Mss. θεούς. </page> <page sequence="19">  a god: why is hermes hungry? 327 common oracle centre, which works through the intermediation of  bees.53 And this special trick Hermes is even allowed to teach to mor- tals (565). Finally Zeus ends his catalogue of timai by singling out a  prerogative that belongs to Hermes alone of all the Olympians: the  exclusive right to penetrate into the underworld and to carry messages  to Hades. Other Olympians may not enter the realm of Hades. Hermes  may, or rather must. Is this—in the present context—because of his  human (= mortal) aspects? Very appropriately the hymn ends with the phrase: “He consorts  with all mortals and immortals (ὅ γε θνητοῖσι καὶ ἀθανάτοισι ὁμιλεῖ,  576 f.)54 A final, but most emphatic proclamation of Hermes’ lasting  position ‘in between’. In his hymn, then, Hermes pushes out frontiers in the accumula- tion of human traits in one god. Let us now see what other types of  evidence have to say. 3. Hermes: The Eternal Dupe in the Fable One of the literary genres largely ignored as a source for Greek culture  and society and not least religion is that of the “mendacious narrative  counterfeiting truth” (λόγος ψευδὴς εἰκονίζων ἀλήθειαν, Theon Pro- gymn. 3), the fable.55 The corpus56 turns out to be prolific in picturesque  53 Johnston 2003, 164 f.

Eine Einführung (Darmstadt 1993); G.-J. van  Dijk, The Function of Fables in Graeco-Roman Romance, Mnemosyne 49 (1996)  513–541; idem, ΑȢνοι, Λόγοι, Μ˃θοι: Fables in Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic Greek  Literature. With a Study of the Theory and Terminology of the Genre (Suppl. Mne- mosyne. Leiden 1997). F.R. Adrados’ momentous three volume History of the Graeco- Latin Fable (1999–2003) is easily the most exhaustive study. Albeit an indispensable  standard work for the specialist, it should not be recommended reading for the non- initiate. The fable had a strong hold on comedy, and the similarities between the two  genres are obvious: S. Schirru, La favola in Aristofane (Berlin 2009). 56 If there is some probability in attributing the hymn to the late 6th century, as we  saw, and near certainty in dating the earliest herms to the same period, as we will see  later, to hazard a chronology of the—earliest—fables is less, if at all, possible. Although  fables do occur in the archaic Greek literature (F. Lasserre, La fable en Grèce dans la  poésie archaïque, in Adrados 1984 [o.c. preceding note], 61–103), the earliest existent  collections go back to post-classical times (F.R. Adrados, Les collections de fables à  l’époque hellénistique et romaine, in: idem 1984, 137–195). Aesop, generally dated in  the 6th c. BC, is legend rather then history, and tracing back fables to this ‘author’ is  </page> <page sequence="20"> 328 chapter four vignettes which together provide a remarkably specific and consistent  characterization of the god Hermes.57 This is the more remarkable as  gods are by no means regulars in the fable. With Aphrodite (6 times),  Apollo (10), Athena (6), Demeter (3), Dionysos (2), Hera (3) and  Herakles (6) in Perry’s corpus all is said and done. More important,  however, is that unlike Hermes they rarely figure as the chief actors  themselves. Practically always their function is to witness or punish  or reward the actions of mortal protagonists. Zeus and Hermes are  the exceptions. The first is the most frequently mentioned god (37),  mostly, however, in an ‘unmarked’ position, as the ultimate divine  authority, principle of justice, often simply as a symbol of god or the  divine in general. In this impersonal rôle, very similar to the one we  have met in Chapter II, Zeus is not an alluring target for satirical puns  of allusions. Hermes, on the other hand, is not only a good second in  the frequency of his fables (21), but clearly distinguishes himself from  all other deities in two respects. First, in the majority of his fables he  is the principal character and actor, and secondly, he stands out for  the fixed characteristics of his demeanour.58 I will focus on the most  conspicuous aspects, as they are moulded in a few stereotyped sets of  a desperate enterprise (M.L. West, The Ascription of Fables to Aesop in Archaic and  Classical Greece, in: Adrados ibid. 105–136). Yet it can hardly be doubted that many  of the fables that we will discuss may go back to the classical period. However, even  those which originated in a later period may be considered to be at least illustrative,  since other types of evidence reveal a remarkable continuity in the ‘sociogram’ of the  god Hermes throughout antiquity.  57 I adopt the numbering of B.E. Perry, Babrius and Phaedrus (Loeb 1965) since,  in addition to his edition of the metrical fables of Babrius and Phaedrus, he provides  a survey of all ancient fables in their different forms. So does Laura Gibbs in her  very useful Aesop’s Fables. A new translation (Oxford 2002), whose introduction was  the first that provides a brief history of the different collections and versions of the  fable understandable to the non-initiate such as the present author. Her index is more  comprehensive than Perry’s and I refer to this index for the testimonia about the  other gods as mentioned in the text. References to fables are henceforth organized as  follows: Babrios, Phaedrus and Appendix Perottina refer to the numbers of the fables  as edited in Greek and English translation by Perry. P. refers to the numbers in the  survey of all other fables in his edition. H. refers to Halm’s edition. 58 In the text only the directly relevant fables are quoted. Others have no bearing on  our present theme, as for instance P. 173 = H. 308: Hermes and the wood-cutter (H.  as giver of good fortune); P. 179 = H. 329 and P. 103 = H. 138: Hermes as messenger  of Zeus; P. 323 = H. 205: A raven was caught in a snare and promised Apollo that if  he could get free he would offer some frankincense to him. But when his wish was  granted he forgot his vow. Later the same happened but now he promised a sacrifice  to Hermes. But Hermes replied: “Oh wretched raven, how can I trust you, who have  disavowed your first master and cheated him?” In a few other fables Hermes is only  mentioned en passant.  </page> <page sequence="21">  a god: why is hermes hungry? 329 representations. These recurrent traits are, first, that he is the only god  who is consistently presented in (mildly) burlesque or even ludicrous  roles, and, secondly, that he is emphatically depicted as socializing  with mortals in a definitely human fashion. 1. Burlesques One of the major themes in this category consists of allusions to  Hermes’ existence as a statue—sometimes in the form of a herm—,  which is good for five ludicrous fables, which I present here, some- times in summarized versions: 1) A man had a wooden statue of Hermes for sale and cried around that  “he was selling a god who would provide both goods and profits.” To  the not unreasonable question why then he wished to sell it instead of  reaping the profit for himself, the response was: “I need ready cash and  the god is never in a hurry to render his services.” (P. 99 = H. 2) 2) A craftsman had a wooden image of Hermes. Every day he poured  libations to it and offered sacrifice (θύων) but he continued to fare badly.  In a fit of anger with the god, he picked up the image by the leg and  dashed it to the ground. From it’s broken head gold poured forth. While  he was gathering this, the man said: “Hermes, you are a pig-headed fel- low and ungrateful to your friends. When I was serving you with adora- tion you gave me no help at all, and now that I have insulted you, you  have repaid me with many blessings. I did not understand the strange  kind of worship that you require” (τὴν εἰς σὲ καινὴν εὐσέβειαν οὐκ  ɶδειν). (Babrius 119)59 3) Wishing to know in how much esteem he was held by men, Hermes  took the form of a mortal man and entered the workshop of a statuary.  First he asked the price of a statue of Zeus, which was one drachme.  Next one of Hera, which was higher. Then, seeing a statue of himself  and supposing that men would consider this more valuable, since he was  the divine messenger and the god of profit, he asked “How much is this  59 We have the same fable in Aesopus 66 (H), where it is the statue of a god, not  Hermes. Very similar Anth. Pal. XVI 187, where a wooden image of Hermes, thrown  to the ground, pours forth gold and the conclusion is: “Often before a violent act  yielded profit.” More distantly related, but with the same message: Calim. Iambe 7,  whose Diegesis tells us that fishermen haul up a wooden Hermes in their nets, but,  despising it, try to split it up into firewood, then try to burn it,—all in vain,—throw it  back into the sea, only to recover it again in their nets the next day. Then they realize  that it is a god and found a cult. See: I. Petrovic, The Life Story of a Cult Statue as an  Allegory: Kallimachos’ Hermes Perpheraios, in Mylonopoulos 2010, 205–224. </page> <page sequence="22"> 330 chapter four Hermes?” “If you buy the other two,” said the statuary, “I’ll throw that  one in for free.”(P. 88 = H. 137)60 4) A sculptor was trying to sell a marble statue of Hermes. One man  wanted it for a gravestone, another wanted to set it up as an image of the  god himself (ȯς μὲν εἰς στήλην, ὁ δὲ ὡς θεὸν καθιδρύσων). In his sleep  the sculptor saw Hermes at the gate of dreams saying: “So then, my fate  is being weighed in your balances: it remains to be seen whether you  will make me a corpse or a god” (Ȏ γάρ με νεκρὸν Ȏ θεὸν σɞ ποιήσεις).  (Babrius 30) 5) By the roadside stood a square-hewn statue of Hermes, with a heap  of stones at the base. A dog came up and said: “I salute you first of all,  Hermes, but, more than that, I would anoint you. I could not think of  just passing by a god like you, especially since you are the athlete’s god.”  “I shall be grateful to you,” said Hermes, “if you do not lick off such  ointment as I have already, and do not make a muss on me. Beyond that,  pay me no respect.” (Babrius 48)61 We observe that Hermes is very much identified or at least strongly  associated with his statuesque representation,62 and that this hermaic  representation is an easy prey for cheerful mockery or even outright  maltreatment. The god as statue is depreciated, derided, or knocked  about, inter alia because he falls short of expectations. In the form of  a herm he is even scoffed at by a dog, which threatens to anoint it in a  way only Walter Burkert would acknowledge as an anointment.63 60 Furley 1996, 27 explains this as an allusion to Hermes’ appendage to the cult of  Zeus and Hera, as herms generally are places of communication with (other) gods in  scenes of prayer and sacrifice, as we shall discuss later.  61 I wonder whether this could be a pun on the proverbial expression: Ἑρμῆν μήτ'  ἀλείψʤς μήτ' ἀπαλείψʤǢ (Paroem. Gr. II 167 no. 10), said of those who under the  pretence of offering a benefice pinch rather than bestow it. An ancient commentator  explains this as based on the custom of poor people taking the oil rubbed on herms in  the public baths for their own use. For the description of the anointing of a herm by a  deisidaimon see: Theophrastos XVI 5. Cf. also the treatment of the hermaia, Hermes’  most common edibles, below p. 364 ff. A distant parallel in a vase painting shows a  ram which pinches a twig from Hermes’ altar (Van Straten 1995, pl. 23). 62 It is not by chance that the Greek proverb “Hermes is in the stone” (ἐν τˑ λίθˎ  Ἑρμῆς, Arist. Met. 1002a22; 1017b7) has chosen Hermes/herm for expressing the  intended meaning. Compare, too, the account by Apuleius Apol. 61 who had asked  a statue carver to make for him aliquod simulacrum cuiuscumque vellet dei, cui ex  more meo supplicassem, which “statue of whatever god” turned out to have become  a statuette of Mercurius/Hermes. Here, however, the situation is perhaps more com- plicated: V.J.Chr. Hunink, Apuleius Madaurensis, Pro se de magia, II (Amsterdam  1997) ad loc. 63 (Provocative) urinating on (or near) statues was a popular branch of sports. In  Ar. Vesp. 389 ff. Philokleon prays the hero Lykos to help him and promises never to  piss against his railings again. Such maltreatment was not appreciated by the intended  </page> <page sequence="23">  a god: why is hermes hungry? 331 Another thematic target for derision is Hermes’ failure in his role of  dispenser of gifts or qualities, positive or negative, which Zeus had  decided to bestow on humanity. Though it is his task to distribute  equal portions, as we discovered in the sacrificial scene in the hymn,  he is not really very good at it. Nor does he always emerge as the lucki- est party himself. There are three instances working variations on the  theme that Hermes is supposed to distribute ‘equal portions’ among  mankind but for some reason fails in his mission. Two other fables  are related but of a slightly different nature. Though the mishap is not  always through a fault of his own, the stories convey an unmistakable  impression of clumsiness. The very god who is praised as bringer of  luck, falls prey to misfortune himself. 6) Zeus after having created man, entrusted Hermes with pouring some  intelligence over mankind. Hermes, making equal portions, poured for  each man his portion. Thus it happened that the men of small stature  were completely filled with the brain liquid and so became intelligent,  but tall men have less sense than others. (P. 108 = H. 150) 7) It was Hermes’ job to distribute the lies equally over the world. He  loaded them in his chariot and distributed small portions in each country  but in Arabia his car broke down and the Arabians plundered it and  took all what was left. Hence, more than any other people the Arabs are  liars and cheats. (Babrius 57. Cf. H.141) 8) Zeus charged Hermes to pour over all the artisans the poison of lies.  Hermes pulverized it and, making an equal amount for everyone, he  poured it over them. But when he got as far as the cobbler he still had  plenty of the poison left, so he just took what remained in the mortar  and poured it over him. And since then all artisans have been liars, but  most of all the cobblers. (P. 103 = H. 136) Related, but of a slightly different nature: 9) Zeus ordained that Hermes should inscribe on ostraka the faults of  men and deposit these ostraka in a little wooden box near him so that  he could do justice in each case. But the ostraka got mixed up together  and some came sooner, others later, to the hands of Zeus for him to pass  judgements on them as they deserved. (H. 126) victims: SHA Caracalla 5, damnati sunt eo tempore qui urinam in eo loco fecerunt  in quo statuae aut imagines erant principis. An emperor himself might claim exemp- tion from this rule: Nero so much contemned Dea Syria ut urina contaminaret (Suet.  Nero 56). For a collection of curses against the fouling of public places, monuments or  sanctuaries see: Versnel 1985, 258. Add: SEG 46.1157; CIRB 939; SB I 4531–4532.  </page> <page sequence="24"> 332 chapter four Finally, the god himself falls victim to a flawed distribution: 10) A traveller had vowed to offer half of everything he might find to  Hermes. He finds a wallet with almonds and dates (although he had  hoped that it would contain money), eats everything edible and gives the  rest to Hermes: “Here you have, Hermes, the payment of my vow; for I  have shared with you half of the outsides and half of the insides of what  I have found.” (P. 178 = H. 315) 2. Paying a social call As messenger of the gods and dispenser of Zeus’ gifts Hermes is natu- rally pictured as the god who is supposed to travel around the world  and associate with mortals. Already in the third fable above we saw  the god adopting a human appearance or appearing in human form.  This turns out to be a central theme in the fables on Hermes. Both  as a messenger of Zeus and on his own accord, Hermes delights in  adopting a human appearance in order to pay a social call. Not only  by appearing to them in a dream (once), but by “taking the form of  a man” as it is said or implied (thrice) and even by ‘moving in with  them’ (twice). Indeed, also in other sources there is a general emphasis  on his role as a guest, not to say a parasitos, not to say a parasite, in  human surroundings.64 It should be noted that Hermes never comes as a god, always as a  man, exposing his divine identity only at the moment of departure. So  it was, with some emphasis, already in Homer. At Il. 24.334 f. Zeus,  having decided to send Hermes to Priamos, addresses him as fol- lows: “Hermes, it is your special pleasure to seek the company of men  (ἑταιρίσσαι, lit. to make a man your companion) and you lend your  ear to whoever you wish” (Ἑρμεία, σοὶ γάρ τε μάλιστά γε φίλτατόν  ἐστιν/ ἀνδρὶ ἑταιρίσσαι, καὶ τ’ ἔκλυες ʉ κ’ἐθέλʤσθα). It is only in  the end, after having accompanied and instructed Priamos in the sem- blance of a young prince, that he reveals his divine identity. This makes  his departure necessary, for “it would be unbecoming that mortal men  welcome (as hosts) face to face an immortal god” (νεμεσσητὸν δέ κεν  64 There are more gods who visit mortals in a very personal way, especially Herakles  and Dionysos. For divine visits to humans see above Ch. I, n. 45; Jameson 1994, 47  nn. 44 f., and below n. 141. On παράσιτος and its semantic shift towards ‘parasite’  see most recently: C. Damon, Greek Parasites and Roman Patronage, HSCP 97 (1995)  181–195; Neue Pauly (2000) s.v. parasit. For Hermes as parasitos, see below n. 171.  Parasites, including Herakles, in Comedy: Wilkins 2000, 71–86.  </page> <page sequence="25">  a god: why is hermes hungry? 333 εἴη ἀθάνατον θεὸν ɋδε βροτοɞς ἀγαπαζέμεν ἄντην [Il. 24.463 f.]).  The latter word has emphasis: Hermes does pay visits to men but not  as a god. Let us keep that in mind. Here are two examples from the  fables. 11) Wishing to test the prophetic abilities of Teiresias Hermes stole his  oxen. Then, adopting the likeness of a man (ὁμοιωθεὶς ἀνθρώπˎ), he went  to live with Teiresias as a guest (ἐπεξενώθη). They went together to the  outskirts of the city to find the stolen oxen and Teiresias asked Hermes  to report anything that might seem of worthy as an omen. An eagle, fly- ing from the left to the right, was deemed irrelevant but then appeared a  black crow looking first upward towards heaven and then downward at  the earth. After Hermes had reported this observation Teiresias declared:  “Here we have it, this crow is calling heaven and earth to witness that I  shall get back my oxen . . . . . . that is: if you wish it so.” (P. 89 = H. 140).65 12) Once two women entertained Hermes (apparently in human form)  “in a mean and shabby fashion.” As he was about to leave he said: “In me  you behold a god, I will give each of you at once whatever you may wish”  (Deum videtis; tribuam vobis protinus quod quaeque optarit). Of course  their wishes are thoughtless and foolish and on being fulfilled reward  them for their uncouth behaviour. (Appendix Perottina 4) We have here the reverse of the visit of Zeus and Hermes— incognito— to Philemon and Baukis, who were rewarded for their hospitable recep- tion of Zeus and Hermes, who paid them a visit in human appearance  (above p. 42). Together these different hermaic themes in the fables mirror recur- rent features of the Hymn: first of all Hermes’ central role of d istributor,  more especially as dispenser of “equal portions.” The similarity is strik- ing, and the two literary genres—not dissimilar in their airy touch— originated in roughly the same period.66 This central characteristic of  the god may have been elaborated independently in the two literary  genres. Nor are the other, more essential, analogies due to chance.  Both hymn and fables are experiments that push out frontiers in the  65 O. &amp; R. Temple, Aesop. The Complete Fables (Penguin Books 1998) p. 85, com- ment: “There is much wit in it: beggars used to carry a chough around, hence the verb  “to chouch,” which means to collect or beg for the chouch and also “to gather”—both  referring to Hermes’ act in stealing the cattle and also as a subtle insult to Hermes by  calling him not a thief but a beggar. But also the cry of the chough in Greek would be  rendered kaph which is a form of kap, meaning retail trader, and knave or cheat. The  bird’s cry therefore served to identify Hermes to Teiresias.” 66 “Originated,” but I am well aware that we have no originals. All our texts are  literary adaptations of earlier texts. Cf. above n. 56. </page> <page sequence="26"> 334 chapter four amalgamation of divine and human features in a god’s nature. No god  is more consistently furnished with human traits than Hermes. It is  Hermes’ ‘human’ disposition and demeanour, more than anything else,  that provokes a joking relationship between the god and his human  companions, including the concomitant discourse and imagery. Both hymn and fables envisage him as clever but accident-prone,  especially in the fable as a victim of misfortune, aggression or well- deserved retaliation. Already in two famous Homeric scenes, directly  relevant to our issue, we see Hermes volunteering to be the underdog.  In Il. 21, after the great gods Ares, Aphrodite, Artemis, Hera, Apollo,  and Poseidon have come to blows, Hermes, who was not involved at  all, breaks down an aristocratic taboo by telling Leto (498 ff.): Do not be afraid Leto, that I am going to fight you. People who come  to blows with consorts of the Cloud-gathering Zeus seem to have uphill  work. No, you can boast to your heart’s content and tell the gods that  you got the better of me by brute strength. Likewise in the song of Ares and Aphrodite (Od. 8.339 ff.), when  Apollo asks his brother whether he would not join Aphrodite even in  chains, Hermes answers: Would it might be, though thrice as many bonds, bonds numberless,  should hold me fast, and all you gods and goddesses should come and  see, would I might lie by golden Aphrodite. These utterances and the mentality they display are of a well nigh  Archilochean anaideia, glaringly defying the Homeric codes of hon- our, just as many of the scenes in the hymn and the fables do.67 Pic- tured with human weaknesses, Hermes is a willing target for mockery:  people mess about with his statues and herms, without ever, on the  other hand, detracting from the friendly relationship with their god. In  many respects Hermes is pictured as a fellow creature and companion,  who may temporarily be the dupe, but who will re-emerge and survive  through ingenious manoeuvres and clever tricks. The most human of  all gods comments on the human nature of gods in general: 13) A man having witnessed a shipwreck claimed that the decrees of  the gods were unjust, for to destroy a single impious person they had  also made the innocent perish. At the same moment he was bitten by  67 This, indeed, may be counted as one strong instance of Hermes’ function as  “symbol of anti-aristocratic faction:” N.U. Brown o.c. (above n. 9), 112. </page> <page sequence="27">  a god: why is hermes hungry? 335 an ant and while trying to kill it he crushed them all. Then Hermes  appeared (another appearance) to him, and struck him with his wand  saying: “And now do you not admit that the gods judge men in the same  way you judge the ants?” (Babrios 117) So far for the moment hymn and fables. It is about time to recall that  Hermes is not only a human god, but also a hungry god, a feature that  will, as I hope to show, lead us to a better insight into the coherence  of all these human and divine aspects in one god. Hermes is a play- ful god, both humorous and somewhat whimsical. He plays with men  and—in the form of his statue—generously allows men to play with  him. Let us join the game. We shall now cast a glance at the visual  representations. 4. Hermes: The Present God in Visual Art Glancing through the volumes of LIMC (Lexicon Iconographicum  Mythologiae Classicae)—if not exhaustive, certainly the most repre- sentative collection of divine imagery68—the reader soon notes that  Hermes in visual art, particularly in the form of a herm, is as con- spicuously exceptional among the gods as he was in the hymn and  the fables, and, what is more, that the instruments to express his idio- syncrasy are analogous. Far beyond serving as a visual illustration of  what we have learned from our earlier readings, the pictures, in their  turn, provide independent information, and may receive a running  commentary from scattered pieces of literary evidence, which I shall  add wherever helpful. In the end, a specific class of images will lead us  back to our point of departure: the sacrificial scene in the hymn and  the enigma of Hermes’ hunger. For the present occasion we will focus our attention on Hermes in  his most popular image, namely the herm.69 The first thing that strikes  the eye is the overwhelming popularity of the herm, even beyond its  68 G. Siebert, Hermès, LIMC V (1990) 285–378. Further important literature:  Zanker 1965, 91–103, the best treatment of fifth-century vase material though it is  short on illustrations. On Hermes in the form of a herm see: Osborne 1985; H. Wrede,  Die antike Herme (Mainz 1986); Shapiro 1989, 126–132; Furley 1996, 13–28; Parker  1996, 80–83. Rückert 1998 offers an exhaustive treatment, albeit nearly without illus- trations. On herms in general: E. Krämer, Hermen bärtiger Götter. Klassische Vorbilder  und Formen der Rezeption (Münster 2001).  69 If I restrict myself to this particular statuesque representation of Hermes in vase  painting this is because the representations of the god ‘in living form’ (most frequently  </page> <page sequence="28"> 336 chapter four ubiquitous presence70—especially in Attica—at the thresholds of pri- vate homes and estates,71 in gardens, in the streets and market places,  at the gateways of towns, before (or in) temples72 and gymnasia, along  the side of roadways and at crossroads, at the frontiers of territories  and upon tombs, in general as markers of the boundaries of inhabited  space.73 Consequently, it is only natural that these stone pillars have  been recovered in large numbers and are lavishly represented as the  in the company of Olympian gods) are all of a mythological nature and do not provide  information on the issues discussed in the present chapter. 70 Rückert 1998 provides a full survey of their most common locations and at  pp. 42–54 a definitive corroboration of their original and lasting central function  as markers of borders and spheres of influence, as argued by Fehling, Burkert and   others. 71 M. Jameson, in: O. Murray &amp; S. Price (edd.), The Greek City from Homer to Alex- ander (Oxford 1990) 194, warns us that not all houses could accommodate or afford  a herm. However, if more modest private herms have not been recovered in large  numbers, this may also be because they may have been of wood. After all Aristophanes  Vesp. 805 says about the Hekateia that they were ubiquitous at doors and entrances.  And there was a close relationship between Hekateia and herms (below n. 166).  72 Thuc. 6.27.1 πολλοὶ καὶ ἐν ἰδίοις προθύροις καὶ ἐν ἱεροῖς is not entirely clear as  to the exact location in or in front of the temples. See Furley 1996, 13 ff.  73 I am not concerned here with the herm itself, its origin, its formal development,  or the first historical records such as the erection of herms by Hipparchos, the Eion- herm monument. etc. For relevant literature see above n. 68, above all extensively on  all these topics: Rückert 1998. On the moral maxims written on the herms of Hippar- chos see especially Osborne 1985, 56 f. On the Eion herm monument ibidem, 58–64.  I accept that the moral maxims on the Hipparchos herms and the praises on those  of the Eion monument (not to speak of the “distinctly trite epigrams” mentioned by  Furley 1996, 13) may have something to do with the herm as a typical place of com- munication, either provoked by or giving rise to its quadrangular form. However,  the primary function of the Hipparchic herms was to serve as border-, distance- and  direction-markers. I am a bit sceptical towards all too sophisticated ‘communicative’  interpretations, as the one by Osborne, which seems to me an (enticing) instance  of “mirrors, not windows” (H.G. Kippenberg, on semiotic approaches to the Gos- pels, Numen 41 [1994] 88). I tend to join Furley’s scepticism here (21 and n. 39). On  the supposed origin of the herm from the herma, pile of rocks: H. Herter, Hermes,  Ursprung und Wesen eines griechischen Gottes, RhM 119 (1976) 193–241; Burkert  1985, 156; A. Athanassakis, From the Phallic Cairn to Shepherd God and Divine Her- ald, Eranos 87 (1989) 33–49. Some recent views are more sceptical: Siebert in LIMC,  Furley 1996, 18 f., Osborne 1985, 48, Parker 1996, 82, on account of the etymological  problems (ἕρμα does not designate a heap of rocks), and since the trunk was evi- dently meant to receive inscriptions. I agree with Parker ibid. in viewing the otherwise  unexplainable phallos (and the laterals—shoulders?) as a strong argument against this  modern scepticism. “The best view may be that Hipparchos found Hermes wooden  and left him marble” (ibid. 83). Concerning the suggested functions of the herm, Fur- ley 1996, 19–20 lists the following generalizations: 1) apotropaeic (Burkert); 2) popular  monuments of democracy (Domaszweski; Crome; Aurenche, Osborne); 3) connection  with youth (Siebert); and 4) as a bridge between the divine and the human spheres  (Furley himself 21). See most recently: Rückert 1998. </page> <page sequence="29">  a god: why is hermes hungry? 337 first 90 items of the article on Hermes in LIMC.74 More significant,  however, is that these herms are also very frequently portrayed in vase  paintings,75 which at least implies that they were not taken for granted  as background noise, but served as a meaningful signal, as a marker.  The earliest of these vase paintings, like the earliest monumental herms  themselves, can be dated to the very same period to which the liter- ary evidence adduced so far belongs: late sixth century.76 All in all,  Hermes boasts pride of place among deities portrayed in vase paint- ing in the form of a statue.77 Now, in this class of portraits we descry  two r ecurrent features, traces of which we already encountered in the  literary sources. They appear to be typical of Hermes. 1. Socializing First, there is the intimate and familiar nature of the various forms of  contact with the god (LIMC nos. 141–185). Nos. 141–155 present atti- tudes and gestures expressing intimate conversations with a Hermes  statue. In these scenes we often find ephebes, as is natural for the god  74 A discussion of the archaeological material found in Athens: Zanker 1965; Furley  1996, 13–17. The material given by Pausanias is discussed by Pritchett 1998, 121–132  (with recent literature) and cf. ibid. 263–273. 75 See especially: Shapiro 1989, 126–132; G. Siebert, Un image dans l’image: le  pilier hermaïque dans la peinture de vases grecques, in: L’image et la production du  sacré. Actes du coll. de Strasbourg Jan. 1988 (1991) 103–120; Zanker 1965, espec.  91–103. Simon 1985, 308–312 has a section on the vase-scenes of worship before a  herm, and Rückert 1998, 185–220, a survey of “Formen der Hermenverehrung—Die   Vasenbilder.”  76 See for the herms: E. Harrison, The Athenian Agora XI. Archaic and Archaistic  Sculpture (1965), 129–134, Rückert 1998, 67–76: “Frühe Hermenweihungen.” For the  earliest vase-paintings see espec. Zanker 1965, 91–103; Metzger 1965, 77–91 nos. 1–6;  Shapiro 1989, 126–132. 77 On the precise status of the herm as divine statue opinions may differ. “Herms  are not, of course, identical to figures of Hermes, but they cannot escape Hermes’ asso- ciations even though they have some peculiar qualities of their own,” thus cautiously  Osborne 1985, 70 n. 31. Furley 1996, 18, is less circumspect: “The herm was simply the  cult image of Hermes.” Similarly Simon 1985, 303: “Für die Griechen dagegen war die  Herme ein Bild des Gottes.” Perhaps the best idea is following J. Mylonopoulos in his  Introduction to idem 2010, 7: “Herms or Hekataia on the roads were not permanent  cult statues, but in those moments that someone went by and addressed a prayer to  them, they were indeed temporarily functioning as a cult statue. Thus, rituals defined  cult statues and not the other way round.” I would suggest that the herm, being both  god and block of stone, by its very accessibility and its human traits becomes the place  where the god shows himself from his most human side. In my view the remarkable  and among gods unique fact that a god is consistently represented in the form of a  herm has fundamentally contributed to the formation of his ‘character’, as discussed  in the present chapter.  </page> <page sequence="30"> 338 chapter four 1 2 With kind permission of Musée d’art et d’archéologie de Laon (France).

BC) showing  two herms, toward one of which an ephebe bends over touching him  with two hands and apparently whispering something in his ear. Like- wise, a girl in 4 (no. 154, 470–460 BC) seizes the herm’s ‘shoulders’,  while bending forward as if whispering something to him.83 Herms are  78 Hermes is the ‘Enagonios’, who in the words of Pindar Ol. 6.79 is the one ȯς  ἀγῶνας ἔχει μοῖραν τ’ ἀέθλων. On Hermes Enagonios and his relationship with ephe- bes and the agonistic sphere, see: Rückert 1998, 112–139. 79 Nos. 130–130bis (c. 470 BC), twice dressed as human citizens, in many other  paintings in their natural outfit. On Satyrs in the context of herms: Rückert 1998,  211–214. Generally, the social level of the passers-by seems to be humble: nos. 160,  161 show young persons on horse-back (ephebes?), but 166, 169bis portray hunters,  162 a porter carrying an enormous sack, 163 a fisherman, 164, 165 the god Pan, 168  a pharmakos? (Cl. Bérard, RA 1982, 137–150). Paus. 8.32.4 seems to include Hermes  (and Herakles) with the two gods Apollo Aguieus and Athena Ergane among the gods  who are called ἐργάται. See: Jost 1985, index s.v. dieux ergatai; Pritchett 1998, 169.  On “Hermen im Bereich der Sklaven und Handwerker:” Rückert 1998, 214–217. Cf.  the many epigrams in the Anth. Pal. in which simple people like fishermen, peasants,  scribes, and craftsmen at their retirement dedicate their outfits and tools, often explic- itly described as worn, dirty and old to (a statue of ) Hermes. 80 On scenes of supplication as expressed by touching the herm: Rückert 1998,  207–210. For some more examples of supplicating gestures in communications with  herms see: Jaillard o.c. (below n. 123).  81 For an over-sophisticated ‘communicative’ interpretation see: Osborne 1985, 54.  More convincing, Zanker 1965, 95, who underlines the extent to which Hermes can  adapt to his worshipper: each person prays to his own Hermes; there is a Hermes of  Youth and one of old Age. Like others, he explains the scene as a prayer for erotic  love, for at the reverse side of the vase the same girl appears again: this time between  two young men.  82 Similar gestures, sometimes as expressions of adoration, in nos. 113, 144, 148.  Nos. 146, 147, 149 evoke an atmosphere of colloquial communication between man  and herm. 83 All this may have a relationship with the exceptional fact that like the Dio- nysiac mask, herms are sometimes represented frontally, catching the viewer with  his gaze. For the meaning of the frontal gaze in Dionysiac art: F. Frontisi-Ducroux,  </page> <page sequence="33">  a god: why is hermes hungry? 341 sometimes pictured with curiously human traits. “On vase paintings  they can seem so animate that one would scarcely be surprised to see  one wink,” writes Robert Parker; they sometimes express “a monstrous  vivid humanity,” as Sir John Beazley noted.84 Corresponding scenes from literary evidence unequivocally confirm  that these vivid scenes of affectionate familiarity and emotional appeal  to the amiable god are inspired by images from real life. In literature,  Hermes, significantly more than any other god, is approached with the  amicable salutation φίλε and comparable forms of personal address.  When Hipponax 32 [West] calls on his “Dear Hermes” while he is  obviously about to commit some theft, this familiarity may indeed  “seem somewhat suspect,” as Burkert 1985, 274 notes, adding that,  while to be man-loving in general would be beneath the dignity of  Zeus, this quality is left for Hermes. In Ar. Pax 392—in an admit- tedly very supplicatory, hence eminently persuasory context—the  god is addressed as “O most philanthropic and generous of the gods”  (Ɋ φιλανθρωπότατε καὶ μεγαλοδωρότατε δαιμόνων).85 We saw earlier  how Hermes in Il. 24 is pictured as the god “who likes to make a man  his companion.” And, indeed, it is in this very role of ἕταιρος that  Hermes is depicted both in the vase paintings and in literature, where  mortals approach (in the literal sense of that word) the god for advice.  Au miroir du masque, in: La cité des images: religion et société en Grèce ancienne  (Paris 1984) 146–161; F. Frontisi-Ducroux and J.P. Vernant, Figures du masque en  Grèce ancienne, Journal de Psychologie (1983) 53–69. Elsewhere, in: Les limites de  l’anthropomorphisme. Hermès et Dionysos, TR 7 (1986) 193–211, she argues that it  was the particular proximity of the two gods that necessitated an emphasis on their  divine strangeness and distinction realized by their particular “refus du corps anthro- pomorphiqe,” which I find difficult to accept. “Elegant explanation”, thus Parker,  2005, 19 (“mais l’adopte-t-il pour autant?”: thus V. Pirenne-Delforge justly suspects  his elegant way of disagreeing in Kernos 20 [2007] 426). About Hermes’ frontality:  Osborne 1985, 52 f.  84 Parker 1996, 81; J.D. Beazley, The Pan Painter (Mainz 1974) 5. 85 “Manipulative flattery pure and simple,” thus S.D. Olson, Aristophanes. Peace  (Oxford 1998), ad loc. Hermes’ assistance, like his own status, is often of a very simple  kind. In Od. 15.319 Odysseus says that by the favour of Hermes, to whom the labour  of men’s hands owes all the grace and the success that it achieves, he is good in doing  all kind of simple jobs. Hermes is perhaps referred to here as the patron of all persons  of inferior status. See A. Hoekstra in: A. Heubeck &amp; A. Hoekstra, A Commentary on  Homer’s Odyssey, vol. II (Oxford 1989) ad loc. for parallels. In Aesch. PV 942 he is  called διάκονος but this comes from the mouth of Prometheus and may be an invec- tive against the servant of the despot Zeus. However, in Ion 4 Euripides has Hermes  call himself “the gods’ servant” (δαιμόνων λάτριν) and in Ar. Plut. 1170 he is called  the “Servant god.” Cf. above n. 79. </page> <page sequence="34"> 342 chapter four In Ar. Nub. 1478 f. Strepsiades regrets having rejected the gods and  now turns to a herm, saying: O dear Hermes (Ɋ φίλ’ Ἑρμῆ), do not be angry but forgive me for my  stupidity [in following the ‘atheists’ Chairephon and Socrates]. Now  become my counsellor (σύμβουλος): shall I persecute them in a process,  or tell me whatever you want. Then he feigns to listen to the herm86 after which he says: “But this is  good advice indeed, that you tell me not to make an official charge but  immediately set fire to their houses.” All this, then, is exactly the posture of close companionship pictured  in the vase paintings and which is beautifully summarized in an epi- thet of Hermes, namely Psithuristes, the one with whom you commu- nicate in whispers. As, by the way, you do with Aphrodite Psithuros.87  In the latter case the prayers may be expected to belong in the field  of love (hence requiring some secrecy); in the case of Hermes dubi- ous wishes referring to theft or deceit may be involved, as another of  his well-known epithets (δόλιος) may imply.88 Yet, there is no need  86 Hermes as a ‘living god’ himself is represented as having just such a discussion  with a statue of Eirene, in Ar. Pax 657 ff. Here too the illusion of the speaking statue  is realized through the (literally) “hermeneutic” mediation of the one partner who  feigns to have heard the answer. On the one hand, a herm is a dumb object of stone  (below n. 102). However, as soon as a special perspective requires a herm to speak,  it turns into a ‘living god’ and ‘of course’ is able to speak. Sometimes this needs a  “Daedalic” intervention, as in a dialogue in a fragment of Plato Comicus, Fr. 188 (PCG  204) where one person asks: “Who are you, speak quickly, why do you keep silent;  don’t you speak?” whereupon another answers: “I am Hermes possessing the voice of  Daedalos; though made of wood I walk by myself and so have arrived at this place.”  In a fragment of the Comic author Phrynichos (PCG Fr. 61) Daedalos’ art is not even  required. We witness a discussion, inspired by the Hermocopidae affair, between a  person who warns a herm (Ɋ φίλταθ’ Ἑρμῆ) to take care not to stumble and smash  things up, and the Herm answering “I’ll take care” (φυλάξομαι). And so we are back  at the whispering herm in the Nubes, where at 1183 a scholion comments: ὡς το˃  Ἑρμο˃ ἀνανεύσαντος. On all this see Kassel 1983. And cf. the brilliant discussion on  the nature of statues in Gordon 1996. 87 On this epithet, the evidence and its uses, see: H. Usener, Psithyros, RhM 59  (1904) 623; G. Radke, s.v. Psithyristes and Psithyros, RE XXIII, 1414–1417. There  was a Hermes with these names in Athens as there were an Aphrodite and an Eros.  A Heros Psithyros is epigraphically attested for Lindos at Rhodos: I.Lindos II no. 484.  Cf. Versnel 1981a, 27; L. Soverini, ƚίθυρος: Eros, Aphrodite e i susurro nella Grecia  antica, in: S. Alessandri (ed.), ȥστορίη. Studi offerti dagli allievi a G. Nenci (Lecce 1994)  433–460. Good discussion in: Pirenne-Delforge 1994, 46 ff., who suggests that the  epithet may be taken as an active form: the god(dess) murmurs her/his answer. 88 Cf. Paus. 7.27.1, “On the road to Pellene (Achaia) there is an image of Hermes  by the wayside: he bears the surname of wily (δόλιος) and is ready to accomplish  the prayers of men (εὐχὰς δὲ ἀνθρώπων ἕτοιμος τελέσαι): the image is square and  </page> <page sequence="35">  a god: why is hermes hungry? 343 for being over-suspicious on this point. About a stone herm (λίθου  πεποιημένον ἄγαλμα) of Hermes Agoraios with a beard89 in the centre  of the market of Pharai in Achaia, Pausanias 7.22.2. tells us that beside  it an oracle is established: In front of the image is a hearth (ἑστία) made of stone, with bronze  lamps clamped to it with lead. He who would inquire of the god comes  at evening and burns incense on the hearth, fills the lamps with oil, lights  them, lays a coin of the country called a copper on the altar to the right  of the image, and asks his question, whatever it may be, into the ear of  the god. Then he stops his ears and leaves the market-place; and when  he is gone a little way outside, he takes his hands from his ears, and  whatever words he hears he regards as an oracle.90 This is precisely the humble type of oracle which, according to the  hymn, is appropriate for Hermes, and of course not necessarily  restricted to questions of a fishy nature. 2. More burlesques Let us turn now to the second pervasive trait in the visual represen- tations, namely the aspect of mild irony or even mockery that is as  conspicuous here as it was in the hymn and the fables. First, it may be  called to mind that the great majority of the herms are ithyphallic, some  of them ithyphallikotatoi. The city of Kyllene boasts a statue of Hermes  which was nothing but a huge penis91 and according to some scholars  bearded, and has a cap on his head.” For δόλιος as a fixed epithet of Hermes see the  evidence in Pritchett 1998, 132.  89 On this epithet and its connotations see below n. 162. 90 On these oracular and ‘speaking’ herms see: Herter 1976, 235. F. Graf, Rolling the  Dice for an Answer, in: S.I. Johnston &amp; P.T. Struck (edd.), Mantikê. Studies in Ancient  Divination (Leiden 2005) 51–97, espec. 71–78, notes “that Hermes’ oracular power is  due to his association with chance and luck rather than to any intrinsic divinatory  power,” and interestingly connects this type of oracle through ‘chance utterances’, as  at the agora of Pharai, with ‘dice oracles’ as we know them from Asia Minor, also often  at the agora and in relation to Hermes, and hence also associated with commerce. All  this is closely related to Hermes’ as personified chance or tuche. For the latter see:  Eur. Rh. 216 ff. On Hermes’ oracular faculties: Farnell IV, and V, 23; 28; 73 n. 80.

One painting 5 (no. 94, 470–460 BC)  depicts a herm with an inordinate member on which a bird alights  while at the same time kissing the god on the lips (homoerotic?),93 oth- ers display objects suspended on the phallus (no. 151, early 4th c. BC:  a round object—small vase, a sac?;94 2 (no. 155) a garland). And as to  6 (no. 130bis, c. 470 BC), I am not at all sure where the bough handed  to a herm by a satyr dressed up as a travelling citizen is going to land.  In no. 156 an acolyte of sacrifice passes by a herm and touches his  sex.95 The Hermokopidae, of course, pushed the phallic joking to its  frontiers (or beyond), at least if this was the body-part they amputated,  an option that, in my view, can hardly be doubted.96 There is yet another series of pictures in which derisive overtones  may be detected. It concerns a group of paintings (nos. 170–184) in  which herms are being manipulated and even messed around during  the process of fabrication, transport, or installation. The finest, also the  earliest herm attested on a vase, is 7 (no. 170, 520–510 BC): the well- known picture of a sculptor fabricating a herm, painted in the interior  of a cup by Epiktetos and carrying the inscription Hiparchos kalos.97  There are three later gems with similar pictures (nos. 176, 177, 178).  Other paintings (no. 171, 440–430 BC; 8 [no. 172, 480–470 BC]) show  a satyr carrying or placing—or pinching?—a herm. Most curious is the  god Hermes himself carrying a herm on a chariot drawn by four Panes  92 See on questions of origin and function of the hermaic phallos: Rückert 1998,  42–54. 93 In Callim. 7th Iambe (fr. 199) a pederast asks a herm in the Palaestra if his  ithyphallic condition may have been triggered by his love for the questioner’s own  eromenos Philetadas. A comparable emphasis on a herm’s pederastic preferences also  Anth. Pal. XII 143. 94 Not depicted in LIMC. See: Metzger 1965, 84 no. 24 pl. 30,2.  95 Is it by mere accident that two scenes of a gynaikeion (nos. 158 and 159, both mid  4th c. BC) display the singular presence of non-ithyphallic herms?  96 Ar. Lys. 1093 f.; Phrynichos Fr. 58. 97 Osborne 1985, 49. Cf. Anth. Pal. XVI 191, where a Hermes statue admits that he  is only made of clay on a potter’s wheel. A proverb displays a pun on an unfortunate  result of a failed process of fabrication: Ɖητῶν Ἑρμῆν γλύψαι κέρκοπα ἔγλυψα (“While  I set out to carve a Hermes, the final product turned out to be an ape,” Paroem. Gr.  II, p. 228 no. 4). Slightly different but with the same negative connotation the Hermes  Perpheraios in Callim. 7th Iambus (fr. 197, 2–3) modestly admits to be only a “par- ergon” of the wooden horse made by Epeios (which itself cannot possibly be proud  of its epithet φυγαίχμας!).  </page> <page sequence="39">  a god: why is hermes hungry? 347 (no. 174, an Italiotic situla).98 Last but not least, a less innocent scene:  9 (no. 179, 470–460 BC), a Satyr is standing on top of a herm which  is lying on the ground and hits his head with a double axe. While  formally it has some resemblance with well-known anodos-scenes,99 it  rather reminds me of the fable in which the splitting of the head of a  Hermes statue yielded rich profit. But neither should we rule out that  an attack of penis envy may be involved.100 In many of these pictures—there are more of the kind101—it is as if  Hermes, in the helpless form of a ‘dismembered’—hence immobile— quadrangular herm,102 is exposed as being left to the tender mercies of  humans, just as we shall see him as dependent on their good graces in  a later section. In this shape Hermes is revealed as man’s creation, in  need of man’s assistance at least as much as man is in need of his help.  No other god matches this precarious status: man-handling of statues  of gods in vase painting (and the fable) seems to be uniquely restricted  to the god of the herms.103 This consistent feature of at best an over-familiar and at worst a dis- respectful treatment of herms strikingly mirrors the playful and mock- ing scenes concerning statues of Hermes in the fables. And there are  other ironical expressions in different types of evidence. An inscrip- tion from Chios mentions the theft of an image of Hermes: 98 This vase, still unpublished, was first mentioned by K. Schauenburg, in: U. Höck- mann &amp; A. Krug (edd.), Festschrift für F. Brommer (Mainz 1976) 247 n. 3. I know of  only one (literary) parallel of such an enigmatic image: Soph. Fr. 452, where the gods  are seen leaving the city of Troy carrying their own xoana on their shoulders, knowing  that the city has been taken. 99 Cl. Bérard, Une nouvelle péliké du peintre de Géras, AntK 9 (1966) 93–100, where  he also compares it with an Attic rf. amphora ARV 647/18 of the Oinokles painter,  picturing Herakles hacking at a lying pillar. Cf. idem, Anodoi. Essai sur l’imagerie des  passages chthoniens (Neuchâtel 1974) 75–87. 100 For the comical ‘meaning’ of the sexually aroused Satyr see, besides the earlier  works of F. Lissarague, now also G. Hedreen, “I Let Go My Force Just Touching Her  Hair”: Male Sexuality in Athenian Vase-Paintings of Silens and Iambic Poetry, ClAnt  25 (2006) 277–325, who argues that it all concerns “the laughter of one made to see  himself in their behavior.” 101 Cf. in particular a Pelike in Compiegne, Metzger 1965, no. 1 Pl. 30.1: in a menac- ing gesture a Satyr holds a club before a herm.  102 We should not forget that, in the words of A. Otto, Die Sprichwörter und sprich- wörtlichen Redensarten der Griechen (Leipzig 1890) s.v. herma, “Die Herme gilt, wie  der Stein überhaupt, als Bild stupider Unthätigkeit,” referring to Juven. 8.52 and  Apoll. Sidon. ep. 4.12.3.  103 As Folkert van Straten kindly informs me. Of course mythical scenes of carrying  the palladion (or Artemis’ Taurian statue) are of a different type altogether. </page> <page sequence="40"> 348 chapter four Who pinched Hermes the Thief? Hot-headed [recklessly daring] is the  thief who took away the Lord of the Thieves (Ἑρμῆν τὸν κλέπτην τίς  ὑφείλετοŸ θερμὸς ὁ κλέπτης ȯς τῶν φιλητέων ʆχετ’ ἄνακτα φέρων).104 Why do we find Hermes in particular as a typical target and dupe in  various types of evidence?105 We shall return to this question,106 but  must first turn our attention to a final interesting feature of the Her- maic representations: the herm in a sacrificial context. Herms and sacrifice There are quite a number of vase paintings showing Hermes himself  bringing a libation or otherwise involved in a sacrificial act. Here, of  course, he is pictured in ‘human’ form, as are all other gods when pic- tured as involved in sacrificial activities.107 LIMC V gives a full survey,108  which sufficiently reconfirms Hermes’ involvement, often as an assis- tant, in sacrificial ceremonies: “Hermes ist Opferdiener κατ’ ἐξοχήν,”  104 CIG 2229; E.G. 1108. Eur. Rh 217 Ἑρμῆς, ὅς γε φιλητῶν ἄναξ, has the same  expression. On stolen statues of gods see: Pritchett 1998, 232 f.; A. Chaniotis, No Way  to Treat a Statue! Emotional Responses to Images, in A. Chaniotis (ed.), Unveiling  Emotions: Sources and Methods for the Study of Emotions in the Greek World (forth- coming 2011), nos. 37/38. Anth. Gr. XI, 176 has a beautiful parallel of a person stealing  a Hermes statue where the thief concludes: “Many pupils surpass their masters.”  105 Of course, as especially Aristophanes shows, authors could go to great length in  playing with gods without giving offence. However, “there are limits, even for Aris- tophanes: no essential levity touches the Maiden of the Acropolis or Demeter. (. . . . .)  Elsewhere the Athenians could take offence, and that not only at things which stirred  them as deeply as did the mutilation of the Hermae and the supposed parody of the  Eleusinian mysteries” (Nock, Essays II 543).  106 And, for the moment, n. 102 above. 107 E. Simon, Opfernde Götter (Berlin 1953) has collected the evidence for the great  gods, not including Hermes. Cf. A.F. Laurens, La libation: intégration des dieux dans  le rituel humain? Image et rituel en Grèce ancienne. Recherches et documents du Centre  Thomas More, 48 (1985) 35–59; F. Lissarague, La libation: essai de mise au point, ibid.  3–16; Veyne o.c. (above Ch. III n. 78). Recently, K.C. Patton, Religion of the Gods: Rit- ual, Paradox, and Reflexivity (Oxford 2009) studies sacrificing gods in ancient Greece  from a comparative perspective and proposes the new category of “divine reflexiv- ity.” Divinely performed ritual is a self-reflexive, self-expressive action that signals  the origin of ritual in the divine and not the human realm. Above all, divine ritual is  generative, both instigating and inspiring human religious activity. 108 Hermes bringing a libation alone (nos. 801–806); Hermes offering a libation to  another god (nos. 807–808); Hermes as an assistant in a sacrificial scene (nos. 809– 815); Hermes presenting or receiving a sacrifice (nos. 816–819); Hermes sacrificing a  billy-goat (819bis). Farnell, vol. V, 1909, 36 f. already emphasized their importance for  the nature of the god. Cf. Zanker 1965, 33–34. </page> <page sequence="41">  a god: why is hermes hungry? 349 thus Erika Simon.109 In one of these scenes he once more betrays his  wily nature. 10 (no. 820, c. 500 BC) shows the god approaching an  altar with a sacrificial victim, a formidable pig. On closer view, how- ever, the animal turns out to be a dog disguised as a pig.110 Once more  the god is trying to cheat a divine colleague, this time by presenting a  dog in the guise of a real sacrificial animal. I like to think that this is  the dog that had threatened to foul his herm in the fable no. 5 cited  above, unaware of Hermes’ fixed epithet “dog-slayer.”111 Interesting though these pictures may be, we must continue our  search for herms in vase painting. Fifth-century vase paintings fre- quently depict the herm standing beside an altar; human worshippers  either sacrifice on this altar, or pray to Hermes (as we have seen),  or perform other ritual acts like playing the flute or offering a liba- tion. LIMC 92–123 provides a list of 33 images of a herm at an altar.112  Four of them (nos. 100, 101, 102, 102bis) represent a sacrificial proces- sion, two of them, including 11 (102bis, late 5th c.) leading an animal  towards the herm; one (no. 103) is a nuptial procession passing by a  herm, four (nos. 104–107) present a libation, while ten (nos. 108–117)  picture offerings of various objects such as wreaths, twigs, plates of  fruit. Finally, six (nos. 118–123) present the sacrificial scene, all of  them displaying the most popular part of the ‘post-kill’ situation: the  roasting of the splanchna skewered on spits and held in or near the fire  by the splanchnoptes,113 often accompanied by a bearer of the kanoun  as in 12 (no. 121, 420–410 BC). Curiously, however, eight images (nos.  92–99) show a herm standing before an altar (once a louterion, and  once in a naiskos without an altar) without any sacrificial activity or  attending person, as in 13 (no. 92, 480–470 BC).114 Also the scenes of  109 oc.

Chittenden &amp; Rhys Carpenter, in AJA 52 (1948) 24–28 and AJA 50 (1950) 177–180,  respectively. 112 See also literature mentioned above n. 75. Van Straten 1995, 27–30, adds a few  more, and cf. Furley 1996, 21 f. On Hermes in a sacrificial context also Rückert 1998,  189–199, whose interpretation I will not always follow. More recently see also Jaillard  o.c. (below n. 123).  113 On this functionary and his tasks: Peirce 1993, 239–241; Robertson 1999. 114 “In the second quarter of the fifth century many vases show herms alone, with- out worshippers and with the only context given by an altar or a plaque in the back- ground,” thus Zanker 1965, 98–103. </page> <page sequence="42"> 350 chapter four individual worship of a herm without sacrifice that we discussed above  regularly depict the herm beside an altar.115 Archaeologists of earlier generations generally regarded the sacred  paraphernalia shown with herms on vase-paintings as indicative of a  sacred precinct of Hermes himself.116 More recently, however, scholars  tend to agree that the altars and temple entrances shown with herms  on vase-paintings may in fact show the herm set up beside another  god’s altar or sanctuary.117 The position of these altars is often local- ized outside a sanctuary as shown by the addition of columns, trees,  and boukrania of votive offerings and as Furley aptly notes, not all the  herms in Athens stood outside sanctuaries of Hermes. Van Straten  1995, 28, who deliberately entitles the relevant section of his book  “Sacrifices at herms” (not to or for herms), concludes (28): It follows from the above that the presence of a herm in a sacrificial  scene may mean no more than a rather general indication of the setting:  a sacrifice in some sanctuary (for herms could be encountered in any  sanctuary), or if we think of the herms at the doors of the private houses,  a domestic sacrificial ceremony.118 Perhaps we can be a bit more explicit about this. There is a curious par- adox in Hermes’ cultic existence: although he is one of the most popu- lar and often-mentioned deities of the Greek world, hardly any official  (polis-)cult and cult-place of the god is known. The very few sanctuaries  mentioned for him were predominantly located in Arcadia, the likely  115 Zanker 1965, 93. 116 So, for instance, Simon 1985, 294. This seems also to be the view of Rückert  1998, 189–199, as for instance in the following: “Hermes ist als Empfänger des Opfers  ‘persönlich’ anwesend. Doch auch sein Kultbild, der ‘irdische’ Vertreter des Göttes,  darf hier nicht fehlen.”  117 So Furley 1996, 23, who connects it with his main thesis that “his function in this  position would be to mediate between the worshipper standing outside the sanctuary  and sacrificing at the altar there, and the god inside.” Cf. Siebert LIMC V 1, 377: “Rien  n’autorise à identifier un sanctuaire d’H. lui-même chaque fois que son monument  jouxte un autel ou se trouve associé à une cérémonie sacrée.” On herms at entrances  of other gods’ temples also: Chr.A.

The fact is generally acknowledged in the well-known textbooks, but,  curiously, it is rarely if ever realized that without a temple or a cult- festival an official Olympian sacrifice is not to be expected either. So if Hermes is unique in that we have no knowledge of any regular  sanctuary of the god at all in Athens, and since we do know that herms  were indeed stereotyped residents in or in front of the sanctuaries of  119 The ‘temple’ for instance on the summit of Mount Kyllene, mentioned by Paus.  8.17.2, is most probably a cave. For Arcadian Hermes cults, see Jost 1985, index s.v.  Hermes. 120 G.B. Hussey, The Distribution of Hellenic Temples, AJA 6 (1890) 59–64, whose  paper aims at “measuring the reverence paid to each Greek divinity by means of  the number of temples dedicated to his worship,” concludes that “Hermes . . . is very  rare.” He boasts the 16th place in frequency and is only followed by Pan, Kore (not  combined with Demeter), Ares, Plouton, Moirai, and Ge. Nilsson 1906, 388, “Mit  dem Kulte des Hermes steht es eigentümlich. Er ist ein grosser Gott und ein allge- mein verehrter Gott, in Bild und Lied tausendmal dargestellt. Dennoch hat er wenige  Tempel und wenige Feste. Die uns bekannten Tempel können an den Fingern der  einen Hand hergezählt werden (Pheneos, Korinth, zwei in Tanagra, Halikarnassos  [for which see: ibid. 392 ff.], die Feste auch, wenn man die Agone und ganz besonders  die späteren, in fast jedem Gymnasium eingerichteten Hermaia in Abzug bringt.”  On the central role of the Hermes cult in the Hellenistic gymnasia see: S. Aneziri &amp;  D. Damaskos, Städtische Kulte im hellenistischen Gymnasion, in: D. Kah &amp; P. Scholz  (edd.), Das hellenistische Gymnasion (Berlin 2004) 247–271. Nilsson GGR I, 501 ff.,  gives a clear survey of Hermes’ scarce temples and festivals. This, of course, is not  to say that Hermes did not receive local cults at his herms, statues, sacred places,  rural sanctuaries. There is a long list of these in Farnell vol. V, 1909, 74 ff. (Rituals  and Festivals); 76–84 (Geographical Register of Hermes-Cults). An even longer one  in Eitrem, art. Hermes, RE VIII, 738–755. Rückert 1998, under ‘Hermenheiligtümer’  (185–189) discusses only rural cult places for Hermes (so-called Hermaia) and does  not mention temples. Mentions of sacrifices in cult calendars or other cult inscriptions  do not prove the existence of a temple. Cf. more recently: J. Larson, Handmaidens of  Artemis?

How to  imagine the structure and organisation of such a festival is best illustrated in detail by  the relevant passage in the gymnasiarchic law of Beroia, as re-edited and commented  on by Ph. Gauthier &amp; M.B. Hatzopoulos, La loi gymnasiarchique de Béroia (Athens  1993) ll. 45–84.  122 Deubner 1932 has nothing on Hermes except the reference to the local Hermaia:  “ein Turnfest.” Athenian Hermaia typical of the palaestra: Pl.

See: Pritchett 1998, 263. </page> <page sequence="44"> 352 chapter four other gods, the conclusion becomes ever more compelling that the  sacrificial rituals involving animal victims depicted in the paintings  either belong to domestic cult—but is that worthy enough a subject  for such a considerable number of vase paintings?—or are not on his  behalf.123 Hermes, as a herm, is simply there, gazing and witnessing  the offering of god’s portions—namely the parts that are burned in  the fire: mêria (thighbones wrapped in fat); the osphys (the sacrum  plus the tail)—, and the preparation of the human’s portions—namely  the splanchna (heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys [Arist. Part.an.665a– 672b], what the modern Greek calls kokoretsi), neither of which seems  to be intended for his watering mouth. The mere idea makes one hun- gry. So this is a timely reminder that we need to return to our point  of departure: hungry Hermes. 5. Hungry Hermes: The Sacrificial Meal124 Will, then, our poor divine hetairos remain utterly deprived of any- thing decent to ‘gobble up’? I am not the first to worry about the  123 On the basis of a more complete collection of images, D. Jaillard, Le pillier  hermaique dans l’espace sacrificiel, MEFRA 113 (2001) 341–363, too, argues that the  herms in the sacrificial scenes are not intended as the addressees of the sacrifice and  interprets their function as mediating between mortals and the gods and as ‘organiz- ers’ of the whole procedure. I refer the reader to this article for further information.  Note especially the several scenes in which the herm is approached by the adorant  with a gesture of supplication (hand at the beard as in our figs. 1 and 2) and the Pelike  from Boston LIMC 171, 440–430, where a servant heaves a herm (comparable with fig.  8 above) onto the pedestal of the altar. 124 On divine and human culinary aspects of the sacrificial materials there is an  abundant literature. Still fundamental is P. Stengel, Opferbraüche der Griechen (Leipzig  1910). No less fundamental, in fact indispensable, are two recent studies. First, the  chapter ‘Post-Kill’ in Van Straten 1995, 131 ff. (Cf. idem, The God’s Portion in Greek  Sacrificial Representations: Is the Tail doing Nicely?, in: Hägg 1988, 51–68). Secondly,  the systematic discussion by Ekroth 2008. Cf. also J. Bertiaume, Les rôles du mageiros.  Étude sur la boucherie, la cuisine et le sacrice dans la Grèce ancienne (Leiden 1982)  and the survey in ThesCRA I, 59–134. On the performative aspect, brief but informa- tive: Jameson 1999. On ethological, social and evolutionary aspects: B. Gladigow, Die  Teilung des Opfers.

Baudy, Hier- archie oder: Die Verteilung des Fleisches, in: B. Gladigow &amp; H.G. Kippenberg (edd.),  Neue Ansätze in der Religionswissenschaft (Munich 1983) 131–174. The idea of priests  or private people receiving and eating the parts that the gods have left after hav- ing ‘partaken of’ the sacrificial food is widely thematized in ancient NE culture.

It is impossible within the scope of this chapter to  thoroughly discuss the whole complex but I will single out a few of  the most interesting and to my mind most relevant data. First of all,  I consciously used the expression ‘to gobble up’, because Greek verbs  with this meaning or connotation are consistently used for Hermes  in connection with the partaking of food, more especially sacrificial  food. It is also the way Hermes’ craving for meat was referred to in  the hymn: κρειῶν ἐρατίζων, ‘hankering after meat’, which he desired  to—but did not—‘gulp down’ (καί τε μάλ’ ἱμείροντι περᾶν ἱερῆς κατὰ  δειρῆς 133). 1. “The warm splanchna which I used to gobble up” Let us begin with a vexed problem concerning the splanchna.125 In  contradistinction to the gods’ parts which were burned on the altar,  these innards, being the most popular humans’ portion, were roasted,  distributed among those participating in the sacrifice, and immediately  consumed on the spot, while still warm. However, two passages in  Aristophanes, both picturing the effects of a ‘sacrificial strike’126 seem  to intimate that not only human participants but also the gods had  their share of the splanchna. In the Birds (Ar. Av. 1515–1520) we read how, since the city in the  clouds was built, the gods’ portions of the sacrifices can no longer  reach the gods, because the knise from the mêria (κνῖσα μηρίων ἄπο  1517) does not rise to the skies anymore. The barbarian gods, screech- ing like Illyrians in their deprivation, threaten to march on Zeus unless  he gets the markets (lit. trading posts: τὰ ἐμπόρια) reopened and the  sliced splanchna (σπλάγχνα κατατετμημένα) introduced again.127 125 See most recently: Ekroth 2008, 93–95, with earlier literature in n. 33.  126 Auffarth 1994a presents a fundamental treatment of this phenomenon, includ- ing the passages under discussion here. Cf. also idem, Braucht Gott ein Opfer? Opfer- praxis und Opferkritik in der griechischen Religionsgeschichte, in: D.

Hymn to Demeter 305 ff.  127 The allusion is to the well-known relation between Greek colonists and the  native population, who would withdraw inland but would make occasional attacks on  the incomers in their trading posts (ἐμπόρια).

Penetration, Early Establishment and the Problem of  the “Emporion” Revisited (Oxford 2005). </page> <page sequence="46"> 354 chapter four In a somewhat similar situation in the Plutus, Hermes complains that  “nobody offers frankincense anymore, nor laurel, nor barley cakes, no  animal victim, nothing at all to us, the gods” (οὐδεὶς οὐ λιβανωτόν,  οὐ δάφνην, οὐ ψαιστόν, οὐχ ἱερεῖον, οὐκ ἄλλ’ οὐδὲ ἓν ἡμῖν ἔτι θύει  τοῖς θεοῖς, 1114 f.). He goes on lamenting: “Now, I don’t care about  the other gods, but I myself am starved to death,” listing all good fare  he is now missing: “the goodies I got from barmaids from early dawn:  wine cake, honey, dried figs, the titbits Hermes likes to eat” (ὅσ’ εἰκός  ἐστιν Ἑρμῆν ἐσθίειν, 1123). “But now I am starving.” (. . . . . .) “Oh the  good cheese cakes I received at my month day.”128 “Grief for the ham  that I used to gobble up” (οἴμοι δὲ κωλῆς ȏν ἐγὼ κατήσθιον, 1128).  Then follows the final item of the list: “And for the warm innards  (splanchna) which I used to gobble up” (σπλάγχνων τε θερμῶν ɋν ἐγὼ  κατήσθιον, 1130);129 “woe for the wine cup with the equal mix of wine  and water” (1132). From these two passages it has been extrapolated that generally  “the god to whom the sacrifice was offered received a portion of the  splanchna as well.”130 In my view, however, the contexts do not tol- erate such an inference since both refer to exceptional gods inter- ested in an exceptional menu. In the first passage a clear distinction  is drawn between ‘normal’ Greek Olympian gods feeding on (that is  sniffing) knise,131 and barbarian gods enjoying a different diet, namely  128 The fourth day of the month (H.Hermes 19), on which the god received cakes:  Schol. a.l.; Theophr. Char. 16.10. 129 The verb is often used for the way animals wolf down their food, and always  implies greediness.  130 Van Straten 132. So, too, Dunbar comm. Aves, ad 518 f. and 1520 ff. also refer- ring to Plut. 1128 ff. The same also in Olson ad Pax 1140 and Ekroth 2008, 93 n. 37.  Furley 1996, 26, on “the thighbones, the innards and the wine”, writes: “these were the  normal ingredients of an Olympian sacrifice (. . .). I suspect a joke behind the reference  to herms gobbling down such sumptuous offerings: they may not have been meant  for Hermes; rather as the thieving messenger god, he pilfered them from their rightful  recipient en route.” Although I, too, will argue that there is a pun intended, it cannot  be the one Furley proposes, since at least the two edible ingredients are not the gods’  but the humans’ portion. Ekroth 2008, 94, rightly assumes that, if gods participated in  the ‘consumption’ of splanchna during the actual thusia, this, too, was in the form of  knise from the splanchna that were burnt together with the mêria as a gift to the gods.  For splanchna as part of the trapezomata see below. 131 Despite all satirical puns on ‘smoke’ as an offering there cannot be any doubt  that the knise rising from the burnt mêria was generally understood as the god’s por- tion par excellence.

The  explicit emphasis is on their non-Greek identity—they are called Trib- alloi, a proverbially savage tribe,132 a few lines later—and behaviour.  They do not keep to the Olympian dinner-codes, preferring splanchna  (the humans’ portion) over knise. The very same is true for Hermes in the second passage, and the  method is analogous. Hermes first complains that nobody brings any  sacrifice to the gods, listing as we have seen: no incense, no bay, no  barley cake, no victim (ἱερεῖον) (1114 ff.). All of these are indeed  regular burnt offerings, the first and last offered by the well-to-do, the  second and third by the poor.133 However, Hermes himself “does not  care about (the meals of ) the other gods,” but about his own favou- rite dishes. And these are of a conspicuously different nature: without  exception they consist of all kinds of titbits typical of human diets.  The goodies from the barmaids are the customary small gifts placed  at the herms,134 and so were the ‘month-day’ cakes. The ham (named  κωλή, thighbone with a good deal of flesh still on it), as opposed to  the μηρία/μηρός, the bare thighbones135 (which are the god’s portion),  (Turin, 1996) 239–83, espec. 270; Ekroth 2008, 88 ff.

The Osteologi- cal Evidence as a Source for Greek Ritual Norms, in: Brulé 2009, 125–151, on meria  and osphys as god’s parts. The Comicus Pherekrates even makes a god complain that  men give only the completely barren bones to the gods and the poorness of the god’s  part is a ready target of comic puns. These meria would not have been very attractive  for Hermes to gobble up. With only one exception (see below n. 137) Aristophanes is  consistent in referring to the thighbones in their function as gods’ portions as μηρία,  never as κωλαί. So here, too, κωλή cannot be the gods’ part. In other authors the dis- tinction between the two terms is not always consistent: e.g. Aesch. PV 496;  Ameipsias  as quoted by van Straten 1995, 154 n. 132. G. Berthiaume, L’aile ou les mêria, in  </page> <page sequence="48"> 356 chapter four mentioned as one of Hermes’ favourite dishes, was a portion regularly  set aside for the priest after a sacrifice.136 How deliberately the poet is  alluding to Hermes’ singularly ‘human’ appetite throughout this whole  passage is demonstrated in lines 1136 f. where the starving god asks  for bread to ‘gobble down’ and a “piece of the meat of the sacrifice  you are bringing inside the house”137 and gets as an answer the ritual  prescription well-known from leges sacrae ἀλλ’ οὐκ ἐκφορά (‘export  forbidden’/’no take away’).138 Here, then, Hermes is pictured as acting  in full compliance with human lines of conduct in sacrificial ritual. The conclusion must be that the expression σπλάγχνων τε θερμῶν  ɋν ἐγὼ κατήσθιον from the mouth of Hermes among this accumula- tion of references to human consumption in a sacrificial context must  refer to the conventional imagery of splanchna as the humans’ por- Georgoudi 2005, espec. 244–249, revives the discussion whether μηρία can also mean  thighbones with their meat (= κωλαί) and argues that in some testimonia the gods  were regaled with the latter variant. However, the very few texts which seem to say as  much are at most exceptions that prove the rule (Men. Dysc. 447–453 has no probative  value at all). Moreover, see the perfect division between men’s and gods’ parts in a  lex sacra from Phrearrioi which has in l.5 [ἱερεώσ]υνα κωλὴν πλευρὸν ἰ&lt;σ&gt;χ[ίον. . . . .]  and in ll. 15/16: ἐπὶ δὲ τοɞς βωμοɞς[. . . . . . . . .] μηροɞς μασχαλίσματα ἡμίκραιρ[αν. . . . . .

The parts of the victim most frequently included  are a ham or a leg, the head or half of it, portions of splanchna and meat, and, above  all, the skin. In addition to parts of the victim the priests regularly received sacrificial  cakes of every conceivable description, which also would first have been placed on the  holy table.

Buxton  (ed.), Oxford Readings in Greek Religion (Oxford 2000) 294–313, espec. 308 with n. 44,  emphasizes that female priests as well as the women who made the sacrifice shared  in the roasted viscera.  137 This is closely similar to Trygaios’ behaviour in Ar. Pax 1021 ff., where he, too,  wants the animal to be sacrificed indoors and orders that the thighbones be brought  to him personally outside. This is the only time that Aristophanes uses the word μηρία  instead of κωλή. 138 See the good note by Van Leeuwen ad. loc., who mentions two testimonia in  other authors who use this expression as a comic pun.

Hermes is here seen in the rôle of a human participant  in a sacrificial context, who as distinct from the other gods is only  interested in ‘gobbling down’ sacrificial portions “while still warm.”  The mere wording of this line, in addition to contextual arguments,  should have warned commentators against adducing it as a testimony  that gods, too, may partake in the consumption of splanchna. This is not to say that this idea should never have emerged in lit- erature or practice. For, as Ekroth 2008, 93 says: “There are elements  which negotiate the distance between gods and men expressed in the  thysia sacrifice.” In Aristophanes’ Birds 518–9, we are informed about  the ‘custom’ (νόμος) of placing the splanchna literally in the hands  of the gods: ȡν’ ὅταν θύων τις ἔπειτ' αὐτοῖς εἰς τὴν χεῖρ', ὡς νόμος  ἐστίν, τὰ σπλάγχνα διδˑ. However, this is the only record of such a  custom in Greek literature and hence can hardly be extrapolated into  a general ritual pattern.139 More relevant is the fact that splanchna may  139 See: Dunbar comm. ad. loc. Cult statues with their hands outstretched are once  referred to in Ar. Eccl. 778–83, where however the context suggests different types of  gifts than splanchna. Coins as votive gifts, for instance, are common both in antiquity  and in modern times. They were laid down before the feet of the statue or attached  to the thighs with wax (Lucian Philops. 20; Weinreich 1909, 138; Versnel 1981a, 34;  K. Tsakos, in: D. Vassiliou &amp; M. Lykiardopoulou (edd.), Coinage and Religion. The  Ancient World—The Byzantine World. Proceedings of a one-day colloquium [Athens  1997] 33–48). As Van Straten notes, archaeological evidence of gods with itching  palms is lacking, unless we take gods with a phiale into consideration, which may  well be the model for Aristophanes’ pun. The whole imagery is indeed so singular that  scholars have had great difficulty in interpreting a couple of inscriptions from Chios,  all explicitly pertaining to the priests’ parts, with stereotyped lists such as: σπλάγχνα,  τὰ ἐς χείρας καὶ γούνατα (splanchna, “the parts in the hands and on the knees”),  καὶ γλῶσσαν καὶ κρεῶν δύο μοίρας: LSS 77, 6–7; LSS 129, 4–6. Cf. also: LSS 76, 4;  LSS 119, 4; 120, 2. Puttkammer 1912, 21ff. suggested that this means the parts of  splanchna that had been deposited in the hands and on the knees of the cult statue.  This would imply that cult statues of various different gods would have had this form.  The proposal of Sokolowski ad LSS no. 77 ll. 6–7 that it should refer to the money  paid for taking home the feet of animals and the knees of pigs meets with too many  objections. See especially Graf 1985, 40 f.; also Jameson 1994, 40 n. 22; Van Straten  1995, 132 f., followed by G. Berthiaume o.c. above (n. 135) espec. 244, and next note.  Even so, Robertson 1999, 178 n. 21, is right when he comments on the Chios inscrip- tions: “Such a drastic procedure is not only unlikely in itself, but inconsistent with the  fuller form of expression, unless we suppose that a seated statue also had outstretched  hands, and received a double helping of splanchna.” However, his own suggestion: “It  is rather that the deity is imagined [my italics] to be seated at the table, with hands  and knees ready for the splanchna,” seems to be even less probable. In sum: non liquet.  Whatever it is, it is unique for Chios and Aristophanes can hardly be expected to have  referred to this. Ekroth 2008, 100 n. 73, is right in suggesting that placing splanchna  in the hands of a god is functionally just the same as dealing with the trapezomata.  Auffarth 1994a, 61 n. 7, refers to a church at Crete where he saw an icon with carved  </page> <page sequence="50"> 358 chapter four form part of the so-called trapezomata, foodstuffs placed on a holy  table (trapeza) either as a specific and independent form of offering  or—as quite often—as an attached, more concrete entremets for the  gods added to the central thusia.140 In the autonomous form it also is  the way in which the so-called theoxenia is organized: a table (hiera  trapeza, trapezoma) is spread and a banqueting couch is laid out for  the divine guest. In its official variant this particular type of divine  commensality, which presupposes a visit and presence of the god in  person during its performance, does not seem to have been shared  by the human hosts.141 In its private forms, however, it is commonly  shared by the worshippers,142 in contrast to conventional sacrifice,  which distinguishes between human and divine portions. Though the  term theoxenia is known only from the cult of Apollo in Delphi and  the Dioscuri the ritual is much more common than has generally been  assumed.143 This sacrificial type of commensality, however, is not even  wooden arms fixed below it, on which the faithful could suspend gifts. Incidentally,  putting things “in the arms” of a god(dess) (κατατίθεμαι εἰς τὰς ἀγκάλας τῆς θεο˃)  does occur in manumissio inscriptions (where it concerns the deeds of sale of slaves):  Petsas e.a. 2000, nos. 3, 63, 93.  140 Sometimes, but not always in the form that the main gods got a thusia, the  lesser associates a ‘table’: Jameson 1994, 39 f.

This is different for the trapezomata as an ‘attached’ form of offer- ing, added to the burnt sacrifice. Generally, raw parts of the sacrificial  victim—most frequently including a ham or a leg, the head or half  of it, portions of meat145—would be deposited upon a table.146 And it  is these gifts for the gods that might also include splanchna. In addi- tion, a rich variety of sacrificial cakes of every conceivable description  could be placed on the holy table.147 Now, we have just encountered  a majority of these ingredients as fixed elements of the priest’s por- tion, and the complication (and frequent cause of confusion) is that it  is hardly possible to distinguish the god’s portion from what is nor- mally called the ‘priest’s portion’.148 In many—epigraphical—cult pre- scriptions parts of the victim are directly and exclusively assigned to  the priest as his γέρας. In others they are explicitly and exclusively  referred to as intended for the god. Sometimes both the θεομοιρία  and the ἱερὰ μοῖρα (but these terms are not always distinctive either)  are mentioned in one and the same lex sacra. Here are two revealing  formulations of this ambivalence. A modern one in the warning of  Van Straten 1995, 155. 144 Hermes’ visits in person to human habitats, to which I will return at pp. 367– 370, though distantly related, are of a different nature. 145 The skin, a very typical priest’s portion, would not have been placed on the  table.  146 Robertson 1999, 178 contends that table offerings are typical of healing cults,  “since the deity must come to the scene in order to heal” and gives examples from  the cult of Asklepios, which, for lack of comparative material about other gods, is  not conclusive. He also states that the favourite portion on the table is the “inwards,  splanchna,” for which he does not give any evidence at all.  147 See: E. Kearns, Cakes in Greek Sacrificial Regulations, in: Hägg 1994, 64–70.  The cakes are often destined to be burnt as an extra offering over the fire roasting  the entrails (ἐπιθύειν), but an offering in advance (προθύειν) also occurs (ibid. in n. 9  extensive references). The size is often indicated in sacrificial calendars. A. Brumfield,  Cakes in the Liknon. Votives from the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore on Acro- corinth, Hesperia 66 (1997) 147–172, details the many different types and names of  cakes in the Demeter cult.  148 On the problem see: Puttkammer 1912, 19–31; Gill 1991 (above n. 140), 15 f.;  Jameson 1994, 40 f. with n. 23; 56 f. with n. 83. More literature on the priest’s portion  above n. 136. Very rarely also secular persons could be honoured with priestly gera. In  I.Mylasa I 119, ll. 10 ff., a euergetes is honoured by one of the phylai of the city and will  henceforth receive “a share from all the sacrifices contributed by the phyle” (μέριδα ἐκ  τῶν θυσιῶν πασῶν τῶν ὑπὸ [τ]ῆς φυλῆς συντελουμέν[ων).

At the moment  that a worshipper deposited these offerings on the holy table, they  were gifts to the god, even though he knew full well where they would  end up. An ancient Greek one, in I.Erythrae 205,149 where it is ordained that: (ll. 13 ff.) if you sacrifice an ox, you have to place at the table, for the god  (τῶι θεῶι), three pieces of meat and splanchna, (ll. 23–25) all things that have been placed on the table are the perqui- sites for the priest (ὅσα δὲ ἐπὶ τὴν τράπεζαν παρατεθῆι τα˃τα εȢναι γέρα  τῶι ἱερεῖ). The two statements, ancient and modern, convey the same message,  the latter displaying a matter of fact, not to say cynical, touch. There  is no attempt to conceal the aspect of pia fraus. The obvious destiny  of the foodstuffs makes them an easy pray for comic puns: in Ar. Pax  1059, the charlatan-priest Hierokles asks: “Where is the table?” (πο˃  τράπεζαŸ), which he wishes to be understood as referring to his priestly  duties in honour of the god, but which to the audience rather betrays  his interest in the priest’s portions heaped on it.150 Such ambivalences might perhaps throw some suspicion on the  validity of the distinctions between gods’ and humans’ portions in the  testimonia that I have so far adduced, but such doubts are unnec- essary. First, as was so glaringly exemplified in the two phrases of  the Erythraean inscription, the decision of which of the two possible  options is intended depends entirely and exclusively on focus and  context: although the author of the cult text is perfectly aware that  the trapezomata are intended for both god and priest, he also knows  how to preserve each beneficiary for the right moment and context.  A second consideration, however, is far more relevant to our issue.  Puns as presented in literary sources of a comical, satirical, ironical or  derogatory nature, such as the ones that we are exploring in this chap- ter, are entirely dependent on the existence of stereotypes. In order to  elicit laughter by evoking a surprising deviation from or reversal of  149 = LSAM 24, for Asklepios, discussed by Graf 1985, 250 ff., “Obwohl ausdrück- lich bestimmt wird, diese Gaben seien für den Gott, wird abschliessend festgelegt, dass  sie alle dem Priester zukommen sollten.” I refer the reader to his perceptive discussion  of this ambiguity.  150 Van Straten 1995, 165. </page> <page sequence="53">  a god: why is hermes hungry? 361 normality there must exist a generally accepted imagery of normality  to begin with. Hence, in our case the sources that play on sacrificial  food consistently reveal—and exploit—a stereotyped general imagery.  Splanchna are typically the humans’ portion, kolai are typically the  priest’s portion, as are the tongue,151 the head (or half of it) and the skin,  whereas mêria (burnt) are typically the gods’ portion as are the sacrum  and the tail.152 Accordingly, in the literary texts discussed so far as well  as in the ones that will be brought up shortly, the Olympian gods are  never presented or imagined as munching edible food and enjoying  solid dishes, raw or roasted.153 Nor are they ever associated with their  ‘holy table’ without being immediately referred back to their typical  diet: the knise. Hermes, on the other hand, in the same texts typically  never stops gobbling down, or at least hankering after, any part of  sacrificial foodstuffs he can lay his hand on. In those passages where  one of these stereotypes is not intended, the reader must be warned by  helpful hints or clues.154 151 On the tongue of the victim as priests’s prerogative see: E. Kadletz, The Tongues  of Greek Sacrificial Victims, HThR 74 (1981) 21–29, mainly on the basis of epigraphi- cal evidence. N. Robertson, in: W.J. Slater (ed.), Dining in a Classical Context (Ann  Arbor 1991) 25–57, espec. 31 f., comments on the handling of the victim’s tongue  in leges sacrae: the tongue is usually the priests perquisite (testimonia at p. 49 n. 36)  together with other portions, or belongs to the table offerings (49 n. 38), which as  we have seen are essentially identical. Furley 1996, 24 f., emphasizes its role as a pre- rogative of the herald, in his function of assistant at sacrifices, hence also in a priestly  function. The only time it is used with reference to Hermes is in Ar. Plut. 1110, where  Trygaios says when Hermes arrives announcing bad news: ἡ γλῶττα τˑ κήρυκι τούτων  τέμνεται. The scholia interpret it as intended for Hermes for being a good messenger  on account of a proverb ἡ γλῶττα τˑ κήρυκι, but scholarly opinions differ widely. 152 Significant in this respect is the stereotyped imagery in vase painting of the simul- taneous actions of the burning of osphys for the gods and the roasting of splanchna  for the human participants: Peirce 1993, 230–234. L. Scubla, Sur le mythe de Promé- thée et l’analyse du sacrifice grec, Europe 904–905 (2004) (Mythe et mythologie dans  l’Antiquité gréco-romaine) 55–72, while strictly maintaining the distinction between  the two, interprets this (in the words of Sineux 2006, 68f.) as “une forme de commen- salité qui permet aux mortels de participer à la nature des immortels.” 153 This means that the ambivalent nature of the eatables on the trapeza (officially  intended as gods’ portion but in practice ending up as the priest’s part), cannot serve  as proof that Hermes did gobble up (or craved) gods’ portions. This aspect, though  prevailing in epigraphical texts, is lacking in the relevant literary sources.  154 There is one additional, but significant, hint that the preparing and eating of  splanchna is a typical human part of the sacrificial process. This is the frequent rep- resentation of Herakles in the rôle of splanchnoptes focussing on his avid preparation  of splanchna on spits. He is pictured here in his ususal character of a glutton, with a  special pun on his ability to down an entire bull. The evidence in: J.-L. Durand, Sacrifice  et labour en Grèce ancienne (Paris 1986) 145–173; cf. J.-L. Durand &amp; A. Schnapp, Sacri- ficial Slaughter and Initiatory Hunt, in: C. Bérard et alii (edd.), City of Images (Prince- </page> <page sequence="54"> 362 chapter four The suggestion of hunger, gluttony and a peculiar preference for a  human fashion in table manners emerging from these passages proves  indeed to be a stereotyped trait in the god’s description. An extended  passage in Ar. Pax 179 ff. provides precious information. The gods  have retired to a higher sphere. When Trygaios flies up to heaven he  encounters Hermes at the threshold of Zeus’ residence, left behind  there to guard—significantly—the gods’ “cooking utensils: stew-pots  and casseroles and amphoras.” When Trygaios and the chorus attempt  to rescue Peace, who is locked up in a grotto, Hermes (375) comes and  announces that he has orders from Zeus to kill Trygaeus. The latter  begs for mercy, reminding him of (378 f.) “the meat that I so kindly  brought you” (ναὶ πρὸς τῶν κρεῶν DZγὼ προθύμως σοι φέρων ἀφικόμην,  cf. 192, where Trygaios had offered the meat to Hermes). The cho- rus, consisting of peasants, reminds the god (385 f.) of “the welcome  piglet that you got from me and gobbled down” (εἴ τι κεχαρισμένον  χοιρίδιον οȢσθα παρ' ἐμο˃ γε κατεδηδοκώς). At 393 the chorus  beseeches the god to cooperate, addressing him as Ɋ φιλανθρωπότατε  καὶ μεγαλοδωρότατε δαιμόνων, and promises to conduct lavish sacri- fices and processions in his honour (395 f.: καί σε θυσίαισιν ἱεραῖσι  προσόδοις τε μεγάλαισι διὰ παντός, Ɋ δέσποτ', ἀγαλο˃μεν ἡμεῖς ἀεί),  indeed to reallocate all the major Athenian festivals (Panathenaia, the  great Mysteries etc.) to Hermes himself (418–422). Not bad at all for  a god who in reality cannot boast one single official festival in the city  of Athens. Hermes now leads those present in a sacrificial ceremony  including the prayer to the gods.155 Once more the focus is on hungry Hermes. After Peace has returned  to earth, the crowds of peasants returning to their farms give Hermes  (565) Utopian visions of “barley cake and copious banquets.” When,  much later, Trygaios suggest offerings of pots of beans to goddess Peace  ton 1989) 56 f.; Peirce 1993, 239 f. On Herakles as a proverbial glutton in Old Comedy  and Satyr Play: G.K. Galinsky, The Herakles Theme (Oxford 1972) 81–93; Wilkins 2000,  90–96. The same holds for Satyrs preparing splanchna: Peirce 1993, 240. 155 Furley 1996 put much emphasis on this in order to support his thesis of Hermes  the mediator. Indeed, this play contains abundant evidence of Hermes in his role  as hermeneus between men and gods. This is, of course, not inconsistent with the  emphatic human aspects of his nature, as among others Gh. Jay-Robert, Fonction  des dieux chez Aristophane. Exemple de Zeus, d’Hermès et de Dionysos, REA 104  (2002) 11–24, espec. 16–19, argues: “un tel rôle (i.e. de médiateur) en fait donc un dieu  proche des hommes.” So, too, A.M. Bowie, Aristophanes. Myth, Ritual and Comedy  (Cambridge 1993) 279. </page> <page sequence="55">  a god: why is hermes hungry? 363 (χύτραις ἱδρυτέον, 922), this is a final reference to another of Hermes’  culinary peculiarities. The chorus indignantly replies: “What, stew- pots, like a wretched little Hermes?” (χύτραισιν, ὥσπερ μεμφόμενον  ἙρμίδιονŸ), referring to the chutroi, that other humble—and far from  Olympian—delicacy that was presented to the god at the third day of  the Anthesteria. Finally, a few words about one peculiar text which seems to reveal  another ungodly type of culinary preference of our god. In the course  of a sacrifice pictured in Ar. Pax 1039 ff., one of Trygaios’ slaves says  to Trygaios: “Take the (two) thighbones (τὼ μηρώ) and lay them on  the altar. I’ll go fetch the splanchna and the thulemata.” Thulemata can  be defined as alphita (barley groats or meal) sprinkled with wine and  olive oil added as a supplement to the sacrifices for the gods.156 From  different texts it is clear that these thulemata were often kneaded into  small lumps or pellets.157 Most probably the comic author Telekleides  had this variant in mind when he made a person invite the god Hermes  with the words: “O Lord Hermes, gulp down some of the thulemata”  (Ɋ δέσποτ' Ἑρμῆ, κάπτε τῶν θυλημάτων).158 Contrary to the splanchna,  these thulemata are definitely and as far as we know exclusively part  of the god’s portion and destined to be burnt together with the μήρια.  Here, however, this god’s portion, before it can be transformed into  knise palatable to Olympians, is adapted to Hermes’ taste in that it is  not burnt: he gorges them raw.159 It evokes a scene where Hermes, in  the shape of a herm invariably present at sacrifices, is regaled with  little titbits that we see him treated to in his most common culinary  ambiance, which we shall discuss in the following section. 156 Scholion Ar. Pax 1040: θυλήματαż τὰ τοῖς θεοῖς ἐπιθυόμενα ἄλφιτα. ἐπιρραίνεται  δὲ οἴνˎ καὶ ἐλαίˎ.  157 On all this: Van Straten 1995, 141–144. 158 Ɩηλεκλείδης ἐν ƕτερροῖς fr. 35 PCG = CAF 33. 159 These thulemata are identical or closely resemble the οὐλαί, barley groates  which were also thrown on animal and altar before burning the victim. F. Graf in:  Horstmanshoff 2002, 121 points out that this is “primeval food, not really eaten any- more by human beings in historical Greece. In an Argive ritual the first meat roasted  after rekindling the hearth is obtained in exchange for barley. It thus symbolizes the  period before roasted meat, when man did not yet use fire.” If so, poor little Hermes  on the sacrificial scene, regaled on barley crumbs, is thus pictured in the same position  as in the hymn before he roasted the first meat for the gods. But I am not sure whether  he or the other participants were aware of that fact.  </page> <page sequence="56"> 364 chapter four So far our conclusion may be that if a comic author wants to give  people a real good laugh the easiest way is to make some juicy allusions  to dietary niceties. But that much we knew already. Like all authors  of comedy Aristophanes is fond of it.160 More directly relevant to our  issue is that the poet is consistent in the nature of his allusions: nor- mal Olympians may be greedy, hungry, bereft of food, but with one  doubtful exception (the splanchna placed in the outstretched hands)  this is always alluded to in terms of their customary ritual portion of  the s acrifice, namely the knise (or its interruption).161 Hermes, on the  other hand, is constantly pictured as insatiably hungry, indeed as hun- gry by definition, hence continuously on the lookout for food. How- ever, his diet is never knise but always concrete foodstuffs, very much  including sacrificial meat and without exception the humans’ portions,  especially the splanchna, or the priest’s part, for instance the ham.  Accordingly, his manner of eating is equally consistently described as  “gobbling down.” 2. “The titbits Hermes likes to eat” After this presentation of sacrificial eatables that either were not intended  for Hermes’ watering mouth (as in the section on herms) or remained  at the level of craving or reminiscence (as in fable or comedy), it is time  to briefly discuss a dish that has a niche in real life and which justly  may be called Hermes’ ‘special’. The “good things” Hermes was treated  to by “barmaids” in the Plutus, such as wine, cakes, honey, dried figs,  “which are fitting for Hermes to eat” (ὅσ’ εἰκός ἐστιν Ἑρμῆν ἐσθίειν),  are, in the vernacular of daily life, known as hermaia, the titbits depos- 160 For the other comic authors see: J. Wilkins, The Significance of Food and Eating  in Greek Comedy, LCM 18 (1993) 66–74; idem, Comic Cuisine: Food and Eating in  the Comic Polis, in: Dobrov 1997, 250–270; Wilkins 2000 provides a full collection of  the testimonia from comedy.

In everyday practice these meals normally tended to be rather  the inverse of customary meals, consisting as they did of offal, and in  the case of Hecate very unsavoury offal at that—besides cakes, cheese,  fish also puppies.167 The term of abuse Ἑκαταῖα κατεσθίειν168 is used  to disqualify a person as a rogue. In sum, the proverbial ‘eaters of Hekataia and Hermaia’ are, to put  it in complimentary terms, a caricature of the priests to whom in the  end the offerings placed on the sacred tables would normally fall. Or  to put it in less complimentary terms, they mirror the bomolochos, the  person who lurks by the altar in the desperate hope of snatching offer- ings for his own consumption.169 In an unofficial way, both Hermaia  and Hekataia display the very same pia fraus that we discovered in the  cult prescriptions concerning priests’ part and gods’ part, as specified  by a scholion stating that “the rich sent a deipnon in the evening as  an offering, but the poor used to come and eat it but said that it was  Hekate who had eaten it” (ἡ Ἑκάτη ἔφαγεν αὐτά).170 The phenomenon of the hermaia—although, or precisely because, it  is so peculiar—corroborates the image emerging from earlier evidence.  The (simple) offerings at the herms once more put the god in a singu- lar position: in contradistinction to burnt offerings as for the normal  Olympian gods, the Hermaia are of the nature of—or if one wishes, a  parody of—an edible human meal. Besides, there is a constant waver- 167 Different from the Hermaia, these offerings to Hekate were, besides dishes, also  purifications. The less appetizing bits of the ‘meal’, such as, most particularly, the pup- pies, belonged to the katharmata/katharsia, offscourings of any kind, which gradually  became confounded with the more culinary elements in the ‘meals’ proper. See on  this ambiguity fundamentally: Knibbeler 2005. Cf. on this and various other types  of sacrifice ‘by elimination’: A. Zographou, Élimination rituelle et sacrifice en Grèce  ancienne, in: Georgoudi 2005, 197–214. Hekate herself, for that matter, was “eater of  excrements” (borborophorba PGM IV 1402. Cf. Hippocr. Morb. sacr. 1.VI.360f. (Lit- tré): excrements indicate Hekate Enodia). See: Burkert 1996a, 46 f. 168 Dem. 54.39. Interesting with respect to both Hermes and Hekate is a similar  negative notion in the words σκύβαλα and ἀπομαγδαλιά (O. Masson, Nouvelles notes  d’anthroponomie grècque, ZPE 112 [1996] 143–150; J.-L. Perpillou, Du manger de  chien, REA 100 [1998] 325–339). The first term is a corruption of (ἐ)ς κύνας βάλε  (“throw it to the dogs”) and both words mean ‘the scraps of food that are left for the  dogs’ (animals which, by the way, in Homer are called τραπεζῆες, ‘table mates’). We  have seen that both Hermes and Hekate in various different ways are connected with  dogs. See also: A. Zografou, Hécate et Hermès.

Target of human  jokes and canine anointments, Hermes in his form of a herm is once  more the underdog, as far as consumption is concerned. Sometimes  however, he fares better, as we will see now. 3. “Companion of the feast” (δαιτὸς ἑταɛρε) “Between the simple offerings at meals and the more structured and  formal theoxenia comes the offering made by Eumaios the swineherd  in his hut (Od. 14.418–456).” Thus Jameson 1994, 38, who does not  enlarge on the subject. Others did.172 For her interpretation of the her- maic sacrifice in the hymn as actually representing a dais eïse,173 in  171 And not only by rogues. Two epigrams in the Anth. Pal., IX 72 and 316, beauti- fully illustrate the miserable position of the Hermes statue/herm. Both mention two  gods—apparently in a statuesque form, most likely herms—guarding the borders:  Hermes and Herakles. In no. 316, Hermes complains to the passers-by that Herak- les keeps every edible gift for himself, leaving nothing to Hermes. Hermes therefore  requests that henceforth people will explicitly divide their gifts in two and declare  which part is intended for either of the two gods. Clearly, the ways of the two para- sitoi have parted: one has now definitely developed into the proverbial heavyweight  glutton. The other—though equally interested in food—is and remains the underdog:  hungry Hermes. In no. 72, Hermes is described as being content with milk and honey.  “But not so Herakles.” He demands a lamb, or a fat ram, and always selects a piece  of sacrificial meat (θύος) as his own portion. On the other hand, the special portion  for Hermes as opposed to a meaty dish is spelled out in Anth. Pal. VI 299, where a  peasant treats a statue of Hermes to grapes, a piece of cake, figs, olives, a rind of soft  cheese, flour, a heap of grated hard cheese, and a sip of wine, all ingredients of the  average peasant meal. After this, he promises to sacrifice (ῥέξειν φημί) a goat at the  sea-shore. Am I too suspicious if I fear that the statue (probably a herm, as usually  in these epigrams) receives the customary human parts but that—in his statuesque  form—he will never even see the meaty parts? 172 Some recent literature on this much-discussed passage: Kadletz 1984; Petro- poulou 1987; Clay 1989, 124–127, whose description and interpretation I gratefully  adopt in what follows. Recently Jaillard 2007, 114–118, contributed a discussion in  which he emphasizes the strong similarities between Eumaios’ ‘dish’ and the ‘sacrifi- cial’ scene in the Hymn to Hermes, ranging both among the categories of trapezomata  and theoxenia. On the figure and social status of Eumaios see: W.G. Thalmann, The  Swineherd and the Bow: Representations of Class in the Odyssey (Ithaca – London  1998) 84–100. 173 On this term see: S. Saïd, Études de littérature ancienne (Paris 1979) 17–22;  G. Berthiaume, Les rôles du mageiros (Leiden 1982) 50 f. Clay herself also refers to Kahn  </page> <page sequence="60"> 368 chapter four the sense of a human communal meal, Clay 1989, 121 f., even based  herself on the Homeric scene. Here are the main data. The pious  Eumaios slaughters a pig in honour of his new guest, the disguised  Odysseus. There is a prayer to ‘all the gods’ and a modest Olympian  fire sacrifice with burnt meat wrapped in fat and sprinkled with barley  meal. The rest of the meat is chopped up, skewered on spits, roasted,  removed from the spits and tossed onto the ‘cook’s table’ (βάλλον δ'  εἰν ἐλεοῖσιν 432).174 Next the host carves and distributes the cooked  meat into seven portions, “of which he placed (θῆκεν) one, with a  prayer, for the Nymphs and for Hermes,175 and distributed the rest to  the company.” For Odysseus is the portion of honour. Before starting  the meal Eumaios sacrifices the argmata176 to the gods and makes a  libation of wine. So, whereas the other gods receive their canonical offering of burnt  meat as a preliminary to the feast, Hermes is counted as one of the  guests invited to take part in the dais eise177—the role in which we have  1978, 65: “Hermès traite donc le groupe divin comme une communauté humaine.”  Cf. on the element of equality during the dais also: P.

Deoudi, Ithake: Die Polis-Höhle, Odysseus und die  Nymphen (Thessaloniki 2008). 176 On these argmata see: Kadletz 1984. Petropoulou 1987 argues that these ἄργματα  are ἀπαρχαί, which is probable, but her thesis that all elements of Eumaios’ sacrifice  are—in various different ways—‘first fruits offerings’ is less convincing. The notion of  argmata may return in the term maschalismata in the Phrearrioi lex sacra. See for full  discussion in NGSL 166 ff. 177 “Hermes participates in the human dais”: thus Clay, who connects this with  the proverbial wisdom mentioned by Plutarch, De garrul. 502: “whenever a sudden  silence falls during a meeting or an assembly, people say that Hermes has come in.”  On Kahn’s 1978, 184 misinterpretation of this proverb, see W. Hübner, Hermes als  </page> <page sequence="61">  a god: why is hermes hungry? 369 seen him before in fable and legend. This implies an intimate com- mensality between the giver and the intended recipient, as it still can  (or until recently could) be found in Greece.178 Semonides (Fr. 20 W),  quoted by a scholiast ad loc., does not even shrink from writing θύουσι  Νύμφαις τˑ τε Μαιάδος τόκˎż οȿτοι γὰρ ἀνδρῶν αἷμ’ ἔχουσι ποιμένων  (“They bring their offering to the Nymphs and the son of Maia. For  these have the blood of shepherd men”). This is so bloody ‘intimate’  that generations of scholars have been fussing around with all sorts of  conjectures and West, who does retain the manuscript reading, at last  gives in by translating: “for they’re of shepherd stock.” Indeed, even  if the reference to blood is a metaphor, the expression still remains  dangerously daring, blood being as basic a marker of the differences  between gods and men as is the diet. The very human type of com- mensality in the Eumaios scene may have provoked the unique equa- tion of their body juices. In what way was the divine guest supposed to consume his meal?  Kadletz, not the first to ask this question, suggests that Eumaios may  have planned to place this portion at some herm, since, in his view, the  offering should be equated with the hermaia placed before herms, as  we discussed.179 However, apart from the question whether such herms  did exist in Homer’s time, it should be clear that hermaia are of quite a  different nature than Hermes’ portion at Eumaios’ table. Hermaia are  gifts to the god (and very modest gifts at that) lacking further social  contextualisation, but the scene at Eumaios’ table is one of a  communal  musischer Gott, Philologus 130 (1986) 153–157, espec. 157 n. 20: “Hermes’ sudden,  uncanny, almost demonic, presence attests not only to his patronage of social institu- tions.” Cf. also Petropoulou 1987.  178 See: Jameson 1994, 55. In modern Greece the Panaghia or a Saint may be invited  to take part in the meal. G.A. Megas, Greek Calendar Customs (Athens 19632) 40–45,  informs us that the main dish to adorn the New Year’s Day table is the vassilopitta  (the cake named after St. Basilios, the Saint of New Year’s Day). The current custom is  to cut one piece of the vassilopitta for St. Basilios and the Panagia, often also followed  by slices for one’s own family, the house, the cattle, the poor. All animate beings,  included oxen, goat and mule, will eat their pieces. The Saint is believed to visit every  house during the night. Each household makes ready for his visit: a table remains laid  all night so that he may sit and eat. At the question what people do with St. Basil’s  piece when it appears that it has not been consumed, Angelos Chaniotis, who drew  my attention to this New Years custom, told me: “At least in my family, we ate that  food.” In antiquity such meals may have had their origins in house cults. So: D. Gill,  Trapezomata, HThR 67 (1974) 135 f.; Kadletz 1984, 105. Burkert 1985, 107 mentions  Zeus Philios as an example.  179 Kadletz 1984, 103 ff. </page> <page sequence="62"> 370 chapter four meal, at which Hermes is a guest and receives a portion equal to that  of the other guests.180 That is the focal point; what happened with the  portion after the dinner may be of interest to the modern reader, but  both poet and ancient audience could not care less.181 6. Conclusion Altogether we are now able to answer the question posed in the opening  line of section 5 of this Chapter. No, our poor divine hetairos will not  remain deprived of an occasional bite or two. Apollo even addresses  him as δαιτὸς ἑταɛρε (“companion of the feast,” H.Hermes 436),  perfectly understandable now in light of the Eumaios scene. How- ever, surveying the total culinary mishmash we can be more precise.  From early archaic poetry (Homer) via late archaic and early classical  sources (the hymn, fables, vase paintings) up to and including clas- sical comedy and contemporary ritual, all descriptions or allusions  180 Cf. Saïd o.c. above (n. 173), 17: “Le ‘partage égal’ dans l’Iliade comme dans  l’Odyssée est d’abord un partage entre égaux. Il ne concerne que les pairs et exclut les  autres.” The term θῆκεν has provoked some discussion. A number of scholars take it  in a pregnant meaning as “he set apart” (e.g. Kadletz 1981, 103 ff.; Petropoulos 1987,  140, 142; Jaillard 2007, 116). This may entail the idea that the god’s portion undergoes  a different treatment from that of the other guests, as we just saw in the suggested  deposition at a herm. Others propose that the god’s portion was placed at a special tra- peza, as in a private theoxenia. Petropoulou 1987, 143, “the object of Eumaeus’ θῆκεν  is a portion of roast pork that is served up on the table for a group of deities invited  as divine guests amidst the company of mortals,” leaves the matter nicely undecided.  Jaillard 2007, 116 n. 93, agrees: “Il n’est donc pas nécessaire qu’il y ait une table spéci- fique.” In the case of Hermes most likely the meat was placed on the same table of the  other (human) guests. Hermes is a table mate par excellence.  181 Jameson 1994, 37: “The fate of offerings in the world of men, once they have  been consecrated to the gods either by burning or by deposition in a sacred place (such  as sacred table) was of secondary importance or even indifference. Neither concern or  lack of concern with what happens to them is inherent in the action, as comparative  evidence shows.” It is highly unlikely that a piece of tasty meat, such as the other table  mates received as well, should have been deposited outside the house to be snatched  by dogs, foxes or whatever other interested starveling. Most probably the host himself  ate it at a later stage as still in Greece (see n. 178). Cf. Veyne 2000, 16, who translates  “Il mit de côté” (wrongly in my view) and surmises that Eumaios kept it for himself  to eat next day (rightly in my view). The odd consideration that Hermes, being a god,  had already enjoyed his part of the burnt meat (and argmata)—hence should not  be hungry anymore—was, I guess, one of the reasons for G.P. Shipp, Studies in the  Language of Homer2 (Cambridge 1972) 340 to reject these lines as spurious. That is  just another misunderstanding of Hermes’ culinary position. So rightly A. Hoekstra  comm. ad loc. Of Kadletz’ observation “At any rate, the portion set aside for Hermes  and the nymphs is a separate offering [destined for such a deposition] and does not  constitute part of the sacrifice made to the gods” the last part is right, while the first,  as I argued, is less likely.  </page> <page sequence="63">  a god: why is hermes hungry? 371 share one  central message, namely that from a culinary perspective  Hermes never behaves in a decent Olympian fashion. On the contrary,  he always seems to forget that he is a god, consistently crossing the  border and landing on the human side. As a guest in the house of a  mortal host he partakes in human meals; as a herm in streets and at  market places he is regaled with titbits of all kinds of human foodstuff,  as the eternal attendant at sacrificial ceremonies he either remains an  insatiate spectator or, if allowed a share, his helping is a human’s por- tion. Even in the one and only allusion to his partaking of a god’s  portion, the thulemata, he does not eat them processed according to  divine taste. Mortally allergic to knise, so it seems, Hermes gulps them  down before they can be transformed into food for the gods, just as,  reversely, he once transformed the immortal cattle into mortal cows  by killing and preparing them for a dish or dais. If now, armed with these insights, we return to the sacrificial scene in  the Homeric Hymn, we are reminded of the curious paradox which has  been in the focus of attention in recent scholarship. Initially, Hermes  was hankering after flesh. Yet, he roasted it, chopped it up, and distrib- uted it as a geras for the (twelve) gods. In spite of this, the meat destined  for the gods is called hosie kreaôn, that is: sacrificial meat released for  human consumption. Nonetheless, “the sweet savour wearied him, god  though he was.” Still, he did not “gulp it down his throat.” Generally,  the latter token of inhibition is attributed to his sudden awareness that  eating roasted meat would disqualify him as a god. I do not object, but  this does not alter the fact that just a few lines earlier in the very same  context Hermes himself must have assumed that the Olympian gods  do like roasted meat. Why else treat them to a chateaubriand à point?  Now, you cannot have your cake and eat it too (with apologies for the  mess this is making of the menu). There are just too many ‘althoughs’  and ‘yets’ and ‘despites’ in the whole story. No interpretation, neither  the (reversed) sacrifice theory, nor that of the dais eïse, can cope with  all of them. Both theories are left with the same problem that, although  Hermes may be a great lover of roasted meat, the Olympian gods are  not, as the poet himself emphatically reminds the listener/reader with  his helpful note: “god though he was.” In particular if one relies as  heavily on Eumaios’ dais as Clay does, one cannot ignore that the   culinary distinctions between 1) the other Olympians, 2) Hermes and  3) the mortal table-companions determine Eumaios’ whole distributive  system. And as Homer expressly comments: Eumaios for one knew a  thing or two about how to entertain gods and men (14.433: περὶ γὰρ  φρεσὶν αἴσιμα ɶδη). Nor is this the end of the confusion in the hymn.  </page> <page sequence="64"> 372 chapter four After renouncing a taste of the meat, Hermes (134) collects what is left:  “the fat and all the flesh” and “puts it away placing it high up in the  high-roofed byre.” Is this not a splendid instance of the human privi- lege of ἐκφορά (‘take away allowed’)? Altogether the whole jumble leaves room for only one honest con- clusion: though it betrays features of both, the scene in the hymn rep- resents neither a sacrifice nor a dais as we know them from epigraphic  or literary sources. The impression—whether intended by the author  or not—is that Hermes seems to be completely unaware of the prevail- ing dietary codes, mixing them up by treating the Olympian gods to a  human dinner and thus projecting his own predilection for a steak à  la humaine onto the world of the gods. Just as, later in the hymn, he  errs in his expectations about the type of utopian wealth awaiting him  in the gods’ abode, which do not fit Olympian conditions either, as we  discussed above p. 325. Viewed in this perspective, all this is a perfect mythical metaphor  of the god’s cultic status in everyday life. The so-called sacrifice in  the hymn could be pictured in such an ironic, ambiguous and indeed  deranging fashion because the favourite refreshments of the god in  daily cult and their reflections in literature themselves were marked  by the same ironic ambiguity. I am not arguing that the sacrificial  scene of the hymn is deliberately designed as such a reflection. Suffice  it to observe that the passage conveys the very same message through  very similar means. Myth here seems to allude to (cultic) reality just  as more directly fable and comedy did. They all play with the raven- ous appetite of Hermes, a boulimia that, as far as I know, has worried  only one commentator.182 The overwhelming impact of this theme in  such a variety of literary sources seems to have found its inspiration  in the fact that Hermes both as a herm—a shape becoming ubiquitous  in the same period in which the hymn was produced—attending, but  182 Haft 1996, who sees it as a corollary of the ephebic cattle-raiding ritual which in  her view is the ritual cradle of the god’s mythology. One may also see it as a charac- teristic of the trickster, a mythical figure with which Hermes is often identified (Burk- ert 1985, 156). Tricksters, such as the modern Greek Karageosis, are notorious for  their culinary greed. Cf. Bierl 1994, 36. We have seen (above n. 171) that the Greeks  themselves had already observed his similarities with Herakles in this respect. Once  more, I wish to emphasize that it is not my purpose to cast doubt on such theories of  origin. My aim is to trace the socio-historical niche of the lasting and indeed increas- ing predominance and ubiquity of the image of the never satisfied glutton in the god  Hermes. </page> <page sequence="65">  a god: why is hermes hungry? 373 not partaking in sacrifices for other gods, being instead regaled on  little titbits which, however, he had to share with ‘eaters of Hekataia’,  and as a regular table mate is always hungry, as contemporary literary  texts emphasize. It was our focus on the culinary aspects that enabled us to expose  Hermes’ curiously ungodly behaviour. There is no more appropriate  marker of cultural distinctions than diets, including the concomitant  table manners. But Hermes’ culinary ‘status aparte’ is only one expo- nent of the universal singularity of his ‘Sitz im Leben’. His deviant  addiction to mixing up human and divine codes far transcends his  interest in foodstuff. In vase paintings he is often depicted as leading  a sacrificial victim in a procession or bringing sacrifice himself (LIMC  796–822), thus playing the human, in his most essentially human  role. More generally, Hermes nearly always acts in a human man- ner, not—like other gods—relying on autonomous and innate divine  power or qualities. To actualize his typical abilities such as working  magic, making himself invisible, moving swiftly to and fro, and prac- tising his—modest—oracular capacities, he needs tools just as a mortal  would:183 a magic rod, his magical hood, the winged shoes, the bees.  The hymn gives an explicit account of the gradual acquisition of these   instruments. His sole truly immanent and innate quality, the only one with which  he was born as again the hymn so emphatically sketches, is best illus- trated by his contribution to the construction of Pandora: a shameless  mind, lies and crafty words, and a deceitful disposition (Hes. E. 67–78).  In more positive terms, it is his metis, a quality indispensable for socio- economic survival. It implies cunning, eloquence and, if need be, theft,  cheating, even including swearing a false oath and getting away with  it. Versatile, that is how Hermes advertises himself in the long passage  in Ar. Plut. 1100–1170, where the starving god, deploring the loss of  all the goodies he used to receive from his human worshippers, tries  to persuade them to accept him as a fellow-inhabitant of their world  (ἀλλὰ ξύνοικον, πρὸς θεῶν, δέξασθέ με). He lists the (human) quali- ties in which he can be useful to his mortal companions, as strophaios  (door guardian); as empolaios (businessman), as dolios (deceiver),  as hegemonios (guide), as enagonios (president of the games). The  183 The gods’ need for such typically human tools were of course grist for the mill  of Christian criticism. See for several testimonies: Ch. V n. 128. </page> <page sequence="66"> 374 chapter four  reaction of his discussion partner is: 1164: “How good is it to have so  many epithets” (ὡς ἀγαθόν ἐστ’ ἐπωνυμίας πολλάς ἔχειν), after which  Hermes is accepted as synoikos. It is his versatility as expressed in his  polyonymy that earns him his living among mortal men. Polytropos in  ancient Greek,184 poneros in modern Greek,185 that is Hermes, a model  for his mortal analogon.186 May we claim to have discovered the ‘essential’ Hermes? No, we  may not for such a Hermes did not exist. Many different divine per- sons might shelter under one name as we saw in our first chapter.  And Hermes is no exception. Just as Zeus Meilichios was not the  same as Zeus Basileus, so was the Hermes Chthonios, known from  curse tablets and funerary inscriptions in Thessaly187 with his fixed  abode in the underworld, another person than the Hermes pantokra- tor that we shall meet in the next chapter. What we have found is  the ‘little Hermes’, largely disregarded in modern scholarship, but  very much alive in the everyday imagery and experience of ancient  Greeks. They appreciated him as the prototypical companion of man:  hetairos, a temporary fellow-dweller according to legend and myth,  a welcome table mate in legend and cult, a permanent and loyal  house-mate—theos  geiton188—in the cultic shape of the herm. As a  184 Hermes is often compared with Odysseus: W.G. Thalmann, Conventions of Form  and Thought in Early Greek Epic Poetry (Baltimore 1984) 174 ff.; C.A.

The term polytropos occurs twice as an epithet of Odysseus in Od.  1.1; 10.330 (the last time as spoken by Hermes), and twice of Hermes in his hymn,  13 and 439. Cf. Pucci o.c. index s.v.

Both are marked by rapid changes in the flow of events, but the first is  master and plays with the circumstances, the second is subject and plaything. What we  have discovered is that Hermes is both, which makes him all the more human. 187 A. Avagianou, ȋρμῆι ƙθονίωι.

The only well-developed member of  his body not sufficing to compensate the lack of all others, the god may  create a suggestion of helplessness, in the fable playing the dupe or the  plaything, as—not yet troubled by any bodily handicap—he was will- ing to do already in Homeric scenes. But, on the other hand, he is also  the resourceful survivor who will always re-emerge through his inge- nious guile. In myth and fable a—not always successful—distributor  of equal parts, in real life the god of the hermaia becomes a dispenser  of unexpected bits of luck in human life. In sum: to say that Hermes is  the most human among the Olympians would be an understatement.  It would make him an extreme on a sliding scale, for, indeed, no god  can live without a fair dash of human features, affects, psychology and  physiology, as we shall discuss in the next chapter. Hermes, however,  is different. Both in cultic reality and in various descriptions of his  presence in the human world he seems to transmute into a human  being, fellow human and fellow sufferer, if the reader will condone  these terms coined in recent Christian theology. If it is true in general—as I believe it is—that, in the words of Paul  Veyne quoted before, “a worshipper who made a vow in pious affec- tion did not think of the mythological biography of the god to whom  he prayed for assistance. But if questioned he would speak on this  mythical aspect,” then it is eminently true for Hermes. In the mate- rial adduced in the present chapter there is practically no trace of the  magician, the herdsman, the psychopompos, only a few of the kerux,  the thief. Even his central function of intermediary between divine  and human worlds, as in his roles of messenger of the gods, revealer  of divine knowledge, intermediary in sacrificial ritual, though always  available on demand, are curiously underexposed. These aspects are  not denied but remain out of range. To find them in more explicit  elaboration one must consult different types of evidence and discourse:  the more fancy vase paintings with mythological themes, particularly  the ones with groups of gods, literary genres such as tragedy, philoso- phy and most of all mythology. This is once more—and for the last time—best illustrated by a charm- ing picture of hungry Hermes in the same piece of literature where  we found the god at the table of a herdsman. In the fifth book of the  Odyssey Zeus sends Hermes to Kalypso. The goddess (expressly called  so 92; 97) regales him with a dish of nektar and ambrosia. Hermes  tells her that his trip over the seas had been less than pleasant since  </page> <page sequence="68"> 376 chapter four there is no city of mortals who offer to the gods sacrifice and choice  hekatombs. So: hungry again, but in this context quite satisfied with  a genuine Olympian repast even though he still does not get his sniff  of burnt hekatombs. After his departure Kalypso places Odysseus on  the chair that Hermes has left, places all kinds of food for him “that  mortal men eat,” but helps herself to nektar and ambrosia (195–200).  The poet saw fit to make clear distinctions here. This time, contrary  to everything we have observed in the present chapter, we do not see  a god descending into the world of men, but we perceive the world of  gods in which a mortal being has intruded. And the culinary rules are  adjusted to the situation. The Homeric Hymn, belonging to the realm of myth, naturally pays  attention to the most important of Hermes’ functions and roles. Yet,  this does not seem to be its central message. The focus is not on ‘func- tion’, nor even on ‘meaning’ but on character. And in this respect the  hymn is deeply affected and informed by the nature of Hermes in every- day social life as we have encountered it. Born ‘in between’, from the  union between the father of gods and men and the unmarried maiden  (nymphe) Maia, a baby in a barren grotto, wrapped in swaddling clothes  and lying in a cradle, the god works miracles on the first day of his  life. Though aspiring to a place of honour on Olympus he behaves as  a human being throughout the hymn, and, after having obtained his  recognition as a god, returns to the world where he was born, the world  of men, to perform human tasks like herding and bartering, and “con- sorting with all mortals and immortals.” In that order. In Ar. Plutus  1148, the bewildered Karion asks: “Do you indeed wish to leave the gods  and settle here below?” (ἀπολιπὼν τοɞς θεοɞς ἐνθάδε μενεῖς;). And, yes,  that is what Hermes indeed desires. “Consorting with all mortals and  immortals”, yet, ultimately “settling here below.” The unpublished Ital- iote situla from Foggia that we mentioned earlier, shows the god Hermes  standing on a chariot, carrying a herm—the image in which his closest  companionship with human beings was most manifest—in his arms.189  This seems to me a perfect ideogram of the god Hermes. 189 See above n. 98. </page> <page sequence="69">  a god: why is hermes hungry? 377 10 11 12 13 </page> </plain_text>
