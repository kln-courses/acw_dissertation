<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> C H A P T E R  3 Natural Motion Logos in the Physics We are still trying to get a firm hold on the meaning of the phrase “logos of  being” in Aristotle’s Categories. In chapter 1, we argued that there logos means  “standard”; in chapter 2, we noticed that this standard must be inherent and  exhibit this inherence in the interrelation of actuality and potentiality, that  is, in internally motivated beings, in natural beings. Thus we are now led to  investigate Aristotle’s philosophy of nature. In section 1 we elaborate the  Aristotelian notion of a “theoretical” natural scientist and of a correspond- ingly “spectacular” nature that exhibits the inherent character of its logos in  motion. In section 2 we focus on living beings and their motions: nutri- tion and reproduction. We shall see that these two motions introduce a new  meaning of logos: since they involve the integration of matter into the “form  according to logos” within the living being’s body (in nutrition) or outside  it (in reproduction), this new meaning of logos can roughly be expressed by  “ratio.” But, in section 3, we shall note that not all meanings of logos denote  the integration of matter according to Aristotle, and thus we shall set the  stage for the elaboration of two other kinds of natural motion in chapter 4 on  animal life: sensation and locomotion. 1. The Natural What does logos have to do with nature? “Nature loves to hide itself,” says Heraclitus in fragment 123. When we  are bitten by a dog, when an earthquake destroys houses and crushes thou- sands of lives, when we are struck by a virus, when we imagine a meteor  hitting the Earth, it seems like all this happens on the background of the  terrifying and yet essential ambient silence of the forces of nature. We may  well speak about nature, translate, interpret, or represent it, voice its claims  and defend or subjugate it. But it seems that, however much we try, we will  always be the ones who lend voice to it, who discuss our own interpretation  63 </page> <page sequence="2"> 64 chapter 3 and understanding of it, who defend or reject one another’s claim about that  demand. Aristotle himself most famously proclaims: “Of animals, only the  human being possesses logos” (Pol. I, 1, 1253a10– 11). So, this seems to be the  dilemma of human alienation from nature: either we dominate nature and  control a servant indifferent to our command, the blind force of nature, or  else we are subjected to a deaf master that does not and even cannot ask for  our obedience. How can we ever approach nature neither as the compliant or  resistant, but in any case blind, material of human undertakings, nor as the  merciless and yet irrational avenger of the hubris of us mortals? How can  we ever approach nature beyond categories of subjugation and use, neither as  master nor as our servant? This is our first question. Logos is said in many ways. But if there is anything common to these vari- ous meanings, it may be that all may denote something “unnatural.” We are  not unfamiliar with thinking that nature is fundamentally alogos unless we  find a certain logic to it, unless we understand it, unless we give some form,  voice, and meaning to it. In fact, the specifically human vocation may well  be thought to be this imposition of meaning on the meaningless. Hence our  second question: how are we to make sense of Aristotle’s definition of nature  precisely in terms of logos? This chapter of the book proposes to offer a solution to both of the ques- tions above. In this chapter, we shall work out two major occurrences of  logos in Aristotle’s philosophy of nature: first, logos in Aristotle’s definition  of nature as “form according to logos” in Physics II, 1, 193a31 and 193b3, and  secondly logos in his understanding of organic nature, that is, living beings, as  a logos of growth, in On the Soul II, 4, 416a10ff.1 We shall show how and why  nature is defined in terms of logos for Aristotle, and argue that, according to  him, natural beings stretch out to put up their own show and to express their  “logic.”2 In laws, legislators unduly forbid children from stretching and  crying, for these are useful for growth since in this way a bodily  exercise happens; because holding breath produces strength against  hardships, which is what happens to children when they stretch  themselves. (Pol. VII, 15, 1336a34– 39) According to Aristotle, natural beings are essentially “spectacular” before  being the dull and malleable material of human impositions or our sublime  but silent retaliator. Accordingly, Aristotle’s natural scientist is neither a voy- eur watching nature through a keyhole, nor a colonizer in search of natural  resources, nor a crafty experimenter settled in a laboratory registering results.  </page> <page sequence="3"> natural motion 65 He is rather a theoretical person— more precisely, a theôros, an envoy sent out  of his city to consult an oracle, to ask for a logos and to watch rituals, games,  or tragedies.3 Overall, we wish to awaken a sense of the natural scientist as a  “theorist” and a listener attentive and responsive to the “spectacular” charac- ter of vociferating natural beings.4 Nature In order to do this, we must try to momentarily bracket dualities that set  up nature against something else such as “human beings,” “history,” “cul- ture,” or “nurture,” simply because we do not find such dualities in Aristotle.5  For, according to him, nature itself is not a section of beings as opposed to  another. Nature is not a pragma, it is not even a being (on) or a “substance”  (ousia) in the sense of an individual thing (tode ti).6 To put it in terms foreign  to Aristotle, nature is much less a being than the being of beings.7 Nature is  not even a general name for the totality of natural beings. If nature appears  at all, there is something “else” that appears “besides” nature. Perhaps this is  the sense in which it “loves to hide itself ” according to Heraclitus. “Every  thing that has a nature is a being, since it is something that underlies, and  nature is always in an underlying being” (Ph. II, 1, 192b33–3 4).8 Then nature  is never clear and distinct in the sense of being separated, isolated, or even  isolatable. Nature is never over against, but under. Or rather, it is always in  something (en hypokeimenôi), is essentially responsible for something (aition)  or the source of something (arkhê). These emphatic “in,”“for,” and “of” all appear in the major Aristotelian  definition of nature: “Nature is a source of and cause for being moved and  coming to rest in that to which it belongs primarily” (Ph. II, 1, 192b21– 23;  emphasis is ours). Nature is the source of and cause for motion in moving  beings. Natural beings, instead of constituting the realm of nature, are by  nature and according to nature: According to nature [kata physin] are both these things [an underly- ing thing and a being] and as many things as belong to these in  virtue of themselves, just as being carried up belongs to fire. For  this is not a nature, nor does it have a nature, but is by nature [phy- sei] and according to nature [kata physin]. (Ph. II, 1, 192b35– 193a2;  emphases are ours)9 Aristotle systematically and emphatically distinguishes nature itself from  natural beings or naturally oriented processes, without suggesting that nature  is apart and away from them. Whatever the true meaning of this distinction  </page> <page sequence="4"> 66 chapter 3 between nature and natural beings, his examples for natural beings are “ani- mals and their parts, plants, and the simple bodies (like earth, fire, air, and  water)” (Ph. II, 1, 192b9– 11). Aristotle defines nature not in terms of life and soul, but in terms of motion  and rest. If it is possible at all to talk about logos in nature, we then must get  a hold of Aristotle’s understanding of motion. Motion is not only among the  few central concepts in Aristotle’s philosophy, it is the Aristotelian concept  that has been fundamentally modified, if not altogether rejected and aban- doned, by early modern science. However counterintuitive it might seem, in  order to grasp Aristotle’s concept of motion, we must first clarify and undo  both post- Aristotelian and anti-A ristotelian conceptions of motion.10 But  we cannot simply do away with them, we must understand how they are post-  Aristotelian and anti-A ristotelian. More exactly, we must be able to have a  sense of the historical sedimentation of the concept of motion in order to  work our way through the early modern rejection of Aristotelian cosmology  towards that which they rejected. Since this is a task we cannot even claim  to attempt in the context of this book, what follows is a very rough attempt  to undo four interconnected reductions made in the early modern era pre- cisely against the Aristotelianism of that time: (a) the reduction of causality  to material causation, (b) the reduction of hylê to matter, (c) the reduction  of motion to locomotion, and (d) the reduction of kosmos to infinite space.11  Thus, we shall be able to recover Aristotle’s concept of motion, grasp his defi- nition of nature, and understand the function of logos therein. Undoing Physics A. The Reduction of Causality to Material Causation. To begin with, Aristo- tle’s word for “cause,” aition, comes from aitia, which means “responsibility”:  it means “guilt, blame, charge, fault” in a bad sense, and in a good sense  “credit” or even “reputation.”12 Pretty much like the term pragma mentioned  in the previous chapters, aitia is also used in the sense of “case in dispute,”  and in the dative it means “for the sake of something.” The word aitia itself  comes from the verb aitiaomai, which again highlights the pejorative: “to  accuse.” In light of this partial semantic field, all our mechanical cause- effect  relationships appear faceless, impersonal, and irresponsible. Aition in Ancient  Greek has clear ethical-p olitical connotations and brings to mind the idea of  a definite agent who has committed a certain act, an agent who had an inten- tion and who now has a certain face and a name. The reason why aition in Ancient Greek appears much more human, ethi- cal, legal, conscious, or responsible than what we understand by the word  “cause” is that early modern philosophy has precisely criticized, reduced, and  </page> <page sequence="5"> natural motion 67 finally rejected this anthropomorphism. It is precisely by making the concept  of “cause” less personal, less idiosyncratic, less capricious, less singular, and  less interested, and more impersonal, more “objective,” formal, universal, and  quantitative, that early modern philosophers hoped to make causality a realm  of better prediction and higher precision. Schematically speaking, there are  four kinds of causes in Aristotle: firstly “matter” (hylê), secondly “the first  beginning of motion” (protê arkhê kinêseôs), thirdly “form” (eidos), and fourthly  the “end” (telos) (Ph. II, 3; Metaph. V, 2). Again schematically speaking, mod- ern science seems to have rejected the latter two. Thus, by reducing causality  to a relationship of matter in motion, early modern physics deprived causality  of the face it had, of the name it bore, and of the intention that subtended it. B. The Reduction of Hylê to “Matter.” Deprived of “form” and “end,” both  “matter” and “source of motion” come to be fundamentally modified. For  instance, in Homer (Odyssey V, 257), hylê meant less mere “stuff ” than “the  stuff of which a thing is made,” that is, a material for a chair, of a spear, in a bird  nest.13 Hence hylê often meant a definite kind of material: “wood,” “timber,”  or “forest trees” in distinction from dendra, “fruit trees,” as can be seen in the  English word “xylophone.”14 But hylê also came to mean something in direct  opposition to timber trees prepared for the carpenter: “copse,” “brushwood,”  “undergrowth.” Finally, already in Homer again, hylê meant “forest” (Iliad XI,  115; Odyssey XVII, 316). Just as the meaning of aitia grounds our conception of cause, but is sig- nificantly larger, more concrete, and more personal, hylê too offers a wider  range of senses than our concept of “matter.” For Aristotle “even hylê is a  source” (Metaph. IX, 1, 1046a24). Even hylê generates and governs beings,  and is responsible for some beings. It is their source just like nature is. Just as  nature is responsible for something, hylê is material for something. As “under- growth,” hylê is not indeterminate stuff, a pure res extensa, but is determined  as falling short of an inherent standard of growth because it is thought in  terms of growth. Hylê means undergrowth, but also undergrowth.15 In short, early modern philosophy understood matter as deprived of form  and end, and thus as homogenous. For Descartes, matter is res extensa. The  substantia of his famous piece of wax is not an undergrowth at all; it does  not quite have a name, it does not grow and is not to have any face itself,  but rather, being receptive to all possible faces and conventional names, is  exposed to the inspection of the mind alone. Once reduced to matter and  deprived of form and end, hylê is no longer seen or even imagined, but simply  inspected without having any look to offer itself. To use the terminology of  Hobbes, who literally follows the basic meaning of the Ancient Greek eidos  and the Latin species, once reduced to matter, hylê offers no “visible shew.”16 </page> <page sequence="6"> 68 chapter 3 C. The Reduction of Motion to Locomotion. It is but reasonable that  early modern physics understands motion as motion of this matter deprived  of form (eidos) and end (telos). Schematically speaking, we find four kinds of  motion in Aristotle: change with respect to being, change of quality, change  of quantity, and change with respect to place (Ph. III, 1, 200b33– 34).17 In  early modern science, however, we see that the reduction of causality and  matter entails a reduction of these four kinds of motion. Let us touch upon  each of the four. First, deprived of form and end, matter can no longer change with respect  to its being. For matter as the eternal underlying thing is neither generated  nor perishable.18 Although this idea had a history before Aristotle, going  back to the Atomists and perhaps to Parmenides, its posterity has proven  even more fecund: the Democritean idea of the permanence of matter was  extremely influential, via Lucretius, on early modern rationalism and mate- rialism as well as on early modern physics, and even on the tenets of nascent  thermodynamics and chemistry.19 Secondly, this matter, ungenerated and imperishable, deprived of form  and end, can no longer change with respect to quality either. For it is not and  cannot be informed, but only shaped, and this shape can have no intrinsic  unity because, being homogenous, the “parts” of matter are indifferent to one  another. There is no intrinsic difference between one cubical body and many  bodies happening to form together a cube. Thirdly, the motion of a piece of matter cannot be a change with respect  to quantity for the same reason. For again there is no intrinsic difference  between a body of a certain magnitude and a certain number of different  bodies adding up to the same magnitude. The only thing that counts for this  body is its mass, but even so, there is no intrinsic difference between one body  weighing three kilos and three bodies weighing one kilo each. The difference  that counts for early modern physics is, say, between one body weighing one  kilo and one weighing three kilos. But what does “one” mean here, if not  an arbitrary imposition of the subject?20 Qualitatively and quantitatively, the  whole is nothing more than the sum of its parts—e xcept our own externally  imposed arbitrary conceptions. Thus, finally, no longer being generated or destroyed, no longer really  changing with respect to quality or quantity, homogenous matter can only  undergo a change with respect to place. And indeed, together with mass,  typical Newtonian physics is solely concerned with distance, that is, dis- tance between “places,” topoi. But although Aristotle himself proclaims that  change with respect to place is the most prominent kind of motion (Ph. IV,  14, 223b21– 22; VII, 2, 243a11; VIII, 7), the early modern notion of “place”  </page> <page sequence="7"> natural motion 69 looks extremely different than Aristotelian topos.21 For it is not “measured”  according to itself, but with respect to its distance to other “places” which are  in fact no more “measured” according to themselves. D. The Reduction of Kosmos to Infinite Space. Then we must turn to the  reduction of topos. Early modern physics, and especially the Cartesian coor- dinate system, replace the Aristotelian concept of “place”22 with “position”  or “location,” because here “places” are no longer contained within a finite  universe (to pan) having a certain order (kosmos).23 All “places” are instead  distributed throughout an “infinite” environment and thus are determined  only relatively, that is, with respect to other positions.24 Position and location  are truly adequate terms to be contrasted with the Ancient Greek topos and  the Latin locus in so far as the former two emphasize the subjective activity of  locating, positing according to its own relative locatedness or positedness. Thus, as motion is reduced to locomotion in early modern science, the  loci of this locomotion are also made strictly homogenous. Hence, according  to what will be known as the “law of inertia,” a moving body would move  indefinitely in the same direction simply because it is already moving in that  direction. Matter has no intrinsic “inclination” (hormê, as in Ph. II, 1, 192b18)  with respect to its position, location, or direction.25 Just as a body is not  intrinsically related to its own parts in early modern mechanistic physics, it is  also indifferent to its environment. Homogenous matter moves in a homog- enous environment with no “center,” no “periphery,” no “up,” no “down,” no  “limit,” and no “threshold.” This infinite environment of matter in motion is  indeed not a universe or an “all” (to pan) in the sense of a finite and ordered  whole (kosmos),26 but is something that is by definition never an “all.”27 Thus  such an environment is altogether foreign to Aristotelian physics and is des- ignated with a term that has no equivalent there: “space.”28 So if we are to understand motion in Aristotle and thereby find an answer  to our question, that is, the inherence of logos in natural motion, we must  recall a sense of aition as a “responsible” having a certain look (eidos) and  being motivated by an “intention” (telos), we must think of hylê as having a  certain “directionality” as undergrowth. Thus we must see motion and change  not as the transitory external modifications of an intrinsically homogenous  eternal underlying matter, but as something happening to something, some- thing suffering under something, and even something done by something to  itself.29 We must reinstate matter, mortality, earthliness, and finitude in the  Aristotelian sublunar nature. Finally, we must somehow picture a differenti- ated, multiple, and heterogeneous universe where bodies are in places not  simply because they are actually there, where bodies are not absent from places  simply because they actually are not there. As prefigured in our two previous  </page> <page sequence="8"> 70 chapter 3 discussions, we shall see a sense of “stretch” and “tension” become more and  more concrete in this chapter of the book, and more and more diverse in the  following ones. For Aristotle, nature as aition or arkhê is then not an initial push or stimu- lation; it is comparable to a stretch that from the end (telos) of a process  reaches back to its beginning and permeates and informs the whole change;  matter is stretched out toward the mature, multiple, and settled life of a forest,  as fire is stretched away from the center of the universe towards its place. In  short, while elaborating Aristotle’s concept of nature, we must keep in mind  that an inherent back-t urning stretch pervades nature, and that, according to  him, “place has some power” (Ph. IV, 1, 208b10– 11).30 Everyday “Physics” If we are to employ Aristotle’s typical procedure from what is clear to us,  we may ask what is clear to us in the context of causality, matter, motion,  and spatiality.31 Perhaps dismantling the early modern reductions brings  us less to an even more remote era of history than to what is already clear  to us as living beings and involved human agents. Perhaps as theôroi who  have left our town, each and every day we are in touch with an experiential  sense of motion that lies beneath the way motion is taught in high school,  measured and calculated from a third-p erson perspective. Indeed, scientific  technical concepts such as cause, motion, matter, mass, and space have been  historically derived from more concrete human experiences, as can be seen  sometimes from their etymology, and yet this means that becoming aware of  these formalizations and abstractions does not simply lead us further away  from our time back to the primitive and prescientific, but also that such an  awareness brings us critically back to our concrete human experience.32 What then is our experiential sense of causality, matter, motion, and spa- tiality? We are beings who cause change in the world and who move all our  life or who assume to be doing so. When we move around or cause changes  in the world, we very often do so with a certain purpose in mind. When we  ask a question such as “Why is the coffee maker in the bathroom?” the kind  of explanation we expect is not: “Because that is exactly where it is located”  or “Because it has been put there.” Such answers are uninformative, if not  redundant, and hence would be immediately followed by another question:  “Who put it there? Why?” In this process of asking, we are seeking neither an  account of the beginning of motion in the universe as a whole, nor the very  last proximate force that finally pushed or pulled the coffee maker to where it  is now. Rather, we are after the “whole point” or the “overarching story” that  we assume to be subtending the situation, we are trying to see the face of the  </page> <page sequence="9"> natural motion 71 disfigured state of affairs, we are trying to recognize what is going on. We are  familiar with both the bathroom and the coffee maker, but the meaning of  their relationship is riddlesome. Something seems out of place. Thus, we can keep asking questions, and as long as the answers we get  give us more proximate causes of motion, we will be unsatisfied, for “it must  stop somewhere” (Metaph. XII, 3, 1070a4). If our interlocutor is expounding  on the respective positions of the coffee maker in space, we are getting some  answers, but no account, explanation, or justification—no logos in the sense  of the relation holding together the formerly disparate terms. We are lacking  a middle term between the bathroom and the coffee maker. When asking  about the cause of the coffee maker’s being in the bathroom, we are not seek- ing information, we are trying to understand. We are looking not for another  “cause” than the ones we are getting, but for another kind of cause. What we seek in our question is the final or formal cause (telos or eidos),  while our reticent interlocutor keeps giving an impoverished version of the  Aristotelian efficient cause.33 If one is asking “Why is the coffee maker in the  bathroom?” then one clearly already knows what a coffee maker and a bath- room are, and thus sees the coffee maker in the bathroom as out of place. This is  evident from the words we are using: a word like “bathroom” does not supply  us spatial coordinates, it does not designate an indefinite anonymous Raum  or space, nor is it a certain space plus certain objects such as a faucet, a tub,  towels . . . A bathroom is rather precisely a room for something, obviously for  taking a bath. It is the activity of taking a bath that first gives all the previous  details a unified aspect or look, because it supplies the connections between  them, it provides the lines of force between them, it connects the points that  turn out not to be points, it sheds light on them no longer as loose objects that  have happened to fall together instantly, but as stretched toward one another  all along. Perhaps it is in this sense that place has, for Aristotle, “a certain  power.” Thus, the eidos or telos is not “news.” While “out of place,” we notice  the coffee maker almost caught red- handed in the bathroom; there it does not  have a show, it is not part of that show, but of another: to “make coffee.” This “experiential logic” of everyday life not only brings us closer to Aris- totle’s Physics, but even foreshadows, perhaps, the most formal parts of the  corpus, namely his syllogistic. For the connection between the disparate ele- ments of our everyday understanding of a bathroom, the “stretch” between  the objects, corresponds to the Aristotelian “middle term” (to meson): it is  the connection that makes us understand the two other terms.34 And while  an unacquainted view of the bathroom may be seen to correspond to the  dogmatic universal statement “All towels stay in the bathroom,” our everyday  implicit understanding is mediated: “Towels are used for taking a bath, and  </page> <page sequence="10"> 72 chapter 3 we take baths in the bathroom, so that’s why they stay in the bathroom.” Of  course, houses and objects are organized in different ways in different cul- tures and according to different people’s taste. Yet, the point here is not that  human places are organized specifically in this or that way and by means of  this or that object, but precisely that human places are organized. And it is only  as organized places that different spatialities in different cultures and in dif- ferent experiences come to be apparent in their very difference. Nature at Work So Aristotle attempts to view causality and motion, as it were, “from  within.”35 Here cause looks less like an external stimulus or a push than like  something “responsible” or “accountable.” Places here look less like locations  with definable coordinates, than like homes, hives, nests, territories, rooms,  hideouts, yards, roads, detours, and resting points. Motion looks less like  happenings, incidences, or occurrences than activities, undergoings, or even  undertakings. This is exactly reflected in the way we would ask in English:  “What is the coffee maker doing in the bathroom?” To draw from the senses  of pragmateuesthai mentioned earlier in chapter 2, motion takes the form of  concern, labor, and care. Hence, for Aristotle, motion is grounded on the idea  of work (ergon) and of an end of that work (telos): “Motion is the actuality  [entelekheia] of that which is potentially just as such” (Ph. III, 1, 201a11–1 2).  If Aristotle defines nature in terms of motion, he defines motion in terms of  actuality: “being-a t- work” (en- ergeia) or “being- at- the- point- of- completion”  (en- telekheia). We are not unaware that natural beings fundamentally differ from artifacts  like coffee makers, and that natural places differ from human space. How- ever, one must not exaggerate this difference; in fact, Aristotle emphasizes  more the parallelism between nature and art than their mutual exclusiveness: Each being comes to be from a synonym— natural beings as well as  the others; for a being is generated either by art, by nature, by for- tune or by chance. Then art is a source in another whereas nature is  a source in [the being] itself. (Metaph. XII, 3, 1070a4– 8) As we have seen in chapter 2, the source of motion in natural beings is inher- ent to them, unlike that of the coffee maker and other artifacts. Natural  beings move not only because of something they may happen to become, but  because of something they already are. If we clarify the meaning of the verb  “being” here, we may get a hold of what is “spectacular” about natural beings,  and of its relation to logos. </page> <page sequence="11"> natural motion 73 What are composite natural beings? Form and matter. Which one gives us  a better grip on their nature, according to Aristotle? After defining nature as  a source or cause of motion and rest in that to which it belongs primarily in  Physics II, 1, 192b21–2 4, Aristotle first takes up the view of nature as the “first  underlying hylê” (193a28–2 9). According to this view, nature is that which a  being boils down to. Aristotle presents Antiphon’s argument: the nature of a  bed is wood, for, if it is buried under the earth for some time, wood remains  even after it loses its shape as a bed. Note how similar this argument is to Des- cartes’s wax example: just as the substantia of the wax was some indeterminate  eternal stuff underlying transient sensory aspects, Antiphon takes nature to  be an unarranged (arrythmiston) underlying being that remains continuous  (diamenei . . . synekhôs) and eternal (aidion) beneath momentary attributes or  affections, states, and dispositions (pathê .  .  . kai hexeis kai diatheseis). What  Antiphon and Descartes abstract is one aspect of their own interest in the  thought experiment: wood cannot be the nature of bed for a viewer who is  about to sleep, and extension cannot be the essence of the piece of wax for  bees. Both experiment and both displace things in their experiment and thus  fail to watch what nature may show. Whereas Descartes famously claims that  man is “maître et possesseur de la nature,”36 Aristotle claims: If human being is the best of all animals, this makes no difference,  for there are many other things that are more divine than human  being, for instance, the most apparent one, those out of which the  kosmos is composed. (NE VI, 7, 1141b1– 1141b3)37 Thus if “logos of being” is a standard inherent to the being at hand, if it truly  is what it is for that being to be, proof of this will be provided by motion, by  natural motion, that is, by motions whose motive force lies within the mov- ing being. Logos and Nature Hence, Aristotle responds to Antiphon’s “downward” account of nature as  hylê in the following way: “What is potentially flesh or bone does not yet  have its own nature  .  .  .” (Ph. II, 1, 193b1–2 ). Before we read the rest of  the passage, note that Aristotle is here reversing Antiphon’s and Descartes’s  perspective: that which can be anything is something that is not according  to nature. Seen “downwardly” as something unarranged that can be arranged  in any way, the buried bed indeed has no nature. Aristotle seems to invite  Antiphon to watch the spectacle a bit longer: in fact, when the bed is buried,  it turns not into indeterminate stuff; having lost its “shape,” it does not return  </page> <page sequence="12"> 74 chapter 3 to unarranged (arrythmiston) disorder, but precisely to another order, its own  order, its own “rhythm,” its inherent determination, its “form according to  logos” (eidos to kata ton logon). Now we can read the whole sentence we partly quoted above: What is potentially flesh or bone does not yet have its own nature,  until it takes the eidos kata ton logon— that by means of which, in  defining, we say what flesh or bone is; and [what is potentially flesh  or bone] is not according to nature. (Ph. 193b1– 4) When the bed is buried and the wood starts to sprout, it takes up its own true  face, it shows its look (eidos), it puts up its own show instead of that imposed  by the carpenter. Buried, the wood is destroyed only in the aspect which inter- ests one who needs a bed. Seen from the perspective of its inherent logos, it is  not destroyed, but rather allowed to be on its own, to put on its own show. As  quickly as Socrates’s body returned to its elements, the piece of wood sprouts  and stretches out toward the look of an oak tree. Even further, it is less the wood  that now reaches ahead to the look of an oak, than it is the show of the oak that  is at last allowed to stretch back toward hylê and take hold of the undergrowth.  The awkwardness of our terms may also be found in Aristotle’s central state- ment in Physics II, 1: “What, then, is it that grows? Not the from-w hich, but  the to- which” (193b18– 19).38 This tension or backward stretch starting from  the to-w hich back to the from-w hich is indeed the link that keeps apart and  holds together potentiality and actuality. “Just as teachers think they deliver up  the end when they have exhibited a student at work, so too is nature” (Metaph.  IX, 8, 1050a18– 19). Instead of burying the bed like Antiphon or burning the  piece of wax like Descartes, instead of first stripping beings down or displacing  them, Aristotle in a way makes himself a theôros by displacing himself in order  to consult nature, to ask for a logos, to watch the spectacle of nature. To recapitulate, for Aristotle nature is primarily an inherent source of  motion— inherent not in the Anaximandrean way the unarranged (arryth- miston) lies beneath rhythmos, or in the way the faceless disorder lies deep  beneath superficial order.39 Rather, nature is inherent as a face waiting to  be allowed to appear, as a show waiting for patience, interest, attention, and  silence from the audience. We add “.  .  .  and some silence” because just as  natural beings are spectacular, their show is not a pantomime, but the articu- lation of their proper logic, the expression of what it is for them to be. Their  face is “the logos of what it is for [them] to be” (Ph. II, 3, 194b27–2 8). It is in  this sense that the inherently motivated motions of natural beings, most nota- bly growth, attest that which we have been looking for since the beginning of  </page> <page sequence="13"> natural motion 75 this book: the “logos of being,” an intrinsic relation between potentiality and  actuality, a genuine claim coming from the very being at hand about its own  being, a true standard of being, that is, an inherent standard. Out of the four basic meanings of logos, namely “standard,” “ratio,” “reason,”  and “speech,” we have now come to understand the first one and accounted  for its inherence: logos as standard. 2. The Organic Nature then does not exclude logos at all, at least in the sense of inherent stan- dard, essence, or form: natural beings are characterized by being stretched  between mere being and their logos as what it is for them to be. If it is true that  logos is inherent and that it is the expression of what it is for natural beings  to be, then the meaning of logos would not be restricted to reason, speech,  or ratio as strictly “subjective.” Would this natural logos be derivative of the  logos in reason, language, and logic? Would the show of natural beings be a  ventriloquism, an imposition of our structures of thinking and of living onto  nature? In short, how is this first, natural meaning of logos related to the oth- ers which seem to be “subjective”? But, as we suggested, Aristotle’s “logic,” and even the most formal part of  it, his syllogistic, may be seen to be inspired by and derived from the forms  according to logos in nature. After exploring the valid syllogisms in his logic,  Aristotle makes the general observation that all valid inferences require one  affirmative premise and one universal premise (APr. I, 24, 41b7–8). And a  universal premise requires a universal term (On Int. 7). These requirements  may be considered as following from the theôria of the positive regularities in  nature: not instantaneous miracles one after the other, but the ongoing spec- tacle of the revolution of stars, the periodical changes of seasons and weather,  the cycles of migration, wind, rain, and snow, the growth and reproduction of  plants and animals, and the show of the oak that spouts from the buried bed  and thus returns to its origin. And yet there is another sense of logos that does not apply to the whole  range of nature as “standard.” Some natural beings put up a show in a dif- ferent way and they are stretched in a different way than natural beings as  a whole. For instance, fire is certainly a natural being, it is inherently moti- vated upward or in centrifugal motion and has its “place” in the first from  last sphere of the universe.40 And yet, although it has its own logos as holding  onto the hot and the dry without letting one yield to or overtake the other,  fire is exemplary of beings that are deprived of logos in another, second sense  that we must illuminate in this section: </page> <page sequence="14"> 76 chapter 3 But to some the nature of fire seems simply to be the cause of  nutrition and growth, for it alone of all bodies and elements appears  to be nourished and grow; hence one may suppose that this is that  which works in plants and animals; yet it is somehow a concomi- tant cause, but the cause is not simply [fire] . . . for the growth of  fire is limitless [apeiron] as long as there is something to be burned,  whereas of all things composed by nature there is a limit [peras] and  logos of magnitude and growth. (DA II, 4, 416a10– 18)41 Fire served us previously as a good example for showing how the Aristote- lian concept of locomotion and place differs from early modern notions. But  something else is going on here. As logos is said in many ways, fire has logos in  one sense, as inherent standard, but not in another. True, it is “stretched” away  from the center of the universe, its topos, unlike the early modern concept of  matter, and it is “stretched” between the hot and the dry. But it simply keeps  on “stretching out” however big or small it is. Although, unlike stuff, fire is  not indifferent to its place in the universe, it is indifferent to its magnitude. The Soul as Form Nature in general or fire in particular then do not necessarily illustrate logos  in the sense of a limit of magnitude and growth. What is it that has a “logos  of magnitude and growth”? Right after the passage quoted above, Aristotle’s  answer is the ensouled, living being: “But these [limit and logos] belong to the  soul, and not to fire; [they belong] to logos more than to matter” (DA II, 4,  416a19).42 What then does Aristotle mean by soul such that it exhibits a new  sense of logos? Aristotle elaborates his own definition of the soul in several  steps in the first chapter of DA II. Let us offer a running commentary to his  first sketch: One class of those that are, we call being; but of [being], one as  matter (which in its own right is not a ‘this’ [tode ti]), another as  shape [morphê] and form [eidos] (directly as a result of which some- thing is called a ‘this’), and third that [which comes to be] out of  them. (DA II, 1, 412a6– 9)43 This is not new to us who have seen that, insofar as each is tode ti, that is, an  individual being that lends itself to direct perception, even natural beings are  “compound”; in the context of natural beings, this “composition” (ek toutôn),  as we also have seen, should be understood not as a “com- position” or “syn-  thesis” in the etymological sense of putting matter and form side by side,  </page> <page sequence="15"> natural motion 77 because such juxtaposition would be precisely missing the close interconnec- tion between the two. Aristotle continues: Now matter is potentiality and form is actuality, and this [i.e., form  or actuality] in two ways: as knowledge [epistêmê] or as contemplat- ing [theôrein]. (DA II, 1, 412a9– 11) This sentence introduces a distinction within actuality itself: form or actual- ity is either like knowledge is or like contemplating. Conceptually Aristotle  here makes room for an actuality that is unlike the full-fl edged actuality of  contemplation. So far, Aristotle’s elaboration of the concept of the soul goes  like this: if the soul is, and if one way of being is ousia, and if ousia refers to  either matter or form or the composite, and if form is said in two ways, as  knowledge or as contemplating, then the soul may be either matter or form  (as knowledge or as contemplating), or the composite. But which one? Bodies seem to be beings preeminently, and among them natural  ones. For these are the sources of the others. But some natural beings  have life, some do not. We are calling life self- nourishing as well as  growth and wasting away. So that every natural body having a share  in life would be a being, but being as composite. Since [a living natu- ral body] is such and such a body, the soul would not be body. For  the body is not among the things said of an underlying thing, but  rather as an underlying thing and a matter. (DA II, 1, 412a11– 20)44 If beings are mostly bodies and natural bodies, and if some natural bodies  share in life, and if sharing life refers to both self-n ourishing and growth  and wasting away, then self-n ourishing and growing bodies cannot simply be  bodies, but composite bodies.45 So if the living character is of the body, then  body would correspond to the matter of the composite, and soul to its form.  “Therefore it is necessary that the soul be being as form of a natural body  having life potentially” (DA II, 1, 412a20– 22). At first glance, this convoluted reasoning seems less to give us informa- tion about the soul than to impose a meaning on the word: the soul is the life  principle, and this life principle is of a body and not the other way around.  Bodies having life potentially look a certain way, perform a certain work, put  up a certain show. And the soul or living is that show: “self- nourishing as  well as growth and wasting away.” To say the least, this “most comprehen- sive” (DA II, 1, 412a6) definition of the soul is so worldly and bodily that  it immediately disappoints any reader assuming the soul to be something  </page> <page sequence="16"> 78 chapter 3 aloof, disincarnated, and otherworldly. Eating here seems to be a sufficient  condition for having a soul and a sufficient enactment of it.46 If we are at first  disappointed by this, it is perhaps because we overestimate the value of the  soul and/or we underestimate the significance of nutrition. Importantly, even as an unwarranted assumption, the claim that the soul  is said of a body and not the other way around implies the impossibility of  transmigration of the soul. If souls could transmigrate, then there would be  absolutely no sense in observing the bodies of living beings in order to under- stand their life, since their soul would have no inherent relation to their body,  and we could not do biology and any inquiry on the soul unless as some form  of “psychics.” This “definition” of the soul, however, does not help us distinguish the  natural beings that have a share in life from those that do not. Soul is defined  as form, but so was nature.47 Self- nutrition, the work minimally required  for having life, may well be interpreted as a change with respect to quantity  originating from the being itself. Since we saw that, for Aristotle, fire grows  as much as trees and animals do, how are the latter ensouled bodies distinct  from the soulless former? Despite the fact that elements can turn into one  another, as stated in GC II, 1, 329b1, why cannot we say that, when rain falls,  water is growing in puddles, just as we say that a watered plant does? Don’t  we feed fire as we feed our pets? How are the shows of nature as a whole and  those of living nature any different? Doesn’t each exhibit its inherent logic?  Why did Aristotle suggest that the growth of fire has no limit and logos? The Soul as Actuality Aristotle does not call the account of the soul we read above a “definition”  (horos, horismos, or logos). Despite the presence of the “therefore” (ara), it does  not finish anything. It is rather the first step of his dialectical reasoning in  this first chapter of DA II. In this first step, what we learned is that soul and  life and self- nourishing are coextensive. Aristotle continues: Therefore it is necessary that the soul be being as form of a natural  body having life potentially. But being is actuality; therefore [the  soul is] the actuality of such a body. But actuality is said in two  ways: first as knowledge, and then as contemplating. Thus it is clear  that [the actuality characterizing the soul] is as knowledge. (DA II,  1, 412a20– 24) Let us elaborate the crucial distinction between actuality “as knowledge” and  actuality “as contemplation.” To say that one knows Latin does not require  </page> <page sequence="17"> natural motion 79 that one constantly speak, write, read, study, and think about Latin. In fact,  on the contrary, a sign that one knows Latin is that one is able to stop put- ting to use one’s acquisition, to have internalized or “digested” it. But note  that in fact Latin is an odd example for soul and life, precisely because Latin  is a dead language. But characterizing Latin as a dead language is itself tell- ing. That a language is dead does not mean that no one in the world ever  actually writes, reads, speaks, understands, and studies it; what it means is  that nobody is able to stop putting their knowledge of Latin to use without  immediately starting to lose it. Learning dead languages is often compa- rable to Sisyphus’s endless struggle against the natural motion of the rock  that each time rolls down the hill: however much one puts it to use, it does  not quite stick. People quite often have to learn dead languages over and  over again, to resuscitate them, so to speak. Generating a sentence in a dead  language is like building a castle out of dry sand, and its maintenance is  like the constant anxiety of keeping a house of cards straight. On the other  hand, learning a living language leaves one enough room, energy, and time  for playing with it, distorting it, being creative with it, or even forgetting  about it. Knowing a living language is thus similar to life: if it slumbers, if  it is inactive, this does not mean that it is dead, it rather means it is alive.  Hence, in explaining the kind of actuality that characterizes the soul, Aris- totle interestingly explains his example of knowledge and contemplation  with yet another example he takes precisely from the realm of the soul:  sleep and waking.48 Waking is to sleep what contemplating is to “dormant”  knowledge. So, in determining the soul, Aristotle is not simply using his classical dis- tinction between potentiality and actuality, he is refining it. It is not true  that the possession of a language and sleep are states of mere potentiality  and privation, because the requirements for sleep or the possession of some  knowledge are results of prior preparation, the end-p roducts of previous  work. Only knowing beings contemplate, only sleeping beings wake up, only  immature beings can ripen. Or else we are meaning something different by  these words: if fire or a rock contemplates at all, it contemplates without ever  having known; its awakenness does not emerge out of, and ever fall back into,  sleep; it is ever complete without having matured at all. Speaking metaphori- cally and thus inexactly (Top. VI, 2, 139b34), fire is a narcoleptic fixated in  contemplation, it is a grown- up who has not lived through childhood.49 This is why Aristotle suggested that the growth and magnitude of fire has  no limit or logos. Being a natural body, the locomotion of fire has a definite  inherent directionality, away from the center of the universe. But if fire has a  regularly recognizable “form” or “look” (eidos), its pointy shape is determined  </page> <page sequence="18"> 80 chapter 3 not by its growth into a telos, but by its inherent locomotion. For the shape  of fire is rather a byproduct of its natural upward impulse. Hence, once it  reaches its natural place, it no longer has the same shape.50 The ensouled  being, on the other hand, presents a growth and completion we do not find  in nonliving nature, an instantiation of logos beyond the stretch between fac- tual being and inherent standard. Not that the soul is more complete than  fire. In fact, fire is too complete to be ensouled, or too alive to be living. This completion that distinguishes the soul from nature in general is the  achievement of a state for an activity. There is an important sense in which  ensouled beings are complete and, in a sense, “incomplete.” Beyond the  fire’s stretch out toward the completion of what it is for it to be, the soul  is stretched between the completion of its past development and its future  exercise of vital functions. The show of the soul is the show both of a “look”  toward the past (its preparedness) and a “look” toward the future (perfor- mance). In a word, the soul is characterized by being ready. This is perhaps why, while nature in general was akin to logos as “form  according to logos” (Ph. II, 1, 193a31, 193b3), the soul is also “a being accord- ing to logos” (DA II, 1, 412b11). The actuality that characterizes the soul then  requires a state of growth between potentiality and actuality as such. The soul  is either a second potentiality, or, as Aristotle puts it immediately after his  example of knowledge and contemplation, “the first actuality of a physical  body having life potentially” (DA II, 1, 412a28– 29). Organicity By being the “first actuality of a natural body having life potentially,” the soul  is a detour between mere potentiality and actuality; what distinguishes the  show of the soul from that of natural beings is that ensouled bodies precisely  display this very detour. Ensouled bodies exhibit their soul by the way they  have life potentially: while the immediacy between the potentiality and actu- ality of fire is reflected in the indifferent identity of its parts, the intermediate  state of the soul is reflected in the interrelated differences of bodily parts.  The logos as soul is such that its parts are neither fused with one another nor  indifferent to one another, but exhibit at once an achievement taken one by  one, and a project of cooperation. They are not fully actual, not fully at work,  but as yet for a work. While fire does its work, the soul has work. Hence soul  needs tools whereas fire needs none. This is why, on the one hand, watching the spectacle of fire is somewhat  similar to watching a chess game: one can start watching it from the mid- dle. The show of living beings, however, is comparable to a thriller: missing  the first scene where the murder is committed or the last scene where the  </page> <page sequence="19"> natural motion 81 murderer is revealed, or misunderstanding the development that leads to the  revelation— this is not to have really seen the movie. The parts of the life of  the ensouled being are spectacularly complete and “incomplete.”51 As the soul is thus determined by a work (ergon) as much as by actu- ally being at work (energeia) pure and simple, the parts of the body of the  ensouled being are characterized by having a work (ekhein ergon), and the  Ancient Greek adjective for having a work is organikon: “The soul is the first  actuality of a physical body having life potentially—b ut such will be any body  that is organic” (DA II, 1, 412a29– 412b1).52 The wholeness of fire does not  come out of its working parts; its pointy top, its bright body, its sparkles, its  flames are not qualitatively and mutually differentiated for a work, they are  equally and indifferently determined by the upward motion of fire as such.  It is no coincidence that the word “pyramid” comes from the Ancient Greek  pyr, “fire,” for a pyramid is precisely a shape determined by its gradually weak- ening upward orientation. The natural determination of fire does not offer a  stage of relative indetermination such that it may then determine itself. Let us emphasize this remarkable and surprising claim: for Aristotle, the  soul of animals does not show itself beyond the body. The soul does not show  itself simply in every part of the animal body taken in isolation. It rather  shows itself in the body as a whole: “The parts of the plants are organs too,  though altogether simple ones; for instance, the leaf is the covering for the  peel, and the peel for the fruit, while the roots are similar to the mouth, for  both take in food” (DA II, I, 412b1– 4). To find the soul of living beings, Aris- totle looks at their parts. The stretch that characterizes the soul in its “look”  toward the past (preparedness) and the future (performance) is seen in the  way the parts of a living body are at once developed and purposeful. Thus, to  see the soul is, once again, to “understand how that which is disrupted has  the same logos as itself: a back- stretching harmony as in the bow and the  lyre.” That Aristotle considers the parts of an organic body as developed wholes  can be seen from the fact that he takes the parts to be exemplary of the  things that exist by nature as much as whole animals (Ph. II, 1, 192b9). That  he deems the parts of animals as prepared together in order to put up a show  or to exhibit a logos may be why precisely his work Parts of Animals contains  so many fundamental insights into his understanding of nature and life. For  instance, the following: One should not recoil childishly from the examination of the  humbler animals. For in every realm of natural beings there is  something wonderful. And as Heraclitus, when strangers who  </page> <page sequence="20"> 82 chapter 3 wanted to meet him saw him warming himself at the furnace and  stopped, is said to have demanded them not to be afraid to come in  as even there the divine was present, so should one go on to study  each animal without distaste as in every being there is something  natural and beautiful. (PA I, 5, 645a14– 22) Then, as distinct from merely natural beings, living beings will exhibit a  meaning of logos other than “inherent standard.” They will do so by the way  in which their parts have work, that is, are organized. Nutrition What is this work of the soul? If the soul is indeed “preparation,” what is it  “preparation” for? What is that in view of which organs are arranged? What  is logos here logos of— since it is not “logos of being” pure and simple? Just as  the magnitude and growth of fire lack limit and logos, the “logic” of the soul  will first show itself in an inherently motivated motion and rest with respect  to quantity—t hat is, in growth. “The soul has a logos that increases itself.”53 Since the organic being is determined not by a percentage of raw ele- ments, but by its irreducibility to any lumping together of elements, its  self- nourishing and growth are not reducible to the reception and accumula- tion of one or several elements: Empedocles has not spoken in a beautiful way in adding to this  that growth happens to plants when they take root downward  because earth moves that way by nature, and when [they spread]  upward because fire moves that way . . . what is it that holds the fire  and earth together as they move in opposite directions? For, if there  is nothing to prevent this, they will be torn apart; and if there is  [something to prevent this], it is the soul and it is the cause of  growth and feeding. (DA II, 4, 415b28–4 16a9; emphasis is ours)54 This is Aristotle’s crucial reservation for understanding logos as “ratio” in the  context of living beings. The growth of organic bodies cannot be reduced to  an accumulation of elements according to any percentage, since a percentage,  although an account of the respective amounts of the ingredients, cannot  account for the very fact of their togetherness, that is, for the very stretch that  characterizes a vigorous body: “for [plants] do not grow up and not down,  but equally in both directions, and in every direction” (DA II, 1, 413a28–  29).55 Within a living body, this inclusiveness of contrary directions (up and  down) comes from the inclusiveness of different elements (fire and earth).  </page> <page sequence="21"> natural motion 83 Plants fall not as plants but precisely as earthy; plants sprout not as fire, but  as plants. Nutrition then is a processing and informing as much as an under- going or receiving. If eating involves the disintegration of a being’s form into  its elements, it also requires the subsequent reintegration of the elements in  the self- nourishing being’s form. It is not sufficient to say that nutrition is a  reception of a being’s matter without its form. Nutrition is digestion as much  as reception. It is less a process of indifferent accumulation than the reforma- tive process of bringing and holding together the formerly contrary elements  within the new form.56 It may be necessary to illustrate Aristotle’s conception of nutrition by  stating what would not count as nutrition, since us humans, having other  powers of the soul, necessarily modify nutrition according to those other  powers (hunting, tasting, gastronomy, fasting, feasting, diets  .  .  .) and are  thus susceptible of concealing it. What then would not count as nutrition?  For instance, in English “emptiness” and “fullness” are precisely inadequate  concepts for expressing nutrition, because the absence of matter in the body  is by itself insufficient for explaining hunger and thirst, just as its mere intro- duction is for nutrition. The growth of no plant ever requires water as such,  precisely because a plant is not water as such. Watering a plant rather takes  a certain form precisely because a plant is a certain form. Similarly, taking a  medicine involves a specific mode of delivery of chemicals, an exact amount,  a certain diet, a certain timing, a rhythm of sleep, and ultimately a certain  form of life. Adding water to water, flesh to flesh, blood to blood, hair to hair,  is precisely failure to nourish. Similarly, merely mixing water to earth, blood  to flesh, or olive oil to hair is the same failure to nourish as long as solely  the quantities in the mixture are considered. Nutrition is neither a transition  from emptiness to fullness, nor a delivery of matter, but a specific answer to a  specific question. Put in terms of Aristotelian ethics, proper diet is not solely  a matter of deduction from pre- given rules, but always a matter of employing  prudence or practical wisdom (phronêsis). Digestion is not becoming full, but  preparing matter, integrating it: “cooking” or “concocting” (pepsis).57 A new logic, a new logos, and a new kind of “stretch” thus emerges with  nutrition: whereas natural beings are inherently motivated to hold on to  what they are and what it is for them to be (logos as “standard”), here a living  being does so by holding on to contrary elements according to what it is to  be for itself, without simply letting one element take over or remain isolated  and idle (logos as “ratio”). It is precisely because living beings hold together  the elements according to their own form that contrary elements coexist  within living bodies instead of one knocking down the other. This is the basic  insight behind the second sense of logos: proportion, ratio, percentage.58 </page> <page sequence="22"> 84 chapter 3 But this is not enough for capturing this second sense of logos. For Aristo- tle himself objects to Empedocles’s theory that the soul is a logos or harmony  in On the Soul I:59 They say that harmony is a blend [krasis] or composition [synthesis]  of contraries and that the body is composed of contraries. How- ever, harmony is some logos of those that have been mixed [tôn  mikhthentôn] or a composition [synthesis], and the soul cannot be of  these. (DA I, 4, 407b30– 34)60 When Aristotle articulates this criticism, his object is clear: for him the soul  cannot be a harmony understood as blend or composition— a “logos of those  that have been mixed,” or a “logos of those that are mixed” (DA I, 4, 408a9).  And in the following paragraph he insists that the soul cannot be the “logos  of the mixture” (logos tês mixeôs) (DA I, 4, 408a14– 28). If the soul were a har- mony or logos of mixture, in short, a percentage, then there would be many  souls each time there is a new percentage of elements in the body, for “the  mixture of elements for flesh and for bone do not have the same logos” (DA  I, 4, 408a15– 16)61 Just as a percentage cannot account for what holds its  ingredients together, offering various percentages avoids the same question  of what holds these percentages together. If soul has to do with logos, this will  not be merely a matter of number or percentage because, however precise  and many, the percentage of ingredients will not account for their unity, for  the “stretch” between them, for what makes them parts of one show.62 The logos of growth then is not the percentage of ingredients: “The logoi  of mixtures are in the relation [prosthesei] of numbers, and not in numbers,  for instance three in relation to two and not three times two” (Metaph. XIV,  6, 1092b32– 33).63 This explains how Aristotle can explicitly agree with  Empedocles elsewhere: “Even Empedocles says that the bone is by virtue of  logos— which is ‘what it is to be’ and the being of the thing” (Metaph. I, 10,  993a17–1 9). If life and nutrition stretch out to exhibit a logos, this show is  understandable neither by means of its elements nor by their percentages. So,  if logos here means “ratio” or “proportion,” we must keep in mind the fact that  it is so not as a number, but as a relation between numbers, that is, as holding  on to its different constituents and their magnitude without letting one take  over the other or lie indifferent to them.“For a tragedy and a comedy come  into being out of the same letters” (GC I, 2, 315b14–1 5).64 Reproduction In reproduction as well as in nutrition, an ensouled being strives for the  perpetuation of itself and/or of its form by integrating contraries. What  </page> <page sequence="23"> natural motion 85 reproduction teaches us is that, just as an adequate understanding of nutrition  requires that we consider the parts of animals not as starting points, but as  products,65 we can be spectators of the show of living beings only when we  take account not of one arbitrarily chosen segment of their life, but of their  life as a whole. For instance, a squirrel exhibits its “inherent standard,” its logos  of being, its own logic, that is, what it is for a squirrel to be, not in its tail or  claws taken as ends in themselves, but as incomplete completions, as organs. In  the same way, a squirrel shows off what it is to be for a squirrel along a lapse  of time and through events that stretch beyond its maturity, even before its  birth and after its death. The form of a squirrel comes to appearance neither  in the parts of its body, nor in the slices of its life span taken by themselves,  nor in the percentage of its chemical makeup. Just as its front claws relate  back to its spine, its climbing a tree refers back to its birth and nutrition, and  forward to its project of reproduction. The life form called “squirrel” is noth- ing but an ongoing and everlasting success story. Thus we must dishabituate  ourselves from viewing nature and life forms in snapshots. If they are funda- mentally spectacular, they are not photogenic, and their movement is not still  motion. Life forms are not photographical, but “biographical.” Natural beings exhibit their show and logic not in the way objects around  us seem to be constantly available to our gaze, but in the way a war or an art- work comes into existence: the date of the birth and death of a squirrel, and  even everything in between, can be recorded and documented by a camera; yet  its soul as livingness extends even beyond its life and death—n ot as immortal,  but, on the contrary, as mortal. Reproduction in nature indeed acquires its full  significance in the context of mortal beings, of their life and death, and of  their only afterlife in offspring. A livingness that extends beyond our momen- tary mental images demands thus a “theoretical” spectator equipped, not with  “theory,” but with a wonder, patience, and scientific passivity that lets the  spectacle unfold through improbable influences and fortuitous circumstances. But On the Soul, which does not expound on nutrition, seems to leave the  topic of reproduction to Generation of Animals— except in this most crucial  passage for the corpus as a whole: We must talk about food and reproduction; for the nutritive soul  belongs to the others as well, and is the first and most common  potentiality of the soul by virtue of which living belongs to them  all. The works [of the soul] are reproduction and the use of food,  for the most natural work for living beings, if it is full- grown and  not defective or does not have spontaneous generation, is to make  another like itself: an animal making an animal, a plant a plant, so  that they may partake in the eternal and divine in the way they can.  </page> <page sequence="24"> 86 chapter 3 For all things desire [oregetai] that, and do everything they do by  nature for the sake of it. (DA II, 4, 415a23– 415b2)66 Thus, reproduction as the integration of the living being’s form into the  material of another body, and nutrition as the integration of the material  of another body into one’s own form, are two facets of the same most nat- ural work: oregesthai for partaking in the eternal and the divine. Aristotle  is quite explicit that the most natural appearance of life takes the form of  oregesthai— whose first meaning is “to reach out for grasping” and “to stretch  out for.” Until now we used “stretch” as a metaphor. Here oregesthai literally  means “to stretch,” and only metaphorically “to yearn for” or “to desire.”67 In an informative passage of the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle likens the  love of the benefactor toward the beneficiary, and of the artist toward his  work, to the love of animals toward their young: Every artist loves his own work more than he would be loved by the  work if it were ensouled. Perhaps this happens especially in the case  of poets [poiêtas], for they love their own poems [poiêmata] exces- sively, being fond of them as of their children [tekna] . . . The reason  for this is that all things choose and love to be; and it is in actuality,  in living and acting, that we are; and, being actually at work, the  maker [ho poiêsas] is in a way the work; so he is fond of the work  and thereby he is fond of being. (NE IX, 7, 1167b34– 1168a8) In line with our previous quotation from On the Soul, here Aristotle adds:  “But this is natural.” We tried to show that the spectacular character of natural beings and the  spectatorship of the natural scientist are textually grounded in Aristotle’s work.  Here we see that On the Soul supports our claim that natural beings are not  simply “programmed,” in the passive voice, to exhibit their logic, but that they  stretch out themselves for this, in the middle voice. As to the natural scientist  or the theôros, the explicit textual confirmation of his own natural yearning for  watching the show of natural beings is found not in On the Soul, but in the  first sentence of the Metaphysics: “All human beings by nature stretch them- selves out toward knowing” (Metaph. I, 1, 980a21; Joe Sachs’s translation). 3. Recapitulation and Reorientation So far as this chapter of the book is concerned, we have seen how Aristo- tle’s understanding of nature demands a conception of motion that may be  </page> <page sequence="25"> natural motion 87 intellectually remote from us because of the early modern rejection of the  Aristotelian physics, but also that it is quite familiar to us on an experiential  level. His concepts of motion and, consequently, of nature are fundamentally  “spectacular,” oriented toward the appearance of a form or look (eidos) and  the articulation of a logos. As a counterpart to this “spectacular” character of  nature, the natural scientist for Aristotle is a spectator, an explorer, a traveler,  a theôros with a question, with an openness for the improbable show of natu- ral beings. This pervasiveness of watching, of exhibition, and of expression of  logos may suggest that it is because natural beings stretch out toward showing  themselves that in Heraclitus’s famous fragment 123, “nature loves to hide  itself,” while Aristotle insists that “it is ridiculous to try to prove that nature  exists” (Ph. II, 1, 193a2– 3). As to our overall project, in section 1 of this chapter, we have seen that the  inherence of the logos as “standard” may be warranted by the inherently moti- vated motions in nature. In section 2, we have seen that two among these  motions, namely nutrition and reproduction, are made according to logos as  “ratio.” These two senses of logos, “standard” and “ratio,” are not unrelated.  They both refer to a relation that holds on to its terms without letting one  take over or lay indifferent to the other. As “standard,” logos is the relation  between potentiality and actuality in natural motion; as “ratio,” logos func- tions as holding onto previously exclusive elements within the body in the  case of nutrition, and within another body in the case of reproduction. Living beings are then minimally determined by two natural motions exhibit- ing that their “logos of being” is inherent to them: reproduction and nutrition.  Of Aristotle’s four kinds of motion, the latter are, respectively, change with  respect to being and change with respect to quantity.68 What about the other  two kinds of motion: change with respect to quality and place? Although we  claimed that plants, as ensouled bodies, integrate contrary elements, Aris- totle seems to differ when he says that plants are of earth (gês) and have no  mean condition (mesotêta).69 In fact, the plants’ accomplishment of integrat- ing and reforming matter is also their limitation: plants have “no source of  such a kind as to receive the forms of sensibles— they absorb them together  with their matter” (DA II, 12, 424b2–3 ). So, in our next chapter, we must  turn our attention to living beings that are capable of also changing with- out integrating matter, of changing with respect to quality and also to place:  sensation and locomotion. These beings change and move in new ways, and  meanwhile exhibit a show and a logos that are even more explicit than that of  elements and plants. These beings are animals. </page> <page sequence="26">  </page> </plain_text>
