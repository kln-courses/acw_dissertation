Chrysler Energy Absorbing, Anti-Theft Steering Column. D. Adams III and R. S. Cassie, Chrysler Corp. Chrysler Corporation has introduced two new features on their 1970 steering columns: an energy absorbing steering wheel which appears on the Barracuda and Challenger models; and an antitheft steering column which is standard on all car lines. This paper describes the two engineering programs. 700002. Second Generation Energy Absorbing Column with Locking Features. Donald P. Marquis, General Motors Corp. The 1969 General Motors steering column involves a new system for absorbing energy from the body of the driver in the event of a frontal collision. This steering column also contains a locking system which permits the locking of steering shaft and gear shift as well as the ignition switch. A comparison of the 1969 ball type energy absorber with the 1967 mesh type absorber shows gains in rigidity, consistency of load, and ease of changing design load. The discussion of the locking system development for various types of steering columns includes a description of the inhibiting system. 700003. The Engineering Case Study-An Interdiscipli- nary Comparison. F. J. Brewerton, University of North Dakota. The case study approach, as an educational tool, has achieved widespread use in a variety of disciplines. The case method affords several advantages over conventional and traditional lecture methods of education, but the degree of effectiveness of the case study approach varies considerably between different disciplines. Therefore, an interdisciplinary comparison of case study techniques may be of some value in improving the case study methods used in engineering studies. The most notable applications of case methods include the areas of business and management decision making, medicine, the social sciences, and engineering. The Harvard School of Business has established the pattern for business case studies. Much of today's accepted medical practice is based on "case studies." Many significant sociological and psychological findings are based on case studies, while engineering case studies can be applied to achieve a wide variety of objectives including creativity in design, technical feasibility, etc. The analysis of the case study historically applied in each discipline reveals certain characteristics which seem to be unique to each area of case study application. Interdiscipl inary comparison also reveals basic differences in case study techniques. Some of these differences lie in the nature of the discipline itself, while some are based upon extraneous causes which are completely unrelated to the area of study. 700004. The Case for Engineering Involvement in Prob- lems of Social Significance-An Integrated Un- dergraduate Project. L. L. Ambs, J. G. McGowan and G. A. Russell, University of Massachusetts. The objectives of this paper are to describe an under- graduate project recently carried out at the University of Massachusetts on a vapor cycle automotive power system, to discuss some of the educational aspects of the project, and to briefly describe some of the results obtained. The problem posed to the seven undergraduate students involved in the project concerned certain aspects of the preliminary design and development of a small vapor powered powerplant for an automotive application. The technical design criteria given at the initial stages of the project was quite general: be competitive in size, weight, and power with conventional automotive IC engines. A socially significant constraint was also given: the powerplant should have low pollutant emission characteristics. The students' interpretado nand appli- cation of this constraint to the engineering design studies clearly influenced the technical decisions they made. The data include a brief description of the technical results obtained from each problem area and the aca- demic evaluation of various students in relation to their professed interests and overall academic standing. 700005. The Use of Case Methods at General Motors Institute. William H. Lichty and John J. Mariotti, General Motors Institute. This paper outlines the use of the case method of study at General Motors Institute. The case method is a means of providing a vicarious experience for the student in the real world of engineering. GM I uses cases illustrating the total design process in its basic design course, as well as in the advance courses involving multidiscipline problems (heat transfer, fluid dynamics, etc.). The use of the case method offers the student the opportunity to learn by himself while preparing the analysis, findings, conclusions, and recommendations of a given case and to learn from other students during classroom discussion. The student utlizes theory learned in other courses or digs it out of textbooks himself. The student learns to perceive the factors in the situation, to ask relevant questions, to arrive At a decision and to communicate his position on the problems. In this manner, the classroom becomes a simulation of the working world and prepares the student for the working situation. Bibliography of case studies is included. 700006. Engineering Design at CMU. S. William Gouse, Jr. and J. C. Purcupile, Carnegie Institute of Technology. A course designed to involve senior mechanical engi- neering students in engineering problems subject to the kinds of constraints they will operate under when they leave the academic environment was developed at Carnegie Institute of Technology. The goals of the 77</page><page sequence="3">700007-700013 78 program, the kinds of projects undertaken and the results of each are discussed. 700007. Corrosion Evaluation of Phosphate Coated Fas- teners by Ferrotest. Jun L. Kojima, General Motors Corp. Fastener manufacturers and users have been searching for a quick method of evaluating the corrosion resistance of zinc phosphate coated fasteners. Ferrotest, a method for rapid evaluation of zinc phosphate coatings on panels for paint purposes, was investigated for this report. Ferrotest time for evaluating zinc phosphated fas- teners was one min. The present method of testing for corrosion resistance is 72 hr in a neutral salt spray atmosphere. Fasteners with different weight coatings and fasteners processed under varying conditions were tested, both with one minute Ferrotest and with a 24-hr salt spray test. Correlation of the two methods was good, also correlation of coatings between the supplier and user using Ferrotest was good. Ferrotest results indicate a satisfactory method for rapid evalution of phosphate coated fasteners. 700008. A Systems Approach to Attaining Multiple Thread Fastners in Thin Sheet Metal Sections. W. S. Edwards, FabriSteel Products, Inc. The methods of applying fasteners has taken on new significance with the increased need to automate the manufacturing assembly function. A systems approach is described which allows installation of multiple threaded nuts in sheet metal simultaneous with other stamping operations. Justification for new approaches to fastening pro- cedures is documented. Both system philosophy and hardware approach are treated in detail, including identifying the problem, designing for solution, supplier and user agreement and execution of the plan. 700009. Pneumatic Tools for Tightening Threaded Fas- teners. D. K. Skoog, Ingersoll-Rand Co. This paper outlines the critical factors that must be considered in obtaining good torque control of threaded fasteners when using power tools: torque and tension and control of friction, torque rate, relaxation, mulitple fasteners, and measurement errors. The construction of the various pneumatic power tools available to industry today are described, along with their applications. In- cluded are impact wrenches, torque control impact wrenches, screwdrivers, angle wrenches, and assembly machines. 700010. Assembly Plant Torque Control Using a Trans- ducer and Computer. H. W. Ellison, General Motors Engineering Staff. An assembly line torque control system has been de- veloped which makes use of the inherent repeatability of air powered wrenches. This system utilizes a small, portable torque transducer to initially set the power tool and to periodically inspect its performance. On appli- cations to be controlled, a clutch controlled or air-stall air shut-off power tool is connected to a process control computer which signals the production line worker when his job is completed and produces a permanent record of the assembly. In-plant tests of power tool shut-off characteristics and theoretical background of this system are discussed. 1970 SAE Transactions 700011. Doctrinal Basis for High Mobility Vehicles in Forward Area Army Units. Ellwood C. Hurford, U.S. Army. The doctrinal basis for high mobility vehicles in forward area units is found in a series of Army studies accom- plished in the period 1959-1969. This presentation will feature the highlights of these studies and include a description of the high mobility vehicles which will be entering Army inventories in the 1970's. A description of the mobility requirements of Army units involved in combat, combat support, and combat service support will be included. Reference will be made to the Materiel Options of Land Combat System for Operations in the 1990's, produced by the USACDC Institute of Land Combat with emphasis on objectives in the functional areas of mobility and service support. A discussion of certain terrain features, which have a particular effect on mobility, will be considered from the standpoints of the probability of the occurrence of these features on a worldwide basis. The payload categories of vehicles will be shown in relation to analyses of the frequencies of transport tasks. 700012. Commercial Off-Road Vehicles. Z. J. Janoši, R. A. Liston, L. A. Martin and D. A. Sloss, U. S. Army Tank- Automotive Command. This paper deals with commercial off-road vehicles: farm tractors, construction, logging, over-snow and recreational vehicles. Their history, their requirements, and their future trends are discussed. Farm tractors and construction and logging vehicles evolved to satisfy a need for more power than animals were able to furnish. These vehicles went through many false starts while attempting to break away from processes based on the anatomy and power of animals. Future trends point toward more automation, bigger machines, and driver comfort. Over-snow vehicles have specific technical require- ments. It seems, however, that only recreational over-snow vehicles will proliferate because of economic opportu- nities. The brief history of recreational vehicles indicates that bigger, faster, more sophisticated and consumer oriented machines can be expected in the coming years. 700013. Problems of Track Vehicle Operations in the Republic of Vietnam. D. R. Tague, U.S. Army Armor School.</page><page sequence="4">700014-700022 This presentation will address recent experiences in Vietnam with current track-laying vehicles from the viewpoint of a recently returned unit commander. Oper- ational and maintenance problems of interest from a design standpoint will be discussed. 700014. Procurement and Development of the M715 1-1/4 Ton Truck Series. R. M. Johnson, Kaiser Jeep Corp. The M715 truck is an industry designed, military ap- proved vehicle embodying optimum reliability, mobility, and maintainability, with reduced initial cost, lower operating and upkeep expense per ton mile, and a 66% increase in the rated payload capacity over the previous M37, 3/4 ton vehicle which it succeeds. This paper describes the contract concept, research and vehicle development, the rigorous testing procedures, problems and corrections, all of which have produced expectations beyond achievement. 700015. The M561 Cargo Truck - The Gama Goat. Harold W. Austrow, Consolidated Diesel Elec- tric Co.; and Leonard Kelt, U.S. Army Tank Automotive Command. The military's need for a highly mobile cargo truck capable of traveling over rough terrain and across rivers and streams led to the development of the M561 Gama Goat. The operating economy, mobility, and reduced maintenance of the M561 shows a marked improvement over other lighweight tactical vehicles. Moreover, the M561 can be used as a command and communications vehicle, troop and cargo carrier, ambulance, and prime mover of towed trucks. The versatility of the M561 will make it a valuable addition to the military's transportation fleet. 700017. Crome-Plated Plastic Grilles. Otto A. Kern and Charles L. Porter, Oldsmobile Div., General Motors Corp. Chrome-plated plastic grilles for exterior use were intro- duced into the automotive industry by Oldsmobile on the 1969 Toronado. This paper presents the development program ensued to gain confidence to release plated plastic to production. It also covers the development programs for the expanded 1970 usages. 700018. Development of Plastic Lamp Housings. F. W. Johnson, General Motors Corp. New housing materials have been developed for exterior automotive lamps, to replace the traditionally used die cast zinc and stamped steel or aluminum. Polyester premix was introduced into production by General Motors for rear lamp housings in the 1967 model year, and fiber glass reinforced polypropylene in the 1969 model year. The developmental programs which led to the approval of these new housing materials are briefly outlined. The functional requirements of this application and the comparative performances in functional tests of the metal and plastic materials are reviewed. The material physical property requirements for this application and the comparative properties of steel, aluminum, die cast zinc, polyester premix, fiber glass reinforced poly- propylene, and talc-filled polypropylene are also dis- cussed. 1970 SA E Transactions 700019. Injection Molded Polypropylene Door Trim Pan- els. A. D. Rosenstein and R. L. LaPado, Chrysler Corp. The development of the first fully molded, plastic, passenger car door trim panel is discussed in this paper. From the initial styling concept, an attempt is made to explain the various factors that lead to the choice of materials and final part overall design. Special consid- eration of the interaction of part shape and attachment is given. There is also a description of the mold and the molding conditions, and the quality control test proce- dures establisted to insure quality production. A predic- tion of concept acceptability is made in the Summary Section. Also, a suggestion for further developments of plastic surface coatings is made. 700020. Design Considerations for an Electric Car. Richard D. Thornton, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A description of the design of a sport-electric car that has performance comparable to today's small sport cars. The design emphasizes a system-view of a thoroughbred electric car, rather than a conversion of existing cars. The components used represent the best of today's technology, with an emphasis on performance, safety, reliability, and aesthetics, but not on low cost. 700021. Questions to Ask About Batteries Proposed for Electric Cars. Frank E. Ammermann, Chrysler Corp. The automotive engineer is introduced to the general principles underlying the technology of storage and fuel batteries. He is given questions to ask that will assist him in evaluating battery system proposals at any stage of development. 1970 SA E Transactions 700022. Liquid-Fuel/Air Fuel-Cell Power Systems. K. R. Williams, Shell International Petroleum Co.; and M. R. Andrew, W. J. Gressler and J. K. Johnson, Shell Research Ltd., England. This paper considers the practical feasibility of an overall vehicle power system and the likelihood of developing a fuel-cell electric car at an acceptable price in the next decade. High-temperature fuel cells are discounted be- cause of long start-up time and the weight of the individual units. The most feasible direct-fueled fuel battery is the methanol/air and hydrazine/air systems. The advantages of this type fuel cell are simplicity, instantaneous start-up 79</page><page sequence="5">700023-700028 80 capability, instantaneous availability of reactants, and a simple control for maintaining the proper concentration of fuel. Methanol is the preferred soluble fuel since it is relatively inexpensive, whereas hydrazine is toxic and mildly corrosive. The fuel cell wil be acceptable only when it is economically justified in the environment in which it is introduced. The sole criteria of reduced levels of atmos- pheric pollution will not be sufficient justification for development of a fuel-cell car. 1970 SAE Transactions 700023. Traction Drive System Design Considerations for a Lunar Roving Vehicle. Clyde S. Jones, Jr., Billy J. Doran and Frank J. Nola, George C. Marshall Space Flight Center. For an optimum design, the weight, energy consumption, and operational flexibility of the traction drive system for a lunar roving vehicle must be considered along with the power supply, motor, and power train. Other problems considered in this paper include: environment and motor dissipation; motor type (a-c or d-c) and commutation if d-c; motor controller (switching of large currents); delivery of torque at varying speeds; the power train; use of regenerative braking and conser- vation of energy; and power supply voltage variation. These problems are studied in the light of certain general system specifications, which fall into weight, performance, and environment categories. Tradeoff studies are con- sidered for purposes of optimization in each of these areas. Special consideration is given to the controller and system design as it pertains to regenerative braking and the conservation of energy. Some aspects of changing the modes of motor operation to satisfy extreme performance requirements of speed and torque are discussed. 1970 SA E Transactions 700024. An Exprimental battery Powered Ford Cortina Estate Car. L. R. Foote and J. F. Hough, Ford Motor Co. The design of the Ford Cortina Estate Car converted to propulsion by currently available batteries is described, and results for power train component performance test and vehicle driving characteristics are given. Concept and purpose of this test vehicle are discussed, and chassis and body modifications are described. Design of the electric power train, employing a d-c commutator motor and d-c solid state chopper controller, is developed. The car instrumentation is described and operating experience in several driving modes is reported. A discussion of battery characteristics concludes the paper. 1970 SAE Transactions 700025. Cylinder Head Gaskets for High Peak Pressures. G. S. Teucher, Goetzewerke AG, Germany.; and F. Stecher, Geotzewerke AG, Germany. This paper describes the development of cylinder head gaskets to meet the requirements of high-powered super- charged or multifuel diesel engines. The problems dis- cussed relate to such critical factors as material, move- ments at the sealing surfaces, correlation with engine design, and useful life and dependability . These factors and others are carefully applied to the final metal gasket product, the use of which is proving to be wholly satisfactory in diesel engine operation. Discussion: S. M. Lillis, Dana Corp-I Authors' closure 1970 SAE Transactions 700026. Mack's Fire Ring Gasket. J. R. Crowe, Mack Trucks, Inc. A new cylinder head gasket 'fire ring' combustion seal has been developed which met the requirements for our higher output diesel truck engines. New accelerated bench and engine tests were developed that proved very useful in the evalutaion and development of cylinder head gasket designs. 700027. A Range of Multicylinder, Aircooled Diesel Engines. Frank Brooks, Dormán Engine Div., English Electric Diesels Ltd. Problem areas in producing a range of multicylinder, aircooled diesel engines for universal application are described. If the manufacturer has dealt with water-cooled engines the design expertise between water cooling and air cooling is interrelated to a certain point and it is from this point that the technique required must be changed to satisfy the aircooled unit. A multipurpose design has more inherent problems than a design aimed for a specific application and it is necessary to consider all the side effects involved. Problems faced in the development of the cooling system, piston design, valve mechanisms, engine ratings, etc. for the range of Dorman's "DA" aircooled engines are highlighted. Ideal applications for the 6 and 8-cyl engines are in short haul work with maximum stop and start operation. Many installations have been made in earthmoving and snow-blowing equipment. Additions in the 8-cyl unit are planned. 700028. The FL 413-A New Series of Deutz Air-Cooled, V-Type Diesel Engines. Hans-Ulrich Howe, Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz AG, Germany. The design and development of a new series of V-type diesel engines featuring air cooling and direct injection is described. With this family of 6, 8, 10, and 12 cyl powerplants, which are avilable as naturally aspirated, turbocharaged, and turbocharged engines with inter- cooling, an output range of 150-500 hp is covered. A one cylinder unit is standard for all engines. Details are given of the development work of some assemblies, especially crankcase, connecting rod, and cylinder head and its bolting.</page><page sequence="6">700031-700037 Extensive field and bench testing of the engines have revealed excellent durability, good fuel economy, and low noise level. 700031. Corrosion Considerations in the Selection of materials in Automotive Terminal Systems. S. H. Butt and J. M. Popplewell, Olin Corp. The corrosion performance of alloys considered suitable for automotive terminal systems are examined. General corrosion is insignificant when copper alloys are used. The designer can avoid stress corrosion by choosing from a complete range of mechanical and electrical property combinations in less sensitive and even immune copper alloys. Crevice corrosion can be minimized chiefly by designing to eliminate crevices and also by choice of less susceptible alloys. Finally, dezincification can be over- come by using less susceptible modified brasses or inhibited brasses; lower zinc alloys or alloys not con- taining zinc may also be used. 1970 SAE Transactions 700032. Simulation, Duplication, and Synthesis of Fatigue Load Histories. H. R. Jaeckel, Ford Motor Co. Load spectrum testing is an advance toward the ultimate purpose of fatigue testing, that is, prediction of life in advance of service. The relative merits of the three basic approaches to load spectrum testing, the Programmed Fatigue Test, the Service Duplication Test, and the Random Load Spectrum Test, are discussed and com- pared to the conventional Constant Amplitude Test technique. Practical examples from car and truck engineering are given for each of the three test techniques, and a general introduction to the new test concept of random load spectrum testing is included. Advantages cited are: good corria tion to service life, low scatter of results, and reduction of overall test time. Detailed knowledge of service load histories is required, as is test machinery with suitable frequency response. 1970 SA E Transactions 700033. An Investigation of Fatigue in a Supersonic Transport Operating Environment. L. A. Imig, NASA, Langley Research Center. The effects of aircraft-loading parameters on the fatigue behavior of titanium alloy have been investigated for a schedule of stresses representing the flight-by-flight variation of stress at a point in the lower wing surface of a supersonic airplane. The effects of design mean stress, minimum stress for ground-air-ground cycles, taxi stress, thermal stress, elevated temperature, and salt corrosion were investigated and are reported here. Of the loading parameters studied, the design mean stress and the minimum stress for ground-air-ground cycles had the greatest effects on fatigue life. Fatigue lives at 550 F (560 K) were about half as long as at room temperature for most conditions investigated. The effect of the difference in flight duration on fatigue life was less than a factor of 2. 1970 SAE Transactions 700034. Estimation of Component Life Using Stress Distribution Parameters. Miroslav Hanke, UVMV-Motor Car Research Institute.; and Stephen L. Bussa, Ford Motor Co. The determination of the component fatique life under cyclic loading with variable stress amplitudes is a problem of high interest for the automobile engineer. This paper is a theoretical study showing that the factors influencing the value of the expected life can be specified by the choice of a convenient mathematical formulation of the loading spectrum shape, of the S-N curve slope and of an appropriate cumulative damage law. The final equation proved to be suitable for graphical presentation. That allowed construction of a very general nomograph for rapid informative calcluations and thus allowed time for further quantitative analysis of the influence of every considered parameter separately as well as for the formulation of requirements on the accuracy of their determination. According to these results, the influence of the spectrum width (maximum stress range) appeared as the most serious one followed by the influence of the unit spectrum size, of the slope of the S-N curve and of the degree of its modification, while the influence of the spectrum shape (i.e. of the changes inside the range of the exponential type of distribution and the normal one) was by far of a lower importance. This work can serve not only for the decision about the most effective way for redesigning a weak component but also for comparing two program load tests. Discussion: S. L.

Beauvais, Ford Motor Co. 81</page><page sequence="7">700040-700049 82 On high-speed, dual-lane expressways, such as the interstate highway system, drivers encountering problems usually park their vehicles on the highway shoulder in close proximity to the outer lane. If a tire change is required, then the vehicle must be jacked up and the aerodynamic inputs from passing vehicles become a design criteria for jacking systems. The study covered by this paper was carried out to determine the magnitude and time history of these aerodynamic forces and moments. 700040. Predicting Penetration Rates of Plows with Combined Vertical and Fore-Aft Vibration and Flexible Blades. Martin Senator and Robert E. Warren, Bell Telephone Labs., Inc. Three soil models are developed which retain much of the simplicity of a previously proposed modified Coulomb soil model, yet which allow penetration rates to be predicted for vibrating plows that combine suitably phased vertical blade motion with fore-aft blade vibration. In addition a method is developed for accounting for blade flexibility in a manner which is compatible with the simplicity of these soil models. The main new soil model is based on the assumption of a constant amount of energy being necessary to penetrate a unit volume of soil. 700041. A Study of Concepts in Child Seating and Restraint Systems. D. H. Robbins, A. W. Henke and V. L. Roberts, University of Michigan. A large number of child seating and restraint systems are currently available on the market. This paper presents experimental data from impact sled tests in order to discuss the relative merits of several design concepts. Both seats and harnesses were considered in the study. They were attached to the vehicle by a variety of techniques including: 1. hookover seat; 2. hookunder seat; 3. adult lap belt; 4. auxiliary strap around adult seat back; and, 5. combinations of the above. Tests were conducted with seats facing forward, sideways, 45 deg oblique, and rearward. Test subjects were commercially manufactured three year anthropometric test devices and test dolls fabricated at The University of Michigan representing a three-month old infant. Head and chest accelerometers were mounted in the dummies. High speed photographic coverage from the front and from the side was used to record the kinematics of the event. Conclusions were drawn concerning attachment of the various seats to the vehicular seat structure, dynamic interaction between the vehicle seat and the child seat or harness, structural integrity of various devices, and protection offered by the various design concepts in front, side, and rear-end collisions. Credit should be given to the National Highway Safety Bureau, U. S. Department of Transportation for funding this study under Contract FH- 11-6962. 1970 SA E Transactions 700042. Design and Development of the General Miotors Infant Safety Carrier. N. Feles, Fisher Body Div., General Motors Corp. This paper is a discussion of the design and development of the General Motors Infant Safety Carrier. Specific data and information based on this age group, from birth to approximately 10 months of age, will be examined and explored as they are directly related to the construction and application of this specialized infant safety restraint system. Also, the inherent problems involved in the initial development and designing phases required to produce a safety device specifically adapted for this age group of infants will be presented. It will consider the unique circumstances encountered to reach the ultimate goal of protecting and securing infants within the automobile when involved in sudden stops or possible collisions. Further, it will explore some of the numerous approaches, procedures, and techniques pursued in areas related to design, testing, restraint properties, and built-in versatility factors of the Infant Safety Carrier. 1970 SA E Transactions 700043. Instrument Panel Design - The "Control Center" of the Car. Harvey Nissley and John Elliott, Ford Motor Co. The design of an automotive instrument panel has become an increasingly complex job as product evolution in terms of customer safety, mechanical improvements, optional features and customer wants have altered the content of the automotive vehicle, and added substantially to the design requirements that must be observed in this area of the vehicle. To provide a perspective of the total job required to accommodate the changing and diverse standards and engineering requirements, this report will tell the story of the Ford Motor Company instrument panel design process. The report will cover all of the major considerations that affect the finished appearance of the design as well as the considerations required for customer convenience, and instrument panel serviceability. 700045.

High- Alumina Ceramics As Design Materials. Robert M. Smith, Coors Porcelain Co. High-alumina ceramics are among the most versatile and extensively used nonmetallic engineering materials. Be- cause they have many good physical properties, are relatively low in cost and readily available, their appli- cations are widespread and becoming more diverse each year. This paper describes some of the ways high-alumina ceramics are used today. 700052. An Advanced Radiotracer Technique for As- sessing and Plotting Oil Consumption in Diesel and Gasoline Engines. Frank Warrick and Roger Dykehouse, Sealed Power Corp. A radiotracer method for measuring engine oil con- sumption, using tritium as the tracer element, has been adapted for use in both gasoline and diesel engines. The method is rapid, accurate, versatile, and almost totally free from radiological hazard. A digital computer with plotter has been programmed to produce a unique oil con- sumption "map" over the effective engine operating range. Such a map will indicate at a glance the areas of operation requiring improvement from an oil consumption stand- point. Some interesting observations have also been made of transient oil consumption phenomena. Discussion: R. C. Pulst and W. P. Evans, Caterpillar Tractor Co.; B. W. Coles, Chevron Research Co.; L. S.

Viscosity Stability of Polymer-Thickened Oils. N. V. Messina and H. H. Radtke, Rohm &amp; Haas Co. A continuous, high speed road test has been found to accurately assess the shear stability of motor oils under all types of engine operation. It has also been demonstrated that a methacrylate polymer of sufficiently low molecular weight is completely shear stable under shearing condi- tions of the high speed road test. A road shear stability survey of commercial multi-graded oils has shown that some oils fail to show the expected viscosity decrease due to oil oxidation. Preliminary road tests in diesel engines have shown the shear stability losses in polymer-thickened oils similar to those produced in the gasoline engines. Shear stability studies in automatic transmission fluids by both bench and field tests have shown that this application is substantially more severe than the engine in shearing polymeric V.l. improvers. 700054. Polymethacrylates For Tomorrow's Multigrade Oils. Ulrich Schödel, Rohm &amp; Haas GmbH. Wear tests in a number of European gasoline and diesel engines and a study of deposit formation in Caterpillar 1 H and MS Sequence V B tests show that polymethacrylate VI improvers in multigrade motor oils can lower wear levels below those predicted on the basis of oil viscosity, even under extreme operating conditions; new dispersant type polymethacrylates decrease deposit formation not only in MS Sequence V B but also in Caterpillar 1 H tests; and polymethacrylates should continue to play their important role in the formulation of multigrade motor oils. 700055. Oil-Consumption Measurements of Individual Cylinders in Automotive Engines. W. J. Mayer, D. P. Krause, C. P. Moore and C. B. Murphy, Research Labs., General Motors Corp.

The method employed bromine-82 as the indicating isotope and consisted of the extraction of radioactive hydrogen bromide from a known fraction of cylinder exhaust gas. The precision of the method is + 10%. Oil consumption was measured for the individual cylinders over a speed range 1200-2800 rpm and a load range 18-6 in. intake manifold depression. The oil consumption of the engine determined by the summation of the oil consumption of the individual cylinders agreed reasonably well with the oil consumption measured on the overall engine. Variation in oil consumption between cylinders in the particular engine used was found to be surprisingly large-in some instances a factor of three. Oil-consumption measurements were extended to each bank of the engine as well as the overall engine by the extraction of the radiometric hydrogen bromide from a known fraction of their respective exhausts. 700056. Taking the Materials Approach to a Can- Am Chassis. Lawrence F. Looby, Armco Steel Corp.; and Robert S. McKee, McKee Engineering.

The design advantages gained in the use of these very high specific strength and specific modulus materials are shown. Their use in future racing cars will be more in the area of highly stressed compo- nents, rather than complete vehicle concepts. Their use in passenger cars will also be in highly stressed components, and will depend upon the emphasis placed on pow- er/weight ratios of specialty vehicles. 700057. The Development of the Modern Truck Disc Wheel. J. N. Bradley, The Budd Co. The development of the truck disc wheel from World War II through the present period is traced. Both the tubed and tubeless developments are discussed with a look at where we are today, and what some of the wheels will be in the immediate future. The duo rim is discussed in some detail as the answer to a requirement for an orderly development from tubed to tubeless. 700059. Fuel Ignition in a Rapid Compression Machine: Sensitivity to Flame Ignition by Particles. W. W. Haskell, Shell Oil Co. Fuel ignition in a rapid compression machine is a spatially uniform process in the absence of solid particles. Recent work with the opposed-piston rapid compression machine has shown that particle ignition of a flame can override the gas phase ignition process unless elaborate precautions are taken to reduce particle contamination. Contrary to earlier interpretations, these results imply that tempera- ture gradients generated during compression are not a major factor in the formation of nonuniform ignitions. 1970 SAE Transactions 700060. Gross Chemical Kinetics from Monitored Piston Engines. G. A. Karim, Univ. of Calgary, Can- ada.; and M. O. Khan and N. P. W. Moore, Imperial College, London. The paper describes the computational and experimental approach of deriving gross chemical kinetic data of the combustion of common fuels using a motored engine. The approach is based on the accurate calculation of the rate of heat release due to autoignition reactions. Kinetic data of the combustion of rj-heptane, propane, and methane in air together with the role of the presence of a higher hydrocarbon vapor such as rj-heptane with methane and propane are presented and discussed mainly in relation to dual-fuel engine phenomena.

C. Duke, The Pennsylvania State Univ. The knock intensity of an SI engine has been defined using the combustion chamber rate of pressure change. The instrumention used to measure knock intensity is described. The knock intensity spectrum for a CFR engine operating over a range of engine conditions is presented to illustrate the use of the definition. 700062. The Relation Between Knock and Exhaust Emis- sions of a Spark Ignition Engine. L. C. Duke, S. S. Lestz and W. E. Meyer, The Pennsylvania State Univ. The effect of knock intensity on exhaust emissions was examined in a single cylinder spark ignition engine. The exhaust components surveyed were carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen (as NO), and total unburned hydrocarbons. Knock was induced solely by changing the spark timing. To quantitatively describe knock intensity, the magnitudes of the rate of pressure irregularities occuring during the combustion process were utilized. The use of the rate of pressure change to define a quantitative knock intensity scale is supported by an apparent generalization of the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio data. Graphs are presented that indicate the dependency of power output as well as exhaust emissions on knock intensity for various air fuel ratios. 700063. A Multichannel Electronic Gating and Counting System for the Study of Cyclic Dispersion, Knock and Weak Mixture Combustion in Spark Ignition Engines. H. I. S. Allwood, G. A. Harrow and L. J. Rose, Shell Research Ltd. Cyclic variations in the course of combustion occur in gasoline engines and are inextricably bound up with engine design features. The existence of these variations (cyclic dipsersion) therefore needs to be recognized in any study of the normal combustion behavior of fuels in engines. The multichannel gating and counting system described provides a rapid and convenient means of measuring the extent of dispersion in an engine without the need for access to a computer. The equipment consists of an eight-channel gating unit, a crankangle selector and a nine-channel pulse counter. 1970 SAE Transactions 700064. Cyclic Variations and Average Burning Rates in a S.I. Engine. Bruce D. Peters and Gary L. Borman, University of Wisconsin. A method of calculating mass burning rates for a single cylinder spark-ignition combustion engine based on experimentally obtained pressure-time diagrams was used to analyze the effects of fuel-air ratio, engine speed, spark timing, load, and cyclic cylinder pressure variations on mass burning rates and engine output. A study of the effects on mass burning rates by cyclic pressure changes showed the low pressure cycles were initially slow burning cycles. Although large cyclic cylinder pressure variations existed in the data the cyclic variations in imep were relatively small.</page><page sequence="10">700065-700072 700065. Intermolecular Forces Across an Interface. Robert J. Good, State University of New York at Buffalo. The different types of intermolecular forces that can act across an interface are reviewed. In the case of the dispersion force and the dipole-dipole force, quantitative calculations can be made, to predict the energy of adhesion and the interfacial free energy. The relationship between the "interaction parameter" method of Fowkes is discussed. Forces across interfaces due to hydrogen bonds, to ionic attraction, to metallic forces, and to covalent bonds are also discussed. 700066. Current Views of Mechanisms of Adhesion. J. R. Huntsberger, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. To determine the relative importance of various mecha- nisms or "theories" in establshing the performance of adhesive bonds, an examination is made of bonds between two homogeneous chemically uniform materials; bonds between complex multicomponent phases; interfacial diffusion; electrostatic forces in adhesion; and the influence of specific interfacial bonds. 700067. Boundary Layers and Their Relevance to Adhe- sive Joint Behavior. Louis H. Sharpe, Bell Telephone Labs., Inc. This paper discusses the existence, development, and control of boundary layers and their effect upon adhesive joint behavior. Intrinsic boundary layers influence the behavior of adhesive joints in which they are present. Boundary layer properties are dependent on the condi- tions used to generate them. 700068. Mechanical Properties of Polymer Composites Related to Adhesion. Lawrence E. Nielsen, Monsanto Co. Many mechanical properties of composite materials are affected by the nature of the adhesion between the phases. Adhesion plays an especially important role in deter- mining the stress-strain behavior of composites, but quantitative theories have been developed only for the elastic moduli. Dynamic mechanical properties (especially damping) are also strongly dependent upon the type of adhesion between the phases. 700069. The Present and Future Use of Solvent and Evaporative Types of Adhesives in the Automo- tive Industry. David E. Felske, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. Uses of solvent and evaporative type adhesives in the automotive industry are reviewed. The use of adhesives is traced from the earliest days when fasteners were screws, nails, and wood glue to the development of neoprene type adhesives used during late 1940's, and to evaporative adhesives made from synthetic elastomers and resins in use today. Specifications are presented covering requirements of a sprayable, fast air-drying rubber based solvent type adhesive, as well as requirements for a fast setting synthetic water dispersion adhesive system. Problems facing automotive engineers in selection of adhesives are demands for safety, elimination of toxicity, danger of flammability, and air pollution control. The future of automotive solvents and evaporative adhesives is an exciting one and new developments such as irradiation activation and ultrasonic curing will help most challenges of the future. 700070. The Present and Future Status of Hot Melt Adhesives in the Automotive Industry. Robert E. Murray and Lawrence J. Marlin, USM Corp. A basic description of hot melt adhesive technology is followed by a discussion of the effects of the four variables: heat, pressure, open time, and volume of adhesive. Some features of hot melts are freedom of pollution, labor saving, cleanliness, and 100% use of material. Current automotive uses are reviewed and future uses are envisioned. New applicators are being designed to make this tool suitable for more on-line operations. 700071. The Present and Future Uses of Reactive Type Adhesive. Ken A. Habeeb, Inmont Corp. Reactive type adhesives represent the beginning of structural bonding, an industry that has had a tremendous growth in the past 20 years. These adhesives continue to have the greatest number of advantages toward optimum bonding, including good initial wetting and environmental resistance. The extent of their use in the automotive industry has been somewhat limited, especially when compared to their tremendous growth and acceptance in the building of today's aircraft. Their use in the building of tomorrow's automobile represents an excellent oppor- tunity to the automotive designer when he must exploit every advantage offered by the best adhesives. Reactive type adhesives can be successfully used in low-volume production, military vehicles, replacement parts, and similar applications. 700072. The Use of Sealants in the Automotive Industry. Robert W. Harries and Ted Skonieczny, Chrysler Corp. The use of sealants as a manufacturing technique in the automotive industry is a dynamic, constantly changing applications area brought about by the constantly chang- ing needs of the industry itself. For example, new structural designs, new safety requirements, new manu- facturing techniques, and new materials of construction have all created new demands for new sealant appli- cations. New improved products are replacing old. New methods of application, which are faster, cleaner, and less expensive, are replacing old application techniques. In some cases, the new application may have a unique set of requirements, or it may require a multiplicity of functions. For example, not only should the product serve as a sealant, but it also should be a sound absorber, provide 85</page><page sequence="11">700073-700080 86 corrosion resistance, and be decorative in appearance and texture and be more adaptable to automated processing. Through the impetus of increased customer demands and the need for improvements in existing technologies, the automotive industry is constantly seeking improved, more efficient, less costly techniques of manufacture. These increased demands for improvements in the automotive manufacturing process have been translated into increased demands on the functional roles of sealant applications. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss the general application areas of sealants in the automotive industry and the requirements of these applications, and to describe some of the systems which are currently being used. In addition, the requirements for some new applications will also be discussed. 700073. The Development of the Pumpless Gas Engine Concept. Julius E. Witzky and Roy W. Hull, Southwest Research Institute. The major events in the development of a "pumpless" gas engine concept are related. The immediate objective of the subject program was to develop a combustion system for natural gas fueled engines which, when compared with conventional gas engines, would be operationally simpler and easier to maintain with no appreciable penalty in specific fuel consumption. The pumpless gas principle was successfully demon- strated on a single-cyclinder, 2 cycle engine. The concept was then extended, with the aid of combustion photog- raphy, to a single-cylinder, 4 cycle laboratory engine. The feasibility of the concept was further demonstrated by the conversion of a commercially available 4 cycle, 4 cyl diesel engine. 700074. Reduction of Emissions from the Curtiss-Wright Rotating Combustion Engine with an Exhaust Reactor. David E. Cole, University of Michi- gan.; and Charles Jones, Curtiss-Wright Corp. The Curtiss-Wright RC2-60 engine exhaust emmissions were measured, with and without an exhaust reactor, under steady-state conditions at the University of Mich- igan and in a vehicle operated on the simulated California cycle at an independent facility. The reactor successfully reduced the emission levels in both cases. Data are presented for the steady-state trends of engine emissions as a function of engine performance variables; trends are generally similar to those of conventional gasoline engines. The particular effectiveness of an exhaust reactor with the RC engine is attributed to port characteristics and higher exhaust gas temperatures unique to this engine together with new reactor design features. Theoretical considerations and futures investigations are discussed. 1970 SA E Transactions 700075. New Turbocharging Systems for Two-Stroke Cycle Diesel Engines. D. W. Tryhorn, Sir W. G. Armstrong Whitworth &amp; Co. (Engineers) Ltd. The paper describes the development of new methods of turbocharging 2-stroke cycle engines. Work on the normal simple system, which has a turbocharger alone, and the series turbocharging system which employs a Roots blower after the turbocharger, showed their limitations and potentialities. In developing a system incorporating the best features of each, the throughput of the engine driven blower was controlled to make the air delivery of the series turbocharging system more similar to that obtained with simple turbocharging, thus greatly im- proving the fuel consumption and torque curve of a vehicle seized engine. A second change was to use the two types of charging systems on the same engine, thereby halving the size and parasitic losses of the engine driven blower. This gave further improvement in fuel consumption and is suitable for engines large enough to use two turbochargers. 700078. Natural Gas Fueled Vehicles Exhaust Emissions and Operational Characteristics. R. W. McJones, Consulting Engineer.; and R. J. Corbeil, Pacific Lighting Service Co. Natural gas fuel in a lean mixture with 25% excess air operates satisfactorily in an otherwise normal automotive engine. All exhaust emissions known to contribute to air pollution are reduced to levels meeting or bettering currently proposed standards. Dual-fuel operation with gasoline as a standby fuel permits immediate use of natural gas prior to the establishment of a widespread fueling network. 700079. Toyo Kogyo's Research and Development of Major Rotary Engine Problems. Kenichi Yamamoto and Takashi kuroda, Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd., Japan. This report covers the structural features of the 10A engine, which is a protype, 2 rotor, rotary engine designed for automotive use. Among the studies carried out, particular attention was given to problems concerning cracking of the rotor housing, attributable to thermal fatigue. Measures taken to solve this problem are described. Other investigations were directed toward trial application of a die-cast rotor housing with thin chromium plating applied by the transplant coating process; meas- urements taken off flame propagation within the com- bustion chamber by using ion gap plugs; and reduction of HC emission by adoption of air injection with a thermal reactor.

Spark Plug Design Factors and Their Effect on Engine Performance. Robert J. Craver, Richard S. Podiak and Reginald D. Miller, Champion Spark Plug Co. Spark plug design features are established by both the engine designer and the spark plug engineer to obtain the optimum engine and spark plug performance for the specific application. The paper describes the elements which influence spark plug design, discusses factors affecting the spark plug voltage requirement, operating temperature and heat range, and presents test data showing the effect of various firing end configurations on engine performance. The engine tests were performed in a medium displacement V-8 engine at a simulated 30 mph road load operating condition. The results suggest that the ignition of lean fuel/air ratios can be extended by projection of the spark plug gap deeper into the combustion chamber and that there exists an optimum relationship between elec- trode size and gap spacing. Further tests, with ignition systems having widely varying spark discharge charac- teristics, indicate the very short spark durations to be detrimental in igniting lean fuel/air ratios. 1970 SAE Transactions 700082. Analysis and Digital Simulation of Carburetor Metering. D. L. Harrington, Research Labs., General Motors Corp.; and J. A. Bolt, The University of Michigan. This paper reports a comprehensive analysis of carburetor metering, employing the fundamentals of fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, and numerical analysis to develop a simulation program. This includes the interactions be- tween individual systems as well as the relationships of the fuel, ambient air, engine, and vehicle variables to carburetor metering. Mathematical models for the indi- vidual systems of an air-bleed, double-venturi carburetor are established, and a logical iteration procedure is developed to solve the resulting simultaneous relationships utilizing a digital computer. Basic data on air-bleed flow rates, pressure losses for two-phase flow, and fuel- property effects are presented and discussed. Applications of the simulation are illustrated, and experimental data from both on-engine carburetor tests and fuel-channel model tests are utilized to evaluate the predictions. 1970 SAE Transactions 700083. Some Factors to Consider in the Design and Application of Automotive Ignition Systems. Paul C. Kline, Delco-Remy Div., General Motors Corp. Ignition is such a vital factor in the performance, reliability and service life of the internal combustion gasoline engine that its basic design and application deserve major attention from the engine designer. This paper reviews the electrical and mechanical functions of present-day standard, or "Kettering" type ignition sys- tems, and discusses potential design and application problems, together with ways to avoid them. Distributor mounting and drive, environmental factors such as moisture and dirt, radio frequency suppression, and exhaust emission considerations are briefly discussed. Advantages and limitations of typical semiconductor systems are also presented because these comparatively new systems offer major advantages that, on many applications, more than justify their premium initial cost. 1970 SAE Transactions 700084. Laser Obstacle Detector and Warning System. J. F. Ziomek, E. A. Marsh and J. S. Forkner, Ford Motor Co.; and J. W. Halligan, Radiation Inc. A rear obstacle detector and warning unit was designed to detect the presence of an object in the rear blind spot behind a vehicle and warn the operator if the possibility of backing over the object exists. A semiconductor infrared laser and a semiconductor detector, mounted on a vehicle behind the rear axle with a unique optical lens system proved capable of detecting small objects up to 10 ft directly behind the vehicle. The unit performance verified the ability to design an obstacle detection system with a sharply defined field of view using infrared technology. Discussion: C. S.

Nemeth, The Ohio State University. The sensitivity factor, X, of stimulus response car follow- ing equations was computed based on response time, r, obtained from serial survey data. Vehicles of a platoon are investigated as they approach, proceed through, and leave behind a kinematic disturbance, and an inherent local and asymptomatic instability is discovered. Aerial survey data is used in a numerical example to demonstrate how multiple rear-end collisions can be triggered by one vehicle. A driver aid system, informing drivers about the differential velocity between lead and following vehicles, could improve stability, although the final answer appears to lie in automated or semi-automated longitudinal control systems. 1970 SAE Transactions 700086. Automatic Headway Control - An Automatic Vehicle Spacing System. Joseph W. Crow and Robert H. Parker, Ford Motor Co. Automatic headway control is an evolutionary step towards an automatic vehicle guidance and control system. This system expands the capability of the currently available production option-speed control.

The electronic and electromechanical hardware design based on the theory presented is fully described. 87</page><page sequence="13">700087-700093 88 The limitations and advantages of the system are explained, based on test results from actual trial runs on an implemented vehicle.

This paper describes a relatively simple projector lamp which is self-aiming in relation to an oncoming vehicle. Its powerful beam supplements the light given by standard lower beams. An automatic shutter cuts off that part of the beam which would otherwise dazzle the oncoming driver. The re- mainder of the beam shines past the opposing vehicle, more than doubling the seeing-distance. 700089. Radical Improvements in Tire and Wheel Quality - Their Effects Upon Radial Force Variation of the Assembly. Lloyd A. Nedley and Deane M. Gearig, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp. Original equipment tires and wheels on today's auto- mobiles use new finishing operations that greatly reduce the radial force variation of the tire-wheel assembly resulting in improved ride quality. This paper presents radial force variation levels for past, present, and future combinations of tires and wheels. 1970 SA E Transactions 700090. Speed and Load Control Programming of En- durance Tire Test Machines. R. L. Bock, Akron Standard.; J. Lichtman, Ogden Technical Labs.; and W. D. Watkins, Adamson United Co. Uses of solvent and evaporative type adhesives in the automotive industry are reviewed. The use of adhesives is traced from the earliest days when fasteners were screws, nails, and wood glue to the development of neoprene type adhesives used during late 1940's, and to the evaporative adhesives made from synthetic elastomers and resins in use today. Specifications are presented covering requirements of a sprayable, fast air-drying rubber based solvent type adhesive, as well as requirements for a fast-setting synthetic water dispersion adhesive system. Problems facing automotive engineers in selection of adhesives are demands for safety, elimination of toxicity, danger of flammability, and air pollution control. The future of automotive solvents and evaporative adhesives is an exciting one and new developments such as irradiation activation and ultrasonic curing will help meet challenges of the future. 700092. Measurement of Tire Shear Forces. Howard Dugoff and B. J. Brown, Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan. Based on a review of existing theoretical and empirical knowledge of the mechanics of pneumatic tires and tire/vehicle systems, a requirement is defined for ex- perimental data relating the shear forces developed at the tire-road interface to the kinematic variables of influence. Test equipment to satisfy this requirement consists of two complementary pieces of apparatus: a laboratory facility which is a modified version of the B.F. Goodrich flat-bed tester, and a mobile device which consists of a three-component (Fx, Fy, MJ strain-gage dynamometer mounted on a heavy duty highway tractor. It provides a capability for testing at speeds up to 70 mph, normal loads up to 2000 lb, tire side-slip angles up to 18 deg, and steady state or programmed variations in longitudinal tire slip from fully locked (100% slip) to 30% overdriven (-30% slip). Representative samples of tire mechanics data obtained using the new equipment are presented and discussed. 1970 SA E Transactions 700093. Correlation of Cord Loads in Tires on Roadwheel and Highway. Samuel K. Clark and Richard N. Dodge, The University of Michigan. Strain gage instrumented transducers were used to measure the cord loads at a number of locations in several different automotive tires loaded against both flat and cylindrical road wheel surfaces. The two basic types of cord load fluctuation encountered in all automobile tires have been identified from these measurements, and the most severe location for cord load fluctuations has been closely bracketed. By these measurements, it has been possible to show that for each tire definite relations exist between the cord loads induced while running on a cylindrical drum and while running on a flat surface. The maximum cord load fluctuations in a tire are the same for the NBS roadwheel and flat surface when the tire is loaded against the roadwheel with a load of between 85 and 90% of that used on the flat surface. This result, while obtained on the basis of a very limited number of tire tests, agrees well with the figure of 88% which has been reportedly used in some industrial testing programs. There exists no combination of load and pressure for which it can be reliably stated that tire cord loads while running on the cylindrical roadwheel are the same throughout the tire as when running on a flat surface.

Lorenz, Michigan Wheel Co. In spite of the apparent simplicity of marine propellers, their selection for small craft is complicated because of the possible interactions of numerous pertinent variables. It is not the intent of this paper to discuss propellor design, but rather to present procedures for selecting the most efficient propeller commercially available. A secondary objective is to point out the importance of gear reduction and its effect on propeller efficiency. To achieve these objectives, this paper will discuss those variables which must be considered in determining propeller dimensions and the modifications of these dimensions necessary for satisfactory performance under cavitating conditions. 1970 SA E Transactions 700095. A Pressure Exchanger for Marine Propulsion. Joseph V. Foa, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The turbopropeller transfers mechanical energy from the flow of a working fluid to that of a momentum medium. The same transfer can be effected more directly by pressure exchange, that is, through the work of mutually exerted pressure forces at appropriately generated inter- faces between the two flows. The main drawback of pressure exchangers is that they are of necessity non- steady-flow machines, highly time-sensitive and not easily controlled. This difficulty is overcome in the "bladeless propeller," a pressure exchanger whose flow processes, although nonsteady in the frame of reference in which they are utilized, admit a frame of reference in which they are steady. Available theories and experimental results indicate this advice promises to combine an attractive efficiency with advantages of compactness and mechan- ical simplicity. 1970 SA E Transactions 700096. Design of High-Speed Propellers for Nonuniform Flow. Richard Hecker, Naval Ship Research and Development Center. Marine propellers must often operate in a spatially varying wake. Such nonuniform flow, usually referred to as the wake pattern, often leads to severe problems such as vibration and cavitation. Cavitation, in turn, can produce two serious results: loss of performance and blade damage due to cavitation erosion. Cavitation erosion is usually the more serious of the two problems. Propellers can be designed to operate in uniform flow by presently available procedures with reasonable assur- ance that cavitation problems can be identified during the design stage. However, cavitation erosion problems of propellers which must operate in a nonuniform flow cannot be identified except by experimental evaluation. This paper presents the design procedures and the experimental results of a high-speed propeller designed to operate in nonuniform flow with little or no cavitation erosion. 700097. Establishment of Roof Rail Sealing Parameters for Automobile Bodies. J. H. Senteney, Ford Motor Co. The reduction of sound levels in modern automobiles has called attention to wind whistles in the body side sealing systems. Methods employed to establish sealing design parameters are reviewed and the primary cause of wind noise in the body side sealing system is defined as a loss of glass-to-weatherstrip contact, produced by door glass "blowout" in vehicles traveling at highway speeds. A program of controlled dynamic testing resulted in design parameters that have produced body side sealing systems which, together with improved assembly techniques, have increased the first test-run wind noise acceptability rate for 1970 model year vehicles. 700098. Windshield Sealing Parameters. Ronald R. Par- ry, American Motors Corp. Windshield sealing materials, related parts, and the process concept are all principle factors in determining what will be used to fill the void between the windshield glass and body opening. In order to insure that maximum efficiency is attained when related parts are determined, it is essential that prime considerations, which must begin in the styling studio, are strengthened by the designer with their eventual success or failure contingent on the development of a sound process system for installing the windshield. Essentially, this report pursues these param- eters pointing out such things as styling and design considerations, Federal Regulations, materials available, processes and some future considerations. 700099. An Ultrasonic Leak Detector for Automotive Field Service. James R. Hughes, Ford Motor Co. A wind noise, dust, and water leak detector has been developed for use in the automotive dealership service environment. The detector effectively indicates the precise location of leaks and presents a quantitative indication of the magnitude of the leaks in any body compartment. The new kit embodies a unique application of advanced ultrasonic detection techniques by employing an ultra- sonic source and an ultrasonic detector. The device is inexpensive, relatively simple to operate and results in a significant reduction in the manhours required to detect wind noise, dust, and water leaks in automobiles. 700100. A New Exhaust Emissions Analyzer for Auto- motive Service Applications. James R. Hughes, Ford Motor Co.; and Ralph H. Torborg, Honey- well Inc. An exhaust emissions analyzer, developed for use in the automotive dealership service environment, presents an accurate determination of the carbon monoxide con- centraton in the exhaust of any engine at a steady state test condition. It also presents an indication of the unburned hydrocarbon concentration relative to "nor- mal" for any reciprocating spark ignition emission controlled engine at a steady state curb idle test condition. 89</page><page sequence="15">700101-700107 90 Its utility as a field service tool is thus twofold: used as a diagnostic device it enables a technician to decide if an engine has a carburetion problem and used an an adjustment device it aids in setting the proper carburetor idle mixture adjustment on emission controlled auto- motive engines. 700101. Instrumentation for Precise Measurement of Motor Vehicle Fuel Consumption. Joseph C. Michałowicz, The Catholic University of Amer- ica. A photo-electronic fuelmeter has been developed to meet the need for a dependably accurate, precision instrument for measuring motor vehicle fuel consumption under either static or dynamic test conditions. It is useable under all operating conditions encountered either on city streets or turnpike highways. Automotive fuelmeters heretofore available have not been satisfactory for use in studies of vehicle fuel consumption as affected by highway and traffic conditions for one or more reasons. This new instrument is a continuous sampling system which retains the advantages of the buret type of fuelmeter but uses an electronic means for detecting and presenting, as simple digital readings, actual fuel consumption information. The basis instrument is useable for gasoline-powered vehicles and, with the addition of an auxiliary device called a deductor, is equally useful with diesel-powered vehicles. The fuelmeter may be coupled with a device for meas- uring distance travelled and thus provide miles-per-gallon information. 700102. A Technique for Reduction of Axle Generated Noises. Dan Hajduk, Cadillac Motor Car Div., General Motors Corp. Vehicle "axle noise" resulting from the resonant vibration of rear suspension and driveline components was meas- ured and then reduced by changing their structural properties. No changes were made to the rear axle assembly to achieve the noise reductions. Mesh frequency and twice mesh frequency response measurements of the rear control arms, axle housing, and propeller shaft correlated exactly with vehicle noise periods. Structural stiffness and mass changes to these com- ponents with the effect on noise and vibration response is presented. A description of the eventual production hardware which attenuated "axle noise" to an acceptable level is also presented. 1970 SA E Transactions 700103. Visual Communication: A Study of Symbols. Henry Dreyfuss Graphic symbols have always been used to help design and build machines. How they are helping people operate these machines, safely and economically, is shown.

Evaluation of Vehicle Exhaust Gas Odor Inten- sity Using Natural Dilution. Joseph M. Colucci and Gerald J. Barnes, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. A considerable amount of public exposure to vehicle exhaust odor results from municipal operation of diesel- powered buses, especially during the bus-stop sequence. Panel test procedures were developed for field evaluation of full-scale vehicle exhaust odor intensity during the idle and acceleration portions of a simulated bus-stop se- quence. The tests were conducted indoors in large buildings. Panelists placed at various distances from the vehicle made yes-or-no-decisions on whether they could detect an odor above the background level. 700106. Diesel Exhaust Hydrocarbon Measurement - A Flame Ionization Method. Karl J. Springer and Harry E. Dietzmann, Southwest Research Insti- tute. The design and development of an instrument for the measurement of toal hydrocarbon in diesel exhaust are described, and its ability to measure steady-state and transient hydrocarbon emissions is indicated. The two- section system comprises a sampling train and flame- ionization detector and a Chromatograph electrometer and recorder and backpressure regulator. A mixture of 40% H2 and 60% He was found to be the best fuel for low 02 response with the system. The method has been used for more than a year in evaluating hydrocarbon emissions from a wide variety of diesel engines under a number of typical operating conditions. The greatest advantage of the high-temperature system is its potential for expressing the total hydrocarbon content in diesel exhaust. 700107. Effect of Engine Intake-Air Moisture on Exhaust Emissions. W. J. Brown, S. A. Gendernalik, R.</page><page sequence="16">700108-700113 V. Kerley and F. J. Marsee, Ethyl Corp. Res. Labs. As atmospheric humidity increases, the emission of NO from automobiles decreases. This effect is so large that a factor for correcting observed NO to some standard humidity is desirable. Emission tests were conducted at 76 F and at four humidities on a fleet of eight passenger cars in accordance with the Federal test cycle. A derived equation relates the concentration of NO (measured by continuous trace analysis in accordance with the proposed 1971 California procedure) to differences in air moisture at the time of the test. Factors are also included to correct NO concentrations measured during other types of operation and to correct hydrocarbon and carbon monox- ide emissions measured during a Federal Cycle.

Daniel, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The relative importance of several internal environmental factors known to affect the hydrocarbons exhausted by an engine has been studied using an analytical model of the emission process. Results obtained by empirically fitting the model to measured exhaust hydrocarbon concentra- tions for systematic changes in five operating variables indicated that different environmental factors predomi- nated in causing the different variable effects.

An Analytical Framework for the Study of Exhaust Manifold Reactor Oxidation. Richard C. Schwing, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. A mathematical model has been formulated which accounts reasonably well for experimental observations made on the steady-state performance of an insulated exhaust manifold reactor when connected to a single- cylinder engine. The model, which is based on chemical reaction kinetics and energy balance considerations, predicts the effects of air-fuel ratio and dilution air quantity on the reduction of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons in engine exhaust gas. This paper includes a description of the model development, a discussion of qualitative relationships, and a comparison of quantitative predictions made from the model to experimental results.

The Allison AT-540 Automatic Transmission for Trucks. R. M. Tuck, Allsion Div., General Motors Corp. Market studies show there is a strong need for an automatic transmission for trucks in the 10,000 to 27,500-lb GVW class. After the area of the truck market is defined, the design of a new automatic transmission - the Allsion AT-540 - is presented. The transmission's func- tion, arrangement, and features are described. Also, the development program implemented to qualify the transmission for the market is discussed. Of significant interest is the durability test program, wherin a maximum of experience is obtained during this period of development. The data accumulated during the development test program indicate the objectives stressed during the design of the transmission - durability, performance, and cost - were fulfilled. 700111. Spicer SST-Custom Engineering a New Series of Heavy Duty Truck Transmissions. G. L. Myers and D. L. Cutts, Spicer Transmission Div., Dana Corp. A new series of truck transmissions has been developed with the intent of customizing the ratios to the engine and the job. Two years of laboratory and field testing has been completed on these transmissions, proving their reliability and performance. This paper covers the development of a new series of heavy duty truck transmissions utilizing the split torque concept of power flow. A chronicle of the development is set forth, as well as an assessment of the most salient features of this series of transmissions. A statement of the present status of the transmission series also is presented. 700112. Adaptive Anti-Lock Braking - A Reality for Air Braked Vehicles. Bruce E. Latvala and Robert J. Morse, Bendix-Westinghouse Automotive Air Brake Co. A braking control system for air braked vehicles has been developed which prevents wheel lock under any braking condition and thereby improves vehicle stability and reduces stopping distance. The theory of operation and the specifications of the system are discussed and performance under several typical conditions is shown. 1970 SAE Transactions 700113. Controlled Rotation of Braked Wheels. Gordon W. Yarber and Franklin B. Airheart, Hurst/ Air- heart Products, Inc. Automatic skid control provides the rotation control needed to stop a wheeled vehicle safely through a control system which senses wheel speed, has con troT logic, and controls braking torque. This paper describes how these essential control functions are used on the vehicle. Skid or rotation control can be provided for all braked wheels, either on an individual or paired wheel control 91</page><page sequence="17">700114-700120 92 basis, if maximum safety of vehicle operation is the primary consideration. If the major objective is to prevent complete loss of vehicle control, rotation control on the rear wheels only, either individual or paired, will be satisfactory, realizing, however, that steering control is lost when the front wheels lock up. To determine the final configuration, the performance as related to vehicle stability, directional control, stopping distance, tire damage, and relative cost must be evaluated. Depending on the requirements, cost can vary almost 300%; therefore, a compromise in the specified requirements may be necessary. 700114. Make the Trucks Stop, Too. Michael J. Denholm and Frederick E. Lueck, Borg &amp; Beck Div., Borg-Warner Corp. John W. Bush This paper discusses the brake performance of air-braked trucks and combination vehicle relative to deceleration and stability. The Available means for improving the performanace are Covered, including recommendations based on maximum cost effectiveness. Methods discussed are the use of load-sensitive proportioning valves and skid control, with the study of tractor installations as a prelude to more widespread usage of either device. Related areas of interest are also considered, such as the vehicle modifications that may be required to permit the use of these brake controls, the benefits of tractor installations on interchange vehicles, and the relative merits of load-sensitive proportioning valves and skid control when so applied. 700115. Boiling Heat Transfer Enhancement Using In- tegral Fins Inside Tubes. J. K. Jones, Oak Ridge National Lab. Research to improve heat transfer in once-through boiler-dryer superheater tubes for space powerplant application may prove useful in the design of boilers for automotive steam powerplants. Data obtained in ex- periments with four tubes with different internal fins are compared with results for a plain tube. The performance of the finned tubes in these dryer-superheater ex- periments, in which a water-steam mixture at 35 psia was used as the coolant, indicates that a substantial reduction in once-through boiler length can be realized by their use. 1970 SA E Transactions 700116. The Effect of Swirl Flow Upon the Performance of Monotube Steam Generators. J. R. Peterson, General Electric Co. Steam heat transfer and pressure loss correlations and a thermal design procedure are presented which permit automotive steam generators to be designed on a local basis both with and without swirl generating boiler tube inserts. Example designs with and without inserts are analyzed for a boiler producing steam at 1500 psia and 1100 F. The results obtained show the boiler tube with insert would operate approximately 100 F cooler than a tube without insert or alternatively, the tube without insert would be 50% longer for the same wall temperature. Limited parametric calculations indicate that an advan- tageous boiler arrangement is one in which the evapo- rating region is located near the hottest combustion gases with the superheater region near colder combustion gases. This arrangement would result in boiler tube wall temperatures approximately 100 F cooler than a counter- flow arrangement. 1970 SA E Transactions 700117. Una-Spray Burner - An Advanced Burner for External Combustion Engines. R. E. Bedford, Rocke tdyne Div., North American Rockwell Corp. An advanced, multiple-fuel burner concept is presented and the current development status of the burner is summarized.

Future application of the burner to external combustion engines is discussed. 700118. Control of Mobile Steam Powerplants. A. P. Fraas, Oak Ridge National Lab. The control of small mobile Rankine cycle powerplants presents a number of problems that are much more difficult than they at first appear. This paper attempts to present a review of the basic performance characteristics of typical individual components, the control functions and requirements of the powerplant, the control systems used in typical powerplants, and some new concepts that show promise of giving simpler, less expensive, and more reliable control systems for typical Rankine cycle systems. 700120. Where Closed Rankine Cycles Fit - With Ex- amples of Automotive APS and Portable GPS. John Bjerklie and Beno Sternlicht, Mechanical Technology, Inc. Rankine powerplant advantages are found to fit best applications that call for long maintenance free life, or where the heat energy is essentially free as in bottoming and topping cycles, or in special environments as undersea or space. Worthy applications suggested on the basis of potential market size and ability to satisfy customer imposed cost and performance are: automotive and tank accessory power systems (APS), transportable refrigera- tion, portable power supply (GPS), standby power, remote site power, and home air conditioner drive. The auto- motive APS and a 1-1/2 kWe GPS are further analyzed. The APS can offer attractive features to the automobile user, including the possibility of reducing pollution from spark ignition engine. The GPS is an example showing high cost effectiveness for long operating times. It is recommended that marketing and cost studies continue, and that working fluid and heat exchanger technologies be accentuated.</page><page sequence="18">700121-700127 700121. Whirling of a Four-Cylinder Engine Crankshaft. Ross K. Brown, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works.; and Charles R. Mischke, Iowa State University. A John Deere Model 3010 engine, a 4-cyl, three- main-bearing, four-stroke Otto-cycle in-line engine, was used in tests measuring crankshaft strains and the deviation of flywheel motion from plane rotation about the axial centerline of the main-bearing bores. The crankshaft was run with a 50 lbf and a 127 lbf flywheel at 0.006 in. diametral main-bearing clearance over a range of 2000 rpm to 3000 rpm engine speed under no-load conditions. The flywheel exhibited a first-order, forward whirl for all test conditions. Crankshaft stresses were not signif- icantly affected by either the flywheel mass or the main-bearing clearances.

Simplified Design Criteria for Expansion Cham- bers for Two-Cycle Gasoline Engines. Gordon P. Blair and Mervyn B. Johnston, The Queen's University of Belfast. Pressure-time diagrams taken near the exhaust port of a 2-cycle engine provide valuable insight into the per- formance of the power unit. The optimum phasing of the scavenging and plugging pulses are then observable from these diagrams. Unsteady flow gas dynamic theory, with the arithmetic handled by a digital computer, will predict the phasing and amplitude of these important exhaust pulse reflections at any engine speed, in any exhaust system, for any engine. Design of such an exhaust system for a projected engine unit or an existing design becomes a real possibility, thus saving valuable development time and money. Discussion: K. F.

Constant section elements are to be found throughout today's automobile. Included in this classification are structural members drip rails, windshield and backlight molding, and decorative body moldings. In designing these elements, as in most engineering design problems, the task is twofold. First, we have the creative aspect of the job which establishes the general shape or character of the design. This is followed by the detailed design definition. The basic problem in establishing a man- computer "design" team, where the man provides the creativity and the computer completes the details, has been the development of an effective interface between the two. With the advent of interactive graphic consoles, the interface has been provided whereby an affective man-computer team can be established. To be more specific, constant section elements can be designed by a man-computer team which uses an interactive graphic console as the communication medium. Furthermore, a better design ensues as the man is free to pursue more different designs due to the computer's ability to provide the geometric details much faster than the designer could conventionally. 700126.

Tractive effort and braking loads must also be handled easily by these bearings. This paper includes a brief description of present day rear axle designs and their bearings. It also includes a complete discussion of the design objectives of a new concept in single row tapered roller bearings and of the design features of this new bearing. The new bearing is preadj usted and carries thrust loads in either direction, as well as radial loads in any combination.

Throughout the automotive industry, a great deal of effort is being directed toward developing power transmission packages which are compact, reliable, lightweight, and which permit a maximum utilization of available space. A patented, high velocity chain called Hy-Vo is being tested and applied with a view toward fulfilling these require- ments in a variety of automotive applications. This paper discusses the design, development and current applications of this chain as it applies to these principles. 700129. A Practical Approach to Filtration for Hydraulic Systems. A. R.

More sophisticated hydraulic and hydrostatic transmis- sion systems are finding their way into aviation, farm, construction and industrial equipment. Because of the greatly increasing interest in these systems, this paper presents a general look at their applications. It traces the history of the fluids used in these systems. Finally, it presents a summary of the requirements for the fluids used in these systems today. 700131. Rod Scrapers for Earthmoving Equipment. H. H. Flock and I. L. McMillen, Garlock, Inc. With the boom in road and building construction since the early 1950's there has been a strong demand for increasing numbers of larger and more efficient earth moving equipment. Greater equipment efficiency de- manded developments in hydraulic cylinders in the form of higher pressure capabilities, longer strokes, more demanding tolerances and finishes, and better materials. Environment also has influenced cylinder design, leading to significant developments in protective devices and materials. Black oxide, chrome plating, protective oils, boots, wipers, and rod scrapers are some examples. This paper deals with two of these protective devices - wipers and scrapers. It explores the history and design considerations under which the wiper used in the cleaner atmosphere has given way to a more specialized scraper designed for use in abrasive environments. It traces the development of the standardized bonded polyurethane scraper through laboratory testing to today's severe application. 700132. Design Criteria for Thin Wall Zinc Die Castings. Bernard K. Dent, Sheller-Globe Corp. The product designers of zinc die castings have been using outdated technical information relative to minimum wall thickness possible with modern die casting techniques. Large decorating zinc die castings are currently in volume production with average wall thicknesses of 0.045 in. and local areas as low as 0.030 in. Case studies are detailed on four production die castings. Material cost savings on one casting could exceed $80,000 compared to product design with conventional wall thickness of 0.060 in. minimum. The value engineering concept is recommended to the designer as a guide for evaluating minimum acceptable wall and rib thickness, and boss diameters. Research programs are underway to provide design and production data for future zinc die castings. 700133. Superplastic Zinc-Aluminum Alloys in Automo- tive Applications. Louis T. Feng, General Motors Corp.; and David T. Camp, University of Detroit. Three ranges of zinc-aluminum alloys, (1) 88 wt.% Zn, 12 wt.% Al; (2) 78 wt.% Zn, 22 wt.% Al; and (3) 30 wt.% Zn, 70 wt.% Al, with copper, magnesium and manganese additions up to 3.0, 1.0, and 0.2 wt.%, respectively, were investigated. A thermal decomposition method of obtain- ing a fine microstructure to achieve "Superplasticity" is presented. The effects of alloying element additions, solidification rates (graphite mold versus sand versus continuous casting), annealing time (up to 72 hours), aging time and temperatures (75 F, 20 hr and 200 F, 2 hr), and mechanical working were determined. Correlations between these effects were made with reference to current metal deformation theories aided by electron microscopic studies, x-ray micro-probe and computer analysis. A closed-die forming process was achieved and demonstrated, using alloys and heat treatment cycles developed in this study. 1970 SA E Transactions 700134. What You Can Get in Zinc Coated Steels. E.

A Comparison by Thermal Analysis of Rotor Alloys for Automobile Disc Brakes. R. M. Rusnak, H. W. Schwartz and W. P. Coleman, Research Labs., The Bendix Corp. The effect of rotor alloy composition on thermal condi- tions in a disc brake system was determined analytically. The three alloys selected were gray cast iron, 356 aluminum, and copper- 1% chromium. This study includes calculations of the temperature and heat storage in the various portions of the brake system, as well as the variations of convective heat transfer throughout the system. These computations were made for the transient conditions existing during a series of 60 mph stops (15 ft/sec2 deceleration). The steady-state rotor surface temperature and the thermal gradients were found to decrease with increasing thermal conductivity of the alloys. The rotor surface temperatures for the first two stops were relatively independent of thermal conductivity, but were strongly dependent on heat capacity. Convection was found to occur almost entirely (greater than 90%) from the rotor surface and ventilating passages. Discussion: Robert N. Noyes and Paul T. Vickers, Res.

Rhee, Research Labs., The Bendix Corp.; J. L. Turak, Brake &amp; Steering Div., The Bendix Corp.; and W. M. Spurgeon, Research Labs., The Bendix Corp. Drums made of a chromium copper alloy, an aluminum alloy/cast iron composite, and convential cast iron were compared by inertial dynamometry, using full size linings in a Non-Servo brake system. The tests were performed with three types of linings; nonabrasive, moderately abrasive, and highly abrasive. In each test, 30 stops were made from 40 mph and 30 stops from 60 mph, using a rotational inertia of 31.4 slug-ft2. Temperatures near the lining/drum interface, hydraulic line pressures, and lining wear were measured and compared. For a given amount of work, the temperature rise near the drum surface was found to be lowest for the chromium copper drums, next lowest in the aluminum alloy /cast iron composite, and highest in the cast iron drums. This confirms earlier test results from drag dynamometry, using 1 inch by 1 inch samples. The average temperature rise decreased linearly with increasing thermal diffusivity of drum material. Some surface changes were found on all three types of drums: martensite spots on the cast iron and the aluminum/cast iron composite, and work hardening on the chromium copper. The latter have the advantage of being free from metallurgical transformations in the temperature range encountered in service. The chromium copper drum with the highly abrasive lining showed the greatest increase in surface roughness. All other combinations showed only a small change in roughness. The mildly abrasive linings showed the lowest wear rate with all three types of drums, in agreement with earlier results. 1970 SA E Transactions 700139.

Superalloy P/M Components for Elevated Tem- perature Applications. S. H. Reichman, B. W. Castledine and J. W. Smythe, Federal Mogul Corp. The use of a powder-metallurgy approach to modern superalloys for high temperature applications are dis- cussed in terms of better homogeneity and formability. The use of inert-atmosphere atomized powder results in dense alloy products with low interstitial content and with mechanical properties equivalent to or better than the cast or wrought form of the alloy. The advantages and disadvantages of the various densification processes are presented, with direct-powder extrusion or direct-powder forging to the dense product being the most attractive. Experimental results are given showing two extreme structural conditions obtained for direct-extruded P/M superalloys: the first is an ultra-fine grain structure which exhibits superplastic behavior; the second arises from a thermo-mechanical treatment which results in extremely large grain sizes, in some cases - single crystal structures which exceed the stress-rupture prop- erties of the cast and wrought alloys. 95</page><page sequence="21">700141-700147 96 700141. Aluminum P/M Parts - Their Properties and Performance. J. H. Dudas and K. J. Brondyke, Alcoa Res. Labs., Aluminum Co. of America. This paper discusses the mechanical properties of preci- sion P/M parts produced from aluminum alloys 201 AB and 601 AB and presents data on their corrosion resistance, wear performance, and machinability. The properties and characteristics of aluminum P/M materials are compared with iron P/M, brass P/M, and aluminum die castings. Alloy 201 AB develops ultimate tensile strengths up to 50,000 psi and provides a desirable combination of strength, ductility, impact and fatigue properties in a lightweight economical P/M material. Alloy 601 AB achieves moderate strengths of 35,000 psi with superior corrosion resistance, high thermal and electrical conduc- tivity, and has the ability to accept many attractive finishes. Both alloys can be machined at high cutting speeds to a smooth surface finish after heat treatment. In the T6 temper they possess high wear resistance approach- ing that of aluminum die cast alloys. These new aluminum P/M compositions have unique product properties providing the powder metal industry with broad new capabilities in many design applications. 1970 SAE Transactions 700142. Surface Finish Analysis Through Analog Tech- niques. Denzil L. Hammond, Chrysler Corp. Many users of stylus type surface measurement instru- ments have occasions when, for economic reasons or special tests it is necessary to analyze a surface in a manner other than that for which their instruments are specifically designed. Several methods are described in which, through the use of additional standard instruments or simple elec- tronic circuits, the stylus type instrument can be used for a wide variety of surface analysis techniques. 700144. Surface Finish Testing - The Present State- of-the-Art and Its Future. Eric J. Schneider, Engis Equipment Co. The paper describes the present acceptance of surface texture measuring instruments in use in the United States giving recent statistical data related to other measuring techniques and machine tools used in the manufacturing process. It then deals with the significance of surface roughness measurement and its hoped-for relation to part function with recent statements of available correlation. Recent trends in the United States, Europe, the Far East, and behind the Iron Curtain describe broadly the relation between America and foreign efforts in the field. The necessity to carry the stylus instrument to its ultimate perfection, to consider nonstylus instruments for surface texture in their proper place, and the challenge of 'surface quality and surface integrity' are described, as is the future need to relate surface quality measurement to other part measurements required for comprehensive part description. 700145. Oxides of Nitrogen from Smaller Gasoline En- gine. Kiyoshi Matsumoto, Tadahide Toda and Hidetaka Nohira, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd., Japan. The new California regulations governing emission of oxides of nitrogen from automobile exhausts present a special problem to small engine manufacturers, for little of the available data enable them to satisfy the requirements and still produce vehicles that have maximum power output and maximum fuel economy. This report provides essential information for designers and alerts them to the danger of adverse effects on engine and vehicle per- formance resulting from the usual corrective measures of rich mixture, retarded spark timing, and exhaust gas recycling. Engine modifications and an effective gas recycling method are suggested in this report to alleviate these undesirable side effects. 700146. Evaluation of Exhaust Recirculation for Control of Nitrogen Oxides Emissions. W. Glass, F. R. Russell and D. T. Wade, Esso Research &amp; Engineering Co.; and D. M. Hollabaugh, Na- tional Air Pollution Control Administration. Exhaust gas recirculation was found to be a promising approach to NO emission control when used in con- junction with either engine modifications or manifold air injection to control hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. NO reductions of about 60% were achieved with minimal debits in fuel consumption, driveability and CO and hydrocarbon emissions. Long-term effects remain to be established. 700147. Synchrothermal Reactor System for Control of Automotive Exhaust Emissions. W. Glass, D. S. Kim and B. J. Kraus, Esso Research &amp; Engi- neering Co. An experimental "Synchrothermal" system with very low exhaust emission levels was developed based on duPont thermal exhaust manifold reactors. Rich fuel-air mixtures were used to decrease nitrogen oxides. Recirculation of a controlled amount of exhaust gas under selected operating conditions further decreased nitrogen oxides. Injections of air synchronized with individual exhaust valve opening promoted more complete combustion of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Acceptable reactor temperatures under high-speed operation were maintained by diverting some of the injected air to the intake manifold. Muffler back pressure and a fixed recycle line proportioned the exhaust recycle which was injected between the carburetor venturi and the throttle plate. Recycle flow was blocked off during idle, wide open throttle and choked operation. Composite exhaust emission levels below 0.3% carbon monoxide, 10 ppm unburned hydrocarbons and 150 ppm nitrogen oxides were obtained by the federal test pro- cedure. Fuel consumption data indicating a fuel penalty</page><page sequence="22">700149-700156 of 16% were obtained from extended runs on a mileage accumulation dynamometer.

King, Engineering Staff, Gen- eral Motors Corp.; and Harold R. Schneider and Robert S. Tooker, Oldsmobile Division, General Motors Corp. General Motors cars and light trucks for 1970 are equipped with improved Controlled Combustion Systems (CCS) or Air Injection Reactor (AIR) exhaust emission controls. An added feature on most vehicles is Trans- mission Controlled Spark (TCS) which extends the idle spark retard schedule for further emission reduction. Cars sold in California are also equipped with an Evaporation Control System. A canister of activated carbon adsorbs and stores fuel vapor when the vehicle is not being used. Reactivation of the carbon occurs during vehicle operation, when the stored vapor is purged from the canister and metered into the engine where it is burned. 700150. Chrysler Evaporation Control System - The Vapor Saver for 1970. J. O. Sarto, W. S. Fagley and W. A. Hunter, Product Planning &amp; Devel- opment Staff, Chrysler Corp. A system for controlling gasoline evaporation losses from 1970 model Chrysler Corp. cars and light trucks was developed, certified for sale in California, and put into production. Evaporation losses from both the carburetor and the fuel tank are conducted to the engine crankcase for storage while the engine is shut down. The vapors are removed from the crankcase and utilized in the combus- tion process during subsequent vehicle operation. Par- ticularly interesting in this unique, no-moving parts system, are the reliability and durability, and the vapor- liquid separator 'standpipe.' Discussion: Paul E. McKee, Ford Motor Co. 1970 SAE Transactions 700151. The Chrysler Cleaner Air System for 1970. R. E. Goodwillie, N. M. Jacob and E. W. Beckman, Chrysler Corp. For the 1970 model passenger cars and light trucks, the Federal and California exhaust emission standards were reduced to 2.2 grams per mile hydrocarbon and 23 grams per mile carbon monoxide. This represents a reduction of approximately 33%. This paper presents the development of the significant features of the Chrysler Cleaner Air System of exhaust emission control for 1970. Included in this development are modifications in the engine, carburetor, ignition system, and other related components. Through these modifications and by optimizing the calibration of the engine operating parameters, the new exhaust emission standards were successfully met. 700153.

The development of an automotive brake test stand has required the design of a highly responsive hydraulic system in order to provide acceptable dynamic control of brake line pressure. This paper describes the analysis, simulation, and performance optimization of the elec- trohydraulic pressure control system built for this appli- cation. A hybrid simulation employing a patterned search algorithm was used to determine the compensation network yielding the optimum system response to a step input. Solution time comparisons between hybrid, digital, and analog simulation methods are made, and the relative advantages of each are noted. Finally, a comparison between the simulation and some experimental results indicates the validity of the analytical procedures em- ployed. 1970 SAE Transactions 700154. A Hybrid Computer System for the Simulation of Vehicle Dynamics. Ray W. Murphy, University of Michigan. Simulation of the dynamics of pneumatic tired vehicles often severely strains the capabilities of ordinary analog and digital computers. This paper shows why a hybrid computer, combining the best features of both the analog and the digital, is ideally suited to vehicle dynamics simulation. The elements of a typical modern hybrid computer system are outlined, and the rationale behind the specification of such a system for vehicle dynamics simulation is given. 700155. A Hybrid Simulation of Vehicle Dynamics and Subsystems. N. O. Tiffany and G. A. Cornell, Bendix Research Labs.; and R. L. Code, Stanford University. A seventeen degree of freedom hybrid computer simu- lation of the automobile has been developed to allow the dynamic study of simultaneous large amplitude per- formance, cornering, and ride motions. This simulation, capable of running in real time, combines the speed of the analog computer to solve the differential equations of motion with the accuracy of the digital computer to perform coordinate transformations and to compute the nonlinear tire forces. 700156. Hybrid Computer Simulation of Vehicle Direc- tional Control. Richard W. Valentine, General Motors Corp. This paper discusses the use of hybrid analog-digital simulation in vehicle design analysis. A hybrid program for the design application of nonlinear directional control analysis is described. This program combines the non- 97</page><page sequence="23">700157-700165 98 linear tire properties, suspension analysis, and vehicle dynamics into an efficient design analysis package. 700157. Analog Simulation as a Design Tool for Advanced Braking Concepts. G. B. Hickner and D. W. Howard, Bendix Automotive and Automation Co. An analog computer simulation development for a passenger car foundation braking system is presented. A brake control system is added to the simulation. As the hardware for the brake control system is developed it is substituted into the simulation along with components of the foundation brake system. This mixture is a "physical simulation" where the analog simulation is reduced to represent only the vehicle and the road with appropriate interface elements for the actual brake and control system hardware. The discussion includes the studies conducted using physical simulation for tolerance study of vehicle char- acteristics as well as the foundation brake system and control system parameters. Results which validate the model are presented. In conclusion, the advantages of this approach which supports the development of an advanced brake control system are discussed. 700158. Climate Control System Simulation Using a Digital Computer. O. Conklu, Ford Motor Co. This paper presents mathematical models of automotive climate control systems. A simulation technique which uses a digital computer is described. The heater and air-conditioning system simulation models are discussed. Correlation of these models with the test data are given and examples of design applications of the models are also presented. The technique which combines basic theory, with a set of test data and a digital computer, gives results within 3-7% of tests results and thus provides a useful and effective design tool. 1970 SAE Transactions 700159. Performance Tests of a Small High-Speed Steam Engine. C. V. Burkland and C. R. Halbach, CCI Aerospace Corp. Performance test of a small, high-speed, uniflow steam engine (expander) are described and theoretical and experimental results compared. The engine delivered a maximum of 10.7 hp at 2100 rpm with superheated steam, at 230 psi. A minimum steam consumption rate of 23.2 lb/hp-hr was measured at 40% cutoff with 590 F superheated steam. The mechanical efficiency of the engine was determined as 92% and overall engine efficiencies of over 70% were measured. Problems in the engine design uncovered in the tests involving the valve arrangement for short cutoffs are discussed. 700160. Performance of a 35 hp Organic Rankine Cycle Exhaust Gas Powered System. Erwin Lodwig, Fairchild Hiller Corp. An organic Rankine cycle system utilizing waste exhaust gas heat from a 30 KW gas turbine generator set has been built and tested. Utilizing a new fluorocarbon fluid, the system furnishes 18.9 KW of additional electrical power output along with 120,000 BTU/hour for air heating and 190,000 BTU/hour for water heating for environmental control. The primary gas turbine engine fuel control furnishes the speed control for the mechanically locked-in Rankine turbine and permits fuel saving operation under power sharing conditions from full load to idle conditions. This system concept provides electrical energy output at a fuel consumption rate approaching that of the diesel set but at a small fraction of the diesel set weight. 700162. Some Developments in Small Recriprocating Rankine-Cycle Engines Using Organic Working Fluids. E. F. Doyle, T. LeFeuvre and R. J. Raymond, Thermo Electron Corp. Thermo Electron's development program on Rankine- cycle engines is reviewed. Intake valve losses are shown to be an important aspect of engine efficiency, particularly with organic working fluids. Experimental data on engine indicated efficiencies are presented, and show values to 80%. These results were demonstrated in an engine with less than 1.0 CID. 700163. The Design Features of the GM SE-101 - A Vapor-Cycle Powerplant. P. T. Vickers, C. A. Amann, H. R. Mitchell and W. Cornelius, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The continuous combustion of the vapor-cycle powerplant offers the potential for low levels of exhaust pollutants. While this engine did not survive the competition of an earlier era, it needs réévaluation in terms not only of modern technology, but also of modern transportation requirements. This presentation describes the design and construction of a steam powerplant for a current pas- senger car. 1970 SAE Transactions 700164. Fuel Systems for Recreational Vehicles. Daniel L. Donovan, Tillotson Manufacturing Co. The selection of a fuel system for recreational vehicles requires a survey of all conditions that affect the flow of fuel mixture to the engine. The consideration of the carburetor as a separate entity related only to the engine does not fulfill the requirements of successful vehicle operation. All components from the air inlet to the exhaust outlet, and from the fuel tank to the engine inlet port, have a definite effect upon fuel mixtures. Tests showing the variations in fuel flow resulting from apparently minor changes in air inlet adaptors and exhaust header lengths illustrate the necessity of fuel system coordination with the completed end product. 700165. Engineering the Diaphragm Carburetor for Small Chain Saw Engines. Kenneth C. Schneider, Walbro Corp.</page><page sequence="24">700166-700173 A departure from conventional diaphragm carburetors used in chain saw engines was needed to obtain an improved deceleration (come-down) from full throttle to idle, a balanced idle system to eliminate fuel collecting in intake manifold or crankcase, and improved acceleration. The carburetor described in this paper has the conven- tional pluse operated fuel pump, inlet valve, and metering diaphragm. However, the fuel circuits were modified to provide trouble-free performance with no rich underrun, long idling period, and quick acceleration. 700166. Extracting Data from the Agile Fork Truck. M. Charles Kuepfer, Clark Equipment Co. Various methods of acquiring fork truck performance data under actual driving conditions are discussed, including the use of radio telemetry and a van equipped with instruments. Testing procedures, applications, and description of the equipment used are given in detail. 700167. Designing and Testing to Meet Safety Code Requirements for Powered Industrial Trucks. Oswald S. Carliss, Eaton Yale &amp; Towne, Inc. This paper traces the development of safety standards, codes and specifications for industrial trucks. Programs conducted by private companies, industrial trade organ- izations, and the military are discussed.

Process Techniques of Billet Strand Casting. R. L. Bunting and W. Wójcik, Roblin Steel Co. The development of process techniques during the last six years and the commercial application of these techniques in Roblin Steel Co.'s continuous casting plant at Dunkirk, - N. Y., is presented and discussed. These techniques are used to produce carbon and low alloy steel cast billets which are rolled into rod and bar product used in the hot and cold forging and extrusion industries. 700169. The Production of Superior Quality Continuously Cast Steel. J. E. Fogarty, Republic Steel Corp. Facilities have been developed and put into operation for continuous casting of aluminum-killed steel using con- ventional melt practices. A vertical-type billet machine was installed which casts 200-ton heats in approximate 120 minutes, into four 42-in. long, water-cooled, copper molds, at a rate of 44 in./minute/strand. After casting 10,000 tons of alloy and carbon steel billets, results show the material is better than conventionally cast steel in surface quality, chemical uniformity, and internal clean- liness. 700170. Properties and Performance of Continuously Cast Steel Sheet for Automotive Applications. S. H. Kalin, H. M. Al worth and H. R. Hollmann, U. S. Steel Corp. This paper covers the development and operation of a continuous-strand casting machine. It also compares the working characteristics of continuous-cast Riband I steel to those of ingot cast rimmed and capped steel. Benefits include higher slab yield, longer slab lengths, and shorter process time. Performance in automotive applications is described. 700171. Coherent Optical Data Processing Technology. Gary D. Cochran, CFC Products, Inc. The purpose of this paper is to present a brief discussion of the fundamental processes of coherent optics which can be used to perform mathematical operations such as Fourier Transformation, bandpass and bandstop filtering, convolution, and cross correlation. A cylindrical optical system presented can simultaneously process many chan- nels of data. Coherent optical computers are compared with digital computers and problem areas in optical instrumentation and parameter specification for optics are reviewed. Brief comments are made on the possibility of utilizing a coherent optical computer in developing a vehicular diagnostic system. The objective of the system is to analyze signals received from sensors located on the vehicle and pinpointing parts which are malfunctioning. At the present time the general solution to this problem is not available. 700172. Central Data Collection and Processing with Emphasis on Emissions Data Reduction. Robert F. Spain, Y. George Kim and Russell V. Fisher, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. The General Motors Research Laboratories has installed a data acquisition and control computer to be time-shared with a variety of test programs. These include vehicle emissions evaluations, safety studies, transmission inves- tigations, metallurgical processes and materials devel- opments. Many special interface systems have been designed to enhance the computer's compatibility with a variety of test requirements. Expandable remote scanning systems have been developed and manual input and computer display systems were designed to minimize the engineer-computer communication problem. Special ve- hicle emissions programs were developed utilizing the basic hardware and software systems projected for the overall Research Laboratories operation. 700173. Further Investigations in Vehicle Dynamics. Edward Saibel, Carnegie-Mellon University.; and M. C. Tsao, Oxford University. A further investigation of a pneumatic tire vehicle is performed. The model used is a four wheel pneumatic tire vehicle given by Saibel and Tsao. It consists of a main system, the car body, together with four small subsystems, the wheels. It gives a dynamic system of ten degrees of freedom (4 tire deflections, 4 spring-shock absorber deflections, the roll angle, and the pitch angle of the car body). Tire-force equations are presented. This nonlinear 99</page><page sequence="25">700174-700181 100 dynamic system may be used to study the behavior of the vehicle under any transient inputs. In the present investigation, a controlled cornering on flat and sinusoidal road surfaces is given. The characteristics of tire deflec- tions and spring shock absorber deflections and skidding conditions are examined. 700174. The Economics of Automotive Weight Reduction. K. D. Mashall, The B. F. Goodrich Research Center. By reducing the weight of an automobile, monetary savings accrue to both the auto makers and the American consumer. The consumer receives a benefit in reduced initial purchase price, reduced freight charges, increased gas mileage, and reduced tire wear. Assuming that a car will last for six years and will travel 18,000 miles per year, it can be conservatively calculated that a reduction of 1 lb in the weight of the vehicle will save the consumer $0.76 over the lifetime of the car. By including inflationary effects, it can be calculated that the consumer would save $0.79 over the lifetime of the car, or $0.13 each year. 700175. A Study on Automobile Crashworthiness. Masanori Tani, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.; and Richard I. Emori, University of California. Crash mechanisms of automobile were simulated by a nonlinear, three-degrees-of-freedom system. Crashworth- iness of vehicle structures were obtained analytically, as well as experimentally, and represented by nonlinear springs. Analytical results were compared with full-size experiments of barrier and rear-end collisions. It was shown that the automobile crash mechanisms may be explained by a simple model, and that a theorectical computation may be feasible to obtain the crashworth- iness of vehicle structures. 700176. Vehicle Trajectories After Intersection Collision Impact. Richard I. Emori and Masanori Tani, University of California. The post-collision motion starts immediately upon com- pletion of a collision impact where the vehicles obtain new sets of velocities through an exchange of momentum. Similtude with model study and full-scale automobile experiments indicate that the post-collision trajectory is essentially a plane motion, governed by inertia and tire friction. Trajectories depend on many parameters (such as tire friction coefficient, front wheel steering angle, vehicle geometries, and whether wheels are locked or free to rotate) but not on the vehicle weight. Theoretical com- putation of trajectories is compared with experiments. 700177. Vehicle Mechanics of Intersection Collision Im- pact. Richard I. Emori, University of California. There are two phases in automobile collisions, namely, impact phase, which is treated in this paper, and after-collision phase. As indicated by full-scale ex- periments in unidirectional collisions, and as confirmed by similitude model study in side impact collisions, vehicles behave as rigid bodies in both impact and after-collision phases. With this confirmation, the analyses of seemingly complex intersection automobile collision phenomena become possible by application of 2-dimen- sional impact theories which are primarily based on the momentum-impulse principle of rigid bodies. Available full-scale intersection experiments indicate the numerical range of the coefficient of restitution and coefficient of friction between two vehicle bodies in collision. 700178. Load Sharing Among Planet Gears. D. L. Seager, Westinghouse Research Labs. An approximate theoretical analysis of loading in a simple planetary gear system is presented for both the case where one central gear is not centered and the case where both central gears are centered. Numerical examples are used to compare the two types of arrangement, and to demonstrate the amount of load unbalance which may occur in practice. A possible method of improving load sharing is suggested. 1970 SA E Transactions 700179. A New Automotive Jack. Roy L. Orndorff and James Sidles, The B. F. Goodrich Co. Changing a flat tire no longer need be a chore if the Newmatic jack is used. The Goodrich jack is a compact, inflatable, textile, and rubber cylinder capable of ex- tending vertically to lift a vehicle wheel off the ground. It is stable and easy to operate. Inflation pressure for most standard-sized cars is in the range of 20-25 psig. The inflation source can be a compressed gas bottle, a compressor driven by the engine, or an electric motor driven compressor plugged into the cigarette lighter. The Newmatic jack can be stored within the spare wheel. In today's automobile with limited storage space and uncertain lifting methods, the Newmatic jack offers the chassis engineer considerable freedom of choice. 700180. Torsonal Vibration of a Rotating Tapered- Twisted Turbomachine Blade. R. M. Krupka and A. M. Baumanis, Continental Aviation and Engineering Corp. This paper treats the torsional vibration of a rotating tapered and twisted turbomachine blade. Carnegie's formulation of the LaGrange equations of motion is used and the set of field equations solved using Myklestad's adaptation of the Holzer method. Digital computer results are presented for a particular turbine blade, demonstrat- ing the convergence of the method and the satisfaction of the boundary conditions of the problem. The equations and methodology required to construct a digital computer program, in order to obtain a numerical solution to the problem, have been derived. 700181. Applicability of Statistical Energy Concepts to the MM'69 Spacecraft. Mom taz N. Mansour, Jet Propulsion Lab., California Institute of Tech- nology.</page><page sequence="26">700182-700188 Analytical methods of estimating damping and coupling factors, necessary to analyze structural vibration using statistical energy concepts, became very difficult for complicated spacecraft type structures. An attempt to investigate the applicability of statistical energy concepts to such a structure was made ex- perimentally employing system level random vibration tests on the Mariner Mars 1969 Dynamic Test Model. 700182. Automobile Emissions-A Study in Environmental Benefits versus Technological Costs. P. S. Myers Recent increase in man-caused additions to the atmos- phere are markedly changing its quality. With rising population, these additions will increase in the future. This paper discusses the magnitude of the overall problem in relation to mass rate balances, particulate matter, carbon dioxide- Nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, lead, and hydrocarbons. Pollution from automobiles is then dis- cussed specifically, along with some possible solutions (both with the existing reciprocating engine and alternate power sources), the effect of controls, and the long-term reduction of emissions. Methods of cooperation between government, man- ufacturers, and the public are suggested. 1970 SA E Transactions 700183. System Approach to Transportation. J. E. Gibson, Oakland University. The systems approach to a problem defines the goal and constraints on the problem and works backward to find the requirements these imply for the subsystems and lesser components. This paper deals with a California experience in socially relevant system engineering and with the system approach to transportation. For the latter, one must determine needs, examine alternatives, determine trade- offs, rank alternatives on a cost-effective basis, and iterate by restudying the chosen system on a deeper and narrower basis. 700184. Prospects for New Intercity Ground Modes. James R. Vadeboncoeur, TRW Inc. Further development of new and innovative transpor- tation technologies for intercity passenger service is dependent upon the resolution of certain remaining technological problems but, most importantly, upon the assessment of their economic viability. This paper outlines the critical elements of this assessment, with emphasis on the role of transportation system planning. Some of the initial results of the service design of baseline configu- rations of high-speed rail and tracked air cushion systems in the Northeast Corridor of the United States are presented as example outputs of the planning process. 700185. High-Speed Railway Transportation Today and Tomorrow. Alan R. Cripe, Sikorsky Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. The present generation of high-speed trains in various parts of the world has demonstrated improved perform- ance and increased passenger and shipper patronage. Their performance is compared to the technical per- formance of future high-speed rail vehicles likely to be developed in the next decade. Market data and economic projections are analyzed to determine the cost and performance level trade offs for future generation trains and their likely competitors. An assessment of the overall impact to society is made regarding the widespread application of high-speed railway technology in the future. 700186. The Courier: A Prototype Vehicle For Dial- A-Ride Service. K. W. Guenther and W. E. Givens, Ford Motor Co. Dial-A-Ride is a dynamically routed and scheduled transporation system which offers a door-to-door alter- native for those unable to use personal automobiles for all of their trips. Functioning as a public system it would economically replace conventional bus service in small and medium sized cities, or serve as a line haul transit feeder in larger cities. Additional applications serving major trip generators such as airports and shopping centers are also envisioned. This paper explains how Dial-A-Ride system would function. A prototype vehicle is described, which will be used in an ongoing evaluation and study program. It is a ten passenger luxury package, in keeping with the overall first class service image. All of the human engineering and safety features are explained in terms of actual service requirements. Modification of a standard automotive product insures low initial cost and low operating costs. The current prototype will be refined as field evaluation results are obtained moving us closer to the objective of an ideal vehicle for dynamically routed and scheduled public transportation systems. 700187. The Pressure for Transportation Balance. Victor W. Wigotsky, Design News. Unified planning across different transportation modes is essential to alleviate a mounting deterioration in urban mobility. Vitalization and integration of transportation elements and modes will be necessary to a much higher degree than is presently available or on the horizon. Bimodal vehicles, air-cushion suspensions, linear induc- tion motors, tube vehicles, STOL, VTOL and V/STOL are all part of the transportation "mix" being evaluated. The impact of electronics will be increasingly apparent in both personal and mass transit. These elements are discussed within a framework of today's realities and tomorrow's requirements. 700188. Do We Really Want to Stop Traffic Jams? Arthur F. Underwood, General Motors Corp. The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to the fact that traffic flow can be improved at relatively low cost by utilizing knowledge which already exists. Several specific examples are shown which would reduce traffic jams and improve motoring safety. Too much time and effort is being spent on 5% of the motorist's problems, compared to improving the needs of 95% of the motorists. 101</page><page sequence="27">700189-700197 102 700189. Safety and Service Applications of Citizens Two-Way Radio. Henry B. Kreer, REACT. About fifteen years ago, the Federal Communications Commission created a new classification of two-way radio to be known as the Citizens Radio Service. It utilized the AM mode at 11 m band. Since that time equipment size has been greatly reduced and numbers of units in operation have increaed radically. From individual re- porting of accidents, there has evolved a nationwide network of control centers. Most centers are manned on a voluntary basis; however, government and businesses are now setting up control centers. Ohio is initiating a test program in 1970. This program will have state and regional personnel and will work directly with the State High Patrol. The prospects for future expansion are good due to technological developments and increased interest by government agencies. 700190. Proven Ways to Reduce Congestion. Alger F. Malo, Dept. of Streets and Traffic, City of Detroit. Detroit uses many traffic engineering techniques and methods to reduce congestion and speed traffic flow. Success is most frequently obtained by use of a mix of methods on a single street. Streets have been widened and laned, traffic channeled with left turns restricted or prohibited, parking prohibited, and a flexible progressive signal system devised to accomodate heavy peak flow. Where congestion still exists, it is because funds are not available to apply the proper remedies. We recognize the automobile is here to stay, and that there is a solution to the traffic problem. 700192. Lincoln Tunnel Traffic Control Experiment. Denos C. Gazis and Brain T. Bennett, IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center. A description is given of a control experiment aimed at the development of a computer methodology for im- proving the flow of traffic through the Lincoln Tunnel of New York City. Some remarks are given on the potential spin-offs from this experiment which may influence the development of other traffic control systems. 700193. (SP-354) Parameters for Proposed Fifth Wheel Coupler Installation Practices. Gordon E. Cole, American Steel Foundries.; Charles R. Wreford, Dodge Truck Operations, Chrysler Corp.; R. N. Janeway, Janeway Engineering Co.; R. L. Teresinski, A. O. Smith Corp.; W. G. Dixon, Ford Motor Co.; L. F. McNitt, Midland Ross Corp.; J. Tipka, White Motor Co.; and Robert A. DeRegnaucourt, Dayton Steel Foundry Co. This special report serves as a background study leading to an SAE Recommended Practice for fifth wheel couplers. It is believed that establishing several stand- ardized fifth wheel coupler mounting or installation practices will improve safety conditions for hauling semitrailers. Limited to the size of vehicle equipped with SAE J700a kingpins, the study considers fifth wheel coupler force and geometry factors. Discussion: David A.

The basic variables and calculations of performance and fuel economy are discussed along with test data and recommended values for the parameters that are difficult to ascertain. A hand calculations technique and a computer program for simulating vehicle acceleration time, distance, and fuel economy is discussed. The text is intended as both a state-of-the-art presentation and a technical reference that extends beyond that presented in SAE J688, Truck Ability Prediction Procedure. 1970 SAE Transactions 700195.

States, The University of Rochester.; Alphonse R. Burdi, Charles F. Frey and Charles L. Votaw, The University of Mich- igan Medical School.; Lawrence M. Patrick, Wayne State University.; and Harold J. Mertz, General Motors Corp. Intended as a medical guide for practicing engineers, this book covers basic human anatomy, medical terminology, injuries, and human tolerances to impact. Chapters are: synopsis of anatomy and medical terminology; anatomy and physiology of the head and neck; facial injuries; musculoskeletal system; thoracic and abdominal anat- omy; trauma to internal organs; neuroanatomy, physi- ology, and clinical implications; human tolerances to impact. 700196. Why the Issue Is Loss Reduction Rather Than Only Crash Prevention. William Haddon, Jr., Isurance Institute for Highway Safety. There is no reason why highway loss reduction coun- termeasure priorities must parallel the rank of causes. Traditional emphasis only on crash prevention ignores major opportunities for reducing losses to damaged people and property. A standard method is needed for rating vehicles' occupant protection considering limits set by physics and body force tolerances. The use of structural damage for crash energy absorption, particularly at 5 to 20 mph, is archaic in comparison with aircraft strut design. It is predicted that the present, structural-damage approach to low speed energy absorption will soon become publicly unacceptable. 700197. Present Knowledge of Medical and Behavioral Factors in Highway Crashes: Options for Loss</page><page sequence="28">700199-700206 Reduction. Julian A. Waller, University of Vermont. Human factors are important in initiating crashes and in determining their outcome. However, in many cases inappropriate acts are complex behavioral phenomena, rather than simply voluntary events avoidable through better motivation. Furthermore, environmental factors as well play an important role in initiating these events, and are the major determinant of the severity of injury. Because of the extreme cost and limited likelihood for success in many areas of behavior modification, the first lines of attack must be lessening of driving demands, moderation of energy transfer, and improvement of rescue services. Modification of behavior is an important but supplementary approach. 700199. The Highway: Options for Loss Reduction. Teddy J. Hirsch, Texas A&amp;M University. Approximately 36% of the deaths and injuries on our highways result from single vehicle accidents. These accidents involve vehicles running off the road, over- turning, or striking some fixed object such as bridge piers, retaining walls and abutments, sign posts, lightpoles, trees, guardrails, utility poles, etc. This paper discusses some of the features of our roadways which present hazards to the motor vehicle which inadvertently leaves the pavement. Various alternatives or options which are now available for reducing accident losses are discussed. Recent devel- opments such as the breakaway sign post, lightpole, and vehicle impact attenuation devices are discussed. Sugges- tions for reducing the hazards of various other roadside features are also presented. 700200. The System: Key to Future Low Loss Operations. Henry H. Wakeland, National Transportation Safety Board. The National Transportation Safety Board study, Com- patibility of Standards for Drivers , Vehicles , and Highways , points out that the many standards which might define integrated highway transportation systems have often been incompatible. The result is that the standards tended to block conceptualization of system problems in highway operation and safety. Compatible standards involving many national organizations are needed to facilitate the evolution of integrated highway transportation systems. Safety efforts are often based upon corrections of individual causes of accidents, and problems are visu- alized separately. Better results have been achieved where the system could be visualized and disciplined as a whole. Efficiency is as great a goal as safety. SAE, as an engineering organization, could take a leadership role in creating compatible system-oriented standards. 700202. Computer Utilization for Aircraft Contour De- termination. Dean A. Bartle tt, Piper Aircraft Corp. A procedure has been established for the utilization of a computer to calculate coordinates of curves described by the second degree equation as used in defining the shape of aircraft components. Based on the same preliminary sketches and input data used in the graphical method of development, longitudinal basic lines and transverse contours can be quickly calculated to describe an entire three dimensional surface. The output data are utilized for currently established three dimensional mock-up tech- niques and hardware design. The paper presents the mathematical background and a complete explanation of the procedure used to develop a three dimensional surface. Design optimization, hardware design, and utilization of supplementary information are discussed. Appendices include the general computer program and a sample design problem. 700204. Designing for Maintainability in a Modern Three Spool Fan Engine. Y. J. Wilier, AiResearch Manufacturing Co. The modern turbofan engine has become a very sophis- ticated machine in an effort to produce the lowest possible cruise fuel consumption. This forces such design config- urations as variable geometry or the use of three spools which tend to severly complicate scheduled maintenance and fault isolation. A new turbofan engine now being developed by the Garrett Corp. for executive and commuter aircraft will provide a significant improvement in specific fuel con- sumption as well as maximum maintainability. The high performance is influenced by the advanced aspect of the engine design. This paper shows that it is possible to use the three-spool configuration to advantage by design innovation to arrive at an engine that can be easily maintained. Furthermore, it has been possible to produce in this design the capability for "on-condition" removal of modules of the engine so that overhaul can be established on the basis of condition rather than on a predetermined TBO (time between overhaul). The manner in which this has been achieved and the significance to the aircraft owner is reviewed. 700205. Tiara Light Aircraft Engines - A New Generation. William A. Wiseman and E. J. Ounsted, Teledyne Continental Motors. The paper introduces a new family of air-cooled, opposed, light aircraft engines consisting of four, six, and eight cylinders, with and without turbosupercharging. The paper explains an evolutionary approach to sizeable improvements in horsepower per pound of engine weight, horsepower per cu in. displacement, and horse- power per cu ft. of bulk. A unique method of torsional control eliminating pendulum dampeners and greatly reducing vibratory torque is also explained in detail. 700206. The Allison Model 250 Engine, A Case For the Small Turboprop. Elroy P. Neate and John J. Petraits, Allison Div., General Motors Corp. Allison has developed and obtained FAA type certificate for the Model 250 turboprop engine rated at 317 shaft 103</page><page sequence="29">700207-700213 104 horsepower. This engine has been flight tested in several experimental installations. Development of the engine to 400 shp is continuing. Weight savings from the lighter turboprop engine result in increased aircraft useful load; the reduced drag of the smaller turbine engine coupled with ram recovery and higher continuous ratings provide higher performance at comparable reciprocating engine power levels. These factors result in increased aircraft productivity and net worth to offset the higher price associated with the turbine engine. 700207. Low Cycle Fatigue of Jet Engines. Arthur M. Smith, General Electric Co. The object of this paper is to create an awareness of low cycle fatigue problems, the environmental influence of operational differences on parts life, the development of rotating part life limits, life limit increase methods, and the controls required for safe operation. The major life consumption parameters are defined. Correlation methods of relating actual operating envi- ronmental conditions to empirical and test data are presented. Direct measurement of operational differences, variations and configuration differences is made by techniques using an Electron Microscope. 700208. An Analytical Method for Estimating the Per- formance of a Gas Turbine Engine with Water- Methanol Injection. Peter M. Ardans and Donald W. Stephenson, AiResearch Mfg. Co. of Arizona. This paper presents an analytical method for the predic- tion of gas turbine engine performance augmented by water-methanol injection into the compressor, the com- bustor, or a combination of these injection points. Thus far, the basic method has been successfully applied to estimates of the augmented performance of a single-spool turboprop engine. However, it is general enough that it may be adapted to any type of gas turbine engine, including multispool turbojet, turbofan, and turboshaft engines. In addition to a description of the basic method itself, a comparison of tested and analytical results is included in support of the procedures and conclusions involved. 1970 SAE Transactions 700209. Engine Performance for the Business Jets. Lawrence D. Smith, Lear Jet Industries, Inc. The pilot flying one of today's business jets has a high precision tool at his command. Some of the same basic principles of flying piston-powered airplanes still apply; however, with the jet engine he is faced with revising some of his operating and handling techniques. These changes in techniques have been brought about by increased engine thrusts, increased speeds, longer range, and higher altitudes. It is the purpose of this paper to explain some of these new characteristics associated with the high performing jet engine, such as, engine ratings, installation effects, operating limitations, thrust setting procedure, engine performance, engine check-out and testing, and airplane range. The interrelationship of these characteristics is dis- cussed to show the importance of proper engine operation so the operator can gain maximum performance from the business jet. 700210. CRT Displays for Business Aircraft. D. D. Korell and D. F. Schmidt, Collins Radio Co. The Advanced Instrument Group at Collins Radio Co. has conducted feasibility studies of advanced technology displays for flight control instruments. This report summarizes the results for CRT (cathode ray tube) displays in business aircraft with emphasis upon the EADI (electronic attitude director indicator). Display concepts and philosophy are discussed, along with engineering and human factors considerations of EADI's. Some characteristics of EADI's and current electromechanical designs are compared. Other possbile applications of CRT displays in the cockpit are presented. 700211. Starting Aircraft Engines with the Nickel Cad- mium Battery. August B. Mundel, Marathon Battery Co. The methods of selecting the optimum battery for aircraft starting are outlined with emphasis on the starting of jet turbine engines. In addition to a description of the method of analysis, the care of nickel cadmium batteries is described under various conditions of use with details of on and off aircraft maintenance procedures. Specific examples of results encountered under adverse envi- ronmental conditions are used to develop the methods of obtaining optimum service life and maximum reliability. 700212. Generator Regulation for Increased Ni-Cd Bat- tery and Generator Life. Charles L. McMurry, Maricopa Controls, Inc. Under severe service, Ni-Cd battery life is shortened considerably as a result of being recharged at a high rate while at elevated temperature. In addition, generator life is shortened by the practice of "cross-firing"--using the generator of the first engine started to help the battery start the second engine. Experimental results illustrating these operational problems, and their magnitude, are shown for two modern typical aircraft. These problems are alleviated through use of a new type regulator which (1) senses battery temperature and reduces charge rate as temperature increases, and (2) limits the maximum generator output. This device is described and service test results are discussed. 700213. Flight Control Systems for the Smaller Business Aircraft. C. C. Bath, Avionics Div., The Bendix Corp. Smaller business aircraft operators cannot afford the cost</page><page sequence="30">700214-700220 and weight of autopilots and flight directors used by business jets. Several innovative techniques are described which have contributed to the design of low-cost, lightweight flight control systems having performance equivalent to that of the larger equipments. 700214. Systems Aspects of Area Navigation. Paul G. Wulfsberg and Jerry C. Schmitt, King Radio Corp. Area navigation systems are now becoming available to aviation after twenty years of spasmotic development culminating in the advisory circular on area navigation published last August. Impetus for implementation of area navigation has come from a number of sources; among them are the increased density of aircraft traffic, the desire of pilots to navigate directly to locations without navi- gation aids, the increased sophistication of aircraft useage and, indirectly, the desire for more accurate and stable VOR receivers. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss the advantages area navigation systems hold for the aircraft pilot, the flight control systems, and improved navigation accuracy through rejection of VOR course scalloping. The logical future extensions of area navi- gation into vertical navigation computers will also be discussed. 700215. Design and Installation Considerations for Min- imizing Electromagnetic Interference (EMI). Denys G. Fredrickson, Gates Lear Jet, Inc. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is a severe problem area confronting design and installation engineers of electrical and electronic equipment. This paper outlines several of the many EMC problem areas confronting the aircraft manufacturer when installing and interfacing various types of electrical and electronic equipment. It also provides some design criteria that will minimize EMC problems if applied during the design and installation of the equipment. 700216. The Complementary Roles of Analysis and Test- ing in Aircraft Structural Substantiation. Carroll R. Bigham, Lockheed-Georgia Co. In the structural design of modern aircraft it is vital that the best possible judgment be excerised in distinguishing between those areas of the design which can be adequately proven by analysis and those which are best developed and substantiated by test. Knowledge gained over the past few years from the design and development of two large jet cargo transport aircraft, as well as service experience from other transport aircraft, is reviewed for the purpose of gaining additional insight into this very complex problem. The overall structural design process, involving determination of external loads and stiffness requirements as well as detail strength and fatigue substantiation, is discussed. An effort is made to summarize some of the more important advancements in analysis technique which have come about as a result of computerization. The prospects for further improvements in these techniques are dis- cussed. Data is also presented to illustrate the role of design development by testing and the relative merits of this approach in lieu of analysis. Finally, a correlation of analysis and test data derived from airframe component and full scale testing is presented and discussed. 700217. Coupling of Substructures for Static Structural Analyses. Mike H. Abla, Lear-Jet Industries, Inc. This paper presents a study of the current state-of-the-art in the matrix analysis of complex redundant structures by the substructure approach. The analysis deals with the process of subdividing a system into substructures that are treated separately and synthesizing these again to obtain the elastic properties of the complete system. The synthesis is accomplished in accordance with the re- quirements of the force equilibrium and deflection compatibility at the substructures common joints. An example problem is worked out in an attempt to demonstrate the application of the method. 700218. Finite Element Structural Analysis Using Com- puters. Everett, L. Cook, Wichita State Univ.; and Donald R. Goldberg, Beech Aircraft Corp. The direct stiffness method of matrix structural analysis is presented and its use is illustrated by an example. A prior knowledge of matrix algebra is not required. The results of the analysis of two thin-wall box beams are presented and compared with experimental results. The effects of root fixity are emphasized. 1970 SA E Transactions 700219. Fatigue Evaluation for Light Twin-Engined Air- craft. Jon M. Huffman, Cessna Aircraft Co. In the past, most light twin-engined aircraft have been designed based on the fail-safe concept. The use of these type aircraft by commuter airlines indicates that a safe-life evaluation of the structure can be of use to both the manufacturer and the customer. This paper describes a program to evaluate the safe-life of a light twin-engined aircraft. The program presently being applied to the Cessna Citation executive twin jet aircraft is also pre- sented as an example of the application of the safe-life concept to an aircraft developmental program. 700220. Lightning Strikes to Plastic Components of Light Aircraft. J. D. Robb and M. M. Newman, Lightning and Transients Research Institute. The trend toward much greater use of general aviation aircraft under all weather conditions for instrument flight almost certainly suggests a greater amount of lightning damage and possible hazard from lightning discharges. Many years of experience in observing lightning problems on commercial transport aircraft (one lightning damage report per year per aircraft) indicates the areas of possibly serious problems. The techniques obtained from lightning protection development programs on nearly all commer- cial aircraft are often directly applicable to general 105</page><page sequence="31">700221-700229 106 aviation aircraft but require careful, intelligent application and, most important, an awareness, particularly by structure and fuel systems designers, of the possible problems. 700221. Bonded Aircraft Structures for General Aviation. Norman F. Steiner, American Aviation Corp. Adhesive bonding offers structural efficiency, lower weight, reduced production costs and improved appear- ance to the general aviation industry. To achieve these advantages, the design and production techniques must be geared to the product operational environment and cost limitation of the general aviation industry. 700222. Loading Conditions Measured During Aerobatic Maneuvers. Albert W. Hall, NASA, Langley Research Center. A flight test program has been conducted to determine some of the loading conditions experienced in aerobatic maneuvers. A small aerobatic airplane was instrumented to measure three components of linear acceleration, three components of angular velocity, control surface positions, control stick forces, airspeed, and altitude. The magnitude of various loading parameters, singly and in combination, are discussed and used as a basis for assessing some of the structural design requirements for aerobatic category airplanes. 1970 SA E Transactions 700223. Development of a New Slip-Ringless Propeller Blade Measurement System. Marvin J. Walker, Federal Aviation Administration. A new system for acquiring, transmitting, and recording the steady-state and vibratory stresses from multiple strain-gage locations on a propeller during flight and ground operation has been developed and tested. The system eliminates conventional slip rings and increases data capacity. The data system employs a 16-channel FM multiplex to transmit information across a single capacitive coupling and is self-powered through the rotary motion of the test propeller. In addition, an RPM/phase reference signal, digitally encoded time signals, and seven channels of aircraft operating parameters are accom- modated. 700224. Air Conditioning Considerations for Turboprop Commuter and Business Aircraft. Howard R. Semsroth and Robert C. Kinsell, AiResearch Manufacturing Co. The advent of turboprop-powered aircraft designed for the commuter and business aircraft market has resulted in a need for air-conditioning systems optimized to the characteristics of this class of aircraft. Relative merits of various systems are discussed with particular emphasis placed on the interface between air-conditioning and main propulsion engines. Means of conserving bleed air are extraction at certain critical aircraft operating conditions. The means of properly matching the air-conditioning system to the cabin air distribution system is also briefly discussed. 700225. Recent Advances in Fuel Management Systems for Business Aircraft. Douglas Stuart, Simmonds Precision Products, Inc. The new fuel management system described in this paper provides accurate and comparable measurement and display of fuel quantity on board, fuel flow rate, and flight time remaining at reasonable economy. This system provides the pilot with immediate data concerning his entire fuel system, with an accuracy not previously approached by any commercially available system. The system has been designed for economical manufacture, which makes the system competitive on any twin engine or larger aircraft. 700227. Personality of Nickel-Cadmium Batteries. C. T. Clark, Lockheed-Georgia Co. Nickel-cadmium batteries fill a great need in the aircraft industry today. This battery is far superior to its predecessor, the lead-acid battery, in its ability to provide power for larger electrical loads and/or loads sustained for long periods. Yet, aircraft operators have experienced many unexpected problems with this battery. These problems can be greatly reduced, if not eliminated, through a better understanding by the design engineer of the battery's construction, abilities, and limitations. Further improvements in performance can be accom- plished by the aircraft operator through constant and proper maintenance. 700228. Bureau of Mines-API Survey of Aviation Gaso- lines, 1969. C. M. McKinney and O. C. Blade, Bureau of Mines, U. S. Dept. of the Interior. Inspection data are reported for 67 samples of three grades (80/87, 100/130, and 115/145) of commercial aviation gasolines produced in the United States during 1969. The results are compared with similar data for gasolines produced during 1964, the last year for which such data are available, and with recently revised specification requirements of the American Society for Testing and Materials. 700229. Getting Along at the Major Terminals - General Aviation and the Airlines. Michael V. Huck, Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. It is possible to efficiently provide for all types of aviation activity in major terminal areas. Achievement of this goal is dependent on adequate planning efforts, based on accurate forecasts of total traffic and a breakdown of the total into three general aviation segments: airline and heavy jet, light jet and high performance piston, and light single engine. A natural segregation of these three types of traffic will be accomplished by the provision of different types of airports designed to serve the needs of each user group.</page><page sequence="32">700230-700237 700230. Low-Cost Nav-aids for Low-Density Airports. Paul B. Glassco, Federal Aviation Administra- tion. VHF and UHF Nav-aids are available or are being developed which can bring modern IFR procedures to many low density airports at a cost much lower than standard ILS or VORTAC. One of these is low-powered, solid state TVOR. Another is DME, of comparable design. Equipment features and performance of both are discussed, as well as the localizer-and-marker system. Visual aides are briefly treated. 700231. Design of General Aviation Airports and Heli- ports. George L. Buley, Federal Aviation Ad- ministration. The Federal Aviation Administration is responsible for the development of technical criteria for general aviation airports and heliports. The procedures used in developing these criteria are described. Also, current recommended standards are reviewed by airport category, citing the latest information available. The way in which an individual or an organization can participate in the establishment or modification of airport standards is explained. 700232. Styling and Interior Developments in General Aviation Aircraft. Harold H. Russell, Beech Aircraft Corp. The design, manufacture, and marketing of general aviation aircraft is a highly sophisticated business. Since technical knowledge is available to all companies, some other means must be found to stay competitive in the market place. Styling and its related functions have been major areas used by the automotive industry to achieve this advantage. General aviation has begun to follow this example and must place greater emphasis on it in the future. Today, most buyers of executive airplanes expect and even demand a personalized vehicle. This can be done on a production line basis while maintaining a reasonable price structure and delivery schedules. Every advantage must be taken to increase production quantities by commonality between models. One of the areas in which this can be done is seating, with model distinction being obtained by the addition of trim. 700233. The Importance of Styling and the Use of Materials in Aircraft Interiors. T. G. Baroth, North American Rockwell Corp. In the not very distant past, interiors were put into the aircraft after everything else had been accommodated. As a corollary, interior designers were called in, if they were called in at all, after everyone else had done his work. However, the general aviation industry under the stimulation of competition and the example set by other consumer oriented industries, notably the automotive industry, has come to recognize that the passenger is paramount and, since his needs and desires must form the basis of marketing policy, the physical expression of these needs and desires must be the platform on which the airframe design is based. This paper examines: the function and organization of an industrial design de- partment, styling as a marketing tool, and the use of materials in aircraft interiors. 700234. Human Factors in Aircraft Interior Design. Christopher L. Lair, Aerosonic Corp. Dark colors make a small space seem smaller. Light colors make it appear larger. Blue and green suggest a tranquil surrounding and red causes one to anger more easily. These are human reactions to confined interiors. The first part of this paper examines human-envi- ronment interactions which are present in aircraft. The second part discusses sorting and classifications of factors by the engineer. 700235. A Fixed Base Engineering Flight Simulator for General Aviation Aircraft. H. L. Walter and A. K. Agnihotri, Beech Aircraft Corp. This paper describes a fixed base engineering flight simulator that has been built and tested at Beech Aircraft Corporation. The computer portion is general purpose analog so that any aircraft may be defined. Comments concerning the equations of motion and those used to describe airplane aerodynamics and power effects are included. The aircraft cockpit used for the simulation is described in the paper as well as the computer and its contribution to the system. A three axis control force fell system has been developed at relatively low cost to provide pilot control forces. 700236. Determination of Performance and Stability Parameters from Nonsteady Flight Test Maneu- vers. O. H. Gerlach, Delft University of Tech- nology. The paper describes a flight-test method yielding per- formance data and certain stability and control char- acteristics from measurements in a nonsteady symmetric flight- test maneuver. Test performed according to this method provide: rate of climb as a function of air speed at a fixed power setting, elevator angle to trim in steady straight flight, elevator angle per g in steady turning flight, the respective neutral and maneuver points stick-fixed, and, finally, the polar drag curve and a set of stability and control derivatives. A significant reduction in flight-test time appears to be possible by using this method. The tests to be described were aimed at ascertaining the re- peatability of the results from the nonsteady maneuvers and at comparing the results with those obtained from tests in steady flight. 700237. Correlation of Small-Scale and Full-Scale Wind Tunnel Data with Flight Test Data on the Lear Jet Model 23. Ronald D. Neal, Gates Lear Jet Corp. One of the basic questions arising from any small-scale 107</page><page sequence="33">700238-700242 108 wind tunnel test is the relationship of the low Reynolds number results to the high Reynolds number character- istics that will be encountered on the actual airplane. This paper presents a direct comparison of longi- tudinal low-speed small-scale wind tunnel data, full-scale wind tunnel data, and flight test results. These data were obtained from tests on a 0.15 scale model of the Model 23 in the Wichita State University 7 X 10 ft wind tunnel, full-scale wind tunnel tests on a Model 23 in the NASA Ames 40 X 80 ft tunnel, and Lear Jet flight test results on Model 23 and Model 24 type airplanes. Since flight test data for the flaps down configuration are rather limited, most of the wind tunnel to flight comparisons are for the flaps up configuration. The results indicate good agreement between wind tunnel and flight test results for the flaps up configuration. Comparison of small-scale data with full-scale flaps down wind tunnel data shows definite areas of disagreement for identical configurations. 1970 SA E Transactions 700238. A Method for Analyzing Power-On Static Lon- gitudinal Stability. Roger L. Marr, Beech Air- craft Corp. A general method for analyzing static, longitudinal, stick-free, and stick-fixed stability is presented. The method allows for analysis of several configurations and effects of power on the stability of the airplane. A single matrix equation is used in which the total airplane lift, drag, pitching moment, hinge moment, and downwash are used to obtain the airplane stability. The equations include the effects of auxiliary control devices generally used on general aviation aircraft such as downspring, bobweight, geared tab, and nonlinearities of control surface gearing. 700239. The Response of Small Business Aircraft to Continuous Atmospheric Turbulence. Ellwood L. Peele, NASA, Langley Research Center. A method is presented for estimating the lateral and longitudinal response parameters employed in the design load calculations. Estimates of load factors, tail surface loads, and motion responses for both the longitudinal and lateral-directional excitation may be made for aircraft such as the light general aviation class and the small business jets. The method involves the use of data charts of response integrals which are parametrically related to the aircraft stability parameters, short-period or Dutch roll frequency and damping ratio, and a gust-to-aircraft scale parameter. Sample calculations are included to illustrate the use of the method. 1970 SA E Transactions 700240. An Assessment of Performance, Stability, and Control Improvements for General Aviation Air- craft. J. Roskam and D. L. Kohlman, University of Kansas. A parametric investigation was made to determine which aerodynamic design modifications can be made to improve significantly the performance of light airplanes. The study was made around a typical low wing and a typical high wing airplane. Performance parameters selected for comparison with the baseline configuration are: speed for best range, maximum level speed, specific range, maximum rate of climb, and speed for maximum rate of climb. It is shown that significant improvements in these performance parameters are possible by aerody- namic refinements. It is also shown that by application of modern high lift technology significant improvements in take-off and landing performance can be obtained. A similar analysis was employed to improve stability and handling characteristics such as spiral stability, dutch roll stability, and gust response. By applying a recently developed method of coupling spoilerons into the control system more precise flight path control is achieved during final approach. Several features of the control system are discussed, and computer- generated time histories are presented. 1970 SA E Transactions 700241. Cessna Citation Design Factors and Philosophy. James B. Taylor, Cessna Aircraft Co. In this paper, we have tried to develop the concept that any new aircraft design cannot be the result of only a single discipline. It required the devotion and cooperation of three distinct segments of the organization: engi- neering, marketing, and corporate. The implication, of course, is that, without all three segments operating in unison, the probability of failure (defined as poor market acceptance) is quite high. The idea is proposed that, in the general aviation area, the design specification must be developed around the needs of the market. Therefore, the role of market feedback becomes quite important and the marketing organization is the most logical choice for developing and interpreting this feedback. A very brief look at the Cessna CITATION program is used as an example of this design process. Several unique approaches to satisfying the original specification are briefly discussed and the development of a well- defined engineering/marketing interface is described. It is concluded that the future success of Cessna designs will be totally dependent upon how well we can interpret and serve the needs of the general aviation market. 700242. The Development of American Aviation Cor- poration's Yankee. William C. Seidel, American Aviation Corp. A successful approach to reducing light aircraft cost has been realized by American Aviation Corp. in the devel- opment of the two-place Yankee. Emphasis is placed on the problems and solutions derived from this development which provided the path for success of this project. The Yankee is the first general aviation aircraft to use adhesive bonding as its primary structural fastener.</page><page sequence="34">700243-700249 700243. A General Aviation Operator Views His Equip- ment. G. Courtney Chapman, Ohio State Uni- versity. Each new model change usually brings improvements over earlier models. From the point of view of increasing window area and designing more pleasing appointments, there have been significant advances. With regard to engine reliability and time between overhauls, significant advances have also been made. Solutions to some of the other problems, however, have made little gains. Examples are pilot sitting position and ease of seeing outside the cockpit area, noise level for effective verbal communications between instructor and student, and shoulder space for instructor and student in trainers. An area where major strides are yet to be made is in panel, cockpit, instrument, and control layout and function. A continuing concern expressed by pilots is the transition time from one aircraft to another or the problems of regularly operating in two or more aircraft. This suggests that there is a need to provide more commonality between airplane layouts. Since the hourly maintenance labor costs are increas- ing, the original design should consider labor-saving methods during routine inspections such as accessible location of battery. Performance data and aircraft systems descriptions should be more uniform between manufacturers. 700244. A Flying Club and Its Lesson. Carl Behrens, Air Travel, Inc. Sky Roamers and its members have found general acceptance and are pleased with the equipment that it operates. Experience with this equipment has, however, revealed areas where improvements should be developed to improve even further the service to owners and operators. The Sky Roamer lesson is to provide members good equipment at reasonable rates. It requires a well-organized friendly organization with trained and dedicated per- sonnel wherein safety that doesn't come by accident is the prime factor. 700246. Future Equipment Requirements of the "Fixed Base" Operator. Robert F. Gunnell, Gunnell Aviation, Inc. General aviation has grown to its present status in the business community due, largely, to the evolvement and development of the aircraft and related products in current use. The expansion of general aviation in the future will, even more than in the past, be dependent upon the continued development, improvement, and refinement of equipment which will provide rapid, versatile, compatible, dependable, and economical transportation for the flying public. This paper discusses some of the areas of desired development as viewed by a "fixed base" operator. 700247. Automotive Safety in Review. Harry F. Barr, 1970 SAE President. This paper broadly surveys the continuing research and development by automotive engineers in designing safer automobiles. Door latch redesign, seat belts, energy absorbing steering columns, laminated windshields, en- ergy absorbing instrument panel and its knobs and levers, dual brake systems, seat back impact absorbing tops, head restraints, and bias-ply tires are among the improvements discussed. Passenger restraint remains the most important factor in saving lives, however, and the public has been careless in using such systems. Passive restraints, such as the air bag, are under development. The need for good driver training programs, the problem of alcohol, and the need for continuing improved highway design are also touched upon. 1970 SAE Transactions 700248. Automotive Air Pollution Control. Harry F. Barr, 1970 SAE President. This paper presents a general outline of the air pollution problem in the United States, with particular emphasis on the contributions made by the internal combustion engine. The reductions obtained in hydrocarbon, and carbon monoxide emissions by recent control systems are out- lined. Alternate powerplants are mentioned, along with the problems of obtaining sufficient power if the United States were to switch to electric vehicles. SAE's continuing concern and activity in the area of emission control is described. 700249. Measuring Gaseous Emissions from an Aircraft Turbine Engine. J. O. Chase and R. W. Hum, Bartlesville Petroleum Research Center, U.S. Bureau of Mines. Aircraft turbine engines generate the same pollutants that are generated by automotive reciprocating engines, but problems of emission measurement differ greatly between the two types of engines. This is a discussion of experimental work done to define more clearly the character of the turbine emissions and to gain experience in sampling and measuring the emissions. An explicit objective was to evaluate the adequacy of available instrumentation and to reveal emission measurement problems unique to the turbine engine. Results of the study showed that concentrations of gas phase pollutants in the turbine exhausts ranged from about one to three orders of magnitude lower than average concentrations of the same materials in exhausts of late model (that is, 1960-69) autos. Instrumentation now available for measuring hydrocarbon, CO, and NOx is expected to be adequate but will require appropriate adaptation for measurements at concentrations typical for turbine exhausts. As is the case in automotive application, a method fully suitable for oxygenated materials is not yet available. 1970 SAE Transactions 109</page><page sequence="35">700250-700259 110 700250. Standard Smoke Measurement Method. G. P. Sallee, American Airlines, Inc. Air pollution control will reach the same level of research effort aircraft noise control has reached within the next several years. To determine progress towards reduction of pollution emission, meaningful standardized measurement methods must be employed to insure that data from various measurers are correlateable quantitatively. This paper summarized the activities of the SAE E-31 Com- mittee of Aircraft Exhaust Emission Measurement in developing a standardized method for measurement of smoke emission from aircraft engines. 700251. Compatibility of Gelled and Emulsified Fuels with Jet Transport Aircraft. A. T. Peacock and L. D. Christensen, McDonnell-Douglas Aircraft Co. The use of fuels thickened by gelation or emulsification has been proposed for reducing the hazards of fuel fires caused by aircraft crashes. This investigation was con- ducted primarily under a contract issued by the Federal Aviation Administration to determine the feasibility of utilizing gelled or emulsified fuels in a four-engine jet transport fuel system. A comparative screening of the rheological and physical properties of several modified fuels resulted in a selection of the most promising candidates for further study. A partial DC-8 (Model 62) aircraft fuel system was used in the test program to provide data for system analysis using the selected fuels. Results of the test program indicated that an unmodified commercial jet aircraft fuel system cannot effectively utilize the gelled and emulsified fuels examined. 1970 SAE Transactions 700253. Environmental Considerations and the Metro- politan Airport System. Dorn C. McGrath, Jr., The George Washington University. This paper examines the nature of the environmental challenge that airports face in the context of metropolitan area systems planning. The greatest problem is aircraft noise. This type of noise, which is immune from public regulation under traditional local powers, is not recog- nized adequately in planning for airports or nearby communities. Its effect on education is described, as is the question of housing development and industrial con- struction adjacent to airports. 700256. Fuel Tank Deposits in an SST Environment. G. E. Hays, The Boeing Co. Fuel temperatures resulting from the SST environment may cause Jet A kerosene to form solids which can adhere to fuel tank surfaces in localized areas. The environmental conditions influencing the formation and accumulation of deposits within the SST fuel tanks are examined and the potential problems with these deposits assessed. Methods of reducing the accumulation of deposits are investigated. The results of these investigations with the proposed SST fuel tank structure have led to the conclusion that the accumulation of deposits with Jet A kerosene fuel would not be excessive. 1970 SAE Transactions 700257. New Techniques for Measurement of Jet Fuel System Deposits. H. T. Henderson and A. C. Nixon, Shell Development Co. When hydrocarbons are exposed to high temperatures under heat-transfer conditions, deposits form on heat exchanger tubes. Estimation of the extent of fouling has relied upon visual examination of the coker tube, but the significance of this has long been questioned. In this paper are considered other possible ways of rating the deposits on coker tubes, including removal with solvents, com- bustion with 02, combustion with ozone/02, heat transfer effects, beta-ray backscattering, electron absorption, X-ray scattering, and infrared absorption. Results of all these experiments show that 02 combustion and beta-ray backscattering ratings are more reliable bases than is visual appraisal for evaluating hydrocarbon formation by jet fuels. 1970 SAE Transactions 700258. Morphology of Deposits in Aircraft and Engine Fuel Systems. R. M. Schirmer, Phillips Petro- leum Co. Deposits produced in a wide variety of fuel system simulators and fuel test rigs were found to be remarkably consistent in their microstructure. The deposits were built from soft particles measuring about 1000 Angstrom units in diameter. These microspheres form random three- dimensional structures on the deposit face, which become more closely packed in the deposit substrate, and undergo fusion on heated surfaces. It is postulated that thermal stressing generates micelles in the fuel, and that deposits are formed by the collection of these particles from the fuel. Therefore, it is proposed that a standard method of test for fuel quality control should evaluate the deposit potential of fuels, free from the collection efficiency of physical systems. The 5 ml Bomb Procedure, which is based on the decrease in light transmittance through the fuel when thermally stressed, appears to be suitable for this purpose. 1970 SAE Transactions 700259. Implications of Mechanical Systems on Airport Terminal Design. Walther Prokosch, Tippetts- Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton. The prime objective of the paper is to delve into Mechanical Systems - for people-movers, baggage-movers, cargo-movers - and explore the influence which these new devices may have on the design of major airports and air terminals. The major emphasis is placed on the aspect of moving people since this is where the greatest need appears to be required. The author proposes the establishment of four catagories of Mechanical Systems in order to bring the</page><page sequence="36">700260-700266 language of this new field into some systematic order. He proposes a definition of "Unacceptable Walking Dis- tance" since this determines the transition to mechanical devices. Although no specific or complete solutions are presented for new terminal designs based upon the use of Mechanical Systems, a number of potential approaches are explored; and benefits are cited which may accrue with their use. The belief is expressed that the aircraft apron is in serious need of "de-clutterization" - partic- ularly with the advent of wide-bodied jets; and that this can be accomplished by placing as much activity below ground as possible - by moving people, baggage, cargo as a starter. 1970 SA E Transactions 700260. Performance Standards for Intra-Airport People- Moving Systems. Charles B. Shields, Battelle Memorial Institute.; and Harry W. Lindell, The Richardson Associates. The performance standards that should be taken into account in specifying a batch-type people-moving system for intra-airport service are discussed. The basic system constraints are discussed with respect to their influence upon the nature and design of the system. The general requirements of the system and the specific requirements of the subsystems as well as certain contractor per- formance requirements that must be met in order to attain the highest quality transportation system possible are described. 700261. Studies for and Application of Mechanical Sys- tems at Paris-Nord Airport. F. L. Clinckx and J. P. Marcellin, Aéroport de Paris. This paper is intended to describe the electromechanical baggage handling and sorting systems with which the Roissy-en-France Terminal will be equipped, when it goes into service in 1973. Since the terminal will accommodate a million passengers each year, the problems of handling a heavy load of baggage traffic merited extensive planning of facilities and careful choice of equipment. Therefore, special project and development studies on these systems were conducted by the Equipment Department of the Paris Airport Authority Engineering Division. This work and the systems evolving from it are meticulously reported here. 700262. The Challenge of Aircraft Crash Fire Rescue. Earl W. Keegan, Flight Safety Foundation, Inc. This paper provides a review of the current airport fire-fighting equipment and requirements. Statistics are offered concerning the inadequacies of such equipment at many airports served by air carriers and suggestions are made for improving the situation. The latest available fire-fighting equipment and fire-fighting agents are detailed as well as that equipment programmed by manufacturers for future use. The author also offers ideas and concepts on fire- fighting tactics that could be employed today, and those to meet future airport needs. 700264. The Use of Launching and Arrestment to Reduce Land Area Requirements for Airports. Donald B. Doolittle, All American Engineering Co. Improvement of landing and takeoff safety, with the use of runway launching and arresting systems is discussed. Navy aircraft carrier experience is the basis of projecting the safety of runway operation with commercial aircraft. Significant saving in takeoff runway length, and all weather landing in lengths now required for dry runways is projected. Conventional and STOL airports using launching and arresting gear are discussed. 1970 SA E Transactions 700265. New Methods for Rating, Predicting, and Alle- viating the Slipperiness of Airport Runways. Walter B. Home, NASA Langley Research Center.; and Howard C. Sparks, Wright-Patter- son Air Force Base. The age of jumbo jets and supersonic aircraft begins in the 1970's. These new aircraft will be considerably more expensive and capable of carrying many more passengers than the aircraft they replace. New methods for rating, predicting, and alleviating the slipperiness of airport runways are required to reduce the possibility of costly and even catastrophic accidents occuring to these and other aircraft on slippery runways. For the past year, the USAF and NASA have been conducting a cooperative runway research program on runways in the United States and Europe. The slipperiness of over 40 runways having different surface treatments has been rated under dry, wet, slush, snow, and ice conditions by means of an instrumented four-engine jet transport and an instrumented automobile. It is shown that measurement of the stopping distance of a diagonal-braked automobile provides a meaningful measure of the slipperiness of a wet runway and permits accurate prediction of the stopping distance of an aircraft, as well as realistic calculation of crosswind limitations. It is also shown that stopping distance on a wet runway can be considerably improved either by grooving the runway or by use of a porous surface course. 1970 SAE Transactions 700266. Engine Selection Problems for Jet Powered Ultra STOL. D. H. Axelson and G. G. Upton, The Boeing Co. This paper discusses the effect of engine size and cycle on two types of Ultra STOL aircraft. One type, a powered lift plus deflected cruise thrust vehicle, is analyzed to determine the effect of wing loading, cruise engine and lift engine thrust loading, number of lift engines, and cruise engine bypass ratio and turbine inlet temperature on airplane gross weight and cost at a 1000-ft field length. The other type, a conventional nondeflected thrust airplane, is analyzed to determine the effect of wing ill</page><page sequence="37">700267-700272 112 loading, thrust loading, engine bypass ratio and turbine inlet temperature on airplane gross weight and cost at field lengths from 1000 to 2000 ft. Results of this analysis indicate that powered lift aircraft are not cost competitive unless field lengths of 1000 ft are considered. 1970 SA E Transactions 700267. Advanced Military Transport Engines. James N. Krebs and Peter G. Kappus, General Electric Co. The purpose of this paper is to examine the propulsion system requirements of military and commercial trans- ports, review their impact upon design and development decisions, and anticipate the trends of convergence or divergence of requirements in future transport systems. Two transport systems will be considered: the first generation of high bypass turbofan transport propulsion systems represented by General Electric's TF39 and CF6 engines, and the most likely next generation of advanced technology transport powerplants for STOL, VTOL, and CTOL medium transports operational in the post- 1976 period. 700268. Military/ Commercial Aircraft Propulsion Rela- tionships. William H. Sens and Robert M. Meyer, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. This paper discusses the interrelationship between tur- bojet and turbofan engines used in military and com- mercial service. This relationship has evolved from the modification of military engines for application to the initial commercial transport aircraft to the present where some engines have been designed from inception to meet commercial transport requirements; a trend is resulting from the commercial transport engine market growing enough to justify new engine developments to meet its specific needs in some cases. There are future military and commercial propulsion requirements, however, where the anticipated market may not be sufficiently large or firm to provide the basis for a new development, for example, a medium size commercial or military STOL aircraft. Proper planning could provide the basis for development of a powerplant that would satisfy both military and commercial requirements; in fact, use of common engines may be necessary to provide a production base large enough for STOL or VTOL engine development and production to be economically viable. The J57/JT3, J75/JT4, J60/JT12, and J52 turbojet engine; and the TF33/JT3D, and the JT8D turbofan engine programs are reviewed to show the mutual benefits that have resulted from the use of a common basic powerplant. The JT9D engine developed specifically for commercial transport use is discussed to show its rela- tionship to military and private technology developments. 700269. Propulsion System Impact on Military/ Commer- cial STOL Transport Commonality. J. P. Stalder, North American Rockwell Corp. A STOL medium tactical transport featuring 1000 ft takeoff distance performance has been established uti- lizing the powered-lift wing to achieve STOL capability. Two powered-lift wing concepts, the augmented jet flap and the externally blown flap, are presented as optimum for a minimum thrust-to-weight ratio configuration. Interconnecting the propulsion system with engine cross ducting minimizes the unsymmetrical lift resulting from an engine failure. A commercial counterpart to the military transport is discussed. 700270. Turbine Engine Technology and Cost. George H. Seely and Marvin A. Stibich, Air Force Aero Propulsion Lab. An analysis was conducted on a total of 106,000 turbojet and turbofan engines procured by the United States Air Force to ascertain if an aircraft turbine engine's cost can be effectively correlated to its technical performance. Results indicate that such technical parameters are not valid and other factors such as military situation, economic conditions, and procurement situation should be investigated. 700271. Cost Estimating Techniques for Advanced Tech- nology Engines. T. J. Brennan and R. N. Taylor, Naval Air Development Center.; and A. G. Steinert, Naval Air Systems Command. Throughout the turbojet and turbofan engine devel- opment years of the 1950's and 1960's, performance demands on the engine manufacturer necessitated ever- increasing technology advancement to satisfy these de- mands. In pursuit of the advancing technology, lighter, stronger and more exotic materials were developed but not without substantial increases in the unit engine cost. This paper analyzes the impact of the material and performance technologies over the past two decades. By applying the rationale that the type and amount of raw material inputed for manufacture of an engine, contribute at least in significant part, to its cost, correlations between engine cost and a factor defining a weighted material content were discovered. Investigations of other physical, thermodynamic and metallurgical engine characteristics are discussed to provide a costing method to predict future production engine costs. 700272. Consideration of Performance and Cost in Future Military Aircraft Engines. R. B. Dyson and R. F. O'Donnell, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. Development of methods for reducing engine costs may offer better opportunities for improving the cost effec- tiveness of future military aircraft than do projected engine performance improvements. A technique for evaluating the worth of both cost and performance parameters is described and a review given of methods currently used for development effort may offer consid- erable potential for cost reduction are identified.</page><page sequence="38">700273-700280 700273. The RC Engine - A New Approach to Reduce Costs. W. T. Figart, R. L. Leisenring and W. B. Silvestri, Curtiss- Wright Corp. The military's demand for greater mobility, accurate surveillance systems, heavy and precise firepower, and rapid response capability is refelcted in both the quantity and characteristics of its tactical and combat material requirements. To satisfy this demand, it has been necessary to improve system and power plant perform- ance and maintain logistic requirements without incurring excessive life cycle costs. Because of the inherent simplicity of its design, the rotating combustion engine automatically becomes a power plant of very few parts with a high degree of commonality between models utilizing low cost non- critical materials. The effect of these unique character- istics on life cycle costs for a variety of military application will be discussed in this paper. 700276. 747 Fuel System. E. D. Ayson, R. R. Dhanani and G. A. Parker, The Boeing Co. The fuel system installed in the Boeing Model 747 airplane is described in general, and the pressure fueling system treated in detail. The general treatment includes description of fuel tanks, engine fuel feed system, fuel jettison system, defueling system, fuel quantity indicating system, and fueling system. The component parts of the pressure fueling system are described, and performance of the system is evaluated. In the design of the 747 airplane, surge pressures and static electrification, possible problem areas associated with refueling large airplanes, have been minimized. The fuel system of the 747 meets applicable Federal Aviation Regulations and customer requirements. 700277. Performance of Static Charge Reducer. W. L. Bulkley and I. Ginsburgh, American Oil Co. The static charge reducer, a device to reduce static charges in distillate fuels to safety levels during loading or fueling operations, has been in commercial service for over five years and is now being used in several hundred instal- lations. The field experience and laboratory tests accu- mulated over this time have now been analyzed to show how operation is affected by such variables as the dimensions of the reducer, the flow rate and electrical characteristics of the fuel, and the configuration of the tankage. To date, the principal applications involve the use of 4 or 6 in. diameter reducers for the loading of distillate fuels into commercial tank trucks at flow rates of 400-800 gpm. However, available data for reducers up to 12 in. in diameter, for flow rates up to 2000 gpm, and for various tank sizes are sufficient to indicate how the reducer will perform under a wide variety of conditions. 700278. Experience with Static Dissipator Additive in Aviation Fuels. R. G. Davies, Shell International Petroleum Co. Ltd.; and R. W. Knipple, Shell Oil Co. This is a review paper summarizing much that has appeared elsewhere on the nature of electrostatic fuel charging hazard, but more particularly describing the background to the flight evaluation of and subsequent service experience with aviation fuels containing static dissipator additive ASA-3. Although first introduced into aviation turbine fuel on a test basis by the Royal Canadian Air Force eight years ago, static dissipator additive has been increasingly used, particularly since its mandatory requirement in the British D. Eng. R.D. 2494 specification in the fall of 1968. With a number of major international airlines calling for fuel supplies to contain the approved additive as an additional safety measure, some 8000 million gal of such fuel have now been supplied by various fuel suppliers at over 150 airfields outside the United States. The paper discusses various aspects of this experience, particularly those concerned with the distri- bution and handling of fuels containing static dissipator additive ASA-3. 700279. Relationship Between WSIM Ratings and Fil- ter/Separator Performance. L. Gardner, Na- tional Research Council of Canada. The Water Separation Index, Modified, has been accepted as the standard procedure for assessing the water separating characteristics of a fuel. The significance of this test in relation to filter/separator performance and life, however, has not been well established. An evaluation of the WSIM test has been made in an attempt to establish this significance. This evaluation has shown that the test is sensitive to the presence of surface active materials in a fuel. The response to such materials is reasonably quantitative, although all materials do not respond in the same manner. Filtration tests confirm the sensitivity and indicate that a WSIM rating of less than 100, possibly as low as 75, can be considered acceptable. 1970 SA E Transactions 700280. Increasing Runway Capacity. Paul T. Astholz, Federal Aviation Administration. The control system, operational procedures, aircraft guidance, and basic runway design factors necessary to greatly reduce the lateral separation of independent operating parallel runways, and the longitudinal sepa- ration between approaching aircraft are discussed. In- cluded are the basic performance characteristics required for the approach and landing systems. To obtain the necessary increase in runway utilization rates, a higher degree of automation will be required in the air traffic control system, and in the airborne flight control system. In addition, a new approach and landing system, which can provide curved approaches is proposed. The resulting capacities for various levels of automation, reduced separations, and runway configurations are listed. 1970 SA E Transactions 113</page><page sequence="39">700281-700286 114 700281. Terminal Airspace Utilization. Charles E. Dowling, Jr., Department of Transportation, FAA. This paper discusses several of the most important operational aspects of terminal airspace utilization from an air traffic control viewpoint. Considerations include the work accomplished by the Department of Trans- portation's Air Traffic Control Advisory Committee, their FAA staff, and industry representatives, as well as other selected efforts in analytical and dynamic simulation. Each of the subsystems which are involved in and therefore affect Terminal/Transition airspace use and capacity such as the airport approach and landing, navigation, data acquisition, communications, and air traffic control are discussed in terms of their relationship and interaction with capacity. The anticipated effect of increased automation in both the terminal and en route ATC systems and their interface is described. Possible tradeoffs between safety and expeditiousness are briefly examined. It is concluded that the expected increase in traffic will require major increase in system capability as well as changes in technique and philosophy only possible through extensive automation. In addition, new and improved National Airspace System elements will be required to cope with the resultant demand for capacity and safety. 700282. Terminal Area Automation. John C. Mercer, Federal Aviation Administration. Aviation has historically suffered from underestimating its rate of growth. Couple this with the high speed and short response time of this dynamic business, and we have today's airport and airway dilemma. Analysis indicates that the greatest benefits in system capacity will come from airport improvements and construction. A parallel and companion requirement is airways modernization. Automation and procedural changes are forecast to not only improve operations and capacity at reasonable cost, but can be implemented to offset and hold the line until the expensive and long term airport improvements can be completed. This paper discusses the basic computational-beacon tracking level under contract to be implemented at 64 terminal facilities beginning in 1970, and the important add-on packages under development to increase system reliability and capacity. 700283. Area Navigation - The Twenty-year-old Infant with Great Expectations. S. B. Poritzky, Air Transport Association of America. Area navigation is not new but its full potential has not yet been realized nor attained. This paper traces the history of area navigation, analyzes why it has failed to move ahead, and recommends steps that can lead to its acceptance and adoption by the airline industry. The advantages and disadvantages of various area navigation systems are discussed from the point of view of flight controllers, the FAA, airline operators, pilots, and manufacturers. Problems of cost, hardware design, and system implementation are reviewed. 700284. The Future Markets and Implications of Crane Helicopters. E. E. "Tug" Gustafson, Sikorsky Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. A new era of vertical lift technology was introduced with the development of the Skycrane. The first crane, designated S-60, was designed to carry 6 tons of cargo, was powered by two reciprocating engines, and evolved from the military S-56. It promised unlimited versatility in transporting suspended loads for industrial, commercial, and military operations. With the experience and design information provided by the S-60, a larger version was developed. The twin turbine S-64 Skycrane has a lift capability of 10 tons. The U.S. Army recognized the potential of such an aircraft for use in combat areas to transport heavy equipment and personnel pods nested under the fuselage, and to retrieve many types of aircraft which were downed in areas inaccessible to surface transportation. The S-64 Skycrane has also shown its ability to improve industrial and commercial mobility in trans- porting equipment and supplies to areas of limited accessibility, providing significant savings in time and cost. Substantial markets exist for crane helicopters in four categories of industry: petroleum, shipping, construction, and electric power transmission. The future of the crane helicopter, up to the 50 ton class, looks very bright. Advanced concepts brought about by crane helicopters create new approaches to old transportation problems. 700285. The Corporate/Executive Market for Helicop- ters. Dwayne K. Jose, Bell Helicopter Co. This paper will discuss a brief history of corporate aviation, identify the primary advantages of aviation to the business community, will identify several current trends having a profound effect upon business trans- portation, and will discuss the impact of aviation upon corporate transportation, including the influence at the jet age. It will identify the problems and constraints con- fronting fixed-wing corporate air transportation and will identify which of these problems are amenable to solution by rotocraft, and review the growth of the corporate/ex- ecutive market in use of aircraft and rotorcraft. General characteristics of some of the most commonly used business helicopters are reviewed, including those ex- pected to be in use in the period 1970-1975. 700286. Noise Implications for VTOL Development. W. Z. Stępniewski and F. H. Schmitz, The Boeing Co. Noise from the aircraft may prevent the establishment of VTOL ports near population centers - the locations which can provide a significant contribution to mass transpor-</page><page sequence="40">700287-700293 tation. To determine how annoying these aircraft may be, a Total Community Annoyance Measure (TCAM) has been developed. The TCAM can indicate flight trajec- tories which minimize the annoyance of the aircraft and the type of aircraft which are acoustically acceptable for operations from a V/STOL port. Low disc loading rotors seem best for operation near terminals while low tip speed propellers are best for cruise. 1970 SA E Transactions 700287. Must the Passenger Go to the Airport? Carlos C. Wood, Sikorsky Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. Vehicle technology, particularly in the VTOL field, has advanced to the point where reliable solutions to the short haul problem are now possible. These require bold new measures if the air transport industry is to provide better, faster, more economically feasible service to millions of passengers between now and 1975. Various studies are discussed and suggestions offered for meeting this vitally important challenge. 700288. JT9D Engine Operating Experience. H. Alden Jackson and Horst O. Pohlmann, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. The Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft JT9D engine has recently entered commercial service after an intensive program of development and flight testing. The engine design rep- resents a significant advance over current day engines in terms of achieving increased performance with reduced mechanical complexity, excellent thrust to weight ratio, improved maintenance capability through modular con- struction and outstanding capability for condition moni- toring. This improvement has in the main resulted from the selection of an arrangement where each of two rotors is simply supported by two main bearings rather than the six or more in use in current engines. Experience to date has confirmed that the JT9D engine design has out- standing qualifications for successful commercial oper- ation. Those difficulties encountered to date have been quickly resolved by means of fixes which were available as a result of the continuing JT9D improvement program. The operating record of the engine has been accordingly good, and there is every reason to believe that its rugged design will provide the basis for a highly successful career. 700289. Influence of Airline Experience on CF6 Engine Design. R. W. Hevener, General Electric Co. Experience in the manufacturing, servicing and support of General Electric's current engines in commercial airline service and the high degree of contact and close working relations with airline engineering and maintenance per- sonnel during the design and development phase of the CF6 engine (power plant for the McDonnell Douglas DC- 10) have had a significant impact on the design and installation configuration of the engine. This has resulted in the incorporation of many features to improve main- tainability, parts repair and reliability, and operational performance such as line maintenance and dispatch reliability. 700290. Testing Results of Comprehensive Program for High Bypass Aircraft Engines. R. B. Ingraham, General Electric Co. A comprehensive program of factory, flight, and oper- ational suitability testing has accompanied the devel- opment of the TF39-CF6 family of 40,000 lb thrust class, high bypass ratio turbofan engines. Test results of performance, mechanical durability, and handling char- acteristics under environmental and operational extremes indicate that the good experience of the TF39 in the Lockheed-Georgia/US AF Military Airlift Command's C-5 transport will carry on in the CF6 when it is delivered to airlines late in 1971 in the McDonnell-Douglas DC- 10. 700291. Olympus 593 - Concorde Development Report. M. H. Beanland, Rolls-Royce Ltd. This paper reports the development status of the Olympus 593 engine, especially designed to satisfy the highly demanding performance qualifications of the Concorde aircraft. Design and development programs are discussed in detail and the particular objectives, present and future, are examined from the viewpoints of reliability, main- tainability, and operational capability. Especially inter- esting are the efforts and ingenious ways applied to expedite development by safely continuing test runs of bench machines known to have mechanical defects. 1970 SA E Transactions 700292. Development of the Rolls-Royce RB.211 Turbofan Air Airline Operation. J. M. S. Keen, Rolls-Royce Ltd. This paper briefly reviews the basic design concepts of the RB.2 11-22 high by-pass turbofan engine. It summarizes the facilities available for developing the engine. It concludes with a status report of the engine development program, including comments on the fan blade, combus- tion development and smoke levels, the high pressure turbine blade, oil sealing, structural rig testing, the three-shaft configuration, modular build, borescope in- spection, achieved performance and noise levels. 700293. A Government Total ATC System Concept. Lawrence A. Goldmuntz, U.S. Department of Transportation. This paper reports the recommendations of the Air Traffic Control Advisory Committee for improving air traffic control into the 1990s. The recommended program has three objectives: increase airport capacity to satisfy the demand in the 1975-1980 period and beyond, and provide en route and terminal airspace capacity adequate for the traffic of the 1980s, and determine the ingredients of a fourth generation air traffic control system for the post 1990 period. Details of the steps necessary to achieve these objectives are supplied, along with cost and duration estimates. 115</page><page sequence="41">700296-700302 116 700296. General Aviation Requirements for the 1970's. Victor J. Kayne, Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. General aviation requirements for the national aviation systems of the 1970's include the use of airspace and airports under all conditions by the various kinds of users, not just those aircraft operating within the IFR system. Unconstrained demand in the airspace and at airports must be met without undue economic or regulatory burden. A nationwide system of general aviation airports is required, with satellite airports in major metropolitan areas and general aviation runways on major airports. Instrument approach capability is needed down to reasonable minimums through specific aids and/or area navigation. A modernized flight service program is required including improved weather reporting, fore- casting, dissemination, and communications for general aviation. Safety corridors are needed to segregate high performance traffic in terminal areas. Development is needed in the field of collision prevention to enhance conspicuity, improve cockpit visibility, and develop a low cost proximity warning device. 700299. Cost Effective Avionics Technology for the 1970's. Robert M. Richardson and Lee C. Keene, ITT Navigator Systems, Inc. What is cost effectiveness? How will it affect the airlines and industry? On an overall basis, it will mean nothing more than good economic common sense; cost effec- tiveness will be synonomous with success. There are three specific categories to explore with regard to cost effec- tiveness; namely, technology, systems engineering, and specifications. Cost effectiveness to the airlines can be interpreted as absolute minimal downtime, whereas, its effectiveness as applied to avionics manufacturers will mean cost reduction while maintaining a high degree of accuracy and reliability. This system will be advantageous to those producers who learn the lessons of cost effectiveness, as they will multiply and prosper. 700300. Equipment Applications to 1970's ATC Propos- als. Glen A. Gilbert, Butler National Corp. Evolutionary development of the Air Traffic Control System to meet expanding air traffic volume during the 1970s requires more delegation of ATC functions into the cockpit by providing the pilot with appropriate airborne equipment. Such delegation must, however, be within the framework of ground management of traffic flow and surveillance. Proper development of distributed air traffic control as between the pilot and the controller will result in unloading the system and provide greater efficiency in the overall utilization of airspace and airports, increased safety with respect to avoidance of mid-air collisions and expanded air transportation capacity. Significant equip- ment applications to meet these objectives involve area navigation in four dimensions, automatic transmission of position information derived from the airborne area navigation equipment, proximity measurement (station- keeping) and automatic transmission of ATC instructions. These equipment developments are within the current state of the art, they are economically feasible and significant implementation could be accomplished realistically during the early 1970s. 700301. Solid State Multiplexed Electrical Power Dis- tribution System. H. L. Ernst, The Boeing Co. This paper presents an Advanced Electric Distribution System (AEDS) for future generations of military and commercial airplanes. Based on development activities over the past two years, and complemented by various suppliers, Air Force and Navy development programs, it has become evident that a "Solid State Multiplexed Electrical Power Distribution System" is the direction that should be pursued. This presentation emphasizes the system application, rather than the specific system or equipment design. It is considered that significant benefits will accrue to future airplane development programs by use of AEDS and associated application of Remote Power Controllers (RPCs) provided that they are incorporated early in the development and applied within their "application limits" as compared to being used as a "direct replacement" for the existing conventional distribution system with asso- ciated thermal circuit breakers. These benefits will include such items as wire weight reduction, crew work load reduction, reduced panel space requirements in the flight deck, and automatic load management functions. 1970 SA E Transactions 700302. Basic Principles of Digital Interior Communi- cation Systems. M. S. Osborn and D. C. Fox, Autonetics Div., North American Rockwell Corp. The increase in the amount of complex communication equipment in aircraft systems has caused problems which conventional approaches to interconnection of inde- pendent subsystems can no longer solve. Using point- to-point wiring penalizes aircraft performance in terms of space usage, weight, cost, and reliability. This paper presents multiplexing techniques in con- junction with solid state technology and systems inte- gration as proposed methods which will provide a cost effective solution to aircraft interior communication problems. Two basic systems reviewed are time division and frequency division multiplexing. The proposed use of a digital interior communication system for the SST, and the criteria that no single failure in a common element would cause loss of a signal, led to development of four multiplex systems which are dual redundant. Other features of this system are weight/cost advantages, flexibility, maintainability, and redundancy which insures high operational reliability and flight safety. In conclusion, it is felt the state-of-the-art is capable of implementing the digital communication system and these</page><page sequence="42">700303-700312 techniques will significantly improve the operation of current and future aircraft. 700303. Aircraft Electrical System Multiplexing. Olin B. King and V. B. Ramsey, SCI Electronics, Inc. The application of multiplexing to civilian and military aircraft electrical systems provides substantial improve- ments in cost, weight reduction, flexibility, reliability and maintainability over conventional hard-wired systems. Relay logic and dedicated wires throughout a typical aircraft are replaced with remote data terminals, a twisted-shielded pair data bus, and a programmable central control unit. System reliability and maintainability is enhanced by the use of dual redundancy, built-in-test and automatic fault isolation and redundant switchover features. The system operation is stable when subjected to electro- magnetic interference and electrical system transients. Current developments include a Data Handling System for SOSTEL II, device technology in solid state power controllers, and remotely resettable circuit breakers. A review of future aircraft electrical systems indicates that integrating the multiplex data terminals with other elements of the electrical systems will provide even further reductions in aircraft wiring. 700304. Solid-State Power Controllers for Aircraft Elec- trical Power Systems. R. D. Gold and F. S. Kamp, RCA/Electronic Components. Solid-state power controllers can be designed to meet the stringent performance and reliability requirements for aircraft electrical systems. Every stage in the design required complete understanding of the science and the art of the technical disciplines involved. Moreover, an integrated systems approach is necessary to take full advantage of each technology. The complete safe-area characteristic of the power transistor is most important in design of dc controllers. High surge capability, as well as high di/dt and dv/dt capability, is important in design of ac controllers. Finally, the power-handling capability of the hybrid module package must be considered. 700305. Solid State Proximity Switches/Logic for Air- craft Electrical System Applications. T. E. Gidlund, Electro Development Corp. The development of solid state proximity switches, sensors, logic and self-test circuits for aircraft electrical applications has led to switching systems for actuators, thrust reversers, and integrated sensor/switch units with improved reliability, maintainability and simplicity of application. The advantages of proximity switches over mechanical switches, design objectives, operational de- tails, and features of the system are discussed. 700306. Solid State Power Controller Circuits and Their Effect Upon Power Conditioning Requirements. Clyde M. Jones and Homer W. Heinzman, LTV Aerospace Corp. This paper examines the effect of solid state switching upon aerospace electric power conditioning equipment. During the past 10 years, aerospace solid state switching concepts have undergone laboratory and flight test evaluations to establish the feasibility of the systems approach. This extension of the program to include power conditioning studies reveals several parameters affecting the design of power conditioning equipment and describes several new systems capabilities. 1970 SA E Transactions 700308. Solid State Power Controllers. K. R. Jackson and W. B. Weaver, Relay Div., Leach Corp. Semiconductor control assemblies for use in switching aircraft electrical power are described. These new solid state devices combine the functions of circuit breakers, relays and current limitors. They may be remotely located from the control points and will function on logic level signals. Some types include feedback to limit current on major faults reducing the stress on the entire power system. They offer the inherent long life and high reliability of solid-state components together with greater flexibility of power system design. 1970 SA E Transactions 700310. VTOL Profitability in the Northeast Corridor. M. W. Hellyar, Jr., Sikorsky Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. America can no longer tolerate increased congestion in its air travel system. Viable improvements must be under- taken without further delay. VTOL's, such as the S-65-200 compound aircraft, offer numerous advantages. They have minimal requirements for real estate, are compatible with the city-center ports needed for an effective short haul system, and are economically attractive, based on conservative calculations of costs and revenues, as the facts and figures in this paper show. 700311. Expected Technical and Economic Characteris- tics of 1975 STOL Systems. Marvin D. Marks, R. K. Schaefer, Jr. and J. P. Caldwell, McDonnell Douglas Corp. The expected technical and economic characteristics of 1975 STOL systems are discussed in terms of the requirements of the passenger market, the aircraft, ground terminal facilities, and separate STOL ATC capability. An evolutionary approach is recommended utilizing existing, proven technology to establish a first generation operation system to develop the STOL concept and provide the data base for planning second generation vehicle development. A timetable for evolutionary development is presented with significant development milestones identified. 700312. Airline Technical Requirements for 1975 STOL and V/STOL Systems. T. Oakes, Eastern Air Lines, Inc. V/STOL vehicles, equipped with area navigation systems 117</page><page sequence="43">700313-700319 118 and supported by appropriate ground facilities, show great promise in relieving many of the United States' air traffic congestion problems. These vehicles have the capability to provide rapid short-haul transportation while operating from short runways constructed at conveniently located V/STOL ports close to downtown city-center locations. In addition, an essential part of, and adjunct to this transportation concept, is the operation of a V/STOL feeder service on a noninterference basis into existing major terminals. This would relieve a large percentage of both air and ground traffic congestion at major air terminals and would free the existing facilities to serve primarily as long-haul air transportation centers. 700313. Airline Economic Requirements for 1975 STOL and VTOL Systems. Robin K. Ransone, Amer- ican Airlines, Inc. The economic factors are discussed, which affect the need for metrof light service in the Northeast Corridor, the problems of developing the system, and a practical solution. The basic problem is the enormous cost and the lack of confidence felt by those who must build the landing facilities and buy the aircraft. The proposed solution is an evolutionary development process, starting with a short term metroflight demonstration, using existing 40-60 passenger propeller-driven STOL aircraft operating from simple, interim city-center STOL ports between Man- hattan, and Washington, D.C. or Boston. Such an evolutionary development is essential if a mature metro- flight system is to be realized without large federal subsidies. 700314. Some Historical Highlights of Turbine Engine Condition Monitoring Using Flight Data. P. D. Doran, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. This paper outlines highlights of developments in the techniques of turbine engine performance monitoring using flight data. The steadily increasing importance of economic considerations in commerical air transport is expected to bring about extended usage of such engine performance monitoring practices as the current equip- ment builds up time. The introduction into service of more complex and costly new aircraft is expected to dictate requirements for future continuing development of in- creasingly sophisticated techniques using flight data to monitor the performance of the advanced engines and associated systems installed in such aircraft. It is, therefore, intended that this paper will help those who seek a general perspective on how flight data performance monitoring of turbine engines began, what major steps took place in its development, the extent to which it is in use today, and its prospects for the future. 700316. Maintenance Trends for New Air Transport Powerplants. H. N. Taylor, United Air Lines, Inc. Powerplant maintenance practices are undergoing major changes from the early days of time-controlled overhauls of the complete jet engine. Through utilization of a program of investigation of premature removals of engines, trouble spots were pin-pointed, modifications developed, and the practice of sample overhauls of engines was completely eliminated. Another proposal being developed is the concept of "threshold" sampling whereby an initial sampling age is specified rather than progressive ages at which samples must be taken. With the next generation of aircraft, new practices in maintenance must be undertaken such as pooling of engines and components for maintenance purposes be- tween operators, decentralization of the maintenance function, accessibility for inspection of the engine as well as condition-monitoring of engine components. In conclusion, a close liaison must be maintained between manufacturer and the airlines on the engineering level so that the designer is kept aware of production design criteria under actual operating conditions. 700317. American Airlines9 Maintenance Recorder Ex- perience. S. Pauliny, American Airlines, Inc. Fifteen American Airlines' BAC 1-11 airplanes have been equipped with electronic engine maintenance recorders, for the purpose of evaluating the feasibility and merits of automatic maintenance recording on air transport aircraft. The maintenance recorder system and method of data reduction are briefly described. The experience gained to date from this program is portrayed. Some economic projections in the B747 and DC- 10 jumbo jets are made, based on this experience. 700318. Bearings and Dampers for Advanced Jet Engines. Paul F. Brown, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, Div., United Aircraft Corp. Sophisticated mainshaft support systems must be de- veloped because present jet engines demand long life and the next generation of engines will require higher levels of performance and higher thrust to weight ratios. Conse- quently, the bearings in these support systems must operate at higher speeds and for longer periods of time than ever before. To achieve this performance three of the factors considered in the design are surface finish and waviness control duplexing versus single ball thrust bearings, and lubrication and cooling systems. In addi- tion, oil film dampers mounted integral with or immedi- ately surrounding the outer race of these bearings provide significant reductions in vibration amplitudes transmitted to the engine supporting structure and in static structure stresses, and can prolong life or provide the option of reducing structural weight without increasing stress. 1970 SA E Transactions 700319. Lighweight Fabrications for Modern Technology Engines. E. Frank Sheldon, Rolls-Royce Ltd. Minimum weight has always been a fundamental re-</page><page sequence="44">700320-700329 quirement in aerojet engine design, but the weight of fabricated components has not received equal consid- eration. This paper suggests methods by which simplicity of design and fabrication by welding and brazing techniques, rather than the many nut-and-bolt joints, can provide additional weight saving and cost in engine components. 700320. The Effects of Nonlinear Asymmetric Supports on Turbine Engine Rotor Stability. Rozell Williams, Jr. and Ronald Trent, Allison Div., General Motors Corp. A rotor-shaft system supported at one end by a spline coupling, and at the other end by a flexible bearing support having asymmetric and non-linear characteristics is analyzed. The effects of nonlinearity and asymmetry in the flexible support, on the response to excitation from sliding friction in the spline coupling and rotor unbalance are investigated. The spline friction is represented as coulomb friction. As a result of the sliding friction excitation, a bounded nonsynchronous whirl is shown to occur at rotational speeds above the undamped natural frequency of the system. 1970 SA E Transactions 700322. V/STOL Guidance Systems for Approach and Landing. M. A. Meyer, Epsco, Inc. While operational procedures for V/STOL aircraft have yet to be developed, it can be seen that the ground guidance system for landing must have greater flexibility and capability than previous systems. A greater diversity of flight paths in both planes than is presently available is required. In addition, airport size and location dictates equipment which is small and site insensitive. These requirements are met by a microwave instrument landing system. Since microwave radio landing systems are predom- inantly line-of-sight enroute navigation guidance using radio means must consider the utilization of other existing systems such as Loran or Omega. A description of recently available equipment for STOL landings is given. 700325. STOL Aircraft Noise Certification - A Rational Approach. Frederick B. Metzger, Hamilton Standard Div., United Aircraft Corp.; and William M. Foley, United Aircraft Corp. Re- search Labs. Government and industry representatives are currently at work formulating a rule for certifying the noise levels of short takoff and landing (STOL) aircraft. Conventional aircraft are primarily turbofan propelled and fly over well-defined landing or takeoff paths both at conventional airports. In contrast to this, STOL aircraft may be propelled by propellers or rotors as well as turbofans, and will fly over varied landing and takeoff paths at new STOL ports located in or around populated areas. Therefore, it is expected that the STOL noise rule will differ from that issued late in 1969 for conventional subsonic transport aircraft. In this paper the background information on STOL aircraft noise, STOL port sight characteristics and noise evaluation units is discussed. Based on this information, the characteristics of a STOL noise rule are discussed that recognize the variety of aircraft types, the complexity of landing and takeoff paths, and the uniqueness of STOL ports which will make up the intercity air transportation system of the future. 1970 SA E Transactions 700326. Reliability and Maintainability from an Airline Standpoint. K. D. Roberson, American Airlines, Inc.; R. J. Thatcher, Air Canada.; R. E. McCallman, National Airlines.; R. W. Dobbins, Pan American.; B. M. Meador, Trans World Airlines.; and F. S. Nowland, United Air Lines. An Air Transport Association Reliability and Main- tainability Subcommittee has been formed to develop and nurture R &amp; M concepts within the airline industry. The subcommittee summarizes its views concerning the rela- tionship of the designer to R &amp; M. Some basic infor- mation is provided covering the airline operating envi- ronment. Specifically, the importance of the need for a better balance between R &amp; M and other design parameters is emphasized. Data is provided on the cost impact of poor reliability and maintainability. 700328. Application of Tradeoff Decision Processes to the Establishment of Scheduled Maintenance Fre- quencies for Commercial Transport Aircraft. K. W. Dukes and R. W. MacGregor, Douglas Aircraft Co. Scheduled maintenance frequencies and time limits for commercial transport aircraft are generally quantitative. Their numerical values are seldom, if ever, derived by calculation, however. At best, they are quantified ex- pressions of good subjective judgment. This paper submits the premise that if a scheduled maintenance frequency or time limit is worth quantifying, it should also be possible to rationally calculate the approximate numerical value of that frequency or limit. The significance and availability of measurable variables required to implement such a calculation are examined. A tradeoff equation is developed and submitted as a feasible response to the need for a more rational and less emotional approach to the establishment of scheduled maintenance frequencies. 700329. A Cooperative Airline Program to Evaluate Engine Parts Aging Effects on a Current Turbofan Engine Model. B. R. Arnold, American Airlines, Inc.; and J. R. Gast, Trans World Airlines, Inc. The contribution that aged hardware makes to per- formance deterioration is of interest to operators of JT3D turbofan powered aircraft since a significant percentage of these engines have exceeded 20,000 hr of operation. 119</page><page sequence="45">700330-700338 120 Recent studies involving numerous engine dis- assemblies, rebuild, and test cell runs reveal the most significant effects of aged hardware are the loss in high and/or low compressor stall margin; and that a large number of parts must be replaced to realize a significant improvement in fuel consumption, with the exception of the reduction that can be obtained by controlling turbine seal clearances. 1970 SA E Transactions 700330. Compressor Clearance Control Coatings. P. E. Hamilton, Allison Div., General Motors Corp. The efficiency of axial flow compressors is greatly affected by the amount of air that leaks past the blade tips. It is desirable, therefore, to reduce the clearance between the compressor case and the rotating compressor blades as much as possible. One solution to the problem is to utilize a clearance coating in the compressor case at the blade tip paths. Two methods for accomplishing this on both new and overhaul cases is discussed in detail. 700332. Repair of Diffusion Coatings. A. Bruce Richter, U. S. Air Force. Repair of diffusion coatings applied to jet engine gas path parts is accomplished when the coatings show wear from foreign object damage, erosion, corrosion, and ox- idation/sulfidation attack. Inspection of diffusion coat- ings is currently limited to conventional visual methods which are insufficient for determining the integrity of the coating and its accompanying diffusion zone. Successfully used diffusion coatings have been tailored to the parent materials' heat treatment requirements so that the coated alloy has maximum resistance to corrosion, erosion, and oxidation/sulfidation with minimum effects on the fatigue and stress-rupture properties of the parent material. 700333. The Case for V/STOL Aircraft in Short-Haul Transportation. D. G. Brown, Hawker Siddeley Aviation. The case for a VTOL transport system is presented primarily against the background of European require- ments, based on the use of fast low noise Fan Lift V/STOL aircraft. The main benefits are: 1. Passenger and airline appeal - time saving, con- venience, competitive fares. 2. Community acceptance - reduced noise, reduced proliferation of large airports. 3. Operational advantages - flexibility, enhanced all weather operation, safety and ATC. 4. Reduced investment - on a total system basis. The Fan Lift formula leads to a wide range of V/STOL aircraft to meet worldwide STOL, V/STOL and VTOL requirements, with excellent long term devel- opment prospects. 1970 SA E Transactions 700336. American Airlines - McDonnell Douglas Inter- Metropolitan STOL Evaluation. Robin K. Ransone, American Airlines, Inc. American Airlines, Inc. and McDonnell Douglas Cor- poration conducted a 75 hr STOL evaluation in the Spring of 1969. The MDC Model 188 (Br. 94 IS) test aircraft was equipped with Butler-National, Decca, and Litton 3-D RNAV systems and a Singer-General Precision, Inc. microwave landing guidance system. Data were obtained on the aircraft and STOL/RNAV operational procedures. About 9800 frames of onboard position indications were recorded and correlated with precision ground-based tracking radar measurements to quantitatively determine the RNAV and TALAR systems' accuracy and re- peatability. Results indicate STOL with RNAV is technically feasible and has operational advantages. Conceptually, all of the equipment tested was satisfactory, but neither the test aircraft nor the RNAV systems were satisfactory for airline use in their present form. 700337. A Systems Approach to Air Transportation. Robert W. Simpson, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. An attempt is made to describe a systems approach to planning the development of national transportation systems. A transportation systems development process is defined as made up of activities such as policy making, planning, and systems analysis and actions comprising decisions and implementation programs. It is concluded that the present process of transportation development is far from rational or systematic and that major changes are required. 700338. CRC Evaluation of Aviation Emission - Meas- urement Techniques. T. O. Wagner, American Oil Co. Methods for sampling, handling and measuring emissions of particulates, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and oxygenated compounds in the exhaust of aircraft turbine engines were evaluated in a cooperative experimental program conducted by industry and government at the Naval Air Propulsion Test Center in September, 1969. Non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) instruments and a Fisher chromatographic partitioner were both well suited for measuring CO and C02. Some additional development is needed in NDIR instruments and the phenol disulphonic acid (PDS) method for measuring NOx and in the 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazine hyrochloride (MBTH) method for measuring oxygenated compounds. Available flame ionization detector (FID) analyzers performed satisfactorily in measuring hydrocarbons in the range of 200-300 ppm C such as prevailed at idle rpm, but they were not reliable in measuring hydrocarbons in the range of 10 ppm or less such as prevailed at high rpm. In handling samples for hydrocarbon measurements, short, hot Teflon lines with high flow rates appear to be</page><page sequence="46">700339-700345 optimum, but with proper care, satisfactory results can be obtained with long, cold lines. Carbonaceous particulates measured by Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control District (APCD) samples, Leco crucibles and Scientific Advances Cascade Im- pactors agreed fairly well. The significance of water- soluble and solvent-soluble materials collected in the APCD samplers needs further study. Single-point sam- pling of the engine tail-pipe plane must be validated by a traverse before it can be taken to yield representative emissions. 700339. (SP-358) Relationships Between Optimal and Conventional "Good" Systems - A Simple Case Study. Duane McRuer and David Weir, Systems Technology, Inc. Conventional system synthesis involves indirect repetitive analysis, while optimal synthesis techniques yield direct solutions, given prescribed criteria. This paper presents some of the relationships between a conventionally derived optimum system and the corresponding optimal system, using a second order example. Methods for specifying optimal cost functions which result in good systems are explored. 1970 SA E Transactions 700340. (SP-358) Upstage Missile Flight Control System. John L. Pearson, McDonnell Douglas Astro- nautics Corp. In this paper the control of lifting bodies is discussed from the standpoint of a particular lifting body application, namely, the Upstage interceptor. A brief description of the interceptor is given, along with a discussion of the command logic required to capitalize on the advantages of the lifting body in this application. The plant and control mechanism are discussed to illustrate the major sources of cross-axis coupling in the control problem. Finally, the control design approach used, which combines some modern control techniques with classical analysis tools, is discussed, and the philosophy employed in countering the major cross-axis coupling term is outlined. 700341. (SP-358) An Approach to Direct Design of Conventional Closed-Loop Controllers. Lee Gregor Hofmann, Systems Technology, Inc. One means for reconciling the typically different closed- loop controllers produced by conventional and optimal synthesis techniques is shown to be a particular formu- lation of the optimal control problem. This formulation uses the desired open-loop function to form the reference model. From this formulation, controllers similar to the conventional controllers for the three principal, elemen- tary, controlled elements - the gain, integration, and double integration - are derived. Results of these deri- vations are used to infer the general rules of the method for application for any controlled element having a single control point. This paper describes the formulation and derivations necessary to produce the desirable closed-loop properties. 1970 SA E Transactions 700342. (SP-358) Wind Gust O - 300 ft Altitude Homo- geneous Terrain. G. B. Skelton, Honeywell Inc. This paper is concerned with the development of statis- tical models for the gust field in the lowest 300 ft of the atmosphere. It presents some of the highlights of the underlying physics principles, what is known about gusts, and how gusts affect aircraft. The difficulties of devel- oping gust models are accounted for by the lack of data in particular areas and thus direct attention to the work required to provide the needed information. 1970 SA E Transactions 700343. (SP-358) Liquid Metal Serovactuation Packages for Flight Controls. R. C. Kumpitsch and D. C. Sturges, Jr., General Electric Co. A most promising approach in the field of flight control surface actuation is the use of independent integrated hydraulic actuator packages located at each flight surface actuation station. This concept eliminates hydraulic plumbing throughout the vehicle thus reducing the external connections to only electric power and command signals which are easily made redundant. The most compact and universal configuration of these packages will use a liquid metal hydraulic fluid thus making them capable of sustained operation in high- temperature environments without need of collant sys- tems. This paper summarizes the research, development, and experimental work that has been done so far. 1970 SA E Transactions 700344. (SP-358) The Flow Difference Sensor. G. D. Jenney, Hydraulic Research &amp; Manufacturing Co. Loss of aircraft from ground-fire strikes on hydraulic systems and primary flight controls was the incentive for developing the Flow Difference Sensor, a device that cuts out flow in damaged lines and bypass it to effect minimum loss of fluid. This system decreases aircraft vulnerability greatly and reduces fire hazard. This paper describes the design, operation, and flight qualification tests of the instrument. 1970 SA E Transactions 700345. Application of Maintenance Simulation Tech- niques to Commercial Transport Aircraft. T. F. Weber, Jr., Lockheed-California Co. Steadily increasing computer capabilities, accompanied by easily employed programming techniques, are pro- viding maintenance and logistics analysts with powerful tools. Properly employed, these tools can serve a variety of application at reasonable cost and will result in increased airline operations and maintenance effectiveness. This paper describes simulation modeling techniques (Monte Carlo) used to study and quantify reliability and main- 121</page><page sequence="47">700346-700353 122 tainability interrelationships among large commercial transport aircraft. 700346. (SP-357) Diesels from the Woodshed. C. Lyle Cummins, Jr., American Bosch Arma Corp. This paper, written on the occasion of the posthumous presentation of the Horning Memorial Award to Clessie L. Cummins, traces Cummins' contributions to the development of the high-speed diesel engine from 1920 to his death. Cummins' first engine was a single cylinder one which developed 6 hp at 600 rpm. The last, while associated with Cummins Engine Co., was the Model A rated 85 hp at 2200 rpm. The author highlights various steps between these two engines, including race car, automobile, locomotive, and truck applications. The last half of the paper describes in detail Cummins' last engine: one run on natural gas by spark ignition. It is a 4-cycle, 3-cyl, barrel type with a design rating of 125 hp at 3000 rpm. 700347. Seat Belts for Truck Occupant Safety. H. George Johannessen, Hamill Mfg. Co., Div., The Fire- stone Tire and Rubber Co. Seat belts are recommended for truck occupants to prevent injury and death. Small trucks having conven- tional seating may use seat belt systems already available for passenger cars. Large trucks with suspension seats may use duplex systems having a seat belt to secure the driver to the seat and an additional belt to secure the seat to the cab structure. All trucks may use available seat belt systems designed for greater convenience and comfort. The use of installed seat belts in passenger cars and trucks is unacceptably low. Increased usage is being encouraged through educational and motivational pro- grams by many interested persons and groups. Mandatory use of installed seat belts by drivers of over-the-road trucks is proposed. Current developmental effort of seat belt manufacturers are directed toward providing greater convenience and comfort when seat belts are in use, and simpler, cleaner stowage of the seat belts when not in use. 700349. The American Motors 1970 Rebel Machine. R. A. Petersen, American Motors Corp. The American Motors new concept in muscle cars is achieved in the production of the Î970 Rebel "Machine." This car's appearance is dramatized by the interior and exterior styling efforts, which imparts a distinctive and easily recognizable identity. In standard-production form, it contains powerplant components to assure outstanding performance characteristics, while retaining the features required for normal street operations. This "Machine" will use our production 390 cu in. version with modifications, that will provide optimum performance without incurring high-unit cost penalties. 700350. (P-30) Safety Program Management. Louis C. Lundstrom, Auto. Safety Engrg., General Mo- tors Corp. Highway safety management in the United States is divided into three periods of historical development: an early period, extending from the turn of the century to about 1935; a middle period, from 1935 to 1965; and a current period beginning with the institution of the Highway Safety Act of 1966. The first two periods were essentially ones of genesis and growth, periods of trial, of attempting to develop some understanding of an extremely complex new social problem rising, as so often is the case, from a major invention of progress. There were repeated, serious attempts at coordinating efforts directed toward highway safety, but such efforts, dependent for the most part upon voluntary cooperation between voluntary organizations, never quite succeeded in accomplishing the desired goal, yet still managed a considerable measure of success. Too many things were lacking, funds primarily, as well as any prior knowledge of the depths of the safety problem. Even today both continue to be in vital need. Another limiting factor to success of safety man- agement in these first two periods was the division of the implementation of safety programs between the individual states and municipalities. 1970 SA E Transactions 700351. (P-30) Safety Program Management. Hubert Perring, Ministry of Transport, United King- dom. The present system of dealing with vehicle safety is seen to start with the acquisition of statistics, mainly by Gov- ernment Agencies, of the volume of traffic and of the accidents and casualties which result. This information is used by Governments when deciding their allocation of resources of men and money to the different aspects of road transportation and the information is also published for the use of other workers. Various research agencies in each country work on the different facets of the vehicle safety problem that affect the automobile engineer. The results of work carried out in universities etc. is normally published for general use but individual firms in the motor industry will probably publish only a limited amount of their work. Following work by industry upon possible solutions to the different problems posed by the research findings it can provide the information on the practicability, cost and time needed to incorporate the design on the production line that the Government needs when deciding whether to legislate for a new feature to be required in each new vehicle. Legislation demanding the provision of a particular feature means that industry must then proceed to incorporate the necessary modifications in their manu- facturing and assembly processes. 700353.

Berlioz, Organisme National de</page><page sequence="48">700354-700358 Sécurité Routière.; and M. Ternier, Ministère des Finances. The main conclusions of the first phase of a road accident study utilizing the Planning-Programming-Budgeting Sys- tem are presented. This system involved a systematic exploration of the many means of performing precisely defined missions - in this case, related to road safety. Each means was studied by many different experts, working together as a multidisciplinary team. Cost effectiveness analysis was used in evaluating the different programs. The main forms of action proposed cover: education, public information, drunken driving, speed regulation, insurance, vehicle, roads and first aid. 700354. (P-30) The Programming and Implementation of Effective Driver Research and Related Counter- measures in Developing Countries. Allan Katz, Technion R&amp;D Foundation. The core of the driver research and act programming problem for developing countries is: 1. Should traditional programs established in "safety developed" countries be copied and transferred? 2. Are effective alternatives available to existing traditional programs, or can they be developed? 3. What are the requirements for the implementation of driver safety programs? In the first part of this paper factors relative to questions 1 and 2 will be discussed and an approach to what is considered an appropriate policy in the field of driver countermeasure action and research will be sug- gested. This will be followed by a discussion of some of the realities of policy making and the requirements of organization for the ongoing development and imple- mentation of safety research and action programs. The material for this paper is based primarily on the organ- izational history and experience of a new safety research center in a developing country, and on a survey conducted among 19 nations regarding their formal organization for road safety purposes. The paper was originally conceived as being of primary interest to developing countries, but the results of the survey indicated clearly that the issues discussed are relevant for a great number of advanced motorized countries who have only recently begun to think seriously in terms of safety policy and organization. 700355. (P-30) Management of an Automotive Safety Engineering Program. K. A. Stonex, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. Management of an effective automotive safety engi- neering program is recognized in General Motors as being a corporate staff function. This permits early recognition of needs and the orderly development of both short- and long-range goals and coordination of the steps necessary to attain them. Essential to a well-directed program are methods of measurement to permit evaluations of new design con- cepts which require the availability of adequate technical and physical facilities. Methods of measurement of the real-life situations of highway traffic are essential so that the urgency or priority of specific objections can be determined realistically and continuously, and so that the effectiveness of design improvements can be evaluated objectively. 700356. (P-30) Anthropometry. Peter Kyropoulos and Ronald W. Roe, Styling Staff, General Motors Corp. The state of the art of anthropometrics and its bearing on the design of automobiles is summarized. An overview, source material, and a few do's and don'ts are provided for those on the periphery of human engineering, or who are entering the field from other disciplines. In order to meet this educational requirement, references and con- siderations beyond the narrow meaning of the term anthropometry which means measure of man are pro- vided. As part of human engineering, it means more than collecting measurements. It must actively contribute to fitting the machine to the driver and allow him or her to function with efficiency, safety, with minimum discom- fort, and in any environment. It is important to under- stand, in planning and collecting measurement, what is to be done with them afterwards in the design process. 700357. (P-30) Anthropometry and Vehicle Construction - A Brief Survey. E. Fiala, Institute for Motor Vehicles, University of Berlin. The term anthropometry today covers measurement and weight, momentum of inertia and relative mobility (static anthropometry) and also the movement of the body itself (dynamic anthropometry). In addition to its importance in biology and medicine anthropometry is acquiring increas- ing significance in the technical field, and here again in particular for the designing of vehicles of all kinds. Anthropometry borders, firstly, on ergonomics, in which in accordance with the division made here the forces and energy output a human being actively exerts are examined, and secondly, on the problem of impact tolerance, which depend on the tensions and deformations which the tissue can passively withstand. 700358. (P-30) Anthropometric Characteristics of Auto- mobile Drivers. Howard W. Stoudt and Ross A. McFarland, Harvard School of Public Health. A recent survey is described in which a series of anthropometric measurements were taken which are related to automobile design. In the first phase of the research 1000 seated subjects were used to obtain 22 static measurements, most of which were indexed to two different reference points, the SAE H point and the accelerator heel point. In the second phase of the research measurements of functional arm reach to 117 points within the seated workspace were obtained on 100 subjects. Examples of the static and dynamic data obtained are given in both tabular and graphic form. 123</page><page sequence="49">700359-700363 124 Discussions are included of measurements taken, the reasons for their selection, the measuring techniques employed, the statistical analyses used, and the potential applications of the data. 700359. (P-30) Effect of Body Restraints on Driver Reach. John W. Chaffee, Ford Motor Co. Increased use of upper torso restraints directs attention toward the possible effects on driver reach capability in an automotive package. The results of a survey of male and female driver reach envelopes-"ergospheres"-in American and European basic package geometries are presented. Contour sections representing 5th-percentile shells of the ergospheres resulting from various degrees of torso restraint are presented in comparison with the ergosphere characteristic of lap-belt-only restraint. Differences in the effects on reach are pronounced and suggest that the inertia-reel type of upper torso restraint incurs the least reduction in size of the ergosphere. 700360. (P-30) Optimum Utilization of the Vehicle Avail- able Occupant Space to Ensure Passenger Pro- tection. C. Tarriere and R. Rebiffe, Peugeot- Renault Association.; and J. Hamon and G. Mauron, Peugeot S.A. The authors contemplate an improved utilization of the frontal survival space between the front seat passenger and the occupant enclosure. They propose a belt design and a crash seat trans- versally pivoted at the base with rotational shock absorbers to better apportion between the two the deceleration forces on the passenger. 700361. (P-30) Crash Testing of Humans in Automobile Seats. Richard F. Chandler and Robert A. Christian, National Bureau of Standards. The design of the automobile interior is largely based upon design data gathered under static conditions, where the inertial properties of the human body do not enter into consideration. Anthropometric data based on static measurements are valid for design of clearance and access for normal operation of the vehicle, and have been widely collected and used for these purposes. The requirements of the human operator or passenger during a crash are not as well documented. Clearances, paths of travel, velocities along the path and other dynamic data are of vital interest to the designer. Because of the difficulties in obtaining information about humans under crash conditions, most of the available guidelines are based upon dummy or cadaver tests. Until adequate human data are available, the designer must use the information obtained from human simulators and consider it only an unconfirmed approximation. To alleviate this shortage of human impact data the National Bureau of Standards initiated a research pro- gram in cooperation with the 6571st Aeromedicai Re- search Laboratory. Tests were conducted on the Daisy Decelerator at Holloman AFB to gather comparative data about human and dummy test subjects under crash conditions using automotive seating and restraint systems. The data presented in this report include 32 human tests of controlled impacts of approximately the same mag- nitude. Variables are the type of restraint, either lap belt or lap belt plus single diagonal, and subject size. All tests were conducted in the -Gx orientation using a production automobile bucket seat. Data presented include the displacement paths of the subjects during impact, the maximum velocity along the path, anthropometric data loads generated in the restraint system, and medical and subject evaluation of the impacts. 700362. (P-30) Ergonomics and Motor Vehicle Safety. Ross A. McFarland and Roland C. Moore, Harvard School of Public Health. The use of ergonomics in the design of vehicular equipment is presented. It is proposed that the wider use of the principles and methods of this discipline might aid in the more effective integration of the driver and his equipment. It has been shown that the effectiveness of any man-machine system depends upon the integration of the biological characteristics of the operator with the me- chanical design of the equipment and working areas. The initial phase of a program in ergonomics, should always consist of an advance analysis of the equipment, including a survey of the nature of the task, the work surroundings, the location of controls and instruments, and the way the operator performs his duties. In highway safety the application of human engi- neering principles has been shown to be of great importance in the design of windshields, rear view mirrors, and vehicle lighting, and other visual aids to the drivers. The field of crash injury research is proving to be especially important in understanding the parts of the vehicle most likely to give rise to injury. Current research is tending to give more precise measurements not only in regard to the forces involved, but also to the thresholds and patterns of injury. The various research programs in the field of ergonomics as related to highway safety in various parts of the world have greatly increased in recent years. 1970 SA E Transactions 700363. (P-30) Braking and Steering Effort Capabilities of Drivers. Dennis A. Eaton and Henry J. Dittmeier II, Ford Motor Co. Two experiments were conducted to determine a level of control effort that can be exerted or exceeded by a high percentage of drivers. In both studies, female subjects were made to respond to an unexpected drastic increase in control effort while attempting maneuvers in a vehicle. In one investigation, test subjects were required to brake a vehicle in a dead-end pylon corridor, resulting in a 5 th percentile pedal force capability for women of 100 lb. In the other study, test subjects were required to perform a lane change maneuver, resulting in a 5th percentile steering wheel power capability for women of 0.023 hp.</page><page sequence="50">700364-700368 The results of these experiments are consistent with a recently published study of maximum control effort in a static seating package. 700364. (P-30) Driver Braking Performance as a Function of Pedal-Force and Pedal-Displacement Levels. Leonard Segel and Rudolf Mortimer, The Uni- versity of Michigan. Driver- vehicle tests were performed in which the decel- eration/pedal-force ratio (i.e., gain), pedal-displacement level, speed, surface-tire friction, and driver characteristics were systematically varied in order to determine the influence of these variables upon minimum stopping distance and other performance variables. Tests performed on a low coefficient of friction surface showed that high values of deceleration/pedal- force gain result in a greater number of wheel lockups and longer stopping distances compared to results achieved with intermediate or low deceleration/pedal-force gains. Tests performed on the two test surfaces with high and intermediate levels of friction showed that low decel- eration/pedal-force gains produced longer stopping dis- tances than were obtained with high gain, even though a high-gain brake system causes higher frequencies of wheel lockup. There were no significant differences in braking performance attributable to pedal-displacement level except that a zero-displacement pedal resulted in a significantly larger number of wheel lockups. The findings are discussed and evaluated with respect to developing recommendations for standards on pedal- force levels and deceleration/pedal-force gains. The data show that drivers are unable to utilize all of the braking capability existing in the test vehicle when it is necessary to modulate thę pedal force to maintain steering control and path stability. 700365. (P-30) Electrocardiographic Investigations During Car Driving on Road. V. Wyss, Fiat S.p.A. Heart rate, blood pressure and e.c.g. tracings were investigated on 84 subjects (20 average drivers, 12 seniors, 32 test drivers, and 20 women) driving their own cars over six different test routes (fast and slow town driving, fast and slow motorway driving, up- and down-hill driving). While blood pressure and e.c.g. tracings show no signif- icant variations, heart rate increases from 71 ±8 beats/min (at rest) to 90 ±11 beats/min (max 145 beats/min) and shows irregular but continuous variations from ±8-10% to ±50% of the immediately preceding value within 6-8 to 30-50 sec. The intervening nervous, humoral and metabolic factors (02 consumption during driving) are also discussed. 700366. (P-30) Vehicle Control and Road Holding. Joseph B. Bidwell, Engrg. Staff, General Motors Corp. The state of the art of vehicle control and road holding of automotive vehicles is defined, and the pertinent historical background indicated briefly. It is not intended to be a comprehensive bibliography and chronology of all devel- opments leading to our present state of knowledge, but rather to indicate where we are and possible future activity. The paper is limited to those aspects of vehicle control which are generally considered to be related to vehicle safety. 1970 SA E Transactions 700367. (P-30) Road-Holding: Braking and Traction. Jean Odier, Société Anonyme Française Ferodo. Every car-driver - even an experienced one - is perfectly aware of the steering instability during the braking process. These instability phenomenona will often appear with unpleasant treachery and in a spectacular way that may lead to serious consequences. It proves useful to divide them into two groups - often complementary - to clarify the argument: 1. Defects of braking stability that show up without any wheel-lock-or before locking if locking results. These are the so-called driving stresses, pulls and deviation. When subject to these defects, the vehicle swerves, out by itself from its trajectory, without any driver's action on the steering wheel - except to compensate suitably for the defect, is possible. 2. Defects in braking stability with locked wheels that show up under three possible ways: locking of rear wheels only (with turning round of the car: "slew-round"); locking of front wheels only and losing steering control; and locking of all four wheels simultaneously. Every car-driver is, out of experience, perfectly aware of these phenomena, but he generally does not know how to cope with them when they show up - unless he is very experienced. It is the engineer's craft to look for the causes of these defects, by means of studies and tests, then to make the necessary arrangements for curing them, if possible with an automatic device. Each group of defects is examined, along with recent advances, conclusions, and prospects. This survey is limited to the problems connected with Europe and takes its stand on the authority of a bibliography that, though, not exhaustive, is thorough enough on the last 10 or 15 years. 700368. (P-30) Cornering Ability Analysis Based on Vehicle Dynamics System. Takeshi Nakatsuka and Katsuji Takanami, Isuzu Motors Ltd. Equations of motion with 6 deg-of-freedom are composed of detailed dimensions of vehicle, suspension, steering, and tire which must be determined at the designing stage. Particularly, in the dynamics of suspension system, the hypothesis of fixed roll axis are excluded. And, instead, the effect of side force which affects rolling and vertical motion of the vehicle is introduced on the basis of geometrical variation of the tire's contact points. In addition, a number of equations including the cornering force of tire are treated in nonlinear method, with the effect of driving and braking forces being taken into account at the same time. This analysis has enabled strict interpretation of cornering characteristics. However, this 125</page><page sequence="51">700369-700374 126 article is devoted mainly to the analysis of various phenomena which take place in critical situations re- sponsible for accidents in cornering, resultant from spin-out, drift-out, wheel-life (jack-up) and rollover. The results of computations and experiments are always correlated for the study of suspension specifications, friction coefficient of road, and effects of driving and braking forces. 700369. (P-30) Effects of Compliance on Vehicle Handling Properties. Walter Bergman, Ford Motor Co. This paper reviews various manifestations of compliance and their effects on vehicle handling behavior. It describes the effects of compliance on vehicle steer and roll characteristics and relates them to vehicle safety. Tests to measure the overall steering system compliance and also compliance in individual components of the steering system are described. These measurements are particu- larly important since they relate compliance phenomenon to design criteria. The particular significance of steering gear and structure flexibility in steering system compli- ance is shown. Introduction of compliance in analysis of vehicle roll results in a new concept of roll axis and separation of "kinematic roll axis" from the conventional "dynamic" or "design roll axis". Measurements and computations illustrating the effects of compliance on "kinematic roll axis" are shown. The effects of compliance on overall vehicle handling behavior are shown in numerical sample calculations, performed by using a 6-deg-of-freedom vehicle handling model. 700370. (P-30) A New Procedure for Determining On- The-Road Vehicle Directional Response Char- acteristics. Joseph T. O'Hagan, Jr. and John J. King, Ford Motor Co. A new procedure is described for measuring realistic on-the-road vehicle directional response characteristics. Conventional control system analysis techniques are used in the procedure to derive the transfer function relating steer input to vehicle lateral motion. The influence of the driver's limited torque capabilities on the steering system input is introduced in a non-traditional, though direct manner. This approach produces somewhat different descriptions of vehicle response than have been obtained in the past, when such descriptions did not include this driver influence. Since the resulting transfer function is a unique on-the-road description of the vehicle dynamics, realistic vehicle motion response to any quantifiable steer input can be computed. This procedure offers the additional benefits of test procedure simplicity and minimum test road facility requirements. 1970 SAE Transactions 700371. (P-30) The Directional Dynamics of the Com- mençai Tractor Semitrailer Vehicle During Brak- ing. Philip M. Leucht, Highway Safety Research Institute, Univ. of Michigan. This paper describes an analytical study of a commercial tractor-semitrailer vehicle which is subjected to various brake applications in a turn. A hybrid computer simu- lation of the vehicle is used to investigate the effect of loading condition, brake-torque distribution, brake appli- cation times, and load-sensitive brake-torque control on the directional response of the vehicle during braking. 1970 SAE Transactions 700372. (P-30) Traction Effects While Cornering. F. D. Hales, Loughborough University of Technol- ogy.; and N. F. Barter, The Motor Industry Research Assn. The need to consider automobile dynamic problems, in which the vehicle is subject to longitudinal and lateral forces simultaneously is outlined. Tethered testing is proposed as a method for measuring vehicle behavior under these conditions, and up to the maximum lateral force that can be obtained. The M.I.R.A. tethered testing rig and the associated experimental and data analysis procedures are described. It is shown that the rate of change of steer angle with lateral acceleration, and the rate of change of steer angle with slip angle are suitable quantities for characterizing vehicle steady state behavior, and results are presented in terms of these quantities, to illustrate the effects of combined cornering and traction for front- and rear-wheel drive vehicles. 700373. (P-30) Brake System Component Dynamic Per- formance Measurement and Analysis. D. K. Fisher, The University of Michigan. The results of a comprehensive investigation into the dynamic performance of braking system components are presented. Typical transient and sinusoidal dynamic response data are illustrated from drum and disc brakes, and rigid and flexible brake lines. Laboratory transient response data for complete brake systems are also presented. A generalized brake system mathematical model, based on a component by component analysis, is formulated in detail. The utility of this model in the design of antiwheel lock devices and in human factors braking control investigations is discussed. 1970 SAE Transactions 700374. (P-30) Model 10 Brake Test Instrument. G. W. Landon, General Motors Proving Ground. The Model 10 Brake Test Instrument (BTI) is a servo- controlled, electro-hydraulic device, designed and built by the General Motors Proving Ground. It is designed to apply a controlled force to the car brake pedal. Thus, car braking systems can be evaluated under repeatable pedal applications. The Brake Test Instrument is capable of controlling brake pedal force in any one of four different modes: Mode 1 - It will apply any pedal force selected within the range of 0-300 lb. Mode 2 - It will continuously modulate or vary the pedal force to maintain any selected vehicle deceleration up to wheel slide.</page><page sequence="52">700375-700378 Mode 3 - It will apply pedal force at any selected apply rate within the range of 0-50 lb/sec. Mode 4 - It will continuously modulate, or vary, the pedal force to maintain any selected line pressure in the brake system. For any of these four selected force modes, the BTI can measure and plot any two of the following transducer signals versus a third on its flat bed two-pen recorder: pedal force, pedal travel deceleration, time, brake line pressure or any other externally sensed signal. The BTI is also capable of switching from one force mode to another whenever a preselected value is reached. For example, it will operate in the constant deceleration mode until some selecting pedal force is reached - say 100 lb. When pedal force reaches 100 lb, it then automatically switches to constant force mode and holds this 100 lb for the rest of the brake stop. 700375. (P-30) Automatic Brake Proportioning Device - A Substantial Contribution to Motor Vehicle Safe- ty. Giuseppe Puleo, Fiat S.p.A. Among the most interesting devices introduced in modern passenger car braking systems, the so called "brake proportioners" have marked the beginning of a new era which is bound to have even more resounding devel- opments than enjoyed in the past decade by the disc brakes. The usefulness of the devices in question is easily demonstrable through a theoretical analysis of the braking problem, analysis which permits to establish also what are the requirements, features, possibilities, and limits of the present and future proportioning system. A survey of the numerous devices used or proposed so far discloses the variety of trends followed in this particular sector of braking technique and highlights, among other things, the extreme simplicity of some devices in relation to the importance of the functions performed and the remarkable results they permit to attain. After overcoming the pioneering stage and encour- aged by the flattering successes obtained, the studies on automatic brake proportioning are now progressing at full pace. The main goal of this second stage should be the finalization of automatic proportioning devices apt to control the slippage of the individual wheels, with cost, reliability, and flexibility characteristics permitting their general adoption on mass production cars. 1970 SA E Transactions 700376. (P-30) Factors Affecting the Friction of Tires on Wet Roads. Barbara E. Sabey, T. Williams and G. N. Lupton, Road Research Lab. The object of the investigations described in this paper is to put in perspective the relative roles of the "drainage" and "energy loss" properties of tires in providing good adhesion on wet roads. Different aspects of tread pattern design and tread material are considered in relation to factors external to the tire, the major ones being the influence of water depth over a range representative of conditions on the road, the interaction of road surface texture, and the effect of speed. The method of approach includes full-scale experiments on the British Road Research Laboratory's Track using braked and rolling wheels under carefully controlled conditions, laboratory investigations of the viscoelastic properties of rubber together with rubber friction tests, and theoretical con- siderations linking the different aspects. This work should lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of tire/road adhesion on wet surfaces and in particular to draw the distinction between, and relative importance of, lubrication and aquaplaning. 1970 SA E Transactions 700377. (P-30) An Analysis of Tire Traction Properties and Their Influence on Vehicle Dynamic Per- formance. Howard Dugoff, P. S. Fancher and Leonard Segel, Highway Safety Research Insti- tute, Univ. of Michigan. An analysis is made of the influence of tire-mechanics characteristics on the behavior of an automobile under- going maneuvers requiring the tires to produce combined longitudinal and lateral forces. The mathematical model employed to represent the vehicle incorporates wheel rotational degrees of freedom, and relationships ex- pressing the longitudinal and lateral tire shear force components as analytical functions of tire normal load, sideslip and inclination angles, and longitudinal slip. The tire shear force relationships, derived by extrapolating from existing theory for the traction mechanics of a freely rolling tire, agree qualitatively with available experimental data. Analog simulation results are examined to assess the influence on vehicle steering/braking response of varia- tions of three parameters: lateral tire stiffness, longi- tudinal tire stiffness, and the coefficient of friction at the tire-road interface. 1970 SA E Transactions 700378. (P-30) The Lateral Flexibility of Pneumatic Tire and Its Application to the Lateral Rolling Contact Problem. A. R. Savkoor, University of Tech- nology, Holland. The role of the tire in controlling the vehicle motion rests mainly upon its ability to generate desired lateral forces and moments when rolling at a "slip angle." The paper deals with a method of predicting the lateral character- istics of a rolling tire from the detailed knowledge of its lateral flexibility in the contact region and the law of friction. At first, a method of determining the variation of the lateral flexibility is described, using experimentally obtained distributions of lateral force and deformation with a modified "Gough apparatus." Considering the tire as a running band of a linear structure of high order, the Green's function of lateral flexibility is obtained. Such a function can adequately bring out finer differences due to variation in the constructional parameters and service variables of actual tires. This approach not only enables 127</page><page sequence="53">700380-700383 128 consideration of the lateral flexibility of actual tires in design calculations but also seems to be promising in assessing the "lateral-longitudinal" interactions as well as "normal-tangential" interactions by simple extensions of the methods described herein. The two-dimensional contact problem of a tire rolling at a slip angle is then considered after reducing it to a one-dimensional problem with total slip using a "free rolling factor" to superimpose the free rolling slip on the lateral slip. The resulting problem is qualitatively similar to the conventional one assuming a region of adhesion and is probably a more realistic approximation of the conditions arising at the contact. The problem of the nonstationary motion of a tire initially at rest with slip angle, set into motion, is numerically solved using the Green's function of lateral flexibility and the nonlinear distance dependent part of the law of friction of rubber. The paper shows how the Green's function of lateral flexibility may be combined with the law of friction to predict the cornering characteristics effecting vehicle control. Conversely from the point of view of tire designers, this approach enables optimum selection tire construction and service variables so as to realize a desired cornering characteristic on a given road surface with known frictional properties. 1970 SA E Transactions 700380. (P-30) Motor Vehicle Inspection. Robert Brenner, Lynn Bradford and George Parker, National Highway Safety Bureau. Since the late 1920's, periodic motor vehicle inspection (PMVI) has been performed in various States of the United States. This action by the States was based on the premise that a vehicle with no defects or malfunctioning parts is a safer vehicle than one with defects and, hence, will be involved in fewer accidents. On the face of it, this appears to be a perfectly logical assumption; however, critics of PMVI have continually charged over the years that there is no established association between the safety condition of motor vehicles and accident or death rates. This paper considers, in turn, past approaches to motor vehicle inspection; current activities and practices reflecting "where we are today," and, finally, an overview of new directions in motor vehicle inspection with reference to the research plans of the National Highway Safety Bureau. 700382. (P-30) Inspection of Motor Vehicles for Acci- dent-Causing Defects. Wolfgang Rosig, Deutscher Kraf tf ahrzeug-Überwachungs- V erein e.V. The present analysis is concerned with the inspection of motor vehicles for accident-causing defects. It is based upon surveys which were carried out by technical experts of the Deutscher Kraftfahrzeug-Überwach ungs-Verein DEKRA e. V. during the years 1966-1969 on assignment from police officials. Classification is made according to the type of vehicle, manufacturer, age of the vehicle, number and type of deficiencies identified as well as responsibility for the accident-causing defects. In most categories, the analysis is limited to passenger and combination vehicles, although - to the extent that any assertions can be supported - consideration is also given to other types of vehicles (trucks, trailers, buses, other types of vehicles). A comparison with the registration figures in the Federal Republic of Germany, including West Berlin, emphasizes the conclusions to be drawn from this examination. Statistical development of these principles, along with the corresponding ramifications, clearly points out the fact that a large number of the accidents caused by technical deficiencies can be eliminated through appropriate vehicle supervision. In particular, the type of defects (brakes, tires) and the age of the vehicle (over five years) provide reference points on where to place the emphasis in supervision or, as the case may be, on what the necessary time intervals are for the inspection of the motor vehicle. A breakdown according to responsibility for the defects identified shows that, apparently, the normal motor vehicle owner is not in a position to maintain his vehicle in a continuous state of driving and operational safety. Responsibility on the part of workshops and the manufacturers takes a second seat when compared with the responsibility of the owner. 700383. (P-30) Success and Recognition of the Voluntary Vehicle Inspection Program in the Federal Re- public of Germany. Rolf Moll and Ernst Halbgewachs, Deutscher Kraftfahrzeug-Über- wachungs- Verein e.V. This publication is intended to provide information on how a voluntary vehicle inspection program has been set up in the Federal Republic of Germany under the auspices of a voluntary association of vehicle owners, particularly owners of larger motor vehicle fleets. It is also intended to show the advantages enjoyed by the vehicle owner through such an inspection program and how particular demands on the part of the government are fulfilled without additional expenses. Technical knowledge and acumen gained from the inspection of motor vehicles is systematically analyzed. The results of this analysis from the years between 1966 and 1969, is presented and explained in tabular form. Analysis was performed on an IBM 360 unit so that the frequency of defects related to the type of vehicle, could be statistically ascertained. DEKRA - Deutscher Kraftfahrzeug-Überwach ungs- Verein e. V. (German Motor Vehicle Inspection Asso- ciation, Reg.) - is active on a very large scale as an independent and neutral inspection organization in the field of vehicle inspection as well as in the field of appraising and examining motor vehicles. This report</page><page sequence="54">700384-700389 deals witñ essential aspects of these activities and the successes to be obtained therefrom. 700384. (P-30) Reliability in City Transport Vehicles, Equipment Lifetime and Security. Santiago Estrada Saiz, City Transport Co., Madrid. This paper deals with the statistical study carried out on brake, steering, and engine failures during the life-time of a 210-bus fleet. By the actuarial method and the corresponding distributions (almost all of them Weibull type exponential) schedules on recorded reliabilities, are deduced for the original parts supplied by the manufac- turers, and also vehicle reliabilities when failing parts are replaced. We believe these reliability schedules may be useful when establishing future reliability contracts (nonexistent up to now) for the acquisition of city transport vehicles from the viewpoint of security. 700385. (P-30) Automotive Signaling and Lighting. D. M. Finch, University of California, Berkeley. The last decade has seen a considerable amount of investigation work in the field of automotive lighting with the pace beginning to accelerate in the latter part of this period. Although a good deal of this work has been carried out on a more or less coordinated basis - particularly that sponsored within recent years by Federal Government agencies such as the National Highway Safety Bureau - much of it seems to have overlapped greatly and, in some cases, produced conflicting results or led to somewhat contradictory conclusions. It is thus becoming increasingly important to review and evaluate the work periodically with an eye toward gaining a proper perspective on the situation - the goal, in essence, of this paper. Included in the present review is a brief recounting of the historical highlights in the field, a look at present-day standards and legal requirements, as well as at current industry practices, for automotive lighting, and, for the most part, an examination of the problem areas and the proposed solutions. The subject is treated here mainly from the "hard- ware" point of view and restricted almost entirely to the situation in the U.S. 1970 SAE Transactions 700386. (P-30) Signaling and Lighting. Pierre Devaux, International Commission on Illumination. The state of the art in automobile lighting and signaling are covered from the earliest days of the automobile. The history of the "dipped" beam and the possibilities for improving it are discussed, as well as other techniques for reducing or suppressing dazzle. The European standards for signaling are listed, and methods of improving signaling systems are covered briefly. 1970 SAE Transactions 700387. (P-30) The Controversy Over Rear Lighting and Signaling on Motor Vehicles. Lewis C. Owen, National Highway Safety Bureau, U. S. Dept. of Trans. Improvements in the rear lighting and signaling systems on motor vehicles are warranted to aid in the reduction of rear end collisions. Reports on recent research indicate general agreement on fundamental changes such as separation of function and redundant signaling code; however,« there are- several controversial areas such as the color xDf the lamps. Many of the serious disadvantages of the current systems may be resolved by relatively minor revisions. Other major revisions can therefore be deferred until they have been thoroughly substantiated by later research. 700388. (P-30) Psychological Research in Automobile Rear Lighting. Rudolf G. Mortimer, Highway Safety Research Institute, Univ. of Michigan. The rear lighting and signaling system of automotive vehicles was considered to be one component of the traffic system which was amenable to development to provide improvements in driver performance and, hence, in accident reduction. The problem was discussed in the context of primary and augmenting cue utilization by drivers. Various display techniques were systematically inves- tigated employing number, functional separation, and color coding in addition to intensity and flash coding now used. A static driving simulation and actual driving tests showed that number coding, functional separation, and color were effective in reducing following driver response time, missed signals, and errors. Ratings of signal system effectiveness correlated well with objective data. Studies concerned with color discrimination and visibility in clear and fog atmospheres showed that green-blue would be a practical presence light color. Dual-intensity signals and presence lights, and forward- mounted repeater turn signals, were recommended. The most effective system for giving those signals now in use should have separate presence, turn and stop signal lamps which should be color coded green-blue, amber, and red. Preliminary details of the operation, mounting con- straints, candlepower etc., of such a system are suggested. 1970 SAE Transactions 700389. (P-30) Motor Vehicle Lighting and Self Leveling Devices for Headlamps. Pierre Cibié, Ecole Polytechnique. After summarizing the general automobile lighting prin- ciples, as well as the respective United States and European designs, the author quotes the reasons why a self-leveling device is desirable and in some instances even required. General self-leveling design principles are established and several practical solutions reviewed. More complete details are given on a hydraulic leveler and on how thermic variations are compensated. 129</page><page sequence="55">700390-700395 130 700390. (P-30) Optimum Size of Headlamp for the European Lower Beam. Gerhard Lindae, Robert Bosch GmbH. There are many various forms and sizes of headlamps. It is shown that the surface area of the headlamp is determined by the discomfort glare, that the seeing distance achieved depends on the horizontal dimension of the headlamp, and that height and focal distance of the reflector influence the foreground illumination. By using these determining factors it is possible to find a headlamp which represents an optimum of the given state of geometrical and optical headlamp technology. 1970 SA E Transactions 700391. (P-30) Driver Vision. John Versace, Auto. Safety Research, Ford Motor Co. Human vision is a vast field of scientific study. Although the automotive engineer does not need to know very much about this topic in depth, there are some basic things he should be aware of, particularly if he is concerned with headlights, signal lights, mirrors, the instrument panel, and the design of the vehicle body. This review will briefly touch only upon some of the main facts of human vision pertinent to an automotive engineer's needs. There will be some emphasis on the application of some of these facts, and on the method- ological problems of practical testing and evaluation of vision-related vehicle features. 1970 SA E Transactions 700392. (P-30) Driver Vision Requirements. Erwin Hart- mann, Institut fur med. Optik der Universität München, Deutschland. The motorist assimilates more than 90% of the infor- mation he requires when driving in traffic via the visual system. For this reason, we must make every effort to facilitate the visual information process for the motorist. By this we mean primarily the geometric vision and corresponding tests have been arranged. Many problems arise if it is desired to determine the visibility conditions necessary for the motorist. The scientist is generally confronted with a multitude of uncoordinated data and test results which he has to sight. Moreover, the data, especially those gathered in driving tests on the road, are often based on a much too small number of test personnel to be really representative of the everyday motorist. The obvious idea of analyzing accident reports is similarly not suitable as the reports generally do not contain the desired particulars or only in an incomplete form. 700393. (P-30) Dynamic Visibility of Motor Vehicles. Akira Yamanaka, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.; and Minoru Kobayashi, National Re- search Institute of Police Science, Japan. To obtain the optimum forward visibility, three ex- periments were conducted under various road conditions. Vehicles used were: (1) a high-speed bus having the front window extending to the floor and curtain of variable length arranged on the inner surface; (2) a heavy-duty normal control truck having variable visibility; (3) a passenger car also having variable visibility. An oscill- ograph served to measure items relating to driving performance, time, speed, and forward and rearward acceleration, and a polygraph to measure psychogalvanic response which indicates driver excitability and psycho- physiological reactions. A feeling test was also conducted. The test results were analyzed in terms of eye angular velocity, and it was found that the optimum lower visibility closely connected with 2 rad/sec of the eye angular velocity. This investigation recommends the optimum range of driving visibility for the vehicles. 1970 SA E Transactions 700394. (P-30) Assessment of Automotive Visibility by a Figure of Merit. Richard L. Barnoski, Computer Sciences Corp.; John R. Maurer, Measurement Analysis Corp.; and Andrew B. Kugler, Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc. This paper concerns the development and use of a simple model to assess the direct visibility afforded a binocular driver of an automotive passenger vehicle. The model is mathematic in nature and structured to include a representation of the field-of-view available to either a driver or driver population as well as the visual field required for safe driving. The output of the model, a Figure-of-Merit, is designed to vary over the range 0&lt;^FOM&lt;T00 where "ideal" or "perfect" visibility corresponds to FOM = 100. For thirteen 1969 vehicles tested, the Figures-of-merit ranged from 39.42 to 68.94 with an average value of 56.74. Separate FOM results are provided for the front and rear 180 degrees in azimuth. Such data provide relative measures of "good", visibility for the vehicles considered. Of greater impor- tance, however, is that the model, once refined and appropriately extended, can yield quantitative visibility standards for automobiles. In concept, it readily can be adapted to include trucks, buses, and visual aids such as rear view mirrors. 1970 SA E Transactions 700395. (P-30) Geometric Vision Requirements in the Driving Task. Lyman M. Forbes, Automotive Safety Res. Office, Ford Motor Co. An analysis is made of the driver's forward vision requirements. Various methods for relating vehicle ge- ometry to these vision requirements are examined. Several of these methods were found to have some potential as design tools to assist automotive engineers in placing rear vision systems, determining the proper size and shape for vehicle daylight openings, and to provide a means for evaluating windshield wiping and defrosting patterns. In this study, the relative importance of various vision zones is based on published vision performance and traffic information. 1970 SA E Transactions</page><page sequence="56">700396-700401 700396. (P-30) Automotive Rear Vision. Charles R. Kelley, Dunlap and Associates, Inc. A review of the state-of-the-art in rear vision from passenger vehicles includes such problems as field of view, display location, and display characteristics. Responses to a questionnaire by experts in the field are analyzed. Empirical data are reported on rear vision fixation location and time patterns. Comparisons were made between five different vehicle-mirror configurations driv- en over the same course under typical freeway and city street driving conditions. Large differences were found in the time required to obtain rear view information. It is concluded that drivers are forced to take their eyes from the road ahead for excessively long periods with standard vehicle-mirror configurations, and that this can be greatly improved by improved rear vision systems. 700397. (P-30) Visual Information Seeking of Novice Drivers. Ronald R. Mourant and Thomas H. Rockwell, The Ohio State Univ. Although novice drivers learn to control automobiles with a few hours of practice, the development of their visual information seeking habits takes many months. Films of novice driver eye movements suggested that there are stages of visual learning. Techniques need to be developed to teach drivers where to look before they actually start driving. 700398. (P-30) Human Impact Tolerance. Richard G. Snyder, Highway Safety Research Institute, University of Michigan. Current automotive collision statistics vividly document both the magnitude of man's exposure to impact stress and the endurance limitations set by his relative ragility. While man has always been confronted with the con- sequences of Newton's Laws of Motion, the growing population's increasing dependency upon the motor vehicle for locomotion has outstripped the ability of the highway to safely transport him, the automobile to protect him, and man's own ability to adapt to an increasingly hostile technological environment. Future engineering design for increased protection and survival of automotive vehicle occupants exposed to crash environments will depend largely upon the biological levels of impact stress which are within human recovery limits. Unfortunately, to date few of these limits have been even grossly defined. The objective of this paper is to present an overview of the current status of our knowledge, point out known problems, and discuss future needs and directions. 1970 SA E Transactions 700399. (P-30) Human Impact Tolerance. A. Wisner, Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers.; and J. Leroy and J. Bandet, Impacts Lab., ONSER. When one is led to examine a car which has been involved in an accident and the injured passengers one is always struck by the great difficulty encountered in reconstituting with precision the sequence of events which have led to body injuries. However, there exists no possibility of prevention if certain laws which give account of part of the observed phenomena are not clearly brought out. Thus, various specialists are led to investigate the trajectories of vehicles, the deformation of structure following impact and the displacement of passengers inside the motorist com- partment. This paper is limited to the exploration of the literature concerning the biomechanical characteristics of the human body. 700400. (P-30) Deflection of the Human Thorax Under Sternal Impact. Alan M. Nahum, UCLA Center for the Health Sciences.; and Charles W. Gadd, Dennis C. Schneider and Charles K. Kroell, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. For the purpose of increasing available knowledge of human dynamic response and tolerance to thoracic impact, and experimental investigation of both blunt and localized impacts to embalmed and unembalmed human cadavers is being carried out. This is a progress report to date. Force and deflection time histories resulting from midsternal A-P impacts over a 6 in. diameter area and from blows localized near the costochrondral junctions were measured and cross plotted to provide dynamic force-deflection characteristics. The extent of skeletal damage was assessed by both radiological examination and thoracic dissection and is presented in relation to the impact parameters. X-ray assessment of rib fracture damage was found to be inadequate revealing on the average less than half of the fractures confirmed by dissection. When compared with existing data for embalmed cadavers from a different source, the new results for embalmed specimens demonstrate similar skeletal damage characteristics on a deflection basis but somewhat lower associated forces and thoracic stiffness values. It is suspected that differences in embalming and subsequent storage practice relate to these findings. From the current study the stiffness of unembalmed specimens is somewhat less than that of the embalmed. Many questions concerning human thoracic stiffness and tolerance to dynamic loading remain unanswered at this time, and the work reported here is being continued. 700401. (P-30) Comparative Tolerances for Cerebral Concussion by Head Impact and Whiplash Injury in Primates. A. K. Ommaya, National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke.; F. J. Fisch and R. M. Mahone, Naval Ship Research and Development Center.; and P. Corrao and F. Letcher, Naval Medical Research Institute. Experimental head impact and whiplash injury ex- periments have been conducted in three subhuman primate species in order to define tolerance thresholds for onset of cerebral concussion. Preliminary analysis of the 131</page><page sequence="57">700402-700406 132 data support a hypothesis that approximately 50% of the potential for brain injury during impact to the un- protected movable head is directly proportional to head rotation and inversely proportional to head translation by the impact; the remaining brain injury potential of the blow is directly proportional to the contact phenomena of the impact. A scaling method for injurious rotations is presented which predicts that levels of head rotational velocity exceeding 50 rad/sec and acceleration exceeding 1800 rad/sec2 are compatible with a 50% probability for onset of cerebral concussion in man. 700402. (P-30) Determination of Injury Threshold Levels of Car Occupants Involved in Road Accidents. R. D. Lister and J. G. Wall, Road Research Laboratory. The methods used at the British Road Research^ Labo- ratory to collect data relating to the injuries sustained;by vehicle occupants in road accidents are described. Vehi- cles of differing interior structural design give rise to different patterns of injury to their occupants, the^ probable mechanisms producing these injuries have been deduced from the detailed examination of the damage to the car interior caused by the impact of the occupant during the accident. The damage observed in cars involved in accidents and associated with particular injuries was reproduced on undamaged cars of the same make and model, using a suitable dynamic impact method, to give an indirect assessment of the forces causing the injuries. On the limited data available it is estimated that, in frontal impacts, the threshold value of the force which causes skeletal injury to the knee-thigh-hip complex lies between 2 and 4 kN and that skeletal injuries to the tibia and fibula can occur when the lower leg strikes a structure giving rise to a localized loading and having a maximum dynamic strength of 5 kN or more. 700403. (P-30) A Review of Vehicle Impact Testing: How It Began and What is Being Done. Richard A. Wilson, Safety Research &amp; Development Lab., General Motors Corp. Vehicle impact testing, having its start over 30 years ago, has matured into a highly sophisticated operation which involves many disciplines. The older routines of running cars into things and only looking at after-effects are no longer adequate to answer today's vehicle safety ques- tions. Full scale testing has been supplemented with impact sleds, component impact machines, and computer simulations. Human simulators, or dummies, are used as instrument carriers or as instruments themselves to provide some estimate of the injury that might be produced in various impact situations. All types of impact tests today demand complete, accurate, and immediate measurements of the physical events involved. Instrumentation has evolved which utilizes electronic, photographic, and mechanical tech- niques to record and display impact events which, by their very nature, are over in tenths of seconds. Data reduction systems have been devised to shorten the time and reduce the man-hours necessary to make the data useful. Currently, the major limitations in vehicle impact testing appear to lie in the area of incomplete, human biomechanical information. How to produce the impact is farther along than knowing what bodyform to impact against or impact with. How to obtain and record the data is less a problem than how to interpret the results for injury potential. This paper presents a review of vehicle impact testing as it has evolved in the United States by discussing its history, its various forms, the measurements it requires, and the kinds of information it tries to provide. 1970 SA E Transactions 700404. (P-30) Vehicle Impact Testing. R. H. Macmillan, Motor Industry Research Association. The development and present position of vehicle impact testing outside the U.S.A. is considered. It has been necessary to restrict comment mainly to published work, although undoubtedly this does not include all that is being done. Most of the work so far has concentrated on barrier impact tests but sled tests and special tests of various kinds are also carried out. Much of the instrumentation used is American in origin but European and Japanese equipment is also in use and is commented upon briefly. The main field for immediate future development lies almost certainly in the area of instrumentation. In particular, no completely satisfactory anthropometric dummy is yet made anywhere in the world. 700405. (P-30) Liberty Mutual Automotive Crash Simulator. Nathaniel H. Pulling, Dennis F. Roy, Donald R. Vaillancourt, Allen L. Cudworth and John B. Creeden, Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. A research crash simulator is described which is located at the Liberty Mutual Research Center in Hopkinton, Mass. A 7 ft sled is accelerated by compressed air at speeds up to 60 mph, and then decelerated by a combination of aluminum honeycomb and a hydraulic energy absorber. Normally the sled carries an automotive seat, with some type of restraint system, and an anthropometric dummy. Information concerning collision events in the simulator is obtained from electronic transducers and high speed motion pictures. A number of car occupant protection systems have been tested on this simulator, and typical data are presented to illustrate its performance. 700406. (P-30) Impact-With-Rebound: An Advanced Tool for Laboratory Crash Simulation. William I. Kipp, Monterey Research Laboratory, Inc. This paper shows that the shock motion experienced by the passenger compartment during inelastic impact of an automobile into a barrier may be simulated in the laboratory by elastic impact between a test carriage and a reaction mass. Mathematical derivations show that im-</page><page sequence="58">700407-700413 pact-with-rebound is equivalent to the "impulse" (test specimen accelerated backward from rest) and impact- without-rebound simulation methods. Velocity, displacement, and dimension formulae are derived for all three test methods, and are compared in terms of system performance and configuration. It is shown that for the same performance, the rebounding simulator requires less impact velocity (and therefore less total energy), less shock pulse programmer displacement, and shorter track length than the other systems. One type of rebounding shock pulse programmer is discussed in detail. It is explained how the force- versus-deflection characteristic can be controlled by adjusting internal gas pressures. A typical crash simulation system using the impact- with-rebound technique is briefly discussed. 1970 SA E Transactions 700407. (P-30) An Engineering Approach to Trauma Indicating Organs. Aaron Bloom and Robert W. Duer, Sierra Engineering Co. Discussed is the desirability of developing simulated internal organs and vascular systems which will respond to impact dynamics similarly to humans. Materials currently available and the technical knowledge extant indicate that the fabrication of such body components is now feasible. The potential value of anthropomorphic dummies equipped with such devices as a research tool for the study of injury-producing impact dynamics is out- lined. 700408. (P-30) Potential Applications for the Movable Barrier in Vehicle Crash Testing. Roger J. Berton and Robert B. Maclean, Ford Motor Co. The majority of vehicle crash tests have utilized the stationary barrier. This analysis shows the relationship between a stationary barrier crash and a movable barrier crash. The barrier-vehicle crash is simulated by a simple two mass nonreturning spring system. The relationships between vehicle weight, barrier weight, and vehicle crush are shown. The seat belt loads for various crash conditions are also included to give an indication of the relationships which control occupant deceleration in vehicle-movable barrier tests and vehicle-stationary barrier tests. 700409. (P-30) Photographic Analysis of Impact Tests. S. E. Staffeld, Chrysler Corp. High speed cinématography, commonly used for pictorial coverage of impact tests, can also be an important source of measurements of crash kinematics. An approach to film analysis is used in the Chrysler Engineering Office that makes it possible to obtain such measurements with no camera orientation requirements and few special preparations. By making extensive use of digital computer processing, it has been possible to minimize special purpose mechanical equipment, simplify test procedures, and generally increase measurement capability. 1970 SA E Transactions 700411. (P-30) Truck Crash Testing. E. Franchini, Res. Labs., FIAT. Several tests have been conducted on the safety of cars whereas similar experimental work on trucks is still scarce. This paper reports on the static and dynamic tests run to study the collision of trucks against different kinds of obstacles (barrier, cars, guardrail), wedging of cars under truck side or tail, roll-over, forward-sliding of the load against cab back panel, impact of driver against the steering wheel (with near vertical column). The data lead to the conclusion that, even though the wealth of experimental methods acquired in car tests is applicable in bulk to commercial vehicles, there are several marked differences in the behavior between the two types of vehicle. To name a few: the diverse structural behavior in some types of collision, the reduced possibility of post-collision fires, the different kind of driver- against-steering wheel impact due to the different setting. The information derived from these tests provide indications on the advisability of introducing in the convential designs some changes which, though rather modest, contribute to the progressive improvement of safety of this particular class of vehicle. 1970 SA E Transactions 700412. (P-30) Automobile Structural Crashworthiness. Raymond R. McHenry and Patrick M. Miller, Cornell Aeronautical Lab., Inc. The term "crashworthiness" is taken from aviation safety usage. It is used in reference to the capacity of a vehicle or component for providing occupant protection in potentially survivable collisions. The crashworthiness of an automobile structure may, therefore, be viewed as essentially a measure of its adequacy in relation to the packaging of occupants for collision exposures. Automobile collisions occur with many different kinds of obstacles over wide speed ranges and in a variety of directions; therefore, it is essential in the study of crashworthiness to establish realistic exposure conditions on the basis of actual highway experience in order to permit a rational approach to the problem. The crash performance of a given vehicle structure is determined by the manner in which kinetic energy is absorbed, dissipated or converted (that is, into redirected motions) during a collision. The ultimate measure of crashworthiness must be expressed in terms of the resulting injury hazard for the occupants, and definition of the injury hazard requires an application of human tolerance criteria. It is obvious from the above discussion that the development and evaluation of structural crashworthiness are extremely complicated problems requiring multi- disciplinary approaches. In this review of the current state of the art, relevant publications from the open literature are categorized in accordance with the different aspects of the problem and the specific approaches used. 700413. (P-30) Vehicle Structural Crashworthiness. M. P. Rapin, Automobiles Peugeot (France). 133</page><page sequence="59">700414-700417 134 In a first part the mass distribution is shown to be an important factor of crashworthiness. The front part, in a frontal impact, must be heavier than the passenger compartment and capable of absorbing as much as possible kinetic energy. The passenger compartment is to be light and stiff. In a second part other types of impact (side impact, roll-over, etc.) which apply directly loads to the passenger compartment are studied. It is shown that an improve- ment of crashworthiness is here possible at the expense of structural improvements but that a satisfying solution is not yet gained as concerns side impact. 700414. (P-30) Analysis and Simulation of Vehicle to Barrier Impact. M. M. Kamal, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. An analytic-experimental technique has been developed which provides a capability to predict barrier performance through the use of three new tools. The first is a computer simulation program of barrier impact which requires as input the static crush charac- teristics of eight forestructural components. The second is a vehicle component crusher. Through the use of the two, it is possible to simulate accurately an unlimited number of barrier tests for a vehicle at speeds between 0 and 30 mph. The output of this program includes vehicle motion, deformation, and the dynamic forces transmitted to the passenger compartment. The third is a mathematical model representing a first approximation of the passenger compartment valid in the elastic range. Presently it provides an analytic solution for the stresses and deformations of a vehicle body under a static frontal load. The combined system of analytical models has provided the means for a better understanding of barrier impact and the development of improved crash worthi- ness. 1970 SA E Transactions 700415. (P-30) Behavior of a Specific Body Structure in Crash Testing. F. Cornacchia, FIAT. Investigation into behavior of cars subjected to head-on collisions at increasing speeds, and properties required of body structures to minimize occupants' injury in case of accident. Body structure must provide at all times for interior survival space. Description is made of a front-wheel-drive body structure and its behavior when subjected to head-on and rear end impacts. Stiffness testing, fatigue testing, impact testing at low and high speed have provided all the data needed by engineers to produce a body structure which fully meets current safety standards. 700416. (P-30) Minimization of Occupant Injury by Optimum Front-End Design. D. F. Moore, West Virginia University. The objective sought in this research is the optimization of vehicle deceleration to minimize serious injury and fatalities for harnessed occupants. The injury criterion is head acceleration which from biomechanical considera- tions is not permitted to exceed 80 G. Head injuries account for 70% of accident fatilities, and the most reliable indicator of such injuries is recognized to be head acceleration. Further biomechanical limitations on head motion appear to be the rate of change of acceleration which cannot exceed 1000 G/sec and the injury severity index which is limited to the value 1000. From these criteria, a tentative selection of optimum head acceler- ation profiles for different vehicle impact speeds has been made. These traces serve as the desired output from a 4 deg-of-freedom model of a lap-and-shoulder-belted front- seat occupant. It is required to find the vehicle decel- eration input which causes this optimized head response during a crashing situation. The equations of motion for the occupant have been programmed on a digital com- puter, and the solutions presented graphically. The results show that the optimum vehicle deceler- ation waveform is a flat deceleration versus time history with a superimposed, early-impulse peak. This differs widely from present day car performance. A comparison of existing vehicle deceleration with the ideal traces suggests that the early-impulse criterion can be imple- mented in existing designs by moving the engine block forward. Simple calculations using collision models confirm this finding. Other recommended changes in the design of automobile forestructure include a lengthening of the front-end and a stiffened bumper to distribute impact loads. Using statistical data available from many sources, an empirical equation has been derived to show the savings in fatalities that would result using the optimized design. 700417. (P-30) Field Studies of Rollover Performance. G. M. Mackay, University of Birmingham, England.; and I. D. Tampen, Ford Motor Co., England. This paper outlines the characteristics of rollover acci- dents based on a representative sample of British cars and light vans. The data come from on-the-spot and follow-up investigations of accidents conducted by Birmingham University and the Ford Motor Co. in which damaged vehicles were examined and information from them correlated with injury data obtained from hospitals. Rollovers are either initiated by impact with another vehicle or are simple rolls, the incidence of other types of roll being low. Door opening rates are shown to be high, and the character of roof collapse, in terms of position and amount, is described. The sources of injury to occupants is discussed. Injury to the head or face occurred in 96% of injured occupants. Seat belts, when worn, prevent ejection but cannot offer complete immunity from injury in this type of accident. Some improvements in crash performance are outlined and a tentative testing procedure is mentioned.</page><page sequence="60">700418-700422 700418. (P-30) Motor Vehicle Restraints. Verne L. Roberts, Highway Safety Research Institute, University of Michigan. The study of restraint systems for use in automobiles to minimize or eliminate the second collision with the vehicle interior has been a fertile field for research. This paper makes no attempt to review completely the extensive literature related to this subject but rather attempts to provide a basis for understanding the tools which have been employed and to develop briefly some of the directions for progress in the field. In brief, it can be said that the future for restraint systems, in terms of their protective abilities and their each of use, is promising. The two primary tools of mathematical analysis and test engineering are being combined in a more effective manner. As we develop an effective injury criteria for restraints it may very well be possible, in the near future, to adequately describe the protective potential of a restraint, along with any possible negative side effects, earlier in the development process and thus minimize the lead time required to implement innovations. As automotive restraints become more sophisticated we can direct our attention toward some of the remaining problems of child restraints, school buses and trucks. 700419. (P-30) European Views on Interior Safety. Bertil Aldman, Official Council on Road Safety Re- search, Sweden. The motorization of Europe is lagging behind that of the United States by several years. The rapid development of automotive transportation in most European countries has contributed to an awareness of the dimensions of problems related to road safety. Differences in environ- ment, traffic and vehicle size have led to a different approach to the problem of interior safety. However, in recent years efforts have been made to facilitate inter- national cooperation in research and harmonization of national standards. Optimal crash energy management in exterior and interior automobile structures, necessary for the protec- tion of occupants, can be achieved only, if the dynamic response of the human body can be expressed in physical quantities decisive for the production of injuries. Suitable tools for studies in this field would be more sophisticated models of the human body and the development of such models for some parts of the body are under way in Europe. 700420. (P-30) Aspects of Passenger Safety. K. Burow and E. Fiala, University of Berlin. The kinetic energy of a passenger during the impact is transformed in deformation of the car, elongation of belts, bending of arms and legs, and vulneration. The amount of energy to the different parts of the car and body depends on the possible deformation, displacement, and the tolerable values of deceleration. The problem is studied on a model for passenger and car. Parameters are the outside and inside car defor- mation, initial distance of passenger and car, active forces of the passenger, and safety devices. The influence of the car deformation on the required inside deformation is discussed. The initial distance between passenger and target is very important for passenger without support but of minor influence for supported passengers. 700421. (P-30) Three-Dimensional Simulation of Ad- vanced Automotive Restraint Systems. D. Hurley Robbins, Univ. of Michigan. This paper reports on the development and use of a three-dimensional mathematical model of vehicle occu- pant kinematics for the purpose of studying various seat, restraint system, and occupant configurations in a crash environment. This model includes three masses represent- ing the head, torso, and lower limbs. Contacts between the occupant and a large variety of moving interior vehicle contact surfaces are allowed. Decelerations in the three linear directions as well as vehicle pitch, roll, and yaw can be accepted as input to the computer program. Program output can be presented in the form of tabular listings of kinematic and force variables as well as time-sequenced drawings in the form of 16 mm movies of the occupant configuration within the vehicle and restraint system. A study of the angles and three-dimensional attach- ment points of various seat belt and shoulder harness configurations is presented including tabulated summaries of the computer-generated data. Comparisons are made between the performance of single diagonal, inverted Y-yoke, and double shoulder harness arrangements in both frontal and lateral impact. The paper is concluded by a discussion of how mathematical models of this nature can be used to optimize restraint system performance and an example application of the techniques to rearend impact protection. 700422. (P-30) Optimum Occupant Restraints. John Searle, The Motor Industry Research Assn. The report is concerned with the performance of occupant restraint systems (for example seat belts, collapsible steering columns, or yielding padding) under conditions of frontal impact. Conditions for optimum system per- formance are established on the basis that injury is related mainly to the peak deceleration of the occupant. A mathematical model is proposed which enables peak deceleration of the occupant to the estimated rapidly. Typical results from this model are presented on graphs from which, for given impact parameters such as restraint stiffness and slackness, this peak deceleration may be found. By treating restraint stiffness as a subsidiary param- eter which can always be given its optimum value, the effect is examined of design changes in the vehicle or in the shape of the restraint characteristics, particular consideration being given to the maximum system per- 135</page><page sequence="61">700423-700427 136 formance achievable by optimization of vehicle decel- eration pulse shape. Throughout the report, graphs and other results are given in general nondimensional form, which allows their immediate application to the design of optimum forms of seat belts, safety belts, collapsible steering columns, and the like. 700423. (P-30) Vehicle Interior Safety Constraint System. Roger P. Daniel, Automotive Safety Research Office, Ford Motor Co. Before implementing safety design concepts of the type discussed in the body of this paper, the most careful studies must be undertaken to determine whether a certain design change, made to reduce on cause of injury, does not simply shift the injury pattern to other portions of the occupant's body. Otherwise, considerable time and ex- pense could be expended on an effort that would leave the overall injury picture unchanged. An example of such a possibility is discussed in detail in the paragraphs on the steering assembly, concerning the relationships between rim and hub injuries. Obviously, the efforts toward improved vehicle inte- riors would be simplified if all automobiles were of such a size and shape as to optimize the "packaging" of its occupants. Under such conditions, however a Ford would tend to look like a Maverick, Camaro, or Volkswagen, and the individuality and freedom of choice demanded by the driving public would be further compromised. Of course, no one wants to loose the option of choice. On the other hand, some design principles and occupant injury patterns are so well documented that standardi- zation of a number of basic designs appears certain. As an example, no manufacturer would again use the projecting, pointed steering wheel hubs which were so common 15 years ago. Although the hub areas of current steering wheels are styled to a wide variety of configurations, they all have a generous contact area and are free from obvious pressure-concentrating elements. 700424. (P-30) Active Versus Passive Motorist Restraints. Derwyn M. Severy, Harrison M. Brink, Jack D. Baird and David M. Blaisdell, University of California, Los Angeles. The relative performances are provided for many of the forms of motorist restraining devices evaluated during 139 full scale crash tests conducted over a 20 year period at UCLA. The relative advantages of passive and active restraining devices are described. Some new concepts of passive restraints are illustrated. 700425. (P-30) A Simulation of the Dynamic Properties of Energy Absorbing Materials. William R. S. Fan, Ford Motor Co. In the past viscoelastic materials have been simulated with springs and dampers. It was found that this simulation was very poor for polyurethane foam, a viscoelastic material having general use. This paper describes techniques for simulating the force-penetration properties of viscoelastic materials. It is based on results of pendulum impact tests on poly- urethane foam. Sample thickness, impact, velocity, and impactor shape were varied, with four replications of each test. The simulation accounts for the effects of the variables and gives a very close approximation to the test data. A dynamic-property comparison index is suggested for evaluating foam materials. This index is a ratio of absorbed energy to peak deceleration. 700426. (P-30) Critical Evaluation of Assessment Methods for Head Impact Applied in Appraisal of Brain Injury Hazard, in Particular in Head Impact on Windshields. A. Slattenscheck and W. Tauff- kirchen, University of Vienna. For assessment of the hazard of "internal head injury" in head impact on a windshield, impact assessment methods according to C. W. Gadd (Gadd's hypothesis) and the Vienna Institute of Technology (Vienna hypothesis) are known. These methods are based on diametrically op- posed concepts concerning the cerebral injury process. The respective assessment values of the two methods are severity index S and tolerance value J. Both methods relate assessment of an impact to the so-called Wayne State curve. The methods are examined as to their deviations from this curve and as to the comparability of results. It appears that tolerance value J, which makes use of an analogy to the biological injury process in assessment, compared to severity index S results in better repro- ducibility of the Wayne State curve, is not subject to limitations concerning time duration of impact, and has the simpler (linear) assessment measure. For comparison of assessment results, the values of severity index S must undergo correction. 700427. (P-30) Safety Performance of 30 Mil HPR Laminated and Monolithic Differentially Tem- pered Windshields. L. M. Patrick, K. R. Trosien and F. T. DuPont, Wayne State Univ. Conventional 30 mil HPR laminated and wide-zone monolithic tempered windshields are compared on a safety performance basis from the standpoints of occu- pant injuries from frontal force collisions and injury or loss of control from breakage from high speed external impact of stones. All experiments were conducted with the windshields installed by conventional methods in an automobile. Occupant injury potential as measured by the Severity Index for brain damage at a 30 mph barrier impact simulation was approximately three times as high for the tempered as for the laminated windshields, although only one tempered windshield exceeded the recommeded maximum value of 1000. Severe lacerations resulted in all impacts in which the tempered glass broke. Less severe</page><page sequence="62">700428-700432 lacerations were found for the laminated windshield impacts at comparable speeds. External stone impacts to the laminated windshields at speeds up to 75 mph resulted in only localized damage and had essentially no affect on the driver, while each case of fracture of the tempered windshield resulted in 15-20 lb of glass particles entering the vehicle and causing considerable driver distraction. On the basis of the experimental results of this program, the authors conclude that the safety charac- teristics of laminated windshields are superior to those of the tempered windshields. 700428. (P-30) A New Laminated Windshield Designed to Minimize Laceration. John R. Blizard and John S. Howitt, Corning Glass Works. A new laminated windshield has been developed with the express purpose of reducing the danger of laceration to a vehicle occupant who is thrown into it. This is accom- plished by using a thin, chemically strengthened sheet of glass for the inner ply. This inner layer is provided with stress raisers that will cause it to break before excessively high concussion forces can be developed in the occupant's skull. The windshield and its operating principles are fully described. Module and full-scale tests are described and results are reported and discussed. They show that the new windshield does indeed almost eliminate facial laceration without causing intolerable concussion forces. 700429. (P-30) Safety Improvement of the New Lami- nated VHR Glazing for Cars. E. Plumat, P. Eloy, L. Leger, F. Toussaint and R. Van Laethem, Glaverbel, S. A. (Belgium). Part one of this paper is concerned with a definite aspect of the mechanical performance of the new windshield, namely its resistance to aging and more precisely to abrasion during a normal use. This study is conducted in two directions: the first comprises a fundamental evalu- ation of the comparative weakening effect on safety glasses resulting from either a well-defined single scratch or from a friction or impact of solid abrasive particles. The second, definitely more practical, is directed toward the study of the wipers aging effect on the impact resistance of the conventional and the new VHR wind- shield. Part two is concerned with the biomechanical behav- ior of the new windshields evaluated by impact tests of an anthropomorphic dummy positioned in a full-scale mod- ified car accelerated up to 30 mph and undergoing simulated barrier crashes. Dynamics of the impacts have been recorded with three high speed motion picture cameras. Fundamental parameters such as deceleration peak, impact duration, severity index, and laceration index have been measured. These various studies have been achieved by comparing the new VHR windshield with the conventional car safety glasses. 700430. (P-30) Windshield Injury Potential as a Function of Windshield Installation Method. K. R. Trosien and L. M. Patrick, Wayne State Univ. A series of carefully controlled simulated barrier crashes at speeds of 20-30 mph are used to compare the relative safety of rubber gasket, butyl tape, and polysulfide adhesive methods of installing windshields. Only subtle differences were found in the severity index and the laceration index. There is an indication that the rubber gasket installation has a higher resistance to interlayer tears and the lacerations from impacts to polysulfide installations are slightly more severe. Head attitude at impact was found to have a significant effect on interlayers tears and resultant lacerations. 700431. (P-30) Eye and Eyelid Injuries from Windshields and Means to Prevent Them. G. Holland, University Eye Clinic Düsseldorf. Eye damages caused by fragments of the tempered windshield have increased considerably over the past years and were observed in all German eye clinics and really represent a serious problem. The most serious damages (perforation of both eyes and damages to the surrounding bones and nose) occur when the face hits the lower part of the windshield remaining in the windshield opening. The co-driver is the most exposed. Statistical investigations of the accident circum- stances, the kind of impact, the time of the day, the speeds, and the cause of the accident are investigated more closely. The possibility of avoiding such eye damages by use of seat belts and laminated glass are discussed. 700432. (P-30) Vehicle Exterior Safety. Derwyn M. Severy, University of California, Los Angeles. Collision researchers agree that the design of the vehicle interior is considerably more important than its exterior design, with respect to injury reduction. As usually true for "ladders" depicting orders of priority, attention cannot be given solely to the issues judged most important. Vehicle exterior safety has received some attention but a review of the literature has indicated a decided sparsity of research and information on vehicle exterior safety, considering its relative importance to the overall vehicle safety problem. The front end of the car has always been its design "face," the character of a car is conveyed by this "face" in much the same manner as the character of an individual may be at least superficially conveyed by his face. Standards dealing with vehicle front-end structures should be carefully written so as not to diminish unnecessarily the initiative of the designer and the spirit of character he tries to develop for the "face" or front-end of his vehicle. Complete freedom of vehicle front-end design might once again be allowed if some form of front-end collision protective device becomes common usage. 137</page><page sequence="63">700433-700437 138 700433. (P-30) Interior Safety of Vehicles. J. P. De Coster, Fonds d'Etudes et de Recherches pour la Sécurité Routiere. The exterior safety of vehicles is an important problem when those accidents are considered where a collision takes place between moving bodies of greatly different masses. The importance of the problem is shown by the figures of two tables referring to pedestrians, to users of "two-wheelers" and to the total number of people killed or wounded on the roads of different European countries in the course of 1966. Different sorts of collisions are described and con- clusions drawn - vehicle and pedestrian, "two-wheeler" and another type of vehicle, two dissimilar cars, heavy lorry and car. The last chapter deals with a general outline for possible experiments. 700434. (P-30) The Exterior Collision. A. J. McLean, Harvard School of Public Health.; and G. M. Mackay, University of Birmingham, England. This paper discusses some aspects of accidents in which pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcycle riders are involved. The data for this study come from a larger at-the-scene investigation of road accidents which has been underway in the central part of Britain since 1965. The study was so designed that the sample of accidents would be repre- sentative as far as possible of the national situation in terms of such factors as urban to rural ratio, time of day distribution, and injury severities. Pedestrian accidents are shown to be essentially an urban problem, with marked differences between adults and children both in collision circumstances and con- sequent injuries. Cyclists involved in accidents are mainly male teenagers, and are the least severely injured of the road users considered. Motorcyclists show different accident characteristics according to the environment of the collision. Urban collisions involve many side impacts and leg injuries, while rural collisions are either head-on or rear-end ones. These motorcycle riders are almost always young males, but half of the passengers (either pillion or sidecar) are female. Helmet use is discussed, and the effect of engine size on the accident characteristics is outlined. 700435. (P-30) Vehicle Post-collision Considerations. Arnold W. Siegel and Alan M. Nahum, Uni- versity of California, Los Angeles. The subject of vehicle post-collision considerations and their related effects on the survival of motorists is developed from a state-of-the-art as well as from a technical approach. The paper contains a detailed dis- cussion of certain post-collision considerations. Beginning with a general overview of the state-of-the-art, the authors then discuss events during four immediate post-collision time periods. The general problems of extrication - loss of control, ejection/containment, egress, entrapment, vehicle structure and components, internal load shift, and rescue personnel access are discussed with illustrated examples. Special extrication problems that arise from automobile fire are also covered. These include engine and passenger compartment fires, flammability of materials and fuel storage system integrity. A discussion of Los Angeles City Fire Department data and future data needs of the vehicle designer is included. Other special extrication and vehicle post impact problems of ignition sources, liquid petroleum fuels, tire fires, human tolerance to heat, submersion, rollover, and underride-override collisions are discussed. Post-collision problems of site debris, glass inhalation and vehicle repairs are reviewed. In summary certain design suggestions and design needs are explored. 1970 SAE Transactions 700436. (P-30) Vehicle Post-Crash Considerations. Luigi Locati, FIAT, S.p.A. The problem of the post-crash conditions completes the picture of safety, since the tragic effects of a collision do not develop during the impact only, but, often, after it. The circumstances that may cause or increase the damage are: fire, submersion, difficulty of access to rescue the passengers. Unfortunately, European literature on tests aimed at tackling these three aspects of the problem is very poor. Instead of a review of what has been published, the author purports to prompt further investigation and gives an outline of the work to be done. 700437. (P-30) Motor Vehicle Accident Studies. Wendell G. Eames, Scott N. Lee and James C. Fell, National Highway Safety Bureau. The basic objectives of the paper are to trace the history of motor vehicle accident studies, assess the present state- of-the-art, and discuss the problems that exist. The emphasis is on the method of collection and techniques for analysis of accident and resultant injury data. The studies referenced deal with mass statistics, the in-depth clinical analysis of selected accidents or accident factors, or the application of a combination of both. These studies are directed toward: epidemiology and causes of acci- dents; injury patterns attributable to given components of the interior (or exterior); and component failures con- tributing to the accident or injuries. Most of the referenced studies were chosen on the basis of their historical significance, importance to the problem, and relationship to the basic objectives. The several thousand unheralded and generally un- published accident studies performed by operational agencies within Federal, State and local governments must be acknowledged. These studies, born out of urgent necessity, were, and are, continuing to be conducted in an effort to find solutions to the growing problem. Such studies call for remedial measures to problems concerning current specific operational responsibilities. 1970 SAE Transactions</page><page sequence="64">700438-700441 700438. (P-30) Vehicle Accident Studies. K. J. B. Teesdale, Ford of Europe, Inc. Outside of the U.S.A. some of the main factors in the state-of-the-art in vehicle accident studies may be summed up as follows: 1. Adequate, proved methods and results exist in the main categories of investigation to form a secure basis on which to build a much needed expansion of work in the field. 2. Both nationally and regionally, mass and clinical studies are needed, with cooperative participation from governments, manufacturers/users/designers and inde- pendent areas (universities, etc.). To the greatest extent possible internationally agreed or compatible definitions and methods should be used. 3. Such studies need to be multidisciplinary including technical, human factor, and sociological specialists. 4. Studies must include setting up of controls and followup checks to ensure changes are monitored and remedial measures are evaluated in the only truly meaningful way. 5. Study findings are increasingly used for legislative rather than advisory purposes, hence governments are best suited to evaluate and propose priority areas for action against counter claims from other community needs. 6. Concepts and means for achieving these ends are more appropriately the province of designers, manufac- turers and users who can best make use of changing technology and dovetail safety needs with other public demands to achieve the most timely, economic and attractive compromises. 7. Two main trends exist concurrently; shorter term, more political efforts to achieve early national design orientated legislation, even if results may be mediocre; longer term, more realistically based, moves to achieve more lasting and effective performance orientated meas- ures, even if action is delayed with the danger of the problem becoming very pressing. A working compromise is often needed since both have their good points. 8. The most potent human factor is that of general public attitude and motivation and it is here where success or failure of studies and findings are born. Education is the key once understanding is achieved, hence the importance of psychologists, sociologists , etc. in accident study teams. This is especially true of prevention as opposed to measures of amelioration. 9. One of the most hopeful long term preventive approaches is school pre-driver education. 700439. (P-30) Methodology for Establishing and Oper- ating Productive Accident Investigation Pro- grams. Donald F. Huelke and Harold W. Sherman, The University of Michigan. Based upon nine years of experience in conducting in-depth, clinical motor vehicle accident investigations, the conditions and practices that have been found to be essential to the collection of reliable and adequate information are defined. The role of the director and the selection of personnel for the investigation teams; their qualifications, training, and supervision are discussed. The establishement and maintenance of relationships with the civil authorities, hospitals, and paramedical personnel with which the accident investigations teams must work are explained. Examples from actual experience are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of the authors' accident investigation information in identifying areas where vehicle design improvement are desirable and evidence that corrective action taken by the vehicle manufacturers has proven effective. 1970 SA E Transactions 700440. (P-30) Establishing Motor Vehicle Accident In- volvement - An Epidemiological Approach. Anthony Peranio, Technion.; and Allan Katz, Technion R&amp;D Foundation. The problem of establishing accident involvement rates for road vehicles is a complex one. Difficulties derive from the large number of factors - other than those connected with the vehicle only - in the man-vehicle-road-envi- ronment complex. Proving ground testing of vehicles may lead to results of limited applicability. Long term performance on highways is the ultimate criterion of safety. The results of many studies indicate that accidents attributable to direct vehicle defects amount to only 8% of the total. Study of these data alone is not sufficient to establish the safety performance of a particular vehicle. To establish vehicle accident involvement rates, both for particular vehicles and for systems of vehicles, the authors present a model that has been simplified to include traffic density, vehicle deployment, and driver age three important factors for which epidemiological data are available or may be obtained. In addition, using a novel graphical technique, comparisons of vehicles for varia- tions in accident rates and exposure (mileage) is per- formed with ease. The exposure-accident graphs of this technique permit meaningful analysis of accident rate trends. Examples are presented for classes of vehicles oper- ating in the United States and Israel, and a "case study" is made for evaluating the accident involvement rate of typical 2-door, medium-priced passenger car. 1970 SA E Transactions 700441. (P-30) Causes of Car Accidents. F. Leygue, Organisme National de Sécurité Routière.; and Jean L'Hoste, Organisme National de Sécurité Routière. Between 1965 and 1968 the French National Council for Road Safety (ONSER) carried out a thorough clinical study on a small sample of accidents. On the spot as soon as possible after the accident, an engineer examined the vehicles involved, in particular the state of the main safety equipment. Then he tried to establish whether this state had played a role in the accidents or not. 139</page><page sequence="65">700442-700449 140 A psychologist interviewed the drivers with a partic- ular view to obtaining data on the relation between man-machine, type of driving, driver's opinion of his vehicle, and previous accidents.

Cameron, Australian Road Research Board. Described is a new method which has been found suitable to supply mass data of road aqcident exposure for the comparison of risk potentials of various driver, vehicle, and road network characteristics with each other. The main body of the paper presents a selection of accident involvement rates of cars per 108 miles of performance obtained by the described method. The rates given compare risk potentials of cars of various age classes and years of manufacture used in Metropolitan Brisbane in 1961. The effect of some driver-attributes (age and sex), the day of week of occurrence, and the power/weight ratio on the size of the studied car-involvement rates is discussed. 700443. Unsteady Flow in the Induction System of a Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engine. G. P. Blair and J. A. Arbuckle, The Queen's Univer- sity of Belfast. Pressure-time variations are recorded in the intake pipe and crankcases of a motored, crankcase compression, piston ported, loop scavenged two stroke cycle engine over a range of engine speeds 2000-7000 rpm, for several intake pipe lengths and different inlet port timings. These pressure-time histories are presented together with the results of theoretical calculations which include unsteady flow in the induction tract. Predicted delivery ratio trends are compared with measured values over the range of engine speeds and inlet tract lengths for different inlet port timings. Discussion: A.

Roy Richter, Cragar Industries. The increased popularity of the cast nonferrous styled wheel has created a need for performance testing of these wheels. Styled wheels are normally used on the same applications as standard OEM steel wheels so they should be expected to pass the same test requirements. However, the difference in physical properties of the two materials dictates a change in test load as well as a redesign in some commonly accepted test equipment. 700445. An Approach to High Speed Wheel Testing. El vin E. Tuttle, Motor Wheel Corp. A high speed, natural frequency type, fatigue testing machine has been evaluated for testing automotive wheels. Rim stress correlation between service loading and machine loading is good and fatigue failures are produced in the predicted areas of the rim. Although fixtures were modified to test other parts of the wheel, no consistent patterns of failure were apparent. The value of this type of testing is that a large number of load cycles are applied in a short time. Its first use will be as a quality control check in manufacturing rims. 700446. Wheel Development at Chrysler. L. D. Gschwind, Chrysler Corp. In the late 1940s a series of three laboratory fatigue tests for development of passenger car and light truck road wheels was experimentally developed. Each of these tests evaluate specific portions of the wheels and thereby reduce development time by allowing more concentrated effort. Rim and disc tests are performed by loading the test wheel through a tire against a drum to duplicate abusive wheel loadings on a vehicle. The value of these tests has been confirmed by good correlation between laboratory and proving grounds testing as predicted in the development of the test. Additional laboratory and vehicle wheel tests are also described. This family of tests is used for development of new wheel designs and not for production quality control testing. 700448.

Wyman, Reynolds Metals Co. A brief description is given of the wide variety of characteristics produced by plating aluminum. The char- acteristics which make aluminum different in plating response, methods in wide use today, and a brief history of plating development on aluminum are described herein. The specific large use areas such as tin and silver plates on aluminum in the electrical industry, and hard chromium plating of general industrial end uses, are detailed. A new "breed" of finish entailing either electroplating or hard- coat anodizing, combined with infusion with fluorocarbon resins for extreme wear resistance and low coefficient of friction is described. Throughout the paper, it is pointed out that aluminum has and will continue to replace the expensive and hard to attain "red" metals, (copper and bronze), in much of the industry. The economics of specific examples are given to illustrate both how and why</page><page sequence="66">700450-700456 plated aluminum is more than competitive with these metals. 700450. Optimum Restraint Parameters for Bounded Occupant Motion in Decelerating Vehicles. Joseph C. Free, Charles Y. Warner and Timothy A. Hoyt, Brigham Young University. The problem of occupant impact severity reduction by effective use of available space was studied using a two-degree-of-freedom linear mathematical model im- plemented on a digital computer. An optimum-search method was employed to find the best values of stiffness and damping terms for linear lap and shoulder "belts" corresponding to specific vehicle pulseforms and geometry at speeds 10 to 60 mph. System performance was evaluated on the basis of a severity index comparing occupant decleration data, and upon penalities imposed for occupant contact with vehicle interior structures. Comparison to biomechanical data indicates that the optimal linear system for 60 mph could produce serious injuries. Comparison to theoretical optimum values indicates considerable room for improvement, using active or nonlinear passive systems. 1970 SA E Transactions 700451. Seat Belt Users: An Analysis of Who They Are and Why. Rodney H. Dobson, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. Surveys conducted by du Pont reveal the motivational factors involved in seat belt usage. Results of questions put to du Pont employees and others reveal that pressure generated within small groups, for example, fellow workers, is needed to make seat belt usage psychologically acceptable. Therefore, promotional and education cam- paigns directed toward the individual as a member of a large group (his community) are not effective. Overall seat usage levels will be increased only by the piecemeal method of reaching one small group and then another, until all drivers are touched. 700452. Automatic Falling Occupant-Protecting Net - Preliminary Study. Shin Maki, Hiromichi Uchiyama and Katsuzi Oy ama, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; and Akira Shimano, Niles Parts Co., Ltd. An automatic, falling, occupant-protecting net is being developed for spreading in front of automobile occupants in the time interval between vehicle impact and occupant collision. The device is designed to conteract forward body acceleration and minimize head, neck, and chest injuries. Thij device was investigated by sled and barrier tests using anthropomorphic dummies. Significant improve- ments in occupant kinematics and remarkable reduction in head and chest impact force has been observed. Some problems such as whiplash injury awaiting solution but continuing investigation of proposed measures of correc- tion show that they are not insurmountable. 700453. Cushioning and Load Distribution Performance of Plastic Foams. W. M. Lee and B. M. Williams, The Dow Chemical Co. Cushioning and load distribution performance of plastic foams was investigated, using a human faceform as the loading object. A technique for measuring contact surface between faceform and plastic foam was developed. Transferrable paint applied to the foam facilitated determination of average stress over its surface, which in turn was employed to evaluate load distribution properties of the foam. Impact and static testing results on several plastic foams were analyzed. It was found that a good cushioning material characterized by low peak decel- eration might show high average stress, thus making it an inefficient load distributor. The faceform used in the study incorporates the effect of face geometry during loading and thus provides a realistic simulation. Variation of material response with loading geometry and possible correlation between load distributing properties and ridigity of the foam are also discussed. 700454. Automotive Dynamic Testing - A Modern Ap- proach to a Modern Need. R. A. LeMense and D. E. Felt, A. O. Smith Corp. A versatile full vehicle test facility incorporating electro- hydraulic excitation and novel facility design offers great potential for useful testing. Facility description, appli- cation, and results produced are discussed and illustrated. Much development effort went into the evolution of the test equipment which was designed to meet objectives of both durability and vibrational measurements. Advan- tages of pit installation for the seismic mass and power room are aspects of the physical setup contributing efficiency and cleanliness. Programming techniques used to obtain good results with the equipment include magnetic tape profiles of durability courses as well as function generators and the system master program panel.

A new electrohydraulic road simulator reproduces oper- ating conditions for laboratory structural testing and evaluation of complete vehicles up to 80,000 lb gvw. Vehicles with either single or tandem axles can be accommodated. The versatility and time savings asso- ciated with the method allows complete vehicles to be structurally tested or evaluated in a matter of weeks. 700456. Ability of Gasoline Additives to Clean Engines and Reduce Exhaust Emissions. K. L. Kipp, J. C. Ingamells, W. L. Richardson and C. E. Davis, Chevron Research Co. Carburetor detergents introduced in the early 1950s were capable of keeping carburetors clean and thus prevented 141</page><page sequence="67">700457-700461 142 engine malfunction caused by this source. However, these detergents generally would neither keep PCV valves clean, nor prevent ring belt deposits, and usually did a poor job of cleaning up dirty carburetors on vehicles used in severe services (taxis). Chevron Research has developed new gasoline additives that keep carburetors clean and remove existing deposits from carburetors. These additives also clean up intake manifolds, intake ports, intake valves, and PCV valves. In addition, they assist in keeping oil rings free and clean. Information obtained from numerous field and laboratory engine tests of these new additives in preventing engine deposits and reducing exhaust emis- sions is discussed in this paper. 700457. The Effects of Some Engine, Fuel, and Oil Additive Factors on Engine Rusting in Short-Trip Service. Loren G. Pless, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. Forty-one short- trip service tests were run using 1964-1969 model U. S. passenger cars and 19 commercial or experimental oils evaluating several aspects of engine rusting. These factors included differences in rusting severity among engine models, effects of fuel variables on rusting, and the effects of oil additive type and concen- tration on rusting. Rusting severity varied widely among engine models, but different engines ranked similarly the rust protection provided by oils with differing additive treatments. Use of either nonleaded gasoline or LPG instead of leaded gasoline greatly reduced engine rusting. At equiavlent additive treatment levels, several mag- nesium sulfonates provided better rust protection than did certain calcium sulfonates, calcium phenates, or a barium sulfonate. Rust protection increased greatly and approx- imately linearly with increasing magnesium content. From these tests, and those reported by others, there appear to be three requirements for engine rusting to occur: 1. Addition to the crankcase of corrosive products from the gasoline lead antiknock scavengers and com- bustion products. 2. Cold engine operation, permitting condensation and accumulation of corrosive products in the oil. Depletion of rust-preventing oil additives. Since the first two requirements are at presently largely uncontrolled from the customers' standpoint (most gasolines are leaded and contain scavengers, and winter weather is cold in many areas), the only other apparent avenue for improving the rust protection provided to current-design engines using leaded gasolines is better rust-preventing additives in oil.

A test method suitable for evaluating the lubricant oil influence on surface ignition has been developed. The effects on this phenomenon of oils without additives, oils with ashless additives, and oils with organometallic additives have been studied. In addition, the influence of additive introduction rate in the combustion chamber has been investigated and evaluated. 700459. The Evaluation of Phosphate Coatings for Cor- rosion Protection and Appearance. Walter R. Cavanagh, Hooker Chemical Corp. The current practice of evaluating heavy phosphate coatings by determining the resistance of the oiled coatings to the Salt Spray test is questioned. Comparisons of various coatings exposed to Salt Spray and out-of-doors with no oil finish, and with several oils, are shown. Based on the lack of correlation shown in these tests, it is recommended that more attention be paid to the actual performance of these coatings in use, and the correlation of these data with various tests. 700460. The Chemistry of Zinc Phosphate Coatings. G. Dale Cheever, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Zinc phosphate coatings are composed of a maze of crystals on steel surfaces and act as absorptive media for organic materials. These coatings find extensive use in the automotive, appliance, and building trade industries. A brief review is given of the processes occurring during the formation and growth of the crystals, their composition, and capillary or absorption properties. These studies led to the development of GMR Ferrotest which gives in one minute the corrosion resistance of zinc phosphate coatings and correlates well with conventional salt spray testing. Discussion: R. L. Faunce, Ford Motor Co. 1970 SA E Transactions 700461. Automotive Experiences with Phosphate and Oil Coatings. George L. Sukes, Cadillac Motor Car Div., General Motors Corp. Automotive requirements for phosphate and oil coatings, as applied to a variety of parts such as nuts, bolts, washers, fasteners, hood hinges, and brackets, are pri- marily based on the corrosion protection provided by the coating system. The automotive specifications covering the degree of corrosion resistance required, for a given application, normally stipulate the neutral salt spray test as a means of evaluating the quality of the coating system and may vary from 24-168 hr of exposure time. To comply with these corrosion resistance require- ments, part suppliers use a number of proprietary phosphatizing processes in combination with an even</page><page sequence="68">700462-700468 larger number of specially compounded rust preventative petroleum products, either as water emulsions or solvent cut-backs. Some of these combinations of phosphate and oil systems have been more successful in consistently meeting the corrosion resistance requirements, as meas- ured by the neutral salt spray test. This paper presents the results of two independent evaluations of the corrosion protection afforded by a variety of phosphate and oil coating systems. In addition, the corrosion protection of these systems as measured by a new test method is briefly discussed. 700462. SAE Study - Wet Pavement Braking Traction. R. H. Spelman, General Tire and Rubber Co.; H. D. Tarpinian, Uniroyal Tire Co.; D. E. Johnson, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.; and K. L. Campbell, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. This four-part study is based upon tests planned and conducted by the SAE Tire Committee. The introductory remarks are written to give a brief outline of the complexity of tire traction measuring procedures and to describe the methods used in this work. The second part of the study deals with the methods used. Three basic methods were used, based upon stopping distance, vehicle deceleration, and towed skid trailers. In the third section, the results are analyzed. Test data from various types and sizes of tires are presented which show the effect of tire wear, vehicle speed, and various test surfaces. The study is finalized with conclusions and recom- mendations. Conclusions permit us to offer a basis for establishing minimum values expressed as related to a standard for straight ahead motion for passenger tire traction on wet pavement. Recommendations are offered for future activity. Discussion: H. R. Clemett, Ford Motor Co.; F. D. Smithson, General Motors Proving Ground 1970 SAE Transactions 700463. Continuing Improvements in Electrocoating. Gilbert L. Burnside, George E. F. Brewer and Gordon G. Strosberg, Ford Motor Co. The electrodeposition of paints has found wide spread interest. In an electrocoating process, aqueous dispersed macroions deposit on a work piece through the action of an electric field. Complete automotive bodies were electrocoat-primed in a pilot installation in the Ford manufacturing development center and subsequently completed vehicles were subjected to test runs on the Ford Arizona proving grounds to determine the corrosion resistance of the electrocoatings. Based on results of these test track runs, electrocoating tanks were installed in a number of Ford assembly plants. A comparison of Salt Spray Tests, 40-cycle Test Track Runs, and cars that have been reacquired from customers after five-year use in the Detroit area as methods for evaluating the durability of electrocoats is presented. Improvements in electrocoating are continuing, partic- ularly in their ability to protect recessed areas against corrosion. 700464. Production Aspects of Electrocoating. Olin W. Huggard, Cleveland West Plant, Mobil Chem- ical Co. Three areas of required performance for a "production feasible" electrocoating system for automobile body priming are discussed: the need for corrosion protection over a much wider curing temperature range than previously defined; the need for a close examination of other materials used in the fabrication of the auto body, which could result in surface defects known as "craters" in the electrocoated film; and the relationship between some physical and chemical properties of the electrocoating paint and the design of a feed system for a base deficient feed. 1970 SAE Transactions 700466. Automotive Coatings and Pollution. A. W. D. Vos and J. Smarsh, Industrial &amp; Chemical Product Div., Ford Motor Co. Painting in the automotive industry is big business. Vehicles are painted primarily to provide corrosion protection and to enhance eye appeal of the product. It is estimated that approximately 50 million gal of paint are used annually to produce the cars and trucks in the United States. The basic processes in painting automotive sheet metal and bodies are metal finishing, cleaning and phosphate coating, primer or undercoat application, baking or curing, wet sanding, color or topcoat application, and final bake. With some modifications, this is essentially the processing used in the entire automotive industry. In the steps of paint processing just mentioned, each day be a source of some type of pollution, either air or water. Various types of air and water pollution and the relationship to each processing step are examined. 700467. Humidity Effects on Engine Nitric Oxide Emis- sions at Steady-State Conditions. J. A. Robison, Ford Motor Co. The effect of humidity change on engine nitric oxide emission during operation on the engine dynamometer was found to be a function of air-fuel ratio, observed nitric oxide concentration level, and observed humidity level. Equations and graphs to adjust nitric oxide concentrations for humidity change were derived. Ad- justments in NO concentration varied from 3.5 to 1 1 ppm per grain moisture change in absolute humidity. Discussion: W. J. Brown and R. V.

Loeser, Chrysler Corp. This investigation indicates that a flame ionization (FID) analyzer can provide adequate response speed and accurate hydrocarbon analyses of automotive exhaust if a slight modification of commercial instruments, as well as adherence to specific operating conditions, is made. Under these circumstances the FID analyzer follows transients such as the California cycle at least as well as the standard NDIR hydrocarbon analyzer. The nearly uniform response of the FID to all hydrocarbons is much superior to the NDIR instrument. The greater sensitivity of FID analysis at low hydrocarbon concentrations is also well known and is corroborated here by test results obtained with three FID analyzers of the same manu- facture, which proved to be in good agreement. 700469. Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emissions from Automotive Engines. Charles R. Begeman and Joseph M. Colucci, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Emission rates of benzene-soluble matter (tar), benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), and benz(A)anthracene (BaA) were determined for gasoline engines and automobiles in simulated city driving, and for a diesel engine in simulated city bus operation. A study of the effects of operating conditions and fuel factors indicated that for minimum exhaust emission of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, engine should be operated with minimum lubricating oil in the combustion chamber of exhaust system, maximum air/fuel ratio, minimum aromatics (especially polynuclear aromatics) in the fuel. On a concentration basis, emissions of BaP and BaA from gasoline engines were greatest during decelerations, and on a mass emission basis were greatest during accelerations. For a group of 25 cars, the average BaP emission rates were 6.6 ug/M3 exhaust or 169 ug/gal gasoline. BaA concentrations were approximately four times higher. Tar emission was approximately 0.2 gm/mile. Emission control systems for reducing volatile hydro- carbons and carbon monoxide in exhaust also reduced polynuclear aromatics in exhaust. Emissions from a diesel engine on a city bus cycle were 62 ug BaP/gal fuel, and 1.4 gm tar/mile. Discussion: G. P. Gross, Esso Res. &amp; Engrg.

Starkman and R. F. Sawyer, University of California, Berkeley. A theoretical and experimental investigation has been carried out in an attempt to determine the effect of fuel composition on the exhaust emission levels of carbon monoxide and nitric oxide from a reciprocating spark ignition engine. Fuels considered in the investigation were representative of the aromatic, paraffin, cycloparaffin, and olefin families. Results show that both energy content and hydro- gen/carbon ratio of the fuel are instrumental in predicting the carbon monoxide and nitric oxide concentrations present in the exhaust. In addition, it has been accom- panied by an increase in nitric oxide and, to a lesser extent, an increase in carbon monoxide exhaust concen- trations. 700471. The Reaction of Ethane in Spark Ignition Engine Exhaust Gas. S. C. Sorenson, University of Illinois.; and P. S. Myers and O. A. Uyehara, University of Wisconsin. This paper describes a method for studying reactions of hydrocarbons in S.I. engine exhaust gases. The reaction of ethane is described using an Arrhenius model ex- perimentally (e = 86,500 cal/mole) for the rate of ethane disappearance and empirical correlations for distributions of the products carbon monoxide, ethylene, formalde- hyde, methane, acetylene, and propane as a function of the fraction of ethane reacted. The results show that the nature of partial oxidation products from a nonreactive hydrocarbon may be less desirable from an air pollution viewpoint than the initial hydrocarbon. 700472. The Disappearance of Ethylene, Propylene, n- Butene, and 1-Butene in Spark-Ignition Engine Exhaust. H. W. Sigworth, Jr., P. S. Myers and O. A. Uyehara, The University of Wisconsin. Ethylene, propylene, n-butane, and 1-butene, which make up a large portion of the photochemically reactive hydrocarbons in automotive exhaust, were reacted in- dividually and as a mixture in a turbulent flow, heated reaction tube made of mild steel. Methods of predicting the total hydrocarbon dis- appearance by use of a general empirical equation are presented. Techniques for using hydrocarbon composition and carbon monoxide data to predict exhaust photo- chemical reactivity and CO concentration from total hydrocarbon disappearance correlations are suggested. Results show that total hydrocarbon reaction was generally strongly dependent on temperature and on oxygen concentration between 1% and 5%, and was less dependent on initial hydrocarbon concentration. Gas Chromatograph data showed that during certain individual hydrocarbon reactions, the formation of other photo- chemically reactive hydrocarbons could increase smog- forming potential despite a decreasing total hydrocarbon concentration. 700473. Spinvision: A New Look at Dynamic Tire Tem- perature. John E. Cori and Chester F. Schwall, Jr., The Armstrong Rubber Co. Recently, a unique image derotator has been developed which will permit a continuous stationary view of a tire</page><page sequence="70">700474-700480 actually moving at very high angular velocities. This device, called Spinvision, has been combined with a special infrared camera and monitor which allows engi- neers to observe instantaneous change in the heat patterns on the surface of a rotating tire. With conical mirrors around the tire, almost the complete surface may be studied, under loaded conditions, at speeds in excess of 150 mph. The intended application if this equipment is to locate potential faults in tires, while they are originating, instead of depending upon post-failure examination for analysis. It may be also possible to explore the relationship between heat patterns and tire wear, and tire uniformity. 700474. Thermal Analysis of a Rolling Tire. N. M. Trivisonno, The B. F. Goodrich Co. A complete steady-state thermal analysis was made for a rolling passenger tire. A numerical network analysis was used which involved the solution of a set of simultaneous heat balance equations. Conduction within the tire, conduction to the road surface, convection to the contained air and to the surrounding air, and radiation from the outside and inside surfaces of the tire were taken into account. The experimentally measured infrared surface temperature distribution was used as input data. The results gave the complete distribution of temperatures and rates of heat generation in the tire. The calculated power loss and shoulder temperature of the tire agreed well with experimental results obtained on an indoor road wheel. Radial and bias ply rayon tires of equivalent size were compared. The radial tire ran cooler and had lower power loss. 700475. Surface Temperature of Running Tires Using Infrared Scanning. F. S. Conant, G. L. Hall and J. D. Walter, The Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. An infrared line scanning system has been used to measure surface temperatures of automobile tires under operating conditions. A designed experiment was em- ployed to demonstrate statistically the individual and interaction effects on tire temperature profiles of changes in tire speed, inflation pressure, and wheel load. These effects are different at different radial positions on a given tire and are quite dependent on tire construction, as illustrated by application to bias, belted-bias, and radial tires of comparable sizes. 700476.

In addition, the use of glass fibers as a belt material for tires has improved abuse resistance, tread wear and handling characteristics. Chopped impregnated glass fiber bundles have also found application as reinforcements for tread shock in off-the-road tires. In this paper physical property characteristics of glass fiber and rubber stock containing chopped glass fiber will be discussed. 700478. High Performance Epichlorohydrin Elastomers for Automotive Applications. Robert W. Turner, Hercules Inc. Elastomers of polyepichlorohydrin and poly(epichlo rohydrin-ethylene oxide) have been of interest to the automotive and rubber fabricating industry since 1965 because of these polymers balance of properties - oil resistance, ozone resistance, heat resistance and low temperature flexibility. This paper presents and discusses recent studies of 40 day, 125 and 150 C aging of the elastomers in oil and air. Comparison with nitrile rubber under the same conditions is shown. Permeability of the polymers to air, propane nitrogen and Freon is shown at 24 and 119 C. The Maxwell Rotating Rod Tester was used to show the effect of temperature on dynamic modulus and loss factor. In addition to the chlorohydrin rubbers EPDM and butyl were studied under the same testing conditions. General suggestions for applications of these polymers are made. 700479. Automobile Windshields, Surface Deterioration. Merrill J. Allen, Indiana University. Thirteen used windshields from General Motors auto- mobiles were randomly selected for test. Code monograms on each indicated they probably were the original r equipment windshields. Photographs were made through each, of the scattered light surrounding automobile headlights. Damage from windshield wiper action seemed to be related to miles of travel; damage from hand cleaning and ice scraping operations was unrelated to age or mileage. Pitting from small high velocity particles was observed. When subjectively rated, 8 of the 13 windshields were judged to cause noticeable increase in headlight glare, and warranted consideration of replacement with a new windshield, were judged to be unsafe for night driving. 700480. Windshield Optics. M. J. Irland, Ford Motor Co. Some undesirable optical effects that arise from design of windshields - such as double images, distortion, astig- matism, and differential deviation of line of sight - are discussed. The reasons for, and method of eliminating, "ghost" images are reviewed. Curvature and tilt angle are principal design parameters available for control of ghost images. Another factor causing double images is wedge. Several illustrations show how cylindrically curved auto glass produces astigmatism. Glass parameters which produce astigmatism of 1/4 diopter are rather severe, however. The amount of differential deviation depends on angle of view, and on curvature, thickness, and refractory index of the glass. It is desirable to minimize differential 145</page><page sequence="71">700481-700485 146 deviation since there is no room for error in making quick assessments of critical traffic situations. The author concludes that factors causing undesirable optical effects, as detailed in this paper, are understood, and means of control are under development in order to eliminate them from future glass designs. 700481. Safety Performance of Laminated Glass Struc- tures. R. G. Rieser and J. Chabal, PPG Indus- tries, Inc. Full scale laboratory studies using curved laminated safety glass windshields, a horizontal accelerator, and a 50 percentile dummy to provide impact performance are presented. Lacerative damage based on moist chamois face covering and Severity Indices for annealed glass windshield configurations were obtained on the current domestic automobile windshield, experimental thin an- nealed glass windshields in symmetrical and asymmetrical glass configurations, and windshields with 0.045 in. HPR interlayer. Symmetrical thin glass windshields, such as, 0.050 in. glass, gave excellent performance to 38 mph. Lacerative damage decreases as the inboard glass thickness decreases for windshields having 0.030 in. HPR interlayer and 1/8 in. float glass outboard ply. Windshields with 0.045 in. HPR interlayer, designed to improve penetration resist- ance, have somewhat higher Severity Indices. Such windshields will require further study. 700482. An Improved Windshield. H. M. Alexander, P. T. Mattimoe and J. J. Hofmann, Libbey-Owens- Ford Co. A windshield research program has been conducted at Libbey-Owens-Ford's Technical Center during the past two years which required the destructive testing of aoubt 4500 production size experimental windshields. Safety performance characteristics were investigated as affected by (1) thicker plastic interlayer, (2) thinner and thicker glass plies and (3) plate versus float glass. These data provide a basis for recommendation of an improved windshield design. 1970 SA E Transactions 700483. Injuries in Underride-Override Collisions - a Clinical Study. Michael R. Appleby, Donald C. Bischof f, Arnold W. Siegel and Alan M. Nahum, University of California, Los Angeles. Automobiles damaged in collisions in which the man vehicle structure has been underridden or overridden were studied, as well as injuries to occupants of the automo- biles. The parameters that affect injuries are listed and discussed, as are the effects of these parameters for each case example. Recommendations are made for modifications of passenger cars, trucks, trailers, and highway furniture to mitigate the severity of injury in underride-override collisions. 1970 SA E Transactions 700484. Safe Transport of Fissile and Radioactive Mate- rials. James H. Edgerton, U. S. Army Trans- portation Engineering Agency. The transport of increasing amounts of Army fissile and radioactive materials in the United States is presenting many technical problems because of the hazards asso- ciated with their movement.lt is essential that criteria, guidance, and performance standards be established for transportation to facilitate safety during movement of these materials by all modes. The basic considerations in the transportation of fissile and radioactive materials are that they may present hazards to the health and safety of the transportation workers, passengers, people along the right-of-way, and the general public. Complying with all countries' regu- lations will provide for the control of these potential hazards by considering three basic factors: relative hazard potential of these items or materials, packaging per- formance standards, and the transportation environment expected. These regulations will be used during the research, development, test, and evaluation stages to meet the requirements for normal conditions of transportation and also on the environmental conditions that they might encounter during an accident. Packages and containers for hazardous materials will be designed and constructed to insure safety during transportation by providing adequate containment, lifting devices, tiedown devices, blocking, bracing, and slinging and structural require- ments. Also, criticality and shielding and heat decay will be considered if fissile and large quantities of radioactive materials are to be transported. Adequate procedures will be provided to assure that the determination and control required by these regulations are accomplished. Results from accidents, possible effects following release of radionuclides, and some suggestions for reducing the probability of an accident are discussed. Definitions, significant and extensive changes to federal regulatory agencies regulations, and health physics aspects of radiation control are thoroughly explored. Future plans for improving safety during transportation are proposed. 700485. Type 66 Nylon Resins. F. M. Cash and H. H. Goodman, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc. The first part of this paper describes air and gasoline heat-aging tests on various type 66 nylon resins. The results are pertinent for evaluating the suitability of these nylons for automotive applications such as the emission control canister and the gasoline vapor-liquid separator. In addition, data is presented to demonstrate that road salt caused no deterioration on test bars made from various 66, 610 and copolymer nylon resins which are in contact with galvanized zinc sheets in an acid envi- ronment. The second part of this paper discusses a survey which was made of a variety of automotive parts made of 66 nylon and acetal homopolymer to determine their quality after extended service. Parts including body, chassis, engine, and transmission components were removed from</page><page sequence="72">700486-700491 high mileage cars. Parts were evaluated for changes in dimension and strength. Their general condition was found to be excellent. 1970 SA E Transactions 700486. The Long Term Mechanical Behavior of Coupled Glass Reinforced Polypropylene. Lawrence C. Cessna, Hercules Inc. Mechanical property information is presented for the composite system, chopped glass fibers plus poly- propylene matrix, where effective fiber to matrix adhesion has been achieved. The data presented were developed to serve three major purposes; to establish coupled glass reinforced polypropylene (coupled GRPP) as a material of a different class than conventional GRPP, to provide long term data (creep and stress relaxation) for coupled GRPP which might form the basis for engineering design, and to illustrate the effects of such process related factors as coupling, glass fiber concentration, fiber length, and fiber orientation on the structural properties of coupled GRPP systems. 1970 SA E Transactions 700487. Observations on the Variability of Spark-Ignition Combustion Using a Single-Cycle Simulator. W. J. D. Annand and I. G. S. Summers, University of Manchester. The performance and economy of spark ignition engines are, as is well known, adversely affected by the variation in the course of combustion from cycle to cycle, which always occurs to a greater or less extent. In the past decade or so, several investigations of the combustion variation have been made. All these investigations, although differing in detail, have been made on running engines and therefore share certain difficulties in the separation of variables in an interpretation. This paper describes a new experimental approach, using a 1 cycle rig that simulates induction, compression, and combustion phases in a spark ignition engine. Results obtained from it to date are also presented and discussed. 700488. Cycle-by-Cycle Variations of a Spark Ignition Engine - A Statistical Analysis. R. K. Barton, D. K. Kenemuth, S. S. Lestz and W. E. Meyer, The Pennsylvania State University. The cycle-by-cycle combustion variation as reflected by the pressure development of a single cylinder, spark ignition, internal combustion engine are discussed. The data originated from a CFR-RDH engine which was instrumented with a pressure transducer whose signal was modified and digitized for statistical analysis of peak pressure, peak rate of pressure change, and crank angles at which peak pressure and peak rate of pressure changes occurred. These parameters were analyzed for averages, standard deviations, and cross-correlations. In addition, auto-correlations were made of peak pressure. A study &lt; was conducted on the effects of charge homogeneity using &lt; the F-test and Bartletťs test was used to determine if significant changes in the standard deviations occurred with changes in engine conditions. The results indicate that significant differences in the standard deviations of the four pressure development parameters exist for different engine operating conditions. Suggested variations in the combustion process are then inferred from these significant differences. The inferences made are with respect to the average flame speed, the variations in flame speed and the phasing of the combus- tion process. While it is shown how engine operating variables affect cycle-by-cycle variations, evidence is also presented to establish that these variations are random. 700489. Unraveling the Chemical Phenomena Occurring in Spark Ignition Engines. J. B. Edwards and D. Maxwell Teague, Chrysler Corp. The principles of combustion in a spark ignition engine are discussed. Engine processes and reactions are ex- plained as to the manner in which they influence exhaust composition. The subject is approached by considering how chemical phenomena interact in a complex system such as a spark ignition engine. Special attention is given to the effect on exhaust composition of such factors as engine design and modifications, fuel composition, and engine maintenance. 1970 SA E Transactions 700490. Combustion Knock in Pre-Chamber Diesels. R. Burt and K. A. Troth, Shell Research Ltd., England. A study of the characteristics of combustion knock in a 1 cyl pre-chamber diesel engine is reported here. The intensity of the knock showed pronounced cyclic disper- sion and an electronic counting technique was developed to measure the intensity distribution. The knock has a major frequency of 2370 Hz and was most apparent at low speeds. Advancing fuel injection timing and also increas- ing rate of fuel injection increased intensity. Tests with a wide range of fuel showed that cetane number was the only fuel property important to knock. A study of the relationship between knock intensity and the pattern of combustion pressure development showed that the time origin of knock was at or near the position of maximum rate of pressure rise, and that knock intensity could be related to a time function of pressure rise. 700491. A Combustion Chamber Designed for Minimum Engine Exhaust Emissions. H. K. Newhall and I. A. El Messiri, The University of Wisconsin. Experimental work has demonstrated that spark ignition engine exhaust emissions can be controlled through basic modification of the combustion process, and that such control can be achieved without serious compromise of the efficiency of fuel utilization. The combustion process investigated in this work is designed to exploit the finite time dependence of nitric oxide formation in high temperature combustion prod- ucts. Through use of a divided combustion chamber it has 147</page><page sequence="73">700493-700499 148 been possible to quench nitric oxide formation reactions so that little nitric oxide formation occurs. Further it has been possible to simultaneously promote complete ox- idation of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in com- bustion products. The combustion process, therefore, results in total control of exhaust emissions. Discussion: R. F. Stebar and ; W. A. Daniel, Res.

Yamakawa and H. Hayakawa, Tsukasa-Sokken Ltd. To analyze the behavior of fuel flow in a transient operation of a gasoline engine, the authors have developed a flowmeter based on a new hot-wire principle to measure the flow rate of pulsating fuel passing through a carbu- retor or an injection fuel tube. The device, which consists of twin wires mounted in a tandem arrangement, not only judges the direction of flow but also introduces no significant disturbance. Furthermore, this probe shows a response quick enough to permit measuring the pulsating fuel flow. This paper outlines the device along with a few applications. Discussion: Charles E.

The wide interest in the development of diagnostic techniques for automotive purposes has led to devel- opments in several areas. These include sensing methods, signal processing methods, and studies of how mechanical systems fail. This paper, concerned with only the first of these categories, presents an overview of sensors with emphasis on new developments that may be useful in the diagnostic field. Among the parameters which may be measured in automotive diagnostic systems are pressures, speeds, flow rates, temperatures, vibration, and electrical measurements. This paper will discuss various methods by which such parameters can be measured. 700496. Mechanical Basis for Pattern Analysis. John L. Frarey, Mechanical Technology Inc. Two basic approaches to pattern analysis as related to engine diagnostics may be recognized; a statistical- oriented approach that recognizes data patterns and relates them to known conditions previously observed; and a mechanically-oriented appraoch that seeks through an understanding of symptom-fault relationships to predict data patterns. This paper deals with the prereq- uisites for employing the mechanical approach. Cases involving turbine engine gas path analysis, vibration analysis, and piston scuffing detection are examined with regard to these prerequisites. 700497. Pattern Recognition Techniques Applied to Di- agnostics. E. Cortina and H. L. Engel, The Bissett-Berman Corp.; and W. K. Scott, U. S. Army Tank- Automotive Command. The application of Bayes' Procedures to effect statistically optimum diagnostic decisions is described. The thesis is advanced that pattern recognition techniques can be used to reduce processing complexity and thus permit imple- mentation of Bayes' Procedures in practical field portable equipment. This thesis is under evaluation in a test program in which journal bearing and wrist pin defects are detected from vibration measurements. Processing of vibration data by a computer programmed Pattern Recognition Technique resulted in design of "predetection" filters which can simplify the equipment required to detect the faults in real time. 700498. Advanced Manufacturing Developments in U.S.S.R. J. J. DiPonio, Ford Motor Co. The manufacturing engineering profession, and it is a profession in this country, is doing an excellent job of automating manufacturing processes so that more con- sumer goods can be produced at lower cost and better quality. The one area still untapped for major cost savings is the area of material usage. Chips represent waste, not only in material, but in added disposal cost and they create a poor environment for our people to work in. More progress is being made today in the area of making chips larger and faster and I hope that what you read and see in this simple presentation will inspire the manufacturing engineers to ask the question, "Why make chips at all?" The processes that follow were viewed in production during an extensive trip to Moscow, Kiev, Dne- propetrovsk and Konotop, in the Soviet Union. 1970 SA E Transactions 700499. A New, Further Stabilized Strain Gage Type Low Pressure Engine Indicator, Development and Analysis. Shin Matsuoka and Hidenori Tasaka, Tokyo Institute of Technology.; and Yoshiro Nojiri, Kyowa Dengyo Co. Ltd. A low-pressure indicator incorporating high stability, high sensitivity to the required pressure, and nonsensitivity to engine vibration has been developed. This new indicator employs a peripherally fixed strain-generating disk and a wavy cone type of diaphragm, which is insulated from the outer body by a silicone O-ring. The generated strain was detected by a strain gage that had high compensating performance for the temperature. Analytical study was made to get the optimum design for disk thickness, diameter, and additional vibrating mass. The combination of this analytical study and the development of several new devices made possible the incorporation of various innovations in this newly developed low-pressure indi-</page><page sequence="74">700500-700506 cator which was designed to obtain data that would augment present methods of engine analysis. 1970 SA E Transactions 700500. Investigation of Combustion Phenomena in a Swirl Chamber Compression Ignition Engine Using Schlieren Techniques. A. B. Allan and A. Khin, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., University of Toronto. Investigation of combustion phenomena in a swirl chamber compression-ignition engine was carried out using Schlieren techniques. An experimental swirl cham- ber was fabricated to fit into a conventional CFR-ASTM F-2 engine. The Schlieren image of the test zone was recorded by a "Hycam" camera at a framing rate of 15,000 frames/sec with an exposure/frame of 27jasec. The swirl chamber was also instrumented with a piezoelectric pressure transducer, and the chamber pressure was monitored on an oscilloscope screen. The pressure trace was photographed simultaneously on the reverse side of the cine film adjacent to the Schlieren image, displaying an excellent correlation between the structure of flame, and pressure rise in the swirl chamber. Significant engine operating parameters, such as speed, injection advance, and fuel-air ratio, were varied to study their effects on the nature of combustion in the swirl chamber. The present investigation has clearly shown in detail not available previously the distinct phases involved in the injection, evaporation, and mixing of the fuel with air. The extent of fuel penetration in relation to local swirl velocity was well demonstrated. Combustion was initiated at a very localized area of the swirl chamber. The investigation allowed the time of ignition and the zone of flame initiation to be determined precisely. 1970 SA E Transactions 700501. Correlation of Convective Heat Transfer for Steady Intake-Flow Through a Poppet Valve. Grunde T. Engh, Research Labs., General Motors Corp.; and Chung Chiang, Michigan Technological University. A simulated I.C. engine intake system composed of intake port, intake valve, and cylinder was used to obtain intake port heat transfer information. The effect of air direction and valve lift on the heat transfer from the hot intake valve to intake air was determined. It was found that a higher rate of heat transfer occurred at the same rate of flow, for a smaller inclination angle. Decreased valve lift was also found to yield a higher rate of heat transfer for the same flow. 700502. The Ignition Delay and Combustion of a Drop Under Pressure on a Hot Surface. R. W. Temple-Pediani, Borough Polytechnic. The ignition delay, combustion time, and smoke from a single drop of fuel on a hot surface were studied at various pressures up to 69 atm. The experimental results were correlated with previous data for drop evaporation on a hot surface, thereby yielding evidence that physical factors, in particular the rate of evaporation and con- sequent mixture formation, strongly influence the ignition delay and combustion of a drop. It is also shown that the magnitude of the critical temperature and pressure of a liquid fuel plays a sigificant role in all aspects of its combustion. A mechanism of ignition is proposed which con- tributes to better understanding of ignition delay phe- nomena. 700504. The 1970 Ford Dual Circuit Air Brake System. Richard W. Hildebrandt, Ford Motor Co. The braking system presented in this article represents a new and forward thinking philosophy regarding com- mercial vehicle air brake systems: a concept that provides responsive service and emergency brake applications with optimum vehicle control by the same driver action on the brake pedal. The uniqueness of the total system, and each circuit's function therof, is explained in basic detail. In addition, the engineering, quality control, and assembly techniques to manufacture the vehicle with assurance that design intent is achieved, is discussed. 1970 SA E Transactions 700505.

A new dual circuit brake system for increased safety and controllability of heavy duty vehicles is discussed. Through the common foot application valve, the driver has complete braking control during either normal or emergency conditions. Achievement of design objectives is explained via system and component function under various modes of operation. Reliability is vital to a brake system and assuring a high level of component product quality is achieved by; automated production testing, and periodic validation of compliance with engineering spec- ifications. 1970 SA E Transactions 700506. Engine Oil Thickening in High-Speed Passenger Car Service. N. E. Gallopoulos, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. Excessive engine oil thickening has occurred in some cars during the past two years. Apparently, this thickening was caused by prolonged exposure of the oil to high temper- atures. Temperatures have been generally increasing in recent years because motorists are generally driving faster, and higher loads imposed by trailers and air conditioners are more common. The high-speed track test reported in this paper showed that oil oxidation and nitration cause thickening, but antioxidants control it; thickening is not necessarily accompanied by heavy sludge and varnish deposits, and it occurs more readily in some cars. To diminish the occurrence of thickening, higher quality oils are needed. Discussion: R. J. McConnell, Ford Motor Co.; W.

An Engine-Dynamometer Test Procedure for Evaluating Oil Thickening Characteristics. R. H. Kabel, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. A proposed test procedure, Sequence IIC, has been developed to evaluate the thickening characteristics of engine oils. Results from the new 64 hr test procedure correlate well with the oxidative oil thickening observed in service vehicles and test cars. Sequence UIC also evaluates the sludge and varnish tendencies as well as the wear protection provided by an engine oil. Sequence UIC is intended to eventually replace the 58 hr Sequence HIB test. Only minor changes in engine components and auxiliary equipment are required to convert a test installation from Sequences IIB-IIIB to Sequences IIB or UIC. Discussion: R. J.

Motor Oil Thickening - A CLR Engine Test Procedure Which Correlates With Field Service. D. C. Bardy and P. A. Asseff, The Lubrizol Corp. Information relative to oil thickening has been developed in road tests. Typical operating temperatures as well as the length of time required to thicken oils in these tests are described. A laboratory test procedure has been de- veloped that shows a good degree of correlation with this field service. The effect of test conditions such as jacket temperature and piston ring design on oil thickening in the laboratory are described in the paper. Discussion: R. J. McConnell, Ford Motor Co. 1970 SAE Transactions 700509. Three Aspects of Motor Oil Thickening. W. C. Edmisten, J. V. Peterson and R. A. Sholts, Amoco Chemicals Corp. Recent trends in engine design and automotive service have led to increased engine oil temperatures and, as a result, to occasional reports of excessive oil thickening in service. The thickened oils are usually very highly oxidized. Laboratory engine and bench tests have been de- veloped to evaluate three parameters which affect oil thickening. The role of chemical inhibitors, base-oil volatility, and moderate temperature service were eval- uated. Chemical inhibitors were effective in controlling excessive oxidation, but significant thickening may occur because of base oil volatilization. Prolonged service at moderate temperatures depleted the ability of an oil to resist excessive oxidation at high temperatures. 700510. The ABC's of Motor Oil Qxidation. L. J. Allman, A. E. Brehm and C. C. Colyer, American Oil Co. Engine design and operational changes have led to increased motor oil temperatures. High oil temperatures have resulted in scattered instances of excessive motor oil viscosity increase in service. In the most severe oil thickening cases the oil would not flow, which caused engine failure. Trends in engine design including the incorporation of additional emission control devices, are expected to aggravate this potential problem further. A laboratory engine test technique has been developed which evaluates the performance of motor oils under high temperature operation. This technique was used to differentiate the various compositional parameters af- fecting oil oxidation and subsequent oil thickening. Insoluble oxidation products were responsible for most of the viscosity increase. The choice of blending stocks was signigicant to the stability. The influence of additives was minor. 700511. Measurement of Engine Oil Thickening. R. E. Paggi and R. E. Andrus, Texaco Inc. A laboratory engine test technique has been developed to stress motor oils such that their relative high-temperature thickening characteristics in severe service can be pre- dicted in a reliable manner. Engine mechanical condition, operating environment, and motor oil composition are important parameters affecting the thickening phenom- enon. The mechanisms of oil thickening are complex and may involve nitrogen fixation or soap formation as well as bulk oxidation. 700512. Brake System Performance at Low Operating Pressures. Robert J. Morse, Bendix- Westing- house Automotive Air Brake Co. The role of air brake system pneumatic pressure and time differentials in total vehicle brake system performance is discussed. The magnitude of pressure differentials for typical air brake system valves is shown and the signif- icance of both ascending and descending differential discussed. Transmission times for typical combination vehicles are shown and the effect of both pressure and time differentials at various axles on the proportioning of brake system work is developed. A number of means to deliberately unbalance pneumatic systems to compensate for unbalance in other components and thereby achieve better total brake system balance are discussed. 700513. Foundation Air Brake Performance at Low Operating Pressures. R. R. Svenson, North American Rockwell Corp. Truck Air Brake Performance at low operating pressures is important to the owner because it represents the service range representative of the greatest amount of use. This paper presents the factors involved and the results to be expected from the most commonly used brakes on line haul trucks in current use. Included are representative input-output curves of the brakes. From a safety standpoint maximum performance at rated load is of paramount importance but service life is determined by balance at low operating pressures.</page><page sequence="76">700514-700520 700514. Vehicle Brake Performance Evaluation. James E. Nelson, Consolidated Freightways. An effort was made to evaluate accurately truck air brake performance balance at low application pressures by means of comparing drum temperatures. This procedure produced excellent results, and is a fast, practical method for evaluating brake performance of combination vehicles. The drum, hub, and wheel assemblies used in this evaluation were all the same type and weight. The s-cam used was a 16 1/2 X 7 in. and the wedge was 15 X 7 in. Mixed combinations of these types were tested. It was found that s-cam brakes are more effective when used on drive axles than when used on trailing axles. A tractor protection valve with a built-in pressure increase of 33% to the trailer brakes was installed to compensate for the more effective drive axle brakes and this provided the desired braking balance. 700515. Highway Vehicle Stability in Braking Maneuvers. Bohyun Yim, Georbe R. Olsson and Peter G. Fielding, Booz, Allen Applied Research, Inc.; and Glenn G. Balmer, Bureau of Public Roads. The dynamic equations for an automobile in braking maneuvers are simplified in two steps. First, a nominal rectilinear trajectory is considered, with a constant deceleration rate. Secondly, a small perturbation in side-slip angle is examined, and linearized equations of motion are derived. Solutions are obtained in terms of Bessel functions. The vehicle response is deemed stable when initial perturbations to the nominal trajectory are damped, and the perturbed motion is oscillatory. Alge- braic expressions for the stability criteria are derived, illustrating the effects of speed, road friction, tire slip ratio, and vehicle design characteristics on vehicle re- sponse in braking maneuvers. 1970 SA E Transactions 700516. Applicability of Braking Control Systems for Highway Vehicles. George R. Olsson and Peter G. Fielding, Booz, Allen Applied Research, Inc.; and Glenn G. Balmer, Bureau of Public Roads. An evaluation of the applicability of braking control systems for highway vehicles was carried out. Elements of the study included development of a theory of vehicle response in braking maneuvers, design of logic for a braking control system, incorporation of the control in a hybrid computer simulation of a motor vehicle, and evaluation of control system performance. Benefits of braking control systems are illustrated in terms of improvement in stability characteristics (rear-wheel con- trol) and in directional control (four-wheel system). 700517. Friction Material Testing. R. M. Rusnak, F. W. Aldrich and W. M. Spurgeon, The Bendix Corp. Brake linings and pads are among the most critical components in an automobile and therefore testing to determine their properties and performance is of great importance. The types of tests employed are described and the purpose of each is discussed. Functional testing is performed on either dynamometers or vehicles. Char- acteristics of the dynamometer and vehicle are discussed as well as the correlation between results obtained from each, and current state-of-the-art in friction material testing is reviewed. Areas of possible future significant advancement exist in better correlation of vehicle and dynamometer results and development of a research dynamometer. 1970 SA E Transactions 700518. What is Truck Air Conditioning? E. J. Borowiec and W. D. Lee, Kysor Industrial Corp. The purpose of this paper is to define the meaning of truck air conditioning, to acquaint the various truck users with the historical development of truck air conditioning, to dwell briefly on basic system operation, and to make a cursory comparison of automobile and truck air con- ditioning system requirements. These requirements in- clude structural durability, reduced weight, and ease of serviceability. 700519. Preoperation, Scheduled and Special Mainte- nance for Truck Cab Air Conditioners. J. J. Way good and R. M. Varga, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. Many truck cab air conditioning failures are inadvertantly caused be service personnel, who fail to provide and maintain an optimum volume and status (contamination) of the system charge. There are some procedures recom- mended by truck cab air conditioning manufacturers, which can be incorporated by truck owners and operators to increase the effective life of an air conditioning system. If followed, these procedures can cut operating expenses by reducing premature component failure and reducing "down time." The key to obtaining optimum TCAC performance is to "triple evacuate" the system and "charge by weight." Discussion: T. B. Mannix, Ryder System.; and Paul T.

Payne, Eaton Yale &amp; Towne Inc. The function of component parts of a typical truck evaporator are defined. These include evaporator coil, expansion valve, temperature control, blower, and air distribution system. The various heat inputs to the truck cab depend on engine cover temperature, type of insu- lation, air infiltration at various road speeds, number of cab occupants, etc. Outside air temperature is the greatest contributor to the heat which must be absorbed by the evaporator. In designing evaporators, space available in the cab must be considered so that the location of air discharge is most beneficial to occupants. The repair mechanic should be sufficiently trained to 151</page><page sequence="77">700521-700527 152 have a better understanding of the fundamentals of the system. With proper instructions to the truck operator and a scheduled preventive maintenance program, field repair problems should be alleviated. 700521. Diesel Fuel Specifications and Their Current Suitability. Gilbert K. Brower, International Harvester Co. Diesel fuel specifications have undergone major revisions during the past decade. Actions taken to date do not satisfy the expressed requirements of the majority of diesel engine users and engine builders. Reference is made to the compatibility of current diesel fuel specifications with other middle distillate fuel specifications. Premium diesel fuels and fuel additives are discussed. Constructive diesel fuel specification revisions are proposed which should satisfy the current needs of all diesel fuel consumers and diesel engine builders and still be acceptable to the refiners and marketers of diesel and other related middle distillate fuels. 700522. Diesel Fuel Specification and Smoke Suppressant Additive Evaluations. J. G. Brandes, Detroit Diesel Engine Co., General Motors Corp. There are numerous federal, military, and commercial diesel fuel specifications used by industry as guidelines for selection. Detroit Diesel Engine Div. divides the popular fuel specifications into four categories for the purpose of using terms and values of reference. These are CITE, jet-turbine, light, and heavy grade fuels. DDED manufactures engines to operate on fuels classified as grades 1-D and 2-D of ASTM designation D-075, and publishes a fuel oil selection chart in which fuels defined for specific service applications are indi- cated. Final boiling point, sulfur content, and cetane number limits are specified to assure fuel uniformity and satisfactory performance. The performance of barium containing smoke sup- pressant diesel fuel additives in dynamometer engines under sustained and cyclic operating conditions was investigated. The ash deposits obtained using additive treated fuel were relatively heavy compared to the levels obtained using untreated fuel. 700525. Aberdeen Proving Ground Facilities for Testing Military Vehicles. William A. Gross, Jr., U.S. Army Materiel Command. Tests conducted at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds to evaluate performance and reliability requirements for military vehicles, weapons, equipment, and systems are presented in detail. Conducted by the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command, the tests include field performance tests, engineering tests to make specific measurement of vehicle performance either in field types of natural environment or in simulated environments under labo- ratory-controlled conditions, durability tests, and weapon systems tests. 700524. The Highway Research Laboratory of Ohio's Transportation Research Center. Johannes F. Schwar and Jeffrey A. Myers, Ohio State University. This paper presents some of the technical considerations that underlie the development of the master plan and the establishment of design specifications for Ohio's Highway Research Laboratory. It describes the overall features of the master plan and discusses some of the critical design features as these relate to the various tracks and other field facilities. The development of the master plan was guided by a study of the layout of existing proving grounds and by the experience gained over the years in their operations. It was guided furthermore by a set of principles relating to operational considerations, considerations of flexibility in the layout, land utilization, safety, capacity, and cost. Finally, it was guided by an indication of future research and development needs as expressed by researchers and potential sponsors in both government and industry. Similar guidelines were followed in the establishment of overall design specifications for the various tracks, field structures, and buildings. Design specifications related to the geometry, structural features, and safety were con- sidered as being of prime importance, while specifications for operational controls, data collection and transmission systems, and provision of utilities were considered as being of secondary importance. 700525. Development of Engine Structural Integrity Through Use of Stress Analysis. E. J. Ash, Chrysler Corp. Once a new engine is designed, it is subjected to extensive development programs prior to manufacture in produc- tion volumes. Many in-vehicle and engine dynamometer tests are required to integrate a reliable powerplant into a commercial vehicle. Development engines are limited in number and built of premium cost experimental parts. To prevent the failure of development engines, adequate strength of all structural components is necessary early in the development program. This paper examines how experimental stress analysis was used in assuring adequate strength of the new Chrysler 245 cu in. 6 cyl engine. 700526. Crankshaft Strength Through Laboratory Test- ing. E. J. Jensen, Chrysler Corp. This paper discusses laboratory procedures that have proven successful in analyzing crankshaft strength. Ex- perimental techniques provide the most accurate means of determining the two variables required for this analysis, operating loads and fatigue strength. Comparison of these variables supplies the data to determine minimum factors of safety for each operating condition. Inadequate values indicate the need for crankshaft redesign. 700527.

Prévost, General Motors Proving Ground.</page><page sequence="78">700528-700535 Systems and techniques for conducting crash tests have been under study for a long period of time. Those now used by GM have been refined to the point where: test parameters (speed, point of impact, etc.) are repeatable, and the acquisition of dynamic data is assured. This paper will describe GM's facility. Discussion will center on the function and performance of systems and techniques such as: total test control, method of test vehicle towing, control and determination of impact speed, electronic and photographic data acquisition, test abort, and provisions for personnel safety. 1970 SA E Transactions 700528. Anomalous Fractures of Diesel Engine Bearing Cap Bolts. G. H. Walter, R. M. Hendrickson and R. D. Zipp, International Harvester Co. This report describes the nature of unusual bearing cap bolt fractures that occurred in heavy-duty industrial diesel engines. Electron fractographic examination provided the key element in the analysis of the fracture mechanism. Spontaneous rupture of the high-strength alloy steel bolts occurred as a result of stress-corrosion cracking. The aggressive environment necessary to develop this type of fracture was identified as moist H2S. It was found that H2S was released from the engine oil additive, zinc dithiophosphate, and the necessary moisture was intro- duced during removal of the caps for bearing inspection after engine "run-in." The development of these fractures required the occurrence of several events which accounts for their rarity. 700530. Boat Design, with Comments on the Recreational Boating Industry. David D. Beach, Boating Industry Association. Recreational boating is discussed in this paper. Some historical background is presented, and then the growth of the industry is traced over the past 30 years. Emphasis is placed on boat materials and engines. Design of recreational boats is treated in greater detail, with examples of various shape boats being given. Some mathematical discussion is also included. 700531. Mixed and Radial Flow Compressors - Discussion of Methods for Desigit Improvements. Sven-Olof Kronogard, Technical University of Lund. This paper presents a simplified method for deriving the parameters necessary for the design and development of compressors for automotive gas turbines, turbochargers, etc. Much of the theory and experimental data have been extracted from existing reports of studies and investi- gations, but a fair amount of practical design work and experimental evidence is offered to confirm theoretical applications. 1970 SA E Transactions 700532. Mileage Marathon® from 50 to 244 mpg. D. C. Carlson and H. D. Millay, Shell Oil Co. In 1939, the first Mileage Marathon was conducted by the employees of the Shell Oil Co. Research Laboratory at Wood River. Since that time, 22 Marathon competitions have been held under the sponsorship of the Laboratory recreational organization. All preparation and competi- tion has been the result of individual effort on the part of the participants. This report presents a brief history of the Marathon, including rules, method of scoring, and results. However, the major portion is devoted to a discussion of the steps taken to establish the current record of 244.35 mpg with a 1959 Fiat 600. 700533. (SP-359) Match the Engine Intake System to the Application and Environment. David W. Morton, Donaldson Co. Inc. Engine air intake systems for construction, agricultural, and over-highway vehicles must remove a wide variety of contaminants. Good selection of components for the intake system depends on matching performance char- acteristics of the air cleaner and accessories to the expected types and concentrations of contaminants. Actual field dust concentrations, and the relationship between field and laboratory service life, are plotted for two-stage dry air cleaners in off-highway applications. These data along with a summary of the major factors to consider in selection and layout of components will aid in designing engine air intake systems. 700534. (SP-359) The Turbocharger - A Vital Part of the Engine Intake and Exhaust Systems. William E. Woollenweber, Schwitzer Div., Wallace-Murray Corp. The turbocharger is a component common to both the intake and exhaust systems of internal combustion engines. The manner in which it is applied can have a major effect on the performance and durability of the engine, as well as influence the size and selection of other components in the system. A well matched engine-turbocharger combination can be relatively insensitive to changes in environmental temperature and pressure, whereas a poorly matched combination may suffer extreme losses in performance and life. Some of the more important factors in matching a turbocharger to an engine are discussed with emphasis on how development of the turbocharger characteristics has contributed to the highly satisfactory performance being obtained from turbocharged engines today. 700535. (SP-359) The Influence of Induction and Exhaust System Design on Power Producing Character- istics of Diesel Engines. Harold G. Holler, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Engine power production is proportional to weight of air trapped in the combustion chamber. This paper discusses how, inlet system restriction, inlet air temperature, and exhaust back pressure influence engine performance. A family of four-cycle diesel engines from the naturally aspirated (90 bmep) to the turbocharged-aftercooled (220 153</page><page sequence="79">700536-700540 154 bmep) is studied. System limitations are established and future trends in engine design are discussed. Discussion: O. A. Uyehara and P. S. Myers, University of Wisconsin; Author's closure 1970 SA E Transactions 700536. (SP-359) Tur bochar ger Aftercooling - Why and How. Calvin J. King, Perfex Corp. Three types of water-cooled aftercoolers are now in use - the box type, the plug-in bundle type, and the in-head type. For stationary applications the box types are favored, while the in-head type is favored on vehicular applications because of its compactness. The in-head type aftercoolers, through improvements in specific heat transfer performance, are on the uptrend. Further devel- opments of air-to-air coolers, permitting lower intake manifold temperatures because of the lower temperature heat sink, are expected. 700537. (SP-359) Muffler Selection and Design for In- ternal Combustion Engines. Dean G. Thomas, Nelson Muffler Corp. In the selection of a muffler for the reduction of the exhaust noise of an internal combustion engine the acoustical problems are only one of many. Attention must also be given to problems of space availability and configuration. It is important that the best material for the purpose is chosen. Equally important is the most eco- nomic utilization of this material both from the standpoint of original cost and availability as well as the practical aspect of ease of production. Not only basic acoustical design but some of the problems of fabrication and attachment are discussed. Special mufflers, including catalytic afterburners, are discussed in detail. 700538. (SP-360) The Effect of Casting Variables and Section Size on the Stress-Rupture Life of a High Temperature Nickel Base Alloy. Roger D. Lloyd, Avco Lycoming Div. A study was conducted to determine the effect of the many foundry variables, inherent in the investment casting industry, on the stress-rupture life of Lycoming alloy M3608-a representative state-of-the-art nickel base superalloy. Particular emphasis was placed on the roll of test specimen geometry and its relationship to cast turbine blade hardware. Trends are discussed in terms of rupture life, microstructure, and mocrodiscontinuities. Knowledge of the effect of casting parameters and component section size on rupture life will enable the designer and materials engineer to design and fabricate new hardware with greater assurance that it will do the job intended. 700539. (SP-360) Design Considerations in Selecting Alloys for Aircraft Structures. M. J. Rich, Sikorsky Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. The important factors in selecting alloys for aircraft structures are the useful specific strength of the material, resistance to corrosion, producibility, and cost. Because of the high worth of a pound in aircraft, the major design consideration becomes the strength factor. The useful strength of the material depends not only on the specific static and fatigue strength, but on the reliability required, as well as the ability of the material to resist damage. For reliability, the scatter or statistical strength distribution becomes an important design factor for both static and fatigue-loaded structures. For struc- tures subjected to fatigue loading, the dynamic stress- strain behavior of the material and the notch sensitivity are factors used in determining the useful strength. For compression-loaded structures, the important material properties are the yield condition and the stress-strain relationship beyond yield. The fail-safe design philosophy used in aircraft structures requires that the useful strength be limited by the fracture toughness and fatigue crack propagation rate of the material. For fail-safe structures, the damage tolerance is achieved by designing for residual strength and life. 700540. (SP-360) Directional Solidification to Produce Columnar Grain and Single Crystal Structures. Francis L. VerSnyder, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. Something exciting has been happening during these last several years. Structural components of a major engi- neering device were first constructed so that each one consisted of an individual metal crystal. These were alloy single crystal turbine blades for advanced aircraft jet engines. A new precision-casting technique, based on directional solidification, which imparts significantly improved ductility and thermal shock resistance to high-temperature, creep-resistant, nickel-base superalloys, has been carried through from research to production. This controlled solidification technique has been used to produce both columnar grain and alloy single crystal gas turbine components. The improvement in physical properties is achieved by controlling the solidification process to produce either columnar grains throughout a cast-to-size part, or a complete single crystal throughout a cast-to-size part, with a preferred [001] crystallographic orientation. This ori- entation is established parallel to the major stress axis of the part without the use of separate "seeding." These parts have exhibited superior structural strength and stability in the severe operating environments associated with gas turbine engine operation. A comparison is made between the properties of superalloys having conventional equiax- ed grains, directionally solidified columnar grains and [001] oriented single crystals. The evolution of this new process is traced from its beginning in columnar grain directional solidification experiments through the pilot-plant operation. The fea- sibility of producing parts using the "directional solidi- fication process" has been demonstrated in production foundry facilities where several thousand gas turbine</page><page sequence="80">700541-700556 blades and vanes have been cast-to-size in various complex shapes. 1970 SAE Transactions 700541. Engineer in Product Planning. James A. Capolongo, Ford Motor Co. This paper describes the organization of production planning activities at the Ford Motor Co. and relates them to engineering functions in various departments. The review is presented in three parts: the need for production planning, what comprises it, and the scope of its activity. The objective of the author is to demonstrate how coordination of nonengineering and engineering functions can effect a business-oriented operation of product projection. 700542. Product Planning An Engineer's Job. J. R. Doidge, General Motors Corp. The theme of this paper is that only an engineer is equipped by virtue of his training to perform an adequate production planning job. The author proves his point by reviewing the procedures adopted by General Motors Corp. and showing how the newly created Forward Planning staff has operated to combine the efforts of design, manufacturing, assembly, distribution, and service staffs. Engineers on this staff devote their planning efforts to two areas, forward planning and program planning. In the early stages of their studies, marketing advice is sought and styling counsel is solicited. From this point on the Forward Planning staff directs assembly of prototypes and manufacturing evaluations of tooling and facility requirements. 700550. Managing Change ... In You. W. R. Watson, Caterpillar Tractor Co. What we are given at birth, our genetic heritage, we have no choice but to accept. What we strive to be is within our conscious control and this determines both our character and the nature and direction of our development. This paper identifies and offers suggestions for meeting two of the greatest challenges in any program of self-improve- ment: establishing priorities and mapping out a plan. 700551. Air Pollution and Construction Equipment. R. D. Henderson, Caterpillar Tractor Co. The diesel is considered the predominant engine used in construction equipment. Smoke regulations, which are in effect or pending, are discussed to point out the industry is subject to controls. An estimate of the amount of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen emitted by earthmoving equipment is made to evaluate the air pollution which may be attributed to the industry. Substantial effort to reduce emissions is suggested. 700552. Coal and Clean Air. George W. Land, Ayrshire Coal Co. Today, the matter of air pollution control has become a compounding problem. There is a greater level of public interest now than in years past, with special concern directed as "what effects will air pollution have upon our lives," and "what can be done to reduce air pollution." Progressive pollution control can only be successful with society's efforts, guided by scientists and engineers, and with the cooperative backings of government and indus- try. 700553. The Application of Anthropometry to Automotive Design. Ronald W. Roe and Peter Kyropoulos, General Motors Corp. Anthropometry, the Measure of Man, is an old and well-established branch of anthropology. The present report deals with the identification and application of the pertinent dimension of the driving population and the use of these data in the design of the driver's workspace. The statistical nature of the information is emphasized. The devices used to gather data (anthropometers) and their statistical evaluation and analysis are discussed and illustrated. The concept and application of the SAE manikins and the driver's eye ellipses are presented. 1970 SAE Transactions 700554. Factors Affecting the Man/Machine Relationship on Earthmoving Equipment,. Jerome W. Hoeschen, U. S. Army Mobility Equipment Research &amp; Development Center. Man's use and control of energy is ever expanding and demanding new concepts and technology. One of the demands on construction equipment designers is that the operator be considered a "variable" component in the man/machine system. This paper deals with man's physical and psychological attributes along with machine characteristics that affect man and productivity. Guide- lines are laid down for assignment of functions to the man versus the machine and design rules are spelled out. Some new technological concepts for earthmoving are also discussed. 1970 SAE Transactions 700555. Basics of Structural Fatigue. K. N. Smith and T. H. Topper, University of Waterloo, Canada. Various recent developments in mechanics theory are discussed with reference to the design of mental structures for fatigue. Particular attention is given to the fatigue notch factor and some test results on welded components are presented and discussed in this context. Emphasis is placed on relating design procedures to progress in fatigue research. 700556. Fatigue Strength as a Design Criterion. J. G. Hicks, The Welding Institute. The major factor determining the fatigue life of a welded structure under a given loading is the configuration of the weldments. The selection of various steel types and welding processes are considered to be secondary influ- ences on the fatigue strength. It is possible to improve the fatigue strength of weldments by a number of practical 155</page><page sequence="81">700557-700563 156 techniques. Research in progress indicates that the fatigue behavior of weldments can be predicted by the application of fracture mechanics theory; it is hoped that this will lead to a clearer inderstanding of fatigue and the development of more refined techniques of fatigue life calculation. 700557. Adapting Material Data to Design. R. Bruce Hopkins, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works. In product design and development it is necessary to compare operating stresses to material strength properties in order to estimate the durability of the various components. The effects of material hardness, surface finish, section size, and presence of stress concentrations on the fatigue properties of steel, cast irons, sintered irons and steels, and aluminum are discussed. Because a material specification normally includes a range of strength properties, a method is suggested for constructing an estimated S-N curve based upon a selected strength level. The method is extended to construct an S-N curve for an approximate failure rate of the selected strength level. The construction of failure diagrams for irons and steels is discussed. Use of the true fracture strength instead of the ultimate tensile strength is suggested for construction of modified Goodman diagrams for ductile materials. 700558. Some Factors Influencing the Actual Life of Components and Structures. Manfred F. Naujoks, International Harvester Co. Theories can be used to explain the nature of different failures. However, they cannot account for all the unknown factors that may effect the reliable performance of an end product. Some factors the design engineer should consider are the effect of manufacturing processes, materials, and working environment, and their influence on the performance and reliability of the machine. 700559. Misalignment Problems in Cylindrical Roller Bearings. W. J. Derner, Rollway Bearing Co., Inc. In the application of cylindrical roller radial bearings where cumulative assembly tolerances or load deflection insure a signficant skewness between inner and outer race center lines, careful design, and manufacturing methods are required to provide reliable performance. In addition, when the composite problems become severe, lubrication and retainer design require extra attention. Arbitrary application of standard catalog bearings often leads to disappointing performance. Misalignment effects can be noted in shortened fatigue life, extreme wear rates, and excessive operating temperatures. To insure against these detrimental results, more extensive analytical design methods must be em- ployed and a more detailed understanding of the appli- cation must be developed. Though not always appreciated, cylindrical roller radial bearings are capable of running with significant misalignment and offer economical rewards to the manufacturer when the design is properly worked out. 700560. Relating Lubricant Film Thickness to Contact Fatigue. Charles H. Danner, The Timken Roller Bearing Co. Fatigue-life tests have been conducted on full-scale bearings and in contact-fatigue rigs simulating roller bearing contact. Results indicate fatigue life can be related to film thickness determined from elastohydrodynamic theory. Oil-film continuity studies and fatigue-life test in the contact fatigue rigs indicate frequency of peeling can be associated with percentage of metallic contact. Con- touring the specimens to obtain nearly uniform stress distribution simulating modified line contact in roller bearings was effective in decreasing the incidence of peeling and the measured metallic contact over a wide range of film thickness. The major disadvantage of the rig testing was the excessive amount of time required to obtain results comparable to the full-scale bearing-test results. 700561. Made in Japan. W. L. Hertenstein, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Japan has established an outstanding record of industrial growth and provided ample, modern facilities for con- tinuing this growth. She has proved her ability to produce quality merchandise and will continue to compete for world markets. American industry and the American worker must accept this reality and meet the challenge. This paper briefly outlines the growth in various Japanese industries since World War II, and pictures the devel- opment of her physical plant (manufacturing plants, highways, railroads). 700562. Moving the Machines that Move the Earth. M. J. Mackie, Parkhill Truck Co. A brief look at the problems faced by specialized carriers and manufacturers in the movement of overdimension and overweight machines. How the manufacturers can overcome many of the problems is through the initial design of the machine, and through a closer working relationship between the carriers and manufacturers. Accomplishing this will allow engineers to design and manufacture, and carriers to transport machines of the future, regardless of size and weight. 700563. The High- Wide Load - Another Railroad Oppor- tunity. R. C. Schoppert, Illinois Central Rail- road. Once large pieces of machinery, such as earthmoving equipment, have been manufactured, they must be shipped to the buyer. This paper discusses the operations of one railroad, the Illinois Central, in handling this problem. Due to route obstacles, the railroads classify loads into two categories: those under 10 ft 8 in. width and 15 ft 1 in. height, and those under 10 ft 8 in. width and 15 ft 6 in. height. Loads beyond these dimensions must be</page><page sequence="82">700564-700573 routed with care to avoid the obstacles creating these limits. The method used by IC is described. Weight limits are similarly outlined. 700564. Movement of Oversize and Overweight Vehicles and Loads in Illinois. W. A. Frick, Illinois Division of Highways. Special permits for the movement of equipment and objects are required if legal limitations of sizes and weights are exceeded. The purpose of this paper is to outline the legal limitations and procedures for obtaining special permits in the State of Illinois. The paper also provides information regarding the fees required for such permits and the conditions of operation which are directed for the movement of oversize or overweight loads. Considerations for equipment design, in view of the legal limitations of size and weight, are offered. 700565. Predicting Best Earthmoving Fleet Production Rate and Cost. M. K. Damali, Caterpillar Tractor Co. A technique is discussed which allows an estimator to calculate the fleet production rate of scrapers or trucks and include the effect of operator efficiency machine interference, and machine availability. The main purpose of this technique is to supplement the experience of the estimator and permit him to make quicker and more accurate appraisals of equipment utilization and re- quirements. 700566. Construction Simulation of the Main Earth Dam at Manicouagan 3. Serge Godbout and J. P. Frenois, Hydro-Quebec.; and A. G. Gra velie, Bélanger, Ouellette &amp; Associates. This paper describes the computer model developed to simulate construction of the eleven million cu yd gravel dam at Manic 3, and outlines the results obtained. Construction of the dam is a complex task influenced by many random events. Manic 3 is part of Hydro-Quebec's Manicouagan- Outardes hydroelectric development, which will ultimately comprise seven power stations with a combined capacity of 5.5 million kW. Before simulation was introduced, it was extremely difficult to solve the many problems involved in choosing and utilizing equipment, obtaining accurate time and cost estimates, and formulating realistic production schedules. 700567. Vehicle Mission Simulation. Peter W. Schutz, Donald A. Klokkenga and David B. Stattenfield, Cummins Engine Co. Vehiclp mission simulation is one component of a system designed to optimize selection and operation of on- highway vehicles. The focus of vehicle mission simulation is on equipment specification. It can predict the physical and financial performance of equipment alternatives, identify opportunities and correct problems before a truck is purchased. 700568. Automatic Central Hydraulic Systems for Front Loaders. Frank Ratliff, Tyrone Hydraulics, Inc. Controlling the cost of excavating and moving a yard of earth is the greatest challenge confronting the earth- moving industry today. This industry, in particular, faces both a shortage of skilled operators and an inflationary wage environment. To increase a skilled operator's efficiency and decrease learning time for new operators, the Tyrone Automatic Central Hydraulic System auto- matically directs the proper amount of hydraulic power at the proper time to the various functions of the front loader. Hydraulic valving coordinates pump flows for approximately constant lock-to-lock times throughout the cycle regardless of engine rpm and at the same time controls the interaction of the lift cylinder, bucket cylinder, and transmission disconnect for the fastest possible full bucket loading in both stockpile and virgin bank. 700569. Design and Application Considerations for Ele- vating Scraper Chains. Jack H. Thuerman, Rex Chainbelt, Inc. Elevator characteristics are discussed as they relate to chain performance, with emphasis on sprocket design and chain interaction. Factors which influence the rate of chain wear are reviewed, and an example is given for calculating chain wear life. Chain loading and the results of field load measurements using telemetry are discussed, with an example of calculating finite chain fatigue life. 1970 SA E Transactions 700570. Operation - Component Upgrade. J. E. Jass, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Improved components usually improve the reliability and availability for work of earthmoving machines. This paper discusses a number of components that must be improved to make the entire industry more profitable - the customer gaining reduction of unit cost per yard of earth moved and the manufacturer obtaining a higher selling cost in exchange for greater availability. The components covered are: cooling systems, fabrications, tires, engines, pin joints, hydraulic pumps, hydraulic system cleaning, hydraulic fluid containers, ground engaging tools, transmissions, cabs and air conditioners, transfer gear trains, gages and sensors, and oil seals. All of these components must be improved and made more reliable to cut the downtime of the user. 700573. (P-32) The Role of the Prior Distribution in Bayesian Decision Making for the Binomial Situation. R. R. Prairie, Sandia Labs.; and W. J. Zimmer, University of New Mexico. In reliability work, the Bayes approach is often used to obtain point and interval estimates on components and/or systems. The results of using inappropriate prior distri- butions with these Bayes techniques can be a misdirection of decisions or a decision which is less effective than a decision based on the corresponding classical technique. 157</page><page sequence="83">700574-700579 158 However, there is often prior information available which is relevant to the decision to be made and failure to take it into account may also lead to a misdirected decision. In addition, the choice of a prior distribution when no prior information is available cannot be made from an arbitrary "feeling" of objectivity and is just as important to consider as the choice of the proper prior when prior information is available. This paper investigates the role of the prior distribution in affecting decisions based on point and interval estimates of component and system reliability. The effectiveness and robustness of the Bayes techniques are discussed and the Bayes techniques are compared to the classical techniques in both a Bayes and classical framework. Some guidance is given on the choice of reasonable prior distributions. 700574. (P-32) On-Line (Console-Aided) Assessment of Prior Distributions for Reliability Problems. Chi-Yuan Lin and George J. Schick, University of Southern California. The quantification of a decision maker's judgments about uncertainty is a key step in Bayesian analysis of a decision problem. This paper is concerned with the use of an on-line computer system to assist a person in quantifying his judgements, with reference to reliability problems. A computer program is designed to display a questionnaire on a console, and to allow the user to interact with the computer during his course of quantification. This interactive feature provides an assistance for the user in removing inconsistencies of his responses to the ques- tionnaire . Furthermore, the responses to the question- naire are processed in real time to fit a smoothed cumulative distribution to facilitate the user's subsequent analysis. 700575. (P-32) A Routine Bayesian Assessment and Modification of Prediction. Trevor L. Salt, Gen- eral Electric Co. The author previously introduced an approach to the modification of mechanical component life predictions by utilization of Bayes Theorem in its discrete formulation. This paper shows how these previous ideas have been extended and developed into the production of a com- puter program BAMBI (Bayesian, Analysis Modified By Inspection) for the routine assessment and modification of belief. Three important problems and solutions are discussed in depth: 1. The introduction of experience from operational exposure when there had been either a very high or very low prior belief of success. 2. Determination of sample size limitations. 3. Concurrent evaluation of experience from different test times. It is concluded that a computer program such as BAMBI can be extremely useful for evaluating an original design intent in the light of subsequent test and field experience. Further, the availability of such a routine Bayesian analytical technique in Gas Turbine engine design provides one example of Assurance Technology spin-off. 700576. (P-32) On the Use of Prior Distributions in Acceptance Sampling. Robert G. Easterling, Sandia Labs. The use and interpretation of prior and posterior distri- butions in Bayesian analyses is discussed with particular reference to whether the prior represents personal prob- ability or the distribution of a random variable. One situation in which the latter applies is acceptance sampling, the parameter of interest varying from lot to lot. Two criteria for assessing or determining a sample plan, which incorporate the information represented by the prior distribution into the producer's and consumer's risks, are presented and illustrated. 700577. (P-32) A Risk Analysis Procedure for Calculating Failure Rates vs. Time. Dolph G. Ebeling, General Electric Co. This paper describes and illustrates a general method of reliability analysis that is based on the concepts of Bayesian subjective probability and is readily imple- mented using a set of stored, time-sharing computer programs. 700579. (P-32) Mariner '69 Testing and Flight Results. M. T. Goldfine, California Institute of Technology. Mariner 6 and Mariner 7 successfully completed every one of the missions' science and engineering objectives during their average 219,000,000 mile trip to and close fly-by of the planet Mars in 1969. Man's knowledge of the "red planet" has greatly increased with the Television, Infrared Spectrometer, Ultraviolet Spectrometer, Occul- tation and Celestrial mechanics data returned by both Mariners. The Mariner '69 was based on a design of its predecessors, had incorporated a significant increase in flexibility that made it much more difficult to test, but yet afforded the opportunity to overcome many problems in the ground test program and compensate for all problems experienced during flight. The Test and Operations Program experienced serious problems at the start, throughout, and during the final week of launch preparations. The test organization, test procedures, spacecraft test equipment, and the project support allowed these problems to be handled in a manner that permitted the spacecraft to meet the very inflexible launch opportunity. The Mariner '69 System Test and Operation Program was not perfect but effective. The major problem in conducting the program was mainly related to the relatively short period of allowable test time. All objec- tives of the test program were met although in some cases they were compromised. Most of the design and workmanship problems were solved during the ground testing. However, some prob-</page><page sequence="84">700580-700584 lems were uncovered in flight that were missed on the ground, but their effects were capable of being reduced because of the experience and knowledge gained during the ground test program, and because of the spacecraft design that provided the necessary flexibility to permit correction actions to be taken. 700580. (P-32) Skylab Test Program Management and Requirements. H. P. Wong, NASA Head- quarters.; and J. B. Meyer, General Electric Co. The Skylab Program is an extension of Manned Space Flight beyond the goals of the Apollo Program for earth orbital missions, utilizing hardware and technology from previous programs; that is, Appollo and Gemini. This paper contains a discussion of the Skylab Test Program management, policy, and requirements. The Skylab Test Program is designed to verify that hardware meets its performance/design requirements and mission objectives with the minimum expenditure of funds. This requires, at all hardware levels: 1. The timely identification of minimum, but ade- quate, test requirements through the systems engineering approach. 2. The determination of actual versus planned test status. 3. Management visibility and control to assure that test requirements are being met in a most effective and economical manner. This paper describes these management techniques and some of the significant policy and requirements identified in NHB 8080.3, Apollo Applications Test Requirements (AATR), currently being used in the Skylab Test Program. It also identifies additional management displays and techniques currently utilized to a varying degree within the Skylab Program. 700581. (P-32) All- Weather Automatic Landing System Development and Testing. D. R. Clifford, The Boeing Co. The performance of automatic landing systems in use in jet transport aircraft today is degraded by variations in the ground radio guidance signals. These variations are mainly due to multipath effects and tend to inhibit routing coupled approach to touchdown especially in reduced visibility. Autoland control employing inertial smoothing can compensate for ground beam anomalies including fail- ures. This paper summarizes the testing done to date on such a system in the Boeing jet transport prototype. 700582. (P-32) Verification Testing of the 1970 Anti-Theft Steering Column. J. Forgione, Ford Motor Co. This paper outlines the key elements in a laboratory reliability verification test program for an automotive subsystem. Many of these elements are described in some detail through the various stages of development from prototype concept to production. By means of an actual case study, verification testing of the 1970 Ford Anti- Theft Steering Column, steps required to design tests which yield meaningful information and the rationale used to analyze the results are presented. The steering column on a late model automobile is a complex system which combines several functions and features; steering, shifting, warning devices (turn signal and emergency flashers), ignition switch, anti-theft devices plus several safety features. The effectiveness of the overall verifi- cation program is evaluated through the presentation of actual field-feedback results. 700583. (P-32) Test and Checkout Procedures for the Tektite Ocean Habitat System. John B. Tenney, Jr. and D. J. Withey, General Electric Co. This paper describes test and checkout procedures for the Tektite ocean habitat system. The Tektite ocean habitat system is an underwater laboratory designed to support scientific and technical crews performing long term, shallow water diving experiments. In 1969, this system housed four aquanaut/scientists for a period of 60 days at a depth of 50 feet. The original experiment, sponsored by the Navy, verified the feasibility of the habitat as in-situ marine scientific laboratory and demonstrated its ade- quacy as a life support system. In April 1970, the habitat began a program under the sponsorship of the Depart- ment of the Interior to support several five man teams, each performing two week scientific missions over a seven month time period. Testing and checkout of the habitat and its related systems, life support, power, communications, and water, involves activity both above and below the surface. First, the systems must be tested by engineers and technicians before the habitat is emplaced in the water. This insures that the habitat is in a ready condition, and verifies the ability of the systems to meet performance requirements. Finally, many systems checks must be performed in the water after emplacement. Because divers are limited by the time they are permitted to remain at depth, these tests must be carefully designed and rehearsed to permit completion within prescribed time limits. The key to success under such conditions lies in careful test planning and scheduling, advance testing of equipment and materials, and utilization of diver trained engineers and technicians who are thoroughly trained on all systems. 700584. (P-32) Interpretation of Test Data by Design Margin Techniques. H. Hecht, Aerospace Corp. The design margin technique is applied to the evaluation of poststorage reliability of nine high quality gyro assemblies. Compared to standard reliability evaluation based on attribute tests (pass-fail), the technique is shown to yield more sensitive measures of reliability and narrower confidence intervals for a given sample size. Advantages of the design margin technique in measuring performance degradation during storage and in permitting experience on an existing design to be applied to the development of an improved model are pointed out. 159</page><page sequence="85">700586-700590 160 700586. (P-32) S-65-200 Commercial Compound Aircraft Design for Maintenance. Angelo C. Veca, Sikorsky Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. In the design of the S-65-200 commercial compound aircraft - a 230 knot, 86 passenger transport - maximum consideration was given to meeting a high dispatch reliability goal and to ease of performing maintenance. This paper describes how maintenance and reliability of this compound helicopter is enhanced by use of new and improved technology. 700587. (P-32) Design of Helicopter Transmission for On-Condition Maintenance. D. G. Harding and J. C. Mack, Vertol Div., The Boeing Co. This paper considers the reduction of helicopter "cost of ownership" by the process of reducing the frequency of transmission overhaul. Reasons for time scheduled over- hauls (TBO) and their validity to helicopter transmissions are explored. Failure functions for several transmissions are shown and individual failure modes explored for indications of failure function trends beyond the current operating regime. The conclusion is reached that significant cost savings are possible with On-Condition maintenance. The only valid reason for retaining a TBO in the mature transmission is the presence of wearout type non-detectable safety-affecting failure modes. These generally take the form of structural fatigue originating from fretted joints or surfaces or slow wear in internal spline and clutches. These modes may exist in some of today's transmissions and, if so, represent the limiting TBO. The full potential of On-Condition operation may not be realized without safety oriented changes. These changes include concepts which minimize or eliminate fretting, provide fail safety via redundancy or are tolerant to damage. Further improvement in condition monitoring and early, concentrated, development testing are the necessary ingredients for On-Condition main- tenance of tomorrow's helicopter transmissions. 700588. (P-32) The Use of U.S. Army Rotary Wing Mishap Experience to Assure Improved Product Effectiveness. Lt. Col. James T. Darrah, Jr. and J. L. Haley, Jr., U. S. Army Board for Aviation Accident Research. U.S. Army Board for Aviation Accident Research (US AB AAR) data are reviewed to define the general trends in rotary wing mishap experience. Factors which have caused aviation accidents are identified and com- pared to further define the accident prevention problem. The cause factors of materiel failure, malfunction and design deficiency are selected for further examination through a discussion of several examples taken from accident case histories. While component modification has long been employed to correct materiel deficiencies, it is shown that this approach has often fallen short of truly eliminating the problem. The application of the system safety concept in the elimination of materiel related accident cause factors in existing rotary wing aircraft is outlined. The close interrelationship of all assurance sciences is discussed as an essential element of risk management at any point in the life cycle of a system. The adaptability of this approach in military systems to civilian products is shown. 700589. (P-32) Utilization of Army Aviation Experiences via RAMMIT (Reliability and Maintainability Management Improvement Techniques). Lawrence Leonard Bishop, U.S. Army Aviation Systems Command. AVSCOM has been collecting maintenance data via TAERS/TAMMS since 1964 and the files containing this data encompass millions of records. RAMMIT (Relia- bility and Maintainability Management Improvement Techniques) is a system designed to process maintenance data and other data relevant to the operations and support of Army aircraft. RAMMIT has been in development for approximately one year and management type informa- tion is being made available on a scheduled and as requested basis. Omissions and errors in reported data have been studied extensively and the determination made that if the data are properly processed, useful and reliable infor- mation can be provided. This report describes some of the methods used to identify and quantify these discrepancies so that valid values could be presented for each item's characteristics. The large volume of data input and the numerous types of data elements being reported has necessitated the development of a well organized series of reports. Therefore, brief descriptions of the various RAMMIT reports that are available, or will be available soon, are also presented in this report. Other features of RAMMIT reports and the design philosophies used in presenting the information are described. Illustrations and tables are provided as exam- ples of the type of information that are included in RAMMIT reports. The basic objective of RAMMIT is to present experience data as management information and this report describes how this basic objective is being accomplished. 700590. (P-32) The Huey/Cobra M&amp;R Field Program Results and Significance. James A. Gean and George E. Knudsen, Bell Helicopter Co. The UH-l/AH-1 maintainability and reliability program has been in operation for six years. This paper briefly reviews the concepts on which the program is based, and outlines the history of the program as background for the main theme of the paper-review and evaluation of the program to determine its validity for use in the future. The data and analysis output of the program are evaluated in terms of their quality, quantity, and usefuh ness in making decisions which are significant in Army management of the UH-l/AH-1 production and logistics programs. Statistical tables and plots showing how</page><page sequence="86">700592-700599 pertinent factors have varied with time are used to demonstrate the degree to which the program has achieved its objectives of early identification and correc- tion of reliability and maintainability problems. Each M&amp;R program task is examined and the lessons learned from experience, and the conclusions drawn are presented. This includes, in addition to the contract work statement tasks, the management functions of organi- zation, staffing, training, and channels for decision making. The scope of the program is evaluated, and the factors limiting it are discussed. The possibility of including additional tasks is considered and some possibilities are suggested. Conclusions drawn throughout the paper are summarized and recommendations are made for im- proving future M&amp;R field programs for the next gener- ation of Army helicopters. 700592. (P-32) System Improvement Through Maintain- ability Demonstration. Harald R. Leuba, Office of the Secretary of Defense. Maintainability demonstration should be based on the whole operational setting. By so doing, and by estab- lishing, beforehand, agreements between the contractor and the customer concerning parameter values and individual responsibilities, maintainability demonstration can be much more effective at influencing system performance. Certain design/use trade-offs become ap- parent, and both contractor and customer can see the system performance costs of their theretofore implicit assumptions. This contention is illustrated with a main- tainability demonstration model for flight-line aircraft maintenance. 700593. (P-32) Acquisition of Restore Time Data by Subjective Techniques. Russell L. Smith and Ronald A. Westland, Integrated Sciences Corp. Development and application of maintainability models have been seriously constrained by the paucity of v valid human performance repair time data. Moreover, ther high costs of obtaining such data by empirical (observational) methods lend little hope that useful quantities of data will ever be available for widespread use of models. This state-of-affairs suggests the alternative, far less costly, method of acquiring these data by subjective judgments. This study therefore sought to explore the potential capabilities and limitations of highly experienced tech- nicians to provide repair time estimates on 23 electronic equipments. Results indicated high agreement among technicians across all equipments. Although validation work was not possible within the constraints of the study, the estimates were compared with data reported in the world-wide AF 66-1 maintenance reporting system. These latter data are known to be inflated, thus limiting their usefulness as model inputs. The result of this comparison revealed that all subjectively derived MTTR's were substantially lower than those generated from the AF 66-1 system, and the correlation between the two sets of MTTR's was a remarkably high .856. These findings strongly suggest that the estimated MTTR's may have practical validity; at minimum, they must be considered more representative of actual repair times than those available in the AF 66-1 system. Validation of these estimates and further study of subjective techniques is highly recommended. 700595. (P-32) Reliability Education. Martin L. Shooman, Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. The lack of sufficient formal education in the field of reliability is an accepted fact by both the engineering educator and reliability manager. This paper describes this problem in some detail and contrasts the state of reliability education with other more established disci- plines. Some of the previous ambitious attempts to remedy this situation are discussed and some more limited and perhaps more feasible suggestions are presented. 700596. (P-32) Reliability Education in Civil Engineering. Haresh C. Shah, Stanford University. This paper describes the program in reliability education for civil engineers at Stanford University. Mainly, grad- uate level program is described. The objectives of such a program and to what extent such objectives are achieved are discussed. It is observed that the reliability based program gives students a wider and more complete perspective in their engineering education. 700597. (P-32) The Reliability Engineering Education Program at the University of Arizona. Dimitri B. Kececioglu, The University of Arizona. The need for formally educated reliability engineers is pointed out. The Reliability Engineering Education Program developed at The University of Arizona in Tucson is described, and its present and future objectives are discussed. An appeal is issued to other educational institutions of higher learning to start and/or expand such programs to meet the great need for formally educated reliability engineers. '700598. (P-32) Impact on Engine Maintainability of Gaseous Radioactive Penetrant Inspections. William C. Eddy, Jr., Industrial Nucleonics i Corp. Recent developments of radioactive gas penetrants have shown a capability for measuring microscopic defects such as jare present in early low cycle fatigue. Reliable detection of these defects points the way to aircraft engine maintenance predicated on "condition" removal rather than time. The paper will deal with work now in progress using the new penetrant system on aircraft materials having defects typical of early low cycle fatigue. 700599. (P-32) Ultrasonic Holography in Nondestructive Testing. L. E. Goodwin and Robert S. Lovett, Ultrasonics Div., Holotron Corp. The ultrasonic holographic principle is described and 161</page><page sequence="87">700600-700606 162 several methods of producing ultrasonic holograms are outlined. A recently developed Holographic Ultrasonic Imager using a liquid-surface detector is described in detail. The instrument permits real-time imaging of test objects as they are moved through the ultrasonic field of view. Advantages of the instrument are discussed. The results of typical nondestructive test applications in metals, plastics, ceramics and composites are presented. 700600. (P-32) Nondestructive Testing - A Condition Monitored Maintenance Tool. Warren J. Weldon, American Airlines, Inc. This paper describes a recent change in the maintenance programs employed by the airlines to assure the integrity of their airframes, powerplants, and components. Non- destructive testing plays a very vital role in these maintenance programs by permitting critical areas to be monitored with relatively minor open-up to permit access to perform the inspections. 700603. (P-32) Commercial Application of Fault Tree Analysis. Paul A. Crosetti, Douglas United Nuclear, Inc.; and Richard A. Bruce, McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co. Fault Tree Analysis is considered one of the more powerful analytical techniques applied within the aero- space industry to evaluate critical safety hazards. Fault trees provide a method of evaluating the systems oper- ational risks of an undesirable outcome, where that undesirable outcome results from the system being in an unfavorable state and, while in that state, an unfavorable event occurs. This paper discusses the application of Fault Tree Analysis to evaluate system reliability and availa- bility. It has provided an effective quantitative tool for evaluating the risks of simultaneous occurrence of two or more independent events which, in combination, are singularly undesirable. Experience in applying this tech- nique to areas other than hazard analyses indicates that design and operational judgments are considerably strengthened, particularly on complex systems where the trade-offs among several feasible alternatives may oth- erwise be highly subjective. The potential for general application of Fault Tree Analysis to commercial prod- ucts appears attractive based not only on the successful extension from the aerospace safety technology to the nuclear reactor reliability and availability technology, but also because combinatorial hazards are common to commercial operations and therefore lend themselves readily to evaluation by Fault Tree Analysis. Therefore, it appears reasonable to conclude that the technique has application within the commercial industrial community where the occurrence of a specified consequence or final event would be of sufficient concern to management to justify such rigorous analysis as an aid to decision making. 700604. (P-32) Methodology to Define, Monitor and Control Life-Limited Components During Stor- age. J. C. DuBuisson, Martin Marietta Corp. This paper summarizes the multiplicity of technical methods employed by industry and government agencies to define, monitor and control life-limited aerospace components during storage. Recommendations are made concerning these methods that will assist the reader in the selection of the methodology to meet his particular program requirements. A life-limited component is one whose reliability or performance will deteriorate below acceptable limits due to either calendar aging or to usage before its service life is completed. With the stretch-out of many aerospace programs, the lives of many components may be approached or exceeded during the extended storage periods. Means must be found to extend and recertify the lives of affected components to prevent costly replacement programs. The methods described are discussed relative to compo- nents/systems in storage. However, these same methods can also be utilized either to insure that a new design will meet life requirements or to monitor and control life- limited components in service. Application of these methods to other than storage is discussed. The paper describes seven methods that can be employed to determine, confirm, and/or extend/recertify component lives. These methods include testing, sur- veillance, inspection, refurbishment, analysis, similarity, and waiver. Case histories are employed to illustrate the use of the methods. In addition, the management controls to monitor and control life-limited components are briefly discussed. A tabulation of the life limits applied to identical or similar components/systems by various organizations is presented to allow the reader to compare some of his estimated component lives with the estimates of others. 700605. (P-32) An Eclectic Approach to Long Life Reli- ability Measurement. T. J. Breen, General Elec- tric Co. The problem of measuring the reliability of a long life system is evaluated in situations where test data is limited due to cost and schedule constraints. Five advanced techniques are presented that will aid in the solution of this problem. Relationships between generic components and measurement techniques are outlined and the benefit of combining techniques to further magnify the test information is emphasized. Finally, two methods that will determine a system estimate from the various component measurement techniques are presented and compared. 700606. (P-32) The Analysis of the Effective Reliability of a System. J. J. Hadel and B. Krogull, McDonnell Aircraft Co. The purpose of this paper is to present an analytical technique which expands the classical definition of weapon system mission success probability to encompass degraded mode operation. The approach evaluates the effects upon system capability arising from each degraded state. The normalized sum of the capabilities in all system</page><page sequence="88">700607-700612 states, weighted by their probability of occurrence, is interpreted as the "Effective Reliability" of the system. The paper describes the technique of degraded mode evaluation and introduces a deterministic computer program to calculate system state probabilities. A dem- onstration of the application of the method is provided in the analysis of a fighter bomber system. 700607. (P-32) System for Utilization of Remote Equip- ment for Failure Investigation and Reliability Evaluation (Surefire). A. S. Kamp and J. J. Lydon, General Electric Co. This paper identifies the automated reliability data input, storage, processing, retrieval and output system developed by Information Systems and the Reliability and Effec- tiveness Evaluation Components of the General Electric Co., Re-entry and Environmental Systems Div. The system incorporates remote terminal inquiry, real time, time-sharing capability. Data batch processing service is provided as required for periodic EDP report outputs and customer contract reports. The system output features include failure history information, test history (time/cy- cle data) information, narrative management report capability and reliability numerical evaluation and as- sessment output reports. The approach to system devel- opment is defined and discussed. Adherence to the philosophy of providing working paper rather than paper work is developed and applied in this automated relia- bility data system. 700608. (P-32) A Reliable Solution to the Environmental Problem: The Hydrogen Engine. Richard G. Murray and Roger J. Schoeppel, Oklahoma State Univ. The present dilemma concerning the build-up in air pollutants from internal combustion engine emissions has stimulated interest and concern at all levels of society. Efforts so far have been directed towards exhaust clean-up and reduction in inj es ted lead compounds which offer only a temporary solution to the overall problem. Additionally, most authorities fail to mention that carbon dioxide is also an undesirable air pollutant. The use of an overall energy systems concept has resulted in a concentrated University research effort which may lead to a solution of this environmental problem in its broadest definition. The objective of the research has been the development of a hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine. Results to date indicate that this type engine is not only technically possible but also economically feasible. It remains, however, for industry to apply its expertise in technical and management capa- bilities to assure further improvement with respect to cost, reliability, maintainability, safety, and related factors. This paper firstly places in perspective the overall air-pollution-by-vehicles problem, secondly proposes its long-range solution, thirdly outlines previous efforts which lead to the development of the first "emission-free" internal combustion engine, and finally presents the challenge for industry to improve on the suggested approach or develop a better solution to this environ- mental problem. 700610. (P-32) Assessment of Marine Systems' Reliability and Maintainability. R. L. Harrington, J. W. Coats and F. E. Farley, The Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. The need for an increased emphasis on the reliability and maintainability characteristics of shipboard systems is discussed. Next, the current reliability and maintainability specification requirements are surveyed and their impact on the marine industry is reviewed. This is followed by a description and evaluation of the various types of reliability and maintainability analyses which may be applied to shipboard systems. Insofar as marine equip- ments are concerned, the major sources of data, its availability, and utility are also reviewed. Lastly, the salient aspects of the Aircraft Carrier CVAN 68 Relia- bility and Maintainability Program are described. 700611. (P-32) The Navy's New Maintenance Data Col- lection Subsystem. Alan O. Plait, Computer Sciences Corp. Examples are presented to show method of using the new computer-produced reports of the Navy's Maintenance Data Collection Subsystem. Development of components of the data processing system are described, together with definitions and applied statistical techniques. A matrix of the reports is given to show inter-relationship. The reports present data, statistically derived from the historical data base, on such equipment parameters as reliability, main- tainability, availability, manpower costs, parts costs, and others. 700612. (P-32) Application of Reliability to a Naval Weapon System. Robert E. Snyder, Naval Ship System Command. The LHA ship is the first application of reliability at the ship and subsystem level for a naval combatant ship. Until the advent of the LHA project the use of the reliability discipline within the U.S. Navy had generally been confined to the component or "black box" level and usually in the electronics field. The expressed purpose of the reliability program is to impact the ship design which will lead to the delivery of a better weapons system to the Navy. This paper describes the scope of effort undertaken to comply with Military Standard MIL-STD-785. The three phases of this extensive undertaking are discussed, namely definition of requirements, performance of analytical tasks to support the requirements and verification of requirements. The data sources employed and the meth- ods of utilization are also described. Certain conclusions are presented based on accomplishments to date and expectations for the future portion of the contract. 163</page><page sequence="89">700615-700625 164 700615. (P-32) Reliability and Availability of the DD963 Destroyer Program. A. R. DiTrapani and J. J. Dumbleton, Department of the Navy. The U.S. Navy is currently utilizing the concept forma- tion/contract definition method of ship procurement for the multi-year acquisition of the DD963 class destroyers. A reliability/maintainability/availability program has been implemented for this project. As a result of studies performed, the development and production contract includes quantitative availability values at the ship and subsystem level, MTBF/MTTR values for a few selected equipments, and sequential availability tests for the total ship system and propulsion subsystem. In addition, a failure data collection and corrective action program will be implemented which will provide inputs to an MTBF/MTTR data bank and the tri-service/NASA failure rate data (FARADA) program. 700617. (P-32) Maintenance and Reliability Simulation Modeling for Airfreighters. H. D. Hall and W. G. Ness, Lockheed-Georgia Co. A maintenance and reliability simulation model has been developed which can be used to evaluate and optimize the maintainability and reliability characteristics of an air- craft and the maintenance and logistic resources required to support the aircraft. The model is programmed to simulate any aircraft type or series. Its uniqueness to a specific design arises by virtue of the input data supplied to the "aircraft characteristics" segment of the model. The validity and accuracy of the model logic have been verified by simulating the maintenance operations of a fleet of aircraft being operated in scheduled service and comparing the model output with actual in-service reported data. 700619. (P-32) Needed: Space Maintenance Tools. R. M. Belless, Jr. and L. R. Anderson, Martin Marietta Corp. This paper discusses the potential need for space main- tenance tools or long-duration, manned space missions currently expected during the 1972-1980 time period. A review of technical needs for took is provided that suggests space maintenance capabilities can both main- tain and extend system reliability, thereby enabling longer-duration mission times and greater assurance of crew safety. Current analysis techniques used to determine high- priority maintenance requirements, tooling and checkout needs, and maintenance constraints upon system designs are also reviewed. The correlation between space main- tenance at various levels of application, and a space maintenance tooling capability is described. Other cor- relations that serve to illustrate useful applications of space tools are reviewed, and are inclusive of the following: 1. Tools needed to maintain systems and tools used in experiments that provide information of value to the development of future spacecraft systems. 2. Primary functions of tools, and tooling aspects that satisfy space safety, space materials compatibility, launch vibration, and space translation requirements. Methods and facilities useful for demonstration testing of space maintenance tools are both illustrated and described. Various facilities capable of simulating zero-g space environment are available as test bed for conduct of space-simulated maintenance operations. This paper emphasizes maximum use of ground-based, space simu- lation capabilities to gain experience with basic tool configurations, and man's adaptability to space main- tenance tasks. 700620. (P-32) A Method for Assessing a System's Operational Effectiveness. Eugene Selig, Litton Systems, Inc. A method is presented for assessing the operational effectiveness of avionics hardware when formal means do not exist for supplier/user accumulation and evaluation of field data. The equipment selected for consideration was developed in 1962 and nearly 3500 systems have been delivered. Data provided are based on an evaluation of 76,000 flights; 150,000 flight hr; and 268,000 system operating hours, and confirm good system performance in the field. This paper emphasizes the importance of understanding the differences between various perform- ance parameters and discusses problems which may be experienced in the absence of such knowledge. 700624. (P-32) A Mission Success Model for Unmanned Space Exploration. M. J. Shumaker and R. C. Cary, Martin Marietta Corp. A mission success model has been developed which provides a more realistic picture of mission success while avoiding the customary cumbersome and time consuming operational methods. The model is based upon the expected data returned (probabilistic) which is integrated with respect to time for each scientific experiment and summed for the mission. The computer technique utilizes the machine as a comprehensive data bank. The expected data return, when combined with the computer technique, provides greatly improved visibility of mission success probability. 700625. (P-32) A Complex Weapon System Bayes' Strat- egy Using Component Test Data. Peter V. Z. Cole, Naval Ammunition Depot. The paper defines a "best" estimate of system effec- tiveness or reliability as one that minimizes the potential loss due to either overestimating or underestimating such a system figure of merit. A loss function is expressed in terms of the decision maker's order of preference for the consequences of either overestimation (underkill) or underestimation (overkill). However, in order for an estimate to be optimal, sufficient information at the system level should be provided. This lack or abundance of information is reflected in the variability of the measurement of system effectiveness or reliability. The</page><page sequence="90">700626-700630 variability and central tendency of this measurement are obtained from the variability and central tendency of the component data. This is achieved through the combined use of effectiveness or reliability models, Monte Carlo simulation and/or probability moments, and Bayesian statistics. 700626. (P-32) Generation of Failure Data Fitting a Specified Hazard Function. Martin L. Shooman, James Johnsen and Robert Straub, Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. This paper pertains to tools for evaluating statistical tests on failure data. During the reasearch and evaluation phases associated with reliability testing, it frequently becomes necessary to apply the proposed statistical test to a set of failure data with certain known hazards. The use of actual failure data is seldom satisfactory at this point, since the true data does not represent some pure distribution, but represents a mixture of various distri- butions. This paper presents a set of computational techniques which generate failure data which fit specified hazard functions. Failure data may appear in two different forms. In one case, the number of failures occurring in each interval of time is reported. This is known as class interval data. The paper discusses one set of technqiues for generating class interval data which approximates a prespecified hazard. In other situations the actual times to failure for each failure are desired. In such a case, a different computa- tional technique is used. A simple example illustrating the computations is discussed for both class interval data and time to failure data. The concluding section treats a comprehensive ex- ample in which data is generated to fit a piecewise linear hazard curve which closely approximates the familiar "bathtub" curve. The computer program which was used to generate the data in this example is included in the appendix. The theoretical and experimental hazard curves are compared to show the good agreement between the generated data and the underlying model. 700627. (P-32) Hazard Functions, Renewal Rates and Peril Rates. Harold Ascher, Consultant. Reliability models appropriate to non-repairable parts, sockets, and repairable systems are presented. It is shown that a renewal process is usually appropriate as a model for a socket but generally is implausible as a repairable system model. Several models for repairable systems are proposed. These include a model where system state depends only on the total age of the system and models where system state is a function of total age and the total number of part replacements. Then, it is shown that the applicability of any given probabilistic model to a given system is questionable because of many "real world" factors which are difficult to treat probabilistically. Therefore, it is proposed that the statistical approach is the proper one in determining how real systems behave. The realiability community is called upon to present all available data and appropriate analyses in order to establish a firm empirical foundation for repairable system reliability. In Appendix A the distribution of the interarrivai time to second system failure of a two part system is derived. Based on this result, Appendices B and C demonstrate that (when nothing is known about the first failure) the interarrivai times to first and second system failures will be independently and identically distributed if, and only if, both parts have constant hazard functions. Relaxation of the constant hazard function requirement when information about the first failure is available is discussed in Appendix B. 700629. (P-32) System Safety Analysis Techniques ... A Tool for a Safe Design or a Waste. J. Frederick Medford, System Safety Consultant. If system safety analysis are to have a payoff in the design process, to assure they are not a waste, they must start in the early proposal cycle and become an integral part of the project planning and control cycle. This has been a real problem on major weapon system developments in recent years and has prevented proper implementation of the analysis effort. The heart of the system safety program effort is embodied in the system safety analysis types described in this paper. The problem is knowing when to use these analyses to minimize the cost of implementation and to get the greatest payoff. Knowing when to use these analyses judiciously comes with experience. Appendix A describes when each type safety analysis should be performed starting with the Concept Formulation Phase thru the Operational Phase of weapon system devel- opment. The objective of system safety analyses is to provide the data and analysis so that designers can make decisions on the acceptability of the system/subsystem design from a safety standpoint. 700630. (P-32) Acceptance Criteria for Demonstrating System Safety Requirement. H. Harvey Moon, Jr. and Walter E. Knowles, General Dynam- ics/Fort Worth Div. System safety requirements for the two most recent USAF aircraft systems have consisted of an accident probability, a confidence level, and the test period for demonstrating the requirement. For each set of values for these parameters, there is a maximum number of accidents that can occur during the demonstration period. It is this maximum number of accidents that is of importance in the demonstration period. The task of determining the maximum number of accidents is not as simple and straightforward as some have tried to make it. The significance of the three parameters is explained and the procedure is given for using statistical sampling tech- niques to arrive at the equivalent accident rate. 165</page><page sequence="91">700632-700638 166 700632. (P-32) A Systems Engineering Approach to Safety for a Naval Operational Unit. Frank J. Denny, Martin Marietta Corp. System Safety Engineering techniques are frequently used to discover and correct potential hazards in military equipment. MIL-S-38130 and MIL-STD-882 require the use of systems methodology for assuring that designed hardware can be used operationally with an acceptable degree of safety. The System Safety techniques and methodology discussed here are applied to a military program but the same techniques and methodology are applicable to any operational unit. The techniques and methodology developed for the military can yield many dividends when applied anywhere that a hazardous operation may exist. The CVA (aircraft carrier) incident/accident rate, coupled with the severity of recent aircraft carrier accidents, is unacceptable (to the Navy) for efficient carrier operation, as well as being costly from both personnel and equipment viewpoints. In the attempt to provide improved turn-around time during cyclic oper- ations, safety regulations are strained because of urgent operational requirements. Current disjointed and seg- mented methods of aircraft servicing and arming during cyclic operations are caused by the complexity of numerous actions required. The problem is compounded due to the differences in safety procedures and regulations between CV A's. The program outlined herein was proposed to the U.S. Navy by Harvey Aluminum Company as a means to improve safety of aircraft carrier operations during a critical period of operation, the "turn-around" cycle. It was prepared for the CASS (Carrier Aircraft Support Study) proposal. The operational aspects of the CVW/CVA complex are peculiar to the Navy and have no known industrial equivalent, even though daily decisions concerning personnel, plans and programs are alike in many respects. However, the Systems Engineering approach and the integration of all systems into a cohesive overall management program are applicable to industry. It is the Systems Engineering approach to a complex problem which will be discussed in this paper. 700634. (P-32) The Economics of Reliability. Ralph H. Dudley, Kenneth K. Hekimian and Howard Laitin, University of Southern California. In this age of increasingly complex systems, the rapidly multiplying costs of unreliability have become an impor- tant problem to manufacturer, consumer, and govern- ment. At the same time, however, the cost of failure prevention is increasing relative to the total cost of the system. The cost of failure prevention is comprised of the costs of implementing one or more elements of reliability: redundancy, environmental design and environmental testing. Existing approaches to these elements of relia- bility, while capable of optimizing one element, sub- optimize the system because they do not synthesize all three on a benefit/cost basis. The main emphasis of this paper is the conceptualiza- tion and development of a computerized comprehensive methodology. The methodology synthesizes the elements of reliability to provide the decision making organization with the capability to simultaneously evaluate the risk to the system, and the optimal allocation of resources to the elements of reliability, both as a function of budget over a broad range of dollar budgets. 700635. (P-32) Reliability Enforcement in Design (Using Gyroscopes as an Example). William G. Denhard, Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, MIT. From the customer's viewpoint, there are really only two ways to acquire reliability in a design. One is competition based on performance (rather than price). The second is an adequate test program with agreed-upon procedures and requirements established at the time of initial purchase and covered by the price. Sufficient experience (some in government procurement) where neither of these conditions applied warrants a serious look at techniques for forcing reliability into design. This paper attempts to do just that and, additionally, emphasizes the need for pre-established test programs and test results at the time the contract is awarded. Using gyroscopes as an example, it actually shows the savings possible when total cost including maintenance is considered. 700636. (P-32) Airborne Electronic Equipment Guaran- tees. R. H. Myers and C. M. De Witt III, Hughes Aircraft Co. A study of airborne electronic equipment guarantees concentrated in five complementary areas: evaluation of current guarantee practices, guarantee plan application considerations, development of guarantee plan procure- ment packages, guarantee plan cost models and related procedures and guarantee plan implementation require- ments. Study results indicated that sealed, Air Force de- pot/supplier repairable, high dollar value, low MTBF units were most amenable to Air Force avionic guarantee applications. Of the three types of guarantee plans analyzed, the full life approach was considered currently feasible for the Air Force to implement. The most difficult implementation areas was considered to involve the maximum failure rate guarantee plan where operating time, as well as failure responsibility, become important criteria. The failure free guarantee, although currently feasible to implement, was not considered cost effective for avionic equipments. Conversely, both the full life and maximum failure rate approaches appeared cost effective in terms of potential savings to the Air Force. Specific savings or losses are dependent on acutal MTBF's, repair times, repair costs, and bid variables. 700638. (P-32) An Application of Reliability Theory to Process Design. Neil D. Cox, University of Arizona.</page><page sequence="92">700640-700643 The principles of reliability theory were used to study the sizing of chemical process trains. Based on the idea that larger equipment may have reduced availability, it was found that smaller, parallel process trains can, under certain conditions, offset the capital cost advantage of a single, large process train. 700640. (P-32) The Application of an Integrated Struc- tural Analysis to the Prediction of Reliability. K. W. Bills, Jr. and J. H. Wiegand, Aerojet Solid Propulsion Co. The methods developed in recent years for measuring and characterizing the mechanical behavior of solid propellant and utilizing this information in structural analyses to predict rocket motor structural integrity are reviewed in terms of the applicability of this approach to other materials and applications. It is shown that the recog- nition of statistical distributions of response and failure behaviors leads to the prediction of the distribution of failure times in actual use. The combining of behavior data with structural analysis to give a cumulative damage prediction of failure is shown to be possible through the use of the computer. The development of reliability is shown to start with the development of the tests used to evaluate the material, which must measure those properties directly pertinent to the structural requirements. The product structural re- quirements are converted into test requirements through analytical and experimental stress analyses. Viscoelastic analysis, supported by photoelastic model studies, defines the critical regions of stress and strain in the proposed design, and the correct tests are then selected based on close simulation of the expected stress conditions and failure modes. Estimates of the lower confidence limits of the critical parameters can then be calculated and compared with the corresponding confidence limits from the stress analysis to assess the safety margin, the results indicating those critical points where design revision must be balanced against propellant reformulation to provide adequate safety margins. 700641. (P-32) Deterministic versus Probabilistic Models in Slider-Crank Function Generator Design. George R. Schade and Charles R. Mischke, Iowa State University. The objective of this paper is to raise the question "Are models deduced using deterministic methods the best models to use in situations where nondeterministic conditions prevail?" The examples cited involve the synthesis of slider-crank function generators and their subsequent assembly from real links. The optimal linkage which displays the least possible extreme error represents a deterministic model. Can a different linkage with greater extreme structural error be a superior manufacturing ideal? The examples show that it can in the case of the offset slider-crank function generator. 700642. (P-32) An Approach to Reliability Determination of a Rotating Component Subjected to Complex Fatigue. Vincent R. Lalli, Lewis Research Cen- ter, NASA.; and Dimitri B. Kececioglu, Uni- versity of Arizona. A methodology for determining the reliability of me- chanical components is given. The necessary design data are pointed out. Complex fatigue research machines are described, which are generating the required fatigue strength data in terms of cycles to failure and endurance strength. The test loading is that of alternating bending combined with steady torque. The design data obtained are presented. The design by reliability methodology and data are applied to the design of an actual alternator rotor inner shaft, and the results are compared with those obtained by conventional design procedure. 700643. (P-32) Prediction of Ball Bearing Assembly Life from the Two-Parameter Weibull Life Distri- butions of the Components. John E. Mayer, Jr., Ford Motor Co. This paper presents a method for predicting the life of a ball bearing assembly from the lives of its components. An important application of this method is the prediction of the improvement in bearing assembly life which would be obtained by improvement of one or more of the com- ponents. Bearing fatigue life experiments have shown that the cumulative distribution functions, i.e. the cumulative percent failed versus life relationships, for the bearing components, as well as the bearing assembly, can be approximated by two-parameter Weibull distributions. The components of a ball bearing assemply; that is, the inner race, the ball complement and the other race, are arranged in series. Survival of the assembly requires survival of all of the components. The approach employed in this paper is based on the theorem that the probability of survival of the assembly is given by the product of the survival probabilities of the components. The survival function method is not new, but it is believed that this paper presents a novel application of this method to ball bearings for predicting the assembly life. By this method the cumulative distribution function for the assembly was computed from survival functions of the components obtained from experimental data. This computed result was compared to the cumulative distribution function plotted from experimental data for the assembly. The Weibull hypothesis test method of Dubey was employed for this comparison and it was concluded that the computed result estimates the assembly life with sufficient accuracy. It was further concluded . that the cumulative distribution function for the assembly can be approx- imated in the computation with a two-parameter Weibull distribution. Formulas are derived which allow the Weibull parameters for the assembly to be calculated directly from the Weibull parameters of the components. This provides a simple and sufficiently accurate method for predicting the performance of a ball bearing assembly as a function of the performance of the bearing com- ponents provided the component survival probabilities are independent. 167</page><page sequence="93">700645-700649 168 700645. (P-32) Reliability Prediction Models for Micro- circuits. D. C. Porter and W. A. Finke, The Boeing Co. Some of the common methods of reliability prediction utilizing calendar or lot size dependence and various "k" factors for complexity, end use, product family, and environment are briefly reviewed. These techniques, although sometimes accurate and simple, do not provide adequate reliability tradeoff information and do not fully treat the effects of vendor variability and improvements in the state-of-the-art. From these techniques it is frequently difficult to understand causes of observed failure rates and to determine what can be done to achieve cost- effective reliability. One method of alleviating these objections is to derive a model based on microcircuit failure mode and mech- anism knowledge. The current status of microcircuit failure knowledge is reviewed. Considerable use is made of data which has been acquired at very high stress levels and the relationship between this data and end use data is discussed. Microcircuit failures can be grouped into four essen- tially independent categories: failures due to time deg- radation, failures due to mechanical stress, serial failures due to two or more events occurring in succession, and parts which never worked. A failure prediction model based on failure modes and mechanism knowledge would contain each of these elements. The resulting model might prove unwieldy and of dubious value because of its size. However, a simplified model can be employed. If the user knows how it was derived, it can be a useful and flexible tool. One form that such a model might take is presented and discussed. 700646. (P-32) MOS Reliability Prediction Model. M. F. Adam and D. M. Aaron, Autonetics Div., North American Rockwell Corp. The determination of component part failure rates is required for most military contracts normally during the early portion of the program definition phase. For new technology devices whose failure rates have not been established nor available in recognized military docu- ments, it has been impossible to accurately predict the reliability of the system using these new devices. A technique developed by authors enables a prediction to be made for new state-of-the-art devices using a mathe- matical transfer model. This paper describes a mathematical transfer model using established failure rate data from bipolar integrated circuits (IC). These bipolar devices contain similar characteristics, basic materials, processes, testing, inspec- tion, environmental, physics of failure, and application, to the new device. Failure rates for the new device, large scale array (LSA) metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) are obtained through use of this model. From the example described in this paper, extensive empirical bipolar IC postmortem analysis was analyzed, normalized and related to the commonalities of MOS technology. The failure mechanisms were grouped into the following major defect categories: passivation, metal- lization, leads, diffusion, die bonding, foreign material, packaging, contamination, and material discrepancies. Each of these defects was then normalized to diffusion area, metal area, number of leads, average lead pad size, thin oxide area, gate area, crossover area and internal package area. A transfer model was then established to estimate the percent of the failure mode applicable to the MOS device along with the justification. The results of the completed transfer model enables a reliability prediction to be made by summing the contributions of each major failure mechanism based on the applicable areas and number of leads. A ten percent contingency factor is added to this total to account for failure mechanisms unique to the MOS device. 700647. (P-32) Quality and Maintainability Measurement of Micro-Electronic Consumer Products. Franklin C. Brewster, Motorola, Inc. A simple, customer interrogation technique is described for manufacturers to obtain an unbiased consumer reaction to product quality and reliability. The plan will highlight variations between consumer reaction „ and factory tests. An example of product deterioration in storage is cited to illustrate how the system can identify problems and check on their resolution. 700649. (P-32) Thermal Cycle Effects on MIB Reliability. H. C. Hurley, Federal Systems Div., Interna- tional Business Machines Corp. In an effort to further the understanding of the physics of MIB failure extensive tests were conducted to determine the effects of MIB-PTH reliability of: 1. long-term thermal cycle environments 2. selected MIB design parameters, and 3. selected MIB processing parameters. This paper presents the most significant results of these tests. Each of the eighteen MIB's tested contained approx- imately 1,300 PTH's divided evenly among thirty-four circuits. Three thermal cycle environments were selected for testing with each of these environments being within severe but realistic military use conditions. Test accel- eration was achieved by a new experimental concept termed "enhanced-defect" testing. With careful choice of test article design and manufacture, failure mechanisms which occur only rarely in a normal produce sample may be observed and analyzed in large numbers, in a controlled defect-enhancement sample. Implementation of the enhanced-defect concept on the eighteen test MIB's resulted in six MIB types differing in the degree and type of defect-enhancement. Some MIB's were manufactured with excessive amounts of "epoxy-smear", others were purposely poorly laminated and still other MIB's were produced with thin hole plate, irregular hole plate or brittle hole plate to determine how these variables affected the PTH failure processes. Finally,</page><page sequence="94">700650-700656 a number of MIB's were manufactured with optimum characteristics to serve as experimental control samples. Circuit resistance measurements were periodically made throughout environmental exposure on all test MIB's. Microscopic examinations were performed on hundreds of PTH's during and at test completion. Point-to-point continuity profiles of numerous test circuits were completed after environmental test. The data acquired during the 60-million PTH-hours of testing, the 10,000 electrical measurements, the numerous micro- sections and the hundreds of circuit continuity profiles were analyzed in depth to determine the effects of the programmed design and processing parameters on MIB reliability. 700650. (P-32) Overcoming Obstacles to System Safety in the Surface Modes of Transportation. Henry H. Wakeland, National Transportation Safety Board. The benefits of system safety are recognized and widely used in military and NASA aerospace fields, but the national need for system safety is primarily in the surface modes. An organization chart for system safety is used to discuss application problems in the surface modes from diffuse organization historical non-systematic develop- ment, and barriers to communication or control. Favor- able developments in system organization and steps to promote applications of system safety are discussed. 700651. (P-32) Evaluation of a Safety Program. P. H. Bolger, National Aeronautics and Space Ad- ministration. A systematic approach to safety evaluation can be a valuable tool to the safety official and to the engineering manager. The effective use of this tool will reduce the frequency of mishaps, and when mishaps do occur (as in the Apollo 13 mission), it will assure that a maximum number of alternatives are available to minimize the danger to personnel. 700652. (P-32) Product Safety Assurance through System Safety Techniques. Rex B. Gordon and Phillip Woodbury, General Electric Co. The increasing concern for consumer protection against unsafe products requires that management attention be focused on the most effective means available for assuring inherent safety in their products. The basic principles embodied in the system safety discipline evolving within the aerospace community provides a basis for effective consumer product safety practice. The relationships between system safety concepts as used in complex aerospace programs and safety assurance in consumer products are explored with specific guidelines provided. 700653. (P-32) The Development of Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. H. M. Jacklin, Jr., National Highway Safety Bureau. Criteria are discussed concerning the development of an compliance with the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The initial and new safety standards are being evaluated continuously in terms of the concepts and techniques of system safety. The standards are also being updated in terms of minimum requirements for appli- cation to specific categories of vehicles and equipment. The interrelationship of reliability and maintainability requirements to vehicle safety is receiving increased system safety emphasis, and in upgrading motor vehicle safety positive steps are being taken to include such requirements in the new and in the vehicle in use standards now under development. 700655. (P-32) Quality and Safety Factors in Reliability. P. M. Ghare, Virginia Polytechnic Institute. The objective of this paper is to describe the reliability of a system component as a function of both the safety factor used in the design and the quality factor associated with the production of the component. Under the normal operating conditions the component is subjected to some environmental stress and to withstand this stress the component is designed with a safety factor v. In practice the design of the component is broken down into individual dimensions and the production specifications are derived for these dimensions. The strength of the components (when produced) would consequently be function of the quality of production. Thus it is possible to describe the reliability as a function of both the safety factor v and quality of production q. This function is computed, for specific assumptions, and the graphs are included in the paper. The principal advantage of this analysis would be the recognition of a possible trade-off within the resources allocated to better production and those assigned to higher safety factors. The same reliability would be achieveable either through a very high safety factor with poor production quality or through a lower safety factor with better production quality. The optimal resource allocation could be obtained through the solution of a mathematical programming problem: Maximize Relia- bility = f(q,u) Subjects to R(q) + R(u) ^ Rmax 700656. (P-32) Extended Reliability Basis of Structural Design Under Uncertainties. Alfredo H.-S. Ang, University of Illinois. A fundamental extension of the classical reliability concept is described. This extension or generalization is necessary to allow the consideration of subjective as well as objective factors in engineering design. Objective uncertainties are treated in explicit probability terms, whereas subjective uncertainties are handled through a "judgment factor" that may be evaluated on the basis of subjective probabilities . The risk of failure then becomes the product of two probabilities. Designs obtained on the basis of this extended reliability concept are not overly sensitive to the required distribution functions; thus, approximate statistical information in terms of means and variances should suffice for practical purposes. 169</page><page sequence="95">700657-700663 170 700657. (P-32) Statistical Evaluation of Load Factors in Structural Design. Haresh C. Shah, Stanford University.; and Wilson H. Tang, University of Illinois. A procedure leading to the determination of load factors is formulated based on the following criteria: 1. The load factors should provide a desired level of structural safety with respect to all loading configuration. 2. This desired level of reliability may be determined by economic factors such as cost of construction and the cost of failure of the structural system. 3. Load factors for individual element design may be determined by the desired level of reliability of the whole system. 4. Additional information about the loading environment and material strength characteristics can be systematically incorporated into the procedure to obtain a better set of load factors. 5. The procedure to evaluate load factors should be simple in form and easy for application. In the formulation that is presented here, dead, live, wind and earthquake loads are included. First, the load factors for a given reliability level for a structural element are calculated and second, the optimal reliability level of the structural system, its relationship with element reliability and the economic considerations in determining optimal reliability are considered. Step by step procedure is outlined and numerical example is worked out to illustrate the sim- plicity of the procedure. 700658. (P-32) Distributions of Strength in Simple Fa- tigue and the Associated Reliabilities. Dimitri B. Kececiglu, University of Arizona.; Richard E. Smith, Sandia Labs.; and Ernest A. Felsted, U.S. Army Weapons Command. A method for determining fatigue strength distributions at specific cycles of finite life, given cycles-to-failure data, is presented and applied to steel and aluminum wire fatigue data. Methods for calculating the reliability designed into a part for a specified cycle of finite life are given and are illustrated for the cases when the level of the maximum alternating operating stress is kept essentially constant, or has normal or a Weibull distribution. 700659. Influence of Racing on Passenger Tire Devel- opment. H. E. Mills and V. A. Caravito, Good- year Tire &amp; Rubber Co. In the rubber industry, and specifically with respect to rubber pneumatic tires, the racing tire and its design serve as an advanced-planning tool for passenger tire design, which has been influenced greatly by it. This paper discusses the characteristics of racing tires, their require- ments, and design, and describes certain of their features that have been adopted in passenger car tires. 700660. The Medical Aspects of Driver Protection Sys- tems and Devices Developed Through Automobile Racing. John D. States, University of Rochester School of Medicine.; George Snively, Sacra- mento Medical Center.; and H. A. Fenner, Automobile Manufacturers Association. This three-part paper deals with the medical aspects of driver protection in automobile racing. Part one presents the history of car safety equipment beginning with the development of helmets, belts, roll bars, and other devices to protect competition drivers. This paper describes the evolution from purely optional to mandatory equipment and how their design and accident records have con- tributed to increased safety in passenger cars. The investigation of injuries sustained in crash, fire, and loss of control caused by road hazards have contributed to the many improvements discussed here, almost all of which are readily adaptable to passenger car models. The second part presents a summary of the influence of racing on the design, testing, and performance standards for protective headgear. The significance is indicated of applying basic principles of mechanics and dynamic systems testing to all fields in which head impact is a potential hazard. Part three states that standard football helmets do not afford the protective qualities possible under the present state-of-the-art of helmet manufacturing. Deficiencies are pointed out. Experience with a fiberglass shell and nonresilient liner as used in auto racing is related. Many improvements were found over the standard football helmet, not only in greater protection but also in increased comfort. 700662. Fuels and Lubricants for Steam Propulsion Systems. T. O. Wagner, American Oil Co. Automotive steam propulsion systems would have modest fuel quality requirements, but they would probably consume 50% more fuel than conventional gasoline engines giving the same vehicle performance. Lubricant needs of steam systems are still poorly defined, but they would include good rust protection, demulsibility, and stability. The petroleum industry could meet these fuel requirements with little new technology, but a substantial increase in capital would be needed for expanded refining, exploration, production, and transportation facilities. Meeting lubricant needs would require a technical development program. Nevertheless, if steam-powered vehicles appear in significant numbers, commercial fuels and lubricants will be available for them. 700663. A Rational Approach to the Regulation of Truck Performance. L. F. Donnelly, Mack Trucks, Inc. The premise of this paper is that the commonly heard proposals for regulating maximum gross loads of heavy commercial vehicles either do not reflect actual per- formance potential or are not practical to apply. A refinement of the gross weight per unit horsepower method is proposed in which the average horsepower available over the operating range of the engine would be substituted for any instantaneous value of power. This modification offers the advantage of reflecting the benefit of increases in the number of gear reduction steps and</page><page sequence="96">700664-700670 tends to compensate for differences in horsepower versus engine speed characteristics. 1970 SA E Transactions 700664. Acceleration Performance of Highway Diesel Trucks. Thomas D. Hutton, Freightliner Corp. This paper reports the results of level road acceleration performance measurement of a group of randomly selected intercity diesel trucks. The ratio of gross com- bination vehicle weight to gross engine horsepower is correlated with acceleration performance. The results of the tests are presented in the form of graphs displaying distance versus time, speed versus time, and distance versus speed for weight to power ratios of 100, 200, 300, and 400 lb/hp. The effect of high torque rise engines with five-speed transmissions, as well as transmission shift time, on acceleration performance is also reported. A graphical determination of passing time and passing distance for a low-speed pass maneuver as used by the Department of Transportation for passenger cars is presented, based on actual acceleration performance data. 1970 SA E Transactions 700665. Economic Analysis of Power Options for Line Haul Vehicles. Peter W. Schutz and Max J. Reinhart, Cummins Engine Co. A computer simulation model is used to study the impact of several alternative equipment combinations on the profitability of a hypothetical line haul freight carrier. The model makes it possible for the analyst to consider the combined effect of factors such as speed, weight and capacity on the profitability of his operations. Questions relating to trailer and engine selection are analyzed. 1970 SA E Transactions 700666. Advanced Diesel Power Testing Techniques. Don C. Janess, Allen Electric and Equipment Co.; and Howard K. Manning, The Birtcher Corp. This two-part paper covers advanced diesel power testing techniques for diesel power vehicles. The first part is concerned with an automatic diagnostic system capable of diagnosing malfunctions in diesel powered vehicles which has recently been developed. Diagnosis of fuel system, charging system, starting system, and cooling system can be accomplished by a relatively unskilled operator. The diagnostic system implements new design techniques, which greatly reduce the possibility of damage to both test equipment and vehicle under test, regardless of errors in hookup or use. The second part discusses silicon strain gage tech- nology which has been found ideal for automotive analysis. Transducers have been developed and tested for a wide range of installations including diesel fuel injection pumps. Static through very high frequency data is illustrated over an operational life or greater than 100 million cycles. 700667. Development of Mack's Diesel Engine Lubricant Recommendations. W. R. Alexander, Mack Trucks, Inc. Controlled laboratory engine tests produced a correlation between the rates of viscosity and oxidation increase and the increase in engine bmep. A multicylinder turbocharged engine test procedure was developed which correlated with field experience of known lubricants. The Mack EO-G oil recommendation was based on results obtained by evaluating representative oils of different additive levels by this test procedure. 700668. The Measurement of the Viscosity Stability of Multigrade Engine Oils and Its Effect on Per- formance. W. W. Crouse, Sun Oil Co.; and G. W. Wilkins, Aberdeen Research and Devel- opment Center. It is shown that the measurement of the viscosity stability of multigrade engine oils containing different VI im- provers is dependent upon the shearing action of the test instrument. Mechanical rather than cavitational stresses must be used to obtain an accurate prediction of field performance. Car make as well as average engine speed influence the equilibrium viscosity of the used oil. The effect of shear stability on other performance charac- teristics of the multigrade oil are described in this paper. Discussion: D. T.

Mondt, W. H. Haverdink and W. R. Wade, General Motors Research Labs. Two steam-powered passenger cars have been designed, built, and tested. The SE- 101 is an intermediate sport coupe incorporating the comfort and convenience features of a modern passenger car, and has vehicle performance comparable to a low-powered automobile. The SE- 124 is a very low-power intermediate sedan with manual start and semiautomatic control. The characteristics of these cars were evaluated relative to the operational requirements of current transportation needs, with particular emphasis on exhaust emissions. Start-up time, exhaust emissions, fuel economy, acceleration, and water consumption data are presented. Although any one of these characteristics may 171</page><page sequence="97">700671-700678 172 be improved at the expense of others, it does not appear that any compromise can satisfy all of the areas required by today's motorist.

A Status Report on the Development of the 1973 California Diesel Emissions Standards. R. C. Bascom, Cummins Engine Co., Inc.; and G. C. Hass, California Air Resources Board. This paper is a summary of the cooperative effort by the California Air Resources Board Staff, the Engine Manu- facturers Association, and the SAE Deisel Emissions Subcomittee to develop the test procedures and meas- urement methods needed before adoption of emissions standards for unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides from diesel engines. Emphasis is placed on the development of the 13-mode test cycle and on the philosophy and reasoning behind the use of new or different procedures such as brake specific emissions (gm/bhp-hr) and the expression of oxides of nitrogen as nitric oxide. An unapproved working draft of the Test Procedure is included as an Appendix. 700672. California Requirements for Assembly-Line Test- ing of Vehicle Emissions. A. G. Cattaneo and Frank Bonamassa, California Air Resources Board. California has recently enacted legislation requiring assembly-line emission testing of vehicles for sale in California. The California Air Resources Board has adopted preliminary assembly-line test procedures in accordance with the legislative requirement. The specific purposes and requirements of the program are discussed and progress toward full implementation is reviewed. 700673. Variable Cam Timing as an Emission Control Tool. G. B. Kirby Meacham, Eaton Yale &amp; Towne, Inc. Automatic variation of internal combustion engine valve timing in response to load and speed is an effective technique for reducing emission of oxides of nitrogen and unburned hydrocarbons. The variation employed is cam advance, which causes part of the exhaust gases normally expelled near the end of the exhaust stroke to be retained and mixed with the fresh air-fuel mixture during the following inlet stroke. Part of the unburned hydrocarbons normally emitted are contained in these recirculated end-of-stroke gases, and are oxidized further by re- exposure to combustion. The peak flame temperature is reduced by the diluent, and formation of oxide of nitrogen is suppressed. A prototype vehicle equipped with an automatic cam advance system shows that emissions measured by the Federal Test Procedure are reduced by the following amounts: nitric oxide 64%, unburned hydrocarbons 32%, and carbon monoxide 16.5%. Only minimal changes in vehicle operating charac- teristics are caused, and potential durability is good since the existing engine valves and pistons are used to handle the recirculated exhaust. The cylinder-to-cylinder distri- bution of the diluent is inherently uniform, and the amount of recirculation is repeatable. Discussion: David R. Liimatta, Ethyl Corp-; Author's closure 1970 SAE Transactions 700676. Automotive Markets for Injection Molded Plas- tics in the Seventies. Walter R. Kosy, Marbon Chemical Div., Borg-Warner Corp. Applications for injection molded thermoplastics in automobiles have increased markedly in the last five years. A study of the growth of plastics in the auto industry traces the various factors that have influenced this expansion. The economy of thermoplastics is perhaps the major consideration for their increased used, but more styling flexibility and better performance in specific applications have also helped to promote them into new uses. The entry of the auto industry into the large scale processing of plastics has introduced new concepts, and opened the eyes of auto engineers to the versatility of the injection molding process. Trends in the auto industry indicate that plastic parts will play an increasingly greater role in the design of future vehicles. The demands of the auto safety legis- lation, the costprice squeeze, and competitive pressures are some of the factors influencing these trends. The plastics industry faces a challenge and an opportunity in the auto industry. A forecast of the automotive plastics market for the next five years suggests how the various polymers will fare in this area. 700677. Recent Developments in Automotive Plastic Components. William J. Simpson, Chrysler Corp. Within the past 20 years, the use of plastic components has increased enormously. This paper will outline only a few of the recently developed plastic components, and will illustrate some of the many advances that have been made in using these materials in automotive applications. The use of plastics has progressed so rapidly from the 1950's-1970's, that the automobile industry is now using approximately 100 lb. of plastic per car, as compared to 10 lb per car in the 1950's. Automobile manufacturers are cognizant of the in- creased emphasis of plastics in safety related components, and the advances in technology of plastics and other related materials has contributed to this expanding growth. 700678. Engineering the Performance Car. Hans Mezger, Porsche K. G. Porsche has been engineering performance cars for many years, with careful attention paid to the more specific needs of a well-engineered racing car. Developments originally for racing cars have been of great help in the</page><page sequence="98">700679-700688 preparation of series cars. Development of a desirable racing car involves combining the best of all engineering discoveries, such as weight reduction, engine performance, driveability, comfort, interior design, safety, and so forth. These very same factors are applied to series cars in order to evolve the most satisfactory series car possible. 700679. Design for Product Safety. M. F. Biancardi, Employers Insurance of Wausau. Formal organization and technical considerations for product safety are the best means of eliminating or reducing products liability. The design department and the specific safety methods it uses are highly significant in achieving product safety. Establishing responsibility and accountability for safe design provide motivation and direction. Understanding of the product safety system, as well as application of loss potential analyses, aid safe design. Written documentation of safety analyses and of tests will record findings and aid decision making. 700680. Product Liability Loss Prevention - A Systems Approach. Erhard t C. Koerper, Koerper Engi- neering Associates, Inc. The systems approach toward product liability loss prevention takes into consideration the viewpoints and interests of the various corporate departments. The role of each department, which collectively make up a corporate "cabinet," is examined. The application and benefits of such an approach can be applied to other corporate situations. 700681. The Fire and Explosion Investigator's Role in Product Liability Cases. John Kennedy, John A. Kennedy &amp; Associates, Inc. In discussing the role of the fire and explosion investigator in product liability cases, the author describes the areas of manufacturer's accountability and the determination of cause, origin, and responsibility of an occurrence. Particular emphasis is placed on origin and point of origin to determine why a fire or explosion was caused and whether or not a products liability case exists. 700683. Why a Medium Size Four-Wheel Drive Agri- cultural Tractor? L. K. Davis and D. L. Henderson, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works. Medium size four-wheel drive tractors are becoming popular as farmers strive to increase productivity per man-day. These tractors represent the next step up in horsepower, with only a moderately higher cost per horsepower than available large two-wheel drive tractors. This paper discusses how a four-wheel drive tractor, using two-wheel drive tractor components, minimizes cost. The new John Deere 7020 tractor is used as an example to show how this was accomplished. 700684. Development of White Farm Equipment's Artic- ulated Four- Wheel-Drive Tractor. R. H. Lytle, M. J. Verhulst and R. O. Westra, White Farm Equipment Co. This paper describes the design and development of a new articulated 4-wheel-drive tractor for the agricultural market. The marketing needs and horsepower trends, as well as the problems associated with transmitting this horsepower to the ground, are described. Due to a short project time schedule, the task force approach to project management was utilized. This approach proved to be extremely successful. The design objectives established were based on program and tooling costs and the short engineering program time available. An accelerated test program consisting of selective component testing, min- imum development, and field testing was accomplished. 700685. The Design and Application of Electrical Wiring Harnesses for Farm Machinery. D. R. Dedow, Packard Electric Div., General Motors Corp. Electrical wiring harnesses are most frequently designed as an afterthought. When all other designs are complete and components properly located, the electrical wiring is added. Today, with increased complexity, environmental hazards, buildability, serviceability, and ever increasing labor costs, it is becoming a necessity to plan the wiring system in the early design stages of the vehicle. 700686. The Application of Charging Systems to Farm, Construction, and Industrial Machinery. R. A. Martin, G. R. Renner, G. A. Rowls and G. H. Stenklyft, Delco-Remy Div., General Motors Corp. New developments in charging systems offer improve- ments in performance, life, and reliability when the systems are properly applied to the vehicle. These developments include the Integral Charging System with a built-in integrated-circuit regulator, sealed side terminal battery, an improved application aids. An important objective of these developments is improved battery operation described in terms of the "Happy Battery" concept. 700687. Rubber Wheel Abrasion Test. Frank Borik, Climax Molybdenum Co. of Michigan. A laboratory test was developed to evaluate materials for their resistance to low-stress abrasion. The abrasion is caused by a silica sand slurry conveyed between the specimen and a 7 in. diameter steel wheel, having a neoprene rubber rim, rotating at a speed of 240 rpm. The specimen is pressed against the wheel with a force of 50 lb. The wear test was used to determine and to compare the abrasion resistance of a variety of materials ranging from constructional steels to sintered carbides. The effects of test variables, metallurgical variables, and reproducibility of results are discussed. The test proved to be highly reproducible. 1970 SA E Transactions 700688. The Effect of Carbon Content and Heat Treat- ment on the Rate of Abrasive Wear of Plain 173</page><page sequence="99">700690-700697 174 Carbon Steels. A. C. Quinn and D. W. Hall, Ford Motor Co. The effect of carbon content and hardness on the rate of abrasive wear of plain carbon steels was determined using a wet-sand erosion test machine. The type of abrasion simulated in this device is commonly referred to as "low-stress scratching abrasion." The machine employs a revolving rubber wheel which picks up the abrasive grit and rubs it against the steel specimen with a minimum breakdown of the abrasive grit particles. It has been found for normalized plain carbon steels that the abrasive wear rate decreases as the carbon content increases. The same steels heat-treated by quenching and tempering also show a decreasing wear rate as the carbon content increases. For a given heat-treated steel the wear rate decreases as the hardness increases. The combined data show that the abrasive wear rate of heat-treated steels depends both on their hardness and carbon content. That is, if two steels of different carbon contents are heat treated to the same hardness level, the one with the highest carbon content will have the lowest wear rate. In addition, reasonable correlation appears to exist between data from this laboratory method and field test data on plowshares. 700690. Field and Laboratory Abrasion Tests on Plow- shares. Douglas A. Stolk, Climax Molybdenum Co. of Michigan. A laboratory abrasion test was compared with the abrasion caused by actual soil-tilling to develop a method of evaluating ferrous alloys for agricultural applications requiring wear resistance. The comparison was based on the results obtained from three commercially produced wrought, heat-treated, high carbon steel plowshares and two experimental compositions; one was a cast iron alloyed with 1% chromium and the other was a white cast iron alloyed with 12% chromium and 1% molybdenum. For these widely different types of ferrous alloys, good correlation was found between the relative abrasion resistance determined in the laboratory test and in actual field tests. 700691. High Performance Precleaning System for Heavy Duty Air Cleaning Applications. L. F. Fratzke, Caterpillar Tractor Co. The air cleaning requirements of diesel engines have become more demanding each year. Airflow has in- creased, while the space available for the air cleaning mechanism has remained stable or has been reduced in the search for smaller, more productive machines. In a "dry" type air cleaning system a highly efficient precleaner can reduce the physical size of the package by keeping up to 95% of ingested dust or contaminant from reaching the final filter. Described and illustrated is a heavy duty air cleaning system using a high performance precleaner and its application on a modern track-type tractor. 700693. Recent Improvements in Japanese Farm and Industrial Engines. Shigeo Nagasawa, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. This paper describes the changes we have incorporated in our small engines to make starting easier and to make the engines more reliable. Specifically, the paper describes in detail the development of solid state capacitor discharge systems and the resulting advantages-easy starting and freedom from breaker point problems. It also describes a development in small diesel engines-the adoption of a new double injection system for ante-chamber type diesel engines that makes hand starting easy at temperatures as low as -12 C (10.4 F). The improvements in the stability of the motor start diesel engines and in other performances of engines are described too. 700694. A Low Cost Chain Saw Designed for the Casual User Market. D. L. Dickson, Pioneer Saws Ltd. With the increasing demand for small light weight chain saws for the casual user market, the need for a low cost design to meet this requirement became apparent. By employing several new design concepts and manufacturing methods, a 35% reduction in manufac- turing cost compared with a previous model of approx- imately the same output was achieved. 700695. Industrial Crawler Tractors and Loaders. R. W. Johnson, Inťl. Harvester Co. A new Industrial Crawler Tractor line has been developed by the International Harvester Construction Equipment Division. All of these tractors are in the 50 to 70 hp category. Design parameters are discussed together with descriptions of various assemblies, their functions, and problems associated with their development. 700696. The American Bosch Model 100 Fuel Injection Pump. Ross S. Karlson, Donald E. Valentine and Warren E. Snyder, American Bosch. The Model 100 pump is the latest in the American Bosch family of single plunger pumps. The Model 100 is intended to serve both the present and the future medium horsepower, high speed diesel engine market. New and improved features include a pressure-balanced plunger in the hydraulic head, a new constant phase servo lock internal timing device, and an Oldham plunger drive. The pump includes an excess fuel device for improved starting. Available accessories include an electric or Bowden wire shutoff, single lever control including mechanical shutoff, maniford pressure-actuated smoke limiting device, and tachometer drive take-off provision. 700697. Improved Distributor Pump with Hydraulic Gov- ernor. Gerald Hoefer, Robert Bosch GmbH. A single plunger distributor injection pump with hydraulic governor is described, with particular reference to the working principle of the hydraulic spill-piston governor. This governor functions as a variable speed governor</page><page sequence="100">700698-700705 whose speed-droop characteristics can be adjusted ac- cording to requirements throughout the operating range. The working capacity of the governor is independent of speed so that the lowest no-load speed of the engine is not limited by the govenor. Design features of the improved pump, EP/VA. . .C, are discussed. 700698. The Kugelfischer Distributor Injection Pump PV. W. Gross and O. Bauer, Kugelfischer Georg Schaefer &amp; Co., Germany. A new distributor type diesel fuel injection pump is described. The pump designed for engines up to 8 cyl including 6 cyl engines with unequal firing intervals contains one plunger driven by a face cam. It involves fuel supply pump, speed advance unit, flyweight type all-speed governor, automatic excess-fuel for starting, and a torque control device. Designing details and performance figures are given. 700699. Colt "PRS" - The Versatile Distributor Type Diesel Injection Pump. G. R. Bown, Colt Indus- tries, Inc.; and J. R. Giraudon, S.I.G.M.A. A new heavy duty distributor type diesel fuel injection pump known as type "PRS" has been developed by S.I.G.M.A. in France. Retaining many of the advantages of "in-line" type injection pumps, the "PRS" has exceptional flexibility of application. At the same time, it is simple, compact, lightweight, and durable. This has been achieved prin- cipally by the use of a spill matering system which permits wide variation of the high pressure hydraulic character- istics. The "PRS" is now in quantity production in Europe for engines ranging up to 8 cylinders and 310 bhp. It is also original equipment on one American engine, and application programs are proceeding satisfactorily toward production in the U.S.A. for installation on additional engines. 700701. Control of Diesel Engine Exhaust Noise. Tang Wu, Inťl. Harvester Co. The contribution of exhaust noise to total vehicle noise is identified by isolation and near field techniques. Control of exhaust noise by using the principles of absorptive, reactive, and dispersive mufflers and their combinations is examined. Guidelines are presented to help the engine designer in the selection of mufflers within the design limitations of size, weight, and engine performance loss. 1970 SA E Transactions 700702. Noise and Efficiency of Axial-Flow Fans. J. W. Hummel, University of Maryland.; and J. A. Weber, University of Illinois. A test apparatus was constructed and instrumented for testing tractor engine cooling fans in an environment simulating actual operating conditions. Tests were con- ducted to investigate the influence of the blade pitch angle, blade camber and fan rotational speed on the air delivery performance, the input power requirements, and the sound power radiated. Prediction equations for the pressure coefficient and the power coefficient as functions of the flow coefficient and the blade pitch angle were developed for each level of blade camber. Prediction equations for the overall acoustic parameter as functions of the flow coefficient, Reynolds number and the blade pitch angle were also developed. A comparison of the prediction equations for the pressure coefficient, the power coefficient and the overall acoustic parameter indicated that the efficiency and the range of efficiency decreased as the blade pitch angle increased. High values of the overall acoustic parameter were associated with higher Reynolds numbers and higher blade pitch angles. The comparison procedure should make possible the selection of a tractor radiator cooling fan based on noise production as well as air movement and efficiency. 700703. Sound Level at Operator's Station of Cab and Non-Cab Equipped Tractors. D. E. Walker, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works. This paper discusses the various sound sources that produce the overall sound level at the operator's station. The effect of adding partial and full operator enclosures is also discussed, along with factors affecting sound level inside enclosures. Absorption curves for cab lining materials and decay rates for damping materials are given. 1970 SA E Transactions 700704. Gas Turbines and Dust - The Effectiveness of an Inlet Air Cleaner. George C. Lawrason, South- west Research Institute. Two 60 kw, gas- turbine powered generator sets were operated together in a controlled environment containing 0.005 gm of selected dust per cubic foot of ambient air. One of the sets was equipped with an inertial-type air cleaner, but the other was unprotected. The unprotected set was unable to carry its rated 60 kw load after 6 hr and 50 min of operation; the unit equipped with the intake air cleaner carried its rated load for nearly 132 hr before automatic shutdown occurred. Both turbines were disassembled and inspected after shutdown. Most of the damage was confined to the air inlet housing, diffuser vanes, and turbine nozzles. Damage and dust ingestion parameters are discussed. 700705. Gas Turbine Sand and Dust Effects and Protec- tion Methods. H. D. Connors and J. P. Murphy, Lycoming Div., Avco Corp. The development and application of sand and dust protection devices for the Lycoming gas turbine engine are discussed. A brief history of the erosion problem is given, and solutions such as separators, screens, casing inserts, and coatings are evaluated with regard to their contribution to the extension of engine operating life. 175</page><page sequence="101">700706-700711 176 Engine wear and erosion characteristics are described and field experience with protective devices is presented. 700706. Techniques for Reducing Sand and Dust Erosion in Small Gas Turbine Engines. H. E. Shoemaker and C. P. Shumate, Solar Div., International Harvester Co. The results of an experimental investigation of the nature and characteristics of the effect of dust on the erosion of a small gas turbine engine are presented. From laboratory tests, superior erosion-resistant materials were selected for evaluation in engine tests. These tests have indicated that the service life of the engine can be doubled by the utilization of selected coatings. 700707. Development Testing with Electronic Assistance: Gathering, Processing, and Disseminating Data. Richard T. Bennett and Robert J. Oliver, International Harvester Co. An electronic information system has been devised to minimize problems of communication in the engineering field as they apply to the testing of industrial equipment. The paper describes a communication system that makes use of telemetry for data gathering, magnetic tape and analog computers for data reduction, a single-sheet engineering memo as the input form, and a standardized five-copy print-out specification form that gives a com- plete history of problem areas encountered in the program. 700708. The Formation and Control of Nitric Oxide in a Regenerative Gas Turbine Burner. Walter Cornelius and Wallace R. Wade, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. Two techniques were investigated to reduce the emissions of oxides of nitrogen from a conventional regenerative gas turbine burner that involved only minor changes to the burner configuration and did not impair overall burner and engine performances. These methods were to vary the primary zone equivalence ratio and to shorten the residence time of the gas in the primary zone. Significant reductions in nitric oxide emissions were obtained by applying both methods, singly and in various combina- tions with one another, to the burner of the General Motors GT-309 vehicular regenerative gas turbine. Re- ductions in emissions that were measured on a single burner test facility at simulated engine steady-state conditions were confirmed when operating a GT-309 gas turbine powered vehicle over the HEW passenger car emission test cycle. From these evaluations, a computer simulation program was developed to determine closed cycle true mass HEW emission values for typical gas turbine powered passenger cars. Computed results indi- cate that further changes in current burner design and operating practices will be needed to meet the Federal 1980 target for oxides of nitrogen without sacrificing engine performance and economy. In contrast, burner exhaust emissions of hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide should be of less concern. Discussion: Clayton LaPointe and Weston L. Schultz, Ford Motor Co.; David W. Dawson, Naťl.

John Bell, U.S. Army Mobility Equipment Res. &amp; Dev. Center.; and George Walker, Hovey &amp; Associates Ltd. The development trend in construction machinery has been to produce equipment having a high level of reliability. The dollar loss that occurs when a major piece of equipment breaks down on the job is sufficiently great to justify the cost of providing reliable operation. In the development of the North the need for increased relia- bility is greater than ever. In extreme low temperature conditions as found on the North Slope operation in Alaska, the harshness of the environment places addi- tional stress both on the equipment and the operators. The development of winterization kits for construction and heavy engineering equipment to date has been slow, probably because of a comparatively small market and because the work could be postponed or accomplished by protecting the equipment and operator by temporary means to meet the purpose. The results have not been economical or as efficient as desired but efficient enough to be acceptable. In the past, winterization kits have been developed to meet either a military tactical or nontactical requirement. The difference between a military or a civilian require- ment as far as construction machinery is concerned is not very great. The primary difference is that the civilian requirement is based almost entirely on the economic considerations. This paper deals with the development of winter- ization kits utilizing military experience and developing and testing winterization kits to meet a civilian or nonmilitary requirement using readily available off- the-shelf material and components. 1970 SA E Transactions 700710. Summarization of Construction Equipment. Jacob Gardner, Stolper Industries, Inc. This paper discusses some of the problems encountered in "summerizing" or air conditioning a cab used on con- struction equipment. The environmental conditions of high temperature and high relative humidity combined with severe dust shock and vibration conditions affect the design of components. Components discussed are com- pressors, condensers, evaporator coils, filters, air ducts, air diffusers and heaters. Installation for ease of maintenance and replacement is emphasized. 700711. Quieting Hydraulic Systems and Components. Ronald J. Becker, Vickers Inc. The noise generated in a hydraulic system occurs in three</page><page sequence="102">700712-700719 forms: audible sound, structural vibration, and fluid pressure pulsations. The selection of quiet pumps, al- though an important step, does not necessarily quiet the operating system. The elimination of entrained air in the system fluid may not remove the problem. Frequently, a tradeoff of operating parameters in a pump or motor is the best means of noise control. Installation practices are important and may require isolation of the pump or motor assembly from the rest of the machine structure. 700712. Essential Considerations Involved in Hydraulic Component Noise. J. R. McBurnett, E. C. Fitch, Jr. and R. L. Lowery, Oklahoma State Univer- sity. This paper presents a comprehensive treatment of the essential considerations involved in measuring the noise- generating characteristics of hydraulic components. The need for the reduction of noise levels for all types of hydraulic machinery is discussed from the manufacturer's point of view. The mechanical and fluid dynamic aspects associated with hydraulic components which create undesirable and damaging noise levels are described. Special emphasis is placed on quantitative methods for establishing and comparing noise levels of operating hydraulic components. A cursory review of the necessary facility requirements and measuring techniques is included. 1970 SA E Transactions 700714. Legislative Factors of Noise - Meeting the Occupational Noise Regulations of the U.S. Department of Labor. Robert D. Gidel, U.S. Department of Labor. The paper is a discussion of the limiting of noise and noise-related safety hazards in industry. There are presently four federal laws in effect, designed to protect occupational safety. A fifth law is being considered by Congress which, if passed, should provide additional noise control. The U.S. Department of Labor has promulgated regulations to limit and control noise. The details of the regulations - such as sound levels, varied forms of noise, control measures, and protective equipment - are dis- cussed. 700716. A New Method of Calculating Plain Bearings of Statically Indeterminate Crankshafts. Eglof von Schnurbein, Motoren- und Turbinen-Union Friedrichshafen GmbH. The calculation of the instationary loaded bearings of crankshafts presumes knowledge of the bearing forces. The standard methods for the calculation of the main bearing forces for multiple (that is, statically indeter- minate) supported crankshafts are based on considerably simplified assumptions. Thus the results of the calcu- lations are not representative of actual working forces. The new, improved method presented here considers the crankshaft as a straight beam on plain bearings. With this system, the forces and dislocations of all bearings influence each other, since the distribution of the operational forces over the individual bearings depends on the crankshaft deformation and therefore on each journal within the bearing. Therefore the forces and dislocations are matched to each other by iteration. A comparison of calculation results with measurements shows a substantial improvement over the methods commonly used. 1970 SA E Transactions 700717. Relationship Between Oil Film Thickness and Wear of Journal Bearings. Andreas Gervé, Lehrstuhl und Institut für Maschinenkon struktionslehre und Kraftfahrzeugbau.; Gustav Katzenmeier, Lehrstuhl und Institut für Maschinenkon struktionslehre und Kraft- hafrzeugbau.; and Karl Kollmann, Universität Karlsruhe, Germany. Lubrication of moving parts becomes less efficient in those areas where close fit limits the amount of lubricant to a very thin oil film. Journal bearings are particularly vulnerable in this respect. To test the degree of wear, a radioisotope technique was applied in which shafts and bearings were deuteron activated. Not only did the tests prove sufficiently sensitive to determine the full range of hydrodynamic lubrication, but they also identified the transition point at which poor lubrication caused journal- bearing wear. It was also found that materials of the shaft and bearings greatly influenced the amount of wear. 700718. Theoretical Investigations into Plain Bearings with Gap Geometry Under Dynamic Load. G. Schaffrath, Siemens, A. G. The development of reliable plain bearings requires a great deal of preliminary information about their working conditions. Even though theories of dynamically loaded bearings have had significant success in design appli- cation, some doubt remains as to whether bearing reliability calculated in this way can be accepted with confidence. This paper introduces theoretical methods of applying to plain bearing calculations the shaft dis- placement curves derived from hydrodynamic principles, which take into consideration the effects of axial grooves and arbitrary gap geometries. The calculations presented here show that these measured displacement curves are more closely related to design reliability requirements for full journal bearings with circular gap geometries. 700719. Investigation of the Dynamic Behavior of an Asymmetrically Situated Balanced Rotor Sup- ported on Two Arbitrary Journal Bearings. B. Kanaka Raju, Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute, India. Many authors have investigated the problem of instability and critical speeds of a rotor, supported symmetrically between two identical journal bearings. The present investigation extends this work to a rotor situated at any location either in between or outside the two bearings and 177</page><page sequence="103">700720-700726 178 the bearings themselves can be of different geometry and dimensions. Such an investigation will be of more practical importance, as many rotor bearing systems in actual use do not conform to the idealized symmetric system. 700720. Application of Air Bearings to High-Speed Turbomachinery. M. A. Barnett and A. Silver, AiResearch Manufacturing Co. The idea of long-life turbomachinery that requires no oil or servicing is immediately attractive. The concept of air-lubricated bearings provides the basis for such a design. This paper describes the advantages and problems in the application of air bearings to closed- and open-cycle machinery. It discusses the design and performance characteristics of several prototype air bearing machines. The results of extensive ground tests and thousands of hours of field experience prove that practical air bearing turbomachines for open-cycle applications are a reality. 700721. Reservoir Design as Viewed by a Pump Manu- facturer. James M. Eley, Tyrone Hydraulics, Inc. This paper provides information that will assist in hydraulic reservoir design. Basic rules are given for practices to be followed and practices to be strictly avoided. Examples of pump failures caused by improper reservoir design are shown. Recommended procedures for evaluating designs are given. 700722. Reservoir Design for Mobile Equipment Hy- draulic Circuits. Edward A. Wirtz, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Hydraulic reservoir design for implement and steering circuits on track and wheel loaders plays a very important role in the performance of these circuits. A reservoir provides air and oil for all the circuit requirements and enables entrained air to separate from the oil. In addition, a reservoir has considerable potential as an efficient heat exchanger. Good reservoir design should be aimed toward adequate air and oil capacity and the most desirable oil circulation to reduce heat build-up and minimize aeration for longer pump life. Accessibility for convenient services is a result of good planning and careful selection of the reservoir's location on the vehicle. To achieve the best possible reservoir, all of the aforementioned facts must be kept uppermost in the design engineer's mind from the start of the initial design through field evaluation and final design for production. 700723. Optimization of the Tractive Performance of Four-Wheel-Drive Off-Road Vehicles. Jo-Yung Wong, Carleton University. In this paper, the basic tractive characteristics and the optimization of the performance of four-wheel-drive off-road vehicles are analyzed from the point of view of tractive efficiency. It is found that the distribution of thrust and slip between the front and rear wheels has considerable effect on the efficiency of operation. Differences in theoretical speed and the type of coupling between the front and rear axles generally effect the thrust and slip distribution. It is shown that the optimum thrust distribution is that which can make the slips of the front and rear wheels equal. Only under such circumstances will the tractive efficiency of a four-wheel-drive vehicle be a maximum. This requires that the thrust distribution should vary with the weight distribution of the vehicle as well as terrain and other conditions. It is pointed out that the inefficient distribution of thrust and slip also causes excessive tire wear. The analysis indicates that the development of a new type of interaxle coupling which can provide the optimum distribution of thrust and slip between driven axles is of practical importance. 1970 SA E Transactions 700724. Concepts and Applications of Interaxle Differ- entials. Jerry L. Hart, Detroit Automotive Prod- ucts. For years now, differentials have been used in both on and off highway vehicles, of the single or multidrive axle varieties. The vast majority of differential applications have been in the axle itself. Recently, there has been a trend in the application and use of interaxle differentials in multidrive axle vehicles. This paper will discuss the concepts and applications of interaxle differentials in both on and off highway vehicles. Detroit Automotive Products believes there is a definite design trend for interaxle differentials and overrunning clutches in the more sophisticated on and off highway vehicles currently being developed. 700725. Design and Performance Characteristics of White Construction Equipment Four-Wheel Drive Self Propelled Vehicles. P. E. Lockie and J. D. Wormley, White Construction Equipment. Movement power is of great essence to push vehicles carrying equipment and materials in today's many heavy-duty operations. The increased improvements in 4-wheel versus 2-wheel drive is much more satisfactory from all aspects for front mounted equipment. The advantages of 4-wheel drive in the areas of mobility, efficiency, maneuverability, serviceability, etc., promises to play a major part in the acceleration of engine power. 700726. Hydraulic Hoist Units for Cranes. S. G. Christison, Gearmatic Co. Ltd. This paper deals with hydraulic hoists used in an "open loop" hydraulic system, operated by a control valve having the work ports open to tank in neutral. The hoists discussed employ spur gear reductions and antifriction journal bearings throughout. Factors to be considered in the selection of the hydraulic motor and control valve for a hydraulic hoist</page><page sequence="104">700727-700734 are discussed and apply to all hoists used in an "open loop" system. A basis for establishing the rated capacity of a hydraulic hoist is suggested and can be used for any type of hydraulic hoist. 700727. Planetary Two-Speed, Automatic Brake Concept for Winch Drives. Jack T. Shaffer, Vickers Tulsa Div., Sperry Rand Corp. Two disc type clutch packs serve a dual purpose in the TULSA two-speed planetary winch drive. In the driving mode of operation either high or low clutch is hy- draulically selected to transmit power to the planetary system. In the "holding" or stopped mode of operation, the high and low clutch packs interact automatically by spring force to provide a static brake. Either one of two mechanical power flow routes through a planetary system is hydraulically selected to obtain the two-speed opera- tion. When the two power flow routes are simultaneously restrained from rotation a lock-up of the planetary reduction is effected to provide the static load brake. Dynamic braking is provided by a counterbalance valve in the hydraulic system. This paper discusses the detailed operation and basic design elements involved in developing the patented two-speed planetary transmission. 700728. Boom Mounted Construction Hoist. E. W. Turnquist, Braden Industries, Inc. This paper is a discussion of hydraulically driven, remote controlled construction hoists suitable for mounting on hydraulically extendable booms. Various types of gear reductions, multiple speeds, brake systems, free fall apparatus, remote control methods for the free fall, and hydraulic motors are covered giving the advantages and disadvantages of each of the various systems. 700729. Unusual Problems in Earthmoving Equipment Gearing. LeRoy A. Grotto, International Har- vester Co. This paper discusses the type of problems encountered in the design and application of gears in earthmoving machines and their powerplants in which the usual design approaches were of little help. In all the cases discussed, a test program was necessary to understand the phenom- enon as these were associated with the dynamics of the systems and assemblies involved. Once the test results were analyzed and the dynamics understood, the solutions to the problems were readily apparent. 700730. Design Parameters for Automated Bearing Set- tings. R. W. Cameron and A. J. Jenkins, The Timken Co. Automated bearing setting techniques have been de- veloped to insure economy and reliability with regard to the assembly and setting of tapered roller bearings in a wide variety of machinery and equipment. The appli- cation of these concepts is designed to minimize or eliminate the human variable of judgment and skill during the assembly operation. The full effectiveness of these concepts can be utilized only if machinery is properly designed to accommodate these methods. Emphasis will be placed on design considerations to achieve this end. Various setting tech- niques will be presented that are currently being used successfully on a production basis. 700731. Crash Trucks "90 Seconds from Death". Jackson Medley and Robert Hardt, Oshkosh Truck Corp. Aircraft crash fires and the high performance truck design characteristics required to fight them are discussed. Power-to-weight ratios as low as 75 lb/hp enable these unique crash rescue vehicles to attack and blanket an aircraft crash fire with up to 6000 gal of expanded foam/min. To insure high levels of reliability for such life saving vehicles, very rigorous Aberdeen Proving Ground Test Programs were performed and are discussed, along with the disclosure of the planning and scheduling required for on-time contract completion. 700732. A Rationale for Electric Drive Trains for Heavy- Duty Vehicles. D. J. Roesler and A. L. Jokl, U.S. Army Mobility Equipment Res. &amp; Dev. Center. This paper summarizes a study of the applicability of electric drive trains to heavy-duty vehicles, with emphasis on military use. Presently used power transmission systems are compared with electrical systems considering design, performance, and maintenance factors. The comparison is supplemented by a cost-effectiveness analysis using mining, manufacturing, and military vehicle data. It is concluded that feasibility of electric propulsion systems for heavy-duty applications has been well estab- lished; that d-c systems are cost effective, a-c systems are potentially cost effective; further, that the time is ripe for development programs on a-c drives to reach operational availability in the late seventies. 700734. Reducing Hydrocarbons and Odor in Diesel Exhaust by Fuel Injector Design. H. S. Ford, D. F. Merrion and R. J. Hames, Detroit Diesel Engine Div., GMC. Exhaust hydrocarbons and odor were reduced in Detroit Diesel Series "71" engines by revising the fuel injector tip design. Five injector tips were investigated which had different volumes of uncontrolled fuel below the injector valve. Results are presented to show that exhaust hydrocarbons and odor can be substantially reduced by minimizing the uncontrolled volume of fuel in the injector tip. The hydrocarbon emissions are attributed to uncon- trolled fuel being pushed from the tip by expansion of the fuel at elevated temperatures. This conclusion is sup- ported by test results with fuels having different 10% distillation temperatures. 179</page><page sequence="105">700736-700751 180 700736. The Effects of Emulsified Fuels and Water Induction on Diesel Combustion. E. Valdmanis and E. E. Wulfhorst, Cummins Engine Co. Water was inducted with the intake air and injected emulsified with the fuel, in a conventional single cylinder D. I. diesel engine. The major effects of inducted water were an increase in ignition delay, and reduction in the oxides of nitrogen and smoke at a constant fuel/air ratio. When the water was emulsified with the fuel, the ignition delay increased so much that no benefits were obtained except for a reduction in smoke. The results are compared to a similar study on an engine with the "M" combustion system. The major differences between the results obtained with the two combustion systems are attributed to the differences in the ignition delay caused by the water addition. 700738. Elastomeric Suspensions with Geometric Spring Rates for Off-Highway Vehicles. James E. McClelland, Unit Rig &amp; Equipment Co. This paper describes an off-highway vehicle suspension using modular elastomer-bonded-to-metal impact cushioning pads. The modular impact pads are stacked inside telescoping struts which are connected between the axle and the frame. The rheology of the elastomer and the cross-sectional shape of the pads give a geometric load versus deflection curve, a near-linear spring rate versus load curve, and a near-constant frequency at any level of load. These characteristics limit excessive deflections and increase the stability and controllability of the vehicle. The modular impact pads are self-damping, dissipating a large percentage of the applied energy, and require no auxiliary shock absorbers. A wide range of spring functions and damping functions is possible by the utilization of different elastomers, pad shapes, pad sizes, and numbers of pads. Initial cost and weight are less than for conventional springs and struts. Maintenance costs are negligible, and service lives of more than 25,000 operating hours have been recorded between overhauls. 1970 SAE Transactions 700740. The Case RPS 34 Power Shift Transmission and Its Controls. J. Lemke and J. C. Rigney, J. I. Case Co. The previously used concept of a power shift transmission coupled with a manual transmission has been carried to completion in the Case RPS 34 transmission. Design limitations caused by retaining the basic housing dimen- sions of the standard manual transmission and the tractor hydraulic circuitry of the non-power transmission were encountered and resolved with a unique control valve design and a compact power shift package.

Wellman Div., Abex Corp. Performance parameters for application of sintered metallic and heat-resistant carbon friction facings to oil cooled clutches for heavy duty service vehicles are presented. Design factors to improve performance and durability of opposing discs are discussed. Future re- quirements for increased energy absorption beyond capability of currently available friction material is anticipated and reinforced TFE material is proposed to satisfy these requirements. 700742. Drivelines for High Performance. Charles W. Haines, Dana Corp. There has been considerable published data on appli- cation factors and theory of Cardan type universal joints. Significant improvement in product performance can also be obtained through design innovations of component parts. This paper shows how several development pro- grams involving design and material have generated higher performance from universal joints. Product devel- opment directed toward meeting industry requirements over the next ten years and new areas of application are also examined. 700750. Nondestructive Testing of Graphite Fiber Com- posite Structures. D. Hagemaier, H. J. McFaul and D. Moon, McDonnell Douglas Corp. The paper discusses nondestructive testing (NDT) meth- ods and techniques for detection of material and manu- facturing anomalies in state-of-the-art graphite compos- ites. Introduction of composites into large-scale produc- tion depends in large measure on the successful appli- cation of NDT for process control and monitoring. Visual, liquid-penetrant, radiographic, ultrasonic, sonic, thermal, and acoustic-emission NDT methods are used to evaluate graphite fiber composite aircraft specimens and structures. Reference standards are fabricated with built-in dis- continuities, commensurate with each structural article fabricated. The test specimens and parts were tested by various methods in order to determine optimum discon- tinuity detection. Tests were conducted on research and development graphite composite aircraft structures con- sisting of molded graphite flap ribs, graphite composite flap assembly, and graphite composite horizontal stabi- lizer assembly. 700751. Matched-Die Compression Molding of Advanced Composite Structures. Louis W. Toth, Goodyear Aerospace Corp. Matched-die compression molding has been developed to form structural components with complex shapes from advanced composite materials. Development programs have progressed from problem identification through material systems characterization, design, fabrication, and test validation. The molding process is described, prop-</page><page sequence="106">700752-700756 erties of compression-molded composite materials are discussed, and results of testing to date are presented. 700752. Metal Matrix Composite Structures Tooling and Fabrication Processes. M. D. Weisinger, Convair Div., General Dynamics Corp. An extensive secondary fabrication program was con- ducted in aluminum-boron composite material under both contract and independent research and development funding. Forming, joining, and machining of diffusion- bonded sheet material was investigated during the fab- rication and final assembly of a full-sized missile payload adapter. Brake bending was done at room and elevated temperatures with the filaments in various orientations. Stretch forming was attempted. The minimum radius of bend of roll formed sheet was established. Joining studies included mechanical fastening at various thicknesses and orientations. Fusion welding was unsatisfactory due to the melting of the filaments. Resistance spot welding was highly successful and good weld strengths and properties were obtained. Machining of composites was done with diamond tools. Chipless methods proved satisfactory with such processes as electrodischarge and ultrasonic ma- chining. Tape consolidation by both high-pressure bond- ing and low-pressure braze bonding was used to produce tubes, I-beam, and angles from aluminum boron. Me- chanical tests proved the high strength of the composite shapes. Recent investigations include methods of increasing transverse strength such as stainless steel wire, titanium- backed tape, and heat treatment of matrix. Some of these investigations are summarized and recent developments in secondary fabrication and autoclave technology are discussed in detail. The current state-of-the-art in alu- minum-boron processing is discussed along with advan- tages and disadvantages. 1970 SA E Transactions 700753. Manufacturing the Tektite Habitat. C. M. Lorenz and R. D. Cockfield, General Electric Co. Tektite was manufactured by the General Electric Com- pany in conjunction with the Office of Naval Research, Department of Interior, NASA, and other governmental, industrial and academic organizations. It was manufac- tured to house four marine scientists for a 60-day period on the ocean floor at a 50 ft depth at an isolated site in the Virgin Islands. The habitat and associated surface equip- ment provided for life support, environmental control, communications, surface monitoring, safety, and comfort of the four aquanauts. The Tektite I experiment was completed safely within minutes of the time scheduled many months previously. The habitat was returned to General Electric in Phila- delphia, where it was refurbished for the Tektite I mission. This mission is currently in progress in the Virgin Islands and is due to be completed in early November 1970. 700754. The Fabrication and Assembly of the Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle. James M, Corn- stock, Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. The Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle (DSRV) repre- sents a challenge in advancement of materials and undersea technology. The unique mission of the DSRV requires the submersible to be transported by air within a C-141 aircraft; this unusual transport mode gives rise to the need for aerospace techniques of weight reduction and control. The DSRV was launched Jan. 24, 1970 at the Lockheed Ocean Laboratory, San Diego, which culmi- nated over 3-1/2 years of work by the Ocean Systems Organization of Lockheed. 700755. The Space Station; A Fundamental Element of the Integrated Space Program. W. G. Huber and D. C. Cramblit, Marshall Space Flight Center, NASA. This paper includes a brief look at the present space station program for the early 1970s, a broad overview of future earth orbital mission goals and objectives, and a review of the approach being taken in evolving a "common module" space station concept responsive to these future program requirements. Design requirements pertinent to all future space stations and alternate space station concepts are briefly described. A generic space station concept is discussed in terms of its role within the total integrated program of the 1970s and its advanced applications. The feasibility of achieving a "common module" design suitable to alternate mission applications is analyzed. It is concluded that essential commonality and modularity features can be incorporated into the basic design approach to future space stations that will permit their multipurpose application to a wide variety of missions. 1970 SA E Transactions 700756. Space Station Design. Rene A. Berglund and Jack C. Heberlig, NASA Manned Spacecraft Center. This paper is a brief review of the background of space station design effort from the time manned space flight was initiated to the present. The existing technology base for implementation of an ambitious earth-orbital opera- tions program is briefly commented upon. Current space station designs are discussed in the light of present performance requirements. Also presented are some of the launch vehicles considered as candidates for the future. This paper reviews the design impact of accommodating many useful experiments and earth-related applications and of obtaining a space station lifetime of up to 10 Years with onboard maintenance and repair activities. The necessity of management involvement on the part of many Government and private organizations is discussed, and some practical techniques which can be used to accom- modate this involvement are presented. 1970 SA E Transactions 181</page><page sequence="107">700757-700771 182 700757. Space Station Operations and Logistics. R. E. Holmen, F. P. Bannon and J. C. McHaffie, McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co. The 10-year duration of the proposed Space Station Program presents a new challenge to logistics in that unlike previous space programs whose logistics support function were essentially completed at liftoff, the 4rpace Station's logistics support will just be beginning. A Logistics Support Element will have the key role of: planning, delivery, and return of Space Station crew and supplies; performing this function in conjunction with inventory control and configuration management; and coordination/integration of new hardware and experi- ment end items. Total Space Station operations and logistics support, including the interface to the Space Shuttle which provides the logistics vehicle function, are discussed. 1970 SAE Transactions 700758. Research Capabilities. G. A. Keller, Marshall Space Flight Center, NASA. The paper very briefly describes certain fundamental characteristics of the earth-orbital environment which make a manned space station attractive for research in sciences and engineering. Descriptions are given only for selected features that are both unique and important: agravie force field, hard vacuum, cosmic radiation, and spatial disposition. Description of facilities, equipment, general purpose laboratories, and experimental hardware is left to other authors or to other media, including referenced studies. Several references are given. These in turn will provide the interested reader with comprehensive information and further references in depth. 700759. Applications Technology Satellites F and G. H. Gerwin, National Aeronautics and Space Agen- cy.; and C. Robinson, General Electric Co. A brief description of the NASA Applications Technology Satellite Program and the basic design features of the ATS F and G spacecraft, the latest in the series, is presented. The Applications Technology Satellites F and G will be geostationary platforms for conducting a number of communication technology experiments. The main feature of these spacecraft is a 30-ft parabolic déployable antenna which can be precisely pointed (0.1 deg). Descriptions of the technology experiments planned for ATS-F are included to illustrate some of the objectives of the ATS program. 700760. The Use of Space Systems to Support the Growth of International Air Transportation. E. J. Martin, Communications Satellite Corp. Jumbo jets have entered service, soon to be joined by supersonic transports. Present communications facilities serving over-ocean enroute traffic are already reaching saturation in some areas and a clear need exists to improve the quality, reliability and capacity of air/ground communications for the traffic of the 1970's. This paper discusses the nature and magnitude of the anticipated air traffic and operational control require- ments and alternative concepts involving space systems and major factors related to planning and the imple- mentation of these plans. 1970 SAE Transactions 700761. The Earth Resources Technology Satellites (ERTS) System. W. E. Scull and T. M. Ragland, Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA. This paper describes the Earth Resources Technology Satellites which are part of an experimental program to provide data pertaining to: agriculture, geology, hy- drology, geography, cartography, and oceanography. The primary objective of the ERTS mission is to obtain high-resolution multispectral images of the earth's surface over a period of one year. This program has already been implemented, with the launch of ERTS-A scheduled for March 1972. 700763. Economic and Design Considerations in Deriving a Universal Space Vehicle Complementing the Space Shuttle. C. F. Peters and W. A. Roberts, Convair Div., General Dynamics Corp. The design requirements of an Orbit-to-Orbit Shuttle (OOS) are dictated by both performance and interface considerations with other elements of the Space Trans- portation System. In order to achieve a stage that has universal application, all design requirements must be carefully evaluated. A stage designed to accommodate the lunar landing requirements has marginal capability for per- forming the unmanned high-energy earth orbital missions, as the incorporation of interface and kit provisions have a tendency to degrade the stage mass fraction. The early incorporation of a high-mass fraction OOS to phase-in with the development of the Space Shuttle will result in substantial savings in the national space program. 700768. Space Shuttle Structural Design Concepts and Fabrication Problems. R. A. Lusk, Space Div., North American Rockwell Corp. One of the next steps in man's exploration of space is the development of a reusable space system capable of transporting men and equipment to near-earth orbits and returning them safely to earth. NASA's Space Shuttle Program is designed to achieve this goal in the 1970s, with a reusable space orbiter and a reusable booster. This paper identifies the structural problems inherent in these craft and discusses the structural details of the orbiter design being studied by North American Rockwell's Space Division. In this Phase B study, which is being conducted under contract for NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center, cost is accorded primary consideration in all technical trade-offs. 700771. Development of Nonmetallic External Insulation Thermal Protection Systems for Space Shuttle.</page><page sequence="108">700772-700780 Paul D. Gorsuch, Richard C. Tanzilli, Dwight E. Florence and R. Gluck, General Electric Co. Recently completed design studies for launch vehicle- orbiter space transportation systems have indicated that the payload weight fractions are extremely small. These studies have also identified the vehicle structures and thermal protection systems as areas of high weight-saving potential since their combined weights may be equal to or greater than the payloads. Thermal protection systems, based on rigid and reusable ceramic insulation materials and on reinforced oxidation resistant or inhibited carbon- carbon composites, offer potential for greatly increasing the payload weight fractions. These types of materials are now undergoing extensive development, and it is the purpose of this paper to describe their properties and characteristics, to summarize the progress being made in optimizing their properties and/or uniformity and relia- bility for shuttle vehicle applications, to present some prototype thermal protection system panel designs uti- lizing these materials, and to make cost and weight comparisons with other candidate systems. 1970 SA E Transactions 700772. Cost/Design Performance Management. R. E. Carroll, Space Div., North American Rockwell Corp. The Space Div. of North American Rockwell has developed a system of cost/design performance man- agement, which ensures that cost is given primary consideration in all design activities during the system- definition phase of large, complex aerospace programs. This management tool incorporates the cost-objective approach to define a program that is cost-effective. Both the concept and its implementation are described in this paper. 700773. Designing for Deep-Ocean Hydraulics. D. J. Gugliotti, Westinghouse Electric Corp. Techniques are becoming available which will allow man to exploit the ocean with hydraulic power. Hydraulics has seized its place as the primary energy transfer system in deep-ocean vehicles and systems. To name a few, successful applications include vehicle propulsion, com- plex manipulator systems, coring devices, underwater tools, and many others. Due to the newness and size of this market, the designer is aware that very few manufacturers produce components designed or suitable for underseas operation. However, it is the fond hope that component vendors will commence to provide the designer with his required needs. 700774. Fluid Systems in Deep Submersibles. Robert Schafer, Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. Because of severe environmental conditions, the deep submersible systems design engineer is faced with many challenging problems. Fluids are affected by varying pressures as well as temperature changes; seawater causes accelerated corrosion and contains many substances which can cause severe contamination problems in systems and systems components. Much progress has been made in recent years in the design of lightweight, compact corrosion-resistant components, but the road is long and the end is not yet in sight. 700776. A Submersible Work Chamber for Subsea Pro- duction Systems. Raymond W. Walker, Deep Oil Technology, Inc. To enable man to effectively install and maintain the components of a subsea oil production system at any depth has required the abandonment of conventional diving equipment and techniques. The submersible work chamber and its associated components enable two operators to descend to the sea floor installation with the capability of performing specific tasks. These tasks have been substantially simplified by departing from the use of conventional connector attachments and their associated operating equipment. Problems encountered in making pipeline connections, hydraulic connections, and electrical connections underwater have been combined and solved by the design and construction of a single hydraulic tool operating in conjunction with the submersible work chamber. 700777. Lockseal for Thrust Vector Control of Rocket Motors. D. R. Moody, Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. A new method for controlling the thrust vector of large solid propellant rocket motors has been developed. The key element of this approach to TVC is the Lockseal, a flexible joint that allows motion of the nozzle relative to the motor case. In comparison to the torques required for other types of solid motor movable nozzles, the torques required to flex the Lockseal joint are low and well defined. This paper describes the basic Lockseal from the user's standpoint. Included are details of construction, operating characteristics, and tradeoff considerations. A comparison between Lockseal and secondary injection TVC is in- cluded. 700778. New Missile Control Applications for the Directed Jet Valve. R. H. McFall, Bendix Res. Labs. A single-stage warm gas-directed jet valve has been developed for missile attitude control applications. This concept is projected for servovalve and auxiliary power unit (APU) power control applications. The design features and performance characteristics of the attitude control valve and a two-stage warm gas jet pipe servovalve are presented. The design features of the single-stage directed jet servovalve for warm and cold gas operation are also discussed. 700780. Compatibility of Warm Gas Reaction Controls with Solid Propellant Exhaust Product Used on 183</page><page sequence="109">700781-700788 184 Ballistic Missiles. Sheldon Hyman, Philco-Ford Corp. A family of attitude controls has been developed using 2200 F gas from solid propellants to provide proportional reaction control thrusts of 13-125 lb, operating for durations from 1 to 10 minutes in a PDM (Pulse Duration Modulation) mode at 12-1/2 to 25 Hz with inlet pressures of 400 to 2800 psi. Operation in a solid propellant exhaust gas environment requires that condensible and particulate contaminants be accommodated without degrading per- formance. The exhaustive development program per- formed to successfully achieve contamination isolation is discussed. 700781. Design Criteria for Spacecraft Fluid/Mechanical Systems. James T. Hudson, Martin Marietta Corp. This paper emphasizes the requirements peculiar to spacecraft fluid mechanical systems. Although the design requirements for the fluid power systems used in aircraft, tactical missiles and launch vehicles have been established successfully, criteria for the design of gaseous and liquid systems in spacecraft demand additional considerations. Elements of fluid and mechanical systems in manned and unmanned spacecraft are discussed, and additional visi- bility is provided for those design requirements that differ from earth-oriented vehicles. Of particular interest are the newest spacecraft under design - the space shuttle (a recoverable booster and orbiter) and Viking. The material suggests new design criteria with special considerations for fluid systems and other operating mechanisms exposed to a space environment. It is anticipated that such topics as environment, materials, lubrication, zero gravity and inflight maintenance, are related to the design of fluid and mechanical systems, will generate new interest among members of the SAE-A6. 700783. A New Reaction Control Approach for Sounding Rockets. T. S. Honda and W. L. Keltz, General Electric Co.; and E. A. Gabris and J. P. Murphy, Ames Research Center, NASA. This paper concerns a new technique designed to provide high performance reaction control systems for sounding rockets. Proportional control of differential thrust and simple adaptive control of thrust magnitude (based on the level of demanded thrust) is utilized. The control is being implemented with a combination of electronic and fluidic components for an Aerobee 150 sounding rocket payload whose goal is a pointing stability of 0.1 arc second. 700784. New Developments in Fluidics for Aircraft High- Pressure Hydraulic System Applications. David H. Smith and Royce F. Church, The Boeing Co. The new technology of hydraulic fluidics has been applied to the control of aircraft hydraulic systems in three areas: hydraulic circuit damage isolation, control column arti- ficial feel computation, and the sequencing of landing gear motion. Successful development is demonstrated, and hydarulic fluids are shown to produce considerable improvements to hardware in specific instances. 700785. A Fluidically-Augmented Artificial Feel System for High Performance Aircraft. Tor W. Jansen and Walter W. Kaniuka, Aero Mechanics Dept., Naval Air Development Center. Of the several types of pitch axis artificial feel systems currently in use in fighter and attack aircraft the most common is bobweight, spring, and viscous damper type, and variations on it. The current project of NAVAIRDEVCEN is to augment and improve this type of feel system through the use of fluidic devices. Such augmentation will improve the handling qualities of aircraft by reducing variations in stock force for a given maneuvering response; will reduce the weight and inertia of the feel system; will permit tailoring of the feel system performance over the flight envelope. 700786. A Fluidically Controlled Aircraft Fuel Transfer System. R. W. McGregor, LTV Aerospace Corp. Traditional methods of electrical sensing and control in jet aircraft fuel transfer systems have proven expensive, hard to maintain, and sometimes unreliable. This paper presents a new concept in fuel sensing and control using fluidics. The objective was to construct a general three- tank model system for exploring concept feasibility. Although a single medium (fuel) approach was sought, the interim model used a penumatic logic and sensing system for fuel control. The laboratory model effectively dem- onstrated fuel level control, diversion of fuel transfer at the command of an automatic logic system, and pilot override. A trade study showed gains in reliability and maintainability over the current method of aircraft fuel transfer control. Advantages were: no dependence on electric or hydraulic power, ease of maintenance, and fail-safe operation. 700788. Experimental Investigation of a High-Pressure Hydraulic Fluidic Vortex Rate Sensor. Michael J. DeSantis and Edward L. Rakowsky, Singer- General Precision, Inc. An experimental investigation was conducted to deter- mine the feasibility of a high-pressure (4000 psig) hydraulic fluidic vortex rate sensor. The impetus for this investigation stems from the expanding implementation of fluidics in aircraft, ground vehicle, and helicopter con- trols. The feasibility of a fluidic stabilization system for low-pressure pneumatic/hydraulic operation has been demonstrated (1)*. In such a system, the vehicle's angular rate is sensed by a low-pressure fluidic vortex rate sensor. Greater overall system simplicity can be achieved by direct utilization of the high-pressure hydraulic fluid from the helicopter's primary hydromechanical system. The objective of this program was to investigate the vortex rate sensor for operation with high-pressure hydraulic fluid. To accomplish this objective, a variable-geometry rate sensor was designed, fabricated, and tested. Blocked-</page><page sequence="110">700789-700792 output signal pressures were obtained over a 100-4000 psig, respectively, for supply flow rates of 0.5-3 gpm of mil-H-5606 oil and over an input angular rate range of ±50 deg/sec. Data are presented for these operating conditions using different internal geometries. A com- bination of a vortex chamber diameter and vortex chamber height was found for which the output signal pressure was a maximum. Output signal pressure-flow characteristics were obtained at 4000 psig fluid pressure and 0.5 gpm supply flow rate. From this investigation, it was concluded that vortex rate sensor operation is feasible at very high (4000 psig) hydraulic fluid pressures over a wide range of temper- atures. 700789. Future Airplane Hydraulic Distribution System Design Developments and Testing Criteria. R. W. Mutzke, W. G. Nelson and J. H. van der Velden, The Boeing Co. The latest tubing, fitting, and flexible line designs as well as the testing techniques presently used on production airplane hydraulic distribution system is reviewed in this paper. Designs and materials that are being considered for future airplanes as well as their advantages are presented here in terms of weight and cost. Other major trade parameters such as reliability and maintainability are also considered along with the most significant of all distri- bution system areas requiring improvement - the instal- lation criteria and techniques. Advanced tensile, impulse, and flexure testing tech- niques are evaluated and compared with actual airplane combined load environments encountered by hydraulic systems on large jet aircraft. Based on extensive analyses, an advanced all-welded approach and a conventional distribution system were fabricated and combined environment tested, as indi- vidual systems, to the most severe flight environments for the life of the airplane on an accelerated basis. Results of the system test program and separate tests conducted per Military specification are reviewed in detail. Noted are the vast differences between the combined stress levels measured using the two testing techniques. Maximum combined stress levels measured in the simulated airplane systems only reached one-third of those actually required if the systems were tested per Military specification. Investigation showed that installation practices tended to explain why excessive stresses and/or wear conditions caused tube failures in service in spite of the fact that the connections had already passed Military specification requirements. Whether or not the resultant installation build-in stress levels were excessive only tends to point out the limited applicability of the present specification techniques; and given another reason to establish a new basis for tubing and fitting testing. An evaluation of hydraulic impulse surges by computer and test verification in Boeing aircraft was conducted. A revised impulse wave form is considered as a recommended standard for impulse testing of tubing and fittings. New criteria are recommended for both the instal- lation and the testing of hydraulic tubing systems. Advanced installation techniques are suggested as a means to circumvent most of the service failures once the tube connectors have passed the advanced testing meth- ods. 1970 SA E Transactions 700790. High-Temperature Polyimide Hydraulic Actuator Rod Seals for Advanced Aircraft. William R. Loomis and Robert L. Johnson, Lewis Research Center, NASA.; and John Lee, Royal Industries. This paper summarizes the results and findings of a program to design, develop, and evaluate actuator rod seals for use in advanced aircraft high-temperature hydraulic systems. The rod seals are intended to function efficiently and reliably for 3000 hr in the temperature range of -40-500 F. Preliminary studies of various material and design combinations showed that a polyimide low- pressure second-stage V-seal in a two-stage configuration had the greatest potential in long-term duty cycle testing in a simulated actuator test system. Modifications of this seal that provided for improved fatigue life and more efficient loading met the test objectives of 20 x 106 short-stroke cycles of operation at 500 F. Severity of this testing was equivalent to 3000 hr of duty cycle operation. The validity of design techniques used to achieve per- formance goals was shown. 700791. Compatibility, Friction and Leakage of Pneu- matic Actuator Rod and Piston Head Seals up to 750 F and 1000 psi. Paul R. Shepler and Carl H. Onken, Koppers Co., Inc. Laboratory tests on rod seals, piston head seals, and rider rings, in air at temperatures up to 750 F and pressures of 1000 psig at 4 and 15 cpm of a 2 in. stroke, show TFE (glass, carbon and bronze filled) rod and piston head seals are satisfactory with 17-4 PH rods, 347 SS cylinders, 4130 steel rods and cylinders; TFE (glass and carbon filled) to be satisfactory with chrome plated rods and cylinders; glass filled TFE to be satisfactory with anodized alu- minum cylinders. Special polymer (polyimide) was sat- isfactory with 17-4 PH rods, but was unsatisfactory with chrome plated rods and cylinders, anodized aluminum cylinders, 347 SS cylinders, and 4130 steel rods and cylinders. Low alloy pearlitic grey iron (K6E) was unsatisfactory with chrome plated rods and cylinders and 4130 steel rods and cylinders. S-Monel was incompatible with all bare and coated rods and cylinders tested. 700792. A New Development in High-Speed Variable Delivery Vane Pumps. W. H. Gibson and L. Fox, Hydro-Aire Div., Crane Co. Hydro-Aire, assisted by Battelle Memorial Institute, has instituted the use of a flexible laminated cam ring for a high-speed variable displacement vane pump. This devel- opment work is an extension of previous development work done by Battelle for the Air Force Aero Propulsion 185</page><page sequence="111">700793-700800 186 Laboratory, the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Center, and the U.S. Army Aviation Materiel Laboratories. The paper provides a brief history of flexible cam ring pump development, a description of a recent pump design, typical performance characteristics and advantages, and a list of potential applications. It can be concluded the pump is ready to be applied to a host of high-speed variable displacement applications and that it has the primary advantages of simplicity, light weight, and high speed. 700793. Hydrofluidic Flight Controls. W. M. Posingies, Honeywell Inc. This paper describes the application of hydrofluidics to stability augmentation systems. Criteria for selecting fluidics for a specific application is presented. A typical hydrofluidic system is presented to show principles of operation, transfer functions and component perform- ance. A brief description of the power supply system shows how this system is integrated into existing aircraft without extensive modifications to the hydraulic power supply. Major problem areas of noise, leakage and contamination are discussed. 700794. Development of a Hybrid Fluidic Damper Control for an Aircraft Yaw Axis. D. R. Cooper, G. R. Wells and S. R. Bluhm, Bendix Aerospace- Electronics Co. This paper describes the concept and development of an all fluid (hydraulic) system for yaw axis stability aug- mentation of a commercial jet aircraft. This unique system uses a fluidic accelerometer as a sensor, a bellows actuated flapper nozzle circuit for signal amplification, and a conventional spool type power stage driving an actuator with mechanical position feedback. The system replaces a rate sensor and differentiation network and most of the signal amplification stages found in more conventional fluidic stability augmentation systems. A complete analog simulation, along with prototype testing, was performed to insure the required performance of the final design. Also included in the paper is a summary of system performance testing. 700796. Low-Cost Fabrication Techniques for Solid Rock- et Nozzles. J. J. Warga, Aerojet Solid Propulsion Co. Savings of 50% can be achieved in ablative nozzles for 260 in. diameter solid rocket motors using present state- of-the-art materials. An optimum nozzle design with respect to cost and performance results from the use of a standard carbon-phenolic tape grade for the throat insert and canvas, carbon-silica, and silica materials throughout the remainder of the nozzle. 700798. High Chamber Pressure Reusable Rocket Engine Technology. Carl L. C. Kah, Florida Res. &amp; Dev. Center, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft. Performance and extended component life are key requirements of propulsion for reusable launch craft (the space shuttle). Performance of the engine and vehicle require engines with high expansion ratio nozzles in compact sizes. The combination of thrust, specific im- pulse, and engine envelope required for the space shuttle can be achieved with a 3000-psia chamber pressure rocket engine. Pumping the propellants to high pressures requires high turbopump horsepower, dictating a staged combus- tion rocket engine cycle to eliminate the thrust per- formance loss associated with propellants that are used to drive the turbopumps. High energy density engines have much higher heat fluxes, turbomachinery speeds and mechanical stress than prior generations of rocket engines requiring more sophisticated design methods and me- chanical configuration to meet the performance objec- tives. The reuse requirements place new restrictions on the design of rocket engines, particularly in the hot section areas where low cycle fatigue (LCF) and material creep properties determine life and cyclic limits. Design pro- cedures and criteria that are being used for the design of Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft's reusable shuttle rocket engine are based on those that have been used successfully for the design of commercial and military turbojet engines. This paper discusses significant components and features of design that give lightweight highly stressed parts extended component life. 1970 SA E Transactions 700800.

Air Force weapons systems require long-term mainte- nance-free storage, preferably under uncontrolled envi- ronmental conditions. Liquid propulsion system com- ponents must be capable of satisfactory operation after years of exposure to highly reactive propellants while retaining the propellant without leakage under severe ambient conditions of temperature and relative humidity. Oxidizer leakage caused by improper component design and severe ambient storage conditions has presented serious operational problems. The Air Force Rocket Propulsion Laboratory (AFRPL) has initiated a program to investigate the storability of liquid system components and tankage under extreme conditions of relative humidity and temperature. A variety of system components and tankage materials are being evaluated for long-term storability with storable liquid rocket fuels and oxidizers. Storage conditions are 85 F temperature and 85% RH for oxidizer systems and +65 to + 165 F temperature for fuel systems. The propellants under test are N204, C1F5, N2H4, and MHF-5. Tankage materials under test are various alloys of aluminum, steel, and titanium. The results of almost 3 years of testing on a representative number of tankage materials have indicated that leakage of propellant can occur as a result of improper weld joint design, inadequate quality control in</page><page sequence="112">700801-700805 fabrication and inadequate acceptance leakage testing. Factors which can contribute to the development of oxidizer leakage are a high ambient relative humidity (30%) and stress-corrosion cracking susceptibility of the tank material in combination with the propellant and trace quantities of foreign compounds/elements in the propellant. 700801. Nuclear Rocket Design Approach. Ira L. Helms and James J. Lombardo, National Aeronautic &amp; Space Administration. The current status of the NERVA Nuclear Rocket Engine Design Methodology is presented together with specific examples of the application of modern probabilistic design techniques which lead to having high reliability in the initial design.

Vaughan and Darrell Kendrick, Manned Spacecraft Center, NASA. The reaction-control-system requirements for the space shuttle include long life, high reliability, reusability, minimal easy system maintenance, and refurbishment in addition to the usual requirements of reasonable system performance, minimum system weight, and flexibility to operate over a wide range of environmental and oper- ational conditions. The use of gaseous-oxygen/hydrogen propellants potentially provides this capability. Identi- fiable space-shuttle reaction-control-system requirements are presented, and the two most promising system concepts described and compared. These concepts are the low-chamber-pressure concept, in which the main injec- tion ranks are used as accumulators and heat exchangers to provide the reaction-control engines with the gaseous propellants; and the high-chamber-pressure concept, in which a gas generator/turbopump/heat exchangers is used to provide the propellants to the engines. The overall performances of the two systems are compared and results of sensitivity studies presented. Results of the Manned Spacecraft Center in-house oxygen/hydrogen reaction- control-system-engine technology program are examined, including performance evaluation (combustion efficiency, heating rates, etc.) of three basic injector concepts. Significant factors that influence the engine design relative to application to the space shuttle are discussed. 700803. Design and Fabrication of Small H2/02 Engines. S. J. Domokos and G. L. Falkenstein, Rocke tdyne/North American Rockwell. Auxiliary propulsion systems (APS), which provided for attitude control during orbit maneuvering and reentry of previous manned spacecraft (such as Gemini and Apollo), used earth-storable liquid propellants and were designed to be used for a single mission. APS for next generation spacecraft such as the Space Shuttle and Tug will utilize cryogenic propellants (hydrogen and oxygen) and will be designed for reuse over a 10-year operational life. This new philosophy imposes requirements for systems and component designs not available from the propulsion systems used on the Apollo and Gemini programs. The challenging assignment for propulsion engineers is to utilize existing cryogenic technology, derived from pre- vious research and large engine programs and augmented by current technology programs, to arrive at design solutions that will satisfy mission requirements of the next generation of space vehicles. This paper describes some of the candidate hydro- gen/oxygen auxiliary propulsion systems, identifies crit- ical technologies, and discusses the design and fabrication of thrust chamber assemblies to meet typical mission requirements. 700804. Powerplant Design for Noise Suppression. C. L. Bagby, Douglas Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. The design configuration of turbofan powerplant instal- lations for commercial aircraft is significantly influenced by the requirement for reduced aircraft noise. This paper describes the design evolution of the installation of the CF6, the high-bypass ratio engine in the McDonnell Douglas DC- 10, as it was influenced by the need for noise suppression measures. The candidate alternatives and the basic trade-off criteria leading to the selected configu- ration are presented. This paper also includes some considerations asso- ciated with choice of material, construction, and design techniques applicable to various areas of sound treatment within the nacelle. 700805. Minimum Noise Pod Design. J. R. Thompson, Lockheed-California Co.; and M. J. T. Smith, Rolls-Royce, Ltd. The necessity for realizing a major reduction in com- munity noise from that produced by the current air transport fleet was recognized at the inception of the design of the Lockheed L-1011 Trijet wide-bodied trans- port. This paper summarizes the technical considerations and design procedures used to ensure attainment of the low noise objective. It is shown that the Rolls-Royce RB.211 engine selected for the L-1011 incorporates the latest state- of-the-art noise reduction features, including the novel shaft-slowing provision. These features result in a signif- icant reduction in basic noise level compared to low bypass ratio engines currently in service, even at the considerably increased size required for the L-1011. The additional noise reduction required to satisfy the low community noise objective and the FAR Part 36 limits is attained by incorporation of advanced noise suppression materials into an efficient propulsion pod design. The technology, design restraints, and system requirements which must be combined into the practical optimum minimum noise pod design are described. 187</page><page sequence="113">700806-700811 188 700806. Impact of Noise on Subsonic Transport Design. Harry Dreli, Lockheed-California Co. The impact of noise regulations on the design and configuration development aspects of subsonic jet trans- ports is examined for an aircraft which carries a pre- scribed payload a given range and operates within a given fixed field length. The normal design process used to select wing loading, thrust loading, and aspect ratio is first reviewed without consideration for noise, and then examined considering noise. The sensitivity of these parameters for noise reduction is developed and com- pared to the noise reductions available through design of the engine and acoustic treatment of the powerplants. Finally, the overall trade-off in takeoff gross weight or payload per PNdb reduction for each of the design parameters is evaluated. 1970 SA E Transactions 700807. Noise Considerations in the Design of Advanced Subsonic Transport Turbofan Engines. R. £. Neitzel and M. J. Benzakein, General Electric Co. The problems and choices in the design of an advanced subsonic transport turbofan ' for reduced noise and improved aircraft performance are examined in this paper. The effects of bypass ratio, fan pressure ratio, and fan tip speed on jet noise, fan noise, and acoustic treatment suppression are described. The results do not indicate a clear optimum bypass ratio considering the effects upon installed engine performance and weight as well as acoustic performance. Low fan tip speed designs with the associated high aerodynamic loading are compared to high tip speed low loading designs. Other factors affecting noise such as the installation and other noise sources are discussed. The long duct installation is indicated to have potential advantages over the short duct separate flow installation. The problem of assuring that growth models of an engine also have low noise is discussed. 1970 SA E Transactions 700808. The Design of the U.S. SST for Low Community Noise. J. D. Vachal and B. H. Florsheim, The Boeing Co. The need for achievement of low community noise levels has had a major influence on the configuration selected for the United States Supersonic Transport (Boeing 2707-300). The selection and development of design features which affect community noise are presented. The configuration has a relatively large span delta wing of moderate sweep and wing loading, with full span leading and trailing edge flaps. An all moving horizontal tail with geared flap is used for trim and control. The use of an unusually far aft center of gravity range is achieved through a fulltime stability augmentation system. All of these design features contribute to low drag at high lift, resulting in high takeoff performance and low levels of thrust required during flight over the community during both takeoff and landing. The resulting airplane has the versatility to use operational techniques which further reduce noise. Noise characteristics of various power plant types are not treated, but the effect on noise of engine- airframe matching is discussed. 700809. Planning the Evolution of V/STOL Powerplants. A. G. Newton and S. C. Miller, Rolls-Royce Ltd. It seems likely that a STOL system with 100 to 150- passenger aircraft will be established in the second half of the 1970's, and that, from it, a VTOL system will evolve in the 1980's. Prior demonstration of the feasibility of all aspects of these systems is vital if the final commitment is to be made without high risk. Achievement of the necessary levels of confidence in the engines for these aircraft will result only from a carefully planned program. The paper reviews the various alternative powerplant proposals for the first large STOL aircraft and describes the current and future programs of work which form this planned evolutionary process. 700810. An Initial Look at Management and Design Considerations for Commercial STOL Propulsion Systems. G. P. Sallee, American Airlines, Inc. A STOL aircraft requires a level of design and per- formance integration beyond that currently involved in commercial transport aircraft. Each vehicle concept uses the propulsion system to provide a substantial portion of the low speed aerodynamic lift. This fact makes engine dynamic performance have a strong influence on the handling qualities and performance of the aircraft, as does the aerodynamics on the proper engine cycle for the best mission performance. The airlines equally have require- ments which place demands on the technical ingenuity of the designer. These requirements may be overlooked in initial design studies. To preclude this oversight, the airlines' powerplant requirements are discussed from an airline point of view with major emphasis placed on propulsion subsystem design responsibility, engine selec- tion, thrust deterioration, and maintainability. 700811. Synthesis of Future High-Lift Systems. Richard Scherrer, Lockheed-California Co. The subject of high-lift systems is extremely broad and must therefore be restricted in order to be tractable. In this paper, it is felt to be sufficient to consider 4-engine M = 0.8 turbofan aircraft with about 1800 ft FAA field length capability. Even with the foregoing limitations on scope, it is only possible to present what are felt to be the essential concepts at the edge of the propulsion, aero- dynamic, and design elements of the subject. The analysis indicates that when there is a need for turbofan STOL aircraft capable of operation from 1800-ft fields, this need can be satisfied by aircraft that are similar in size and proportions to current conventional aircraft. Propulsion developments in process are expected to yield engines with excellent thrust matching between low-speed and high-speed requirements. The weights and noise of these engines are expected to be completely acceptable.</page><page sequence="114">700812-700819 Efficient cascade-type thrust deflectors suitable for the resulting high-bypass engines also appear possible. In order to use conventional wing loadings and aspect ratios, maximum lift coefficients must approach the theoretical limit of circulation lift. Projected developments in variable geometry, blowing BLC leading edge slats combined with blowing BLC trailing edge flaps, are expected to provide the needed improvements. The propulsion and aerodynamic trends that could result in a family of 24 possible high-lift systems appear to contain only three acceptable members. The one ac- ceptable first-generation concept provides a basis for evolution to the two possible second-generation systems, possibly with a common airframe. 1970 SA E Transactions 700812. The Evolutionary Development and Current Status of the Augmentor Wing Concept. J. E. Middlebrooks and H. C. Tinney, The Boeing Co.; and D. C. Whittley, de Havilland Aircraft of Canada. A review is made of the previously reported status of the augmentor wing concept, including test work of de Havilland Aircraft of Canada and the NASA Ames Research Center. More recent NASA data which formed the basis for proceeding with a flight research vehicle program on the Buffalo CV-7A are discussed. This background is used to show potential application to a turbofan-powered production airplane concept whose highly integrated propulsion and aerodynamics show promise for a very quiet STOL. Proposed future aug- mentor wing development programs are also briefly discussed. 700814. The Hamilton Standard APU for Lockheed's TriStar Airliner. Paul G. Stein, Hamilton Stand- ard Div., United Aircraft. Aircraft have been equipped with Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) to provide compressed air and shaft power. The Hamilton Standard APU for the Lockheed TriStar airplane represents a new and different design concept that will result in major improvements in operating economy and reliability to the airline operators. Design and development stages of the APU are presented in this paper. The free-turbine engine design offers excellent full- or part-time economy and efficiency while operating at high engine-cycle pressure ratios. This APU also offers the concept of automatic paralleling of electrical equipment. 700815. TSCP700 Auxiliary Power Unit for the DC-10 Aircraft. Donald A. Malohn, AiResearch Man- ufacturing Co. of Arizona. The Model TSCP700 discussed in this paper is a new advanced-technology auxiliary power unit currently under development at AiResearch. The design provides the most favorable fuel consumption characteristics possible with the current state-of-the-art and the excellent maintain- ability characteristics required for airline auxiliary power unit operation. This optimization is accomplished by a twinspool, coaxial, high-pressure-ratio cycle with inter- stage bleed from the low-pressure spool and shaft power extraction from the constant-speed high-pressure spool. Variable turbine nozzles, at the first-stage of the low- pressure spool, control pneumatic output to satisfy the environmental control system requirements (on a demand basis) and, thus, minimize the fuel consumption. 700816. APU Selection - An Airline Viewpoint. L. H. Allen and W. P. Frey, Pan American World Airways, Inc. An APU installation is considered essential for all transport aircraft, due to many attractive benefits, including high-capacity airconditioning during all ground operation, plus increased flexibility for terminal and maintenance activities. For an effective installation, high goals of reliability and utility must be established in the selection and design process. 700817. Concorde Thrust Management. C. E. G. Payne and A. M. Lewis, Rolls-Royce Limited. The Rolls-Royce/S.N.E.C.M.A. Olympus 593 employs a variable area primary nozzle and has a reheat system - both novelties to civil aviation. The main purpose of this paper is to show that these innovations are accommodated without generating crew work load problems. Conse- quently the paper is aimed primarily at the airline user rather than the control system speciahst. A brief descrip- tion is given of the basic engine electrical control and its interface with the intake system. The flight deck mounted thrust management controls and indicators are identified and their use described during the course of a typical flight. The subject of engine mechanical condition monitoring is also examined. 700818. Propulsion Control Integration for Power Man- agement. T. A. Flanders and W. Britnell, Ham- ilton Standard Div., United Aircraft Corp. Integration of propulsion controls can simplify the task of aircraft power management. Not only can integration ease the pilot's problem of adjusting engine power settings according to the flight mode, but it also enables improved propulsion system performance to be achieved and extends the regions of safe and stable operation. Such improvements to the inlet/engine compatibility by them- selves warrant the use of control system integration, but once the controls are adapted for ease of data exchange they can easily accommodate power management func- tions and the processing of parameters for a maintenance monitor. One possible method of implementation is described utilizing state-of-the-art hardware. 700819. Electric Thrust Control System for Supersonic Transport Powerplant. Richard F. Gorman and Donald L. Morrow, The Boeing Co. The design of the propulsion control system for the supersonic transport (SST) is a culmination of three years 189</page><page sequence="115">700820-700826 190 of design trade studies. An analysis was made of the throttle systems of the Boeing 747, XB-70, Concorde, and other airplanes, with a view toward the applicability of these systems for use on the SST. The major consid- erations that led to selection of a redundant channel electrohydraulic propulsion control system were: safety, operational-reliability, performance, and weight. Pre- sented here is a description of the SST propulsion control system which is composed of two subsystems, the thrust control subsystem and the mode control subsystem. 700820. Programmed Engine Maintenance - C5A Mal- function Detection Analysis &amp; Recording System (MADARS). E. W. Home and L. R. Price, U.S. Air Force.; and M. S. Edwards, Lockheed- Georgia Co. The C-5 Malfunction Detection Analysis and Recording (MAD AR) subsystem performs these on-board functions for selected subsystems, including the TF39-GE-1 engine. Studies were made by General Electric, the engine manufacturer, to define the extent of detection, analysis, and recording necessary for the TF39. These studies, together with the selected maintenance philosophy, defined a number of line replaceable units (LRU's) associated with the engine. The selected LRU's then determined the parameters to be monitored for the engines. Further studies defined the instrumentation requirements for obtaining the parameters. The computer programs for on-board fault isolation and incipient malfunction detection have been partially defined. Fur- ther analysis to establish limits and correlation procedures is to be completed. In addition, recorded information is analyzed in a central data bank (CDB) in a ground processing system (GPS), where refined prediction programs are being developed. The ground processing system, together with the MADAR system form a complete maintenance information system for the C-5. Future expansion of the MADAR/GPS concept would allow individual C-5's to be monitored instantaneously from a maintenance information central with all the advantages such a concept implies. 700821. Direct Drive Accessories, Feasible by 1980? Edward F. Esmeier and James R. Tracy, Florida Res. &amp; Dev. Center, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Div. Direct drive turbine engine control components and airframe accessories are expected to be feasible by 1980. A comparison between a currently operational engine and a projected 1980 engine indicates a weight reduction of 1 1% and a frontal area reduction of 30% can be achieved by the use of direct drive components and accessories. Instead of gearbox, the projected engine uses a combi- nation of engine-rotor-driven components (fuel pump, oil pumps, and starter) and hot-gas-turbine-driven accesso- ries (electric generator and hydraulic pump). The technological advancements that must be ac- complished during this decade to realize the projected engine improvements are discussed. 700822. Are Microelectronic Circuits Reliable Enough for Aircraft Engine Control Applications? R. S. Smith, Texas Instruments. The microcircuit industry is making significant advances in the area of high reliability. These advances are a result of development and testing related to the extreme reliability requirements of NASA space applications. Reliability testing programs have been expanded by many vendors. They are now proving that microcircuits can be tested and selected for severe temperature and vibration environments. The paper discusses the general jet engine environ- mental requirements and the applicable microcircuit tests and data. 700823. Control System Requirements and Considera- tions for High Temperature Engines. R. D. McLain, Allison Div., General Motors Corp. As a result of technological advances in materials and cooling techniques, the stoichiometric or maximum temperature engine is now on the horizon. The high turbine inlet temperature makes possible improvements in engine performance and reductions in size and weight. Simultaneously, it poses new considerations in the selection of an engine control system. Not only are temperature levels higher and flow ranges wider, but perhaps most significant is the stoichiometric fuel air ratio. The impact of potential fuel rich combustor mixtures must be thoroughly considered in selecting a control mode. This paper deals with some of these considerations and the resulting requirements which will influence the selection and design of a high temperature engine control system. Its purpose is not to provide specific answers, but rather to suggest areas in which additional study should be conducted. 700825. Jet Engine Control Systems - Their Evolution, Future Requirements and Potential Limitations. Philip G. Dooley, United Aircraft Corp. The evolution of Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft turbojet and turbofan engine control systems is reviewed to provide an understanding of their ability to handle the increasing number of variables being incorporated in modern engines as well as their potential limitations in this respect. Future engine designs are expected to require more precise control of even more engine operating variables such as inlet guide vane angle, and jet, turbine vane and duct nozzle areas. To provide pilots with the degree of automation consistent with today's technology, the use of an overall power management system separate from the engine control is foreseen. 700826. Engine Control Concepts for the Augmented Turbofan. M. W. French, General Electric Co.</page><page sequence="116">700827-700831 The augmented turbofan engine, currently being de- veloped for several advanced military applications, presents new challenges to the control designer. A fresh approach to the engine control design is necessary to exploit the promising characteristics of this propulsion system in the far-ranging areas of the flight spectrum. The General Electric Company has been developing an integrated electrical/hydromechanical control system design expressly for this new breed of propulsion system. This paper discusses the requirements for the system, the results of control mode studies, and the highlights of the resulting control design. Special features of the control, including new sensing requirements, are discussed. 700827. Propulsion System Control Requirements, Ca- pabilities and Opportunities. Charles E. Bentz, Air Force Aero Propulsion Lab. Propulsion system controls have been steadily increasing in complexity to meet the regulation and limiting requirements of current and future turbine engines. With the need to provide improved transient and steady state engine performance during all phases of flight operations, the control functions of the inlet, engine and exhaust nozzle must be integrated to insure engine-airframe compatibility and stability. This requirement further increases the sensing, computational and regulation functions of the propulsion system control. In the past, electronic controls have played a subordinate role because of the severe turbine engine flight environment and the computation needs of the engine could usually be met by hydro-mechanical components. With future trends for increased complexity and system integration, the compu- tational capabilities of electronic controls will find increased utilization to optimize thrust and fuel con- sumption and to maintain inlet-engine compatibility .This paper describes the environmental and functional re- quirements of engine mounted control components and discusses the opportunities new control technologies have for consideration during the evolution of an advanced engine. With this insight, more timely planning and execution of state-of-the-art advances in propulsion system control technology can be accomplished to meet the functionability, performance, and confidence goals of future propulsion system hardware. 700828. 747 Flight Test Certification. Donald D. Archer, The Boeing Co. The 747 flight test certification program was initiated with the first flight of the No. 1 airplane on February 9, 1969. Five test airplanes were used in an intensive test program involving 1443 flight hr and 36-1/4 airplane months, with the last certification flight on December 23, 1969. Full type certification approval was granted by the FAA on December 30, 1969 after a total of 10-2/3 months of flight testing. These statistics compare very well with the original program estimates, which were based on Boeing's extensive experience with development and certification testing of commercial transport airplanes. The success of this test program was not due to any great advancements in flight test techniques specifically for the 747, but was due to the tried and proven test methods developed during past certification programs at Boeing. This is not meant to imply that some new methods were not used, but to emphasize that test techniques evolve with experience. This paper will discuss both the test methods and the data systems used during the test program. 700829. New Laboratory Requirements for the DC-10. D. B. Engum, Douglas Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. Existing laboratory facilities were inadequate to accom- plish the test requirements of the wide-bodied transports. Expansion was required by the size of the structure and the advanced technology of the flight guidance and control systems. The Douglas Aircraft Co.'s test labo- ratories have been relocated to a new engineering development center, providing a large, high-bay test hangar and ready access to an extensive digital and analog computer facility for data reduction and simulation. Additionally, Douglas had designed and built four large test machines with a fatigue loading capability of 1-1/2 million lb and is applying advanced servo loading techniques to both the airplane structural proof test and fatigue test programs. 700830. DC-10 Test Program Effectiveness. Arthur Torosian and James F. Murray, Douglas Air- craft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. The DC-10 aircraft test program has been planned to provide increased overall efficiency and effectiveness. A series of comprehensive engineering development simu- lations and aircraft ground tests will precede the flight test program, which will employ a sophisticated data acqui- sition and processing system with the capability to provide real-time data while the tests are in progress. A flight controls development test stand will be used to evaluate the prototype flight control and avionic equipment, and to provide the capability for pilot assessment of the flight guidance and control (FGC) system by means of an integrated simulator complex. A laser beam tracking system will be used to provide the space positioning data required in FGC, noise measurement, and takeoff and landing performance tests. Training on the DC-10, which began one year prior to the scheduled first flight, will be broadened to include test runs and flight simulation to establish plans and to train all test-related personnel. 700831. Aerospace Pyrotechnics. V. W. Drexelius, McDonnell Aircraft Co. Pyrotechnic applications in the aerospace industry have multiplied in scope and function since introduction in personnel escape systems in 1947. An overview of significant advances in design, application and testing, is presented. Emphasis is placed on the engineering ap- proach rather than the "black magic" aspect so frequently found in early developments. A pressure-controlled 191</page><page sequence="117">700832-700843 192 propellant-actuated device is discussed along with new test techniques for performance evaluation. A look into the crystal ball concerning the future aspects of pyro- technics is also presented. 1970 SAE Transactions 700832. Helicopter Personnel Escape and Survival Sys- tem. Ryland D. Wiseman, Jr., U.S. Naval Weapons Lab. The feasibility of a personnel escape capsule system for helicopters is shown. This feasibility was demonstrated by incorporating an escape system into an UH-25B heli- copter and conducting tie-down, drop, and drone tests. The present status of designing this type of system into an operational helicopter such as the CH-46 and UH-1 helicopter is outlined. 1970 SAE Transactions 700833. Apollo Spacecraft Pyrotechnics. William H. Simmons, NASA Manned Spacecraft Center. The functions performed by pyrotechnic systems and devices in the Apollo spacecraft during a lunar ex- ploration mission and in aborts are presented. The devices and systems are described. The modular cartridge concept and the standard electroexplosive device used throughout the spacecraft are innovations and are discussed in detail. Some of the techniques used to attain the high levels of reliability, to assure crew safety, to control quality, and to eliminate human errors are briefly presented. 1970 SAE Transactions 700835. Operational Concept for the Employment of Harrier. John R. Braddon, U.S. Marine Corps. The Harrier will meet a longstanding Marine Corps requirement for a fast-reaction close support which can be based in close proximity to maneuver units, can respond quickly to requests for close air support, can displace quickly from ship to shore and from one land base to another, and can provide fixed wing support from amphibious shipping. In order to insure that Harrier satisfies these requirements, the Marine Corps is devel- oping a concept for operational employment of Harrier within the Fleet Marine Force. The concept will address basing at sea and on land, logistic support, and command and control. 700837. Designing the OV-10A Forward Air Control and Light Attack Aircraft. Jack E. Wagner and Richard J. Arnold, North American Rockwell Corp. The design of the OV-10A accepted the challenge of interpreting basic concepts founded on counterinsurgency experience and developing a weapon system, which would provide effective air support for COIN and other low intensity operations. Maximum reliability and surviva- bility were required in a low cost machine that must be easy to operate and maintain. The North American Rockwell OV-10A Bronco exemplifies the results of the purposeful program to integrate the experience and knowledge from many disciplines toward a common goal. The degree to which this effort was effective is shown by its highly successful performance in Southeast Asia. 700840. Navy Application of the ACV to Amphibious Operations. Melvin W. Brown, NSRDC, U.S. Navy. The U.S. Navy has initiated a program which will define the sizes and configurations of air cushion craft for application to amphibious operations in an effort to provide more cost-effective movement of equipment and material from ship to shore and to provide greater flexibility in operations. The program approach and some of the problems anticipated in applying the ACV to this role are discussed. 700841. Independently Rotating Wheels for High Speed Trains. A. Kaplan, T. K. Hasselman and S. A. Short, TRW Systems Group. The results of an analysis of the dynamics of individually rotating wheel systems for use on high speed rail vehicles are presented in this paper. The objective of the system is to remove the hunting stability problems of conventional rail-wheel systems and thus improve the vehicle ride comfort and safety. The analysis indicates that the use of independently rotating wheel systems eliminates the standard hunting instability, but it introduces a lightly damped but stable oscillation of its own. However, by increasing the yaw stiffness between the wheels and the vehicle body the frequency of this oscillation can be moved beyond the low point in the human vibration tolerance unit. When this is done the ride response is improved over that for an integral wheel system. 1970 SAE Transactions 700842. The Treatment of Randomness in Finite Element Modeling. Gary C. Hart, University of Cali- fornia, Los Angeles.; and Jon D. Collins, Analytical Sciences Corp. A linear statistical model is developed for analyzing the statistics of response of static and dynamic finite element models. The model uses the statistical moments of random physical properties (for example, modulus of elasticity) to establish the degree of uncertainty in computed static deflections, frequencies, and buckling loads. A sample problem is included showing the influence of property variance and covariance upon all three areas of interest. 1970 SAE Transactions 700843. Application of Aerospace Data Analysis Tech- niques to Automotive Crash Safety Problems. Ronald D. Kelly, Measurement Systems Corp. A number of data analysis techniques have been de- veloped in the aerospace field to assist in the solution of shock and vibration problems. The potential value of several of these techniques to aid in the solution of crash safety problems is discussed. Each technique is illustrated</page><page sequence="118">700844-700856 by application to acceleration measurements from pas- senger vehicle crash tests. 700844. Dynamic Analysis of Automotive Structural Sys- tems. Lawrence Selna and David Salinas, Uni- versity of California, Los Angeles. A mathematical model is developed for the study of vehicle dynamic behavior of crash environments. Once developed such a model will allow the simulation of many vehicle structure-crash combinations at low cost. Ulti- mately the model is to be used as a design tool for determining structural configurations which optimize passenger safety. The initial phase of the work is described, and a simulation of a frontal vehicle crash is presented using the model at its present level of devel- opment. 1970 SA E Transactions 700846. Response of Electronic Cabinets Excited by a Fast Sine Sweep. S. A. Short and J. C. McMunn, TRW Systems Group. This paper presents the dynamic response of an electronic cabinet subjected to an amplitude-modulated fast sine sweep. The fast sine sweep is synthesized to have a prescribed response spectra. The cabinet is modeled as a multidegree-of-freedom system in each of three orthogonal directions and the dynamic response is computed using mode superposition. The analytical results are compared to experimental results and the agreement is shown to be good. 700847. Discrete Element Idealization of Fluids for Vi- bration Analysis. D. A. Hunt, McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co. A new type of structural element for discrete element idealization of fluids is investigated. With this structural element and the standard structural elements, a missile and liquid propellant can be idealized as one composite structure consisting of many elements. A theory for taking slosh into account is derived by establishing a slosh stiffness matrix for the fluid elements. This development enables all linear displacement modes of a missile and liquid propellant to be computed. Some of the modes are zero frequency modes, reflecting a true liquid charac- teristic. 700848. Utilization of Resonant Fixtures to Attain High Amplitudes in Shock Synthesis Testing. C. David Robbins, Dallas Baptist College.; and Paul E. Vaughan, LTV Electrosystems. In recent years, advances have been made in the application of electrodynamic vibration exciters for performing shock tests specified in terms of the response spectrum. Instrumentation has been designed and is available to synthesize and control a shock excitation that has the desired shock spectrum. Some test specifications, especially those pertaining to pyrotechnic environments, require very high shock spectrum amplitudes-some as high as 10,000 g. These high levels exceed the capability of most vibration exciters, particularly for large test loads. Resonant fixtures have been utilized to attain high level vibration amplitudes. However, the desired results can be achieved only over a very narrow frequency band. To a much greater extent, resonant fixtures can be used to attain high shock response amplitudes over the entire frequency range of interest in shock synthesis testing with vibration exciters. 700850. Honeycomb Fastening. C. H. Walker, Fort Worth Div., General Dynamics Corp. Attachment of honeycomb sandwich structure has been an important design consideration in the aerospace field since the early 50's when bonded sandwich was first used extensively as covering for the wings and tail of the supersonic B-58. Since then, virtually all military and an increasing number of commercial aircraft and space vehicles utilize honeycomb sandwich as primary structure. This paper illustrates the basic approaches to sandwich panel attachment and the variety of typical solutions. Successful honeycomb fastening design concepts from B-58, B-57F, and F-lll production programs at General Dynamics are illustrated. Sealing of sandwich joints for use as integral fuel tanks and application of specialty fasteners for honeycomb sandwich are discussed. Struc- tural efficiency of "fastened" stepped-down edge concepts versus full-depth panel edges is compared. A full-depth panel edge design with a stud and plug with spliceplate is currently an attractive design for fastening both metallic and composite-faced sandwich. 700851. Effect of Basic Thread Parameters on Fatigue Life. R. A. Walker and R. J. Finkelston, Standard Pressed Steel Co. The effect of basic thread parameters on the fatigue performance of high fatigue strength fasteners is dis- cussed. Fatigue data were obtained in a carefully con- trolled experiment and statistically analyzed to present a comparison between ISO metric threads and nonsym- metric threads. The bolts tested were made to ISO aircraft standards for high strength fasteners of steel and titanium. Available fastener design theory is correlated with the fatigue strength improvements obtained from changes in thread parameters such as root radius, flank angle, and controlled lead compensation. 1970 SA E Transactions 700856. Advanced Titanium Alloys. John B. Guernsey, Colt Industries, Inc. Properties and applications of three recently introduced heat-treatable beta titanium alloys (Beta III, 8Mo- 8V-2Fe-3Al, and 38644) are discussed. This class of alloys offers properties significantly different from those of the common alpha-beta grades. The beta alloys are cold workable, simploy heat treatable to high strengths even in heavy sections, and very tough. Actual and potential 193</page><page sequence="119">700859-700872 194 applications include fasteners, sheet metal parts, tubing, and heavy section parts. Three new deep-hardenable alpha-beta grades (6A1- 2Sn-4Zr-6Mo, 6Al-6V-4Zr-4Mo, and IMI 680) are dis- cussed in less detail. These alloys are less hardenable and lower in fracture toughness than the beta grades, but have higher heat treated tensile ductility. 1970 SAE Transactions 700859. Sandwich Structure - An Evolving Concept. F. J. Riel, Rohr Corp. Sandwich construction has been used for many years in aircraft and missiles, because of its ability to provide strong, stiff, lightweight structures. While the technology is well-developed for certain combinations of materials, there are many new developments which will have a significant impact on future applications. These new developments can be grouped into the following cate- gories: joining methods, materials and geometries. This paper describes new technologies being de- veloped in each of these categories and the impact they will have on sandwich structures. 700862. New Materials in Aircraft Windshields. George L. Wiser, The Sierracin Corp. The Boeing 747 and Lockheed L- 1011 airliners, as well as several aircraft still on the drawing boards, have large, curved plastic windshields that would not have been possible as recently as five years ago. The paper discusses several recently developed transparent materials, which collectively were an important factor in making these new windshield concepts practical for both current and projected aircraft. Included are plastic materials, thin chemically strengthened glass, protective coatings, heat- resistant interlayers, and an electrically conductive coat- ing with improved light transmission and reduced re- flectance. The windshield designs of recent and projected aircraft are used to illustrate how windshield designers are making use of these new materials. 1970 SAE Transactions 700863. Advanced Bonding for Large Aircraft. J. Hong, Lockheed-California Co. The paper discusses the necessity for development of adhesive bonding of aircraft skin panels to provide benefits over purely riveted structures. These benefits are shown to be in the areas of design and producibility and manufacturing and process control. Tests to assure reliability of the fuselage and resistance to fatigue and corrosion are described. These tests utilize both conventional and recently developed techniques. Further development and testing techniques are suggested. 700869. IH Air Suspension. W. S. Locke, Inťl. Harvester Co. A new truck air suspension system has been developed which provides excellent roll stability and articulation capability without compromising the exceptionally soft ride characteristics of air suspension. The concurrent realization of roll stability and articulation capability for tandem driving axles has been achieved by designing a nearly rigid, roll resisting, rear axle, to be used in conjunction with a freely articulating, forward rear axle. This principle applies equally well for single driving axle vehicles, where the rigid axle provides the same roll stability while articulation, not really a problem on single axle vehicles, is provided by frame and front axle suspension flexibility. 1970 SAE Transactions 700870. A Shift Timer for Automatic Transmissions. J. L. Nolting and N. A. Nann, Texaco Inc.; and R. J. Goetchius, Celanese Fibers Co. The time required for the shifting elements in an automatic transmission to complete their engagements is an important indicator of the performance of both friction elements and automatic transmission fluids. The common method of measuring shifting time via analog (chart) recording techniques is somewhat time consuming; more- over, it is subject to interpretative error and does not lend itself to quick, accurate determinations. A shift timing device that has been designed and built utilizing digital techniques gives an automatic unattended digital readout of shift time. The details of this timer and applications of it to automatic transmission fluid testing are discussed. 700871. Designing Extreme Pressure and Limited Slip Gear Oils. H. V. Lowther and D. B. Smith, Mobil Research &amp; Development Corp. The development of extreme pressure and limited slip automotive gear oils requires care in the selection of base stocks and additives in order to achieve the desired balance of performance properties. Considerations in- volved in selection of extreme pressure agents, corrosion inhibitors, and friction modifiers are enumerated. Of particular interest is the interference of many corrosion inhibitors and friction modifiers with the desirable gear protection properties. Tests are described for use in evaluating the additives, and performance properties of fully formulated oils are shown. The need for a special lubricant for limited slip axles is described. 700872. Safe Highway Transportation of Bulk Liquids. L. A. Botkin, Fruehauf Corp. Bulk transportation of liquids is unique in that dynamic action of the liquid while the vehicle is in motion affects its roadability. Several parameters of the design influence the effect of this action, as documented by road tests and a theoretical analysis. Many liquids are hazardous, requiring attention to various types of accessory equip- ment to comply with various government regulations. The resulting highway tanker is a relatively complex welded structure of low alloy steel, aluminum or stainless steel.</page><page sequence="120">700874-700880 700874. Heavy-Duty, Long-Life, Dry Clutches. Martin J. Hermanns, Dana Corp. With respect to heavy-duty clutches, many design re- finements have been made providing improved life and operating characteristics. A large part of the paper is devoted to a technical analysis of two-plate clutches from the viewpoint of torque capacity and energy absorption. Vehicle test data indicate that the amount of energy converted to heat by the clutch during a normal vehicle start is extremely low. Vehicle start ability is the major factor influencing clutch facing life. Discussion: E. J. Radke, Borg-Warner Corp- 1970 SA E Transactions 700875. The Why, Status, and Future of Wet Clutches for Trucks. G. Robert Harting, Rockford Clutch Div., Borg-Warner Corp. The paper deals with the advantages offered by the wet clutch in truck operation. Although the technical basis for these advantages is presented, the paper is not highly technical and formulas and derivations have been omit- ted. The present status of wet clutch applications to trucks is presented, as its possible future in this industry. Discussion: E. J. Radke, Borg- Warner Corp. 1970 SAE Transactions 700876. Optimizing Vehicle Utilization Through Real Time Methods. Paul L. Millian, Paul's Trucking Corp. With traffic conditions worsening every day in the city and suburbs, with lower qualified labor due to the high demands for skilled people and therefore less training time, with the need for better security methods due to the tremendous rise in thefts, and last but not least, with more volume to be handled than ever in the history of this nation, the need for better controlling systems to optimize the utilization of vehicles used in the multistop operation of the freight delivery function is greater than ever before. A new and simple method is being developed to meet this demand. It consists of a Real Time Graph System, enabling the operation managers and dispatchers to compare the work progression to pre-established stand- ards, and to manage dynamically as the distribution process progresses during the working day. 700877. The U. S. Army Fuels Surveillance Research and Development Program. T. H. Jefferson, U. S. Army Mobility Equipment Research and De- velopment Center. The U. S. Army has an effective fuels surveillance research and development program covering the spectrum from a greater understanding of the phenomena asso- ciated with the decontamination of military hydrocarbon fuels to the delivery of end item hardware to the troops. The program consists of both in-house and contract research. The in-house research involves independent studies and laboratory investigations in the following categories: Surface chemistry studies, materials investi- gations, applied decontamination technology, advanced electromechanical studies, and microbiological contam- ination studies. The contract research is programmed to supplement and complement the in-house independent studies. This work is directed toward the advancement of fuels surveillance technology through advanced concepts and materials development. At present, the U. S. Army Mobility Equipment Research and Development Center is monitoring one active contract titled: "Investigation of Electrokinetics and High Energy Resonance Concepts for Decontaminating Military Hydrocarbon Fuels," with Atomics International, Canoga Park, California. To maintain a broad and continuing program and to assure the exploration of new ideas and concepts, several new research contract extensions and new contracts are proposed, including development of a bulk fuel-moni- toring system and physicochemical and electrokinetic approaches for the decontamination of hydrocarbon fuels. End items of hardware either recently delivered to the military or in development include: The Military Stand- ard Filter/Separator Family, the Fuel Monitoring System (Turbidimeter), the Multi-Product Pipeline Batch Inter- face Detector, and the Mobile Field Petroleum Labo- ratory. 700879. Heavy Distillate Gas Turbine Fuels - Handling Requirements for Land and Sea. M. F. Winkler, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. Heavy distillate fuels are well suited to gas turbine operation for industrial and marine service. The heavy distillate fuels significantly broaden the economic appli- cation potential of gas turbines. The fuel, the required fuel handling techniques, and the engine modifications re- quired for dependable operation and long life are discussed. Industrial gas turbine fuel specifications are designed to indicate suitable fuels for specific climates and anticipated duty cycles. Specific fuel properties causing reduced gas turbine life, increased smoke levels, or decreased reliability must be controlled. Many of the flight fuel requirements are not needed for the industrial gas turbines; however, there are other properties which must be specified. 700880. The Systems Approach to Heavy Truck Steering. Karl W. Schipper and K. G. Moss, Truck Operations, Ford Motor Co. The systems approach provides a technique that considers all facets of design and validation of a system as a series of dependent sub-systems. This technique involves treating the system in its entirety when establishing the per- formance parameters and requires that the criteria assigned to each component satisfy total performance. By designing in this objective manner, the system will be optimized and the over-all program will be conducted at maximum efficiency. 195</page><page sequence="121">700881-700888 196 This paper promulgates this process applied to the steering system of a heavy truck with the associated gains in vehicle performance.

Clark A. Searle, Eaton Yale &amp; Towne, Inc. This paper discusses the development of a new hydraulic pump for use in heavy duty truck power steering systems. It is hydraulically balanced in terms of shaft bearing loads and end plate deflection forces. It is capable of operation up to 2000 psi and 20 gpm output. It also includes a relief valve bypass to reservoir feature which makes it more tolerant of sustained relief valve operation. The design is easily adaptable to various mounting and reservoir configuration. In addition, the paper describes some of the tests which were used to evaluate the new design. Discussion: R. L.

Integral hydraulic power steering gears, similar in concept to those used on current passenger cars, are now being used on heavy and extraheavy trucks. This integral gear concept combines the steering gear, the control valve, and the hydraulic power cylinder into one durable and reliable assembly. This paper describes how such a gear was especially designed for this application, how the design was proven by qualification tests, and how product integrity is maintained. It is shown how this integral hydraulic power steering gear satisfies the needs of the heavy truck industry. Discussion: R. L. Atkin, TRW, Inc.; R. H. Sheppard, R. H. Sheppard Co., Inc.; W. B.

This paper characterizes and describes the vast training effort necessary to insure that the industry has the trained personnel for today's and future operations. Particular emphasis is placed upon the Ryder Me- chanic Certification Program as a new innovation for training today's service mechanic while reorganizing his current talent. Peripheral training programs related to certification are also discussed. Fleet managers will encounter some new approaches towards a solution of an industry wide problem-recruiting and retaining technical manpower. 700884. Correct Mixtures for Otto Engines. Paul H. Schweitzer, Optimizer Control Corp. The objective of this paper is to change a prevailing view on what is a correct mixture ratio for otto engines and to correct a malpractice that grew out of it. Differentiation between "best power" and "best economy" mixtures were found illusory. The wedge charts proved very useful for a clear understanding of the intricate relations. The origin of the misconceptions is traced in the history of the internal combustion engine. 700885. Fishhooks and Carburetor Calibration. Paul H. Schweitzer, Optimizer Control Corp. Customary and refined methods used for the calibration of carburetors and fuel injection systems are evaluated. A widely used method of calibration for best economy mixture was found defective. Experimental technique for correct calibration is described. Graphical analysis is presented to obtain correct results from improper data. 700886. Total Cooling of Piston Engines by Direct Water Injection. W. D. Weatherford, Jr. and R. D. Quillian, Jr., U. S. Army Fuels &amp; Lubricants Research Lab. A method of cooling piston engines by direct injection of a fluid into the combustion chamber is described. Significant changes in power performance, fuel octane or cetane number requirements, exhaust emission quality, engine life, and engine configuration can be expected from injection cooling. This paper includes a theoretical discussion of the process and then presents a description of the laboratory apparatus and procedures and an evaluation of ex- perimental data. 700887. Engine Cooling by Direct Injection of Cooling Water. A. Modak, University of California, Berkeley.; and L. S. Caretto, Imperial College of Science &amp; Technology, England. A computer program has been developed to analyze the Otto cycle for an engine where water can be injected directly into the cylinder. The program can treat arbitrary amounts of water injection at any point in the cycle. Results show that a main factor is the timing of the water injection; optimum injection is early in the compression stroke. 700888. Railroading in the Seventies. P. V. Garin, Southern Pacific Transportation Co. If there is any one statement that could sum up the task of the railroads in the 1970s, it is that the industry must achieve technological breakthroughs of sufficient impor- tance to guarantee a greater role for rail transport in the national economy in the days ahead. The railroads, without question, will continue to be faced with the perennial problems of competition, oper- ating efficiency, safety, costs, regulation, and labor disputes. In the 1970s, however, these pressures will</page><page sequence="122">700889-700895 undoubtedly mount, due to rapidly shifting economic and social factors. The demands on managerial skills will be greater than ever, as will the need for vastly improved technology. 700889. Railroad Engine Power Assembly and Lubricating Oil Relationships. John G. Hoffman, Jr. and William W. Peters, General Electric Co. The authors trace the role of power assembly-lubricant developments in the application of the General Electric diesel engine from 194 - 283 psi BMEP. The experience presented covers the period from introduction in 1957 to the present on over 2800 engines. 700890. Oxygen Absorption Test for Evaluation of Ox- idation Stability of Railroad Oils. T. S. Chao, M. Kjonaas and B. C. Vitchus, Atlantic Richfield Co. By proper choice of operating conditions, an oxygen absorption test can be used to predict the oxidation stability of railroad oils in high severity diesel engines. This paper describes a modified oxygen absorption apparatus and the conditions chosen for testing railroad oils, and discusses the effects of soluble metal catalysts, the correlation between volume of 02 absorbed and various properties of used railroad oils, and correlation with engine tests. This test is also used to determine the effects of railroad oil additives and base oils on the oxidation stability of the lubricant. It involves circulation of oxygen through the oil at a controlled temperature and flow rate, in the presence of soluble metal catalysts, until a definite quantity of 02 has been consumed. The rate of 02 consumption is constantly monitored by a transducer. The equipment is semi-automatic in that it plots an 02 absorption curve automatically and shuts itself off when a preset quantity of 02 has been consumed. 700891. Lube Oil and Engine Design Compatibility - A Requirement for Achieving High Levels of Per- formance Reliability. J. J. Kotlin and J. A. Malina, Electro-Motive Div., General Motors Corp. This paper emphasizes the need for compatibility between lubricating oil characteristics and engine design to achieve high reliability goals. General oil characteristics found to be desirable in the General Motors 567 and 645 two- stroke diesel engines are reviewed. Specific examples are presented to illustrate where lube oil-engine design characteristics have presented barriers to achieving high reliability, and as a result, engine design changes were required to achieve new goals of compatibility between lube oil and engine design. 700892. Locomotive Radioactive Ring Studies of Fuel, Lubricant, and Operating Variables. T. A. Tennyson, Southern Pacific Transportation Co.; and C. K. Parker, Jr., Chevron Research Co. The use of the radioactive ring technique to study variables affecting railroad diesel engine wear was first reported by the Southern Pacific Transportation Co. and the Standard Oil Co. of California in 1961. Researchers from the same companies undertook new investigations in 1969 and 1970, using a current generation turbocharged locomotive. As in the previous program, the operation was carried out in a stationary installation with the generated power absorbed by auxiliary aircooled grids. New testing procedures and counting equipment were employed. Radioactive chromium was counted simul- taneously with the measurement of irradiated iron particles in the oil. New and used lubricants with variations in alkalinity value were evaluated, using distillate fuels with sulfur contents ranging 0-1%. Two ring metallurgy combinations were evaluated. 700893. Development of Air-Suspension Systems for Highway Tractors and Trailors. O. Lee Henry, Lear Siegler, Inc. Trailer air suspensions have been commonly applied to many segments of the highway transportation industry, since one or more of the unique characteristics of air suspensions solve particular operating problems. Recent developments in tractor drive axle air suspensions now permit application of the same basic characteristics to power equipment. In addition, with air suspensions available for both trailer and tractor, many new concepts in vehicle design and material handling become practical. The purpose of this paper is to generally review the characteristics of air suspensions, review the development of a drive-axle air suspension, and finally show how they are applied to over-the-highway heavy duty vehicles. 1970 SA E Transactions 700894. Air Ride Truck Suspension. A. D. McLean, Kenworth Motor Truck Div., Pacific Car &amp; Foundry Co. Air spring suspensions have reached a point in their development where they are quite dependable.

(P-33) The Reduction of Collisions Injuries: Past, Present, and Future. Alan M. Nahum, Arnold W. Siegel and Samuel Brooks, University of California, Los Angeles. The paper represents a distillation and analysis of collision injury cases collected by the UCLA Trauma Research Group from 1960-1969. Injuries are interpreted with relation to specific variables which are thought to represent important factors in collision injury causation and prevention. The methodology is presented as one possible way to view transportation trauma in terms of factors which can be isolated and may lend themselves to manipulation in the cause of traffic safety. 1970 SA E Transactions 197</page><page sequence="123">700896-700900 198 700896. (P-33) The Nature of Seat Belt Injuries. James S. Williams, University of Rochester. A study was made of the histories of accidents in which the victims were injured by safety belts. The three types of safety belts - lap, two point, and three point - each produced a characteristic injury pattern. Without re- straining systems, more of the accidents would have resulted in fatalities, but the safety belt injuries were often extremely severe. Statistics are given of the number and type of injury for each form of safety belt, and the conclusion is drawn that a combination of shoulder and lap belt is the most effective in preventing injury and mortality. 1970 SAE Transactions 700897. (P-33) Motorcycle Collision Experiments. Derwyn M. Severy, Harrison M. Brink and David M. Blaisdell, University of California, Los Angeles. Seven collision experiments were conducted, each with a motorcycle and rider striking the side of a passenger car. Speed at impact, size of motorcycle, and position impacted along the side of the passenger car represent the independent variables studied. The delivery system used for this series of motorcycle collisions is described, along with related methodology. Photographic and electronic instrumentation systems were used for obtaining essential engineering data. Findings include: 1. Body kinematics for a motorcyclist during collision. 2. Collision dynamics of the impacting vehicles, including measurements of maximum mutual collapse. 3. Deceleration values for the motorcycle and for the head, chest, and hips of the rider. 4. Peak acceleration values for the struck passenger vehicles and its occupant. 5. Calibration of damages sustained by car and motorcycle for impacts at known speeds and for specific sizes of motorcycles. In addition, specific recommendations are provided for reducing motorcyclists' exposure to injury. 700898. (P-33) Biomechanics of the Vertebral Column and Internal Organ Response to Seated Spinal Impact in the Rhesus Monkey (Macaca Mulatta). L. E. Kazarian, Aerospace Medical Res. Lab., U. S. Air Force.; J. W. Hahn, St. Louis Medicai School.; and H. E. von Gierke, Aerospace Medical Res. Lab., U. S. Air Force. Rhesus monkeys were anesthetized; radiographed; re- strained by lap belt, torso harness, and limb retention straps; positioned in an impact carriage; and exposed to + Gz seated rectangular acceleration-time histories from predetermined drop heights. The shock programmer used throughout these experiments was aluminum honeycomb. Pulse accelerations ranged 25-900 G and total time duration 2-22 ms. Shortly after impact, all primates were radiographed, killed, and a necropsy performed. Attempts were made to determine injury potential as a function of plateau acceleration and pulse duration for various target organs. Spinal injury data support previous results and theoretical considerations that there are two distinct injury potential regimes; one, for which the velocity change is the determining physical parameter, and the other for which peak g is the determining factor. Injuries observed in parenchymatous organs included external and surface hemorrhaging in the liver, lesions of the lung, and cardiac lesions. Their severity ranged from minor reversible abrasions to lethal trauma. These experiments strengthened confidence in the applicability of animal experiments to the quantitative explanation of human injury and to the extrapolation of animal results - after the application of the proper scaling factors - to human situations. 700899. (P-33) Protection from Brain Injury: The Relative Significance of Translational and Rotational Motions of the Head after Impact. Arthur E. Hirsch, National Highway Safety Bureau, U.S. Dept. of Trans.; and National Institutes of Health, Dept. of Health, Education &amp; Welfare. Ayub K. Ommaya The rotational and translational rigid body motions of the head after impact were evaluated by high-speed cine- matography in Rhesus monkeys with and without a cervical collar. When a collar was worn, animals displayed increased tolerance to occipital impact for the onset of cerebral concussion. Although head rotations were re- duced in this nonconcussed protected group, translational motion of the head exceeded that attained by concussed monkeys not wearing collars but struck at equivalent impulse levels. These data emphasize the inadequacy of current head impact tolerance criteria which relate the occurrence of brain injury to translational head motions. 700900. (P-33) Intracranial Pressure and Head Acceler- ation During Whiplash. Harold D. Portnoy and Durand Benjamin, Pontiac General Hospital.; Michael Brian, Lowell E. McCoy and Bruce Pince, Space/Defense Corp.; Robert Edgerton, Oakland University.; and Joseph Young, Fed- eral Aviation Administration. Baboons were whiplashed to measure intracranial pres- sure (ICP) in whiplash, to correlate ICP to linear and angular head acceleration, and to determine if head restraint configuration altered ICP. Clinical, biochemical, physiological, and pathological observations were made. Intracranial pressure increased in whiplashed ba- boons, and is temporally related to translational and rotational head accelerations. With different head re- straint configurations, the pressure increases are smallest when using a vertical restraint minimizing head move- ment, and are not reduced by partial restraints. There may be some correlation between EEG, clinical, and gross pathologic observations, and the use of the various</page><page sequence="124">700901-700904 restraints, but EKG, heart rate, and biochemical meas- urements were not significant. 700901. (P-33) Testing the Validity and Limitations of the Severity Index. V. R. Hodgson, L. M. Thomas and P. Prasad, Wayne State University. The head acceleration pulses obtained from monkey concussion, cadaver skull fracture (t = 0.002 sec) and football helmet experiments (0.006 &lt; t &lt; 0.011 sec) have been subjected to injury hazard assessment by the Severity Index method. Although not directly applicable, the method correlates well with degree of monkey concussion. The range of Severity Indices for acceleration pulses obtained during impact to nine cadavers, all of which produced a linear fracture, was 540-1760 (1000 is danger to life) with a median value of 910. The helmet ex- periments showed good correlation between the Severity Index and the Wayne State University tolerance curve. These helmet tests also showed that a kinematics chart with curves of velocity change, stopping distance, average head acceleration, and time, with superimposed Wayne State tolerance curve can be useful in injury assessment. The Vienna mathematical model of Slattenschek and Tauffkirchen proposed as an alternative method of hazard assessment to the Severity Index was tested with the football helmet data. Displacement response of the model increases relative to severity of impact and is in good agreement with predictions by the authors. It is shown that the Severity Index method does not apply to a metal head form. Discussion: Charles W. Gadd, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp-î Authors' closure 1970 SA E Transactions 700902. (P-33) Evaluation of Impact Test Accelerations: A Damage Index for the Head and Torso. J. Brinn and S. E. Staffeld, Chrysler Corp. The head Severity Index concept has attracted widespread attention in the automotive industry. This index is intended to estimate human survivability in a systematic way without relying on judgment values. It is employed for evaluating the probability of internal head injury for those indeterminate conditions where the human toler- ance limits are not clearly defined. This paper discusses a damage index which is believed to be superior to the current Severity Index in several respects: 5. It is more convenient to employ. The index is inherently insensitive to long, low amplitude pulses; it is also largely independent of signal filtering characteristics. 1. The concept is applicable to internal injuries of the torso as well as the head. 2. It is felt to describe the actual damage mechanism more directly. 3. It fits the Wayne State Head Tolerance Curve better than the Severity Index. 4. It is suitable for analyzing impact pulses of any time duration. Examples cited in this paper include rocket sled exposures (250 ms duration) down to severe head impacts (5 ms duration). This damage index is an extension of proposals made by other investigators. It employs a spring-mass model of the particular human organ under consideration; the input pulse is used as the forcing function and the displacement of the organ is calculated. This organ displacement is used as the parameter of damage. The displacement limit is set by employing input pulses which are known to approach the human tolerance limit. The analysis presented in this paper indicates that the displacements calculated in this manner are not overly sensitive to small errors in the determination of spring- mass values; thus the basic biomechanical data need not be highly refined. Future medical progress will ultimately determine the true suitability of this proposed index. It is felt, however, to be the most realistic basis for appraisals based on current knowledge. 700903. (P-33) Development of a Mechanical Model of the Human Head - Determination of Tissue Properties and Synthetic Substitute Materials. J. W. Melvin, J. H. McElhaney and V. L. Roberts, Highway Safety Research Institute, The Uni- versity of Michigan. A variety of mechanical headforms is used today in the evaluation of the crashworthiness of automotive interiors and the effectiveness of helmet designs. Most headforms are of a very rigid metallic construction, although frangible headforms that indicate skull fracture are presently available. None of the existing headforms can be considered a complete mechanical analog to the human head in terms of mechanical response. This paper describes the initial phases of the development of such a headform. The first step in the development of the model was the determination of pertinent mechanical properties of the tissues of the human head (scalp, skull bone, dura mater, and brain). A testing program which determined these properties at both static and dynamic strain rates is described and the results are summarized. The second phase of the program was to find and develop synthetic materials which duplicated the me- chanical properties of the human tissues. Many materials were investigated, and modifications to existing materials were made. The synthetic materials were tested by the same methods used in the human tissue tests. Results comparing the synthetic materials with their human tissue counterparts are given. Proposed simple procursor models are described and a discussion of future, more complex models is given, along with the specific types of head injury phenomena that the model will be required to simulate. 1970 SA E Transactions 700904.

Bendixen, T. D. Clarke, H. S. Klopfenstein and J. F. Sprouffske, 6571st Aeromedicai Res. Lab. Abrupt linear decelerations (-gx) were conducted with human volunteers in order to study the loading to the human anatomy while restrained with the lap belt, lap belt plus air bag, and Air Force harness systems. Impulses and peak forces in the lap belts and peak forces in the seat pan, seat back, and foot cells were measured and compared. Each subject was compared with himself using the different systems, and the range and mean of these comparisons are shown. The results indicated that in comparison with the lap belt only system, both the lap belt plus air bag and the Air Force harness systems significantly reduced the impulses and peak forces transmitted to the pelvis. 700905. (P-33) Baboon Tolerance to Linear Deceleration (-Gx): Air Bag Restraint. Thomas D. Clarke, James F. Sprouffske, Edwin M. Trout and C. D. Gragg, 6571st Aeromedicai Res.

The tolerance to abrupt linear deceleration (-gx) and the subject interaction with an air bag plus lap belt and air bag only restraint systems were investigated. Twenty adult male baboons comprised the test pool. Peak sled decel- erations ranged from 8.6-123 g. The results indicated that the tolerance to impact (LD50) utilizing an air bag with or without lap belt was in excess of 120 g. The severest injuries were attributable to the lap belt, and included rupture of the rectus abdominus and quadriceps femoris muscles plus diaphragmatic tearing. There were no significant injuries to subjects restrained with only an air bag. Excellent linear correlations were established between peak lap belt forces and maximum sled deceleration. Comparative evaluation of the air bag restraint with a previously reported lap belt study was made when applicable. 700906. (P-33) Baboon Tolerance to Linear Deceleration (-Gx): Lap Belt Restraint. Thomas D. Clarke, James F. Sprouffske, Edwin M. Trout, Harold S. Klopfenstein, William H. Muzzy, C. D. Gragg and Charles D. Bendixen, 6571st Aeromedicai Res. Lab., Holloman AFB. The tolerance to abrupt linear deceleration (-Gx) and the subject response to a lap belt restraint system were investigated. Nineteen adult male baboons comprised the test pool. The effects of impacts of 8.6 - 40 g were studied, with nonsurvivability used as the index of tolerance. The results indicated that the tolerance to impact (LD50) approximated a 32 g sled deceleration. Lethality was presumed attributable to the secondary impact as the head contracted the floor of the sled. Predominant lethal injuries included avulsion of the atlanto-occipital artic- ulation and dislocation fractures of the cervical vertebrae with resulting transection of the spinal cord. Excellent linear correlations were established between peak lap belt and seat pan forces versus maximum sled deceleration. Likewise, a linear relationship was found between peak head angular accelerations and maximum sled deceleration. 700907. (P-33) Predictions of Mathematical Models Com- pared with Impact Sled Test Results Using Anthropometric Dummies. D. H. Robbins, R. O. Bennett, A. W. Henke and N. N. Alem, High- way Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan. Mathematical models of the human body subjected to an impact environment have been developed by many research groups in industry, government, private research organizations, and universities. In most cases, the models have not been verified by or compared with experimental results. The purpose of this paper is to show comparisons between the two- and three-dimensional crash victim simulators, which have been developed at the Highway Safety Research Institute of the University of Michigan, and front and side impact sled test results using anthrop- ometric dummies. 1970 SA E Transactions 700908. (P-33) Third Generation of Automotive Test Dummies. Peter I. Maté and Leonard E. Popp, Sierra Engineering Co. To meet today's demands for a higher degree of accuracy and repeatability in automotive crash testing, a new advanced anthropometric dummy is under development. This third-generation test dummy is designed to be in a 90 deg seated position and complies with all require- ments of present SAE J963 specifications. The head is a completely new design. The skull, which is covered with a removable skin, is symmetrical for better test repeatability. The newly developed neck concept produces more human-like response. New materials used in the neck and the lower vertebrae eliminate ringing effects. The new shoulder assembly features better contour and muscle tone, and withstands the expected shoulder harness loads. The chest of the previous generation dummies is replaced with a plastic contoured rib cage of the required load deflection characteristics. To provide a better means of restraint system evaluation, the new pelvis is human-like in contour. For better simulation of muscle tone, more reliable friction setting of joints is included. Finally, for easier handling, the skin closure zippers are located in the rear and paddings are secured in place. 700909. (P-33) Fracture Behavior of the Skull Frontal Bone Against Cylindrical Surfaces. Voigt R. Hodgson, Wayne State University.; Jule Brinn,</page><page sequence="126">700910-700912 Chrysler Corp.; and L. M. Thomas and S. W. Greenberg, Wayne State University. A test program has been conducted to determine the fracture behavior of the human frontal bone against two different rigid cylindrical surfaces; one surface was of 1 in. radius and one was of 5/16 in. radius; both were 6 1/2 in. long. The purpose of this research program was to provide human tolerance data which would: 1. Assist in the design of structures likely to be impacted by the human head. 2. Extend the calibration range of frangible head- forms. Twelve cadavers were tested in this program; seven against the 1 in. radius cylinder and five against the 5%16 in. radius cylinder. The test arrangement employed a guided drop of the test surface against a stationary head which was free to rebound. Drop heights were increased progressively until borderline fractures were obtained. The large radius shape consistently yielded linear fractures indicating that it is effectively a blunt surface. Fracture loads ranged 950-1650 lb. The small radius shape yielded two linear fractures and three localized elliptical fractures indicating that it is in the transition range between a blunt and concentrated surface. Fracture loads ranged 700-1600 lb. 700910. (P-33) Tolerance and Properties of Superficial Soft Tissues in Situ. Charles W. Gadd, Research Labs., General Motors Corp.; Alan M. Nahum, University of California, Los Angeles.; and Dennis C. Schneider and Richard G. Madeira, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Utilizing unembalmed cadaver test subjects, a series of tests was carried out to characterize quantitatively the resistance of the skin, the soft underlying tissue of the scalp, and certain other typical areas of the body to impact loading. The impacts were delivered by the use of an instrument free-fall device similar to that previously employed for facial bone fracture experiments. In one group of tests, metal and glass edges were affixed to the impacting device to produce localized trauma under conditions which were standardized with respect to variables affecting the degree of the injury. In the second group of experiments, specimens of skin, together with underlying tissue of uniform thickness, were subjected to compressive impact between the parallel surfaces of the impacting weight and a heavy metal platen. From these latter experiments the force-time histories, coefficient of restitution, and hysteresis loops of load versus deflection were obtained for the specimens. It is suggested that the data obtained should be applicable to the evaluation of soft tissue injury hazard in accidents and to the appraisal of artificial soft tissue simulations for impact headforms and anthropometric dummies. 700911. (P-33) Tempered versus HPR Laminated Wind- shields: A Comparative Study of United Kingdom and the United States Collisions. G. M. Mackay, University of Birmingham, England.; and A. W. Siegel and P. V. Hight, University of California, Los Angeles. Data are presented from two field studies on the collision injuries which result from contact with tempered glass and 0.030 in. (0.76 mm) high penetration resistant (HPR) laminated glass windshields. Two sets of similar auto- mobile collisions are analyzed. The first set consists of European and Japanese cars imported into the United States (in Southern California). The second set is drawn from a study of British cars involved in collisions in England, all of which had tempered windshields. The frequency and severity of injury from the windshield are given for each set of collisions. Compar- isons are made on the basis of vehicle damage and equivalent impact speeds. Examples of the mechanisms of injury for the two types of glass are outlined. The data presented indicate that tempered windshields give rise to a higher incidence of injury and more severe injuries than the 0.030 in. HPR laminated windshields under similar impact conditions. These differences are statistically significant. The importance of severe injuries from the edges of shattered tempered windshields is discussed, together with injuries which result from the passing of occupants through the plane of the windshield to strike the car hood or cowl. Eye injuries from the two types of windshields are discussed, together with the effect on the injury mecha- nisms when the windshield becomes detached during the collision. 700912. (P-33) Serious Eye Injuries Produced by Wind- shield Damage - An Actual Problem in Oph- thalmology. K. Müller-Jensen and W. Hollweck, Augenklinik der Universität München. Eye injuries resulting from broken windshields are very frequent. The mechanism of such accidents reveals that the head of the passenger, about 0.1 sec after the crash, is thrown against the inner face of the windshield with a relative speed corresponding to the collision speed within a range of 60 km/hr. It often happens that the skull penetrates single-sheet safety glass, which is found in 95% of German vehicles. In these cases the eye region falls toward the lower breaking zone of the windshield, which leads to a very characteristic, often absolutely horizontal line of injury. Over a period of five years, of the 240 patients observed in the University Eye Hospital in Munich, 62 patients (26%) suffered bilateral eye injuries due to windshield particles. In practically all cases, lacerations and cuts of the eye lids were observed. In 65% of the cases, serious lacerations of the corneoscleral border of the eye bulb - affecting the lens, vitreious, and retina - were present. These perforating wounds led to blindness in 40% of the cases. In a period of 10 years, about 500 people became bilaterally-blind from road accidents in Germany. By introducing both three-point safety belts and high-impact laminated glass windshields, 201</page><page sequence="127">700913-700920 202 all eye injuries resulting from windshield splinters could more or less be eliminated. 700913. (P-35) Aircraft and Rocket Triggered Natural Lightning Discharges. Donald R. Fitzgerald, Air Force Cambridge Research Labs. Electrostatic field measurements in thunderstorms were obtained from the "Roughrider" F-100F aircraft, and from above storms with a U-2 aircraft. Analysis of data associated with lightning strikes to or near the aircraft indicates that most of the strikes occurred in a transition zone from positive over negative charge to the reverse as indicated by the vertical electric field component and that they occurred in or on the edge of an intense negative space charge concentration at flight level. These transition zones and charge centers are closely linked to the precipitation and draft structure in the cloud. Data taken at cloud base and on the surface has also been used to indicate conditions for rocket-triggered lightning. Small wirepulling rockets fired by LTRI were successful in triggering strokes at an altitude of several hundred feet when the over-water storm field was about 200 v/cm. The Apollo 12 vehicle triggered strokes at 6400 ft when the surface field was about 35 v/cm. Post-flight analysis of data obtained at Cape Kennedy and Patrick AFB indicates two or three natural intra- or inter-cloud lightning events had occurred within 30 km of the Cape in the 25 minute period prior to launch. 700915. (P-35) Model Studies of Stroke Probability to Selected Points on Aerospace Vehicles. J. R. Stahmann, Lightning &amp; Transients Research Institute. About sixty-six uniformly spaced fixed probed positions are usually used for a general study to determine the probability of lightning stroke contact to various points on a complete aerospace vehicle. More detailed studies are usually considered prohibitive because of the large number of discharges required. For estimating very low probability of contact for detailed studies of critical regions, probe positions can be restricted to the small solid angle from which contact is possible. Then, with a relatively small number of probe positions and enough discharges to measure statistical variations, a very low probability can be estimated with a limited number of discharges, typically about thirty. 700916. (P-35) Lightning and Static Hazards Relative to Airworthiness. B. L. Perry, Air Registration Board. The paper updates, and briefly extends, the statistical information on lightning strikes to aircraft given in the author's 1968 paper. The problems and potential dangers of both lightning strikes and static build-up on aircraft are discussed and illustrated with particular reference to airworthiness. Conclusions are drawn regarding problem and potential problem areas where further information is required and towards which research effort should be directed. In the light of the above, current and future air- worthiness requirements are considered. 700917. (P-35) Recent Developments in Lightning Pro- tection for Aircraft and Helicopters. J. D. Robb, J. R. Stahmann and M. M. Newman, Lightning &amp; Transients Research Institute. The testing of aircraft components for new aircraft has introduced problems in trying to meet the specifications with new materials and construction techniques. Sug- gested is a more detailed analysis of the lightning characteristics in order that tests may be more precisely defined for specific aircraft components as illustrated in swept stroke studies. Of increasing concern is the performance of more vulnerable electronics systems for new aircraft, and guidelines are developed for simple calculation of approximate electric and magnetic fields to determine pulse penetration into the vehicle electrical and electronic systems. Requirements for testing of all plastic helicopter blades are also suggested. 1970 SA E Transactions 700918. (P-35) Lightning Test Facilities Measurement Techniques. J. D. Robb, Lightning &amp; Transients Research Institute.; R. F. Huber, Joslyn Man- ufacturing &amp; Supply.; and C. J. Kawiecki, Joslyn Electronic Division. The increasing use of small artificial lightning generation facilities for developmental testing of aircraft components by the manufacturer has required the measurements of the test currents in the presence of the strong electromagnetic fields associated with the high current discharges. Special techniques are presented for the set up of the facility high current paths and for the use of measurement equipment such as the oscilloscopes and high current sensors to assure that reasonably accurate measurements of the current waveforms are obtained. 700919. (P-35) Microwave Noise Produced by Tribo- electric Charging. Larry E. Cummings, Air Force Avionics Lab., Wright-Patterson AFB. The generation of microwave noise (1-4 GHz) by tribo- electric charging of dielectric surfaces was produced to determine its magnitude. The noise spectrum is compared with that derived mathematically from collected pulse data. Charging currents are equivalent to those measured on large aircraft. Several different types of dielectrics are examined for generation of triboelectric noise. 700920. (P-35) A Study of Some Fundamental Helicopter Charging Mechanisms. M. E. Rogers, Royal Aircraft Establishment. Two fundamental helicopter charging mechanisms are discussed which have received relatively little attention in the past, namely, 'engine' and 'rain precipitation' charg- ing. In each case data collected as part of the Royal</page><page sequence="128">700921-700925 Aircraft Establishment's investigation programme are critically examined and working hypotheses are advanced to account for the generation process. In engines the process is seen as one of preferential trapping of ions previously separated by thermal ionisa- tion. For Whirlwind 10 helicopters where net positive currents are observed it is considered likely that this largely results from positively charged hydrocarbon neuclei colliding with the turbine blades. However because of the relatively small imbalance of ions captured, compared to the total generated by the thermal processes, it is accepted that other engines could exhibit different characteristics. The rain precipitation process is believed to be an induction effect which occurs when drops are shattered by impact with the rotor leading edge in the presence of an electric field. It is argued that such a process could explain the large variations in charging currents measured in these conditions as well as the frequent changes in polarity. Furthermore this mechanism would predict the observed close relationship between charging current and aircraft all-up-weight (AUW) for different helicopters hovering in identical conditions. In conclusion it is acknowledged that further work on these mechanisms is required to fully substantiate the theories put forward. 700921. (P-35) Studies of Supersonic Vehicle Electrifi- cation. J. E. Nanevicz and E. F. Vance, Stanford Research Institute. Theoretical and experimental studies of airborne vehicle electrification processes are described. Laboratory ex- periments with projectiles fired through an ice-fog cloud were used to study the variation of frictional charging with air speed at supersonic speeds. These experiments dem- onstrated that the charge imparted by each particle decreases with increasing speed at supersonic speeds, apparently because of ice crystal melting on impact. Flight instrumentation has been designed and fab- ricated to measure electrification parameters and effects on a supersonic test aircraft. The instrumentation meas- ures, charging rate, discharging rate, charge per particle, aircraft potential, streamer current and number of streamer pulses, variation of effective frontal area, and noise spectrum. The philosophy of the design and construction of the flight test experiments and equipment are discussed. The flight test instrumentation has been installed on an F-4 aircraft, and test flights are being conducted. 700922. (P-35) Waterfalls, Bathrooms and ~ Perhaps ~ Supertanker Explosions. E. T. Pierce, Stanford Research Institute. The electrical effects developed by Lenard splashing near waterfalls, under laboratory conditions, and within the closed environments of a bathroom and a cargo tank of oil supertanker during seawater washing operations, show a consistent phenomenology. Both theory and experimental evidence suggest that electrical conditions in the closed container atmospheres are defined by dN/dt Q/e -(10"3)N. In this equation, N is the number density of large charged carriers (large ions and haze droplets), t is time, and e the electronic charge. The rate of charge production, Q, is approximately -1012 coulomb per gram for the bathroom water and + 10n coulomb per gram for the seawater. These values correspond to number densities of some 105 per cm3 and spacecharge densities of ± IO8 coulomb per m3. The field within a closed container is approximately proportional to the product of the linear container dimension and the space-charge density. Conditions within an oil supertanker cargo tank during the washing operations are considered. It is concluded that the electrification is sufficiently intense for a large-scale spark streamer to have a good chance of developing. This chance-and therefore the explosion hazard-becomes larger with an increase in the size of the cargo tank. 700923. (P-35) Lightning Current Transfer Characteristics of the P-Static Discharger Installations. M. P. Amason and J. T. Kung, Douglas Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. This paper presents the results of p-static discharger installation lightning tests conducted by the Douglas Aircraft Company at its Long Beach, California facilities and the facilities of the Lightning and Transients Re- search Institute at Miami Beach, Florida. The paper discusses the lightning current transfer characteristics and lightning protection design consideration for the p-static discharger, the discharger retainer, and the aircraft installation. Laboratory lightning test results are also discussed in relationship with the in-service experience associated with natural lightning stroke incidents. 1970 SAE Transactions 700924. (P-35) Measurements and Analysis of Lightning- Induced Voltages in Aircraft Electrical Circuits. Paul T. Hacker, National Aeronautics and Space Administration.; and J. A. Plumer, General Electric Co. A series of measurements were made of voltages induced in electrical circuits within a metallic aircraft wing by full-scale simulated lightning currents flowing through its skin and structure. The measured data were mathe- matically analyzed to enable determination of voltages across load impedances to which the circuits might be connected elsewhere in the aircraft. Relationships between induced voltages and lightning current, wing structural and circuit parameters were determined. Induced voltages of magnitudes likely to cause damage or interference with avionics were measured. 1970 SAE Transactions 700925. (P-35) The Effects of Lightning Attachment Phenomena on Aircraft Design. R. O. Brick, L. L. Oh and S. D. Schneider, The Boeing Co. A working knowledge of swept lightning strikes has 203</page><page sequence="129">700926-700930 204 become a necessity for the aircraft designer involved in lightning protection of aircraft incorporating new struc- tural concepts that depart from the conventional riveted aluminum airframe. Swept strokes have been simulated in the laboratory to determine realistic protection criteria for components. Measurements of the maximum swept stroke dwell time on titanium and aluminum sheet are reported as well as an analysis of various techniques to improve the resistance of fuel tank skin panels to swept stroke effects. 1970 SAE Transactions 700926. (P-35) Electrostatic Charging and Noise Quieting. Robert L. Truax, Dayton Aircraft Products, Inc. It's known that aircraft in flight charge electrostatically due to triboelectric contact with precipitation, cross fields and ionization in engines. This charging can create broadband radio frequency noise due to streamer currents across non-conductive surfaces, corona discharge from the aircraft and arcing between structural members. In the past charging of an aircraft has been measured, noise sources identified and corrective steps applied. However, such efforts have been principally confined to large commercial and military jet aircraft. Cost had prohibited extensive system treatment of all noise sources preceded and followed by extensive flight test verification of charging phenomena and noise reduction measures. Smaller, General Aviation aircraft occupy the same flight environment and utilize the same airspace as transport and military aircraft. These aircraft also charge electrically. Noise sources are frequently even more tightly coupled to receiving antennas due to the physically small dimensions of General Aviation airplanes. A system approach was taken to identifying noise sources due to electrostatic charging, to measurement of charging levels, application of noise reduction techniques and flight test verification. Streamer currents to 40 microamperes were measured on plastic structural components, cross field stresses exceeding 100 KV/M were recorded and propeller corona currents were observed to exceed 50 microamperes per blade. Precipitation charging rates of 250 microamperes were encountered. One tip type discharger reached a 400 microampere discharge current on one occasion. Dis- charges of opposing polarities were observed from different aircraft extremities at the same time. A total discharge current of 2.5ma was occasioned. Steps were taken to reduce noise generation when the aircraft became charged electrically. These included installation of quiet dischargers, conductive coating of plastic frontal surfaces and use of dc sealed antennas. Actual flight tests demonstrated that with proper application of corrective measures useable navigation and communications could be retained in the most severe conditions encountered. Without the corrective measures, communications and navigation, through the VHF spec- trum, were lost for extended periods of time in actual flight. 1970 SAE Transactions 700928. (P-35) Influence of Lightning and Static Elec- tricity as Applied to Helicopter Design. B. John Solak, The Boeing Co. As recently as 1968 there was not a single case on record of lightning striking a helicopter and it was difficult to obtain funds to support a research toward development of lightning protection. This situation changed in 1969-70. One helicopter was destroyed by a lightning strike, with loss of life; another was hit on the ground with substantial blade damage. So the interest in lightning and static electricity lost some- what it's "academic only" stamp. This paper reviews three basic domains of static electricity, affecting helicopter, namely: 1. Protection of the rotor blade against the effects of lightning strike. 2. Cargo hook operation and connected with it the problem of active equalization of potential between the cargo and the cargo handler. 3. Passive static electricity dischargers as a method to radio interference reduction. All three domains affect the whole blade design with emphasis on the design of the blade tip. 1970 SAE Transactions 700929. (P-35) Lightning Protection for Non-Metallic Rotor Blades. J. R. Stahmann, Lightning &amp; Transients Research Institute.; and G. I. Hackenberger, Jr., Kaman Aerospace Corp. This paper discusses general approaches to the design of lightning protection system for non-metallic helicopter rotor blades. Possible effect of stroke currents on conducting parts external and internal to the blade are mentioned, and general recommendations are made for disposition of protective materials. Testing of any such design is considered a necessity. A specific example is described, tracing the development of the protective system for one particular non-metallic rotor blade. 700930. (P-35) Lightning Protection on Advanced Fighter Aircraft. G. L. Weinstock, McDonnell Aircraft Co. The lightning design challenges and protective measures being used or considered for use on late models of the F-4 Phantom II aircraft, advanced air superiority aircraft and electronic flight control systems are presented in this paper. Ideally, if an aircraft were constructed of high electrically- conductive material and had no electro- magnetic openings in the skin, lightning would strike one area and leave by another without damaging the aircraft. For practical aircraft protection, lightning discharges must be prevented from entering the aircraft interior and damaging electrical and electronic systems, causing possible fuel system explosions, and affecting crew capabilities. Openings in the aircraft skin such as radomes, canopies, camera windows, navigation lights, fuel vents, composite materials, atmospheric sensors and unbonded sections all reduce the capability of aircraft to withstand</page><page sequence="130">700931-700935 lightning strikes. Unfortunately, advanced fighter aircraft incorporate all these electromagnetic openings. Additional lightning protection requirements have been necessitated by the introduction of electronic flight control systems (a replacement for the mechanical linkage and wire rigging used in present aircraft). Even a temporary loss of electrical power or an induced transient in an electronic flight control system would present a serious flight hazard. Since the system effectiveness of advanced fighter aircraft depends upon increased accuracy and range of their Fire Control Radars, present day methods of radome protec- tion using metallic strips are not usually acceptable. Size, weight, crew visibility, and corrosion prevention are other items critical to high performance fighter aircraft with which lightning protection must be made compatible. 700931. (P-35) Lightning and Surge Protective Devices for Survivability of Electrical Systems. C. J. Kawiecki, W. H. Kapp, W. T. Pranke, H. J. Steinhoff and R. E. Thompson, Joslyn Elec- tronic Systems. The proper functioning of an aircraft depends upon the reliability of its electrical systems. Circuit pollution by foreign electrical pulses endangers the survival of essential systems. Natural surges such as lightning, and equipment self-generated surges cannot be avoided entirely, but their effects can be minimized using appropriate lightning and surge protective devices. The surge problem is difficult to cope with; designers often ignore or postpone the problem for lack in knowledge both as to its definition and what to do about it. A cursory treatment of one kind of protector, using sparkgap devices, is presented here for protection against direct and induced lightning strikes, electromagnetic pulses, static charges and equipment self-generated surges. 700932. (P-35) Voltages Produced by Transient Currents Flowing Upon Shields of Cables. F. A. Fisher, General Electric Co. Electromagnetic disturbances to aircraft and to aerospace and industrial ground facilities often produce large circulating currents in the shields of electrical cables. The electromagnetic disturbances may be caused by lightning, switching of high voltage circuits or by other electro- magnetic effects. This paper presents experimental data showing how surge voltages are related to the type of construction of the cable, to the material of the cable shield, to magnitude and waveshape of the shield current and the type of termination of the shield. Special attention is given to industrial grade metal circuit since conduit, particularly the rigid steel variety, can have very effective shielding properties. 1970 SA E Transactions 700933. (P-35) Protection of Ground Space Facilities from the Effects of Lightning. F. A. Fisher and T. J. Blalock, General Electric Co. Aerospace and ground facilities are often both extensive in area and located in regions of high lightning activity. While the hazards of fire, explosion, and electrocution caused by direct lightning strokes are generally well recognized, the indirect effects of lightning on electrical and electronic systems are less well recognized. Electronic systems can often be damaged even by lightning strokes that do not hit the buildings or electrical wiring directly. The lightning hazards to electronic systems are often compounded by shielding and grounding practices used for control of lower frequency electromagnetic interfer- ences. These shielding and grounding practices are sometimes diametrically opposite to those that should be employed for control of lightning effects. This paper first describes the conflicts, real and apparent, between the grounding and shielding requirements for control of lightning and EMI. It discusses some ways to resolve these conflicts and draws upon a case history to illustrate the points raised. 1970 SA E Transactions 700934. (P-35) Lightning Protection for Dielectric Com- posites. J. D. Robb, Lightning &amp; Transients Research Institute. Dielectric composites are analyzed in terms of direct damage from shock waves, damage from longer duration slower presures from vaporization of dielectric or metallic solids, direct magnetic forces and burning from long duration low current continuing components. Studies have included piezo blast gage pressure measurement and Schleiren photography of the shock waves in the labo- ratory and pressure measurements of triggered natural lightning discharges. Theoretical and experimental anal- ysis of probable maximum shock pressures, magnetic forces and slower pressures indicate that the principal problem is introduced through long arcs developed inside sections and that the best general solution for providing lightning protection is still to keep the lightning discharge currents on the aircraft exterior or provide conductors with sufficient cross sectional area to carry the current where the currents must penetrate the aircraft. 1970 SA E Transactions 700935. (P-35) Lightning Protection for Advanced Com- posite Aircraft Structures. G. T. Woodrum, Air Force Materials Lab., Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Various composites, such as boron/epoxy, fiberglass/ep- oxy, and graphite/epoxy, have been used in aircraft structures and have been subject to damage by lightning. Some protection from such damage is necessary, espe- cially when the composites are used in combination with metallic sandwich substructures. The paper discusses attempts to alleviate lightning damage. Various types of metallic protection were evaluated, and an aluminum-filled coating seemed to provide the most effective and economic protection. The effect of lightning on composite hardware pro- grams, especially stabilizers, is also discussed. It was 205</page><page sequence="131">700936-700939 206 found that a conductive path could be made from the stabilizer to the fuselage, thus giving some protection from lightning. 1970 SA E Transactions 700936. (P-35) Lightning Protective Coatings for Boron and Graphite Fiber Reinforced Plastics. John G. Breland, Jr., Air Force Materials Lab.; and John T. Quinlivan and C. J. Kuo, The Boeing Co. Coatings and thin conductive overlays for protecting boron fiber reinforced plastics and graphite fiber rein- forced plastics from structural damage by simulated lightning strikes were investigated. Laboratory tests were made in which test panels, with and without coatings, were exposed to currents as high as 200,000 amperes. The greatest protection of the panels from damage, combined with minimum coating weight, was achieved with alu- minum wire fabric and aluminum foil overlays. Other protective coatings which had merit were: plasma sprayed aluminum; conductive paints used with aluminum foil strips; and conductive coatings applied over high dielec- tric strength plastic films. 1970 SA E Transactions 700937. (P-35) Fundamental Investigations of High In- tensity Electric Current Flow, Processes and Resultant Damage in Advanced Composites. Allen P. Penton and John L. Perry, Philco-Ford Corp.; and Kenneth J. Lloyd, General Electric Co. The paper presents conclusions drawn from investigations of the damage mechanisms and current flow processes involved in the flow of high-intensity electric current through advanced composite materials. Filaments and epoxy resin composites of boron and graphite filaments were used in an attempt to establish a relationship between the responses of these composites and the characteristics of high-intensity currents. Conclusions are offered concerning this relationship, showing limiting factors in the degradation of the composites. It was determined that the controlling factors in the degree of degradation are the total electric energy input and the fraction of that input dissipated as heat. 1970 SA E Transactions 700938. (P-35) Aspects of the Apollo 12 Lightning Inci- dent. Donald D. Arabian, Manned Spacecraft Center, NASA. Before the Apollo 12 mission, the effects of lightning on a space vehicle were considered only for the period prior to flight. Methods and procedures for coping with possible lightning strikes while the vehicle was on the ground have been in existence since the inception of the launch complex. The possibility of the vehicle becoming involved with lightning after lift-off was not a launch consideration, unless natural lightning activity was present near the launch site. This paper discusses the significant elements of the lightning incident during the Apollo 12 launch. The paper describes what happened, why it happened, and what meteorological conditions could produce lightning with the presence of the launch vehicle. The action taken to minimize the possibility of creating a similar incident during future Apollo flights is presented. 1970 SA E Transactions 700939. (P-35) The Problem of Lightning and Static Electricity at the Kennedy Space Center. Ernest A. Amman, Kennedy Space Center, NASA. Lightning and static electricity represent a significant hazard at the Kennedy Space Center to many operations. Aside from the risks to personnel, facilities, and schedules, the financial aspects of failing to minimize the effects of lightning are very significant. Special instrumentation is in continuous use to monitor the lightning threat and facilitate predicting lightning events. The event of trig- gered lightning which accompanied the launch of Apollo Twelve has been the subject of prolonged investigation and discussion. New Mission Rules were adopted to lessen the risk of a repeat of that incident. Investigations are in progress to assess the possibility of discharging clouds for a significant period of time. The matter of lightning interference will probably become more critical with the development and oper- ational use of shuttle type spacecraft, since the use of such vehicles will probably require something near an all- weather capability.</page></plain_text>
