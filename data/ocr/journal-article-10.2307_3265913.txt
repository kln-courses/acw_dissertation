<plain_text><page sequence="1">JBL 98/1 (1979) 85-100 CRITICAL NOTES THE MORE SAVORY OFFERING: A KEY TO THE PROBLEM OF GEN 4:3-5 Prof. Judah Goldin in a lively and persuasive article entitled "The Youngest Son or Where Does Genesis 38 Belong?" (JBL 96 [1977] 27-44, especially 32-33) touches upon the old, unsolved question why the LORD accepted Abel's offering from the firstlings of his flock and their fat but not Cain's offering from the produce of the earth. A long footnote, moreover, surveys the commentators who have tried to explain the LORD's preference. For all their diversity, they share an assumption that the preference must have been rational, not capricious. But finding no obvious justification for it in the passage itself, they are obliged to bring in other ideas, which can be summarized as follows (from Goldin's references). (1) What grows spontaneously is a more appropriate sacrifice than what has to be cultivated. (2) Similarly, God approves of the pastoral life rather than the agricultural. (3) Cain's fruit (81) was notfirst fruit ('"l::); Abel's was indeed nn'::. (4) Cain offered flax-seed, an inferior product. (5) He was greedy and niggardly. No doubt there is an ounce of sense in each of these arguments. But they leave out an essential though simple-minded question, Which kind of food smells better? If we could read a book from the past not only with our eyes but with the other senses alert, they would often suggest an interpretation that is elementary and satisfactory at the same time. Abel had fat sizzling with its rich odor; Cain had cereal food baking, boiling, or frying in oil-perhaps with leavening, perhaps without it. Who would not be attracted to Abel's feast rather than Cain's? So the LORD's reaction was quite straightforward. If any deeper meaning was intended, it is not to supersede the naive one that he liked meat better. Cf. Gen 8:20-21, where he sniffs the soothing or propitiating aroma (rnnrn rrn) from Noah's holocausts and says to himself, "I will never again curse the ground on account of man." The commentators, whether Jewish or Christian, could hardly escape the pervasive influence of that anti-anthropomorphic theology which is traceable at least as far back as Xenophanes, the Greek philosophical poet of the sixth century B.C. (see especially his fragments 10-13, 19-22 Diehl). However, the Bible itself is not anti-anthropomorphic except in a practical way-thus the commandment against actually making an image and worshipping it (Ex 20:4-5). Otherwise the Bible is far from describing God as if he were a sage, too exalted to indulge in mere sensory perception and appetite.
