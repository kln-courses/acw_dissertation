<plain_text><page sequence="1">A STUDY OF THE GREEK TRANSLATION OF THE HEBREW VERBS "TO SEE", WITH DEITY AS SUBJECT OR OBJECT Charles Τ. Fritsch Princeton Theological Seminary A. Marmorstein introduces his classic work, Essays in Anthropomorphism,1 with the following words: 'The Jewish religion is classed with anthropomorphic religions No system of religious thought, or forms of religious life, can be separated from anthropomorphic or an thropopathic conceptions They endowed men with spiritual strength and opened higher ways of thought leading to religious enlightenment. How ever useful and necessary these modes and expressions of religious instruction have been and still are, they were bound to produce drawbacks. Disadvantages grew up which made themselves felt very early and very strongly in the synagogues and schools of the Jews. Historical causes (and changing theological climate) are responsible for such an early opposition to, and such a strong criticism of, an anthropomorphic and an thropopathic presentation of the divine character of God.' In every stage of the long history of Jewish Scripture and tradition some evidence of this spiritualizing (or antianthropomorphic) tendency may be found. Most of our handbooks on Old Testament Introduction, for example, characterize the Ε document as less anthropomorphic than J, which may reflect a kind of midrashic exegesis or commentary on the earlier source. The monoton ous repetition of the terms 'likeness' and 'appear ance' in the first chapter of Ezekiel (also 8:2,10:1) clearly indicates a new emphasis in the exilic and post-exilic times on the transcendence or 'otherness'2 of God. The sopherim, in their work on the transmission of the text, were careful to eliminate or change certain words or phrases which they thought were objectionable to the deity (tiqqune Sopherim), and they probably made the change from the Qal to the Niph'al of the verb 'to see' in the cultic phrase 'to appear before the deity', which change is already represented in the LXX.3 Pharisees and Sadducees disagreed as to whether God could be seen or not. The former denied that God could be seen, whereas the latter believed that God did appear in visible form.4 In fact, all through the Tannaitic and Amoraic periods of Jewish history the rabbis disputed among themselves concerning the literal (an thropomorphic) and allegorical interpretation of Scripture. (Marmorstein devotes his abovemen tioned book to the discussion of these controver sies.) By the use of intermediaries, circumlocutions, paraphrases and so on, the various Targums show an aversion to anthropomorphisms out of defer ence to God's glory and honor. But this procedure was not consistently carried out.5 We might also mention here that Samaritan theology made a strong effort to avoid an thropomorphic descriptions and conceptions of God.6 In Alexandrian Judaism stress was laid on the allegorical interpretation of Scripture. Aris tobulus, for instance, the Jewish philosopher who lived in the first half of the 2nd century BC, explained away the anthropomorphisms of the biblical narrative by allegorizing the text. He warns Ptolemy against taking literally the passages of Scripture which ascribe to the purely spiritual God hands and arms and face and feet, and calls</page><page sequence="2">52* CHARLES Τ. FRITSCH upon him to accept the philosophical interpreta tion of the Scriptures. In Philo we have the culmination of allegorical exegesis applied to Torah in a systematic way. For him God can have no form and by his very nature can not be seen. Into this milieu was born the LXX to serve the spiritual needs of the Jews in Alexandria. Although the great majority of anthropomorph isms in the Hebrew text are still found in the Greek translation, there are many places where the translators have tampered with the text for theological reasons. In this study we shall show how the LXX translates the various Hebrew verbs 'to see' — ראה חזה נבט שור שעה שקף — where the deity is either subject or object. I. The Deity Sees (Looks) In the great majority of cases the Hebrew verbs 'to see' with the deity as subject are translated literally into Greek. I have collected over sixty examples of these literal translations in the Greek, and the list is probably not complete. One example of the literal translation into Greek of each Hebrew verb noted above is given here: Ex. 2:25 ראה / εττιδειν. ראה with deity as subject is found far more frequently than any of the other verbs noted above. Ps. 10(LXX)11(M):4 חזה / αποβλέπω (eyes [of God] see). There are no examples in the Old Testament of חזה with deity as subject. Ps. 101(102): 20 נבט / επιβλέπω. Job 35:13b שור / ορατής. Gen. 4:4b שעה / επιδειν. Ps. 13(14): 2 שקף / διακόπτω. There are about fifteen instances, however, where the Greek translation avoids the idea of the deity 'seeing'. This small number of examples found throughout the Old Testament and the lack of any consistent method in dealing with the problem indicate that the idea of the deity 'seeing' posed no serious theological problem for the translators of the Old Testament into Greek. There are two places where the verb 'to see' with God (pronoun) as subject is omitted in the LXX: Is. 18:4:1) אשקוטה ואביטה במכוני will be quiet and look from my dwelling) / ασφαλεια εσται εν τη εμη πολει (safety will be in my city). Jer. 12:3: ידעתני תראני ובחנת (you know me. you see me, and you try...) / γι,νωσκεις με, δεδοκιμακας (you know me, you tried.. .).7 Four times the LXX renders Hebrew verbs for 'seeing' with God as subject by the Greek verbs 'to know, perceive, regard': Gen. 4: 5a:ואל־קיו ואל־מנחתו לא שעה (and for Cain and his offering He had no regard [He did not look with favor upon]) / εττι δε Καιν και επι ταιε θυσιαις αυτου ου προσεσχεν (but to Cain and his sacrifices He paid no attention).8 Job 28:24b: תחת כל־השמים יראה (He sees everything under the heavens) / ειδως τα εν τη γη τταντα (knowing all things in the earth). Ps. 93(94): 9b: אס־יצר עין הלא יביט (He who formed the eye, does he not see?) I η ο 7τλασας οφθαλμούς, ου κατανοεί (or he who formed the eyes, does he not perceive?). Jer. 20:12: ראה כליות ולב (He who sees the kidneys and the heart) / συνιων νεφρούς και καρδίας (He who knows the kidneys and hearts). The idea of deity 'looking away from' is expressed in several ways in the LXX: Job 7:19a:כמה לא־תשעה ממני (how long will you not look away from me?) / εως τίνος ουκ εας με (how long will you not let me alone). Ps. 38(39): 14: השע ממני (look away from me) / ανες μοι (let me alone).9 Job 14:6: שעה מעליו (look away from him) / αττοστα a77'αυτου (turn away from him). Is. 63:15: הבט משמים (look from heaven) / επιστρεψον εκ του ουρανου (turn from heaven). In the following examples the idea of the deity 'seeing' is not found in the rather free translation of the Hebrew into the Greek: Job 34:21b: וכל־צעדיו יראה (and He sees all his steps) / λεληθεν δε αυτόν ουδέν ων 7τρασσουσιν (and nothing that they do escapes him). Job 37:24b: לא-יראה כל־חכמי־לב (He does not see all the wise of heart) / φοβηθησεται δε αυτόν και 01 σοφοί καρδία (the wise of heart will fear him). The translators read ירא (to fear) for ראה (to see), and made 'all the wise of heart' the subject. Ps. 16(17) :2: עיניך תחזינה מישרים (let thine eyes see the right) / 01 οφθαλμοί μου ιδετωσαν</page><page sequence="3">GREEK TRANSLATION OF HEBREW VERBS 'TO SEE' WITH DEITY AS SUBJECT/OBJECT 53* ευθύτητας (let my eyes behold uprightness). The change of the pronoun 'thy' (M) to 'my' (LXX) removes the idea that God has eyes to see. In Hosea there are two places where the verb שור (to look, regard, lie in wait), with God as subject, is read differently by the translators of the LXX: Hos. 13:7: כנמר על"דרך אשור (like a leopard I will lie in wait by the way) / και ως τταρδαλις κατα την οδην Λσσυριων (and like a leopard on the way of the Assyrians). LXX read אשור, interpreting it as the Seleucids? Hos. 14:9: אשורנו (and I look after him) / και κατισχύσω αυτόν (and I will strengthen him). Did the translator associate the three radicals שור with the word for 'ox, bullock'(שור), from which he derived the idea of strength? In Dt. 32:20 the Qal אראה (I [God] will see) is read as a Hiph'il by the translator: אראה (I will show). In Lam. 3:36 the LXX has ειττον (He said) for the Heb. ראה (he saw — ειδεν), either an inner Greek corruption or dittography from the next line in the LXX.10 II. Seeing the Deity As seen in the Introduction to this paper God's visibility was a problem for Jewish theologians and philosophers since the time of the Second Temple. Already in ancient Israel the idea prevailed that any one who saw God had to die. Ex. 33:20 is the classic expression of this belief: 'man shall not see me and live.' Cf. also Ex. 19:21 and Lev. 16:2 where the same warning is expressed. There were some, however, who saw God and were graciously spared death: Jacob (Gen. 32:20), Moses and the elders (Ex. 24:11), Gideon (Jud. 6:22), and the parents of Samson (Jud. 13:22-23).11 Paradoxically, howver, 'seeing' the deity or his face is a rather common experience in the Old Testament, whether in visions or theophanies or on other occasions, or in worship. Cf. Ps. 27:8 where the worshipper is enjoined to seek the face of the Lord, and Ps. 42:2b where the worshipper longs to see the face of the deity (RSV). In the LXX there are about twenty places where the idea of 'seeing' the deity or his face is translated literally in the Greek. For example: I Kings 22:19: ראיתי את־יהוה (I have seen the Lord) / ειδον θεον Ισραελ (I saw deity of Israel). Does the anarthrous θεον tone down the idea of 'seeing' the Lord? Amos 9:1: ראיתי את־אדני (I saw the Lord) / ειδον τον κυρών (I saw the Lord). Is. 6:1: ואראה את־אדני (and I saw the Lord) / ειδον τον κυρών (I saw the Lord). The translators do not change the vision experience of seeing the deity in these examples. Cf. also Job 42:5. The following examples show how the LXX avoided the idea of 'seeing' the deity or his face in the Greek translation. I have divided these examples into three main categories according to the ways the Hebrew was changed for theological reasons. A. The context is changed Ex. 3:6: כי ירא מהביט אל־האלהים (for he [Moses] was afraid to look at God) / ευλαβε lto υαρ κατεμβλεψαί ενωτηον του θεου (for he was afraid to look before god). 'Before God' (LXX) instead of 'to God' (M) to express reverence. Ex. 24:10: ויראו אלהי ישראל (and they saw the God of Israel) / και ει δον τον τοττον ου ιστηκει, ο θεός του Ισραελ (and they saw the place where the God of Israel stood). Targs. have 'glory' instead of 'place'. Aqu. is literal; Sym. adds 'in a vision'. Ex. 24:11: ויחזו את־האלהים (and they saw God) / και ωφθησαν εν τω τοττω του θεου (and they appeared in the place of God). Targs. insert 'glory'. Here in LXX the verb is changed (to passive) and the context is altered. Num. 12:8: תמנת יהוה יביט (and the form of the Lord he beholds)/ καιτην δοξαν κυρωυ ειδεν (and the glory of the Lord he saw). Targs. have the 'likeness of the glory...'. Philo categori cally denies form to God, De Mutatione Nominum V (Loeb), 169. I Sam. 28:13: 1) אלהים ראיתי עלים מו־הארץ see a god [RSV; gods KJV] coming up from the earth) / θεούς εορακα αναβαίνοντας εκ της γης (I saw gods coming up from the earth). Even though the next verse describes only one</page><page sequence="4">54* CHARLES Τ. FRITSCH figure, LXX translates אלהים as plural to avoid any connection with God. is. 38:11:לא אראה יה בארץ החיים (I will not see the Lord in the land of the living) / ουκετυ μη ίδω το σωτήρων του θεου επί της γης ζωντων (I shall no more see the salvation of God in the land of the living). I.L. Seeligmann remarks in The Septuagint Version of Isaiah, London 1948, 115: 'the famous biblical anthropomorphism "to behold God" is rendered by "to see the deliverance of God".'The deliverance may refer to Hezekiah's recovery from his illness, or to a general act of Israel's salvation by God. Cf. the gloss on this passage found in B: ovkstl μη ίδω το σωτήρων του Ισραελ εττί της γης, where the deliverance is definitely that of Israel's.12 B. The verb 'to see'is changed Ex. 19:21b:פו־יהרסואל־יהוה לראות (lest they break through to the Lord to see) / μη ττοτε εγγίσωσίν ■προς τον θεον κατανοησαί (lest perchance they come near to God to perceive). A good translation of the verb 'to see' into Greek, but not a literal rendering. Dt. 31:15: וירא יהוה באהל (and the Lord appeared in the tent) / και κατεβη κυρως εν νεφελη (and the Lord came down in a cloud). Cf. Num. 11:25 and 12:5 where the verb 'came down' is used of the Lord in Μ and LXX. I Sam. 3:21: ויסף יהוה להראה בשלה (and the Lord appeared again at Shiloh) / και 7τροσεθετο κυρως δηλωθηναι εν Σηλωμ (and the Lord was again revealed at Shiloh). Job 19:26-27. This passage bristles with difficult problems, most of which we shall not discuss in this paper. Of special interest for our subject is the observation that Job asserts three times in these two verses that he, and he alone, shall see God. In each of these instances the Greek translation avoids this anthropomorphic expression in one way or another. 19:26b: ומבשרי אחזה אלוה (and from my flesh I shall see God) / 7ταρα γαρ κυρωυ ταύτα μ0ί συνετελεσθη (for from the Lord these things are done to me). LXX read משדי for מבשלי, and אלה for אלוה. The verb 'to see' was omitted in the Greek, unless היה 'to befall, happen' was read for חזה 'to see'. 19:27a: אשר אני אחזה לי (whom I shall see for myself)/ α εγω ε μαντώ συνε πισταμαι (which [things] I understand for myself). אשר refers back to ταύτα, not God. Verb 'to see' is changed in Greek 'to understand'. 19:27b: ועיני ראו ולא זר (and my eyes shall see [God], and not another) I α ο οφθαλμος μου εορακεν και ουκ aAA09(which [things] my eye has seen and not another), a refers to ταύτα of vs. 26, and so God is not seen. Job 23:9a:ולא אחז (and I do not see [Him])/ και ου κατεσχον (and I did not comprehend [Him].13 Job 33:26: וירא פניו בתרועה (and he saw His face with joy) / εισελευσεται δε προσωπω ιλαρω συν εξηγορια (and he will enter with a cheerful countenance and with thanks). If this is a cultic act, the LXX usually reads the Niph'al of ראה (appear before His face, or before God, so Syriac); otherwise it can be an expression of pure joy because of the release from suffering. Ps. 33(34) :6:הביטו אליו ונהרו (look to Him and be radiant) / 7τροσελθατε προς αυτόν και φωτισθητε (come to Him and be enligh tened). is. 17: 7a:ביום ההוא ישעה האדם על־עשהו (in that day man will look upon his Maker) / τη ήμερα εκείνη πεποιθως εσται ο άνθρωπος επι τω 7τοιησαντι αυτόν (in that day man shall trust in his Maker). Did the Hebrew verb שעה 'to look' remind the translator of the verb שען 'to lean upon, fig., to trust' (cf. Is. 10:20, Mic. 3:11), thus avoiding the anthropomorphic phrase 'to see God'? is. 31: id:ולא שעו על־קדוש ישראל (and they do not look to the Holy One of Israel) / και ουκ ησαν πεποιθοτες επι τον αγιον του Ισραελ (and they did not rely on the Holy One of Israel). See the preceding example for a possible explanation of the Greek translation. Zech. 9:14a: ויהוה עליהם יראה (and the Lord will appear over them) / και κύριος εσται επ' a1'rou9(and the Lord shall be against them). The following two verses present special problems: Num. 24:17a: 1) אראנו ולא עתה אשורנו ולא קרוב</page><page sequence="5">GREEK TRANSLATION OF HEBREW VERBS 'TO SEE' WITH DEITY AS SUBJECT/OBJECT 55* shall see him, but not now; I shall behold him, but not nigh) / δείξω αυτο, και ουχ νυν, μακαρίζω, και ουκ εγγίζει, (I shall show to him, and he is not now; I make [him] happy, and he is not near). The problem here is the identification of the pronoun 'him'. Is it Israel (with many commentators), or a vague royal future figure (Noth)? In any event both verbs are read differently by the translators: אךאנו for אךאנו, and אשורנו is connected with the root אשר 'be happy'. Why the Hebrew verbs 'to see' were avoided in the Greek is unclear, unless the translator took the 'him' to refer to some future divine figure, or even Messiah. II Chron. 26:5: זכריהו המבין בראות האלהים (Zechariah who instructed him [Uzziah] in the vision [or, seeing] of God) / Ζαχαρωυ του συνωντος εν φοβω κυρωυ (of Zachariah who instructed him in the fear of the Lord). Most versions and commentators read ביךאת (e.g. LXX), and so avoid the anthropomorphic expression 'seeing God'. C. The verb 'to see' is rendered as a passive (1) General Job 22:14: ולא יראה (and not does He see) / καί ουχ οραθησεταί (and not shall He be seen). Ps. 16(17): 15a: אני בצדק אחזה פניך (as for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness) / εγω δε εν δίκαίΟσυν-η οφθησομαί τω ττροσωττω σου (but as for me, let me appear in righteousness before thee). Ps. 62(63): 3a: כן בקדש חזיתו (so I have seen thee in the sanctuary) / ούτως εν τω αγίω ωφθην σοί (thus I appeared to thee in the sanctuary). The latter two examples are not describing the cultic experience of appearing before God in the temple, as in the following section. Rather these are describing the inner contemplation or vision (חזה) of the deity. (2) Cultic use of verb 'to see' in Passive Voice. Ex. 23:15: ולא יראו פני ריקם (and they shall not appear before me empty-handed) / ουκ οφθηση ενώπιον μου κενός (thou shalt not appear before me empty). Cf. Ex. 34:20; Dt. 16:16b. Ex. 23:17:שלש פעמים בשנה יראה כל־זכורך 14אליפני האדון יהוה (three times in the year shall all your males appear before the Lord God) / τρεις καιρούς του ενιαυτου οφθησεται παν αρσενικον σου ενώπιον κυρίου του θεου σου (three times a year shall all your males appear before the Lord thy God). Cf. Ex. 34:23; Dt. 16:16a. Ex. 34:24: 15לראות את־פני יהוה אלהיד (to appear before the Lord your God) / οφθηναι εναντίον κυρίου του θεου σου (to appear before the Lord your God). I Sam. 1:22: 16ונו־אה את־פני יהוה (that he may appear before the Lord) / και οφθησεται τω προσωπω κυρίου (and he shall appear before the Lord). Ps. 41 (42): 3: ואראה פני אלהים (and I shall appear before God) / και οφθησομαι προσωπω του θεου (and I shall appear before God). According to most scholars the original vowel pointing of ראה was Qal in the passages just cited in part II, C2, as in the expression of coming into the presence of royalty (e.g., II Sam. 3:13, and many other examples). The original Qal of the verb is reflected in the infinitive form לראות (with Niph'al vowel points) in Ex. 34:24; Dt. 31:11; Is. 1:12). Also את־פני, the object of the verb, points to the active voice of ראה, rather than the passive which Μ has. The changes from Qal to Niph'al were made in these cases because of the objection to the anthropomorphic expression of 'seeing the face of God'. LXX has the passive in all of these examples.
