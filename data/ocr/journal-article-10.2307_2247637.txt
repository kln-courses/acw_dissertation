<plain_text><page sequence="1">Die Urtheilsfunction. Eine psychologische und erkenntniskritische Untersuchung. Von WILHELM JERUSALEM. Wien und Leipzig: W. Braumuller, 1895. Pp. 269. THE author starts with a consideration of the meaning and importance, from the psychological, logical, grammatical and philo- sophical points of view, of the question, What is Judgment? With regard to the grammatical reference, that bears chiefly on the relation between thought and language from the logical point of view as expressly explained by Mr Jerusalem, living flexible judgments have to be reduced to a rigid connexion of concepts. The author's view of the philosophical place of the doctrine of judgment is discussed at the beginning and end of the book, and its importance strongly emphasized. But the bulk of the work is devoted to what the writer regards as the psychological view of judgment-his expressed intention is to furnish "a thorough psychological analysis of the cognitive function." In part of this investigation-the part which is distinguished as analytic rather than genetic or biological', the exceedingly close connlexion between Logic and Psychology, and the difficulty of everywhere drawing a sharp line between them comes out very strikingly; for we are given what purports to be an absolutely general account of Judgment-an account, i.e., which will and does apply to every judgment without exception, when rigidly analysed. This analysis is of course psychological, and it appears to me that it is judgments as thus understood that are the subject and centre of Logic. If there is an absolutely general account of judgments, on that, it would seem, Logic must rest, and with that it must begin. Although the author, to judge from some of his statements, is not in harmony with this view, it is apparently involved in his opinion that on a complete and satisfactory answer to the (psychological) question What do we do when we judge ? depends our whole theoretical view of the world, and that whatever is essential to judgment must hold of every content of judgment. Part of this view seems to me true and important-and it is involved in Mill's account of the Import of Propositions, according to which, for a due analysis, there are two questions which have to be answered (1) What do the Terms stand for? (2) What is the relation 1 Meaning by biological the point of view from which the psychology, of judgment has to investigate the significance of the form of judgment in regard to the preservation of the individual and the race.</page><page sequence="2">104 CRITICAL NOTICES. between the Terms? If we so far know what the Terms stand for as to know what the relation between them is, we must also know (as in this book is pointed out) what is the essential constitu- tion of the object of knowledge. Mr Jerusalem holds that in every (categorical) Judgment some content present to the mind is moulded, systematized and articulated, and thus reduced from indetermination and chaos to system and intelligibility. This is accomplished by help of the idea of Force and Manifestation-the Subject standing for a Centre of Force and the Predicate expressing some manifestation of that force. He undertakes a brief historico-critical revilew of the doctrines of other logicians concerning judgments, supports his own by a detailed analytic and genetic discussion, and tests it by a critical and com- parative application to different kinds of judgment or proposition; finally, after discussing the general trustworthiness of judgment, he takes up the philosophical aspect of the question. Passing over the interesting references to Greek and Scholastic doctrines, and a brief account of the modern theories of judgment, it may be noted that current theories are grouped under four heads: (1) Judgment is a belief-here Mill and other English thinkers, and Brentano's ' Idio-genetic' doctrine are criticised. (2) Judgmnent is a synthesis. Under this head Sigwart comes. (3) Judgment is an analysis. Wundt and Erdmann are mentioned as exponents of this view. (4) In Judgment a presented or ideated content receives form and objectification. This of course, as far as it goes, is the author's own view. With regard to what is said about Mill under the first head, it seems to be ignored or forgotten,that he has discussed the Import of Propositions at great length in his Logic, Book i. and elsewhere, and has declared (among other things) that "the object of belief in a proposition when it asserts anything more than the meaning of words is generally...either the co-existence or the sequence of two phenomena." This (and other expressions of his view) seems to bring Mill's doctrine naturally under the head of synthesis. And of this 2nd doctrine it may be observed that at least it gives the true account of the matter from the point of view of audience- hearer or reader; and this suggests the further remark that much controversy as to the import of propositions or judgmenits may be explained by the consideration that it is from different points of view that different theories have been hit upon and elaborated. The author himself observes that the process of apprehending communicated judgments is synthetic (cf ch. 7 of Pt. 4) but he only mentions it cursorily. We may begin with unity and differ- entiate or articulate it-(as the author), or begin with diversity and unify or connect (as Sigwart), or fully recognise the diversity in unity-as in all items of Knowledge that already form part of our "mental furniture." The unity in diversity, or diversity in unity is common to all cases.-The 3rd view is hardly incompatible with the 4th.</page><page sequence="3">W. JERUSALEM: Die Urtheilsfunction. 105 As regards the theory of Judgment affected by Brentano and his school-which Mr Jerusalem, after Hillebrand, calls Idio-genetic our author concludes that the view is based upon tautology. According to this view judgment is an unique and primitive psychical act (hence the name Idio-genetic) incapable of analysis. In every judgment there is one thing or group which is referred to, and which constitutes the Materie of that judgment; the object before the nind in ideating and in judging is the same, in perceiving S P and in juidging S is P, the same identical thing or group is the object of my mental activity -though there is a profound difference between ideating and judging. Judgments or propositions are not formed by puitting two ideas together and a judgment need not be two-inembered. Judging consists merely in the acceptance or rejection (A nerkennung or Verwerfung) of a presented content-thus This plant is a judgment.-Mr Jerusalem allows that in ideating and in judging one object or group is before the mind; and this certainly seems to be indisputable in the case of judgments already accepted (however acquired), and in most cases where a judgment is framed by the speaker himself. He strenuously objects, however, to the doctrine that judgments need not be two- membered. According to him all that we learn from the expositions of Brentano and his school may be summed up in the phrases, An affirmative judgment (= acceptance of an object) is true when its object exists, and An object exists when the judgment which accepts it is true. The acceptance and rejection declared to be the functions of judgment are meaningless unless to accept means to regard as existent, and to reject means to regard as non-existent. Under the 4th head Mr Jerusalem refers to G. Gerber as his source of inspiration, and lays stress upon Gerber's view of the enormous importance of verbal language for the development of Judgment and of Thought generally. He also mentions with approval Mr Bradley's view of judgment, which however seems to me very different from his own, although recognising the forming and objectifying action of judgmenit. On passing to the genetic investigation of judgment, we find important parts assigned to Ideation or Presentation, to Feeling, to Will, and to Speech. Some idea or presentation is a primary condition of judgment, but judgument is not an association of ideas; nor is verbal expression, nor even mere disintegrating of the presented content, sufficient to constitute judgment. It is by systeniatisation and objectification that idea is transformed into judgment. When an idea is presented to us in perception, we are passive and affected; when we think (as in judging) we are active-hence judging includes elements of volition and of passive feeling. It is interest in some presented content that stirs us up to the activity of judging-and this interest may be described as connected with the satisfaction of an intellectual need of activity- a need however which is occasionally satisfied by mere apprehension of an idea. The need would be likely to make itself felt, at early</page><page sequence="4">106 CRITICAL NOTICES. stages of human development, as an urgent demand for light upon some confused and perplexing presentation or idea, and this demand would find in judgment its natural and only satisfaction. Mr Jerusalem regards the seeking for this form as an act of Will, which aims at reducing the ideational content, with a view to practical ends.-For primitive man, when activity or any manifestation was attributed to any thing, the thing was always regarded (as by children) as a living willing creature. This is explained as due to the predominant force of the Will-apperception mass.-This primitive mythological anthropoiiiorphism, generally regarded as a passing phase, is held by Mr Jerusalem to be of extraordinary interest and suggestiveness, and quite impossible to get rid of altogether. The attribution of life and will to things is regarded as a result of man's own individual experience, in which it perpetually happens that movements follow directly on impulse or even seem simultaneous with it. The connexion (according to Mr Jerusalem) is so intimate that impulse and movement are essentially one, impulse being but the beginning of movement, and being in fact matter of consciousness only when the movement has begun. He rejects the view that feelings of innervation precede movement, but holds that muscular sensations actually accompany the idea of intended movement,-and holds that movement in foreign bodies was naturally regarded by primitive inan as the final term of a series the beginning of which had to be sought within the moving thing, and had to be conceived by him as volitional impulse. To this may be added a consideration of man's ' biological' interest in his environment, the importance to him for practical purposes of a knowledge of things, especially moving things-the frequent need of communicating information as to observed movements, and the appropriateness for this of imitation in many cases; such imitation would be a convincing demonstration of the dependence of the movement upon conscious impulse. In such a separation of the moverment and assigning of it, as the result of volitional impulse to the thing moving, we have the schema of judgment, and an intelligible interpretation and systematisation of the whole presented content. By this interpretation of what is perceived into an independent thing with a will of its own, the ideational content is objectified. So far thought might progress without language; but the complete development of the function of judgment, the conception of Quality or Potential Force, the substitution of the idea of centres and manifestations of force for the crude original anthropomorphism, the clear distinction betwen Subject and Predicate in judgment, the conception of classes of things endowed with similar forces-all this, with its enormous influence on the further development of thought and power of apprehending the world, was possible only by means of language. The question as to the origin of speech cannot of course receive a detailed answer, but it seems probable that its origin is to be</page><page sequence="5">W. JERUSALEM: Die Urtheilsfunction. 107 sought in emotional expression, its further development in the need to understand. Emotional outcries would contain some intellectual elements, and would be understood; the emotional element would, with repetition, fall into the background, while the ideational factor would proportionally gain in strength. The earliest words or roots had comprehensive signification, and only in course of time became split up or differentiated into nouns and verbs. Language could become a complete instrument of thought only when the distinction of Subject and Predicate in Judgment became clearly marked. The feeling-element of Interest pervades all judgment, and judgment is in itself pleasant, according to our author. After tracing the origin and development of Judgment, he goes on to consider the different forms of Judgment in what he regards as the evolutional order of their appearance, testing his theory by applying it in turn to Denominative and Impersonal Judgments, to Judgments of Memory and Expectation, to Conceptual, Relational, and Psychical Judgments. He points out that Subject and Predicate in a Proposition are not independent ideas or presentations but closely connected factors of judgment,-the real unit of thought being thus expressed not in a mere name as such, but in a proposition. The analysis however of propositions into b and P seems indispensable for the due development of thought (as re- duction of words to letters is indispensable philologically) and the clear recognition of the function of the Subject in Predication has an important effect in emphasizing and enhancing the independence attributed to objects of Perception. It is also by its means that the idea of potential activity, so valuable in thought, is developed and fixed; and through it again words acquire universality of meaning, makirng it possible for objects to be thought of in groups. And thus the way is prepared for the formation of Concepts or 'Abstract Ideas.' (I should like to remark here that it seems very difficult to draw the line between Concepts and other ideas, and that we think even of individual objects by means of ideas that are more or Jess abstract.) In passing to consider the so-called Impersonal Judgments, it is first of all pointed out that the Predicate as such is always dependent. It is thus incompatible with the nature of the Judgment-function that a judgnient should consist of a Predicate only. But it has been thought that such judgments occur in 'Impersonal' judgments-e.g. It rains. Has this sentence a Sub- ject? If so, what is it?-The author first considers the views of Miklosich, Brentano, Sigwart &amp;c., contending that the doctrine of Brentano and his school (according to whom Impersonal Judgments are to be interpreted as Existential) is full of confusion and contradiction; and he points out that (1) It rains has a different meaning from (2) Rain is, (1) containing an implication of present fact which (2) does not; also that Existential Judgments are never Judgments of Perception-hence that such propositions as It rainrs cannot be Existential Judgments.-Further on, in considering these</page><page sequence="6">108 CRITICAL NOTICES. latter Judgments, the author points out that they are two-membered, and that in them Existence is the Predicate. According to Mr Jerusalem the true force of Impersonal Judg- ments is to be found in this, that they express a whole process, not that something perceived is named. And the emphatic Present of Impersonal Judgments of Perception refers to the spatial environment of the speaker, and it is this environment which is the subject of the assertion. Lotze, Prantl, Bergmann, Schuppe, seem to be of a similar opinion. Thus in Impersonals too, the forming, and articulating function of the judgment-act is operative. A process is therein apprehended as a condition of the environment of the speaker. This environment is at first anthropomorphically regarded as cause of the process. But soon the anthropomorphism disappears, or keeps its place by the substitution of a Divinity as cause, instead of the environment.-I think it might be suggested that the ' It' of such Impersonals as It rains, indicates that while an occurrence is takinig place which we regard as the activity of something, what that something is, is vague, doubtful or indefinite. In Judgments of Expectation the Future is regarded as existing in germ in the Present. In the present inheres the will, the tendency, the inclination to the future manifestation-we ascribe e.g. to an object of present perception a definite tendency, a direction of Will. The verbal expression for this direction of Will is the Future, which in many languages is simply characterised by the verb to will. Ideas of Relation furnish a special class of Concepts and Conceptual Judgments. As Mr Jerusalem remarks, Relative Judg- ments properly so-called (of which Judgments of Quantity and Number are highly important cases) have received a very scanty measure of attention in most logical text-books-though of course the whole primary force and essential distinction of propositions of this kind falls into the background if they are treated as mere examples of S is P. Though e.g. x 4 may be interpreted as meaning It is a property of x that it is equivalent to 4, yet without doubt what is really emphatic in x =4 as ordinarily used is the Relation of Equality between the two miagnitudes. (As has been pointed out by some previous writers, we are in such propositions concerned with two distinct objects or denotations.) Hence it is concluded that the Subject of such a judgment is the relation of Equality between the two magnitudes, and the Predicate is the Existence, the Vorkandensein, of this relation. And since Existence means nothing but potential or actual activity, the real meaning of the proposition is, This Relation of Equality between x and 4 will show itself operafive in all the succeeding operations. This interpretation seems to me somewhat strained. Judgments concerning Psychical phenomiena are said to be at first sight in direct contradiction with the author's theory, since in statemenets like I rejotce, I anb afraid, I am in pain, the Force- centre which stands for Subje'ct is certainly not distinct from, and</page><page sequence="7">W. JERUSALEM: Die Urtheilsfunction. 109 independent of the person judging; it seems, we are told, as though in such cases the Force-centre were not objective, but the very essence of Subjectivity. But this objection is of a very harmless character, and it is easy for the author to show that my 'I' though of course for myself ' subjective ' is from an universal point of view and for other I's ' objective '-those other I's being objective to me, while subjective each to itself. Thus in these cases too the function of judgment is to form and objectify a given content. But though each 'Subject' is able from the universal point of view to regard himself as just a part of the world, there remains the little Unbequemlichkeit-to use Kant's word-about the relation of the Self-cognising to the Self-cognised-and this is not removed by the author's statement that the 'I' and the ' rejoice' in I rejoice, signify only the I-concept and the joy-concept. The author's use of the terms ,ubjective and objective here, seems wanting in clearness. And the relation between the interpretation here put upon Psychical Judgments and the doctrine asserted in ch. 2 of Pt. i. that "absence of substratum" (Substratlosigkeit) is the distinguishing characteristic of psychical phenomena (cf. also what is said further on in this chapter about Psychical Judgments) seems to stand in need of elucidation. The function of Judgment is said to be physically conditioned as regards both Sensation and Volition; and that we interpret the world as we do is due to the constitution of the objective physical world itself as well as to the special character of our psychical life. Further the Categories of Substance and Cause are declared to be implicit in every Judgment, and the idea of Substance coeval with the idea of Subject of Judgment. It is because in Judgment we transfer to our environment the causal connexion which we sub- jectively experience, that we are enabled to foretell and to produce changes of physical occurrence. With regard to the theory of Judgment here set forth, I am inclined to think that present divergence from the anthropomnorphism assumed to start with is considerably greater than the author believes-that though Force, Substance and so on are indeed found on reflection to be ultimately implied in Judgment, yet that this implication is in many instances very far from being obvious, and that what alone is in all cases of judgment both indispensable to any significance whatever, and obvious without a process of reasoning, is unity in diversity. If this view of judgmient is accepted, then every Subject of a proposition, and therefore every object of knowledge, is a unity which has a plurality of attributes. As regards the origin of the ideas of Substance and Cause, the question of real interest and difficulty of course is, How are they given in experience? and Mr Jerusalem's account of the matter does not solve the problem.-There seems great force in his opinion that the form of judgment which is of general use and value must correspond to the physical constitution of things as well as to the mental, though his contention that nothing which appears to us is</page><page sequence="8">110 CRITICAL NOTICES. mere appearance but always some real aspect of the world seems valueless-because if we take the circumstances of the percipient into account as well as of the perceived, the assertion though undoubtedly true is trivial, if what is meant is that in all perception objectively correct knowledge of the matter of perception is obtained, this seems clearly inadmissible. The author feels strongly that neither the physical nor the psychical element in experience can be given up or explained away, and he accepts as most in accordance with observed fact and most satisfactory philosophically the belated doctrine of the direct inter- action of Mind and Matter. He asserts this repeatedly and in set terms, referring to Will and Movement as psychical and physical factors respectively-we start with the Will of which we are conscious in ourselves, and are led to accept a Divine Will as the fons et origo of force where conscious impulse seems lacking, and as providing the unification and source of all phenomena. This final outcome and chief point of Mr Jerusalem's theory is however but barely indicated and very slightly elaborated-Leaving out of account the difficulties of the relation between Mind and Matter, it may be said that the complete failure to meet-indeed perhaps even to recognise-the problem which may be indicated as that of "the One and the Many" marks this as an entirely inadequate theory of the universe. And there seems a serious difficulty about the relation of Will to Mind and Matter, and about the Meaning to be attached to Will; for since it is through the attribution of Will, or as Force-centres, that objectification is induced upon the matter of external perception, and since it is in virtue of this objectification that we recognize Substance and Causality in the physical world, and since our only direct ex- perience of Causality or Will or Force is said to be in ourselves: I suppose the only meaninig that can be given to the denial of any substrate or substance in psychical phenomena is, that the one sole substance is Will, and that that Will is God, in whom (or which) physical and psychical are all conjoined and co-ordinate. On the other hand it has been clearly indicated that Will is regarded as psychical-and again, much of what is said tends to the exaltation of the physical in comparison of the psychical. Mr Jerusalem's chief strenigth seems to lie in his powers of exposition and of psychological observation and imagination; and whatever may be thought of his metaphysical opinions, the interest and value of much of the psychological part of his work, both analytic and genetic, cannot I think, be doubted. The book as a whole is delightful reading, and full of freshness and suggestion. Even some views and statements which seem to me mistaken are probably in part due to keenness of analysis and truth of observa- tion-for instance the distinction of psychological phenomena as substratlos, and the refusal to regard such phenlomena as the subject of judgment in the same way as material phenomena. It is about the account of the relation between Body and</page><page sequence="9">W. JERUSALEM: Die Urtheilsfunction. 111 Mind that the chief faults of the book seem to gather; e.g. the doctrine of the direct interaction of Body and Mind, as deduced from the experienced juxtaposition of impulse and movement: the view that mere events (what does event mean?) cani affect Force- centres: and the distinction drawn between psychical and physical phenomena as regards their relation to apprehension and to judg- ment.-It appears to me that fromi the psychological point of view, judgments of psychical and of physical fact are on just the same footing, and that there is no essential difference between the modes of apprehension in the two cases, except in the case of Pleasure and Pain. In our present stage of development, physical facts are surely, very often at least, matter of intuition-as far as consciousness goes; and if I say, e.g. I am in a great hurry, or I am going to Londorn to-morrow, is not this Subject-I, as immediately referred to, as distinct fromi the Predicate, and as definiite a Force-Centre, as any Subject of a Judgment concerning physical objects? And is not the Substance of physical objects, as distinct from their attributes, an inference?-It may be said that there is no appeal from a man's consciousness of his own states, but perhaps even this is not always true; and if it is, it is equally true (as far as Perception goes) of the perception of physical objects. I have not attempted to consider Part 5, concerning the Validity of Judgment, and ch. 1 and 2 of Part 6, in which are discussed the relation between Psychology and Theory of Knowledge, Critical Idealism, and a work of Avenarius. I have also left untouched various special points of importance. E. E. C. JONES.</page></plain_text>
