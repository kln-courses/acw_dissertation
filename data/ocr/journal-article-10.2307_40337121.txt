<plain_text><page sequence="1">PEIRCE'S GOD OF THEORY AND PRACTICE Charles Peirce, although it is less well known than it might be, was a religious believer. However, because of his weddedness to logic broadly con- ceived, he was not an ordinary sort of believer. Peter Skagestad aptly de- scribes Peirce's situation: Peirce was himself a believer, and he did not think of himself deficient in the love of truth. This deficiency, he indicates in several places, is a historical accident of religion and is inherently alien to its essence. Religion is committed in principle to objective truth, and this committment can be honored only by bowing to experience; hence, religion, like science, can be true to its own essence only by subjecting its doctrines to the test of experience and criticism. (Skagestad, p. 212) In 1 892, at the age of 52, Peirce underwent an experience that gave life to the religious conviction he had inherited from his father. During the 90s he published a number of essays in both the Monist and The Open Court that gave voice to his religious perspective. While these essays articulated a phi- losophy of religion, Peirce was no less interested in the effects of the practice of religion. A 1905 letter draft to William James is revealing on this score: To think of the true theist's God is real balm to the heart. It comforts one for one's own shortcomings. I feel better already for writing this page. My misery is alleviated. (MS L224, p. 00077). In 1908 Peirce published his final article, "A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God"; it marked the culmination of his religious thinking. Peirce often described how Immanuel Kant's thinking played a crucial role in the development of his own philosophy. Although there is no evidence Revista Portuguese* de Filosofia, 51 (1995) 167-178</page><page sequence="2">168 Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia that Peirce read Religion within the limits of Reason Alone, it seems that Kant's influence extends, at least indirectly, into Peirce's thinking concern- ing religion. Peirce ultimately considered belief in God in light of both theory and practice, identifying religion itself as a practice. However, Peirce main- tained that there was a continuity between theory and practice and conse- quently did not try to retrieve religion, as did Kant, by locating it beyond the reach of understanding. Richard Trammell gets at the difference in a slightly different way: "There is [for Peirce] no ontological distinction between the phenomenal and the noumenal realms, one realm in which theoretical reason holds sway and the other realm intrinsically alien to theoretical reason" (Trammell, p. 16; seeCP, 5.255, 8.168). Despite this important difference, it is useful to see that Peirce came at his attempt to "marry" science and religion by way of the Kantian problematic. What I want to show in this paper is how Peirce came at the question of God's reality from two directions at one time. In this I follow the lead of Trammell and John E. Smith, each of whom has, in a different way, illus- trated the dual nature of Peirce's approach to God. I also wish to provide a brief sketch of the upshot of this approach, to show what the conception of God that arises from this approach means for Peirce's conception of religious belief. As do Smith and Trammell, I will begin with a look at "A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God". However, I want to interpret Peirce's ne- glected argument in light of the seventh and final of his 1903 lectures on pragmatism at Harvard because it provides a useful framework for interpret- ing the dual directionality that is at work in the argument. Because of the idiosyncratic nature of Peirce's philosophical vocabu- lary, I must begin with a few remarks concerning the "Neglected Argument" before turning to my analysis of it. First, Peirce was seeking to learn about the "reality," not the "existence" of God. The distinction held categorial im- portance for Peirce since existence involves reaction or what he called SecondnessJTo search for God as an existent is to search for another finite being in the world. For Peirce, to exist meant to "react with the other like things in the environment" and "in that sense, it would be fetichism to say that God 'exists'"(CP, 6.495). Reality, however, means only that God, whatever 1 Throughout the paper I will refer to Peirce's three categories: Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness. It is not possible here to provide a full account of the categories, though it may be helpful to readers not familiar with Peirce's work to know that he roughly equated them with quality, fact, and law.</page><page sequence="3">D. R. Anderson - Peirce 's God of Theory and Practice 1 69 His mode of being, is not dependent for His being on the thought of any person or finite community of persons. "I define the real, " Peirce maintained, "as that which holds its characters on such a tenure that it makes not the slightest difference what any man or men may have thought them to be, or ever will have thought them to be..." (CP, 6.495). Peirce also drew an important dis- tinction between "argument" and argumentation": "An Argument is any proc- ess of thought reasonably tending to produce a definite belief. An 'Argumen- tation' is an Argument proceeding upon definitely formulated premisses" (CP, 6.457). This distinction opened the way for Peirce's appeal to abduction or retroduction; abduction, as the first stage of Peirce's three-part theory of in- quiry, leads to belief, but it does not offer deductive, demonstrative proof in the way that some thinkers believe the ontological argument does.2 Smith aptly illustrates that Peirce has in mind to show that full reli- gious belief involves a cooperation of "direct experience and argument" (Smith, p. 491). Trammell, in a similar vein, unfolds Peirce's attempt in the "Ne- glected Argument" to work a reciprocal dependence between instinct and reason as a way to exemplify the dual dimensions of belief required for theory and practice. I only intend here to add another angle of vision to the picture of Peirce's "Neglected Argument" and the resultant conception of religious belief that these two thinkers portray. This angle of vision involves sketching a link between "direct experience" and 'instinct" and then employing this link in connection with Peirce's description of the continuity between perceptual judg- ment and abductive inference. Peirce's argument in the "Neglected Argument" begins with a descrip- tion of "musement," a practice that, rightly done, may lead to an initial belief in God's reality. Peirce described the practice as follows: It begins passively enough with drinking in the impression of some nook in one of the three Universes [of Ideas, Actualities, and Signs]. But impression soon passes into attentive observation, observation into musing, musing into a lively give and take of communion between self and self. (CP, 6.459) Musement is a kind of meditation, but one without a specific telos. Indeed, as Trammell rightly points out, Peirce is careful to show that musement properly pursued is in line with scientific inquiry: "The absence of all 'serious pur- pose' (6.458) save an earnest love of 'truth' (6.457) links musement to the 2 In Peirce's theory of inquiry, abduction or retroduction is the first stage of inquiry in which hypotheses are created and adopted. Deduction then explicates the would be conse- quences of the hypothesis and induction provides an experiential test of these consequences.</page><page sequence="4">/ 70 Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia scientific spirit ..." (Trammell, p. 17). The result of musement is that the muser "will come to be stirred to the depths of his nature by the beauty of the idea [of God's reality] and its august practicality, even to the point of ear- nestly loving and adoring his strictly hypothetical God" (cp, 6.467). Musement's leading to a belief in and adoration of God's reality constitutes what Peirce called the "humble argument," the first of three arguments which, nested together, comprised his full "Argument." The second argument of the nest - the "ne- glected argument proper" - erforms the modest task of assessing the simplic- ity and universality of the humble argument and of identifying it as an instance of instinctive belief (see CP, 6.487). This identification is important to my way of treating Peirce's full neglected argument. Finally, the third argument, which I will call the "scientific argument," showed how the humble argument may also be construed as an instance of an initial stage of inquiry, as an abduction or retroduction. Before turning to the 1 903 lecture to see how it might help us interpret Peirce's full Argument, it will be useful to draw out a few intermediate ele- ments. First, as we see in the description of musement above, the humble argument essentially involves perception or direct experience. Peirce had al- ready suggested this point some years earlier when he said: "No: as to God, open your eyes - and your heart, which is also a perceptive organ - and you see him" (CP, 6.493). Furthermore, Peirce sometimes directly located per- ception in the context of instinct. That is to say, perception, for Peirce, involved perceptual judgments about the world as experienced. These judgments are acritical and not consciously controlled by the perceiver; Peirce sometimes referred to them as "incipient judgments" or "percipua"3 The result is that perceptions lead to a kind of practically, not theoretically, indubitable belief. In Peirce's theory of cognition, instinctive belief was the genus of such acritical, uncontrolled beliefs and it therefore made sense for Peirce to see perceptual judgmehts as producing a species of instinctive belief. This was a point he made explicit in his eighth Lowell lecture of 1903: "Ordinary ideas of percep- tion, which Descartes thought were most horribly confused, have nevertheless something in them that very nearly warrants their truth, if it does not quite so. 'Seeing is believing,' says the man of instinct" (CP, 5.593; see also 5.173). The upshot is that our perception of God in musement is instinctive not only 3 For more on this sense of judgment, see Carl R. Hausman, "In and Out of Peirce's Percepts," Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society, XXVI, 3, 1 990 and Richard Bernstein, "Peirce's Theory of Perception," in Studies in the Philosophy of Charles Sanders Peirce, Second Series, ed., E. C. Moore and R. S. Robin (Amherst: The University of Masachusetts Press, 1964).</page><page sequence="5">D. R. Anderson - Peirce's God of Theory and Practice 171 because of its traits of simplicity and universality, but because it involves perceptual judgment. We are now in a position to see the relevance of the pragmatism lecture. Peirce's intent in the seventh leeture was to show his synechism or theory of continuity at work in his later theory of cognition. The lecture is built around what Peirce calls his "three cotary propositions." He so names them for a reason: "Cos, cotis, is a whetstone. They appear to me to put the edge on the maxim of pragmatism" (CP, 5.180). It is the third of these cotary propositions with which I am directly concerned. However, because it rests in part on the first two, it is necessary to begin with a quick look at these. The first is: "Nihil est in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in sensu" (CP, 5.181). Peirce offers his own interpretation of this empiricist principle. By intellectus Peirce intends "a meaning"; and in sensu he takes "in the sense of in a per- ceptual judgment, the starting point of all critical and controlled thinking" (cp, 5.181). In identifying perceptual judgment as the "starting point" of con- trolled thinking, Peirce does not mean that it is controlled; rather, perceptual judgment provides the material with which critical thinking must work. The importance here for my analysis of the "Neglected Argument" is that, for Peirce, God's meaning cannot be something constructed, but must be the result of a prior perceptual judgment. The second proposition states that "perceptual judgments contain gen- eral elements..." (CP, 5.181). This had been the topic of Peirce's two previ- ous lectures; it clearly stands in opposition to the standard nominalism of the empiricist tradition. What he tried to show is that the reality of generals is brought home to us not through an intellectual analysis of particulars alone, but directly in perception. As he put it in the eontext of his own categorial framework: "Thirdness pours in upon us through every avenue of sense" (CP, 5.1 57) 4 The obvious importance of this for my purposes is that it provides for the possibility of the perception of a God whose reality is not that of an existent. Perception is so commonly understood in nominalistic fashion that Peirce felt compelled to "sharpen" his pragmatism with the assertion of the perception of Thirdness or elements of generality.5 Moreover, insofar as all generals or signs are also, in various degrees, vague in their meaning, the first 4 For an excellent treatment of the role of generality in perceptual judgment,see Hausman's essay. 5 Peirce's pragmatism looks to the consequences that would be generated by a concept's being the case not as a collection of particulars but as a habit or general idea. This makes perception of Thirdness crucial.</page><page sequence="6">1 72 Revista Portuguese! de Filosofia two cotary propositions make room for Peirce's insistence that our perceived conception of God is necessarily vague (CP, 5.505, 6.466). As Vincent Potter points out, for Peirce this vagueness of the idea of God's reality is crucial: Indeed this vagueness acts as a corrective to anthropomorphism by negating the limitations of human experience and classification in the infinite reality. In a word, it is vagueness which allows our notions to be about God. (Potter, p. 249) .Moreover, the vagueness of the conception means that it is open to precision and development; this openness, as I will try to show, underwrites the theo- retical dimension of the belief. We can now turn to the third cotary proposition, the one that gives us a purchase on what is at the heart of the "Neglected Argument": The third cotary proposition is that abductive inference shades into perceptual judgment without any sharp line of demarcation between them; or, in other words, our own first premises, the perceptual judgments, are to be regarded as an extreme case of abductive inferences, from which they differ in being absolutely beyond criticiam. (CP, 5.181) The continuity between the two marks off a boundary area. If we examine any instance from this area, we will find it difficult, Peirce suggests, to tell what its precise nature is. Indeed, it might be more appropriate to say that it has no precise nature, that it partakes of both dimensions of the boundary. This is consistent with Peirce's analogous consideration of geometrical boundaries in "The Logic of Quantity." There Peirce stated that the parts "in the immedi- ate neighborhood" of a boundary between a white surface and a black surface "are half black and half white" (CP, 4.127). Moreover, Peirce illustrates the difficulty of distinguishing perceptual judgments and abductive inferences at the point of continuity, and he presents visual examples such as shaded steps that can be seen as being either ascending or descending and the duck/rabbit picture as phenomena that "are true connecting links between abductions and perceptions" (CP, 5.183). In applying this to the "Neglected Argument," my suggestion is that these symptoms of being in the immediate neighborhood of the boundary be- tween perceptual judgment and abductive inference appear in Peirce's de- scription of the humble argument. The idea of God's reality first appears in musement as the perception of an esthetic ideal in which the muser develops "a deep sense of the adorability of that Idea" (CP, 6.486). This is where the perceptual capacity of the heart, in the tradition of Jonathan Edwards, is ef-</page><page sequence="7">D. R. Anderson - Peirce's God of Theory and Practice 1 73 fective. Peirce warns, however, that the force of this perceptual dimension of the Argument leaves the muser in a precarious situation: "there is a great danger that the investigation will stop at this first stage, owing to the indiffer- ence of the Muser to any further proof of it" (CP, 6.488). If one definitely "sees" a duck, why look for a rabbit? However, Peirce argues, if we look closely or, better, if we reflect, we will notice that this Idea functions as a hypothesis, as the first step in an inquiry that must be pursued in controlled and critical fashion, This "scientific argument" introduces the second moment or dimension of the humble argument. "The student", Peirce argues, "applying to his own trained habits of research the art of logical analysis... compares the process of thought of the Muser upon the Three Universes with certain parts of the work of scientific discovery, and finds that the "Humble Argu- ment" is nothing but an instance of the first stage of all such work, the stage of observing the facts, or variously rearranging them, and of pondering them until, by their reactions with the results of previous scientific experience, there is 'evolved' (as the chemists word it) an explanatory hypothesis" (CP, 6.488). The perceptual dimension thus shades into the abductive or retroductive dimension. Peirce reveals the humble argument as functioning at the boundary between instinctive, perceptual judgment and abductive inference; within the confines of a single developing belief, God's reality begins, then, to work simultaneously in two directions. In one direction it begins to supply an ideal for the conduct of life; in the other, it leads us to pursue its nature as an explanatory hypothesis. Having come to us through instinct and scientific reflection, it now suggests consequences for practice and theory. The upshot of this reading of Peirce's "Neglected Argument" is that, for Peirce, full religious belief is neither merely experiential nor merely theo- retical, but both. As Smith suggests, what is interesting about Peirce's approach "is the finding of a point of contact between the movement of the mind in religious meditation and the creative ingenuity of human thought in the do- main of science" (Smith, p. 497). Through the point of contact- the humble argument's standing in the immediate neighborhood of the boundary between perception and abduction - we acquire a belief that performs two jobs and whose wholeness is born of tension. On the one hand, the instinctive, perceptual dimension of the argument provides a practically indubitable belief by which we may conduct our lives, our belief in a vague, though partially articulable, God, produces habits of conduct, Peirce says, in the way that long acquaintance with "a man of great character may deeply influence one's whole manner of conduct" (CP, 6.502). Moreover, since the belief arises out of the attractiveness and adorability of the idea of God, these habits can be understood to be consistent with worship;</page><page sequence="8">/ 74 Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia they are not driven by fear or a concern for propriety. This initial esthetic and emotive element of the humble argument recovers the livingness of religious belief that Peirce, like many ordinary believers, deemed lost in theological disputations. It also led Peirce to make what others have taken to be a peculiar claim: that musement finally leads one "to the point of earnestly loving and adoring his strictly hypothetical God, and to that of desiring above all things to shape the whole conduct of life and all the springs of action into conform- ity with that hypothesis" (CP, 6.467). The peculiarity here is twofold. The first peculiarity consists in the fact that a hypothesis, which is by nature provisional, can effectively command love and offer guidance to con- duct. This peculiarity is made "un-peculiar" in virtue of the continuity Peirce sees between perceptual judgments and abductive inferences. Not all abduc- tions are indubitable enough to function practically. Indeed, Peirce himself took theoretical abductions generally to be unhelpful in practice: "pure sci- ence has nothing to do with belief construed as "what I am prepared to go on today" (CP, 7.606). However, those abductions that stand at the boundary may so function because their plausibility is enhanced by their instinctiveness. Indeed, in the case of the God hypothesis, Peirce claims, "the Plausibility of the hypothesis reaches an almost unparalleled height among deliberately formed hypotheses" (CP, 6. 488 ) . The second peculiarity to be faced in the claim that we worship a strictly hypothetical God arises from the other direction. If God is perceived, how can any doubt arise concerning the belief such that we would be led to an inquiry involving it? Indeed, what does it mean to attach the adjective "hypothetical" to "God"? The fear that attends this peculiarity in Peirce's conception of reli- gious belief is one shared by fundamentalists in many religious traditions who wish to keep their God-belief within the confines of the particular doctrine with which they have associated it. This fear of inquiring into the nature of God, as hypothesis, Peirce believed, is what led traditional Christian theol- ogy, as he encountered it in the late nineteenth century, to the practice of closing avenues of inquiry by damning those who strayed from doctrinal cor- rectness: "Now the principal business of theologians is to make men feel the enormity of the slightest departure from the metaphysics they assume to be connected with the standard faith" (CP, 6.3). Peirce's response to this charge of peculiarity hinges on his claim that the conception of God's reality that emerges through musement is both general and vague. At one level, of course, it remains theoretically or logically open to us to doubt God's reality even vaguely conceived. He certainly had no interest in closing an avenue of inquiry. However, for Peirce, as he revealed in two well known early essays, "Some Consequences of Four Incapacities"</page><page sequence="9">D. R. Anderson - Peirce's God of Theory and Practice 1 75 and "The Fixation of Belief," inquiry begins not with logically possible doubts but with lived doubts. For him at least such lived doubts concerning God's reality were precluded for the believer who arrived at a vague conception of God's reality by way of musement. Where important, lived doubts do arise for the muser, however, is in the precising of the vague conception of God. This is where the hypothetical nature of the belief becomes useful and, again, "unpeculiar." What God means for us as finite believers and inquirers must be understood in the context of what it is to explain. From Peirce's point of view, the two central issues in need of explanation were the development of the cosmos and the possibility of human knowing. In 1 892 in his essay "Evolutionary Love" Peirce had already begun to work out God's agapastic role in creative evolution. He began to implement his own reconstruction of God's meaning. As Trammell maintains: "While Peirce went to work reinterpreting the meaning of religion in an evolutionary, naturalistic framework, there remained others (probably the overwhelming majority among adherents to organized religion) who were unable to make the transition" (Trammell, p. 14). God's role in Peirce's cosmology suggested a parallel role in connection with his "methodeutic" or theory of inquiry. In the "Neglected Argument" he began to outline this regulative role of the God hypothesis. As he put it in a draft of his "Additament" to the essay: the hypothesis of God's reality is logically not so isolated a conclusion as it may seem. On the contrary, it is connected so with a theory of the nature of thinking that if this be proved so is that. (CP, 6.491) In both of these relations, the God hypothesis is open to development. As David Pfeifer aptly states concerning the relationship to cosmology: Because the ideas of growth and evolution are inseparable from God, and because the power of this ongoing creation is God, we begin to grasp that a discussion of the effects of evolution is really a discussion of the effects of God. Thus, testable consequences of the hypothesis of God are consequences of evolutionary love. (Pfeifer, p. 370)6 This entails an historical dimension for our precising of our conception of God's reality. For example, in the 1 8th century God could not have been understood in 6 For a similar development of the relationship to the theory of inquiry, see Bowman Clarke, "Peirce's Neglected Argument," Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society, 1977, pp. 277-287.</page><page sequence="10">/ 76 Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia light of evolutionary theory and in the 19th century our conception could not have been described in terms of quantum theory. Thus, from a philosophical or scientific perspective, Peirce's God hypothesis defines a developmental theism in which the hypothesis is ongoingly adjusted to meet the changes in our conceptions of nature and cosmology. Insofar as it precludes the stagna- tion of a religious belief, Peirce sees this dimension not as peculiar but as reasonable. "The great advantage of a 'hypothetical' God," as Donna Orange argues, is to keep the believer intellectually honest" (Orange, p. 126). Full religious belief, then, amounts to a belief that incorporates both dimensions of the humble argument: the acritical dimension that arises through perceptual judgment and the fallible dimension that attends its status as hy- pothesis. These two work in reciprocal dependence. Peirce "married" science and religion not by reducing one to the other but by bringing them together as continuous moments in a single Argument for God's reality. He acknowledged that this produced a tension within the belief; however, he believed this tension to be a healthful one. The vague, practical God yielded a faith that allowed for the believer to establish habits to meet the vital demands of the conduct of life. At the same time, the hypothetical God tempered the temptation to precise God's vagueness in dogmatic fashion, and thus provided for the growth of religious belief that, so Peirce believed, was its only reasonable course of salvation in the scientific era. Traditionally, religion's deepest difficulty has been its inability to grow, to keep pace with other cultural changes. "Like a plucked flower", Peirce argued, "its destiny is to wilt and fade. The vital sentiment that gave it birth loses gradually its pristine purity and strength, till some new creed treads it down" (CP, 6.430). Peirce's hope in the "Neglected Argument" was to frame a belief in which the "vital sentiment" remained alive while the details of one's account of God remained open to reconstruction. Peirce's conception of religious belief in which the conception of God's reality is at once a source of practical conduct and theoretical inquiry is not, as he would be the first to admit, the final word. Moreover, he understood the complexity of religious practice and its need for a strong element of tradition- alism; his hope was to provide a dimension of flexibility where none existed. Consequently, at a time when religious belief was being supplanted by positivistic and nominalistic scientisms, he offered a new way of approaching the mar- riage of science and religion that was distinct from the mechanical attempts to merge the contents of religious texts and scientific theories. Moreover, he anticipated the political reactions to religion that surfaced in the twentieth century. Instead of retreating into an intellectual fundamentalism or embrac- ing a liberalist reduction of religion to common sense moralism, he hoped to offer religion, whose instinctive commitment to ideals - to the reality of firsts</page><page sequence="11">D. R. Anderson - Peirce's God of Theory and Practice 1 77 and thirds - as well as to God's reality he cherished, a way of reconstructing itself. The day has come, however, when the man whom religious experience most devoutly moves can recognize the state of the case. While adhering to the essence of religion, and so far as possible to the church, which is all but essential, say, penessential, to it, he will cast aside that religious timidity that is forever prompting the church to recoil from the paths into which the Governor of history is leading the minds of men, a cowardice that has stood through the ages as the landmark and limit of her little faith, and will gladly go forward, sure that truth is not split into two warring doctrines, and that any change that knowledge can work in his faith can only affect its expression, but not the deep mystery expressed. (CP, 6.432) Whereas as Kant precluded war by keeping the potential antagonists at a dis- tance, Peirce precluded it by arguing for their continuity. If his argument for a God of theory and practice is not final, it was nevertheless timely in an impor- tant sense and that is all that his own fallibilistic theory of inquiry could de- mand.

ANDERSON Pennsylvania State University, U.S.A. 12</page><page sequence="12">1 78 Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia Abstract In his "A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God" (1908), Charles Peirce argued for two dimensions of belief in God's reality. On the one side, he maintained that this belief would be useful for guiding the conduct of life; on the other side, he maintained that the belief could function as the first stage in a scientific inquiry. My suggestion in this paper is that we examine the last of Peirce's 1903 lectures on pragmatism at Harvard to see how the possibility of this dual function arises out of his late theory of cognition in which the functional certainty of perception is brought to close quarters with the provisionality of hypotheses. The upshot is that for Peirce a healthful religious belief should internally "marry" science and religion -theory and practice - by allowing provisional and vague conceptions of God to carry on the work of guiding conduct. O Deus de Peirce da teoria e da pratica Resumo No texto « A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God» (1908), Charles Peirce defende que ha duas dimensoes de crenca na realidade de Deus. Afirma, por um lado, que esta crenca poderia ser util para orientar o comportamento (conduct of life); por outro, que ela poderia ser como que o primeiro escalao numa investigacao cientifica. A minha sugestao neste artigo e que, examinamos as ultimas conferencias de Peirce de 1903 sobre o pragmatismo em Harvard para ver como a possibilidade desta dupla funcao surge da sua ultima teoria de conhecimento (cognition) em que a certeza funcional de percepcao e usada para aproximar o aspecto provisorio das hipoteses. A consequencia disso e que para Peirce uma saudavel crenca religiosa deve «juntar» internamente ciencia e religiao - teoria e pratica - permitindo as concepgoes provisorias e vagas de Deus para continuar a tarefa de orientar o comportamento. Le Dieu de Peirce de la theorie et de la pratique Resume Dans ce texte «Un argument neglige pour la realite de Dieu» (1908), Charles Peirce soutient qu'il y a deux dimensions de croyance en la realite de Dieu. II afflrme, d'un cote, que cette croyance pourrait etre utile pour orienter le comportement (conduct of life) et, par ailleurs, qu'elle pourrait etre pour ainsi dire le premier niveau dans une recherche scientifique. Ma suggestion -dans le present article est que nous examinions les dernieres conferences de Peirce en 1903 sur le pragmatisme a Harvard pour voir comment la possibility de cette double fonction surgit de sa derniere theorie de la connaissance dans laquelle la certitude fonctionnelle de perception est utilisee pour aborder l'aspect provisoire des hypotheses. La consequence en est que pour Peirce une saine croyance religieuse doit «unir» intrinsequement science et religion - theorie et pratique - en permettant les conceptions provisoires et vagues de Dieu.</page></plain_text>
