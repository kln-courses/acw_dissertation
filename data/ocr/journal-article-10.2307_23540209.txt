<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARLENE: MODERNITY, MORTALITY, AND THE BIOPIC LUCY FISCHER THE SENSE OF AN ENDING Cinema, once heralded as the art of the 20th century, seems now, as the century clos es... to be a decadent art. Perhaps it is not cinema that has ended but only cinephil ia—the name of the very specific kind of love that cinema inspired. . . born of the conviction that cinema was an art unlike any other: quintessentially modern. —Susan Sontag In a New York Times article written on the heels of centenary celebrations for the cinema, Susan Sontag sounded the death knell for the medium, and for the fanatic love that it once inspired. Drawing upon human/corporeal metaphors, she entitled her piece "The Decay of Cinema," and in an anthropomorphic gesture, she likened the history of the art form to an indi vidual biography. "Cinema's 100 years seem to have the shape of a life cycle," she mused, "an inevitable birth, the steady accumulation of glories and the onset in the last decade of an ignominious, irreversible decline." But if one reads her article carefully, it is clear that Sontag is not so much bemoaning the death of all cinema as the end of a particular filmic mode beloved to her: namely, modernism. She speaks glowingly of the serials of Louis Feuillade (championed by the Surrealists), the work of Dziga Vertov (influenced by Futurism and Constructivism), and the dramas of F. W. Murnau (tied to Expressionism). Furthermore, her essay is illustrated with stills from such modernist "masterpieces" as Napoleon (1927), The 400 Blows (1959), and Persona (1967). Sontag is more disparaging of the "igno minious" contemporary cinema—which she sees not only as relentlessly Biography 23.1 (Winter 2000) © Biographical Research Center</page><page sequence="2">194 Biography 23.1 (Winter 2000) commercial but as "bloated," "manipulative," and "derivative"—a "brazen combinatory or recombinatory art." It is not difficult to read here, in her choice of language, allusions to /wftnodernism—with its highly touted strategies of excess, contrivance, and pastiche. But Sontag regrets not only the passing of modernist cinema, but the loss of respect for the passion it once generated. As she notes, "Cinephilia itself has come under attack, as something quaint, outmoded, snobbish." Again, the implied voices with which she argues are those of the postmodern critics, who challenge art cinema's alleged elitism, and instead valorize culture's connections to the popular. Clearly, Sontag's move here is a regressive one—as she sees the love of cinema inherently tied to its ori gins and history. Hence, Sontag speaks of the cinephile's "vast appetite for seeing and reseeing as much as possible of cinema's glorious past." For her, tradition is, by definition, superior: a remake of Godard's Breathless cannot possibly be as good as its source. Extending the trope of cinema as individ ual life, Sontag decries the recent shift to video by remarking how "No amount of mourning will revive the vanished rituals ... of the darkened theater." "If cinema can be resurrected," she concludes, "it will only be through the birth of a new kind of cine-love." These themes of individual and film history, of birth and death, of love and hate, of mourning and melancholia, circulate in a text that references issues of cinema and modernism—Marlene (1983), Maximilian Schell's experimental "biopic" about the famous movie star Marlene Dietrich. If Sontag sees a trajectory of success and decline in the lineage of the medi um, that chronicle is doubled in the record of Dietrich's life, which begins at the turn of the century, precisely when the movies and the modernist aes thetic are in ascendancy, and ends in the 1990s, the heyday of Sontag's maligned postmodernism. DOCUMENTARY DESIRE Truth value is a distinctive feature of the biopic. —George Custen (60) In the same New York Times elegy, Sontag mentions the thrill audiences experienced in 1895 "when the train pulled into the station." She is, of course, paying homage to the Lumière Brothers' The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station—an early work which she chooses to illustrate in her text, thus granting it particular importance. In so doing, Sontag references the documentary form—the mode that Marlene simultaneously invokes and de constructs. In truth, it is a genre not always linked to cinematic modernism.</page><page sequence="3">Fischer, Marlene 195 Though Sontag cites Dziga Vertov, an artist associated with the nonfiction form, the majority of her references are to dramatic filmmakers: Renoir, Truffaut, Bertolucci. Significantly, along with recording the arrival of trains (or exotic locales and everyday scenes), in a biographical impulse, the early documentary captured the lives of "stars": politicians like William McKinley "at home"; actors like Mary Irwin, John Rice, and Sarah Bernhardt in per formance; or industrialists like M. Lumière at breakfast with his family. In this respect, the documentary forged an early link between cinema and celebrity, one that the biopic later translated into fiction/dramatic form, and one which later still Schell would translate to Dietrich. Clearly, what documentary film promised the spectator was a sense of a luminary's presence—a chance not only to see the dignitary, but to expe rience him or her at a closer range than quotidian circumstances would ever allow. It is precisely this aspiration that Schell's film perversely frustrates, for it is a star biography without a star. Though Dietrich contracted Schell to make the movie, ultimately she refused to appear on-camera in it. What does Dietrich's defiance signify? What might it tell us about the cinema, the "biopic," film modernism, and the female star? BODY DOUBLES Soon, very soon maybe, Marlene Dietrich will slink across the screen again. . . . No, this isn't Buddhist reincarnation come to the entertainment world. . . . It's new com puter technology that soon should be good enough to resurrect the dead. —David Bloom Pursuing Sontag's call for a return to cinema's roots, I will reexamine the work of a classical film theorist in order to investigate these questions. In "The Ontology of the Photographic Image," André Bazin (1918-1958) seeks to comprehend the "essence" of cinema. Assuming a highly modern stance (and again, treating the medium like a human life), he concludes that if cinema were "put under psychoanalysis, the practice of embalming the dead might turn out to be a fundamental factor in [its] creation" (9). While on some level, all biography might be thought to "embalm the dead," or to be "aimed against death," as Bazin imagines, for him the cin ematic image has a special capacity to capture an individual's existence, since it seems to assure the "continued existence of the corporeal body" (9). In her essay "Film and Theater," Sontag herself makes a similar point: "Movies resurrect the beautiful dead" (370).</page><page sequence="4">196 Biography 23.1 (Winter 2000) Among the cinema's infamous death "productions" have been such films of the 1890s as Electrocuting an Elephant and The Execution of Mary Queen of Scots—one a documentary and one a hoax. Even before that, one of Eadweard Muybridge's photographic motion studies depicted a man shooting a chicken that seems to explode before our very eyes. Later on, there would be such experimental texts as Georges Franju's The Blood of the Beasts (1949) about a slaughterhouse, Stan Brakhage's The Act of Seeing with One's Own Eyes (1971) set in a morgue, and Hollis Frampton's Apparatus Sum (1972) concerning an anatomy class, as well as such com mercial obscenities as snuff pornography. Within the spectator's attraction to the cinema would seem to be two competing biographical impulses: one that is morbid and fascinated with death, and another that is vital and enchanted with immortality. Both con join in Bazin's image of the Mummy, simultaneously a repulsive artifact of petrified flesh and a magical icon of self-preservation. For Bazin, like mum mification, cinematic representation has a special relation to reality, be cause unlike painting, sculpture, or the literary record, it is "indexical." As he notes, "The photograph as such and the object in itself share a common being, after the fashion of a fingerprint" (15). Hence, in its Ideal form (minus special effects or computer manipulation), the cinematic image serves an almost scientific function—as "evidence" that what it depicts once existed. Clearly, cinema is capable of suspending the body in a flash of time— a fact that links the medium to what Leo Charney calls the modernist "cult of the momentary" (281). But Bazin saw cinema's techniques as far more sophisticated. "The film is no longer content to preserve the object, en shrouded as it were in an instant," he remarks, "Now, for the first time, the image of things is likewise the image of their duration, change mummified as it were' (14-15, my emphasis). Along with time, cinema also captured movement—an element traditionally associated with life, as stasis is with death (Cavell 11). Obviously, the cinema has slyly scripted into its narratives a catalog of figures and symbols for its powers of revivification—from the corpse com ing to life at its own wake, to the mummy escaping from its tomb. Perhaps, had Bazin lived longer he would have seized upon a more contemporary practice for an analogy to the cinematic process: cryogenics, the act of freez ing live (but dying) individuals in order to thaw them out later, when a cure for their disease is found. Like cryogenics, the cinema stores a static or "frozen" image of a subject that is later "defrosted" through the heat of pro jection. Perhaps this is why the cinema has lately taken on the subject of</page><page sequence="5">Fischer, Marlene 197 cryogenics in such works as Sleeper (1973), Late for Dinner (1991), and Forever Young (1992). Rumor has it that Walt Disney—a man especially identified with the cinema—now lies in a state of cryogenized suspended animation (Baudrillard 154). While Bazin's theory of cinema invoked its magical powers, he realized that no modern viewer consciously accepted its illusion of immortality. Rather, Bazin understood that the body which cinema preserved was in large part the corpus of memory. "No one believes any longer in the onto logical identity of model and image," he notes, "but all are agreed that the image helps us to remember the subject and to preserve him from a second spiritual death"—the self same impulse of "conservation" that motivates the literary biography (10). It is in fact her "second death" (in anticipation of her first) that Marlene Dietrich hires Maximilian Schell to prevent. But having hired him to cre ate a documentary version of the biopic, why does she so stubbornly sub vert his wishes? Why does she refuse to be photographed, and what is inter esting about her recalcitrance? FADING STARS I'm ready for my close-up . . . —Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard On one level we can surmise that Dietrich refused to appear in Marlene because she comprehended and endorsed cinema's "cryogenic" role. (Like Joseph Cornell's Rose Hobart, she wished to remain enshrined in "antique" celluloid.) Contrast this to the news media's proclamation in 1996 that Marilyn Monroe would have turned 70 that year, had she survived. Clearly, such reports were meant to exploit the shock value this revelation would have—fueling our grim fantasies of Monroe's feeble appearance. As a film star from the late 1920s through the 1960s, Dietrich had been photographed in her prime, and made to look exquisite—with the aid of Hollywood lighting, makeup, and costume. This is the image of her that the public knows and adores, and one that can be restored at will. Why should she exchange it for one of an elderly diva? Clearly, like that of the legendary Greta Garbo, her impulse to hide speaks of both narcissism and savvy. It is also a fact that Western culture supports the veiling of aged bod ies, especially those of women. Patricia Mellencamp writes of her shock in perusing the Rodin Museum in Paris and finding a particular exhibit:</page><page sequence="6">198 Biography 23.1 (Winter 2000) From Just a Gigolo (© 1981 United Artists Corporation). Photo courtesy of the Museum of Modern Art Film Stills Archives. Unexpectedly, amidst all this lusty creation, I came upon Celle qui fut la belle Heaulmiire, the famous striking, small statue of an old woman, her shrunken breasts sagging away from her skeletal chest bones, her protruding stomach only folds of wrinkled skin. Her shoulders and neck were deeply bowed, her head and eyes downcast, her mouth and chin collapsed with time into a posture of calm acceptance. . . . She was beautifully old. I was startled by her familiar aging body. (248) Dietrich also understands the inherent morbidity of the situation—the public's prurient interest in seeing her deterioration. She must have been keenly aware of the audience's potential for both devotion and deviance— for its tendency to worship stars, yet wish them a tragic denouement. Hence she hoists the cinema on its own petard, demanding to remain frozen in time. What she also counters, however, is cinema's notorious voyeurism—especially as attached to the body of the female star. It is for this reason that for the duration of Marlene we see only archival images of her, whether from such classic fiction films as Destry Rides Again (1939), or from newsreels, documentary interviews, or footage of her stage shows.</page><page sequence="7">Fischer, Marlene 199 Dietrich is of course aware of the particular violence that cinema has done to the mature actress—a phenomenon that has been observed by Edgar Morin. As he notes: "In the American cinema before 1940 the aver age age of female stars was 20-25; their career was shorter than that of male stars, who may ripen ... in order to attain an ideal seductive status" (46 47). The lives of many women performers were dramatically reconfigured in Hollywood's biopics, a third of which concerned female entertainers—for instance, Jean Eagels, Gertrude Lawrence, Helen Morgan, Susan Hayward, and Fannie Brice (Custen 76). But the fate of aging actresses has also been narrativized in fiction form—and quite brutally in the canonical Sunset Boulevard (1950). In that film, Joe Gillis (William Holden), a down-and out screenwriter, happens upon the Gothic mansion of Norma Desmond, an old silent movie queen. In desperate need of work, he agrees to collabo rate with her on a trite and dated screenplay, and finds himself the object of her delusions, rage, and sexual advances. Throughout the film, Desmond is portrayed as repulsive, predatory, and ghoulish. (In fact, when Gillis first arrives she mistakes him for a mortician she has summoned to bury her pet monkey). When Gillis eventually jilts her, she kills him, and is arrested as she hallucinates a "comeback." The film has a strangely "documentary" and "biographical" air to it, as the role of Desmond is played by a fifty-three year-old Gloria Swanson—a major film star in the silent era (and ironical ly, it did produce a comeback for her). Furthermore, two venerable Holly wood directors appear as actors in the film. Cecil B. DeMille, with whom Swanson had worked, plays himself, while Erich von Stroheim plays her butler and former mentor (see Fischer, " Sunset Boulevard')} In a strange fashion, the situation of Schell and Dietrich in Marlene paral- -1. lels that of Gillis and ^ ^¡0 Desmond in Sunset Bou levard—since Schell, a much younger man who was born in 1930, the year The Blue Angel was released, has come to the actress's Paris apartment to assist with her dubious j movie project.

There is also a vaguely seductive aspect to Dietrich's engagement of Schell—with whom she had worked in Judgment at Nuremburg in 1961. Over the course of the film the two have little "lovers' quarrels" over the shape of the narrative and Dietrich's status within it. If one were looking for a complete contrast to Dietrich's refusal of the gaze, it might be found on numerous fronts. One thinks of the American celebrity documentary Truth or Dare (1991) in which Madonna (at her erotic and professional peak) parades before the camera both on-stage and off.2 Nothing is too personal or undignified for her to share with us in this biopic, including a visit from her throat doctor, as lover Warren Beatty looks on. But the contrast between Madonna and Marlene is not just a matter of youth versus age. In the cinema vérité documentary Grey Gardens (1976), an elderly mother and middle-aged daughter—of "interest" largely because they are relatives of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis—agree to be photographed in their decrepit home, and shamelessly preen for the camera. But it is also apparent that the women are mentally unbalanced— and that is, perhaps, the point. Old women, in our culture, would have to be deranged, to agree to become a visual spectacle (see Fischer, Cinemater nity 179—213). Yet in another text, The Wonderful, Horrible World ofLeni Riefenstahl (1993), an eighty-nine-year-old actress/director, in complete command of her senses, happily displays herself to the camera in both scuba diving wet suits and street clothes. In addition to an elderly body, one might imagine that she has a certain "politics" to conceal, but she does nothing of the kind. The key distinction is clearly between those who respond to cinema's call for exhibitionism and those who do not. Yet, despite Dietrich's refusal to be photographed, and her attempts (as Bazin would say) to "preserve" her life through "a representation of life" in the form of her past cinematic treasures, the specter of death re-enters the frame—like the return of the repressed (10). First of all, one has the dis tinct impression that both Dietrich and Schell know that the film is being made because she will soon die (which she did in 1992). In her dubbed nar ration, which perversely reveals, in her raspy, sluggish voice, the very age she has sought to banish from the image, Dietrich jokes about how certain Oscars are "death bed" awards—guiltily granted to their recipients on the eve of their ruin. In this sense, one might imagine Marlene as a "death bed" film. Though this is especially true of the biography of an octogenarian, on</page><page sequence="9">Fischer, Marlene 201 a theoretical level it is the case for all cinema. As Garrett Stewart has noted: "Not only ... are all photographs . . . posthumous but they are ostensibly mortifying; telling of a death that was, they warn of a death coming" (25). Thus, it is all the more ironic that the opening credits announce Marlene as an "Alive" film release. For in fact it seems a "posthumous" document— and here, we might recall that in the film Dinner at Eight (1933), a pro ducer refers to a has-been actor (played by John Barrymore) as a "corpse." Several excerpts in Marlene highlight the theme of mortality. As early as 1931, in an extract from Dishonored, we see her killed before a firing squad. In a clip from Touch of Evil (1958), Dietrich's character tells Orson Welles (as Hank Quinlan) that his future is "all used up." In Destry Rides Again, the refrain of one of her songs is "And when I die. . . ." And a clip from Just a Gigolo (1979), her final film, talks of life going on without her. Beyond such quotations from fiction films, the shadow of death is caught in the documentary segments of the work. At one point, for exam ple, as part of her biographical confessions she speaks of her mother's death, and we see images of a gravestone. When Dietrich describes her own film career, she complains that she has been "photographed to death." Footage of her farewell stage performance in the 1960s reveals a Dietrich who looks already "mummified"—ostensibly through excessive make-up and plastic surgery. And significantly, although in her conversations with Schell, Dietrich refuses to admit a concern with death, and sardonically dismisses conventional notions of an afterlife, it is clear that she knows she has one, albeit in the celluloid versus celestial spheres. As though to invoke self-reflexively the topic of Dietrich's cinematic life and death, Schell interrupts the pulsing "flow" of the film to present a series of still photographs, mostly from Dietrich's childhood—reminders of the inevitable passage of time. Likewise, he uses many freeze frames, a technique that some have seen as especially resonant with mortality. One especially powerful sequence of this kind occurs in a segment of the film that deals literally with death—Dietrich's attendance at the funeral of Gary Cooper. IMITATION OF LIFE Whoever turns biographer commits himself to lies, to concealment, to hypocrisy, to embellishments, and even to dissembling. —Sigmund Freud (qtd. in Custen 148) If Marlene merely presented a conventional star biography, it would not be a noteworthy film; neither would it contribute to discussions of mod ernism. It does so only because, through its self-conscious strategies, it</page><page sequence="10">202 Biography 23.1 (Winter 2000) becomes a virtual treatise on the nature of cinema, the status of documen tary, the dynamics of the star system, the position of the biopic, and the role of cinematic innovation. Schell's willingness to make a film biography of a living woman with out a current appearance of her is interesting both in relation to feminist issues and in regard to the ontology of the medium. For Bazin, the cinema was defined in some sense by a cosmic Lack. On one level this pertained to its photographic production, which through its automatic quality largely dispensed with the human hand. "All the arts are based on the presence of man," Bazin notes; "only photography derives an advantage from his absence" (13). But it is mostly through comparisons between cinema and theater that Bazin surfaces issues of absence. As he writes, "the cinema accommodates every form of reality save one—the physical presence of the actor" (95). In making a biopic without the contemporary image of Dietrich, both the actress and director make a statement about the essence of the medium, which unlike the stage, always denies the spectator com plete access to the performer. Despite the compensatory frenzy of movie fan culture, here Walter Benjamin's thoughts on the loss of aura in the age of mechanical reproduction are highly relevant. But Dietrich's refusal of voyeurism also draws attention to notions of woman's genital Lack—only here, Schell's failure of the gaze associates impotence with Man, and not with his female subject. Yet there are other more intriguing and complex ways in which Schell, through a series of deconstructive techniques, underscores the nature of cinema. Since he has no star to photograph, he makes the production process a significant aspect of the text. As in The Man with the Movie Camera (1928), we repeatedly see the crew working at a film editing table, as images flicker on the Movieola screen. Frequently, they are shots we have already seen projected as part of the film, which lends the text an intricate temporal and narrative scheme. Among the crew, there is an older woman whose identity is not clear. She seems in some respects a stand-in for the elusive Dietrich. Since Schell is not even allowed to film the space of Marlene's apart ment, a request we hear her stridently refuse, he recreates her dwelling, and several moments of Marlene are staged in this ersatz mise-en-scène. But even the authenticity of that reconstruction is called into question when Schell admits that his memory has faded, and that he requires a photograph to refresh it. Obviously, the illusionistic nature of the medium is fore grounded here—the realization that most of what we see in dramatic, and even documentary, films is some order of set.</page><page sequence="11">Fischer, Marlene 203 Behind this modernist trope is, of course, a postmodernist one—a nod to Jean Baudrillard's universe of endless "simulacra" (156—60). Extending this sense of hyperreality is Schell's dizzying use of mirrors in Marlene's fake apartment. Aside from referencing the supposed vanity of Dietrich, they invoke notions of cinema as what Bazin would call "a mirror with a delayed reflection, the tin foil of which retains the image" (97). Also circu lating here is Jean Cocteau's notion of the mirror as tied to the life cycle: if you want to see death at work, he once said, look in the mirror. Signifi cantly, in the clip from Dishonored, Dietrich examines herself in a saber blade before she goes to meet her Maker. Finally, in this equation of death and self-regard, we are reminded of an anecdote told by Sigmund Freud of the uncanny horror he once felt late in life at unexpectedly catching a glimpse of his own aged face in a mirror—a visage he initially failed to rec ognize (156).3 Clearly, this is an experience that Dietrich, plagued by cin ematic mirrors, feels she can do without. Further underscoring the sense of cinema as representation are the var ious reproductions of Dietrich that furnish her counterfeit apartment: a huge framed photograph, a bust. Finally, Schell dissolves boundaries between fact and fiction by interspersing whimsical, staged sequences into his documentary—one a tableau of three Marlene "doubles" in coat and tails; another, a simulation of Marlene being filmed in the silent era. Violating conventional notions of the primacy of the image in cine matic discourse, Schell accomplishes a "substitution trick," and places all his faith in sound and voice—the repository of all biographical utterance in the film. "What's real?" he asks. "The tape recorder," he answers: "We can take that as our reality." As though to signal this, Marlene begins with a black screen and Dietrich speaking. But of course, as Stephen Heath has noted, although voice is often suppressed in the cinema, Dietrich's has been given considerable weight: "the voice is ... a certain deposit of the body, a certain 'grain,' something else again, in excess, which the standards of Holly wood learned to pacify... and in specific instances to exploit (... the voice of a Marlene Dietrich or a Lauren Bacall)" (6). DIETRICH TALKS I then put her into the crucible of my conception, blended her image to correspond to mine, and, pour[ed] lights on her until the alchemy was complete. . . . —Josef von Sternberg (237) Marlene also constitutes a meta-commentary on the relation between the film director and his star—a dynamic that traditionally has had a particular</page><page sequence="12">204 Biography 23.1 (Winter 2000) gender configuration. It is clear from the film's inception that the work inscribes a battle of wills—and sexes—between the male filmmaker and his female subject. Schell wishes Dietrich to appear in the film, and she will not; he urges her to recount anecdotes from her life, and she withholds any incident already published in her autobiography; he wants her to intellec tualize about performance technique, and she mocks his pretensions; he wants to imagine her a "dreamer," and she insists on her crude practicality. In other words, while he wants her to be Galatea to his Pygmalion, rather than allow herself to be configured as the male's exotic "Other" (like the Surrealists' obscure object of desire), Dietrich insists on defining herself— even though we suspect it requires her to lie. One of the more ironic moments of this struggle occurs when Dietrich is impatient with the direc tion the film is taking, and lectures Schell on how it should proceed—that is, starting with her shipboard arrival in America, and moving on to her appearances in such Hollywood films as Morocco (1930). As though to ridicule her trite notions of linear/chronological documentary form, Schell dutifully, but condescendingly, presents to the viewer the very images that she orders, and we all chuckle at their banality. If Bazin attempted to psychoanalyze the film medium, we sense that Schell brings his own "medical gaze" to his female subject, acting on what Mary Ann Doane has demonstrated is a male prerogative. He seems to imagine that, as part of the interview process, he will induce in Dietrich a kind of "talking cure." If for Bazin people's love of the cinema is based on the "need for illusion," Schell intends to divest his cinematic subject of this basic human requirement (11). Unlike Freud's Dora, with whom she shares a certain rebellion, Dietrich unfortunately does not depart, and is indignant when Schell walks out on her. While Schell eventually accepts Dietrich's decision not to be filmed, he resists her refusal to watch her old movies. He sneaks a print of The Scarlet Empress (1934) into her apartment and all but forces her to view it with him. (Earlier, he had confessed that he would try to "trick" her.) Though Dietrich claims she has not seen any of her old films recently—"Me, look at myself? No really!"—it is clear that she knows every frame of them, and instructs Schell to notice particular moments. It is obviously Schell's tri umph. He has bent her will, and perhaps revealed her duplicity. What he has not considered, however, is the ostensible suffering it might bring her to confront her former splendor. Or if he has, he has callously decided that it is well worth the injury. It is Marlene's compassionate assistant who slips Schell a note, quoting the words of Dante, reminding him, "There is no greater pain than the recollection of past happiness in times of misery."</page><page sequence="13">Fischer, Marlene 205 ^1 From The Blue Angel (Der Blaue Engel © 1930 Universum Film A.G.). Photo courtesy of the Museum of Modern Art Film Stills Archives. But beyond thrusting upon Dietrich imposed career reminiscences, Schell attempts to prod her thoughts about her family—acting not only like a biographer and a psychiatrist, but like a detective—searching for the clues to the Marlene-enigma.4 Schell asks Dietrich if she ever missed her father, who died when she was young. She coolly replies, "you can't miss what you never had," but we sense Schell's impatience with her guarded response. Clearly, he wants melodrama and tears, and he gets both when he raises the topic of her mother—which he sees as the key to her conscious ness and to the crime of her dissembling. Though Dietrich has refused all sentimentality throughout the fdm, he finally causes her to break down at its end, when he asks her to recite with him a simple poem that her moth er esteemed, concerning a person begging for forgiveness at a loved one's grave. Finally, Dietrich's arch superiority collapses as she succumbs to a cliche; her harsh, imperial voice cracks and we recognize the sound of muf fled sobs. As Benedict Anderson has written, "nothing connects us affec tively to the dead more than language" (145), and here too we recall that Michel Chion once described the cinema as "a machine made in order to deliver a cry from the female voice" (68, qtd. in Silverman 77). It is pre cisely this that Schell has served up. Dietrich's disintegration also confirms</page><page sequence="14">206 Biography 23.1 (Winter 2000) Custen's view that the "lesson one learns from biopic vicissitudes ... is quite simple: with an unusual gift comes unusual suffering" (75). In Dietrich's momentary and pathetic contemplation of the maternal, the "mummy complex" finally meets the "mommy complex" at the hands of a man young enough to be Dietrich's son. Schell has forced Dietrich to publicly grieve—for her lost youth, fame, beauty, childhood, and family— much as Welles does to his protagonist in Citizen Kane (1941), whose imagery is fleetingly quoted in Marlene. Though the moment of Dietrich's recollection is compelling, we find it vaguely pornographic—and perceive Schell as having moved from a posture of Reverence to Rape. In his bio graphical zeal, he has stripped Dietrich of both personal and cinematic illu sions, leaving her—and us—to confront the aesthetic and psychic void. She of course retaliates later on, when she savagely orders her director to "go back to Mama Schell and learn some manners." THE PAINTER OF MODERN LIFE For Death must be somewhere in a society . . . perhaps in this image which produces Death while trying to preserve life. —Roland Barthes (92) The question, of course, arises as to where Marlene stands in relation to modernist/postmodernist debates. Clearly, Marlene bears traces of the post modern (as is evident from my mention of its ubiquitous simulacra). Beyond this, Dietrich herself often assumes a rather postmodern perspec tive. She derides her status as a sublime screen goddess, and admits that she never especially liked sex. As the viewer watches excerpts of her museum quality films, Schell waxes poetic about them, and urges Dietrich to do the same. Instead, she relentlessly hurls charges against them—of "kitsch" and "kvwatch"—deeming them rubbish, outdated, Camp. Again, we are not entirely sure that she means this, but at least her words pull the rug out from under the precious modernist posture. In a similar vein, when Schell informs Dietrich of the politically-correct readings of her screen persona, she announces that she hates feminists and accuses them of penis envy. Finally, she repeatedly declares herself "bored" with Schell's inquiries, and with the films that he finds so divine. But other aspects of Marlene seem tied to modernist concerns. P. Adams Sitney has discussed the "resistance to vision" that subtends many such texts—a stance that questions the "status and values of seeing." As he notes, "Dramatic moments of vision occur in these works, in which nothing, or</page><page sequence="15">Fischer, Marlene 207 nothing dramatic is seen" (2—3). One could hardly find a better description of the central tension of Marlene, a film which denies the spectator visual substance and pleasure, and subverts the power of cinema as panopticon. Furthermore, the somber and earnest tone of the film seems ultimately to belie Dietrich's parodie cynicism, and links the text to a modernist aes thetic. For the film's deconstructive techniques are never merely playful, but seek such profundities as the Truth of Dietrich's psyche, the Essence of the film medium, and the Key to human existence. If the film's concerns are "post-" anything they are more post-mortem than post-modern— invested in such sober issues as Life and Death. In this regard, it seems interesting that the site of the taping for Marlene is Paris—where Dietrich retired and lived until her passing. For if any locale is identified with the birth of modernism, it is this French city during the late nineteenth centu ry—a metropolis associated with such artists as Charles Baudelaire, Arthur Rimbaud, and Stéphane Mallarmé (Nicholls 1). As Peter Nicholls makes clear, the movement was tied to the theme of mortality: two of the chap ters of his book on the subject are entitled "Decadence and the Art of Death" and "Death and Desire." Similarly, in writing of the modern entertainments that preceded and presaged film spectatorship, Vanessa Schwartz focuses on the Paris morgue and the Musée Grevin—the latter, a wax works specializing in celebrity likenesses (298-311). It is the same solemn modernist contemplation of mortality that informs Marlene, and that links it and its actress-corpse-effi gy-femme fatale to those historic sites of Parisian popular spectacle. If in her essay Susan Sontag calls for a new kind of cine-love to replace cinephilia, Maximilian Schell proposes an old one—necrophilia. But, clearly, despite her alleged archival immortality, it is not only Dietrich who will age and fade, but the very film medium in which she is supposedly preserved. Hence, though long thought to have an advantage over literature, the cinema as a biographical format may bear a certain vul nerability. This issue is raised in the eccentric film Lyrical Nitrate {1991)— a "modernist montage" of silent film fragments that speaks to the biograph ical fate of the medium. One sequence of this text, a virtual treatise on cine matic impermanence and fragility, begins with a shot of a film projection ist, then moves on to some anonymous, turn-of-the-century biblical epic depicting Adam and Eve in the Garden. In the film's return to Genesis and Eden, we also recover cinema's origins and innocence—all to the strains of a female, operatic/maternal voice that would please Kaja Silverman. But in short order the scene becomes troubled, as marks on the emulsion (made from decomposition) obscure the action and view—forcing us to look</page><page sequence="16">208 Biography 23.1 (Winter 2000) "through a glass darkly." Resembling the abstract images of Stan Brakhage's Mothlight (1963)—created from pressed dead insect wings—the celluloid deterioration raises questions of mortality, as the intertitles speak of death and an image of the Grim Reaper appears. Fittingly, in "Falling in Love Again," Dietrich's famous torch song from The Blue Angel, she compares her doomed suitors to moths attracted to a flame. But there is a moment in Marlene in which the filmic material also degenerates. Failing to capture a new image of the reluctant Dietrich, Schell projects an old one on the wall, and in an act of directorial passive-aggres sion, allows the film to combust and melt before our eyes, id ere, the disin tegrating celluloid is vaguely reminiscent of the portrait photographs that burn on a hot plate in Hollis Frampton's nostalgia (1971)—a work whose title could not more aptly echo the bittersweet biographical themes of Marlene. But while Marlene may invoke the modernism of the primitive cinema, and of the American avant-garde, it also relates to the post-World War II European "New Wave"—a movement that Catherine Russell sees as characterized by "narrative mortality." As though to pay respect to this cinema, Schell produces an experimental sequence that blatantly alludes to such auteurs as Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini. In fact, Marlene as a whole might be regarded as a loose remake of Persona, a film much prized by Susan Sontag. For like the actress Elizabeth Vogler, who will not speak, Dietrich, a performer, refuses to appear. And like the nurse who tries to uncover Vogler's biographical secrets in her sum mer home, Schell attempts to pierce Dietrich's defenses in her Paris apart ment. Significantly, in Persona the psychoanalytic process is linked to cin ema and death. As part of a montage that signifies a psychic break within the narrative, Bergman displays the camera, burns the celluloid, and splices in silent movie footage of a dancing skeleton. As we have seen, Schell synchronizes his own modernist vignette with Dietrich's angry voice calling him the worst name she can think of—a "film buff"—banishing him to a "film institute," where she sentences him to communing with "old people" and savoring his relics. Here, perhaps the most fetishized actress in the history of cinema charges Schell with film fetishism. She also implicitly derides his love of the kind of "retrospectives" that play at what Sontag deems the art form's "temples"—film clubs and cinémathèques. It is a less celebratory sense of "retrospective" that informs Marlene—where filmography and biography, direction and introspection, image and Imaginary, drama and trauma, hopelessly superimpose. In Dietrich's tone of mockery, however, we are ultimately reminded of the words of Andy Warhol, who expressed his own misgivings about fame, media, and immortality:</page><page sequence="17">Fischer, Marlene 209 At the end of my time, when I die, I don't want to leave any leftovers. And I don't want to be a leftover. I was watching TV this week and I saw a lady go into a ray machine and disappear. That was wonderful, because matter is energy and she just dispersed. That could be a really American invention, the best American invention, to be able to disappear. . . . The worst thing that could happen to you after the end of your time would be to be embalmed and laid up in a pyramid. I'm repulsed when I think about the Egyptians. ... I want my machinery to dis appear. (112—13) With his characteristic wit and brilliance, Warhol brings together the themes of death, celebrity, antiquity, and moder nity. Though he desires an American invention that could make us disappear, he and viz are stuck with one that makes us appear forever—the cinema. Warhol's wish to make his own "machinery" evaporate is perhaps a secret wish to vaporize the quintessential "machine of the visible." It is against this complex notion of constituting a "leftover"—bodily, biograph ically, and artistically—that Dietrich so forcefully rails in Dietrich in tails, from Morocco (© 1930 Marlene.

Just how strong the legacy is of Norma Desmond is apparent from an article about a journalist's encounter with another aging actress—this time, a real one—Mary Tyler Moore. As Jonathan Van Meter noted when he visited the star's home, inscribed over the intercom are the words: "Open the Gates for Miss Desmond" (40). 2. The comparison between Marlene and Truth or Dare was raised to me by Katrin Micklitz, a graduate student in my class at the University of Pittsburgh. 3. Patricia Mellencamp recounts this anecdote in High Anxiety. 4. Marlene's reluctance to discuss her family background is, according to George Custen, typical of the standard "biopic," which minimizes the role of the sub ject's family (149).</page><page sequence="18">210 Biography 23.1 (Winter 2000) WORKS CITED Anderson, Benedict.
