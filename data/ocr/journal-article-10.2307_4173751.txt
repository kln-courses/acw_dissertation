<plain_text><page sequence="1">Milton's Defensive God: A Reappraisal By GARY D. HAMILTON * C-1 . S. Lewis' well-known contention that "A God, theologically speaking, much worse than Milton's would escape criticism if only He had been made sufficiendy awful, mysterious and vague" seems to invite the conclusion that there is little connection between the theology which God the Father advocates in Book III of Paradise Lost and Milton's artistic decisions regarding the presen- tation of God.' Such a conclusion is misleading, however, and only complicates the modem reader's difficult task of appreciating what Milton was trying to accomplish in this much-criticized section of the poem. It is my contention that the best place to begin under- standing Milton's handling of Book III is with the theology it presents, for in the theology we discover the kind of God which Milton's treat- ment was designed to reinforce. The brand of theology in Book III has generally been recognized as Arminian. But more than the mere application of an appropriate label is needed to illuminate the relationship between meaning and method. Milton's creation of a God "not mysterious" is related to the effort to make him "un- Calvinistic," and the way that God speaks has much to do with whom he is speaking against. It is now commonplace to question the wisdom of Milton's decision to allow God to speak on his own behalf; and those critics appear to be in the majority who dislike what they interpret as the defensive * I would like to acknowledge a grant from the General Research Board, Uni- versity of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, which assisted me in my research on this topic. 1 C.

A. J. Waldock, noting how anxious Milton is to prove God does not cause the Fall, claims that " Never to the end of the poem does he succeed in living down this particular worry" and that the poet, in presenting God's arguments, conveys an impres- sion of " nervousness, insecurity and doubt." 4 William Empson, who amusingly labors to prove the traditional God of Christianity " very wicked," discovers Milton's redeeming feature in his struggle " to make his God appear less wicked." " That this searching goes on in Paradise Lost," says Empson, " is the chief source of its fascination and poignancy." 5 Also using the poem to explore Milton's shifting feelings toward God, Arthur Sewell maintains, " Paradise Lost is the poem of a man whose mind is troubled and changing." 6 The efforts to make God appear " less wicked " and the proofs that God does not cause the Fall are elements in the poem which need to be reckoned with. Yet they will be more fully understood if approached not as expressions of Milton's personal problems, but as problems of the times, to which Milton was addressing himself in the limited way that the demands of epic form allowed. I. What many have called the defensive tone of Book III can best be accounted for by the fact that the poem was written at a time when the Arminian-Calvinist controversy, centering on the doctrine of abso- lute predestination, was still very much alive in many circles in England.

The debate over the extent of God's role in determining man's destiny, which became most in- tense in England in the I650's, had been growing ever since the Dutch theologian Arminius, at the turn of the century, challenged the Calvinist position and declared that it did, in fact, make God rather than man the author of sin.7 Milton reflects in God's defense of himself the resdessness of an age that had come to have doubts about the goodness of its Calvinist God. In Book III God is defending himself against Calvinism, that theological system which had so dominated the hearts and minds of Milton's generation. God's defense is not directed against the whole system, of course, but against those aspects which Milton and many others were finding inconsistent with their understanding of God's goodness. The issues involved in the Arminian-Calvinist controversy were complex ones which do not lend themselves to short, easy explana- tions. But beneath the complexity of the arguments, which were to leave even Milton's devils "in wandring mazes lost,' 8 there lay a readily discernible motivating spirit permeating the position of each 7Arminius (The Writings of James Arminius, tr. James Nichols, W. R. Bagnall [Grand Rapids, 1956], I, 229) asserts that if God has denied to man "such a portion of grace as is sufficient and necessary to enable him to avoid sin," then we must conclude "God really sins . . . God is the only sinner." Thomas Pierce, The Christians Rescue from the Grand Error of the Heathen (London, I658), in his collection of tracts discusses and enlarges upon Arminius' charge. Other important treatments of the theological controversy include: Pierre du Moulin, The Anatomy of Arminianisme (London, I62o); William Prynne, Anti-Arminianisme (London, i630); William Twisse, Vindiciae Gratiae, Potestatis ac Providentiae Dei (Amster- dam, I632; I648), and The Riches of God's Love ...

Perhaps what most significantly distinguished the Arminians from the Calvinists was the way in which they worded their description of the nature of God. Instead of a Calvinist God of power the Arminians insisted upon portraying, above all else, a God of love. Their argumentative weapon was John iii: I6, " For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him, shall not perish but have everlasting life." 9 This scriptural passage was a source of embarrassment for the Calvinists and challenged them to call forth their most ingenious exegetical skills. In the first phrase, " For God so loved the world," " world " had to be interpreted as meaning " the elect," for Christ did not die for all men, only the elect, those whom God had chosen from all eternity. Likewise, "whosoever believeth in him shall not perish " had to be taken to mean " whosoever God causes to believe," for saving faith was only given to those whom God had chosen to save. The Calvinist objection to the Arminians was that they undermined the sovereignty of God's grace. Indeed, the cornerstone of the Calvinist doctrine of predestination was the sovereignty of grace. If man could choose whether or not he would accept God's grace, then it was man, not God, who received the glory for aiding in his own salvation. But if salvation was truly a free act of grace, it could not be dependent upon man's will acting independently of that grace. Furthermore, if God was all-powerful, his grace had to be irresistible. The obvious corollary, spelled out clearly by Calvin, but given even more emphasis by his followers, was that God showed forth his glory, that is, his power, by arbitrarily saving some men and damning others.10 He made the decision of who goes where, not on 9Anthony Farindon, ed., Golden Remains of the Ever Memorable Mr. John Hales (London, i688), dedicatory letter, attributes Hales's "good-night" to Calvin to a moving exposition of John iii: I6 by Episcopius.

Frank Patterson (New York, I93i-8), XV, 319-21, indicates the absurdity of Calvinist manipulation of this verse. For a Calvinist interpretation see Twisse, Riches of God's Love, pp. Io8 if.

The long, complicated dissertations on God which seventeenth century Calvinists produced often echo the arguments that Duns Scotus pre- sented against Aquinas' theology when he explained how absurd it was to seek a necessary reason for what was not necessary. Scotus had concluded that " the divine will wills because it wills, and no reason can be given." " For Calvinists, too, God's justice was in- explicable. Calvin himself had said, " If then we cannot determine a reason why he vouchsafes mercy to his own, except it so pleases him, neither shall we have reason for rejecting others, other than his will." 12 The Arminians, however, were not willing to tolerate an apparently unreasonable God. Benjamin Whichcote, countering the idea that God's mysterious ways cannot be understood, sums up their position: "God does not, because of his Omnipotency, deal Arbitrarily with us; but according to Right, and Reason: and what- ever he does, is therefore Accountable; because Reasonable." 13 That the Calvinist theology was the dominant one in England as Milton probably began writing Paradise Lost is most clearly illustrated by the fact that the Commission of Triers and Ejectors, set up by Cromwell in the I650's to examine the orthodoxy of all ministers, refused to allow anyone to preach who would not publicly denounce Arminian views." The official rejection of Arminianism did not, of course, eliminate the problems which many honest men continued to have with the apparently irrational actions of their Calvinist God. Discussing the reasons for his conversion to Arminianism in the mid- I640's, John Goodwin recalls the preachers who taught him "that there are some reprobates, and these not a few neither, towards whom "' Frederick Copleston, A History of Philosophy (Westminster, Md., 1957), II, 53'. 1- Institutes [Bk.

My soul hath once been in the secret of these men: but let it never enter thereinto more." 15 The Calvinist doctrine presented in such vivid terms was bound to create some doubts about God's good- ness. Richard Baxter, who tried to devise a compromise between Calvinism and Arminianism, found it necessary to write a tract called "God's Goodness Vindicated." His first publisher, in I67I, laments to his readers that it is " too well known, how much this amiable Divine Goodness is denied or doubted of. What cavils are raised against it by men of corrupt minds! What secret prejudice lies against it, and how deeply rooted in our depraved nature! Yea, with how fearful suggestions and apprehensions are some godly Christians . . . sometimes perplexed about it! And even such as are grounded and settled in it, are liable to be assaulted, and many sometimes stagger and stumble at it." 16 Baxter himself explains that his purpose was to " help all such persons out of the snare of this dangerous and trouble- some temptation." "Who can love him whom he believeth to be bad, and so unlovely?" asks Baxter.17 In this respect Milton's Book III may not be unlike Baxter's tract. Perhaps Milton also had those " unlovely " aspects of Calvinism very much in mind when he set out to " assert Eternal Providence, and justify the ways of God." IL Those who are embarrassed by the presence of theology in Book III are free to find solace in the suggestion that Milton meant the dialogue between the Father and Son to be read as drama rather than dogma."8 However, it is unlikely that the embarrassment would have been shared by Milton's first readers; they would have been much better able to accept the dialogue for what it often is-a well-organized "1Exposition of the Ninth Chapter to the Romans (London, 1653), p. 265. 1* The Practical Works of the Rev.

Hamilton 93 and carefully planned lesson in theology, aimed at bolstering the Englishman's faith in the goodness of God by showing him how to avoid the pitfalls which the Calvinist theologians were setting in the way of appreciating divine benevolence. While the lesson might understandably be offensive today, Milton no doubt regarded it as a most necessary part of his effort to produce a work which was " doc- trinal and exemplary to a nation." The modem reader may find the manner of Milton's God less puzzling, and thus perhaps less offensive, by imagining him conducting a debate with a high Calvinist God with whom he is sharing a speaker's platform. Having exerted this effort, the reader may even be able to admire the Father's strategy, which is designed to concentrate on divine goodness and, above all, divine reasonableness. The Father's first speech is an elaborate and explicit denial of the charge for which Arminius and his followers had shown the Calvinists liable-that they make God the author of sin. This theological issue had been introduced in an amusing way in Book II, when Milton had Sin indirectly deny the charge by revealing that her author is Satan, out of whose head she sprang. Now in Book III, God, after announcing that man will give in to temptation, very seriously proclaims, I made him just and right Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall. Such I created all th' Ethereal Powers And Spirits, both them who stood and them who fail'd: Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell. (98-IO2) And a few lines later: They therefore as to right belong'd, So were created, nor can justly accuse Thir maker, or thir making, or dtir Fate. (I 1-3) Then after making a traditional distinction between predestination and foreknowledge (ii4-9), which had been denied by the Cal- vinists, Milton, as if to make absolutely sure that his readers grasp the important theological lesson, has God again explain: They trespass, Authors to themselves in all Both what they judge and what they choose; for so I form'd them free, and free they must remain,</page><page sequence="8">94 Milton's Defensive God: A Reappraisal Till they enthrall themselves: I else must change Thir nature, and revoke the high Decree Unchangeable, Eternal, which ordain'd Thir freedom: they themselves ordain'd thir fall. CI(zz-8) A seventeenth century reader coming across these last lines would not fail to notice how Milton was manipulating current theological jargon. One of the arguments usually evoked to refute the Arminian substitution of conditional decrees for absolute decrees was an appeal to God's immutability. Thomas Whitfeld, launching one of the many Calvinist attacks on the Arminian assertion that God wills a man's salvation upon condition that he will believe, explains, That which is absolutely Eternal, hath neither beginning nor end: but the doctrine of the conditional decree fastens an end, and so soon as that takes place, this is expired . . . so that by this means, Election must needs be in time, and not before all time . . . the doctrine of the conditional will and decree, makes these [divine counsels] to be mutable and changeable.'9 For the Calvinists the "high Decree/Unchangeable, Eternal" was the irrevokable decree, proclaimed from all eternity, that some men would be saved and some men would be damned. Whitfeld's master, William Twisse, the interlocutor of the Assembly of Divines and the most frequently cited spokesman for supralapsarian Calvinism in Milton's day, had carefully shown that the Fall itself must be re- garded as ordained by God.20 But Milton's God says "the high Decree/Unchangeable" is that man shall be free, the very point which Twisse and his followers were unable to explain. When God states he " ordain'd/Thir freedom, they themselves ordain'd thir fall," ""A Vindication of the Doctrine of God's Absolute Decree (London, I657), p. 4. 20 The significance of William Twisse's Vindiciae Gratiae, which first appeared in i632, lies in the clear-cut distinction it made between supralapsarian and sublap- sarian Calvinism. Placing the object of God's absolute decree in a "mass not-yet- created," Twisse criticizes Calvinist Pierre du Moulin's attempt to deny God as the author of sin by asserting the object of the decree in a "mass of sinners." This sublapsarian position, according to Twisse, diminished God's glory, was inconsistent, and did not escape the Arminian charge. Denying that reprobation be without the consideration of sin, Twisse nevertheless asserts that the Fall was ordained by God as part of His original plan, which was to culminate in the mercy bestowed on the elect. See Vindiciae Gratiae (I648), Lib. i, par. I, sect. 4, digr. 3-6, pp. 70-96. Supralapsarians are sometimes called high Calvinists and sublapsarians moderate Calvinists. I shall hereafter use the terms interchangeably.</page><page sequence="9">Gary D. Hamilton 95 he is skillfully using customary high Calvinist language to deny high Calvinist conclusions.2' The note on which God ends his first speech is often overlooked by critics predisposed to view Milton's God as a tyrant. The Father concludes by announcing, " Mercy first and last shall brightest shine " (I34). God is again playing with current theological terminology when he explains his reasons for this decision: The first sort by thir own suggestion fell, Self-tempted, self-deprav'd: Man therefore shall find grace, The other none: in Mercy and Justice both, Through Heav'n and Earth, so shall my glory excel. (129-33) These lines, often puzzled over by those who want to reconcile them with treatments of Satan and his followers elsewhere in the poem, will seem less enigmatic when examined against the background of Calvinism. Milton's first readers would immediately have recognized that God is employing an interesting variation on the doctrine of double predestination. To share their recognition we need only to recall that the Calvinist God arbitrarily chose some men to be saved and others to be damned in order to show forth his glory through his mercy and his justice. Milton's God, too, is saying that his glory shall excel " in Mercy and Justice both," but there is nothing arbitrary about the manner in which this glory is to be manifested. He shall show forth his justice by condemning the devils, and he shall show forth his mercy by offering salvation to man. Those who feel that God is still wicked for condemning the poor devils need only com- pare Milton's formula to the Calvinist solution. They should also compare Milton's final line, " But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine," with some of the Calvinist pronouncements that the vast majority of mankind have been damned and the elect are few. The Son's role in his first response to the Father is that of clarifier. His speech should not be labeled " suasive, as if he has to work on God to prevent him from changing his mind and delivering a sterner sentence." 22 The Father's future course of action has already been " Cf. Peter, A Critiquc of Paradise Lost, pp. i I-2, who uses the reference to the " Unchangeable " decrees as evidence that God is prone to " self-exoneration." "2Peter, p. 12.</page><page sequence="10">96 Milton's Defensive God: A Reappraisal firmly declared, and the Son now seeks to spell out the significance of this declaration in the context of other less praiseworthy altema- tives. Focussing on the bleaker options which the Father might have chosen, the Son leads up to a statement which can only be fully understood in the context of the Arminian-Calvinist controversy: " So should thy goodness, and thy greatness both/Be question'd and blasphem'd without defense" (I65-6). For the Arminians God's goodness could not be defended if He were viewed as arbitrarily ex- cluding some men from His grace. For the Calvinists, on the other hand, God's greatness could not be defended if men could thwart His will by refusing the salvation intended for them. In refuting an Arminian objection Twisse leaves no doubt about which of the two attributes he wanted his God to possess: " Yet aske I pray any man of judgment, which is the chiefer attribute of a King, and more glorious of the two, his prerogative or his clemency? Clemency is a very vulgar vertue, but the royall prerogative is peculiar to one." 23 The Son, however, would want Twisse's question answered quite differently, for his words imply the Arminian position that God's goodness constitutes his greatness. God's best defense, according to the Son, is that his " Mercy first and last shall brightest shine." If the Father's first speech removes the barriers which the high Calvinists had thrown in the way of praising God's goodness, his second speech removes the blocks which even the moderate Calvinists had set up. God begins his second speech where his first speech left off, with the subject of mercy. Now, however, he goes on to define more precisely the scope of his mercy. While the sublapsarians did not believe, as the supralapsarians did, that God had ordained the Fall in order that he might fulfill his decree to save the elect, they nevertheless confirmed that God, after the Fall, bestowed his mercy on some men and withheld it from others according to his pleasure. To the poor sinner concerned about his spiritual status, the uncer- tainty as to whether God had predestined him to eternal salvation or damnation could understandably hinder his full appreciation of God's goodness. The Father dispels all anxieties, however, by declaring the Arminian view of general redemption: " man shall not quite be lost, " Twisse, Riches of God's Love, p. I23.</page><page sequence="11">Gary D. Hamilton 97 but sav'd who will" (173). What made this Arminian view so con- troversial was, as we have noted, the suspicion that this proposition shifts the emphasis from God's grace to man's corrupted will as the detennining element in man's salvation. In Of True Religion Milton was to explain that the Arminian is " condemn'd for setting up free will against free grace; but that Imputation he disclaims in all his writings and grounds himself largly upon Scripture only." 24 In the next line of the Father's speech Milton shows his awareness of the possible tendency in his readers toward condemnation, by the kind of word-play he uses to counter their suspicion: " Yet not of will in him, but grace in me/Freely voutsaf't." The stress which the previous phrase, "sav'd who will," had put on man's role is immediately qualified and replaced by emphasis on God's role, carried out in this speech through the repetition of the pronoun " me." " Grace in me " is followed by " Upheld by me," " By me upheld," and " to me owe/ All hiis deliv'rance, and to none but me." The repetition is necessary in order to impress upon the reader that acceptance of the conditional predestination of those who believe is no more a threat to the sov- ereignty of God's grace than is the doctrine of absolute predestination.25 Next come the lines which have confused many who ponder the Arminianism of Book III: " Some I have chosen of peculiar grace/ Elect above the rest; so is my will " (I83-4). First of all, these words must be approached from the rhetorical point of view. Milton's reference to " peculiar grace " serves the same function as the repe- tition of the pronoun " me " in the preceding lines. It disarms the readers who are predisposed against God's Arminianism and informs them that it does not do violence to God's sovereignty. From the theo- logical point of view the lines are consistent with Milton's own position in the Christian Doctrine and thus not inconsistent with his Arminianism, rightly understood. In his theological treatise Milton says that the doctrine of general redemption does not mean that God's will must be confined so that all men must receive grace in equal measure: "That an equal portion of grace should not be extended to all, is attributable to the supreme will alone; that there are none 2 Works, VI, p6g. "Cf. Peter, p. 13, who feels repetition of "me" smacks of self-aggrandizement.</page><page sequence="12">98 Milton's Defensive God: A Reappraisal to whom he does not vouchsafe grace sufficient for their salvation is attributable to his justice." " Motivating this statement is Milton's refusal to impose limits upon God unnecessarily. The Calvinists un- necessarily limited the scope of God's mercy to a few; Milton will not limit God by refusing to permit Him to give special grace to a few. Milton's views correspond in part with those of Baxter, who explains, " And if besides all the mercy that God sheweth to others, he do antecedently and positively elect certain persons, by an absolute decree, to overcome all their resistances of his Spirit ... what is there in this that is injurious to any others? . . . . Is this any detraction from, or diminution of his universal grace? Or rather a higher demon- stration of his goodness? As it is no wrong to man that God maketh angels more holy, immutable and happy." 27 Milton surely would have objected to the reference to " an absolute decree " but would undoubtedly have agreed with the argument that " peculiar grace)" does not detract from or diminish universal grace. Indeed, had Mil- ton's God failed to mention " peculiar grace," he may have neglected "a higher demonstration of his goodness." Appreciation for the goodness of God would not have been under- mined for Milton's first readers by the final part of the Father's second speech, where he delivers the famous line, " Die hee or Justice must" (280). The call for "rigid satisfaction, death for death" was part of a widely held theory of atonement accepted by Arminians and Calvinists alike.28 Although Milton apparently felt no compulsion to abandon this legalism, he does not in Paradise Lost stress the severity of God's justice; God calls for satisfaction after the propo- sition that mercy shall shine brightest has been thoroughly discussed. The main function of God's demand is the dramatic one of providing an opportunity for Christ to respond freely. Besides offering a parallel to the voluntary mission undertaken by Satan, Milton reinforces the Arminianism of Book III by showing that even Christ has the choice 26 Works, XIV, I47-9. Cf. Kelley, PMLA, LII, 79, who makes a rather strained effort to show the Arminianism of lines I83-4. " "Go4d's Goodness Vindicated," Works, VIII, 529. 28 My research confirms the findings of C. A. Patrides, " Milton and the Protestant Theory of Atonement," PMLA, LXIV (1959), 7-13. Goodwin, Redemption Redeemed, p. i8, gives one of the strongest statements of this position when he insists, " the death of Christ is soveraignly necessary."</page><page sequence="13">Gary D. Hamilton 99 of whether or not to carry out God's will. The exaltation of the Son, the dramatic culmination of the previous speeches, is handled so that it reinforces the central theological message of the book. The Son's voluntary response opens with the subject which closed the Father's first speech, " Man shall find grace." The theme of the Son's speech and the Father's answer to it is that the Son will do for man what man cannot do for himself. The appropriate reply for the reader, who hopefully is now purged of doubts about God's goodness acquired through a Calvinist upbringing, is announced in the hymn of praise sung by the Heavenly Choir: " Father of Mercy and Grace, thou didst not doom/So strictly, but much more to pity incline" (401-2). Against the background of this angelic hymn of praise it is hard not to contrast the harsher modem sounds of condemnation-condemna- tion because Milton, by making God into a lawyer who argues his own case, destroys the mystery which modern man living in a scien- tific age so desperately needs. Perhaps the appropriate answer to the modern reader who is disgusted with Milton's presentation of God is that one man's God is another man's Devil. What Milton's first readers needed was not so much a mysterious God as a reasonable God. To an audience concemed with God's arbitrary, apparently irrational distribution of justice and mercy, Milton presents a God who has reasons for what he does. He creates man free so that his obedience will have a meaning; he grants man grace and not the devils because man was not self-tempted; he demands satisfaction for man's disobedience because his justice must be fulfilled; and he will save those who do not scorn his mercy. For Milton, then, the risks of making God do the talking were never so great or so apparent as they have been to Waldock, or to Lewis. This is not to say, however, that Milton would have felt unchallenged by the task of presenting God. For Milton the real artistic challenge was to present a reasonable God who at the same time sounded like a god. His challenge was to find for God a suitable voice, one which had to be as unlike Adam's as it would be unlike Satan's. It had, in short, to be an unanthropomorphic voice, passion- less, impersonal. The extent to which Milton succeeded in finding a</page><page sequence="14">ioo Milton's Defensive God: A Reappraisal suitable voice is a necessary and proper issue for the literary critic to explore. Yet each critic's verdict is bound to reflect what he imagines Milton's purpose to have been. For those who read God's defense as that of a guilty or angry parent, the issue is already settled; hie is too anthropomorphic. But if we can hear in this defense the words of the Divine Teacher, proclaiming truths that needed to be proclaimed, the voice may sound more like the voice of authority which Milton intended it to be.29 University of Maryland 29 Stanley Fish, Surprised by Sin (London, 1967), pp. 77, 65, admirably defends the rightness of God's" pedagogical stance," and recognizes that God's question, " Whose fault? " (96) is part of the method of exposition rather than an emotional outburst. Irene Samuel, PMLA, LXXII, 603, acknowledges the "toneless voice of moral law " set up as a deliberate contrast to Satan's " ringing utterances."</page></plain_text>
