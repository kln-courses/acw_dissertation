<plain_text><page sequence="1">JAMES H. LEHMANN Polemic and Satire in the Poetry of the Maimonidean Controversy IT IS DIFFICULT TO DENY the centrality of the Maimonidean Con troversy to medieval Jewish history.1 It is equally difficult to deny that, in less obvious ways, the Controversy is central to later periods as well. Questions about philosophy and faith, about the literal truth of Aggadah, and about the proper syllabus of religious study, have been foci of debate not only in the thirteenth century but in the post medieval period as well, and later protagonists have often imaginatively identified their positions with those of the earlier protagonists.2 As a consequence, the mode in which the Controversy has lived on has not always encouraged a balanced and comprehensive view of the Contro versy itself.3 It may well be that Jewish scholarship generally is plagued by an inordinate psychic identification with its subject, but in the partic ular case of the Maimonidean Controversy especially, this identification has led to an almost exclusive focus on the ideological components of the pro- and anti-Maimonist positions. Often overlooked, as a result, have been the specifically literary forms in which the Controversy found its expression.4 This essay seeks to identify and elucidate one particular form uti lized in the course of the Controversy. Through a study of the polem ical poetry of Meshullam da Piera, one of the leading anti-Maimonists of the first half of the thirteenth century, I hope to indicate the richness of thought and of expression attained by da Piera. Equally as important, I hope to show that da Piera's polemical poetry can best be appreciated as a form of verse satire and can accordingly be understood in light of many of the conventions typical of the satiric genre. Moreover, insight into the workings of da Piera's satiric form should lead to a revision of PROOFTEXTS Vol. 1 pp. 133-151 0272-9601/81/0012-0133 $01.00 ? 1981 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">134 JAMES H. LEHMANN the traditional view that this very prominent anti-Maimonist defected to the Maimonist camp under the influence of an epistle of Nahmani des. During the early part of the thirteenth century, the characters in the Maimonidean Controversy included the anti-rationalist Tsarfati rabbis of northern France, the rationalists of the Provence, the Kabbal ists in the circle of Nahmanides, and one Shlomo min haHar of Montpe lier, a fervent anti-Maimonist agitating from within the Maimonist stronghold of southern France.5 Da Piera, as the sha ir as-sarfatiyyln6 or poetic champion of the Tsarfati rabbis, took an active role in the Con troversy. He arranged his formidable poetic talents in the service of the anti-Maimonists and in defense of Shlomo min haHar. But the relation ship between Meshullam's art, his life, and his theological views is extremely complex. The importance of da Piera as a poet and as a figure in the Controv ersy has never been doubted. His poems, forty-nine of which have been edited and annotated by Brody,7 have led Schirmann to call him one of the most original of the Jewish-Spanish poets.8 Critics of his work however, have consistently used a straightforward biographical and ideological criticism while neglecting entirely the rhetorical and con ventional devices which the poet uses in his anti-Maimonist verse satire. Although much of his poetry, nature poetry and panegyric, can be analyzed in terms laid down by literary critics such as Yellin and Pagis,9 the polemical poetry has thus far eluded criticism of its form and structure. There are two explanations for this critical blindspot. First, little is known about da Piera, and his works provide the only clues to his life.10 It is not surprising, then, that his works should have been combed for signs of his life. Schirmann believes that da Piera, also known as En Vidas de Gerona, was born in Gerona and lived in Catalonia during the first half of the thirteenth century.11 He was still active during the Mongol conquests of 1258-1260 which he welcomed in his poetry as harbingers of the Messiah.12 But little else is known, and even this much is uncertain.13 Since da Piera is of special interest to historians because of his involvement with the circle of Kabbalist followers of Nahmanides, we might expect critics to focus on the life of da Piera as much as on his art. A second explanation for the absence of literary analysis of da Piera's polemical poetry is, perhaps, more fundamental. It has to do with the essential problem literary criticism has always had with polemic as a form. Simply put, criticism has often found it difficult to disentangle the literary from the ideological in its study of polemic and satire. Before looking at da Piera 's polemical poetry, therefore, it will be</page><page sequence="3">Polemic and Satire in the Poetry of the Maimonidean Controversy 135 helpful to give some attention to this general critical problem and to indicate some current approaches which may enable us to overcome it. Generally, the ideological content of polemic seems to resist literary analysis. Satire itself faces this same critical problem. Thus, Matthew Arnold could say of Pope that he was a "classic of our prose, not of our poetry."14 This view of satire?as strongly held ideas expressed through poetry?persisted until the middle of this century. It allowed earlier critics to praise or condemn the satirist for the views he held or for the delicacy with which he expressed them. It was only from the biographical view of satire that it could be said of Pope that he was a fiendish monkey pouring scalding oil over his enemies.15 This was bio graphical criticism, one might say, at its most extreme. The more recent reaction to this view, on the other hand, has rejected the distinction between poetry and statement. One now talks of the "poetry of statement" and the "fictions of satire."16 Aside from looking at different forms of imagery, at classical allusion and at rhetor ical and metrical constructions, contemporary theorists of satire have employed the model of the satiric persona as a way of understanding the art of satire.17 This persona is by no means identical with the author, but is constructed and manipulated by the author. At times, most notably in the works of Swift, the satiric persona espouses views directly opposed to those of the real author.18 In no case can persona and author be naively identified. Satire is as fictional about its author as it is about its enemies. Satire, through all ages and languages, presents us with a conventional author. Indeed, Alvin Kernan only reminds us of what should be perfectly evident, namely, that "it would be nonsense to argue, as the biographical critic does, that all authors of satire are straightforward, honest, pessimistic, indignant men, who dislike osten tatious rhetoric, come from the country and have simple moral codes."19 Rather, the satirist places his persona in the context of a series of conventional constraints which govern the relation of poet to satiric opponent. Expressing a crucial insight, Kernan notes that a central element of the satiric convention is the persona's claim to innocence and artless ness.20 To claim to have no style, Kernan argues, is itself a trick of style. In point of fact, the claims to blunt, straightforward and unskilled honesty made by the satirist are so patently false as to be outrageous. In practice he is always an extremely clever poetic strategist and manipu lator of language who possesses an almost limitless arsenal of rhetorical devices. In the case of Meshullam da Piera, it is just this pretended artless ness which distinguishes his polemical satire from his other work and</page><page sequence="4">136 JAMES H. LEHMANN offers the key to an understanding of his poetry. This distinction is a signal that we have in da Piera's anti-Maimonidean polemic a remark able instance of the satiric genre. Critics like Schirmann and Brody picture da Piera as a poet shamelessly confident of his superiority and merciless in his scorn of enemies.21 Yet the remarkable and unmistaka ble fact about da Piera is that it is precisely in the polemical work that the poet fails to exhibit the characteristic haughtiness of his other work. In the non-polemical poetry, da Piera is proud and completely in control. He even boasts of his modesty. But in his anti-Maimonist work the poet is transformed into an uncertain, yearning believer, a man of true faith who believes in the Kabbalah, who is devoted childlike to his Kabbalistic mentors, who sides with the common people. He yearns for an immediate, personal relationship with his God. He eschews complex ities which he claims are beyond him. The polemical poet, in short, is a persona, having little if anything, to do with the poet of da Piera's non-polemical work, and perhaps not everything to do with the real Meshullam da Piera. The paradoxical humility and simplicity of the anti-Maimonist polemic may be explicable in terms of Kernan's conventional satiric author. More specifically, the convention of satire to which da Piera's work belongs is Horatian satire. That form of satire is more diffuse than the withering Juvenalian style. The Horatian mode is often good humored, even self-deprecating. The poetic persona avoids extremes of indignation. The satire of Juvenal, on the other hand, is an almost involuntary outpouring of wrath against the hopeless frenzy of a doomed world. Difficile est saturarti non scribere, "It is difficult not to write satire," is Juvenal's famous motto.22 Or as Pope put it, "I nod in Com pany, I wake at Night/Fools rush into my head, and so I write."23 Beside lacking the fury of Juvenal's satire, the Horatian mode also differs in being a conversational mode. It generally elaborates its satire through a number of poetic voices and characters. These characters are developed through a reciprocal process. Each comes to life in opposition to the other. Horatian satire develops through the articulation and modulation of their different values poetically expressed. This con trasts with the univocal Juvenalian satire. Da Piera's satiric poetry is nothing if not conversational. In fact, the extreme difficulty of his polemical work has mostly to do with the ambiguous identities of the voices involved. This ambiguity has led biographical critics to ascribe various changes in position to da Piera. According to Patai, he moved away from the anti-Maimonist camp and later flirted with heresy.24 Schirmann ascribes the change to da Piera's horrified reaction to the burning of Maimonides' books by Dominicans in 1232.25 Brody, too, believes that da Piera withdrew from the con troversy after reading Nahmanides' letter opposing a ban on Maimon</page><page sequence="5">Polemic and Satire in the Poetry of the Maimonidean Controversy 137 ides' works.26 Although Brody was the first to recognize the dialogical nature of da Piera's poems and the first to see that different positions expressed in the poems were not necessarily those of the poet, his views must be modified once we appreciate the satirical form of da Piera's work. Da Piera in fact never withdraws from the controversy. The critical confusion is not unexpected with such a complex poet. The poet's words deceive and conceal, but da Piera gives us fair warning in this poetic riddle: ^*! kV ato"p3 # / oan i??m ] $ ^/ ?-^ tupi (They asked me: O wise one, who is it that doesn't distinguish good from bad, who sings the praises of the high and mighty, while his heart investi gates and weighs the truth. I answered: It is I, my friends, I am the lying poet.)27 The poet lies?but this is much more than the standard notion that the excellence of poetry is its departure from natural reality (meitav hashshir kezavo). Ani hu . . . ani hu is a rabbinic catch phrase for the constancy of God. Ani hu battehilah va'ani hu hassof she'eini mahalif bidevari.28 The poet, too, is a Creator, but an inconstant and deliberately fickle one. His art is one of fictions, and the reader, unlike the ironic metei hador, had best beware. The claim that da Piera's work can be understood at least partly in terms of the conventions of classical satire does not, of course, imply any direct link with that classical tradition. Nor am I considering here da Piera's relation to the Jewish tradition of parody and satire which is said to originate as a literary form in twelfth-century Spain.29 None theless, whatever its source, it seems clear that there is a characteristic formal structure present in da Piera's anti-Maimonist verse-satire. Typically, a poem begins with a statement espousing a rationalist view. This is followed by a questioning of the view in a voice which may be harsh or relatively restrained. The third portion of the poem is the one in which the poet makes his declaration of faith. This humble declara tion is a turn to, and yearning after, the Kabbalists, who are the poet's models of true faith. Da Piera thus invests his satiric meaning in the character of the persona. The central meaning of the satire is that the Maimonists, unlike the character "Meshullam ben Shlomo," are haughty and arrogant, over-confident in their belief in reason. In the tradition of satire, our poet takes on humble garb and gives the mantle of pride to his enemies. Thus, the milder Horatian mode is appropriate</page><page sequence="6">138 JAMES H. LEHMANN because it allows the poet to identify with the common people and oppose the rationalists. Another important reason for choosing the milder mode has to do with da Piera's ambivalent attitude toward Maimonides himself. The fact that Maimonides was universally admired?even if his followers and some of his works were attacked?made Juvenalian satire impos sible. Distinctions needed to be made, and the Juvenalian mode of satire certainly does not lend itself to distinctions. To appreciate this differ ence, one might consider an example of da Piera's satire directed not against Maimonides but against Abraham ibn Ezra. Poem 11 of Brody's edition, "She aluni heshehoveh vehayah," succeeds brilliantly in the space of only seven lines in constructing a rapidly expanding catalogue of sinners-in-hell, with Ibn Ezra chief among them. This truly delightful work is Juvenalian in its pace, in its sharply focused attack, and in its unmistakable sense of frenzied doom. rnnn D^n^n / rrm vr?iju; nyn n.y? in^'DKi / riiu/?^ rna u^.n ^ ? nmoi / nja -pk? ? an rrtinnu; rp?an mpa ino-iyi / ^ Djn-vi rrip onnzr? / ^ a-pa rr?ajri rra? \ maa rram / anso nyn nna "tpkt? . .. nw pu;1?)? / bim) jaj; nwn?

Instead we have the measured, tripartite structure outlined above. The ration alist voice is answered by argument and then transcended in the poet's turn toward the true objects of his faith. At the end of the poem we have a polemical version of the ode form. We have the characteristic turn of the ode, but the turn is inward to the poet's vision. As a result of confronting the rationalists, the satiric persona turns to his mysteries, his mystics, and his God. The formal structure of the Maimonidean poems is related to their central theological concern. Chief among da Piera's polemical concerns</page><page sequence="7">Polemic and Satire in the Poetry of the Maimonidean Controversy 139 is the question of resurrection and future reward. It is with respect to this issue?which was central to this and the earlier phase of the Mai monidean Controversy?that the persona is most clearly elaborated. The poet, identifying with the mass of believers, asks for reassurance that those who believe in resurrection will not be disappointed. He has been killed by the rationalists who doom him to avdan, a permanent destruction. In one poem, the poet expresses these doubts in a series of allusions to the Book of Job. As a Job figure, the poet gains our sym pathy. And opposed to the doubting, distraught poet, stand the Machia vellian rationalists who believe nothing of future resurrection, but who nevertheless are willing to promulgate that doctrine in order to content the masses. The poetic opposition is established between the innocence of the believers and the poet on the one hand, and the cynical calcula tions of the rationalists on the other. Poem 3 of Brody's collection opens with such a statement by the rationalists. In the opening, da Piera skillfully increases the moral dis tance between the manipulating rationalists and the common believers by describing the latter as foolish peta im. The poet identifies with those who yearn for resurrection. The contrast between believers and ration alists is made absolute. The middle portion of the poem is a response to the rationalists. The poet suggests that there may be mystical explanations of the Tal mudic legends, the aggadot. The poet also asserts his belief in the reality of "places of punishment." Interestingly, these assertions are not made in the poet's own name: Amru mekomot yesh lemarshi'e brit / Yivku kemish patam veyitgodadu (3:17) (They say that there are places for those who violate the covenant, where they might wail and cut themselves as they deserve.) This form of vicarious testimony is typical of da Piera's inno cent. Throughout the polemical poetry, claims of this kind invoke the authority of others. Consider some lines from another poem: QVWOO maun a ib ^Dni / wmi) b^v / nww ??? ? 3)3 nmyib) / nrny? ^ / rmam t^pJW vyjb TiK^nsi / nmi p-ron D^tt -^ rnin ^/ uri / (Who can fault one who ascribes definition and substance [to the Divine Presence] if wise men believe in corporeality, and aggadot testify to dimen sion, and verses attest to corporeality? They testify of my King's glorious image. How wondrous are his cheeks. Go up on the mountain and witness holiness and purity, men of Torah, free of all sin. 40:28-31) The poet here describes the presence of God?his virtual tangibility?in the most intimate imagery. Yet this personal testimony is bound up with the testimony of verses, and more significantly, with the testi</page><page sequence="8">140 JAMES H. LEHMANN mony of the hakhme lev and the bene Torah, the pious wise men who are his mentors.30 As this poem progresses, it becomes clear that the poet's vision is decisively dependent on the authority of others, to the point of becoming a vision of the poet's mentors. Indeed, a panegyric to these people follows immediately (40:31-45). The very vision of God becomes a vision of the poet's mentors. The poetic persona yearns for his men tors, as simple unsophisticated believers yearn for their God. The poet is never presented as an omniscient Kabbalist, but only as a questioning believer. He is the satiric innocent. The final portion of Poem 3 turns to a personal declaration by the poet. His heart goes out to those who have given their lives for the sake of true belief. Libbi la'addirim asher shudadu (3:28). In this, as in the other polemical poems, the poet remains self-effacing, paying homage to his mentors with child-like fervor. Da Piera 's satiric technique opposes the cynical, arrogant rationalist to the innocent poet-believer. Unlike the innocent poet, the rationalist considers his reason suffi cient for all things, and so he is an intensely ironic character in the poetry. Da Piera conveys this irony through his use of the ketav motif. Ketav (writing) is associated with the Maimonists throughout. There are countless references to the writings which are the objects of da Piera's satire. These writings deny cardinal beliefs regarding resurrection. Hem katvu avdan (They decreed [wrote] destruction, 3:5). As a result, they have decreed a false death for the believers, condemning them to tragic disappointment. They thereby also deny the True Writing which lies beyond their own false writing. This True Writing, as developed in the polemical poetry, is both the Word of God and the Word of the Poet. Rationalist writing (ketav) is not only false; it is also misleading, unclear, lacking in permanence. De Piera toys with the way translation and transmission corrupt the rationalist writing. The rationalist brags of the permanence of the Maimonist texts: asher bikhtav adonenu mehukkim (engraved in the ketav of our master, 40:2). But the poet puns on the senses of engraving and erasure intimated by mehukkim. In another, poem he announces: Kol ketav yimmahek asher emunah dohek (Let every writing be erased that pushes aside true belief, 24:32). And: Umi yukhal limhok 'avonot nikhtamim (And who can erase the stains of sin? 24:16). Indeed, the words of the simplest animal are more certain than the words of the philosopher: (Why do you need Plato and all the philosophers Who give birth to evil And conceive mischief? We have the word of [Balaam's] ass,</page><page sequence="9">Polemic and Satire in the Poetry of the Maimonidean Controversy 141 True words, Who cares about the books that say It was a vision? 44:37-38 The juxtaposition of Plato and the ass's mouth shows the truth of the miracle. Of course there is a certain lack of decorum in placing the devar aton near the devarim shel emet. But da Piera is never above bringing down the sacred where the aim is to bring down the rationalists too. Here Balaam's donkey brays his reality to the sefarim, rationalist books which futilely deny that he has spoken at all. In analyzing da Piera 's polemic satire I have asked the question, "Who speaks?" The answer I have proposed is that da Piera speaks only through the medium of the satiric discourse. But the question presents an additional problem which requires further study. This is the problem of da Piera's relation to Kabbalah. As an esoteric doctrine, Kabbalah necessarily poses the question, "Who speaks?" If the satiric persona doesn't say what the author means, neither does the Kabbalist writer. I have not determined to what extent the two strands can be separated. Further study in this area would pose the challenging task of devel oping a theory of the public and private levels of discourse which would take both satire and Kabbalah into account. I will, however, illustrate the general thrust of this essay with a reinterpretation of a da Piera poem which suggests how his satire is related, if not to Kabbalah itself, then to another Kabbalist, Nahmani des. This is the most famous of his poems, Poem 49 of Brody's edition. Entitled "In Praise and Defense of the Guide,"31 it is the crucial poem in which Meshullam da Piera supposedly withdraws from the controversy after reading the Epistle of Nahmanides to the Tsarfati rabbis known as "Iggeret hammathilah terem e'eneh ani shogeg."32 The Tsarfati rabbis of northern France had written Nahmanides asking his support in the fight undertaken by Shlomo min haHar of Montpelier against the Mai monidean works. In the Iggeret, Nahmanides declared his refusal to sup port what he must have recognized was a hopeless position in Provence. The letter apologizes for Maimonides and advises the allies of Shlomo min haHar to end their anti-Maimonist agitation. Da Piera's poem, Brody tells us, was written after the poet had read Nahmanides' Epistle.33 In the poem, da Piera writes, "Hineni memutsa ben shtei deot (49:33), the poet is torn between the two sides of the controversy?the two positions of Shlomo min haHar and Maimonides?and so chooses the course of silent withdrawal. The temptations of this reading are strong. To have captured both a real event (the poet's withdrawal) and its historical cause (the Epistle</page><page sequence="10">142 JAMES H. LEHMANN of Nahmanides) is certainly the dream of biographical criticism.34 But several problems with Brody's understanding of the poem present themselves. First, a number of da Piera's other poems also seem to express this same theme of withdrawal.35 Second, "withdrawal" is itself a convention of satire and of the "humble" satiric persona, as has been amply demonstrated in Maynard Mack's recent work, The Garden and the City.36 But the most important, and most compelling indication that this poem, like the others, is the product of the meshorer hameshakker, the lying poet, is the way in which the poem does reflect the Epistle. For this poem is in fact a point-for-point, poetic restatement of the letter. But the restatement is wildly exaggerated in its praise of Maimonides, far beyond what Nahmanides actually said in his letter. A close reading reveals that Poem 49 is nothing less than a burlesque of Nahmanides' Epistle, a satire whose butt is none other than Nahmanides himself. The opening voice?typically for da Piera, the ironic voice of a fervent rationalist?is here given over to Nahmanides. As in da Piera's other polemical poems, the true voice of the poet emerges only at the end of the poem, after the opening voice has been satirically discredited. Nahmanides has been turned into a more avid defender of Maimonides than he was in his letter. Satire deals with caricature, not character. In this poem, Nahmanides is caricatured as a newly converted rationalist. Nahmanides' letter opens with a suitably contrite introduction in which the author declares his unworthiness before the French rabbis. He then argues against the ban which had been issued against those who read the Guide and the Sefer hamada . Why did the rabbis not give proper honor to Maimonides? He came upon a barren scene and pre vented many Jews from straying even further from the true path than they had. The innocent Tsarfatim hardly knew the temptations of phi losophy (339:5). Those who would stray mock the commandments, ki en ta am laaverah ve en reah lamitsvot (339:11). Maimonides, then, had no choice but to write, steeped as he was in the foreign culture. The rabbis have spoken disparagingly of Maimonides (340:9). On the contrary, declares Nahmanides, Maimonides is a God-fearing man who adheres strictly to the law. He restored Torah to Yemen, whose inhabitants show their gratitude by mentioning Maimonides in the Kaddish prayer. Nahmanides' point emerges after this reference to Yemen: A decree like that of the Tsarfatim can only be divisive. Nahmanides would prefer that the rabbis repeal their herem since there is no hope of its being generally observed. In any case says Nahmanides, the problem is only with Montpelier, not with "us" (342:23). A fleeting mention then is made of Shlomo min haHar's insistence on literal interpretation of eschatological midrashim. If the rabbis feel that Montpelier should be denied access to Maimonides' works as a result, let the herem not be applied to all regions indiscriminately. And in</page><page sequence="11">Polemic and Satire in the Poetry of the Maimonidean Controversy 143 any event, should Sefer hamada be included in the ban? It is an essential part of Maimonides' non-Guide writing, all of which is unexceptionable. Nahmanides then turns to a lengthy apology for Maimonides' view of avdan. Nahmanides ingeniously accommodates Maimonides to a rabbinic interpretation. Whatever difficulties there might be in reconciling these views, Nahmanides asserts, aval ben tov lera kef i da ato biker izen vehiker (345:15).37 He also excuses Maimonides' failure to make any mention of the nature of hell (darkhei gehinnom) (345:16). Nahmanides then defends Maimonides' position on the issue of Divine corporeality. He concludes, sof davar hakol nishma ki / 'al zot ha 'emunah umatenu emunah (When all is said and done, our people faithfully uphold this article of our faith, 346:10). Even the Tsarfatim are shown to agree with that Maimonidean view. Nahmanides goes on at great length in defending Maimonides. He asserts God's uncorporeality: "en labore guf udemut vetsurah kelal" (347:8). May the herem be quickly repealed. Perhaps the anger of the Tsarfatim should be directed against those who study the Guide publicly (349:8). Maimonides himself opposed dis semination of his work. Then Nahmanides suggests that the whole matter be left alone. Attention should be turned away from polemic and toward study of the law. Hai Gaon is quoted at length to show that Torah study, not philosophy, is essential. The rabbis are finally called on to admonish Shlomo min haHar to moderate his efforts, lest he call down retribution on his head. Let the whole debate take on the char acter of a Hillel-Shammai controversy in which each side respects the other. Nahmanides has been described as "temporizing" in this letter.38 He certainly seems afraid of rationalist reaction to the herem. Whatever the motive for this letter, it clearly takes a pro-Maimonidean position. Its defense of Maimonides, though, as even this cursory summary indi cates, moves very delicately in dealing with certain topics. Da Piera's poem follows closely the course of this letter in arguing for Maimonides. I want to consider now where these two texts join and where they diverge. Da Piera caricatures Nahmanides' defense of Maimonides by omitting qualifications which Nahmanides attaches to his defense. Moreover, the poem leaves out entirely Nahmanides' very lengthy comments on avdan (the issue of future resurrection) and demut (the issue of corporeality). Thus, da Piera exaggerates Nahmanides' praise of Maimonides and at the same time neglects the detailed and reasoned answers which Nahmanides adduced in support of Maimonides. Da Piera thus has it both ways. He presents Nahmanides as a blindly devoted follower of Maimonides. At the same time, da Piera neglects to mention the defenses of those positions with which he himself most strongly dis</page><page sequence="12">144 JAMES H. LEHMANN agrees, and for which he has strongly attacked Maimonides elsewhere. This "duplicity" on the part of our poet precisely fits his rhetorical strategy. The enthusiastic quality of the Maimonist is burlesqued, and the defenses of Maimonides on avdan and demut are passed over in silence. To mention them would be both to dilute the "irrational" pic ture of the Maimonist, and to threaten da Piera's true position, which remains essentially unchanged. Da Piera's use of Nahmanides soon becomes apparent when we compare the arguments of Poem 49 and the Epistle. In the letter, Nah manides opens with a great show of humility before the French rabbis. In da Piera's poem, the opening consists of a corresponding show of humility; the difference is that the voice bows, indeed grovels, before Maimonides. Thus, Nahmanides' bowing before the rabbis is shown by the sha ir as-sarfatiyyTn to be a bowing before Maimonides: Shiflut ani 'oseh lerov hitnatslut (I humble myself in profuse apology). And line 11 of the poem could be spoken to the rabbis or to Maimonides: 'atah tevoeni mehilah megevir / lo ehyeh miposh'im neenashu (May I be forgiven by the Master / May I not be a punished sinner). In the letter, Nahmanides then states his shock at hearing of the herem. This is inserted in the poem of da Piera at lines 3-4: w??yj rrrn A / rnwl? ^j; (They confess their sin and transgression / in that they said harsh things against the Guide. They said of the Guide: Oh, how wrong you are, How crooked are the ways of your book.) Immediately following the plea for forgiveness (lines 12 ff.) in the poem and following the statement of the herem in the letter, defenses of Maimonides are given. It is interesting to consider how these defenses are restated by da Piera. Da Piera writes that the generation was silent until Maimonides came and revived the people with his words (49:12). This corresponds to Nahmanides' first argument for Maimonides. Note, however, that da Piera's "Nahmanides" does not speak so belittlingly of the communities as does Nahmanides himself; nor does he ever intimate that Maimon ides was "forced" by circumstances to write as he did. As Nahmanides puts it, Maimonides was involuntarily forced to build his literary edifice out of the books of the Greek philosophers (339:16). For da Piera's "Nahmanides," on the other hand, there is no qualification of Mai monides' excellence. The phrase kaiav kemikhtav ha'elohim (49:14) raises all sorts of ironic problems in light of da Piera's use of ketav in his other poems. Strikingly</page><page sequence="13">Polemic and Satire in the Poetry of the Maimonidean Controversy 145 enough, this very phrase is used by Nahmanides in his letter in praise of Maimonides. He challenges the rabbis to find anything wrong with Sefer humada: "mah yomru lesefer humada' vehamikhtav mikhtav. This is a crucial passage. Nahmanides has just dissociated himself from the ban on Maimonides' work. He now not only defends the Sefer humada (of which da Piera generally approves39), but even strongly suggests that the Guide itself is not entirely objectionable. Nahmanides' use of the extra vagant comparison to the word of God {mikhtav ha'elohim) is pounced upon by da Piera who places it at the head of his "Nahmanides"' defense of Maimonides.40 Line 15 of da Piera's poem also is derived from the Epistle and it, too, makes Nahmanides into a more avid defender of Maimonides than the text of the Epistle would indicate. The line reads: meta ame torok haludah heevir / az yats'u de'ot ve'az lutashu (He removed the rot from the rationalizations of Commandments, / Then did these opinions go forth, then were they sharpened). Compare Nahmanides' defense of Maimon ides: describing the state of things before Maimonides came on the scene, he writes that the scoffers would laugh at the believers, "ki en ta am laaverah ve en reah lamitsvah" (339:10-11). Now, the real Nahmani des, I think, has hedged his bets by use of this phrase. His words can be construed as a defense of rationalizing the Commandments, although at the same time, the word ta am is introduced with a studied indirection so as not to compel such a construction. Da Piera's "Nahmanides," however, presents his case much more forcefully. In his case, it is the "rot" of anti-rationalism that blights the lorah, not the foolish, ignorant scoffers, as in the Epistle. Once again, da Piera has emphasized the pro-rationalist character of Nahmanides' defense of Maimonides. This exaggeration of Nahmanides' position can be found also in lines 18-19 of our poem. In the letter to the rabbis of northern France, Nahmanides describes the effect of Maimonides on straying Jews in predominantly indirect terms. The emphasis is on the degree to which Maimonides prevented the deterioration of an otherwise hopeless situation. For da Piera's "Nahmanides," however, the result is more striking: Meyom asher yats'u sefarav 'al pene / Tevel be'ir va'ir yeshivot pashu / Yoshve keranot na'asu meyoshve / Ohel vetahat sofrim nikhbashu (From the day his books appeared on the face / of the earth, academies sprang up in every city, / Ne'er-do-wells became scholars, / Caught in the spell of the learned ones, 18). What was mere apology by Nahmanides, is turned into extravagant hyperbole for da Piera's "Nahmanides" and thereby made absurd. The extravagances of line 21 (in which Maimonides is shown "improving" the holy books which have become mouldy) and lines 23-25 (where his work is compared to those very Divine works) can likewise better be understood in light of the developing satiric plan of</page><page sequence="14">146 JAMES H. LEHMANN da Piera's poem. In each case, a slight exaggeration has been introduced, all qualifications of Maimonides' praise have been omitted, and all mea sured calculation on the part of Nahmanides has been purposely ignored. Nahmanides is to emerge more rationalist than the rationalists themselves. After protesting the evil results of the anti-Maimonidean ban, Nah manides in his letter defends the Mishneh Torah. For good reason, the lavish praise of that Code turns immediately into a detailed justification of Maimonides' discussion of avdan (343:21-345:7). This defense is fol lowed by an equally lengthy assertion of the correctness of Maimoni des' rejection of all forms of divine corporeality (345:30-348:7). Now, there is no mention of either of these two major portions of the letter in da Piera's poem. I have already suggested reasons for da Piera's silence on these issues: Da Piera does not wish to compromise his own posi tions on avdan, as expressed in Poem 3, or on demut, as presented at the end of Poem 40. The silence is all the more striking when we realize how closely "Nahmanides" has thus far been following the course of Nahmanides' letter. By line 31 of the poem, "Nahmanides" new-found rationalism has reached grotesque proportions: Lo 'amdu 'al sod tevunah hoshdim / Moreh umigev mehkar gorashu (Those who were suspicious of the Guide didn't fathom the secret of understanding. / They were expelled from the inner depths of Science). Da Piera's use of the Kabbalistic sod in connection with a defense of Maimonides, as if the Guide represented some Kabbalistic category, in itself brilliantly points the extreme nature of "Nahmanides"' born again rationalism. So, too, where the poet says that he is torn between philosophical and literal versions of rabbinic legends and only tends toward a literal reading of the Aggadah (49:34), this may reflect da Piera's annoyance with the tepid attitude taken by the Epistle (342:27-343:3) with respect to a matter that was vital to Meshullam.41 After da Piera's "withdrawal," he writes: Mi ya'arokh milin velu hayu emet / lm 'al gedolei hazeman niv'ashu (Who can set forth argument even if true, / when the luminaries of the time disapprove? 37). Da Piera's poet can be saying: How can I polemicize when Nah manides disapproves of the angry words of the herem? Or, more specifi cally in the context of the preceding discussion of midrashim, it can be a somewhat sarcastic comment by the poet: How can I speak out in defense of literal interpretation if Nahmanides' letter chooses not to make a big issue of it? Or again, in the ironic voice of "Nahmanides," it might be saying: Why should I speak out at length on this issue when the Tsarfati Rabbis do not want to hear my discussion? (But of course they do, as does da Piera.) "Nahmanides"' silence on this point thus becomes an ironic one.</page><page sequence="15">Polemic and Satire in the Poetry of the Maimonidean Controversy 147 The ending of Poem 49 matches quite closely the conclusion of Nahmanides' letter: Nahmanides quotes Hai Gaon's statement that phi losophy is not the true path to God; those who make such claims for it are in error. But Nahmanides is using this "anti-rationalist" passage as part of an argument against the herem, not for it (349:25 ff.). And this is followed by a request that the Tsarfati rabbis help keep Shlomo min haHar in check. Now the passage of Hai and the preceding lines, "yere' shamayim yashuv veyishkod 'al sefer torah" are clearly the subject of da Piera's lines 38-42.42 Da Piera's "Nahmanides" also suggests that there are, after all, dangers in philosophical study. The poem follows the letter to the end. Nahmanides wants to spread peace all around (350:27-351:10), but da Piera, we know, would fight on if he could. The closing couplet restates the closing praises of the Epistle (351:11-25). Poem and letter end, as they began, together. But da Piera's essentially satiric point has been made well before the closing. I have followed the correspondences of the letter of Nahmanides and the poem of da Piera in order finally to examine the nature of their relationship. At issue is da Piera's intention, but also the "non biographical" approach implicit in the generic notion of satire is called into question by an awareness of the "source" for this poem. Considera tion of the poem's source and genre renders possible an exact appraisal of its nature and demonstrates the inadequacy of the notion that da Piera changed his position or merely restated poetically the position of Nahmanides. I would insist that da Piera is called the sha ir as-sarfatiyyln precisely because he is not merely Nahmanides' poetic mouthpiece. Can we assert then that da Piera broke with Nahmanides on the issue? Not really. First, there are indications that several of the other poems allude?much less directly?to this letter.43 That complicates the basic biographical assumption that only the Epistle "caused" the poem. More generally, however, there is so much artifice here, so much fictional izing of character, that we can hardly be sure when the person of da Piera must enter into the considerations. Add to this the inherent ambi guities of the Kabbalists (da Piera, like Nahmanides) with respect to public statement, and hope of getting back to the "true person" is all the dimmer. It can be asserted, though, that in Poem 49 da Piera's public persona (a redundant term, in fact) satirizes Nahmanides' public stance. As Ben-Sasson suggests, Nahmanides may have meant something other than what he said; da Piera may have known that Nahmanides was temporizing. "Meshullam ben Shlomo," however, speaks in this poem. As is his wont he shows himself to us as an answer to the opening voice of the rationalist. He parodies the entire letter of Nah manides. Meshullam may be more sophisticated in his satiric technique, but the aim is still to elaborate a rhetoric of faith.</page><page sequence="16">148 JAMES H. LEHMANN The poetic method which embodies this rhetoric remains essen tially satiric. A character is caricatured, a point of view is fictionalized, given imaginative coherence. The same process which marks the rest of his polemical work goes on unabated in Poem 49. Because the poem so ably balances the different techniques of satire and parody, and because it includes both methods so intricately into a larger rhetorical plan, it is the most striking of his works. In Poem 5, da Piera writes to a friend: nVT?m b n tj-^j; inrqi / d'ioij nrhy mnjnn in? Tija n^rib ni^o/ur?an Dnnrra ^rmyni .niinrrurn* / w&gt;iy-by_ nyma ; (Prophets have already prophesied of this And written it in proverbs and riddle And I have found in their works Explicit references to things to come. This prophecy is written of us two: I will be the poet, the mystic will be you.) In the final hemistich, the poet declares that his fate has been preor dained: it is poetry; the poet's interlocutor has been fated to be a mys tical Daniel.44 The poet, like Kernan's archetypal satirist, leaves off philosophy and mysticism and modestly assumes the mantle of poetry. We can detect, of course, that this poem is not as modest as the final line would claim. Still, we have come to see that the feigned humility and meekness of our poet-satirist are, in his hands, the most devas tating of rhetorical instruments. His poetic persona consistently yields in order to conquer, and pretends to simplicity in order to emphasize the arrogance of the enemy. And the moment of his "retirement" and "withdrawal" is made into the most radical and effective of his satires. Ani hu / Ani hu hameshorer hameshakker, wrote our lying poet in Poem 41. The divine resonances of Ani hu make this line scandalous. But the line perfectly expresses the poetic method of Meshullam ben Shlomo da Piera: only through the false, changing masks of his satire can the poet remain true.

Silver, Maimonidean Criticism and the Maimonidean Controversy (Leiden, 1965). See also the entry in Encyclopedia Judaica, XI, 746, by Haim Hillel Ben-Sasson. Ben-Sasson has ably summarized the enor mous scope of the cultural and historical themes we call the Maimonidean Controversy: Vast fields of human experience and thought are encompassed by it: reason and philosophy in their relation to faith and tradition; what components are permitted and what prohibited in the education of a man following the Torah; the proper understanding of anthropomorphism as expressed in the Bible and Talmud; central theological concepts such as the resurrection of the body, and the very form of Maimonides'Mis/m?/i Torah and its attitude toward Talmudic discussion. The Controversy can be classified into three periods: the first developed well before Maimonides' death in 1204, and was expressed in works such as Rabad's Critique of Mishneh Torah and R. Moshe Abulafia's Kit?b ar-rasail (ed. Brill, 1871). The second controversy, during which da Piera was active, flared up in the third and fourth decades of the Thirteenth Century. It involved Provence and the Tsarfati rabbis of northern France. The third controversy arose in the early Fourteenth Century with ibn Adret's ban on studying the Guide, and involved Christian Spain as well as Provence. 2 Maimonides' "mighty historical image assumes heroic proportions rather early in his posthumous career, and it is this heroic figure which dominates the stage/' Isadore Twersky, Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (Mishneh Torah) (New Haven, 1980), p. 1. See also Bernard Septimus, "Meir Abulafia and the Maimonidean Controversy" (Disserta tion, Harvard, 1975). It is this heroic image of Maimonides that has led to his appropria tion by various sides of various controversies. One example of this is to be found in the writings of the Me'asfim of the late eighteenth-century Berlin Haskalah. See my "Mai monides, Mendelssohn and the Me'asfim: Philosophy and the Biographical Imagination in the Early Haskalah," Year Book of the Leo Baeck Institute, XX (1975), 87-108. 3 The Maimonidean Controversy has provided a singular and all too fertile ground for stereotypical historiography. This tendency is identified and acutely criticized by Twersky, Introduction, pp. 92-96. 4Twersky's Introduction is itself a very substantial departure from the stereotypical trend in Maimonidean criticism. See his discussion of the formal aspects of Mishneh Torah on pp. 97-187 and 324-56. 5 The pivotal role of Provence in the Controversy and its position as a Maimonist stronghold are described in Twersky, Rabad of Posqui?res, and in Haim Hillel Ben-Sasson and Samuel Ettinger, eds., Jewish Society Through the Ages (New York, 1972). 6 This Judeo-Arabic title appears in the caption to Poem 44 of Brody's edition of da Piera's poems and is taken to mean "a Tsarfati poet."

The editor has provided a translation of selections from his edition including the Epistle (New York, 1978). 33 Brody, p. 114, n. 1. 34 An instance of critics seizing upon this sort of biographical "opportunity" is to be found in the usual treatment of Swift's The Drapiers Utters. See, for example, Herbert David, ed., Jonathan Swift, The Drapiers Utters and Other Works (Oxford, 1941), p. xxxi, or Temple Scott, ed., The Prose Works of Jonathan Swift, D.D. (London, 1903) VI, p. 8. 35 Poems 44, 48 and 49 all contain announcements of the poet's "withdrawal." See 44:90. 24:63 (vehalilah elay lenabbel bimmshalay) also expresses a similar reticence to enter the polemical fray. See also the comments of Gershom Scholem on the ending of Poem 3 in Us Origines de la Kabbale (Paris, 1966), p. 432. 36 Maynard Mack, The Garden and the City: Retirement and Politics in the hater Poems of Pope, 1733-1743 (Toronto, 1969). Mack describes the conventional nature of the satirist's "with drawal," and traces its Horatian roots. Mack's theory is especially plausible in light of Kernan's description of the "retiring" and humble nature of the satiric persona. 37 Note the similarity to da Piera's riddle-poem 41, cited above. 38 Ben-Sasson, Encyclopedia Judaica, XI, p. 750. 39 See 12:17, where Sefer hamada is distinguished from the Guide. 40 Maimonides is said to have written the writing of God (Katav kemikhtav ha'elohim ot be'ot 49:14). It is difficult to believe this is written without irony. 41 Nowhere is da Piera's "rhetoric of pure faith" more meticulously elaborated than in his treatment of non-legal portions of the Talmud. The simple believers are cruelly disappointed by rationalist reinterpretations of aggadic descriptions of the Afterlife. See the opening lines of Poem 48; and see 3:7, p. 13. 42 Compare da Piera: ittf?a -iu7$ mjn mpV? / ni dh nr?rV? Jto^tj Win i?7K ? 3 nrn/iyr. ^- ^ ?vt (Those who learn the law learn enough.

The ending of Poem 24 may refer to Nahmanides, and the "withdrawal" by the poet at 44:83 may just as easily be due to the Epistle. Some literary echoes of the Iggeret are found in 3:16 (cf. 340:5) and 44:82 (cf. 340:16). 44 Js/? hamudot alludes to Daniel 10:11.</page></plain_text>
