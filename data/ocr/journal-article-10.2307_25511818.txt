<plain_text><page sequence="1">Relativity, Quantum Physics, and Consciousness in Virginia Woolf 's To the Lighthouse Paul Tolliver Brown University of South Carolina This essay argues that To the Lighthouse demonstrates Woolf s understanding of the connections between space, time, objectivity, and consciousness and reveals the degree to which her ideas both resemble and diverge from those expressed by Einstein. Whereas Woolf s notions of space and time are intimately linked with the preeminent scientists, her ideas of fluid subject-object boundaries offer a holistic conception of the world that proves far more compatible with the controversial assertions made by quantum physicists such as Bohr and Heisenberg in the early 1900s than with Einsteins adamant belief in objective realism. The author discusses how Mrs. Ramsey embodies key elements of the special and general theories of relativity at the same time as she supersedes them via her conscious connections to people and objects around her. Mrs. Ramsay s unique worldview is counterbalanced by her husband s traditional, representational logic, and dramatized through their interpersonal conflicts. Lily Briscoes artistic development reveals Woolf s own complex beliefs and mirrors the dramatic shifts that occurred in modern scientific epistemologies.

The role of a central narrator increasingly diminished in her novels and was replaced by the internal monologues of?and sometimes internal dialogues between?different characters in relative motion to one another. In addition to noting the commonalities between Woolf 's work and Einstein's, several critics have also proposed that Woolf was aware of and influenced by a num ber of other findings in contemporary science. Ann Banfield asserts that "Planck's discovery of the quantum in 1900, [. . .] Bohr's theory of the atom between 1913 and 1925 [. . . and] the discoveries of de Broglie, Heisenberg, P. Jordan, Dirac and Schrodinger on wave and particle theories in 1925-6 [. . .]" had an impact on Woolf s work and thought (Phantom 6). Sue Sun Yom asserts that her "ideas about writing [. . .] had some tangible relationship to the wave-particle duality and other associated characteristics of light posited in the mid-1920s and 1930s" (145), whereas Michael H. Whitworth contends that "Woolf had developed many aspects of her own wave/particle model [. . .] in anticipation of the physicists" (162). Although these critics have suggested that Woolf's fiction demonstrates an undeniable affinity with Einstein's theories and acknowledge that her philosophy reflects an essential tenet of quantum physics ? specifically the wave-particle dual ity of light and matter?they have yet to establish the specific ways in which the ideas she shared with the preeminent subatomic scientists of her time work into the characters and themes of some of her most important novels. It may be impossible to determine the degree of influence discoveries in contemporary science may have had on Woolf's fiction or in what measure her own ideas preceded them. However, it is certain that, because of her father, she had considerable exposure to the philosophical questions underlying the debates among physicists in the early twentieth century regarding objective reality. Leslie Stephen invested a large portion of his scholarly energies into nineteenth-century realist-idealist debates in which the topics of objectivity and the role of percep tion are paramount. Einstein himself struggled with a belief in objective realism. Problems analogous to those with which Stephen contended resurfaced in a slightly altered form during the scientist's career at around the same time Woolf was writ ing Mrs. Dalloway and To the Lighthouse? Woolf's characters'fluid and oftentimes paranormal connection to one another, and to the objects around them, indicate she does not share all of Einstein's or her father's beliefs regarding objectivity. In To the Lighthouse, however, her concept of space and time remains relative, and she melds Einstein's theories with an additional sense of the permeable boundaries of consciousness between entities that reflects the holistic nature of subatomic phenomena.4 One of the thought problems that Stephen addressed, which informs Einstein's ideological crisis and Woolf's own ideas, involves the existence of unperceived objects. Paradigmatic examples of this thought problem include the following questions: does a table exist when you're not looking at it? If a tree falls in the woods and nobody hears it, does it make a sound? George Berkeley, an idealist, claimed</page><page sequence="3">Relativity, Quantum Physics, and Consciousness in To the Lighthouse 41 that nothing could be said to exist independently of the senses that perceived it, to which Samuel Johnson, a realist, responded, "I refute [Berkeley] thus," and then proceeded to kick a stone (qtd. in Fogelin 79). Of course, Johnson's retort could not disprove Berkeley's claim but was, nevertheless, an argument Einstein would have supported because of its assertion of an objective reality. Isaac Newton resolved the issue between an objective reality existing independently of its observation versus a reality dependent upon its perception by invoking an omnipresent deity. He sur mised that objects existing in space that were not perceived by humans were always under the watchful eye of God, who "endures forever, and is everywhere present [. . . and] perceives and understands all things" (545). Stephen defined objectivity as "outside all consciousness" ("What" 142) and objective truth as "that which is true for both you and me" (149). As the title of his philosophical treatise, An Agnostic s Apology, suggests, how ever, Stephen took the middle road between the realists and idealists without attempting to resolve the dilemma in the way that Newton had done. He concedes to the idealists that "since all knowledge of the outer world comes to us through the senses, we must base every social and other theory upon the knowledge so attained. On such terms, indeed, it is impossible to attain to any knowledge of that supposed transcendental world" ("What" 166). At the same time, he avoids solipsism and radical skepticism by offering a concession to the realists as well, contending that "Any theory which will really affect men's conceptions [. . .] must have its fulcrum on the solid earth, not in dreamland" (Stephen, "What" 164).Though he straddled the fence between realism and idealism, Stephen was expressly against the tenets of materialism, arguing that "Emotions and feelings [. . .] are as real' as stocks [sic] and stones" ("What" 148). According to Stephen, even if "We must appar ently believe that when Shakespeare wrote 'Hamlet,' or Newton the 'Principia,' some corresponding process took place in the little lumps of matter which we call their brains" ("What" 146), directly connecting the substance of the mind with the intangible thought would only lead to the same irresolvable conclusion that each "process [is] a 'sign'of the other" ("What" 146).5 For Stephen, objective existence could neither be proved nor disproved. At the same time, he also believed that human thought and perception were as real as external objects, but bound to an individual consciousness that could not reach beyond itself.6 Einstein dealt with a similar but slightly different formulation of the realist idealist dilemma. He struggled to substantiate his heartfelt belief in an objective reality and further maintained, like Stephen, that the boundaries of consciousness were fixed.7 Unlike Stephen, however, Einstein had to contend with the additional implications of his and others' findings in the field of quantum mechanics. In subatomic science, an observation on a system cannot be made without irrevo cably altering the system in an unpredictable way. For example, bombarding an electron with a beam of light of short enough wavelength to determine its position will unavoidably transfer energy to the electron, knocking it out of position and rendering it impossible to discern its momentum at the moment of observation. By the same token, measuring an electron with a correspondingly weak and long</page><page sequence="4">42 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 3 wavelength of light would enable a physicist to ascertain its momentum, but the increased distance between the crests and troughs of the longer wavelength make it difficult to accurately establish the electron's position. Being unable to determine the simultaneous position and momentum of a particle makes a full description of it in spacetime impossible. Therefore, the minimal conditions for its empirically objective existence are not met. It must be acted upon to be measured, and acting upon it irrevocably and unpredictably changes it. No attempts at less disruptive or more precise measurements are possible, because all objects are composed of subatomic particles. Consequently, an element of ambiguity regarding the notion of objectivity can never be overcome and cannot be attributed to a simple lack of technical innovation.8 In the world of quantum physics, the thought problem of the realist-idealist debate has to be reformulated. In terms of the Berkeley-Johnson example cited above, Johnson would not have been able to locate the stone either before or after he kicked it, so the action of kicking would be inseparable from it, and the independent existence of the stone would be even more difficult to surmise. For the idealists as well, perception must now be understood as a more quasi-creative phenomenon. In the study of subatomic particles, the same experimental set-up will yield unpredictably varied results with repeated trials. Therefore, Stephen's definition of objectivity as "that which is true for both you and me" ("What" 149) is also severely complicated by a multiplicity of "facts."9 Einstein faced a virtual world mediating between an "object" and its perception, which allowed for an array of possible outcomes, none of which could be either validated or invalidated by additional observations.10 Bohr explains: relativity [. . .] by a profound analysis of the problem of observation, was destined to reveal the subjective character of all the concepts of classical physics. In spite of the great demands that it makes upon our power of abstraction, the theory of relativity approaches, in a particularly high degree, the classical ideal of unity and causality in the description of nature [. . .] However, [. . .] the classical ideal cannot be attained in the description of atomic phenomena. (Atomic 1: 97)11 In other words, although perceptions involving measurements of time and dis tance are relative on the macro-physical scale, specific coordinates of location and momentum define an object's identity and connect it via continuous mathematical transformations to all other objects. In the subatomic realm, however, it is logi cally meaningless to purport a fundamental reality that is separable in any sense whatsoever from the action of engagement with it. Either the location or the momentum of an "object" can be discovered at one time, but never at the same time. Therefore, an unambiguously stable identification of a subatomic particle as a classically bounded object or point in space is not possible, nor is it possible to predict its future course through time. In To the Lighthouse, Woolf depicts a relative world but also directly inter rogates the issues of objectivity and realism that interested her father and that Einstein spent the remainder of his career trying to prove. Woolf's exploration of</page><page sequence="5">Relativity, Quantum Physics, and Consciousness in To the Lighthouse 43 the fuzzy boundaries between subjects and objects coincides with the quantum physical understanding of a holistic universe. At the same time, Woolf also seems fascinated with the notion of group consciousness. She worked with many of these concepts in Mrs. Dalloway as well. For example, the relative nature of time is reflected by the contrasting chimes of St. Margaret's and Big Ben, Clarissa feels the sense of being everywhere at once, Septimus experiences unity with inanimate objects such as trees, and many of the other Londoners seem to possess identical thoughts about the motorcar. However, in To the Lighthouse, Woolf brings these ideas to the thematic and philosophical forefront of her work. In the first section of the novel, "The Window," women and their binding power are affiliated with trees as objects that exemplify the interconnectedness of people and places, and a metaphorical conflict between individuality and col lectivity occurs between knives and needles. Mrs. Ramsay acts as a catalyst for Lily Briscoe's obsession with moving a tree to the middle of her painting (Woolf, Lighthouse 86, 93,102); and later, in repose with her husband, Mrs. Ramsay "grew still like a tree which has been tossing and quivering and now, when the breeze falls, settles, leaf by leaf, into quiet" (118). Minta loses her grandmother's brooch, "a weeping willow [. . .] set in pearls" (76), which foreshadows that she will not wind up playing the same traditional female role as her grandmother or Mrs. Ramsay. Unlike Elizabeth in Mrs. Dalloway, the quality of arborescence will not be passed down to Minta.12 Instead, her heritage will be literally and figuratively lost to the upheaval of the coming years, accounted for in the second section of the novel. In the first section, however, Mrs. Ramsay manages to maintain her own traditional position as the force that binds, in spite of her husband who is "lean as a knife, nar row as the blade of one [. . . And who] never altered a disagreeable word to suit the pleasure or convenience of any mortal being" (4). Knives, emblems of separation, are associated exclusively with men. Ironically, even as she acts as a force of connection, Mrs. Ramsay perpetuates this association. She wants to ensure that her son too will inherit the masculine knife as "looking down at the book on her knee [she] found the picture of a pocket knife with six blades which could only be cut out if James was very careful" (16). Although Mr. Ramsay's separateness is an antithetical force to Mrs. Ramsay's connectedness, Mrs. Ramsay loves her husband all the more for the very step-by-step, cause and effect reassurance that his presence confers. Her desire to pass on the heritage of the knife to James stems from her sense that the formal line of her husband's reasoning actually holds together the fabric of tradi tion she so prizes, including the ideas of opposing gender roles and their unity in marriage. Mr. Ramsay's lifelong friend, Mr. Bankes, is also coupled with a knife on several occasions, offering his approval of Lily's work, for example, only after "Taking out a pen-knife [and] tap[ing] the canvas with the bone handle" (52). Nevertheless, the masculine knife finds its counterbalance in Mrs. Ramsay's feminine knitting needles. Mr. Ramsay roams the landscape surrounding the beach house alone, pondering his legacy and separating degrees of knowledge into letters of the alphabet. In the "intensity of his isolation" (36), he eventually seeks the company of his wife to help assuage his doubts and insecurities. She obliges,</page><page sequence="6">44 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 3 "as if all her energies were being fused into force, burning and illuminating" and "flashed her needles" (37). After commenting on Charles Tansley's admiration of him, she feels satisfied with her attempts at amelioration. Graciously, as a queen of her domestic sphere, "Flashing her needles [. . .] she created drawing room and kitchen, set them all aglow; bade him take his ease there" (37). At her will, the ordi nary trappings of a household change into a welcoming refuge, and like Clarissa, Mrs. Ramsay appears to affect space by recreating it on her terms and from her own particularized point of view.13 With her instruments in hand, Mrs. Ramsay knits together objects. Her "flashing needles" offer comfort and togetherness. At the same time, she wields them like weapons against the all-consuming bouts of despair and obsession with the isolated self so often expressed by her needy spouse. Similar to Peter in Mrs. Dalloway, Mr. Ramsay acts as a strong, seductive force in his own right, however, and is not so easily mollified by his wife's confident efforts. Again, he asserts his failure. Mrs. Ramsay responds without a word, but speaks silently nonetheless, imploring her husband to "look then, feel then. Flashing her needles, glancing round about her, out of the window, into the room, at James himself, she assured him, beyond a shadow of a doubt, by her laugh, her poise, her competence [. . .] that it was real" (38). Simultaneously, James feels her "rise in a rosy-flowered fruit tree laid with leaves and dancing boughs" (38). Mrs. Ramsay's point of view emerges victorious, and with gratitude, Mr. Ramsay feels "restored [and] renewed" (38), leaving the room to go watch his children play cricket outside. Mrs. Ramsay reconnects her husband to his family and to the world. Knitting needles act as her tools, and trees act as her emblem. Mrs. Ramsay's greatest achievement of unification in the novel is relativistic and occurs at the dinner table where she orders her environment like a large body of mass influencing the curvature of spacetime. Like Clarissa, Mrs. Ramsay "organizes space by instituting and maintaining a human network" (Stockton 105), and feels "a sense of being [. . .] through everything" (Woolf, Lighhouse 83). Unlike Clarissa, whose guests voluntarily arrive at her party, Mrs. Ramsay entertains guests that are unwilling participants. Her husband sits at the far end of the table "all in a heap, frowning" (83). Mr.Tansley "had been reading in his room, and now he came down and it all seemed to him silly, superficial, flimsy" (85). Mr. Bankes thinks just how "trifling it all is, how boring [. . .] compared with [. . .] work" (89), while Lily copes with the situation by obsessing over her painting. All the dinner guests are initially separated by concerns with their own affairs, and the efforts of socializing seem like a weight that Mrs. Ramsay compels them to bear. Mr. Bankes in particular "must make himself talk. Unless he were very careful, [Mrs. Ramsay] would find out this treachery of his; that he did not care a straw for her, and that would not be at all pleasant" (89-90). Aware of her guests' unfavorable dispositions, Mrs. Ram say realizes from the beginning that "the whole effort of merging and flowing and creating rested on her" (83) and achieves the unity she desires by a series of silent communiques. Lily feels pressured into talking to Tansley because,</page><page sequence="7">Relativity, Quantum Physics, and Consciousness in To the Lighthouse 45 Mrs. Ramsay said to her, as in effect she did, "I am drowning, my dear, in seas of fire. Unless you apply some balm to the anguish of this hour and say something nice to that young man there, life will run upon the rocks ? indeed I hear the grating and the growling at this minute. My nerves are taut as fiddle strings. Another touch and they will snap"?when Mrs. Ramsay said all this, as the glance in her eyes said it, of course for the hundred and fiftieth time Lily Briscoe had to renounce the experiment?what happens if one is not nice to that young man there ? and be nice. (92) Mrs. Ramsay carries on similar silent conversations with nearly all of her guests, binding them to her and to each other by directly accessing and sharing the unex pressed thoughts beneath the words and the silences. She and her husband "([. . .] looked at each other down the long table sending these questions and answers across, each knowing exactly what the other felt)" (96). As the evening progresses, her "eyes were so clear that they seemed to go round the table unveiling each of these people, and their thoughts and their feelings, without effort like a light stealing under water" (106). Based on her intuitions and silent interactions, Mrs. Ramsay directs surface events accordingly, including where everyone is to sit, the lighting of the candles, and the placement of the dishes of food. Through a com bination of efforts, "Some change [. . .] went through them all [. . .] and they were [. . .] conscious of making a party together in a hollow, on an island" (97). Mrs. Ramsay's orchestrations and influence also extend beyond the ordered table. Not only does she arrange the spaces that surround her according to a form she both intuits and creates, but she is capable of attracting and influencing ele ments that at first appear outside of her control. She thinks, "They must come now [. . .] looking at the door, and at that instant, Minta Doyle, Paul Rayley, and a maid carrying a great dish in her hands came in together" (98). Mrs. Ramsay's influence is such that even distant bodies come under her sway. As a force that is "irresistible [. . .] She put a spell on them all" (101), and only when she eventually decides to leave the room does "a sort of disintegration set in" (112). Her successful act of union is exemplified by Mr. Bankes's change of heart. Of the bceufen daube, Mr. Bankes claims, "Tt is a triumph'" and "lay[s] his knife down [. . .] All his love, all his rever ence, had returned; and she knew it" (100). It appears that Mrs. Ramsay has been aware of Mr. Bankes's thoughts of "treachery "all along and has vanquished them in a fashion similar to the way in which she dispels her husband's fears. Bankes puts down the masculine knife, silently communicating his willing submission to the connectedness that Mrs. Ramsay has effected. Not only does the relative force of Mrs. Ramsay bring others together spatially, but she also has the capacity to warp and slow time. As she "help[s] Mr. Bankes to a specially tender piece, of eternity" (105), for example, the moment of the gathering grows "immune from change, and shines out [...] in the face of the flowing, the fleeting, the spectral, like a ruby" (105). Time is frozen. Just as in the theory of "general relativity [. ..] time [. . .] appears to run slower near a massive body" (Hawking 32), Mrs. Ramsay's attractive force has a similar effect to that of gravity on the temporal dimension as well as the spatial. She has the capacity to slow time until the moment can crystallize.14</page><page sequence="8">46 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 3 Another indication of Mrs. Ramsay's relative nature stems from her associa tion with the abstract. In regard to the slowing of time near large bodies of mass, Einstein writes in Relativity: The Special and the General Theory, that understand ing the relationship between curved space and time "lays no small claims on the patience and on the power of abstraction of the reader" (88), and most physicists deem the special and general theories of relativity alike to be quintessentially abstract theories bordering on the sublime.15 Although it will take Lily Briscoe to fully depict the relative nature of Mrs. Ramsay, Mrs. Ramsay intuits her own abstract qualities as well. She believes that she is "a wedge-shaped core of darkness, something invisible to others. Although she continued to knit, and sat upright, it was thus that she felt herself" (Woolf, Lighthouse 62). Her sense of being a "wedge shaped core of darkness" foreshadows Lily's depiction of her as an "odd-shaped triangular shadow" (201). This form of Mrs. Ramsay is still "invisible to others" while she is alive, but it is one that Lily will finally realize in the modern era. Though Mrs. Ramsay does not paint her self-portrait, she occasionally visualizes the world as being constituted of similar abstractions: "putting a yellow against a purple, a curved shape against a round shape, without knowing why she did it" (109). When Lily decides to take up painting again in the third section of the novel, "The Lighthouse," she initially recalls "a little sprig or leaf pattern on the table-cloth, which she had looked at in a moment of revelation" (147), but decides to move uaway from representationalism" (Beer, Virginia Woolf 37-38). Lily's maturation as an artist coincides with her abil ity to see past the emblem of the tree, so pivotal to her painting ten years previous, to Mrs. Ramsay's innermost conception of herself as a shadowy, triangular shape. Mrs. Ramsay appears to influence Lily's transformation from beyond the grave by her pseudo reappearance as a ghost. Lily's "heart leapt at her and seized her and tortured her. 'Mrs. Ramsay! Mrs. Ramsay!' [. . . She] sat there quite simply, in the chair, flicked her needles to and fro [. . .] cast her shadow on the step. There she sat" (Woolf, Lighthouse 202). With the assistance of Mrs. Ramsay's spectral pres ence, Lily renders the abstract cast shadow as the unifying presence instead of a realistic portrait or a symbolic tree. Of all the forms that Woolf would have Mrs. Ramsay believing herself to resemble or would have Lily imagine befitting her as well, the "odd-shaped triangular shadow" (201) seems the one most suitable to the concept of relativity.16 This shape, including its shadowy sides, fits the exact description offered by Cologne Minkowski, Einstein's former math teacher and the first one to formulate the theory of relativity in mathematical terms. During his 1908 lecture entitled "Space and Time," which "created a tremendous stir and has since been recognized as a watershed moment in our understanding of physical reality" (Krauss 42), Minkowski asserted that "Henceforward space on its own and time on its own will decline into mere shadows, and only a kind of union between the two will preserve its independence" (qtd. in Greene 66).To help illustrate the special theory of relativity, he advocated thinking of time as one side of a right triangle, space the other, and spacetime as the hypotenuse. Fred Alan Wolf explains:</page><page sequence="9">Relativity, Quantum Physics, and Consciousness in To the Lighthouse 47 Minkowski's amazing insight was that the invariance found by Einstein was similar to the simple right triangle invariance found in ordinary geometry. What Minkowski noticed was that if you regard time as a dimension of space, and you construct right triangles with one adjacent side corresponding to time and the other to space, you will find a spacetime invariance similar to the invariance found for the right triangles inscribed in a semicircle. You must make one slight adjustment. You must think of time as an imaginary or new dimension of space. (122)1 In terms of Lily's painting, the "odd" ("imaginary or new") shape of the "shadowy" triangle serves to identify it as an abstract representation of Mrs. Ramsay and rela tivity. Mrs. Ramsay's former link with the lighthouse and its beams also suggests a parallel to Bertrand Russell's description of a beacon that represents the sun, and daylight that "corresponds to the coming of Einstein" (128). Nevertheless, it is this same association of Mrs. Ramsay with an inanimate object that reveals the par ticularity of Woolf s vision. Not only does Mrs. Ramsay exemplify all the qualities of a body in relative spacetime, reinforcing the notion of a postrelativity world that first manifested itself in Mrs. Dalloway, but also, like Clarissa and Septimus, Mrs. Ramsay's capacity to stretch outside of herself expresses a philosophical standpoint that progresses beyond relativity. The difference between Woolf s viewpoint and that of her father and Ein stein makes itself apparent through the contrast between the table as an object of permeability and connectivity versus the table as an object of independence and separation. The dinner table that acts as Mrs. Ramsay's primary domain of influ ence and unification is juxtaposed in the novel with Mr. Ramsay's kitchen table that represents the isolated and unperceived object. According to Banfield, "The table is interposed between Woolf s woman-artist and the philosopher, placing the problem of knowledge at the center of Woolf s art. To Lily's consternation, she finds her gaze riveted to the same object [of] the philosopher" (Banfield, Phantom 49). Throughout the novel, Lily is both repelled by and attracted to Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay, pondering the character of each and incorporating their worldviews into her artistic vision. Lily has chosen to put her work before anything else, a trait she has in common with Mr. Bankes. Mr. Ramsay has chosen a middle road between career and family, but it is with his work that Lily is most fascinated: Whenever she "thought of his work" she always saw clearly before her a large kitchen table. It was Andrew's doing. She asked him what his father's books were about. "Sub ject and object and the nature of reality," Andrew had said [. . .] "Think of a kitchen table [. . .]" he told her, "when you're not there." So now she always saw, when she thought of Mr. Ramsay's work, a scrubbed kitchen table. It lodged now in the fork of a pear tree, for they had reached the orchard. And with a painful effort of concentration, she focused her mind, not upon the silver-bossed bark of the tree, or upon its fish shaped leaves, but upon a phantom kitchen table. (Woolf, Lighthouse 23) By lodging Mr. Ramsay's kitchen table in the fork of a tree, Lily can't help but situate his life and career in direct relation to Mrs. Ramsay, and she must try very</page><page sequence="10">48 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 3 hard to think of the table separately from the bark and the leaves. To understand Mr. Ramsay's beliefs, Lily must distinguish the wood of the table from the wood of the tree and ignore this obvious connection, a connection more in line with Mrs. Ramsay's worldview. Woolf's choice of the kitchen table as an object of contemplation for Lily not only serves to conveniently contrast with Mrs. Ramsay's dinner table, but the table itself acts as "the paradigmatic object of knowledge in 'the history of English thought" (Banfield, Phantom 66) and the prototypical object referred to by Ste phen?whose description of which closely parallels Einstein's description of the special theory of relativity. According to Stephen: "This is a table" is a phrase which in the first place asserts that I have a certain set of organised sense-impressions. But it also means that you have an analogous set of impressions, and that if we changed places we should also change sensations. It is a compact formula, which not only indicates the sensations of an observer at a particular time and place, but also gives the sensations of every other observer as those which would be perceived by the same observer at other times and places. ("What" 137-38) For Einstein, the rules of physics are the same for everyone regardless of their relative position and speed in spacetime (they share "a certain set of organised sense-impressions"), even though their measurements of distance and time regard ing others in motion relative to them may vary (that is, "if we changed places we should also change sensations").18 Nevertheless, this variance between different observers in relative motion to one another still acts as a "set of analogous impres sions." Every observer can calculate the precise perceptions of time and distance that others will have because "all possible states of motion of the observer and their statements about physical events are connected by mathematical transforma tions" (Pauli 115).19 Indeed, relativity is precisely the analogous "compact formula, which not only indicates the sensations of an observer at a particular time and place, but also gives the sensations of every other observer as those which would be perceived by the same observer at other times and places" (Stephen, "What" 137-138) described in Stephen's conception of the philosophical underpinnings of the phrase "this is a table." The importance of the exacting similarity between Stephen's description of the phrase "this is a table" and Einstein's guidelines for the special theory of relativity cannot be overemphasized. The concordances between her father's understanding of perception and Einstein's understanding of space and time demonstrate why Woolf had an interest in relativity. Despite the interests and beliefs that Woolf shares with Stephen and Einstein, however, she overtly questions their shared presumption of subjects and objects that occupy distinct and imper meable locations. The contrast set up between the two tables in the novel serves to introduce the debate over objectivity. Mr. Ramsay's table exists independently of its observation, whereas Mrs. Ramsay's table is a participatory "object," interacting and changing with the forces of her consciousness. Mrs. Ramsay has a holistic relationship to the world around her, which con founds the notion that subjects and objects are specifically located and bounded.</page><page sequence="11">Relativity, Quantum Physics, and Consciousness in 7b the Lighthouse 49 Her capacity for silently communicating with so many others, and for knowing exactly what they are thinking, borders on the paranormal and appears to cross over the boundaries of the autonomous mind. In spite of her remarkable capaci ties in this regard, however, her perceptive intuition may be partially attributed to acute observational skills and a highly developed sense of human psychology and social behavior. After all, as a mother of eight and a hostess of many others, she has certainly had ample opportunity to develop her perceptive abilities. But not only does Mrs. Ramsay feel connected to people, she also feels a strong attachment to the objects in her environment: Not as oneself did one find rest ever, in her experience (she accomplished here some thing dexterous with her needles) but as a wedge of darkness. Losing personality, one lost the fret, the hurry, the stir; and there rose to her lips always some exclamation of triumph over life when things came together in this peace, this rest, this eternity; and pausing there she looked out to meet that stroke of the Lighthouse, the long steady stroke, the last of the three, which was her stroke, for watching them in this mood always at this hour one could not help attaching oneself to one thing especially of the things one saw; and this thing, the long steady stroke, was her stroke. Often she found herself sitting and looking, sitting and looking, with her work in her hands until she became the thing she looked at?that light, for example [. . .] She looked up over her knitting and met the third stroke and it seemed to her like her own eyes meeting her own eyes [. . .] It was odd, she thought, how if one was alone, one leant to inanimate things; trees, streams, flowers; felt they expressed one; felt they became one; felt they knew one, in a sense were one; felt an irrational tenderness thus. (Woolf, Lighthouse 63) Mrs. Ramsay's feelings of "irrational tenderness" toward inanimate objects such as the lighthouse and its beam demonstrate that her emotions are more than simply sentimental. Her sense of oneness and connection is irrational to her because she realizes that Mr. Ramsay would not understand it. Nevertheless, her capacities reach beyond what can simply be dismissed as imagination. By the second section of the novel, in fact, it seems as though "Mrs. Ramsay, in her death, has become the long stroke of light from the Lighthouse, wandering about the house and land like a protective spirit" (Kelley 134). The anthropomorphic light beam, "gliding gently as if it laid its caress and lingering stealthily and look[ing] and [coming] lovingly again" (Woolf, Lighthouse 132-33), reflects what Mrs. Ramsay once projected. From Mrs. Ramsay's standpoint of oneness with the beam, however, both she and the beam simultaneously reflect and project each other, so distinguishing between the two entities is a misapplication of formal rationalization or an a priori assumption of distinctness between subjects and objects. Mrs. Ramsay categorizes her holistic vision as "irrational" because she intui tively recognizes that the principles of formalism do not apply to her notions of reality.20 Woolf offers indirect insight into Mrs. Ramsay's sensibility: "if we escape a little from the common sitting-room and see human beings not always in their relation to each other but in relation to [. . .] the sky, too, and the trees or whatever it may be in themselves [. . . we see] our relation is to the world [. . .] and not only</page><page sequence="12">50 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 3 to the world of men and women" (Room 112, emphasis added). Mrs. Ramsay feels her identity knit together with the environment. She not only affects time in a relative way, she also exists as a culmination of her relations within a space that is not always rigidly subdivided. She has the capacity to retain her individuality like a point or disperse herself like a wave that inhabits the space of all points. It is a striking coincidence that points and waves permeate Woolf s work, from the island-ocean metaphors and associated imagery throughout To the Lighthouse to the title of her book The Waves, and that Mrs. Ramsay has one of her most revelatory feelings of connectedness with a beam of light; the study of radiative phenomena by physicists in the early 1900s revealed the baffling fact that light and matter express the paradoxical properties of being both particles and waves. Max Planck discovered quanta (discrete and indivisible packets of energy) in December 1900. In 1905, Einstein adapted Planck's findings to explain the photoelectric effect,21 even though he felt "the concept of the quanta and all of its unsettling implications [was] heuristic at best: provisional and incomplete and not fully compatible with his own intimations of underlying reality" (Isaacson 94). At first, Planck understood his own constant as a mathematical contrivance. Einstein would initially perceive it as merely instructive, and later as "a perplexing, pesky, mysteri ous, and sometimes maddening quirk in the cosmos" (Isaacson 99). Nevertheless, experiments repeatedly confirmed that the quantum was an undeniable component of reality. What made this discovery so "maddening" to Einstein was that it was a discontinuous element that could not be subdivided. Therefore?whether in regard to electrons in an atom or nuclear radiation, for example?a change could occur spontaneously and randomly, without warning or apparent cause. The "state" of an entity could morph instantaneously, profoundly calling into question the notions of identity and locality. Coupled with the discovery of the quantum, the particle-like property of energy, is the concurrent, yet paradoxical, wave-like property of all light and matter.22 The most famous experiment revealing the strange properties of light as both a particle and a wave is the double-slit experiment, the basic version of which was first performed by Thomas Young in the early 1800s. In the double slit experiment, an opaque surface with two slits cut into it is placed between a beam of light and a photographic plate. If one slit is closed and a beam of light is shone through it, a dot-type pattern appears on the photographic plate, exhibiting the particle-like property of light. If both slits are open, however, the beam of light acts as a wave interfering with itself and materializes as a pattern of light and dark bands on the photographic plate. If, however, only one photon (or "particle" of light) is allowed to pass through the double-slit partition at a time, then a pattern of light and dark bands composed of tiny dots still appears on the photographic plate, as if either a single particle traveled through both slits simultaneously and interfered with itself, or as if each particle knew ahead of time which path to take in order to create the wavelike pattern. Such paradoxical and inexplicable behavior subverts the notion of location in space. It also suggests that "individual" particles exist in a holistic relation ship with other "individual" particles. Scientists David Bohm and B.J. Hiley explain:</page><page sequence="13">Relativity, Quantum Physics, and Consciousness in To the Lighthouse 51 One is led to a new notion of unbroken wholeness which denies the classical idea of analyzability of the world into separate and independently existing parts ... we have reversed the usual classical notion that independent "elementary parts" of the whole are the fundamental reality and that the various systems are merely the particular contingent forms and arrangements of these parts. Rather we say that the inseparable quantum interconnectedness of the whole universe is the fundamental reality, and that relatively independently behaving parts are merely particular and contingent forms within the whole, (qtd. in Glynn 103)23 Mrs. Ramsay's intuitive sense of connection to the lighthouse beam and to the world at large is virtually parallel to the connections between subatomic "particles" discovered by quantum physicists. The waves and points in Woolf's novels or "the impression of the waves and the acorn on the blind" (Woolf, Moments of Being 65) are exacting metaphors for the perplexing and exciting discoveries in science made during the first third of the twentieth century when relativity successfully usurped Newton's conception of absolute time and quantum interconnectedness profoundly problematized the notion of objectivity. Much like the disparate epistemologies that developed in the real world of science, Woolf s fictional characters possess starkly conflicting views along similar philosophical lines in regard to time, space, objectivity and locality.24 The discord between Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay is not simply personal, involving such issues as, for example, telling James whether or not he'll be able to go to the lighthouse tomorrow. It centers on different conceptions of reality and knowledge. Mrs. Ram say's holistic vision is opposed to Mr. Ramsay's compartmental one. He divides knowledge into letters of the alphabet, and wonders if "he had, or might have had, the power to repeat every letter of the alphabet from A to Z accurately in order" (Woolf, Lighthouse 34-35). Ironically, Mr. Ramsay remains "stuck at QT (35) for "Qhe was sure of. QJie could demonstrate" (34), but he cannot get past Qjto R. More than an arbitrary letter in the alphabet, R is Mr. Ramsay's initial and the first letter in the word "reality." For all of his acquired knowledge, Mr. Ramsay struggles with the fact that he cannot understand himself or the world. Since To the Lighthouse is Woolf's single most autobiographical novel, and the character of Mr. Ramsay acts as her fictional father, it is likely that she borrowed from her real father's work. In his essay "What is Materialism?", Stephen writes "We cannot peep behind the curtain [. . .] The curtain is the reality. The effort to look behind it is an effort to get out of ourselves [. . .] The unknowable [. . .] is not made into a reality by its capital letter" (144). Instead, Stephen claims that "we cannot get into a region beyond knowledge which will explain to us why there should be a world at all, or why it should be such a world as we know. We must be content to trace the facts and their laws; to infer to-day from yesterday, and to-morrow from to-day" ("What" 144). Not only does the capital letter R make its appearance in the mind of the real as well as the fictional father, but the linearity of "to-day from yesterday, and to-morrow from to-day" is echoed in Mr. Ramsay's struggle to get from A to Z. Like Woolf s father, Mr. Ramsay feels he must focus on facts and laws</page><page sequence="14">52 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 3 and discernable cause and effect relationships. His quest for R (reality), however, indicates that he is not quite willing to forego the possibility of uncovering the world beyond the senses, despite the fact that the real-life person upon whom he is based understood such a quest as one that was likely to remain unfulfilled. The fictional Mr. Ramsay seems to share a view similar to Einstein's who, "during the more than four decades in which he would express his discomfort with quantum theory [. . .] increasingly sounded like a scientific realist, someone who believed that an underlying reality existed in nature that was independent of our ability to observe or measure it" (Isaacson 169).25 Mrs. Ramsay, on the other hand, sometimes thinks that "To pursue truth with such astonishing lack of consideration for other people's feelings [...] was [... a] horrible [...] outrage of human decency" (Woolf, Lighthouse 32), reflecting a sense that human beings cannot be removed from the world in which they live; they cannot wholly objectify their environment. At other times, "she [. . .] felt she was nothing but a sponge sopped full of human emotions. Then he said, Damn you. He said, It must rain. He said, It won't rain; and instantly a Heaven of security opened before her" (32). Mrs. Ramsay is rarely alone or isolated and never questions the existence of her surroundings. However, her intuitive sense of permeable boundaries between subjects and objects carries with it the risk of a loss of a definable self and the possibility of total submersion into the fluid world. Like Clarissa, she must be the mermaid and maintain a sense of individuality while acting to connect others.26 Otherwise, she may suffer the same fate as Septimus. Her husband's logical formalism keeps her afloat. Even though Mrs. Ramsay must rely on her husband's sense of rationality to maintain her own sanity and security, her sense of holism cannot be subsumed by or reduced to the principles of her husband's formalism. Far from abandoning the classical principles of logic and empiricism, quantum physicists must also rely on the principles of logical formalism. At the same time, they cannot ignore the compromise that this entails. Niels Bohr explains: we have been forced step by step to forego a causal description of the behaviour of indi vidual atoms in space and time [. . . However,] we have gradually reached a complete understanding of the intimate connection between the renunciation of causality in the quantum-mechanical description and the limitation with regard to the possibility of distinguishing between phenomena and their observation [. . .]. (Atomic 1: 4?5) Since scientists are unable to simultaneously trace the path and momentum of subatomic particles without disrupting them, they cannot predict the exact out come of an experiment prior to its performance. In macro-physics, however, the same experimental set-up will yield the same results, allowing the scientist to infer a causal chain of events. Due to the holistic nature of subatomic phenomena, however, quantum scientists are able to determine the boundaries within which the a-causality occurs and can offer a precise set of statistical probabilities that, within set limits, allow the phenomena to be comprehended with the use of formal logic. Mrs. Ramsay experiences a reality that defies a totalized rationality as well, but she must also rely on the tenets of traditional logic to prevent the unraveling</page><page sequence="15">Relativity, Quantum Physics, and Consciousness in To the Lighthouse 53 of the idealizations that order the rest of her existence. The holistic nature of Mrs. Ramsay's world or the world of the quantum physicist cannot be explained by any attempt at reducing them to their parts.27 For Mrs. Ramsay, her connection to the lighthouse beam is undeniable but "irrational" at the same time because she directly experiences it, even though such an event exceeds the formal system of logic to which her society is accustomed. Such momentary revelations are potentially dan gerous, as they take her away from the world as others comprehend it. Therefore, she relies on her husband's imperfect rationality to keep her grounded. Understanding the similarities between Woolf s characters and their beliefs and the epistemological problems faced by early twentieth-century physicists proves insightful, but it is equally important to recognize their differences. These distinctions indicate the uniqueness of Woolf's own particular vision. Although a physicist's conscious decision can affect the type of phenomena witnessed and can even appear to reach into the past,28 there is no evidence to suggest that the consciousness of a scientist communicates directly or indirectly with any form of cosmic consciousness. Although some form of real interconnectedness has been observed over and over again in regard to quantum systems, the apparent holistic nature of light and subatomic particles is attributed to wave-like behavior. The individual particles that make up a quantum system seem to be connected by a field. A field is a rather abstractly defined phenomenon and not well understood even in classical physics, but it acts as "something which is continuous in space and time" (Pauli 29) such that "continuously varying numbers [may be] co-ordinated to [its] points" (30).29 A quantum field is more peculiar in that Unlike the fields of classical physics, these [. . .] cannot be measured simultaneously at different places. Making a measurement at one place means that we pass to a new phenomenon with altered initial conditions to which belongs a new set of possibilities [. . .] and accordingly a new field has to be stated everywhere. Thus in atomic phys ics phenomena have a new property of wholeness, in each case changing the [. . .] phenomenon in an essential way. (Pauli 152) The holistic nature of quantum fields is more closely aligned with Mrs. Ramsay's conceptions than a classical field would be. She needs to align the emotions of all of her dinner guests, for example, before she achieves her goal, as a single dissenter will affect the entire effort. However, in contrast to the fields of physics, Woolf's characters are bound to one another and to the world via their consciousness. With Mrs. Ramsay in particular, direct connections between individuals and individuals and objects appear to be made possible through the mind.30 Consciousness is so crucial to the make-up of the world in Woolf's novels that even inanimate objects are imbued with it: "the cliffs looked as if they were conscious of the ships, and the ships looked as if they were conscious of the cliffs, as if they signalled [sic] to each other some message of their own" (Woolf, Lighthouse 182). As Jean O. Love suggests, "within [. . .] Woolf's novels, persons do not have fixed and consistent boundaries. Instead, their minds and consciousnesses and, at times, even themselves as entire beings are confluent with the external world</page><page sequence="16">54 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 3 and influence it in ways empirical thought holds to be impossible" (35). The sense of boundlessness Mrs. Ramsay expresses in regard to both living and inanimate objects, and her capacity to enter in and out of them, directly contradicts the ideologies of Einstein and Stephen.31 It is in this notion of interactivity between observer and observed that Woolf s thought mirrors the tenets of quantum physicists. It also seems to reflect Marcel Proust who, Woolf claims, "(n)o doubt [. . .] could say what I mean?that great writer whom I cannot read when I'm correcting, so persuasive is he" (Diary 2: 322). Proust's world, Georges Poulet contends, "is indeed a world of things, but of interchangeable things, in which nothing is attached to one particular point of space" (151). This would apply to Woolf s fictional worlds, since she constantly sets up fluid boundaries between characters and objects. Woolf's conclusions about reality via Mrs. Ramsay vary from Einstein's, quan tum physicists', and her father's alike in that she seems to posit a reality concomi tant with a collective self-awareness. The interactive and participatory relationship between characters and setting exemplify this sense of awareness. James Naremore writes: in her essay on modern fiction, [Woolf] argues for a literature which will show how the "self" of the interior monologue "embraces or creates what is outside itself or beyond." But the words "embraces" and "creates" are something of a problem, since they postulate two different attitudes toward what is outside. Is the world around us an ultimate order which we can "embrace" by somehow getting outside the ego, or is it a chaos out of which we "create" order through the effort of imagination? Mrs. Woolf is never very clear about her answer, and her fiction provides plenty of evidence to support both notions. (74) In fact, Woolf seems to advocate the simultaneity of creating and embracing as the best way of describing existence. She remarks: "One becomes aware that we are spectators and also [...] participants in a pageant" (Woolf, Moment 9). Bohr echoes her sentiments when he describes the lessons that discoveries in the subatomic realm have taught scientists. He contends that "the new situation in physics has so forc ibly reminded us of the old truth that we are both onlookers and actors in the great drama of existence" (Bohr, Atomic 1:119). For Woolf, reality is not contained within a single perceptual consciousness, nor does it exist as a collection of multiple but rigidly divided perceptual consciousnesses. It is not an entirely boundless collective, nor does it exist as some form of transcendent actuality. The reality depicted in To the Lighthouse seems to be composed of multiple interpenetrating consciousnesses interconnected with one another and loosely housed within fluid subjectivities and objectivities that interactively create, as well as observe, their environment. Woolf's characters reflect her own beliefs, whether it is the holistic intercon nectivity exemplified by Mrs. Ramsay, or the power of art to reconcile differences, as demonstrated by Lily Briscoe. Of her own work, Woolf remarks:</page><page sequence="17">Relativity, Quantum Physics, and Consciousness in To the Lighthouse 55 It is only by putting it into words that I make it whole; this wholeness means that it has lost its power to hurt me; it gives me, perhaps because by doing so I take away the pain, a great delight to put the severed parts together. Perhaps this is the strongest pleasure known to me. It is the rapture I get when in writing I seem to be discovering what belongs to what; making a scene come right; making a character come together. From this I reach what I might call a philosophy; at any rate it is a constant idea of mine; that behind the cotton wool is hidden a pattern; that we?I mean all human beings ? are connected with this; that the whole world is a work of art; that we are parts of that work of art. (Moments of Being 72) For Woolf, a unifying pattern exists behind the arbitrary divisions associated with subjects and objects, which suggests some form of unification in the whole. As evidenced by her novels, the underlying pattern that makes this possible is a form of ubiquitous consciousness. To the Lighthouse presents a complex world defined in part by the principles of relativity and in part by the discoveries of quantum physicists. It is further complicated by seemingly "irrational" emotional and mental connections between characters, and between characters and their environment. Mrs. Ramsay's remarkable beauty stems from her embodiment of all these intricate dimensions, alongside an alluring and deceptively simple sense of purpose: to care for those around her. Notes 1. Fay Chen and Chung-Hsiung Lai compare Woolf's concept of time to Derrida's understanding of it in regard to Hamlet as both "out-of-joint and mad" (231), whereas Mark Hussey asserts that Woolf s conception "is essentially Romantic" (116). C.J. Mares examines the influence of Proust on Woolf in his article "Reading Proust: Woolf and the Painter's Perspective." Harvena Richter connects Woolf to Bergson in her book Virginia Woolf: The Inward Voyage. Josalba Ramalho Vieira offers an understand ing of Woolf s sense of time in the article "Henri Bergson's Idea of Duration and Virginia Woolf s Novels," and Shiv K. Kumar analyzes her work in Bergson and the Stream of Consciousness Novel. Ann Banfield thoroughly examines Woolf s awareness of Einstein via her social connections to members of the Bloomsbury Group and Bertrand Russell in her article "Time Passes: Virginia Woolf, Post Impressionism, and Cambridge Time" and her book The Phantom Table. Gillian Beer looks at Woolf s connection to Einstein's thought in "Physics, Sound and Substance: Later Woolf" in Virginia Woolf: The Common Ground and in her book Wave, Atom, Dinosaur: Woolf s Science. Julia Briggs discusses Woolf's historical relation to Einstein in the chapter "'This Moment I Stand On': Virginia Woolf and the Spaces in Time" in her book Reading Virginia Woolf Sharon Stockton looks at time and relativity in her article "Public Space and Private Time: Perspective in To the Lighthouse and in Einstein's Special Theory," and Allen Thiher claims that "Woolf speculates on the ways in which science permeates daily consciousness" (220). 2. Einstein's name appears in Mrs. Dalloway when Mr. Bentley ponders the departure of the airplane (28), and Woolf directly refers to his theories in A Room of One's Own when she ruminates on the pos sibility that "we could have been sitting at our ease [...,] and the subject of our talk might have been [. . .] physics, the nature of the atom [. . . or] relativity" (21). 3. Amir D. Aczel explains that "Starting in the 1920s, and culminating in 1935, a major debate [over objective reality] would rage within the community of quantum physics. The challenge would be issued by Einstein, and throughout the rest of his life, Bohr would regularly spar with Einstein on the meaning and completeness of the quantum theory" (47).</page><page sequence="18">56 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 3 4. Although Woolf's exposure to quantum theories may not have been direct, Yom observes that "Frequent ruminations on the nature of light, including detailed consideration of the wave-particle duality, appeared in such widely read newspapers as The Times and the Saturday Evening Post" (145). 5. In other words, the dilemma would still persist between whether or not the shift in matter caused the thought, or the thought caused the shift in matter, resembling, as it were, the familiar chicken or egg question. 6. Stephen contends that "we cannot get outside our own consciousness. We know nothing directly except the modifications of our consciousness" ("What" 135). 7. It is not that surprising that Stephen and Einstein contended with similar philosophical questions. According to Heisenberg, "If one follows the great difficulty which even eminent scientists like Einstein had in understanding and accepting the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, one can trace the roots of this difficulty to the Cartesian partition [God, World, I]. This partition has penetrated deeply into the human mind during the three centuries following Descartes and it will take a long time for it to be replaced by a really different attitude toward the problem of reality" (Heisenberg 55). 8. Bohr explains that any "detailed causal tracing of atomic processes is impossible and [. . .] any attempt to acquire a knowledge of such processes involves a fundamentally uncontrollable interference with their course" {Foundations 100). The reason for this is that "the magnitude of disturbance caused by a measurement [of quantum phenomena] is always unknown, since the limitation in question applies to any use of mechanical concepts and, hence, applies to the agencies of observation as well as to the phenomena under investigation. This very circumstance carries with it the fact that any observation takes place at the cost of the connection between the past and the future course of phenomena" (Bohr, Atomic V. 11). 9. "The very fact that repetition of the same experiment [. . .] in general yields different recordings pertaining to the object, immediately implies that a comprehensive account of experience in this field must be expressed by statistical laws" (Bohr, Atomic 3: 4) and that different but equally valid interpretations must be admitted. 10. In quantum physics, it is impossible to measure the same system twice because each measurement unpredictably affects both the history and future of the system. Pauli explains, every irrevocable interference by an observation with the sources of information about a system alters its state, and creates a new phenomenon [. . .] An attempt to subdivide the phenomenon, for instance to follow a particular particle in space and time, creates, in consequence of the [. . .] interaction with the apparatus introduced afresh for this purpose, still another phenomenon, without achieving the aim of the subdivision of the original phenomenon. The latter thus exhib its new features, foreign to the classical description of nature, of indivisibility or wholeness [...] The state of a system (object) being given, only statistical predictions can in general be made about the results of future observations (primary probability), whereas the result of the single observation is not determined by laws, being thus an ultimate fact without a cause. (132-33) Pauli's phrase "fact without cause" may also be understood in the Derridian sense as a trace without origin, wherein the trace may be understood as "the disappearance of origin" or rather "that the origin did not even disappear [. . .] it was never constituted" (Derrida, OfGrammatology 61). As a result of the inability to measure a system without irrevocably affecting it or being able to pinpoint its location or momentum simultaneously, "The concept of the probability wave [...] introduced something standing in the middle between the idea of an event and the actual event, a strange kind of physical reality just in the middle between possibility and reality" (Heisenberg 14-15). 11. Much to Einstein's chagrin, Bohr and his colleagues would successfully demonstrate over and over again that it is impossible to prove the existence of subatomic particles independent of the observations that affect them. In 1922, Bohr would receive the Nobel Prize for his work on quantum theory, and 1935 saw the publication of the famous EPR (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) paper which marked the last concerted effort of Einstein and his colleagues to prove the existence of an objective reality underlying the behavior of subatomic particles interactively observed in quantum experiments. The authors of the</page><page sequence="19">Relativity, Quantum Physics, and Consciousness in To the Lighthouse 57 EPR paper attempted to prove the objective existence of subatomic "reality" by describing a scenario involving entanglement. Entanglement occurs when two or more subatomic particles interact with one another under certain conditions and their fates become intertwined. Whatever happens to one instantaneously affects the other, no matter how spatially separated they may be in the universe . This phenomenon, Robert Penrose argues, "cannot be explained by any model according to which the par ticles are treated as unconnected and independent actual things" (584). Nevertheless, one critical aspect of this phenomenon is that entangled particles cannot communicate with each other using signals faster than the speed of light without violating the theory of relativity, and yet in principle, they can be billions of light years apart and miraculously act in concert. The phenomenon of entanglement radically problematizes the belief in locality that Einstein valued. Ironically, however, he and his supporters claimed that by acting on one entangled particle, the position or momentum of its corresponding twin could be ascertained without disturbing it directly, thereby, providing evidence of its spatial actuality sans any need to interfere with its course. In response to the EPR paper, [Bohr] pointed out that the two particles were part of one whole phenomenon. Because they have interacted, the two particles are therefore "entangled." They are part of one whole phe nomenon or one whole system that has one quantum function. In addition the EPR paper did not, as Bohr noted, truly dispel [the fact . . .] that it is not possible to know both the precise position and momentum of a particle at the same moment. Einstein is correct, that if we measure the position of particle A, we can indeed know the. position of its distant twin B. Likewise, if we measure the momentum of A, we can know the momentum of B. However, even if we can imagine measuring the position and then the momentum of particle A, and thus ascribe a "reality" to those attributes in particle B, we cannot in fact measure both these attributes at any one time for particle A, and thus we cannot know them precisely for particle B. (Isaacson 452) Bohr's response would settle the question once and for all in favor of his more subjective view that allowed for a virtual understanding of quantum phenomena as potentialities rather than fixable entities. As a result, the overwhelming majority of physicists would come to accept that the belief in a wholly objective subatomic "reality" could not be validated, and the question would be forever relegated to the realm of metaphysical speculation. 12. In Mrs. Dalloway, Elizabeth thinks, "it was beginning.. . . People were beginning to compare her to poplar trees" (134). 13. As Clarissa walks the streets of London, she imagines "making [London (and life)] up, building it round one, tumbling it, creating it every moment afresh" (Woolf, Mrs. Dalloway 4). 14. Woolf's belief in the importance of the moment in time is evident in her work and in her personal writings. She describes the center of the moment as "a knot of consciousness[,] a nucleus divided [. . .] not subject to the law of the sun" (Moment 10). This description reveals an important link that Woolf makes between the instant frozen in time and its dependence upon a collective consciousness. 15. Pauli asserts that the idea of space and time presented by the theory of relativity "became a more abstract description [. . .] in which continuous functions depending on a frame of reference occurred" (30). Bohr submits that "our whole space-time view of physical phenomena, as well as the definition of energy and momentum, depends ultimately upon [. . .] abstractions" (Atomic 1: 77). 16. Mrs. Ramsay's traditional role may at first seem supplanted by a new and more modern sensibility, but her form hasn't so much been supplanted as fully realized. After all, it is usually assumed that the universe was relative (and quantum) previous to scientists' comprehension of the fact. Living through the war and into the modern era allows Lily to fully comprehend Mrs. Ramsay's nature in hindsight. 17. Wolf offers an additional explanation of Minkowski's choice of the triangle as the representative shape for relativity: Whenever it is possible to find a set of equations, as Einstein did, that produce the same physically observable phenomena in spite of observational differences when seen from different</page><page sequence="20">58 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 3 viewpoints, physicists say we have an invariant relationship [. . .] Now there are many invariant relationships in ordinary geometry. For example, if you draw a semicircle including the diameter [. . .] and then from any point on the circle draw two straight lines to the ends of the diameter, you will find that you always construct a right triangle [. . .] All right triangles lying within a semicircle [. . .] have the same invariant hypotenuse ? the diameter of the circle. (121) 18. This idea functions as the first postulate of his theory: "All laws of physics take the same form for all observers in uniform motion (that is, with velocities constant in size and direction) relative to each other" (Pais 69). 19. Bohr explains that "Although the convenient formulation of the theory involves mathematical abstractions as four-dimensional non-Euclidean geometry, its physical interpretation rests fundamen tally on every observer's possibility of maintaining a sharp separation between space and time and of surveying how any other observer, in his frame, will describe and coordinate experience by means of the common language" {Atomic 1: 10). 20. Formalism is used here in the sense of Mr. Ramsay's A-Z linear logic, whereby axioms or objects may be represented in their totality by signs in relation to one another within a self-contained system. Any wave-like or interpenetrating fusion of signs proves incongruous with a system dependent upon the representation of totalized and bounded entities. 21. The photoelectric effect refers to "the emission of electrons from a metal surface irradiated by light with (sufficiently high) frequency" (Pais 230). 22. According to Bohr, "de Broglie [recognized] in 1925 that the wave-corpuscle duality was not confined to the properties of radiation, but was equally unavoidable in accounting for the behaviour of material particles" (Atomic 2: 37). 23. Pauli further elucidates the conditions that define quantum phenomena as holistic: An interference setup for a photon [or electron, etc.] is accordingly a single whole; it cannot be decomposed into causal sequences which can be followed in space and time, of further events in which the photon is concerned. Every attempt in this way to follow the photon in space and time would destroy the interference phenomenon by indeterminable changes in the position of the parts of the apparatus. The finiteness of the quantum of action, which precludes a subdivision of individual quantum processes, thus confronts the physicist with the following situation: it is impossible to take account, by determinable corrections, of the whole influence of the measuring apparatus on the object measured. Every gain in knowledge of atomic objects by observation has to be paid for by an irrevocable loss of some other knowledge [. . .] What knowledge is gained and what is irrevocably lost is left to the experimenter's free choice between mutually exclusive experimental arrangements. (39) 24. It should be emphasized that the findings of quantum physics were not the only topics of debate. Einstein's theories were not embraced by all physicists either:"'Relativity Theory had an unusual impact upon both the scientific and the lay public. For the scientist it came as a psychological shock of some magnitude to be told that many, if not most, of his cherished fundamental assumptions were wrong. Some made the transition to the new mechanics rather easily; for others, the change was a painful one, not always successfully managed" (Williams 117). In a span of twenty years, "the whole picture of the physical universe [. ..] was brought into question" (Bullock 66). 25. Pais explains that, In contrast to the view that the notion of phenomenon irrevocably includes the specifics of the conditions of experimental observation, Einstein held that one should seek for a deeper-lying theoretical framework which permits the description of phenomena independently of these conditions. This is what he meant by the term objective reality [. . .] It was his almost solitary con viction that quantum mechanics is logically consistent, but that it is an incomplete manifestation of an underlying theory in which an objectively real description is possible. (433)</page><page sequence="21">Relativity, Quantum Physics, and Consciousness in To the Lighthouse 59 26. At her party, Clarissa struggles to maintain her sense of self while being an accommodating hostess. Her dual roles as a social creature and an individual are reflected by the hybridity of her outfit, described as "a silver-green mermaid's dress" (Woolf, Mrs. Dalloway 174). 27. For quantum physicists, "the feature of wholeness typical of proper quantum phenomena finds its logical expression in the circumstance that any attempt at a well-defined subdivision would demand a change in the experimental arrangement incompatible with the definition of the phenomena under investigation" (Bohr, Atomic 3: 4). In regard to the double-slit experiment described above, closing one slit in the experimental arrangement eliminates the possibility of observing the wavelike nature of light. In a similar fashion, attempting to locate an electron in space will require foregoing the knowledge of its momentum and vice versa. 28. Depending on the experimental set-up decided upon by the physicist, light, for example, will display particle-like properties or wave-like properties by either traveling in a straight path or by appearing to travel in two separate paths, and then interfering with itself. By inserting a half-silvered mirror into an experimental arrangement at the last possible instant, a physicist's actions in the present appear to affect the path taken by a particle of light, so that by a delayed choice "the experimenter can change history" (Aczel 92). In other words, a light quantum can travel from point A to point B, or by inserting a half-silvered mirror (also called a beam splitter) just before the endpoint at B, a photon will appear to have traveled two routes simultaneously. This phenomena not only occurs in the laboratory, but can also be duplicated on a cosmic scale if "light emitted from a quasar passes by an intervening galaxy, which serves as a gravitational lens" (Nadeau and Kafatos 186). Then the "light here travels two paths?in a straight-line path from the quasar and in a bent path caused by the gravitational lens. Inserting a half-silvered mirror at the end of the two paths with a photon detector behind each mirror, we should arrive at the conclusion that the light has indeed followed the two paths. If, however, we observe the light in the absence of the half-silvered mirror, our conclusion would be that the light traveled in only one path and only one detector would register a photon. What we have done here is chosen to measure the wave or particle aspects of this light with quite different results. When we insert the half-silvered mirror, the wave aspect is apparent as reflection, refraction, and interference; the particle aspect is appar ent when the mirror is removed and the photon is observed by a single detector. What is dramatic in this experiment is that we seem to be determining the path of light traveling for billions of years by an act of measurement in the last fraction of a second" (Nadeau and Kafatos 186-87). The consequences of this situation are such that the physicist is "presented with a choice of either tracing the path of a particle or observing interference effects [. ..] and [is.. .] faced with the impossibility [. ..] of drawing any sharp separation between an independent behaviour of atomic objects and their interaction with the measuring instruments which serve to define the conditions under which the phenomena occur" (Bohr, Atomic 2: 46-47). 29. The electromagnetic field is an example of a classical field. Pauli contends that, the classical field concept arises by abstraction from the conditions under which the field can be measured. A duality is thereby introduced between the field and its sources [. . .] It appears to me an unsatisfactory feature of the classical field concept that a single field which does not interact with other objects, and therefore stands outside the complementarity of instruments of observation and system observed and can never be measured, is nevertheless logically possible in this theory although it is physically unreal. (131) 30. It should be noted that some psychologists have understood the subconscious in terms of a field: [The electromagnetic] field was thought of as real, regardless of whether or not it was made visible by suitable means (charged bodies, iron filings, magnetic needle etc.); in just the same way reality was ascribed to the unconscious as a marginal layer of subliminal "contents," which can however in some circumstances exert considerable influence upon events apprehended in consciousness. This comparison between a psychic layer, not directly perceptible, surrounding consciousness, and a physical field, in particular a magnetic field, was actually made by William James as far back as 1902: "The important fact which this 'field'formula commemorates is the</page><page sequence="22">60 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 3 indetermination of the margin. Inattentively realized as is the matter which the margin contains, it is nevertheless there, and helps both to guide our behavior and to determine the next move ment of our attention. It lies around us like a 'magnetic field,'inside of which our center of energy turns like a compass-needle, as the present phase of consciousness alters into its successor. Our whole past store of memories floats beyond its margin, ready at a touch to come in; and the entire mass of residual powers, impulses, and knowledges that constitute our empirical self stretches continuously beyond it. So vaguely drawn are the outlines between what is actual and what is only potential at any moment of our conscious life, that it is always hard to say of certain mental elements whether we are conscious of them or not."This subliminal something, which guides consciousness as it were from behind the scenes, was called the "subconscious." (Pauli 150-51) In Woolf s novels, however, her characters seem to connect consciously. 31. Einstein contends, "'There is one supposition we should, in my opinion, absolutely hold fast: the real factual situation of the system S2 is independent of what is done with the system Si, which is spatially separated from the former'" (qtd. in Isaacson 449). Isaacson asserts that Einsteins claim "was so intuitive that it seemed obvious. But as Einstein noted, it was a 'supposition.' It had never been proven" (449). Clearly, Mrs. Ramsay's experience with the lighthouse and her capacity to know another's thoughts goes against Einstein's line of reasoning, and against the logical assumptions of Woolf's father as well.
