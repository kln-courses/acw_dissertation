<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS from the Linear B tablets that document administrative bureaus concerned with the storage and distribution of goods active on the first floor of the CPS area. Third, Panagiotaki quite robustly demolishes the Tri- partite Shrine (235-8): it has been tottering for some time. At least on the ground floor, Evans's reconstruction must be discarded, although it is arguable (ifunprovable) that such a shrine, made of light materials, might have existed up on the first floor. There is thus no evidence for cult on the ground floor of the CPS in this last phase (241). Only two bits of evidence might suggest cult activ- ities at that time on the first floor: (1) the Mistress of the Mountains sealings that fell from above (240, 275)-but, even if one accepts a connection between the imagery on the original gold ring and the room where the seal- ings were impressed (as I myself have argued for the dolphin gold ring used in the Queen's Megaron area), this need mean no more than a specialized bureaucrat dealing in materials some of which are perhaps destined for cult purposes; and (2) the vases which fell into the Stone Vase Room, of which nine of the 16 are rhyta (274). The rhyta, however, all seem to be of LM IA man- ufacture (R. Koehl, pers. comm.), while the faience "tea- pot" is contemporary in technique and style with the faience of the TR (PM II 824). We must necessarily won- der if these objects did not tumble down somewhat earli- er, perhaps in mature LM IA, when localized damage may well have been caused by fresh earth tremors. There is a great deal of detail in this book, but all so well organized and presented that, when I had finished, I was longing to read more: what happens over the next wall? I hope that Panagiotaki has the stamina to follow on with her research into adjacent areas of the Palace (as she herself proposes [6]), and with equally fruitful and thoughtful results.

No actual examples of the great body shields of the Aegean Bronze Age survive, but they are well known, both from Bronze Age art, such as the Mycenae Lion Hunt dagger, and through the filter of Homeric narra- tive, from the great shield of Ajax to the less dignified exit of Periphetes tripping over the rim of his shield. This volume is the first full-length study of the Aegean figure-of-eight shield in the second millennium B.C., and its first immediate value lies in making the full range of material (357 examples) readily available for study, since previous discussion has tended to revolve around a small number of particularly well-known examples. The book is well produced and organized, and falls into two distinct parts: discussion and catalogue. The topics treated in the discussion are the development and use of the shield; its origins; construction; typology and chronology; and the ritual dimension. The organizing principles of the catalogue and accom- panying illustrations are material (seals, ceramic, ivory, stone, metal, fresco, glass paste, faience, amber) and prov- enance (in alphabetic order). Presentation of each cate- gory of material in chronological order would have made any patterning or clustering in typological and icono- graphical features more obvious, although the chrono- logical range and the distribution of material geographically and by material is summarized in two use- ful sets of tables. There are a generous number of illus- trations, mainly taken from other publications and therefore of mixed quality. A clear chronological framework emerges with the earliest depictions of figure-of-eight shields found in the prepalatial period in Crete in the glyptic medium. The origins of the shield are therefore considered (in agreement with other scholars) to be Minoan, although the absence of scenes of war in art on Crete means that its practical use as a defensive weapon remains implicit. The earliest evidence for explicit martial us- age comes from the Mycenae Shaft Graves, where the shield's massive size and body protecting abilities are made plain. The figure-of eight shield continues as a symbolic/decorative motif throughout the Bronze Age, but there is a lack of evidence for practical, martial use after LHI-IIA, and the author discusses the likelihood that such shields would have become obsolete with the introduction of bronze body armor. It is also worth not- ing that the massive shield and heavy body armor would have restricted mobility and that they are both suited to highly ritualized modes of combat. There is also a detailed discussion of the vexed issue of the relation- ship between the figure-of-eight shield and the Geo- metric Dipylon shield. Here some illustrations of the later material would have been useful. The chapter on construction from bovid hides and method of use with the telamon strap is thorough and makes extensive use of the Homeric texts as well as the actual Bronze Age material. The use of dappled animal hides with a wooden framework in other high status con- texts is well noted with reference to the ikria of the ships' cabins at Akrotiri. The boxes of the Aegean dual chariot might be added to emphasize the same point. Apropos of recent work on hoplite warfare, it would be interesting to have some sense of the actual weight and balance of the Aegean body shields, perhaps through experimental work. The typological discussion is also com- prehensive, discussing the symmetry/asymmetry and structural relationship (touching, not touching, inter- secting) of the two lobes, the presence of the telamon, and the details of stitching. The morphological varia- tion, perhaps not surprisingly, seems to be related largely to the constraints of the different artistic media. The chronological analysis establishes the diachronic range and the contexts in which the figure-of-eight shield motif occurs within each material. Questions relating to the symbolic significance of the figure-of-eight shield motif are raised in the final chap- 2000] 799</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS ter. The views of numerous scholars are presented and there are useful ideas and insights. For example, the discussion of the forms and contexts of pottery bearing the figure-of-eight shield motif convincing demonstrates that the motif is not simply "decorative" but has a contex- tually meaningful symbolic dimension; similarly the prob- able relationship between bull games, sacrifice, and the finished shield is highlighted. As a whole, however, the discussion suffers from the lack of any consistent frame- work for "reading" iconography. The discussion comprises four categories: palladia, cult objects, shields in processional contexts, and symbolic use (in association with other symbols). Given the com- plexity of Aegean iconography, it is not at all clear that such categories are useful. Some images incorporate the shield with the head, arms, and sometimes feet of an anthropomorphic form, in other words, the palladion. The interesting suggestion is made that short, horizon- tal strokes either side of the shield's "waist" might be understood as arms and therefore belong with this group. The loops and rosettes at the top of the shield are tak- en to be stylized heads, whereas other scholars see them as a means of hanging the shield. The "palladion" imag- es are accepted as relating to a goddess of war, who is also considered to have protective qualities and to be related to the domain of fertility and the regeneration of nature. The wider symbolism of the shield is also interpreted as referring to this goddess; for example, a sacerdotal role in the service of a "goddess of war" is attributed to the female burial with gold rings bearing shields from Archanes. The larger problems of defining and thinking about female divinity in the Bronze Age are presumably con- sidered beyond the scope of the study but should not be ignored. The association of goddesses with the realm of warfare in Mycenaean iconography, and especially at Mycenae, seems largely unproblematic (see most re- cently P. Rehak, "The Mycenaean 'Warrior Goddess' Revisited," in Polemos, edited by R. Laffineur, 227-37 [Liege 1999]). The same cannot easily be argued for the much more ambiguous and complicated imagery from Crete. The concentration of shield imagery at Knossos is also striking and needs to be considered in relation to the special Knossian use of bull imagery. Marinatos's analyses of sets of symbols (shield, bucra- nium, garment impaled triangle) as symbols for hunt- ing and sacrifice deserved fuller discussion, as does consideration of the potential for images to be polyse- mic and metaphoric. This is a useful study of a distinctively Aegean artifact type, although the full significance of the figure-of- eight shield still remains in part enigmatic. The book will be primarily of relevance to Aegean prehistorians, and also of interest to Homerists and to specialists in martial matters. CHRISTINE MORRIS DEPARTMENT OF CLASSICS TRINITY COLLEGE DUBLIN DUBLIN 2 IRELAND CMORRIS@TCD.IE ANCIENT ANATOLIA: FIFTY YEARS' WORK BY THE BRITISH INSTITUTE OF ARCHAEOLOGY AT ANKARA, edited by Roger Matthews. Pp. xx + 378, figs. 148, color pls. 56. British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara, London 1998. $54. ISBN 1-898249-11-3 (cloth). This is a wonderful book, rich with scientific informa- tion as well as reminiscences about the aims and results achieved by the British Institute of Archaeology at Anka- ra (BIAA) during its first 50 years. Inaugurated in 1948 in Ankara, the first of the foreign research institutes to open in the capital of the Turkish Republic instead of in Istanbul, the BIAA has taken advantage of its central location and pursued projects in all corners of the coun- try. The contributors comprise a distinguished list of re- searchers, including the editor, Roger Matthews, the current Director of the BIAA. Much regretted, however, is the self-imposed absence of David French, Director from 1968 to 1993, whose great knowledge of the topog- raphy, archaeology, and history of Turkey has been fun- damental to the achievements of the BIAA. The list of contributors reveals an additional absence: only one of the 27 authors is a woman, an indication of how much the BIAA has been a masculine preserve. Turkish women archaeologists, in contrast, have been directing field projects for decades. Research sponsored by the BIAA has taken on its own distinctive character. Its most influential work has been in the revealing of Neolithic settlements, in making clear the value of the surface survey and the multidisciplinary approach to archaeological field research, and in explor- ing Roman and Byzantine provincial art and archaeology. In contrast with other research institutions, both Turkish and foreign, the BIAA never settled down for long-term excavations at a large Bronze Age or Classical site. In- stead, with the one exception of Gatal H6yuik, the BIAA has preferred short-term explorations at a variety of sites and has long promoted the surface survey as a worthy scientific endeavor. Catal Ho6yik has been the most spectacular site exca- vated under the auspices of the BIAA. With Mellaart's excavations first at Hacilar, then at (atal H6yuk, the Neolithic past of Turkey came dramatically to light. Mel- laart writes here about his pioneering work at these two sites and at Beycesultan. I. Hodder and R. Matthews con- tinue the story from 1993, when excavations resumed after a hiatus of nearly 30 years. Other scholars have done research in the Palaeolithic and Neolithic: T. Wat- kins's excavations at Pinarbasi in the Konya Plain have documented a predecessor and neighbor of Catal H6yiuk; I. Todd's Central Anatolian Survey of 1964-1966 brought Asikli H6yik to scholarly attention (under excavation since 1989 by Istanbul University's Ufuk Esin); and A. Garrard's 1995-1996 survey between Maras and Gaziantep has located many early prehistoric sites. Although an aim of the BIAA's founder,John Garstang, was to promote research on the Hittites, the best-known British contributions to Hittitology have come not in archaeology but in philology and epigraphy, with the work of O. Gurney andJ. D. Hawkins. Yet archaeological re- 800 [AJA 104</page></plain_text>
