<plain_text><page sequence="1">Psychology in the Curriculum Sir,?May I be allowed to reply to some of the points raised by Dr. J. S. Manson and Professor Major Greenwood in your issue of September 9th? If I do not seek to retaliate in the customary vein of controversial irony it is because I do not wish the important issue to be side tracked through needless personal justification. I have already agreed with Dr. Manson's contention that the physiological and biological approaches to psycho logy have afforded us valuable insight into certain aspects of reaction and behaviour, and I see no reason why this new knowledge should not be taught as belonging to the respective provinces of physiology and biology. But these</page><page sequence="2">71&amp; Oct. 14r 1933] CORRESPONDENCE x theBr LMedtcal Journal aspects, interesting though they are, do not cover the essential field of psychology of which Professor Greenwood and myself feel the lack in medical education?namely the study of " the historical development and the essential nature of the soul (tt?? t/ ^*)." The objective study of the psyche began, as Professor Greenwood rightly points out, with the Greek scientist philosophers, but the need to objectify the unconscious? that is, that province of the mind where fate rules?has prevailed ever since the dawn of culture. The need to project the complex psychology of the unconscious created the constellations of astrology many centuries before the dawn of astronomy as an objective science, just as the projection of unconscious contents in the forms of myth, ritual, and demonology preceded an objective, scientific interest in natural phenomena. The disciplined empiricism of natural science has gained for us a relatively firm detachment from the theriomorphic and anthropomorphic projections of which, in former times, man's relation with the universe consisted ; but it has not yet achieved an adequate empirical account of the complex psychic functions and processes from which these world-creating and destroying projections arose. That this hinterland of the mind is both a bogy and a seduction to the rational mind is illustrated by Dr. Manson, who seems to cling to the hope that the psyche may be, after all, no more than what the biologists and physiologists assert?namely, a rather complicated system of conditioned reflexes ; only that and nothing more. For if we were to admit that the psyche had an existence in and for itself, demanding conceptions that are commen- j surate with its historical and actual significance, then " Heaven help medicine! It would be led into a morass I of mysticism, where it would flounder in confusion." I raised the issue because I believed that medical science has now reached the point where it is fitted to take up the study of the " essential nature of the soul," with a psychological technique of the unconscious and a trained empiricism which antique culture did not possess. This study is still in its infancy, and if students are taught what purports to be a science of the mind, but actually is no more than an extension of physiology and biology into the realm of human behaviour, their interest in a real psychology will be usurped by a surrogate. The situation is urgent, as the plan for pre-clinical as well as clinical courses in psychology is actually being considered. My suggestion of the open seminar method was to provide an avenue in teaching hospitals where some instruction in practical psychological research and some discussion of clinical problems could be provided, without the danger?which in my opinion is formidable?of giving the student the notion that attendance at a course of lectures is an adequate equipment for psychological prac tice. No man is fitted, in my opinion, to undertake the treatment of the sick by psychological means who has not himself submitted to deep analysis, and even then the less he thinks he knows the better.?I am, etc., London, N.W.I, Sept, 27th.
