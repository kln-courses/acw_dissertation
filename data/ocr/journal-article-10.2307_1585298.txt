<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHORT NOTES MN QDM: DEFERENTIAL TREATMENT IN BIBLICAL ARAMAIC AND THE QUMRAN TARGUM OF JOB?* Having apparently been given access to the MS of 1 QarJob prior to the publication of the Editio Princeps, E.W. Tuinstra, a Dutch doc- toral student in Groningen, was the first to suggest that the Aramaic translator's use of [mn] qdmwhy, "from before him", as a rendering of Hebrew msdy, "from Shadday" (Job xxvii 13), paralleled the use of qdm in the later Rabbinic targumim.i Both he and his doctoral promotor B. Jongeling saw this parallel usage as reflecting a shared concern on the part of the translators to provide a type of 'buffer' when charac- terising relations between the deity and humans.2 While Tuinstra drew on G.F. Moore's work in his assessment of this 'targumic usage', the publication in the late seventies of M.L. Klein's important work on targumic translation of anthropomorphisms and anthropopathisms pro- vided a much needed corrective to an over-generalised perception of the phenomenon.3 With respect to the preposition qdm, Klein discov- ered that its use in the Aramaic targumim in place of the Hebrew nota accusativi or other more direct prepositions is paralleled by the usage attested in the Aramaic of Daniel (DA).4 Furthermore, Klein noted that this common usage is not limited to divine contexts, but rather occurs as both an expression of deference to a respectable person or institution, and as a natural result of the idiomatic variance between biblical Hebrew and Targumic Aramaic.5 While Klein's study of the 'targumic' use of qdm did not include 1lQarJob, B.E. Zuckerman's study of the Qumran text one year later does make reference to the use of qdm in Daniel but comes to the conclusion that its use in the Qumran text does not reflect 'circumlocutory intent' (i.e. buffering) but is simply part of the literary Aramaic used by the translator.6 Zuckerman's grounds for contesting the interpretation of qdm as a 'buffer' are: a) Where this same compound expression mn qdm appears elsewhere in the Qumran text (1 IQarJob XXVI 3-4) it is apparently a rendering of the Hebrew preposition mn (m-zrw') in MT xxxv 9b ysw'w mzrw' rbym (i.e., a context which does not suggest a need for deferential language). b) Although there is evidence in DA for the use of qdm as a 'buffer' we also find in DA two cases in which this preposition is used in contexts where deference would not normally be presumed (i.e., Dan. iv 4: Nebuchadnezzar reveals his dream before his magicians; iv 5b: Nebuchadnezzar says his dream before Daniel).7 ?

A survey of the occurrences of mn qdm in BA finds that this compound preposition appears in texts describing both divine-human (Dan. ii 18, v 24) and human-human (Dan. ii 6, ii 15, v 19, Ezr. vii 14) rela- tionships where a hierarchical distinction is being drawn between one member of the relationship as inferior to the other in terms of influence, power or position.9 In fact the usage of the compound preposition in both contexts is illustrated in the space of half a verse at Dan. vi 27a: "I (the King) make a decree (lit. a decree is issuedfrom before me [mn- qdmy], that in all my royal dominion people should tremble and fear before (lit. from before [mn-qdm]) the God of Daniel." In addition, this compound preposition also appears three times within the vision sequence in chapter seven of Daniel. First, in verse 10, a stream of fire flows out 'from before him (the Ancient of Days)' [mn-qdmwhy]. Similarly, in Daniel's vision (v. 8) and then again in its recitation (v. 20), the three horns of the fourth great beast are uprooted 'from before it (the "little" horn)' [mn qdmyh]. The vision's subsequent interpretation (v. 24) makes it clear that the horns signify rival kings which are subdued (spl) by a newly arisen king whose only apparent superiority lies in its power to dislodge his predecessors. What light does DA usage of this expression shed on the Qumran text's use of it? While the Hebrew of Job xxxv 9b ysw'w mzrw' rbym may be rendered in English with a causal (i.e., "they cry out (from/ because) of the arm of the mighty") the formally divergent Aramaic translation found in 1 Ql0 yswhwn mn qdm sgy'yn must clearly be ren- dered "they call out from before (the) numerous/mighty".'? Whether the subjects are understood as crying out from before "the numerous" or (as is more likely) "the mighty", the first portion of the verse (Job xxxv 9a "Because they are terribly oppressed, they [the people] cry out...") makes it clear that the Hebrew poet is describing a situation of oppres- sion and subordination. It is suggested that the use of the compound preposition here in 11Q10 seems to correspond to the usage already illustrated in DA at vii 8 and 20, where the expression mn qdm is used 402</page><page sequence="3">SHORT NOTES to grammatically mark a superior-inferior relationship. Both in BA and in 11QarJob, the superior-inferior distinction operates not at the level of 'deity-mortal', nor at the level of 'king-subject' but rather at the more general level of'powerful-weak'. Finally, turning to Job xxvii 13, we see that this passage describes the visitation of divine retribution on the guilty man ("This is the sinner's lot from God, the portion which oppressors receive from the Almighty") and furthermore, we observe that 11QarJob's translation of Hebrew msdyyqhw, "from Shadday they receive", with [mn] qdmwhy ynswn, "from before him they [the oppressors] carry away", provides a general parallel to the second appearance of mn qdm in Dan. vi 27a where, as we have seen, the superior-inferior distinction is that of the deity-mortal relationship." In conclusion, it is suggested that the use of mn qdm is not limited to a 'buffering' or deferential treatment of divine-human or monarch- subject relations in either BA or the Aramaic utilised by the Qumran translator ofJob.'2 Rather, the compound preposition appears in both texts as an idiomatic Aramaic expression of hierarchical relationships in which one member is inferior to the other in terms of influence, power or position.

For comparison purposes, the exclu- sion of the first preposition also constitutes a reconstruction and in light of the MT here (mn) and 1 Q10's rendering of the Hebrew at xxxv 9, the less likely of the two. 9 For a particularly useful analytical compilation of the occurrences of qdm in BH and BA see A. Evan-Shoshan, New Concordance to the Torah, Prophets and Writings, Vol. 3 [Heb.] (Jerusalem, 1977-80), p. 1001; F. Rosenthal, A Grammar of Biblical Aramaic (Wiesbaden, 1961), p. 37, provides a broadly accurate, if insufficiently refined charac- terisation of qdm (with or without prefix) in BA as "a less direct, respectful indication of location". The compound preposition (mn qdmh) also occurs with a temporal mean- ing (e.g., Dan. vi 11, vii 24; Ezr. v. 11). '0 M. Sokoloff, p. 79, also translates the Aramaic as 'from before'. While the Ara- maic term sgy'yn may indicate magnitude of quantity ('many') or quality ('great') (see M. Jastrow, A Dictionary of the Targumim ... (Jerusalem, 1926), p. 954) the Hebrew which it apparently translates here should probably be understood as intending the latter (R. Gordis, The Book of Job. Commentary, New Translation and Special Studies (New York, 1978), p. 401). In addition, the Rabbinic targum of Job (D. Stec, The Text of the Targum ofJob [Leiden, 1994]) has also understood the Hebrew in this manner, providing dwrbny' 'haughty leaders' (variant rbrbny' 'great men, princes' [preferable?]). ' While Job xx 29 closely parallels xxvii 13 in its use of this same preposition before a divine name, 11 QarJob's rendering has unfortunately not been preserved. Both P-Job and RtgJob supply mn qdm in place of Hebrew m- before their renderings of 'lhym in v. 29a but reproduce the Aramaic cognate of the simple Hebrew preposition before 'I in v. 29b. Some MSS of RtgJob (see D. Stec above) provide qdm again in v. 29b but the majority do not. 12 RtgJob's rendering here (m'm sdy yqblwn) signals that the targumic translator too has felt the need for the use of a compound preposition (albeit of a different combi- nation) in his attempt to provide an acceptable Aramaic translation of the Hebrew. Although the Syriac translator (Vetus Testamentum Syriace: Job (ed. G. Rignell) Part II, fasicle 1 a [Leiden, 1982]) apparently does not feel the need to provide an additional element in his rendering of v. 13b (mn hsyn' nqblwn) a semantically related compound preposition does appear in the preceding half of the verse xxvii 13a (br 'ns' rsy" mn Iwt 'Ih'). Interestingly in the case of v. 13a, two Peshitta MSS (8al, lcl) provide mn qdm in place of the reading (mn Iwt) attested in 7al and the remaining witnesses.</page></plain_text>
