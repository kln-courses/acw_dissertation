<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vetus Testamentum XXXVIII, 1 (1988) AN EXAMINATION OF SOME ATTEMPTS TO DEFEND THE UNITY OF THE FLOOD NARRATIVE IN GENESIS PART II by J. A. EMERTON Cambridge In Part I of this article, VT 37 (1987), pp. 401-20, I discussed the attempts of U. Cassuto and E. Nielsen to defend the unity of the flood story in Genesis against those who believe that it has arisen as the combination by a redactor of two sources, J and P, and I did not find either of the defences to be convincing. We now turn to the attempts of some other scholars to defend the unity of the narrative. (3) F. I. Andersen F. I. Andersen's criticisms of the source analysis of the flood story are made in his book The Sentence in Biblical Hebrew (The Hague and Paris, 1974). As its title implies, this is not a book about the source analysis of Genesis, but about a topic in Hebrew gram- mar, to the study of which, indeed, it makes a valuable contribu- tion. Andersen refers, however, to source analysis in two chapters, and claims that his own study of the sentence in Hebrew casts doubt on theories of the use of material from two sources. In both chapters he explicitly mentions the flood story. I Andersen's first criticisms of the widely-accepted analysis of the flood story into sources come on pp. 39-40 and 59, n. 1, in chapter 3, "Apposition Sentences", in the section 3.4, "Epic repetition in apposition". By an "apposition sentence" he means "two or more clauses in juxtaposition (no conjunction)" (p. 36), and in epic repetition "the same (or very similar) semantic content is expressed</page><page sequence="2">J. A. EMERTON twice in two items in apposition", and "similar grammatical elements are characteristically placed in a chiasmus" (p. 39). Andersen claims that the recognition of this stylistic device can satisfactorily account for some repetitions that source-critics seek to explain as the result of the combination of two sources. Further, "Sentences from the Flood Epic used in the present chapter cut across passages generally assigned to the 'J' and 'P' documents. The same is true of the chiastic coordination to be described in Chapter 9. This means that if the documentary hypothesis is valid, some editor has put together scraps of parallel versions of the same story with scissors and paste, and yet has achieved a result which, from the point of view of discourse grammar, looks as if it has been made out of whole cloth" (p. 40). Which sentences used in chapter 3 of Andersen's book "cut across" J and P passages? Andersen is scarcely referring to the fact that some of his examples come from J and some from P, and he presumably has in mind any example of a sentence ascribed to one source that is in apposition to a sentence ascribed to another source. Most of the examples given by him do not meet this condition: for example, the apposition sentences that he quotes from vii 1-4, 7-8 belong to J, and those from vi 17, 19-20, viii 16-17, 18-19 belong to P. The only exception in section 3.4.1 is vii 21-2 (pp. 39-40), of which verse 21 is ascribed to P and verse 22 to J. In addition, he notes "the chiasmus within each apposition sentence" and "also some chiasmus between prediction [i.e. in vi 17 P] and fulfilment" (p. 40). The chiasmus within vii 21-2 is unimpressive, for it consists only of a verb at the beginning of the first verse and at the end of the second and the fact that the first element of each subject begins with kl. It is not difficult to imagine a redactor combining material from two sources in such a way that verse 22 is not introduced by a conjunction, and a minimal chiasmus involving only the verbs and their subjects appears. Moreover, there is a difficulty in the chiasmus, in which the verbs wayyigwac and metu are presumably A and A , and the subjects introduced by kol- and kol are B and B. But verse 21 twice has 'al-ha)dres, and to it corresponds behdrdbd in verse 22, and the correspondence can scarcely be disregarded by someone who thinks that the verses were intended to be chiastic. If, however, these words are C and C, then the order is ABC:B C A, which spoils the chiasmus. Andersen's further claim that there is "some chiasmus" between prediction and fulfilment does not 2</page><page sequence="3">AN EXAMINATION OF THE FLOOD NARRATIVE IN GENESIS amount to much, for it is scarcely surprising if vi 17 P ends with the verb gwC and vii 21 P begin with it. The only other example in chapter 3 involving both J and P is found on p. 41, which speaks of "four references to the date" in Gen. vii 10J, 1 la and llb P. Once again, it is difficult to see any implausibility in supposing that a redactor combined different references to the date from two different sources, but did not use a conjunction between the part from J and the part from P. II Reference has already been made to Andersen's use of chiasmus as evidence against source analysis, and chapter 9 is called "Chiastic sentences". The first passage relevant to his criticism of the source analysis of the flood story is found on pp. 123-6. He discusses chiasmus in Gen. vii 6-17, and sets out the evidence in the form of a diagram on p. 125. No one is likely to question that chiasmus is present in Gen. vi 11: nibqec' kol-ma!yenot tehom rabbd wa'arubbot has'samayim niptdhu, in which there is a clear AB: B A pattern. The verse is ascribed to P, but verses 10 and 12 toJ, and Andersen finds another chiasmus in these verses too: 10 ume hammabbul hdyu 'al-had dres- 12 wayeh haggesem Cal-ha)dres. This chiasmus involves only the position of the verbs and their subjects and is not complete: ABC: BA C . He thus claims that vii 10-12 contains a chiasmus (verse 11) "sandwiched into another chiastic sentence" (verses 10 and 12, p. 124). There would, it may be noted, be nothing surprising about a redactor inserting a chiasmus from P into a chiasmus from J, for this would have been the natural place to dovetail material from two sources-indeed, where else could he have put verse 11?-and Andersen's own statement that "verse 12 does not continue verse 11" (p. 124) is scarcely incompatible with source analysis. We shall now consider Andersen's understanding of the structure of Gen. vi 6-17 as a whole as a series of chiastic sentences. In his diagram, importance is attached to whether the subject comes before or after the verb, and the subjects considered are different expressions for the flood waters on the one hand, and human and animal passengers in the ark on the other: Verse 6 (water + verb) corresponds to verse 17 (verb + water). Verse 7 (verb + human passengers) corresponds to verses 8-9 (animal passengers + verb). 3</page><page sequence="4">J. A. EMERTON Verse 10 (water + verb) corresponds to verse 12 (verb + water). Verse lla (verb + water) corresponds to verse lib (water + verb) (on the relation of verse 11 to verses 10 and 12 see above, p. 3). Verse 13 (verb + human passengers) corresponds to verses 14-15 (animal passengers + verb), and also to verse 16a (animal passengers + verb), which is linked to verse 15 by a conjunction. Andersen also notes that there are references to time early in verses 6, 10, 11, 13 (though it is not clear what relevance they have to his understanding of the chiastic pattern), and that the themes of the sections alternate: flood (6), entry (7-9), flood (10-12), entry (13- 16a), and flood (17). Further, he notes how different events have two aspects. The first was noted above: human passengers are mentioned in 7 and 13, but animal passengers in 8-9, 14-15, 16a. The alternation in order of verb and subject in verses 7-9 and 13-16 is balanced by an alternation in the type of passenger (except that animal passengers + verb appear in both 14-15 and 16a). Similarly, Anderson claims, there "are two causes of the flood-the eruption of ocean waters...and the massive downpour" (p. 126), the former in verses 6, 10, la, 17, and the latter in verses lb, 12. These distinctions contribute to the pattern in his diagram. At first sight, Andersen's diagram looks impressive, especially when seen in connexion with his comments, and it might appear that there is a good case for attributing vii 6-17 to a literary artist, rather than to a redactor combining material from two sources. On closer examination, however, there are difficulties. That is not to say that there are no examples of intentional chiasmus (and vii 11, at least, must be regarded as one). Nor need all literary skill be denied to a redactor. Nevertheless, Andersen's pattern is less impressive when examined critically. First, there is the question of demarcation. Why does Andersen stop at vii 17? That verse speaks of the increase of the waters, and the following verses do the same. If verses 18 ff. are a continuation of verse 17 (and Andersen makes a point of dealing with the text as it now is), then the addition of a passage at the end of the section that he is discussing spoils the balance of his pattern. Secondly, the neatness and clarity of his pattern arise from his selection of certain types of word as significant: particular verbs and their position in the sentence, and words for passengers or water as 4</page><page sequence="5">AN EXAMINATION OF THE FLOOD NARRATIVE IN GENESIS the subjects. Is it certain that the words he has selected are signifi- cant, and that others can be ignored for the purpose? He makes some reference to indications of time, but they do not appear to contribute anything to the pattern, except that they come at or near the beginnings of verses. The examples that he has chosen relate to the time when something happened. Verses 12 and 17 contain references to the duration of the flood, and only the latter comes near the beginning of the verse. Why are they ignored? In Andersen's diagram, the verb in verse 10 is said to come after the subject, but Andersen overlooks the fact that wayehz is the first word in the verse. The diagram also shows verse 16b, "The LORD shut the door", but does not explain what place it has in the structure-and it is difficult to see what that place might be. Thirdly, although the appearance of alternating themes of flood and entry into the ark looks impressive in a diagram, they by-pass the question why people and animals enter twice. How can Andersen's hypothesis deal with the problem? Is not the repetition well explained on the hypothesis of the combination of two sources? Fourthly, the theory that certain events have "two aspects" is weaker than may appear at first sight. It is true that human and animal passengers are distinguished, but what that amounts to is saying that in both vii 7-9 and 13-16, the two passages that describe the entry into the ark, human beings are mentioned before animals, and that the narrator (or narrators) varied the position of the verb. The pattern based on "two causes of the flood", rain in vii 11 and 12 and "the eruption of ocean waters" in vii 6, 10, la and 17, seems to rest on a misunderstanding of the text. It is true that vii 1l a refers to waters coming up from the deep below and swelling the flood-and this understanding of part of the cause of the flood is usually attributed to P here and in viii 2. But there is no reason to suppose that exclusively the same event is meant by vii 6 (hammabbul...mayim),10 (me hammabbit), and 17 (hammabbil). mabbul is a general word for the flood (used by both J and P), as is plain from vi 17, ix 11, 15, 28, x 1, 32, xi 10. The mabbul may have been thought to have been caused by rain () or by both rain and the bursting forth of the subterranean waters (P), but it is not to be identified with the waters from beneath. The passages cited by Andersen and given a place in his chiastic pattern do not prove his point. Thus, despite the value of Andersen's contribution to the study 5</page><page sequence="6">J. A. EMERTON of the Hebrew sentence, he has not succeeded in weakening the theory that the flood story has been composed of two sources. (4) G. J. Wenham G. J. Wenham, "The coherence of the flood narrative", VT 28 (1978), pp. 336-48, offers three main "arguments for supposing that Genesis vi-ix is a carefully composed piece of literature, which is more coherent than usually admitted" (p. 337). While he does not maintain that his arguments exclude the possibility that the writer combined material from two sources, he finds it "a simpler and more economical hypothesis" to think "of one epic source which has been reworked by a later priestly editor" (p. 348). Further, various comments make it plain that he does not view with favour the theory that the present narrative is the result of the combination by a redactor of material from J and P. I The principal point in Wenham's first argument is that Gen. vi 10-ix 19 contains a palistrophe hinged on viii 1 (p. 338): Genesis vi 10-ix 19 A Noah (vi 1Oa) B Shem, Ham and Japheth (10b) C Ark to be built (14-16) D Flood announced (17) E Covenant with Noah (18-20) F Food in the ark (21) G Command to enter ark (vii 1-3) H 7 days waiting for flood (4-5) I 7 days waiting for flood (7-10) J Entry to ark (11-15) K Yahweh shuts Noah in (16) L 40 days flood (17a) M Waters increase (17b-18) N Mountains covered (19-20) O 150 days waters prevail ((21)-24) P GOD REMEMBERS NOAH 0 150 days waters abate (3) N Mountain tops visible (4-5) M Waters abate (5) 6</page><page sequence="7">AN EXAMINATION OF THE FLOOD NARRATIVE IN GENESIS L 40 days (end of) (6a) K Noah opens window of ark (6b) J Raven and dove leave ark (7-9) I 7 days waiting for waters to subside (10-11) H 7 days waiting for waters to subside (12-13) G Command to leave ark (15-17(22)) F Food outside ark (ix 1-4) E Covenant with all flesh (8-10) D No flood in future (11-17) C Ark (18a) B Shem, Ham and Japheth (18b) A Noah (19) Before viii 1 are fifteen items, A-O, which are balanced by fifteen items in the reverse order after viii 1, O -A . He admits that up "to a point it is not surprising to find one [sc. a palistrophe] in the flood story" (pp. 337-8), since some events happen in the reverse order after the flood (e.g. entering and leaving the ark, and the rise and fall of the flood waters), but argues that there is an element of contrivance in some of the items. Thus, the events recorded in F -A (ix 9-19) do not naturally correspond in order to A-F (vi 10-21); items H and I refer to the same period of seven days, whereas H and I refer to two different periods, and the forty days of L (vii 17) are part of the hundred and fifty days of vii 24. This contrivance shows that an attempt has been made to arrange items in a special order even when the counterparts do not naturally match. Further, he admits that there are some things in the narrative that have no place in the palistrophic pattern, such as Noah's sacrifice in viii 20 ff. (p. 340). Such items are explicable because the author was dependent on traditions which he did not feel free to change or omit, and because he wanted variety, for "Absolute repetitiveness is dull" (p. 340). Thus, Wenham claims repetition as evidence for his theory, but does not recognize lack of repetition as evidence against it. Is he trying to have it both ways? Before we examine Wenham's arguments in detail, it may be noted that, even at their face value, some of the elements in his pattern are compatible with an analysis into J and P sources, as he perhaps recognizes in his remarks on pp. 347-8 (see above). In addition to the fact (which he also recognizes) that the order of some events is natural, it may be observed that some corresponding pairs in the palistrophe come from the same source. Thus, K, L and part 7</page><page sequence="8">J. A. EMERTON of M and their counterparts are found in J; and D, E, F and parts of H and M and their counterparts belong to P. The force of Wenham's argument lies, however, in the cumulative weight of evidence found in both sources and in places where the correspond- ing elements are usually ascribed to different sources. Now it is possible to consider some comments on his theory. First, the length of the units varies considerably between about half a verse and several verses. If the writer had been as interested in symmetry as Wenham supposes, one might have expected his interest to extend to an effort to achieve at least approximate symmetry in the length of the significant items in his list. Secondly, the choice of some items in the list seems arbitrary. Noah is mentioned many times in the narrative. How can we be sure that the mention of his name in A (vi lOa) and A (ix 19) is significant, but not that in, for example, ix 18 between D and C ? Wenham might reply that at least Noah is mentioned at the begin- ning and end of the unit he is discussing, and the fact is not altered by the observation that the mention in such positions is not unnatural or surprising. More seriously, why is the mention of Ham, Shem and Japheth thought significant in vi lOb (B) and ix 18b (B), but not in vii 13, the only other place in the alleged palistrophe where the names appear? Similarly, the ark is mentioned many times in the story, but why are only the references in vi 14-16 (C) and ix 18a (C) significant? It may be noted that the presence of C in the series E , D , C, B is regarded as important by Wenham on p. 339. Again, forty days are apparently significant for Wenham in vii 17a (L) and viii 6a (L ), but not in vii 12. Like- wise, item J in vii' 11-15 records the entry into the ark, and J , viii 7-9 that the raven and the dove leave the ark, but Wenham ignores viii 18-19, where Noah leaves with his family and the animals, despite the fact that that passage seems a more appropriate counter- part to vii 11-15. Nor does he mention the entry into the ark in vii 7-9 (and he is presumably not one of those who regard the passage as due, in whole or part, to a redactor). If Wenham's selection of some items in his list is thus arbitrary, the force of the argument for a palistrophe is considerably weakened. Thirdly, there are some pairs of items in the palistrophe whose correspondence to each other is questionable. It was seen in the previous paragraph that the pairing of J and J is a mistake. It may also be doubted how closely K, vii 16 in which God shuts Noah in 8</page><page sequence="9">AN EXAMINATION OF THE FLOOD NARRATIVE IN GENESIS the ark, corresponds to K , viii 6b in which Noah, not God, opens a window in the ark. Fourthly, it may be doubted whether some items in Wenham's list are distinct from one another. H (vii 4-5) and I (vii 7-10) refer to the same period of seven days, whereas the periods of seven days in I (viii 10-11) and H (viii 12-13) are distinct. Wenham recognizes the fact on p. 339 and, as we have seen, regards it as evidence that the palistrophe is contrived and therefore intentional. Is it not more likely that the separation into two items by Wenham is contrived, and that the number of his alleged correspondences should be reduced by one? Similarly, we have seen that it is unsatisfactory to treat K as the counterpart to K. Fifthly, there are some things in the story that do not have a significant place in the palistrophe. Wenham himself recognizes this for the account of Noah's sacrifice in viii 20 ff., as we have seen. Its lack of a counterpart is understandable, for this act of thanksgiving necessarily came after the end of the flood. Similarly, it was doubtless not easy to find a counterpart to the important statement in vii 21-3 that every living being died apart from those in the ark. Wenham also makes the point that the writer was bound by tradition. If, however, that writer was as skilful and ingenious, and so concerned to compose a palistrophe, as Wenham believes, it is surprising that he did not find a place for some other important events in his list of significant points in the story. The force of the argument is not turned by asserting that, "if he had achieved total and perfect symmetry, the story might have lost some of its interest" (p. 340). The fact that some important items are not fitted into Wenham's pattern cannot but cast doubt on his theory. Chronology seems to have been an important subject for the writer, and I noted above that Wenham gives a place in the palistrophe to the references to forty days in vii 17a (L) and viii 6a (L ), but not to vii 12. There I was asking why L and L had been included in the palistrophe; here I ask about an omission. If the references to forty days were thought important enough to be included in the palistrophe in vii 17a and viii 6a, why does the reference in vii 12 (cp. vii 4) have no place in the pattern? Similarly, we might have expected to find in the pattern the references to Noah's age that appear in vii 6 (between H and I), 11 (between I and J), and viii 13 (within H ), and the dating in viii 5 (after M but within N- and, incidentally, the overlap of N and M casts doubt on 9</page><page sequence="10">J. A. EMERTON Wenham's pattern at this point). The writer allegedly wishing to produce a palistrophe could surely have placed these references to chronology in appropriate places in his pattern, and tradition would surely not have prevented him from adding further chronological references to balance them if necessary. Further, there are a number of places in the narrative where one passage clearly corresponds to another. A palistrophe consists of a series of corresponding passages and, if the writer intended a palistrophe, we expect clear examples of such correspondence to appear in it (and not to obscure the palistrophe by their irrelevance to it). But there are some corresponding passages that do not have a place in the alleged pattern, and their existence casts doubt on whether a palistrophe was intended. We have already seen that Wenham's failure to find a place in the palistrophe for the entry into the ark in vii 7-9 and the departure from it in viii 18-19 causes a difficulty for his pattern. It also leads one to ask why the author did not fit these corresponding verses into his alleged pattern. Equally striking is the failure to include vii 11 (between H and I), which narrates that the springs of the deep and the windows of heaven were opened, and viii 2 (between P and O ), which records that they were closed again and obviously matches the earlier verse. Further, yeser leb haddddm raC in viii 21 echoes wekol-yeser mahsebot libbo [sc. of hdadddm] raq rac in vi 5, but vi 5 is not in the part of the narrative in which Wenham claims to find a palistrophe, and that raises the question whether it is right to suppose that vi 10 is the place where a unit of the story begins. The weaknesses in Wenham's case make the theory of a palistrophe in vi 10-ix 19 dubious. It is far from being a strong argument against the analysis of the flood story into sources. The same section of Wenham's article discusses the introductory paragraphs of the flood story. vi 5-7 is thought by him to be "a loose form of panel writing, that is, certain key words are repeated in a fixed order" (p. 340), and the same is said to be true of viii 21. Since, however, both are usually ascribed to the J source, Wenham's observation at best draws attention to a literary device used by J, and it is valueless as an argument against source analysis. vi 8-9 is different in that respect, in that verse 8 is usually attributed to J and verse 9 to P. Wenham believes that a paragraph begins with vi 8, and also claims to find a chiasmus in the two verses. It is possible, however, that the alleged chiasmus is merely 10</page><page sequence="11">AN EXAMINATION OF THE FLOOD NARRATIVE IN GENESIS accidental. Whatever precisely toledot means in this context, it is by no means certain that it means the same as its supposed counterpart in the chiasmus, namely, dorot later in vi 9: the words "These are the generations of Noah" are a questionable match for "in his generations". Further, we must ask whether there is sufficient reason to think that vi 8 is the beginning of a paragraph, rather than ending what precedes (which would enable verse 8 with Yahweh to be ascribed to J, and verse 9 with Elohim to P). One of Wenham's reasons is his claim that there is a chiasmus that involves both verses, but I have maintained that that is not a conclusive argument here. He also refers (p. 341) to Andersen, pp. 80 ff. Andersen notes on pp. 80-1 that it "is usually supposed that a new paragraph begins at" Gen. vi 9 and, if that is so, that vi 8 is "a circumstantial clause" that is "the close-out of the preceding material to which it is adversative-But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord". That understanding makes sense, and Andersen has no objection to the use of "circumstantial clauses ending an episode or paragraph" and gives other examples on p. 81 (e.g. Gen. xviii 22). But he says that "we must ask" (no more) whether Gen. vi 8 "begins a new paragraph in spite of the traditonal punc- tuation", and he raises the question "in view of" Gen. xxxvii 1-2. In Gen. xxxvii it is verse 2, not verse 1, that begins "These are the generations of (?elleh toledot)', like vi 9. When, however, we look at other examples of e7lleh toledot, we find that normally they come at the beginning of a section: Gen. x 1, xi 10, 27, xxv 12, 19, xxxvi 1, 9; Num. iii 1; Ruth iv 18 (Gen. ii 4 is a well-known crux, which I shall not discuss here; it probably refers to what precedes, but it is clearly in a minority). Indeed, even in Gen. xxxvii the first verse, which says that Jacob dwelt in Canaan, offers a contrast to xxxvi, which tells how Esau and his descendants lived in Edom, and it is possible that xxxvii 1 rounds off the preceding chapter and that xxxvii 2 begins a new section. In any case, Gen. xxxvii 2 is scarcely strong support for the view that a new paragraph begins with Gen. vi 8, rather than with verse 9 as most examples of ?elleh toleot suggest. II Wenham's second type of argument concerns the coherence of the chronology in the flood story (pp. 342-5). 11</page><page sequence="12">J. A. EMERTON First, he discusses vi 11-22 and vii 1-5. The reason is presumably that the two passages have been regarded as doublets, and that there has been thought to be a discrepancy between vi 19, which speaks of two of every living thing being brought into the ark, and vii 2-3, which speaks of seven pairs of clean animals and one pair of unclean. According to Wenham, vi 11-22 tells Noah of God's plan to destroy the earth and commands him (in the imperative) to build an ark and to stock it with food. "In passing he is told (in the indicative) that, when the flood comes, he and his family will board the ark, and he will bring pairs of animals with him to preserve life on the earth (vi 18-20)" (p. 342). vii 1-5, however, "deals with the situation after the ark is built... Whereas in the previous paragraph this was simply a statement about the distant future after the ark had been built, now a precise command is given: he must bring in seven pairs of clean animals and one pair of each kind of unclean animals" (p. 342). Three comments may be made. First, even if Wenham is correct in his interpretation of the verbs, there remains a certain repetition, which must be compared with other doublets in the narrative (e.g. vii 7-8 and 13-14, vii 17 and 18-20, viii 2 and 13-14, viii 21-2 and ix 9-11). Second, Wenham has not removed the discrepancy over the number of animals and the distinction between those that are clean and those that are unclean, and the details of the first paragraph seem to be precise like those of the second. Third, it is far from certain that vi 18-20 is not intended to be a command. Obviously, Wenham does not mean to suggest that a verb in the imperfect cannot be used to express a command, for he understands imperfects to be used in that way in vi 14-16, vii 2-3. It is presumably because those imperfects are preceded by imperatives in vi 14, vii 1 that he accepts their use as commands. But vi 18-20 has no imperative, for the verbs in the imperfect are preceded by a consecutive perfect (wahaqizmot), which cannot be understood as a command here (unlike the consecutive perfects in some contexts), and another consecutive perfect (ubdatd) follows it; therefore, he may suppose, vi 18-20 simply states a fact about the future. On the other hand, even if Wenham is right in supposing that the verbs in the second person in vi 18-20 are in the indicative, it does not follow that they merely contain information about the future. In the present context, a statement about what Noah will do (as distinct from what God will do) is scarcely distinguishable from a command about what Noah is to do. Further, as Wenham 12</page><page sequence="13">AN EXAMINATION OF THE FLOOD NARRATIVE IN GENESIS 13 recognizes, verses 14 and 21 contain imperatives, and it follows that the verbs in the imperfect and consecutive perfect in 14-16 (and we dsaptd in 21) are commands to Noah. Is it not natural to under- stand the whole of the section vi 14-21, including 18-20, as God's instructions telling Noah what to do? Secondly, Wenham discusses alleged discrepancies in the chronology, and seeks to overcome them. His principal arguments are that "the writer was not concerned to tell how Noah spent all the time in the ark" (p. 344), and that the period between vii 11 and viii 4 can be reduced to five months if vii 12 and 17 refer to the same period of forty days, and vii 24 and viii 3 to the same period of a hundred and fifty days, and if the hundred and fifty days include the forty days. A hundred and ten days passed between the end of the rain (viii 2), which had lasted forty days, and the ground- ing of the ark on Mount Ararat a hundred and fifty days after the beginning of the flood. The difficulties of such an interpretation were noted in Part I of the present article, pp. 402-5. Thirdly, Wenham follows A. Jaubert in believing that the calen- dar in the flood story has affinities with that of the book of Jubilees, and that the events in the story fall on appropriate days of the week. Since this chronology "embraces the whole story, not just parts of it" (p. 345), it tells in favour of the unity of the story. Jaubert's theory is, however, open to question,1 and a theory based on it is also doubtful. In any case, the evidence advanced by Wenham is of questionable relevance. He claims that, on Jaubert's theory of the chronology, the "flood was announced on a Sunday (vii 4, 10)", and the forty days of rain "ended on Thursday or Friday"; if it was a Friday, then there was a contrast with the creation, which began on a Sunday and ended on a Friday. Similarly, Noah "sent out the birds on Sundays (viii 7, 10, 12)" and, it is suggested, the reason is that he observed the sabbath. The argument that the reader was intended to see an analogy with the creation is not so obvious that great probability can be claimed for it, and the argu- ment about avoiding the sabbath does not amount to more than the fact (if it is a fact) that Noah acted on one of the six days of the week that are not the sabbath.

EMERTON III Wenham's last argument (pp. 345-7) is based on a comparison between the order of events in Genesis and in parallels in the Atrabasis epic, texts from Ras Shamra, Sumerian texts, and, above all, the Gilgamesh epic. Wenham has prepared a list of seventeen items in which the story of Noah in the present text of Genesis has parallels in the other ancient Near Eastern texts, always including Gilgamesh. On the other hand, the parts ascribed to J have by themselves only twelve points in common with Gilgamesh, and P has by itself only ten. Wenham comments: "It is strange that two accounts of the flood so diferent as J and P...should have been combined to give our present story which has many more resemblances to the Gilgamesh version than the postulated sources" (p. 347). He allows the possibility that the original forms ofJ and P were "closer to each other than the relics of these sources now suggest", and also notes the possibility that "only one source was used by the writer of Genesis". In either case, "the Genesis flood story is a coherent narrative" (p. 347). On the usual critical hypothesis about the flood story, the P version has been preserved more fully, and the J source used only to supplement it. It is, therefore, unnecessary to discuss J's omis- sions, for we do not know how much of J has failed to be preserved: ex hypothesi, the redactor used only what he thought was needed to supplement P. On the other hand, it is necessary to examine the seven items in Wenham's list that are not found in P. Wenham refers to "some notable gaps; there is no divine decision to destroy mankind..., no command to enter the ark, no reconnaissance by the birds, no sacrifice and attendant divine approval" (p. 347), and the full list of omissions is items 1, 5, 7, 12, 13, 15, 16. The list of seven may at once be reduced by two, since items 12 and 13 ("Hero opens window", and "Birds' reconnaissance") are so closely related that they really make up only one item, and the same is true of 15 and 16 ("Sacrifice", and "Divine smelling of sacrifice"). Plausible reasons may be suggested for the five alleged gaps that remain. First, item 1 ("Divine decision to destroy mankind"). In P, vi 11-12 refers to the corruption of the earth, which is seen by God, and vi 13 (item 2, "Warning to flood hero", which is not inJ) tells Noah of God's intention to destroy all flesh, and gives the reason. 14</page><page sequence="15">AN EXAMINATION OF THE FLOOD NARRATIVE IN GENESIS The substance of item 1 is thus adequately conveyed by P, and there is no need to record separately the divine decision. Further, as Dr G. I. Davies has pointed out to me, a decision is involved in the words qes kol-bs'ar ba' lepdnay in vi 13 (cp. 2 Chron. vii 11). Second, item 5 ("Command to enter") is present in vi 18 P; even if Wenham's claim is correct that these words are indicative (see above), not a command, they are sufficiently close to a command to draw the sting of this argument. Third, item 7 ("Closing door") may have been regarded by P as unnecessary, or even as too anthropomorphic. Fourth, item 12/13 ("Hero opens window", and "Birds' recon- naissance") may have been omitted because P regarded it as unnecessary. God makes the decision and commands Noah to leave the ark in viii 15-17 P, and it is inappropriate that Noah should take it upon himself to investigate the situation. Fifth, the absence of item 15/16 ("Sacrifice", and "Divine smelling of sacrifice") is explained by P's unwillingness to recog- nize sacrifice before the sacrificial cult is established in the time of Moses at the command of God. This is related to P's failure to acknowledge the distinction between clean and unclean animals, which is found in J, and also to the permission to Noah in ix 3-4 to eat meat (provided the blood is not consumed) without any mention of sacrifice. Indeed, the absence from P of this item is far from being a difficulty for the theory of source analysis. On the contrary, its presence would have been a problem. IV Wenham's arguments in favour of the coherence of the flood story and against its analysis into sources thus break down. On the other hand, he has not advanced a satisfactory answer to the arguments in favour of source analysis, such as the contradictions in the narrative and the doublets. (5) Y. T. Radday The final writer to be considered contributed an article on "Chiasmus in Hebrew Biblical Narrative" in J. W. Welch (ed.), Chiasmus in Antiquity (Hildesheim, 1981), pp. 50-117, and he discusses the flood narrative on pp. 99-100. Against those who 15</page><page sequence="16">J. A. EMERTON analyse the story into sources he maintains that "Closer inspection shows that what seems a chain of repetitions and contradictions much rather forms a well-balanced 'up and down' both of the Flood and of the tale." Like Wenham, he claims to perceive a chiastic pattern with viii 1 as the hinge: A "A Divine monologue" (vi 3, 7) B "it grieved Him to His heart" (vi 6) C "I will establish My covenant" (vi 18) D "Four stages of entering the ark 'as commanded"' (vi 22, vii 5, 9, 16) E "Go into the Ark" (vii 1) F "the fountains of the deep burst forth" (vii 11) G "Seven verbs of 'ascent"' (vii 17, 18, 19) H "God remembered Noah" (viii 1) G "seven verbs of 'descent"' (viii 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) F "the fountains of the deep were closed" (viii 2) E "Go forth from the ark" (viii 11) D "Four stages of leaving the ark" (viii 7, 8, 10, 12) B "the Lord said in His heart" (viii 21-Radday's viii 20 is a slip) C "I established My covenant" (ix 9) A "A Divine monologue" (ix 12-16) As with the other alleged examples of chiasmus in the Old Testa- ment that he discusses in his article, Radday presents statistics which, he claims, can in certain cases show whether the chiasmus is likely to be "a product of chance" or "of the author's intent" (p. 52). The validity of the statistical argument depends, however, on the plausibility of the chiastic analysis, and the plausibility of Radday's treatment of the flood story will now be examined. It may readily be agreed that there are places where earlier and later parts of the story correspond to each other, whether the correspondence was intended by the author or authors as a literary device or whether it was merely a natural part of the story (see above, pp. 7-8, 10). It is, for example, far from surprising that one part of the story speaks of the flood waters increasing and another of their diminishing and disappearing. The two are natural elements in the story of a flood. Further, the recognition of correspondences is not necessarily incompatible with a theory that the story is a combination of material from different sources. Thus, 16</page><page sequence="17">AN EXAMINATION OF THE FLOOD NARRATIVE IN GENESIS the command to enter the ark in vii 1 corresponds-not surprisingly-to the command to leave it in viii 11 (Radday's E and E ), and both are usually ascribed to J, whereas P is regarded as the author of the references in vii 11 to the opening of the fountains of the deep and to their closing in viii 2 (F and F ), and to the cover- ing of the mountains in vii 19 and their being seen again in viii 5 (part of G and G ). The question is not whether there are correspondences, but whether the detailed analysis offered by Radday is correct, and whether, if it were correct, it would tell against source analysis. As we have found with other attempts to defend the unity of the flood story, Radday's theory looks impressive at first glance when one sees it set out in diagrammatical form, but it is open to criticism when it is examined in detail. What, then, are its weaknesses? First, the analysis is not as symmetrical as could be wished if the theory were to be convincing; and for an argument for the existence of carefully planned chiasmus to be plausible symmetry is impor- tant. Even as Radday sets out his analysis, C comes in the wrong place: between B and A, not between D and B. Similarly, although E is placed between F and D , in fact E begins in viii 11 after D in viii 7 (and D ends in viii 12 after E ). G , however, begins in viii 1 before F in viii 2, but the rest of the verbs in G come in viii 2-5 after F . Further, C overlaps with A . While C 's words waaniz hinenz meqzm 'et-beriti ittekem ... in ix 9 pick up C's wahaqimo6t )et-beritz 'ittdk in vi 18, the earlier verse is also echoed in ix 11 (wahdqimoti ?et-beriti )ittekem) and 17 (habberzt Adser hqi-moti ...), and ix 17 comes after A (cp. also the references to covenant in ix 12-13, 16). Why does Radday regard only verse 9 as significant for C in ch. ix? There is also a difficulty in A and A . Radday ascribes vi 3, 7 to A, but only the latter verse speaks directly of the flood. vi 7, however, comes after B, and so does not fit Radday's scheme. Secondly, Radday's labelling of some items in his alphabetical list is open to challenge. I have already noted a difficulty with A. It is also questionable whether B is satisfactory: while vi 6 and viii 21 both contain the phrase 'el-libbo, they are otherwise different in subject matter: the former speaks of Yahweh being grieved and the latter of Yahweh speaking to himself. Is the phrase 'el-libbo suffi- ciently significant to establish this element as a deliberate part of the chiasmus? (Incidentally, vi 6 and viii 21 are both ascribed to J and, if there is a deliberate chiasmus, it does not tell against source 17</page><page sequence="18">J. A. EMERTON analysis.) Radday's description of D and D as "Four stages of entering" or "leaving the ark" is also questionable. Two of the alleged four stages of entering, namely, vi 22 and vii 5, do not say that anyone or anything entered the ark, and so the number four must be reduced to two. There are, indeed, four references to leav- ing the ark in viii 7, 8, 10, 12, but they speak, as Radday says, of "once a raven, thrice a dove": these verses do not refer to the departure of the animals in general whose entry is recorded in vii 9, 16. The verse that records the general departure, and thus corresponds to vii 9, 16, is viii 19, which Radday does not mention. If, however, Radday were to limit his D to vii 9, 16 and change his D to viii 19, he could no longer say that there are four relevant verbs in each, and his D would come in the wrong place, partly between E and F and partly after F (which is vii 11). Further, it is strange that Radday finds a significant place in his chiasmus for animals entering and leaving the ark, but not for the entry and departure of human beings (apart from the commands in E and E ), although one might have expected them to be regarded as more important. The relevant verses are vii 7 (between E and F) and 13 (within D, and between F and G) for entering, and viii 18 (between D and B ) for leaving. An obvious correspondence in the text has thus not been included by Radday in his scheme; if it had been included, it would not have fitted his pattern. G and G are also unsatisfactory-for a further reason in addition to what is said above. Of the seven verbs of "ascent" in G, four refer to the rising of the waters (wayyirbu in vii 17, wayyigberu and wayyirbu me od in vii 18, and gdberu in vii 19), and perhaps the same may be said of the covering of the mountains in vii 19. But two of the verbs in vii 17 do not: wayyis&amp;u has the waters as its subject but it is concerned with the lifting up of the ark and does not itself say directly that the waters rose, and wattarom has the ark, not the waters, as its subject. Similarly, in viii 4 the ark is the subject of wattdnah. The differences put into question Radday's attempt to group together seven verbs in each part of the alleged chiasmus. Thirdly, it was noted above that, although Radday tries-not very successfully-to fit into his scheme the entry of animals into the ark and their leaving it again, he omits the entry and departure of human beings. There are other places where verses that corre- spond to each other and might be supposed to be more important than some of Radday's examples (certainly more important than 18</page><page sequence="19">AN EXAMINATION OF THE FLOOD NARRATIVE IN GENESIS the phrase 'el-libbo) find no place in his scheme. The statement in vi 5 wekol-yeser mahsebot libbo [i.e. of hddddm] raq rac appears to be important because it gives the reason for divine judgement in the flood, and it is echoed towards the end of the story in viii 21: yeser leb hdadddm rac (see above, p. 10). One might expect these cor- responding passages to appear in Radday's scheme. But they do not. If they did, vi 5 would come between the first part of A and B, and viii 21 between B and C; that would not suit the pattern. It also seems likely that the references to chronology in vii 6, 11-12, 17, 24, viii 3-5, 13-14 were important to the author or authors; if there was one author and he was responsible for the whole flood story and wished to organize his material in a chiastic pattern, he might have been expected to fit the chronological references into that pattern. vii 11-12, 17 begin between E and F and are partly within D, and so they might be said to correspond to viii 3-5 between F and E, but viii 13-14 does not fit because it comes between D and B , and vii 24 comes between G and H. After setting out his pattern of alleged examples of chiasmus, Radday goes on to state that the story is divided into two parts: vi 1-vii 24, of forty-four verses; and viii 1-ix 17, of thirty-nine verses. He calls them "two equal parts" (it would have been more accurate to add "approximately" before "equal"), and says: "The symmetry is marked by a play on words derived from the root nwh. " Thus we have in the first part wayyinndhem in vi 6 and nihamti in vi 7; and in the second part mdnoah in viii 9, ni.hoah in viii 21, and wattdnah in viii 4. The first two examples are not, in fact, derived from the root nwh but from nhm; but Radday's argument depends essentially on word-play and not on the use of the same root. The consonants n and h occur in Noah's name,. and a play on words (as in v 29) is possible-though not certain. The relevant words occur between A and B (vi 6), B and C (vi 7); and between F and E (viii 4, 9, but viii 4 is also within G, and viii 9 within D ), and B and C (viii 21). If a correspondence between the two verbs from nhm in the first part and the three words from nwh in the second was intended, why are they not arranged chiastically, and why is the number of relevant verbs in each part not the same? Thus, Radday's attempt to find a chiastic scheme in the flood story is open to question, and his apparent belief that it offers an argument in support of the story's unity and against "disentangling the sources" (p. 99; cp. also his remarks on pp. 50, 111) must be 19</page><page sequence="20">J. A. EMERTON rejected. On the other hand, he offers no explanation of the difficulties that have led scholars to postulate the existence of two sources in the flood story. Since Radday's article is concerned with chiasmus, it might be argued that a discussion of such difficulties is outside its scope. But Radday has himself raised the question of source analysis and appears to believe that his chiastic scheme is relevant to it, and his argument is incomplete without a considera- tion of the difficulties. Conclusion I have examined five attempts to defend the unity of the flood narrative against those who believe it to be composed out of two sources, and have given reasons for finding none of them convinc- ing. The justification for devoting time and space to such an investigation arises from the present state of Pentateuchal scholar- ship. Whereas thirty years ago the classical theory of source analysis was generally accepted, except among conservative scholars, it has more recently been challenged by a number of scholars, not all of whom are conservative in their theology.2 Such challenges remind other scholars of the need to check the evidence to see whether the older critical theories are sound, or whether they should be modified or rejected. In such discussions the flood story has a posi- tion of special importance. Further, recent years have seen a grow- ing interest, which is in itself legitimate, in the literary artistry displayed in the Old Testament. Among other things, this interest has led to a search for examples of chiasmus-and we have seen that such a search has played an important part in some attempts to maintain the unity of the flood narrative against theories of source analysis. Indeed, the search for examples of chiasmus has become fashionable, and some scholars appear to regard it as a key that will open many doors. While chiasmus undoubtedly appears from time to time in the Hebrew Bible, not all the examples that have been alleged stand up to detailed examination. It would help the progress of Old Testament study if those who believe that they 2 A recent example by a reputable scholar is R. N. Whybray, The Making of the Pentateuch. A Methodological Study (Sheffield, 1987). It is interesting to note that p. 83 mentions the flood narrative and refers to Wenham for "the inner coherence and artistic patterning of the story". 20</page><page sequence="21">AN EXAMINATION OF THE FLOOD NARRATIVE IN GENESIS 21 have found instances were to be self-critical and strict in their methods and to subject their theories to rigorous testing before seeking to publish them. So far, at least, the use of such methods has not succeeded in providing a satisfactory alternative to the theory that the flood story is a compilation based on two sources.</page></plain_text>
