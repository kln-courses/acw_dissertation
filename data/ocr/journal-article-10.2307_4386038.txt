E. Stechert &amp; Co. (I908). PP. 452. $2.25. American classical scholars have been very ready to contribute the results of their study and reflec- tion to all kinds of publications, and in many cases these papers have been collected into volumes and. constitute a valuable part of our literature; but otherwise, outside of editions and technical treatises, very few have published any extensive study of ancient life and conditions; consequently, the book under review is a unique appearance. Professor Sihler is well known for his exact and searching scholarship; in his Testimonium Animae he gives evidence of these qualities on every page. He has a healthy contempt for second-hand sources, and for his knowledge of ancient conditions harks back in every instance to the ancient authors them- .selves. Such a practise is apt to lead to remark- able results, for throughout the long period of in- crustation of commentary upon commentary, and of investigation upon investigation, the actual facts of ancient life have often been strangely hidden. The book in brief is an investigation into the fundamental principles underlying the life of Greece and Rome before the advent of Christianity. Before proceeding to the detailed examination of ancient life he discusses, in two introductory chap-</page><page sequence="2">2I6 THE CLASSICAL WEEKLY ters, first, the general implications of classical cul- ture as understood by philosophical thinkers of the modern age from Herder to Matthew Arnold, and, secondly, the moral atmosphere of the humanists- the atmosphere inaugurated by Petrarch at the Re- vival of Learning. He shows that humanism was in reality a revival of paganism, cloaking under an outward worship of classical form the most flagrant immorality combined with a cynical view of all re- ligious questions. In Chapter III (Gods and Men in Homer and Hesiod), Professor Sihler shows that in the Ho- meric conception the gods were little more than personified animal instincts. There was no spiritual feeling; "Neither purity nor humility nor mercy have a seat at the Olympian board . . . the gods are merely .narrowed powers and impulses of men . . . lustful and adulterous even . . . to such an extent that many Greek teachers and scholars were disturbed at the picture of the gods that Hlomer gives". In play after play we find along with aesthetic ideals, more is discernible than an attempt to. develop a philosophy of actual life, a feeling that the govern- ing principle is fate, but a fate. that "is incomputable and incalculable", "akin to blind whim". Their mo- rality "in the main is of the utilitarian order", and their wisdom "is that of deeper and better fathomed self-interest". Practical wisdom is the chief end of men. The lyric poets, too (Chapter V), have no uplifting message. There is beauty, there is art in their work, but the canker that underlies all Greek life is also in evidence throughout. In the iambic writers, particularly, we notice the abandon- ment entirely of the Greek virtue of self-control and sanity. What was left untouched in the earlier period is debased in this. "Even the noble figture of Penelope is dragged down from the superb elevation of the Odyssey. . . . Thus, with all the canonization of Homer, the Greeks honored neither the heroism of the Iliad, for which dishonor there was more warrant, nor the lady of Ithaca". The lowest depth of erotic depravity is observed in Sappho. The Greeks did worship heroes (Chapter VI), btut this worship was largely connected with tLe narrowness of the Greek communal life, and was really the canonization of men to whom they had been under obligations. Even here there is no ap- preciation for the human soul and its destiny. It was the worship of naturalness under which was understood the naturalness of Kypris. Buit there was a reaction against this Homeric at- titude of the Greeks toward all things moral and spiritual which was partly voiced by Pythagoras and his school. To them the body was not the sumnnzurn bonum of existence, but the prison, the tomb. We find that craving after genuine immortality (Chapter VII) also apparent in the celebrations of mystic rites that took place in various parts of Greece. Still even Pythagoras could not escape the feeling that the regulation of this life was not left to the discretion of map, but was under the domination of the gods. "There was very little of genuine spirituality in the secret rites. *The circle of life there was, the symbolism of the endless succession of seed and fruit, of germ and growth, but there was no radical emancipation from the prevalent na- ture-cult". The interpretation of the attitude of the gods to man, their envy, their jealousy, their ir- responsible arbitrariness are everywhere apparent, even in such an author as Aeschylus, great and noble though he was. "Even he could not divest the sovereign deity of Zeus of the low and mean elements which stained it in all the legends". In Herodotus, too, while he delights in bright and, sunny things, there occurs incessantly that "stern and awful motive, the envy of the gods, a theme which he elevates into a veritable philosophy of history". A whole chapter (IX) is devoted to Sophocles of Kolonos, the great example of Greek tragedy, but this man was stained in his private life by the regular Greek perversion and could not, with all his power, get away from Homeric tradition of the gods. In play after play we find along with aesthetic ideals a repetition of the Homeric revolting myths. In Euripides (Chapter X) a new element enters. He was early filled with the conviction that God must be preeminently good, and, as a consequence, was forced to turn his back upon the legends of the gods of Greece. Not only do we find two heroes in Euripides's plays who are distinguished, by chas- tity, but we find the attempt everywhere to elevate the human soul. Euripides was not devoted to the standards current in his day; he held world-wide views, and he was profoundly in earnest, a su- premely spiritual soul. Chapter XI (The Triad of Greek Thinkers) is one of the most valuable in the book. The thinkers referred to are Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. It is impossible to summarize the chapter, but it might be worth while to quote a few sentences. Socrates emphasized this "great theme-namely, that the souil is very precious-among a people than whom no other ever more highly prized the comeliness of the physical person". His fundamental error lay "in the belief that wrong acting and all sin could or must be reduced to faulty judgment". He sought to conceive the gods in a loftier way than was cus- tomary, for, as Xenophon says, "he held that gods were concerned for men not in the fashion in which the general public hold; . . . the gods knew all things,. both what was said and what was done and what was deliberated in silence, and 'were present everywhere and made signification to men about all human affairs. . . . The argument of aesign was one of the foremost things in his soul-he' claimed here the manifest revelation of a divine providence".</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL WEEKLY 217 While he made great use of Homer, he seems to have ignored the Homeric anthropomorphism. "So- crates then, in facing death, soberly and gravely, not in a rapture of enthusiasm, but, if I may say so, with supreme intelligence and with no transcendental consolation or spiritual support, is a grave figure". Plato "Early in bis intellectual life . . . despaired of satisfying his soul with this material nature of sense and seeming". His hard problem was "to understand how omnipotence and goodness could be conceived as being consistent with the actual sin and evil in the world. And as for the essential goodness of God he maintained it with categorical affirmation. . . . Is it well with the sotul, the pri- mary part of man"? was to Plato "the criterion of life and happiness". Plato's tenet was "the primacy of the soul and its supremacy in the hier- archy of being due to its essential resemblance, as to its source and as to its aim, to God". Aristotle was the most remarkable of the ancients, called by Dante "the Master of those who know', but he looked upon knowledge from the scientific rather than from the ethical standpoint. According to Aristotle "God needs no friend; bliss is in himself. . . . An academic and cosmic God, but singularly and utterly severed from human beings by his es- sence". "Contemplation is Aristotle's personal ideal; his confession of faith. His God is absorbed in contemplation; he is the Intelligence of the Uni- verse; therefore, the searching and the thinking philosopher is nearest to God. . . . The life and con- duct of man is to be determined by himself alone. There is no anticipation of a life to come, nor any divine law imposing itself upon men. . . . Pleas- tire is the crown and result of all moral or perfect action. . . . There is a curious and painful lack of absoltite and universal law in Aristotle's ethics". Passing over the next two chapters on Hellenic l)ecay and Morality and The Actual Worship in Greek Communities we come to the discussion of Roman spiritual elements. This is much briefer than the Greek, occupying but one-fourth of the book, and is treated with much more sympathy. The Romani spirit is much more seriouis than the Greek; it is devoted to the actual, the real, the concrete, and the ideal of duity is a fundamental one. This is shown in their political organization, their method of living and the minutiae of their worship. Bult eveni in Rome there was little of gentuine spiritutality, thoukh there was a great deal of stern morality based rather on practical than on ethical founda- tions. The Roman worthies that Professor Sihler treats are Cicero, Cato of Utica, Lucretirs, Horace and the greater Seneca. He treats them all with keen discrimination and sympathy, not overlooking their faults and weaknesses, but showing throughout that they represent in general progressive types an(d that they are thinkers striving more or less unaide(d after spiritual growth. There is a general apparent preparation for the advent of Christianity shown in these men, and in Seneca we find this unaided progress most complete. The high estimate of Sen- eca, which is unquestionably deserved, is somewhat out of keeping with the present view of that ver- satile philosopher, but seems to be well founded and may possibly have something to do with bring- ing about a rehabilitation of his work in the eyes of modern thinkers. The book as a whole is a very important treatise to sttudents of the history of theology. It is like- wise of great value to students of the Classics, not that classical scholars are unaware-at least, in a general way-of most of what Professor Sihler observes, but in the course of centuries the origins. of Greek life and feeling have become dimmed, and our attention is now directed more to the finished literary product. It is a matter of congratulation that the elements of decay from which sprung the flower of Greek literature are practically unobserved by all younger students of the Classics. Homer makes his appeal without inspiring any conscious- ness of the actual nature of- certain mythological relations. The- stories of the' gods are regarded by most children, if not by all, as in the same liiae with otur fairy tales. The purifying power of ignorance has idealized almost all that is corrupt, and there? fore the study of the Classics still remains an abiding power for sane and good enjoyment as well a-s for training. Consequently while it is desirable that those who teach the Classics should know all that is in Professor Sihler's book, it should not make them pessimistic as to their value, nor should it lead them to the mistake that because the soil is often fetid, the flower is therefore tainted.
