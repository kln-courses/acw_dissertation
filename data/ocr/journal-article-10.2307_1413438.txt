The psychology of the Genevan naturalist and philosopher, Charles Bonnet (1720-1793), has been discussed in some detail by Offner (1893) and Speck (I897). The present memoir, published on the occasion of the jubilee of the University of Geneva (1559-1909), deals with Bonnet only as a comparative psychologist. After a sketch of his subject's life and work, Professor Claparede devotes three chapters to his views of the mind of animals, instinct, and the capacity of adapta- tion to a changed environment. The following chapters discuss Bon- net's ideas regarding maternal love in animals, the comparative intelli- gence of man and the lower animals, and the 'personality' of crea- tures, like Hydra and Lumbriculus, whose severed parts may regener-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 475 ate the complete organism. A few pages are given to the philosophical flights of the Palingenesie, which the author regards as a sort of de- fensive reaction on Bonnet's part, due to his need of reconciling the cruelty of nature and the all-goodness of the Creator; and the memoir ends with a lucid summary. Bonnet-who, it may be noted, employs the terms experimental psy- chology, psychophysical, and psychometer a century before Fechner ap- pears upon the scene-was essentially an observer, anti-anthropomorphic and anti-teleological, faithfully concerned with facts. His system, so far as he is systematic, is a psychophysical parallelism couched in the traditional terms of dualistic interactionism. He would willingly have dispensed with the notion of mind, and have spoken solely of phe- nomena of irritability; but mind proved to be indispensable, and accordingly plays its part in his exposition. Nevertheless, Bonnet never seeks to explain by reference to end. " One may say that, in his view, mind reigns, but does not govern. It signs the decrees which the body submits to it in the form of needs, so as to validate them and make them mandatory; but that is all; it never intervenes as a foreign power in the determinations of the body." Bonnet thus has nothing in common with neo-vitalism. Historically, Bonnet is one of the first students of animal psy- chology who added experiment to simple observation. His influence upon his contemporaries was large; he inspired much of the work of Franqois and Pierre Huber. His scientific attitude and his posi- tive achievement make his work worthy of study at the present day. A two-color crayon portrait of Bonnet (perhaps by Michel Liotard), with his signature of 1777, forms the frontispiece of the memoir. Pro- fessor Claparede is to be congratulated upon this interesting and useful contribution to the commemorative publications of his university.</page></plain_text>
