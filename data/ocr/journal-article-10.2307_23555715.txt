The article reviews six lines of research, with particular focus on issues of ecologi cal validity, the use of contrast conditions, and theoretical grounding. Keywords neurotheology, Michael Persinger, Nina Azari, relaxation response, social cognition I. Introduction Brain science has become increasingly popular in the humanities. A few decades ago, experimental neuroscience was almost exclusively used in the study of basic biological and psychological processes. Now, the wide distribu tion and availability of modern brain scanners invites the humanities to inves tigate the neural processes that underlie even more complex cultural phenomena. These advanced technologies enable researchers to design and test causal hypotheses of religious behaviour by using the insights on brain func tion as a point of departure. Classic theories on the emotional and cognitive aspects of religious experience now appear to be experimentally testable. Not surprisingly, such prospects have resulted in incredibly high expectations to ' This is a revised and expanded version of an article originally published in Danish (Schjoedt 2007).

The prospects for eventually being able to answer age-old questions that have been under considerable debate among scholars of religion are tantalizing. Experiments demonstrating whether religious behaviour is dominated by emotion or reason, or whether religious experience is a unique mental phenomenon or simply a by-product of human thought, are almost too good to be true. This is also the reason why neuroscience has unwittingly become an effective tool for myth creation and wild speculations about reli gious brain processes and God modules. However, one could ask: does it makes sense to ask such categorical questions at all in the context of the mod ern study of religion? This article is an introduction to the experimental neu roscience approach, intended for scholars of religion who have an interest in the neurobiological and cognitive aspects of religion, but who do not have the necessary background knowledge to evaluate this exciting fields limitations and potential. At present, only a small number of studies exist on the relation between neural activity and religious behaviour, and the majority of these have focused on how religiously inspired techniques of meditation modulate practitioners' states of consciousness. These studies have been reviewed in an article by B. Rael Cahn &amp; John Polich (2006), which I recommend to readers with a specific interest in meditation practices. However, meditation does not neces sarily include references to supernatural beings, so treating religious practice and meditation under the same category is not without its problems (Shapiro 1982: 286). Religious practice and experience is in itself a problematic cate gory, although it has played a major role in the experimental neuroscience of religion. Most studies have used monks, nuns or meditation experts from widely different cultures under the assumption that different forms of praying and techniques of meditation fundamentally express the same category of human experience (Persinger 1983; Saver &amp; Rabin 1997; Newberg &amp; d'Aquili 1999; Azari et al. 2001; Previc 2006). The behavioural diversity observed in anthropological, psychological and sociological records, however, demonstrates an enormous variability of religious practice: (a) within individuals over time and context; (b) among individuals with different personalities and social status; and (c) among cul tures with different climatic, demographic, historical and socio-economic properties. Some rituals are performed several times daily, while others take place only once in a lifetime (Whitehouse 2000; McCauley &amp; Lawson 2002); some prayers are formalized recitations, while others are improvised conversa tions (Weber 1904; Mauss 1909; Whitehouse 2000); some meditation tech niques draw attention to the sensory input from the external world, while others focus on specific mantras and bodily activities (Cahn &amp;C Polich 2006).</page><page sequence="3">312 U. Schjoedt / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 Religious behaviour encompasses widely different thoughts and practices and must be assumed, like other forms of mental practice, to differ widely in both cognitive content and corresponding neural correlates. This article reviews six lines of research that use experimental neuroscience to study religious behaviour. They each represent a specific approach to the field, and some of them have had significant impact in the media. These six projects, to my knowledge, cover all published experiments using imaging technology on religious practices other than meditation.2 Each project will be critically evaluated with a strong focus on issues of ecological validity, the use of contrast conditions, and theoretical grounding. However, due to the lim ited format of a journal article, I will not pursue an in-depth analysis of each study but focus instead on their scientific strengths and weaknesses. The first project tests the hypothesis that religious experience corresponds to a specific altered state of consciousness. The second project is a clinical approach to examine the hypothesized health promoting effects of religious practices. The third project is a particularly controversial study, where the mystical experience of a "felt" presence is associated with specific electrical impulses in the brain. The fourth project uses imaging technology to answer the question whether religious behaviour is dominated by cognition or emo tion. The fifth project is a relatively new study that investigates the neural substrates of Christian mystical experience. Finally, the sixth project is the University of Aarhus project, where we investigate what happens in the brain when religious subjects converse with God in different forms of praying. The article concludes with a few comments on the future status of experi mental neuroscience in the study of religion which, over the last two decades, has experienced a growing interest in the cognitive and neurobiological aspects of its subject matter (Whitehouse 2000; Boyer 1994, 2001, 2003; Lawson &amp; McCauley 1990; McCauley &amp; Lawson 2002). I argue that in order to under stand the complexity of religious practices and experiences in terms of cogni tive processes and brain function at least two important issues need to be addressed. First, rather than developing new controversial claims on brain pro 1 The only imaging study on religious cognition that I know of which is not reviewed in this article is Han et al. who used Christian and non-religious participants to investigate differences of self-referential processing in personal-trait judgements (Han et al. 2008). They found more neural activation of the ventral medial prefrontal cortex in non-religious participants which they associate with processing of self-relevance stimulus, and more activation in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex in Christian participants which they associate with evaluation of self-referential stimulus. These findings are interpreted as a consequence of the Christian belief in an insignifi cant self (therefore less processing of self-relevance) and in a judging God (therefore more evalu ation of self-referential stimulus). The study is not reviewed, because it does not investigate an actual practice.</page><page sequence="4">U. Schjoedt / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 313 cesses unique to religious experience, experimental neuroscience should rely on conventional theories of brain function. Second, experimental neurosci ence must appreciate the diversity of religious thought and behaviour analyzed by the comparative study of religion for more than 130 years. However, I will begin this introduction by introducing some of the general methods and pro cedures in experimental neuroscience and sketch some of the technical and methodological challenges in this promising field. II. Methods and Procedures Most of the experiments reviewed in this article measure the brain's blood flow by using imaging technologies such as SPECT (Single Photon Emission Com puted Tomography), PET (Positron Emission Tomography) or fMRI (func tional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) which are all stationary scanning technologies, usually located at a hospital research unit. In most of these stud ies, participants arrive at the hospital and receive instructions about the scan ning procedures and safety regulations before being placed in the scanner, which typically covers the participants head and torso (fMRI). In PET and SPECT studies, participants are injected with a radioactive tracer prior to the examination which traces the blood flow in the brain by emission of radiation. In studies using MR-technology, participants will experience noise (app. 110 db) from the magnets measuring the blood flow from changes in the bloods magnetic properties. Participants are instructed not to move, and often the head is fixed to avoid potential movement traces in the data. While lying in the scanner, participants often receive stimuli and instructions through head phones or on a screen. In order to measure which brain areas are active in a particular condition, it is necessary to contrast the target condition with one or more contrast condi tions. Contrast conditions typically include a "rest" condition, in which sub jects can think about whatever they want, and a mental task, which is similar to the target condition in all aspects except for the aspect of interest. For example, the recital of a religious text can be contrasted to the recital of a non religious text if it is the aim of the analysis to filter out the effect of recitation.3 Target and contrast conditions are typically repeated several times during ses sions to increase the statistical power of the analysis. The raw data from the scanner are pre-processed before analysis. This usually consists of a series of complex procedures that transforms the data from each subject to fit onto a 3 This is called a pure insertion paradigm. There are other ways of designing experiments, e.g., by employing factorial paradigms.</page><page sequence="5">314 U. Schjoedt / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 template brain which is then used for group analysis. Finally, a range of advanced statistical analyses are applied to the pre-processed data to reach the results that most people know from newspapers and journal articles, where probability maps show the regional differences of blood flow as plots with graded colour intensities on a brain image. This brief description is crude and generic, but it illustrates some of the most common methodological and technological issues in imaging studies. First, there is the issue of ecological validity. Ecological validity refers to the authenticity of the subjects' behaviour. There are several factors in the scan ning procedure that potentially compromise this authenticity. For some peo ple, being in a hospital is enough to generate anxiety, while others experience severe claustrophobia when their heads are fixed and their bodies enter the scanner. The injection in PET studies can be associated with discomfort, and the noise from the MR scanner can make it difficult for the participants to concentrate. Poor instructions, dubious stimuli and problematic contrast con ditions can ruin the experimental paradigm, causing the task of interest to be executed in ways other than experimenters expect. The contrast conditions are problematic if they resemble the target conditions too much so that the signals of interest disappear in the contrast, or if the contrasts are too different so that the signals of interest are flooded by too many irrelevant brain activations. If the recital of a religious text (verbal/active) is contrasted with listening to music (auditory/passive), the results will show massive brain activations because the two conditions are widely different cognitive processes. But these activations do not say anything about the religious aspects of the recital and are thus irrelevant for the study of religion. If, on the other hand, the contrast condition resembles the target condition too much, there is a risk of activating the same areas in the brain causing potentially interesting activations to remain hidden in the analysis or even to come out as deactivations relative to the contrast condition. Unfortunately, the brain does not offer a default baseline condition which could work as a universal contrast in imaging studies. For example, in so-called baseline conditions where the participant is instructed to rest, it is difficult for the experimenter to control what the participant is actu ally doing; he or she could be practicing the task of interest! This is why brain scientists and scholars of religion have to critically consider the contrasts of choice in any study reported on religious practice and its neural correlates. Pre-processing the imaging data is another story, and I will not discuss the technical details here. It is important, however, to be aware that the raw data from the scanner undergo massive transformations before being used in the statistical analyses. Critical assumptions about the neural processes and func tional neuroanatomy together with a wide range of manipulations and trans</page><page sequence="6">U. Schjoedt / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 315 formations of the raw data render the connection between the processed data and the hypothesized blood flow in the individual brain indirect. The activa tion patterns presented in journal articles are not analogue brain signals but statistical maps of the probability of true signals. The number of participants in imaging studies is important for the statisti cal power of the results. Depending on number (the studies reviewed use between 3-15 participants), results sometimes only inform us on the neural activity of the persons participating in the study rather than the wider popula tion from which the sample is taken. Furthermore, the data analysis is depen dent on the questions addressed by the researcher which means that the results reported in journals, at best, mirror a set of prior hypotheses advanced by the experimenter and therefore should not be taken as objective descriptions of the data. This problem is not trivial in the scientific study of religion because external funding from special-interest organizations like The John Templeton Foundation, who promote collaboration between science and reli gion, may influence which hypotheses get examined and how the results are interpreted. III. Altered States of Consciousness The work of Eugene G. d'Aquili and Andrew B. Newberg on religious experi ence and brain activity is almost classic, and their methods and theories are prototypical examples of how research is being conducted in this field. D Aquili and Newberg develop a surprisingly detailed account of mystical experience on the basis of both novel claims of brain mechanisms and conventional neuroscience. According to dAquili and Newberg's theory, religious experience in rituals and meditation is caused by an overload of the limbic structures involved in emotions and homeostatic regulations, e.g., the hypothalamus and the amyg dala. This overload of stimuli blocks perceptual input which in turn causes a deafferentation of the associative areas and eventually leads to an altered state of consciousness. A prominent example of this mechanism is the blocking of input to posterior superior parietal cortex (PSPL) which according to dAquili and Newberg induces an experience of absolute unitary Â¿Â«Â«g-with the world or higher order of reality. PSPL is supposedly the brain region that constantly processes representations of the spatial dichotomy between self and others (Newberg &amp; dAquili 1998, 87), but when it gets blocked from perceptual input from the sensory apparatus, this process runs amok which suspends the dichotomy. This regional isolation occurs through two different processes</page><page sequence="7">316 U. Schjoedt / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 characteristic of religious practice. One process floods the brain by sympa thetic or parasympathetic activities during rhythmic practices and rich sensa tions as seen in ritual ceremonies causing a direct blocking of PSPL. Another process, which is associated with focused attention in meditation, activates the sympathetic processes of the autonomous nervous system through the hip pocampus and amygdala. Via feedback, this process increases activity in the prefrontal cortex, causing a total blocking of PSPL (d'Aquili &amp; Newberg 1999: 109-118). Newberg and d'Aquili have tested their theory using functional brain imag ing (SPECT). In one study with eight Tibetan Buddhist meditators (Newberg et al. 2001), results did show increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal areas and decreased activity in the superior parietal cortex (SPL). According to Newberg and d'Aquili this suggests that the meditators experienced a suspen sion of the self-other dichotomy. A surprising aspect of this study is the lack of qualitative data in support of their claims. The participants were not inter viewed about their subjective experience in the scanner even though such data are clearly important to Newberg and d'Aquili's interpretation. In another study (SPECT), five volunteers from the Pentecostal movement were scanned during glossolalia (Newberg et al. 2006). This study reported decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex but increased activity in the SPL, the opposite pattern of the Tibetan meditation study. The decrease of prefron tal activity is interpreted as a result of the lack of control during glossolalia which is contrary to the focused attention of meditation. The increased activ ity in SPL is not discussed in the report, but, according to Newberg et al., the reason why SPL activity did not decrease is that glossolalia does not necessarily dissolve the self-other dichotomy. In a third study (SPECT), Newberg et al. (2003) investigated the neural correlates of prayer recitation by three Francis can nuns. In this study, they did find a negative correlation between prefrontal activity and SPL activations relative to the contrast condition which corre sponds to the results from the Tibetan meditation study. The significant differences observed in glossolalia and meditation suggest that spiritual practices like other forms of mental practice differ widely in both cognitive content and corresponding neural correlates. Yet it is unclear whether Newberg and d'Aquili's mixed findings challenge their own basic assumption that religious experience is defined by universal neural mechanisms (d'Aquili &amp; Newberg 1999: 103). Newberg and d'Aquili's theory contains several controversial claims about brain function and the neural correlates of conscious experience. For instance, we do not know if the brain's associative areas, as argued by Newberg and d'Aquili, are divided into dedicated inference systems which process specific</page><page sequence="8">U. Schjoedt I Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 317 higher order cognitive functions [e.g., holistic, reductionistic, abstract, or binary operators (Newberg &amp; d'Aquilli 1999: 52-55)]. We also lack concrete evidence that such a system exists in the PSPL region, and that its cognitive function correlates with the subjective experience of the self-other dichotomy. Furthermore, there is no concrete evidence that the brain can isolate areas of the association cortex without inhibiting its activation (Spezio 2001), and it is difficult to give a natural and evolutionarily viable explanation for such cogni tive mechanisms in normal healthy individuals. The standard assumption in experimental neuroscience is that increased or decreased blood flow corre sponds to the level of function in a particular area, not its level of isolation. Furthermore, Newberg and d'Aquili's experiments are generally subject to the methodological issues common to imaging studies. Results in functional imaging studies refer to the contrast between two conditions. This means that, for example, reduced activity in the prefrontal areas could potentially be caused by a relatively higher prefrontal activity in the contrast condition and thus not by a task-specific decrease in the target condition. This can be illus trated by the glossolalia study (2006), where the contrast condition was a religious song which is a relatively demanding verbal task containing melody and rhythm. The decreased activity of the prefrontal cortex observed in glos solalia may be a product of the relatively higher load on the prefrontal "con centration" in this condition rather than a significant lack of concentration during glossolalia. Anecdotally, I recently analyzed imaging data in Aarhus from one case of glossolalia relative to personal praying. In this contrast, glos solalia showed strong prefrontal activations mainly in regions involved with linguistic processing, e.g., supplementary motor cortex and Brocas area. It would have been helpful if Newberg and d'Aquili had considered the conse quences of task-difficulty and different attention loads between conditions in their discussion of the results because the areas of interest in their hypothesis are sensitive to these factors. In conclusion, Newberg and d'Aquili's project is a good example of how this field of research is able to design experiments and test hypotheses. Flow ever, several controversial notions of brain organization and neural processes make their theory problematical, e.g., the existence of specific cognitive sys tems that get blocked in certain situations causing a specific subjective experi ence (the idea that blocking input to PSPL equals a subjective experience of spatial unity). These assumptions are still largely unsupported, but they should not, of course, be ruled out automatically. The experimental design, however, would require further refinement. One way to examine their ideas would be to use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the brain regions of interest (e.g., PSPL) and see if the experience of absolute unitary being can be induced.</page><page sequence="9">318 U. Schjoedt / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 Another possibility is to investigate the relation between mystical experience and PSPL activity in patients with haemorrhages, infarcts, or focal epilepsy in that particular area. This approach has already been used to study hemispheric religiosity traits in split-brain patients and temporal lobe religiosity in patients with epilepsy (Ramachandran 1998). Newberg and d'Aquili describe their research project as "neurotheology" (d'Aquili &amp; Newberg 1999: 176), which is characterized by the assumption that religious experience as a broader category is subserved by universal brain mechanisms (d'Aquili &amp; Newberg 1999: 103). Such mechanisms, however, remain to be discovered. IV. The Relaxation Response A large portion of the money spent on research on the relation between phys iological processes and religious strategies goes to clinical studies on the health promoting effects of religion. And there are good reasons for this according to a 1993 study concluding that Americans made an estimated 425 million visits to providers of unconventional therapy compared to 388 million visits to pri mary care physicians (Eisenberg et al. 1993). In the broader category of unconventional therapies the most common practices were by far religious ones like personal and intercessory prayers (67% of alternative treatments in the U.S.) (Masters &amp; Spielmans 2007). Several books have been published recently on the relation between religion and health, many of which were significantly supported by the John Templeton Foundation (Benson 1996; Koenig 1998; Koenig et al. 2001). Dr. Herbert Benson, who is head of the Mind-Body Medical Institute at Harvard Medical School, has over the last decades conducted several studies investigating the physiological effects of self-regulatory mental strategies such as prayer and meditation. In a recent and fascinating study (Benson et al. 2006) sponsored by The John Templeton Foundation, Benson analyzed the possible clinical effects of remote interces sory prayer. In this study, which is the largest of its kind (n= 1800), Benson et al. compared the complications following by-pass surgery in three groups of patients. Two groups were uncertain whether they received prayer or not, while the third group was certain they were prayed for. Results showed no positive effects of receiving remote intercessory prayer. Curiously, the group who knew they were prayed for experienced more complications following the surgery compared to the two groups who did not know whether they received prayer (one group did not receive intercessory prayer; the other group did not know they were actually prayed for). The negative result was interpreted as a</page><page sequence="10">U. Schjoedt / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 319 harmful stress-related effect of knowing about the study. This study may per haps be the last of its kind because of ethical issues if participation is associated with a higher health risk. Herbert Benson's main interest, however, lies in the so-called relaxation response (Benson 1976) which includes a range of physiological processes associated with relaxation (e.g., decreased metabolism, reduced oxygen uptake, and heart rate, etc.). According to Benson such parasympathetic processes can be achieved through frequent repetition of simple thoughts and behaviours similar to those observed in religious practice like recitation of prayers, prac ticing daily rituals, and meditation. In addition to the habitual aspect of such repetitive strategies, religious practice often presupposes a belief in a higher truth or supernatural being which is capable of reciprocating the religious effort by answering prayers or rewarding ritual performances. According to Benson this belief contributes to an extra effect similar to that of placebo in medical trials. This extra effect, Benson argues, is caused by a boosting of the relaxation response in practicing individuals. Benson therefore argues that religious strategies ought to be implemented in medical treatments as a supplement to conventional medical therapy for those who already believe (Benson 1996:285). Benson and his colleagues have examined the relation between the relax ation response and brain activity using EEG (Electroencephalography). In an experiment with three experienced Tibetan monks (Benson et al. 1990), Bud dhist meditation was shown to correlate with a general decrease in metabolic rate and a hemispheric asymmetry of brain activity with a global increase of beta-activity which may be associated with concentration and focused atten tion. In other words, the participants did not seem to reach a calm state simi lar to that of sleep, but instead increased their attention during meditation. This description of meditation as a focused state of attention rather than mental rest is supported by other studies of meditation reporting increases of brain activity in regions associated with concentration and focused attention, e.g., the dorsolateral prefrontal areas (Herzog et al. 1990; Jevning et al. 1996; Aftanas and Golocheikine 2001). In order to map the neural correlates of the relaxation response (Lazar et al. 2000), Benson et al. used fMRI-technology to scan the brains of five experi enced Kundalini yoga practitioners performing a specific technique character ized by focus on breathing and recitation of different mantras. As contrast condition the participants were instructed to breathe freely and to list a num ber of random animals. Meditation was practiced for 12 minutes while the contrast task lasted 6 minutes. Epochs of these lengths are normally discour aged in fMRI studies because the magnets of MR-scanners are vulnerable to</page><page sequence="11">320 U. Schjoedt / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 drifting which significantly reduces signal-to-noise ratio. Unfortunately, epochs of this length can be necessary in order for practitioners to reach a meditative state. Results showed activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal areas which Benson and colleagues attribute to the focused attention on breathing and recitation of mantras in the Kundalini practice. At the same time, though reluctantly, Benson and colleagues report activities in several subcortical areas like amygdala and the hypothalamus, structures that are important in regulat ing the autonomic and endocrine processes of the body. This is interpreted in favour of the hypothesis that meditation is capable of influencing the physio logical activities involved in the relaxation response. Like most functional imaging studies, this study investigated the difference between two conditions, a target condition and a contrast condition, in this case a formalized recitation with controlled breathing (Kundalini-practice) relative to an improvised recital with free breathing. The results thus indicate the neural correlates of the aspects of recitation and controlled breathing in Kundalini practice. They do not, however, tell us anything about other medi tation techniques that do not involve formalized recitation and controlled breathing. Other techniques are expected to activate the brain regions that correspond to their particular cognitive properties. On the other hand, several meditation studies have reported dorsolateral prefrontal activity. Thus, regard less of particular techniques, meditation in general seems to correlate with this region as well as the subjective experience of focused attention. Whether this imaging study supports the hypothesis of the relaxation response is uncertain. Imaging studies need a well-defined neural correlate of physiological relaxation induced by cognitive processes before conclusive evi dence can be found. Potential activations of relevant brain stem nuclei are difficult to measure with todays technologies because the image resolutions are still too low. Thus, a clear connection between cognitive processing of religious belief and activation of the relaxation response remains to be discov ered by future studies. V. The God Helmet The Canadian psychologist Michael A. Persinger claims that by stimulating specific patterns of brain activity, it is possible to induce the experience of a "felt" presence in normal healthy subjects. This neural phenomenon, he argues, generates beliefs about supernatural beings and may explain how reli gious systems originated in the first place. Persinger's workâwhich counts almost two hundred articles in the journal of Perceptual and Motor Skills on</page><page sequence="12">U. Schjoedt / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 321 various exotic topics, such as the relation between earthquakes and UFO reports and "haunt" experiences in electronically dense buildings (http:// ejournals.ammonsscientific.com)âis extremely popular with the media. It also represents a controversial scientific approach with important method ological and theoretical issues. In his theory (1983), Persinger builds on the hypothesis that religious and spiritual experiences are related to transient elec trical impulses in the temporal lobe (Persinger 1987). The phenomenon is best known in studies of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy which report fre quent or strong spiritual experiences in patients both during and between seizures (Dewhurst &amp; Beard 1970; Ramachandran 1998; Ogata &amp; Miyakawa 1998). The general idea is that transient electrical charges in the temporal lobe stimulate the region that underlies the subjective experience of a felt presence (Persinger 1983). Persinger expands on this hypothesis by arguing that the "felt" presence may be caused by transient neural impulses in the right hemispheric equivalent to the left-hemispheric processing of self. According to Persinger it is the left hemisphere that represents the self because represen tations of self are closely linked to linguistic processing which is predomi nantly located in the left hemisphere. When the right-hemispheric homologue of sense of self is allowed into the left hemispheric awareness via seizure-like impulses, subjects experience a "felt" presence of another being (Cook &amp; Persinger 1997: 683). In an early experiment (EEG) Persinger observed electrical changes in the temporal lobe in persons practicing transcendental meditation and glossolalia (Persinger 1984), which evidently supported his theory. However, to confirm his hypothesis, Persinger has devised a helmet capable of stimulating the brain through the skull using TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) to see if religious experiences can be induced in normal healthy persons. Participants in Persinger's experiments do not know when the TMS device is active, and sometimes they are instructed to push a button if they experience a felt pres ence. The participants are subsequently asked to describe their experience and complete questionnaires. Persinger's results suggest that the so-called God Helmet works on 80% of the general population, so it is no surprise that his project has attracted massive media coverage by major TV channels such as CNN, BBC and the Discovery Channel (Granqvist et al. 2005). The popular ity peaked when consciousness researcher Susan Blackmore tested the helmet and wrote about her unique spiritual experience during stimulation (Black more 1991, 29-31). Other prominent persons have tried Persinger's God hel met with ambiguous results. The famous biologist Richard Dawkins, who is an avid atheist, underwent the same treatment without experiencing anything.</page><page sequence="13">322 U. Schjoedt / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 Persinger still runs experiments using the God Helmet, and he has recently investigated the relation between different types of mystical experience and specific magnetic pulses. He now claims that he can map specific mystical experiences to specific patterns of magnetic stimulus (Persinger 2001). Persinger's scientific data are controversial. Granqvist et al. (2005) repli cated the experiment in a double-blind, randomized study and did not find comparable TMS effects in their subjects. They concluded that the remarkable experiences in Persinger's subjects must be a product of suggestion which is supported by their own study showing that high scores on a suggestibility scale predict the chance of participants having a mystical experience. Another seri ous concern with Persinger's work is its theoretical background for using TMS. The fact that Persinger uses extremely weak magnetic fields to induce the men tal state is problematical. While clinical TMS research usually involves fields on the order of 1-2 Tesla to excite the brain's neurons, Persinger uses magnetic fields measured in nano and microTesla which approximate the Earth's geo magnetic properties. It is unknown whether such values are capable of affect ing neurons through the skull enough to modulate our subjective experience. One could ask whether, from an evolutionary perspective, it makes sense to have brains that are susceptible to such weak magnetic fields. Persinger needs to provide a persuasive neurobiological explanation as to how the helmet acti vates the neural processes behind mystical experiences. One possible way of further exploring Persinger's hypothesis would be to use supplemental tech nologies with a higher spatial resolution like fMRI, PET, and MEG. Persinger himself doubts the benefits of fMRI and PET because they lack the temporal resolution of the subtle characteristics of the electrical impulses (Cook and Persinger 1997: 690), but MEG with its high temporal and spatial resolution may prove ideal for testing Persinger's hypothesis in the future. VI. Cognition or Emotion? Psychologist Nina P. Azari and colleagues have tried to answer the question of whether religious experience can be characterized mainly by cognitive or emotional processes. Similar to the studies of Persinger and Newberg, Azari assumes that religious experience is subserved by a common set of neural processes (Azari et al. 2001:1651). However, she disagrees with their hypoth esis that religious experience is mainly a precognitive, primitive, and emo tional phenomenon (Azari et al. 2005: 272). Grounded in the attribution theories of psychology represented by Wayne Proudfoot's work, Azari argues that religion develops in a cultural system and that meaning and interpreta</page><page sequence="14">U. Schjoedt / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 323 tion are central features in both spiritual experiences and religious feelings (Azari et al. 2001). This discussion is central in the scientific study of religion. Many scholars follow the pattern of William James, Carl G. Jung, Rudolph Otto, and Mircea Eliade by favouring the notion of a sui generis religious experience. In contrast, social constructivists continue to draw inspiration from Emile Durkheim, George Herbert Mead, Peter L. Berger, and Clifford Geertz by claiming that even basic feelings and common sense notions are products of society. Azari and colleagues join this discussion by analyzing imaging data of the same experiment from different angles (Azari et al. 2001, 2004, 2005). The study measured the brain activity (PET) of six Christian fundamentalists and six non-religious participants under six conditions: reading and reciting the Bible (Psalm 23), reading and reciting a nursery rhyme (non-melodic), reading a neutral text, and simply resting (baseline). Results showed that religious par ticipants activated dorsolateral prefrontal regions in the psalm recital relative to both contrast conditions and control group which is interpreted as the cor relate of the participants recollection of relevant knowledge about religious texts (memory retrieval). Relative to "rest" and "rhyme" the psalm recital also activated the dorsomedial frontal cortex and precuneus. The areas precuneus and dorsomedial frontal cortex have anatomical connections to the prefrontal regions, which supports the hypothesis that a specific distributed neural net work which is controlled by higher order cognitive areas, underlies religious experience (Azari et al. 2001: 1651). According to Azari the observation of cortical activities together with the lack of activity in the limbic system, which is normally associated with emotional processing, suggest that religious experi ence is first and foremost a cognitive phenomenon. In a recent article, Azari and colleagues (2005) returned to the data to inves tigate potential networks separating the rhyme recital from the religious recital by using Principal Component Analysis. In accordance with their prior analy sis they found prefrontal activations to correlate with Bible recitation. The prefrontal cortex has been associated with social cognition and interpersonal interaction, and Azari and colleagues use this evidence (e.g., Vogeley et al. 2001) to argue that this region may subserve the personal experience of God (Azari et al. 2005: 274). The results support Azari's general hypothesis that religious experience is essentially a cultural phenomenon. The finding that Bible recitation activated the prefrontal cortex rather than subcortical regions, Azari argues, suggests that religious experience may take on different expressions in different cultural systems. Interestingly, Azari finds support for this claim in Newberg and d'Aquili s study on Tibetan meditation (2001 ). According to Azari and colleagues</page><page sequence="15">324 U. Schjoedt/Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 the prefrontal activity reported in their study as well as in Newberg and d'Aquilis meditation study, serves the same function in these two fundamen tally different religious experiences. One is within the Christian world view where the personal relation to God plays a major role. The other one is within a Buddhist world view where unitary experience is central (Azari 2005: 275). This interpretation, however, radically separates itself from Newberg and d'Aquilis own explanation of prefrontal activity in meditation. They interpret it as a function of focused attention while it is the isolation of the posterior superior parietal lobe (PSPL) that causes the experience of unity. Azari argues that the particular relation between PSPL and prefrontal cortex in Newberg and d'Aquilis study is merely an indication of the complex nature of medita tion (Azari &amp; Birnbacher 2004: 911). On the contrary, Newberg and d'Aquili argue that the blocking of input to PSPL is caused by a well-defined interac tion in the fronto-parietal networks which originates in the brain's limbic structures, e.g., the hypothalamus and the amygdala. To Newberg and d'Aquili the experience of unity is caused by a precognitive altered state of conscious ness. This discrepancy shows that there really is no clear solution to this classic debate over the nature of religious experience. A few methodological and theoretical issues are also relevant to Azari's study. Like most studies in this field, Azari and colleagues use a very limited number of participants. An analysis of six persons in each group (target and control) is not ideal for generating claims about other than the participants of the study. Increasing the number to fifteen or twenty participants in each group would strengthen their conclusions about the wider population of Ger man Christian Protestant fundamentalists. Another issue worth mentioning is the statistical treatment of the data. Results from the analysis were not cor rected for multiple comparisons (p&lt;0.001), and some of the p-values were thresholded higher than is normally considered significant even for uncor rected results (p&lt;0.01). Uncorrected results of whole brain analyses are usually interpreted as trends in explorative data rather than robust results. Although Azari et al. stress the cultural aspects of religious experience rather than precognitive sensory mechanisms (Persinger 1987; d'Aquili and New berg 1999), they do agree with the general assumption that religious experi ence is a neurologically consistent phenomenon. Azari et al. suggest, however, that "religious experience" may turn out to be divided into a variety of subpro cesses comparable to recent models of memory (Azari et al. 2001). Thus, neu ral activity in one particular religious practice (psalm recitation) may enlighten us on the universal processes of a broader category of religious experience. An example of this neurophenomenological overlap can be found, Azari argues, in the prefrontal activity observed in Newberg and d'Aquilis meditation study</page><page sequence="16">U. Schjoedt/Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 325 which may serve the same function as in the prefrontal activity during psalm recitation. In other words, Azari argues that the prefrontal activity may point to a cross-cultural invariance of religious experience which subserves an "essen tial relational cognitivity" (Azari et al. 2005: 275). However, this "invariance" of prefrontal activity in psalm recitation and meditation may well be more broadly associated with attention and executive processing. This finding, then, may not add anything particular to our understanding of religion as focus and complex processing underlie most complex cultural phenomena that include semantic and linguistic processing, social cognitive inferences, and focused attention. In this perspective the claim of invariance is a neurofunc tional pendant to claiming that religious texts are dependent on human hands and that verbally transmitted myths and rituals are partly due to vocal anat omy (Schjoedt 2008). Regardless of these issues, this project represents a new direction which integrates well-supported insights on the neural substrates of executive func tion, memory, and social cognition to give a plausible account of the observed brain activity in religious practice. Rather than hypothesizing new neural mechanisms subserving the mystical aspects of religion Azari and colleagues rely on better grounded insights on brain function. Whether Azari and her colleagues have found an invariant pattern of neural activity that subserves religious experience across cultures remains an open question. VII. Mystical Experiences In a recent study sponsored by special interest organizations, The John Tem pleton Foundation and The Metanexus Institute, Mario Beauregard and Vincent Paquette (2006) explored the neural substrates of mystical experience in Carmelite nuns. In the study fifteen nuns who described a mystical experience as a feeling of unconditional love and oneness with God were instructed to re-experience a past mystical experience in the scanner. Results, which were not corrected for multiple comparisons (thresholded at p&lt;0.001), showed that a mystical expe rience relative to rest and a non-religious contrast condition (to think of a past happy experience with a human being) activated several brain regions (e.g., the orbitofrontal cortex, temporal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, superior and inferior parietal cortex, caudate nucleus, insula, medial prefrontal cortex, and brain stem). Beauregard and Paquette interpret these regional activations separately by reference to, among others, Persinger, Newberg and d'Aquili. In accordance</page><page sequence="17">326 U. Schjoedt / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 with Persinger's hypothesis and previous research on temporal lobe epilepsy, the activations in the temporal lobe are associated with a felt presence of a spiritual reality. Activations in the parietal cortex are associated with a subjec tive experience of unity along the lines of Newberg and d'Aquili s theory of fronto-parietal networks in religious experience. The orbitofrontal activation is associated with a pleasant feeling during the mystical experience, while the anatomical structures insula and caudate nucleus are interpreted as the neural correlates of unconditional love and feeling of happiness which, according to the Carmelite nuns' self-reports, is characteristic of mystical experience. Unfortunately, the study suffers from both methodological and analytical problems. Beauregard and Paquette did not measure on actual mystical experi ence. Instead they measured the recall of a mystical experience because the Carmelite nuns considered it impossible to reach a true mystical experience since "God can't be summoned at will" (Beauregard and Paquette 2006: 187). Thus, it is unclear what the results actually showed. The theoretical premise of the study is that the participants are able to simulate or re-experience this unique state in the scanner. What that means exactly is neurophenomeno logically uncertain. This premise makes it difficult to claim ecological validity in spite of post-scan questionnaires suggesting a certain extent of experiential authenticity (Beauregard and Paquette 2006: 187). Furthermore, the length of recall was five minutes which is difficult to con trol experimentally especially because the target condition in this study lacks precise instructions and support from external stimuli (e.g., visual screen or headphones). It is uncertain whether participants were able to stay focused on the task throughout the entire epoch. Perhaps the multitude of activations in Beauregard and Paquette's study suffer from the noise of irrelevant thoughts and might therefore not relate to the target condition, namely, the simulation of mystical experience. In their discussion Beauregard and Paquette mostly refer to literature on complex cultural phenomena rather than basic research on cognitive func tions. The observed activity in the caudate nucleus, for example, is interpreted as the neural correlate of unconditional love by reference to an earlier study of love (Bartels &amp; Zeki 2000, 2004). However, the underlying function of the caudate nucleus (dorsal striatum) in love presumably has to do with reward learning and forming habits in social interaction (Delgado 2007; Gerdeman et al. 2003; King-Casas et al. 2005). When Beauregard and Paquette refer to studies of complex cultural phenomena rather than basic brain function, the uninformed reader may come to believe that these brain regions are specifi cally involved in that particular phenomenon. Caudate activity in love (Bartels &amp; Zeki), temporal lobe activity in a "felt" presence of supernatural beings</page><page sequence="18">U. Schjoedt / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 327 (Persinger), and parietal deactivations in a transcendental unitary experience (Newberg and d'Aquili), probably subserve these phenomena as basic compo nents, e.g., reward processing, linguistic processing, semantic or episodic pro cessing, visuo-spatial processing, somato-sensory processing, etc. In this light, Beauregard and Paquette's interpretations may be overly ambitious. Their conclusion that mystical experience is a complex phenomenon which recruits many brain regions and processes seems reasonable. This hypothesis separates itself from other studies reviewed in this article which work with the hypothesis that specific systems or processes underlie a uniform category of religious experience. However, instead of analyzing the mental composition of mystical experience in Carmelite nuns by reference to basic cognitive process ing, Beauregard and Paquette refer to studies on complex experiences like love, sense of a felt presence, and dissolution of the self/other dichotomy. This weakness in their interpretation together with the problematic premise of recalled mystical experience leaves Beauregard and Paquette's findings in the midst of unanswered questions. Although the study is explorative and there fore not confined by strict hypotheses, the methodological and analytical issues make Beauregard and Paquette's results inconclusive and in great need of further testing. VIII. Formalized and Improvised Prayers The last line of research presented is our project at the University of Aarhus which uses fMRI to investigate the neural changes in response to different forms of praying, e.g., personal prayer, formalized prayer, and intercessory prayer. This project takes its point of departure in the general assumption in the comparative study of religion that religious practice and experience encompass an enormous variety of diverse thoughts and behaviour. This has been demon strated by psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, and scholars of religion who have produced numerous typologies on different forms of religious expression (James 1902; Weber 1904; Durkheim 1912, Berger 1967; Geertz 1973; Waardenburg 1973; Whaling 1983-84; Braun &amp; McCutcheon 2000; Antes et al. 2004, and many others). As demonstrated, the assumption that religion varies substantially within and between individuals and cultures is rarely entertained in the experimental neuroscience literature. The various lines of research reviewed above have mainly held the hypothesis that reli gious experience is fundamentally a uniform category of human experience (Persinger 1987; d'Aquili &amp; Newberg 1999; Azari et al. 2001; Previc 2006).</page><page sequence="19">328 U. Schjoedt / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 Even though each of the projects proposes different hypotheses on the neural substrates of religious experience, they generally agree on the uniformity of this broad phenomenon. Persinger thus claims that the felt presence of a supernatural being, and perhaps even the origin of religion, is caused by a specific pattern of transient electrical impulses in the temporal lobe (Persinger 1987; 2001), and d'Aquili and Newberg hypothesize that the transcendental experience oÃ­ absolute unitary being is caused by specific neural processes in the fronto-parietal networks (d'Aquili &amp; Newberg 1999). In our study we generally interpret religious thoughts and actions in accor dance with the broader theoretical framework of the brain's functional organ isation. Akin to the idea that cognitive processing relies on the same regions as perception and action (Barsalou 1999; Damasio 1994; 1999; Rizzolatti &amp; Craighero 2004), we assume that complex cultural phenomena such as reli gious practices are subserved by the basic processing of our biologically evolved dispositions, e.g., sensory-motor activities, reward processing, and social cog nition (Boyer 2003; Schjoedt 2007). Thus, our aim is not to map the neural correlates of the mystical or transcendental in religious experience but to describe the basic neural processing employed by religious subjects in various religious practices. In our experimental design (Schjoedt et al. 2009), we implemented a par ticularly strong typology that categorizes religious behaviour in two different domains containing either formalized or improvised forms of expression (Weber 1904). Although this dual typology is reductionist in scope, it has survived scientific scrutiny for more than a century and is still being employed by top researchers in the field of cognitive anthropology and the cognitive sci ence of religion (Whitehouse 2004; McCauley and Lawson 2002). We do not argue that formalized and improvised forms of religion are essential categories with distinct and uniform neural correlates, but we do agree that this distinc tion is observable in the ethnographic and psychological data and therefore worthy of investigation. According to this general typology religious practice can be divided into two different categories depending on their structure: (a) a highly formalized mode of religion which consists of rigidly performed rituals and prayers and (b) an improvised mode consisting of non-institution alized and low-structured practices. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how the performance of formalized and improvised forms of praying changed the evoked BOLD response in a group of twenty young Christians belonging to the Inner Mission, a fraction of the Danish Lutheran Church known for its orthodox views. We used the Lord's Prayer as a highly formalized prayer and Personal Prayer as an improvised prayer. Praying comprises multiple subgenres</page><page sequence="20">U. Schjoedt / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 329 and varies tremendously in form and content within and between cultures (Geertz 2008). We therefore expect that praying, like other forms of mental practice, differs widely in both cognitive content and corresponding neural correlates. Specifically, we hypothesized that social cognition and its neural substrates are particularly active in improvised prayers where religious subjects converse with a god believed to be real and capable of reciprocating personal requests (Schjoedt et al. 2009). We used a well-known rhyme of own choice to control for the effects of formalization and wishes to Santa Claus to control for the effect of improvisation. We then contrasted the four conditions in a two-by-two design and further introduced a linguistic, non-semantic base line (counting backwards from 100). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN DOMAIN SPEECH ACT Religious Secular Formalized The Lord's Prayer Nursery Rhyme Improvized Personal Praying Making wishes to Santa Claus IX. Social Cognition The contrasts between the individual conditions revealed a specific pattern of neural activity in personal praying relative to making wishes to Santa Claus as well as to the Lords Prayer, which consisted of the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), the temporoparietal junction, and the temporopolar region. These regions together are sometimes called the classic "theory of mind" areas in social cognition which refers to the regions' involvement in thinking about other persons' intentions, beliefs, and desires (Gallagher and Frith 2003; VÃ´llm et al. 2006). Studies have shown that subjects playing reciprocity games against computers or abstract entities and humans recruit the anterior MPFC and the temporoparietal junction specifically for "human" interaction (McCabe et al. 2001; Gallagher et al. 2002; Rilling et al. 2004). We argue that this pattern of activation in Personal Praying suggests that talking to God who is considered "real" rather than "fictitious" like Santa Claus is comparable to normal interpersonal interaction. This finding is not only interesting for the social cognitive and affective neuroscience and the cognitive science of religion. It also offers important insights to the study EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN DOMAIN SPEECH ACT Religious Secular Formalized The Lord's Prayer Nursery Rhyme Improvized Personal Praying Making wishes to Santa Claus</page><page sequence="21">330 U. Schjoedt / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 of theology in which Christian doctrine on God's nature includes abstract concepts like God's omnipresence, omniscience, and omnipotence. Interest ingly, in terms of brain function, our results suggest that the IM participants mainly think of God as a person rather than as an abstract entity. This observa tion supports previous cognitive studies which have demonstrated that reli gious subjects are generally incapable of keeping a strict doctrinal representation of God in online cognitive processing. Christian subjects for example gener ally seem to answer questions about God's nature as if God is constrained by time and space like normal persons are (Barrett and Keil 1996). X- Habit Forming and Reward Processing Another important aspect of praying is the considerable time and energy that religious subjects spend on their prayers, e.g., devoted Muslims prostrate five times a day in prayer (Rippin 2001:101). The actual practice seems to be cen tral to religious behaviour and cannot be separated from its other putative functions, e.g., dealing with epistemological questions or coping with chal lenges (Barsalou et al. 2003, 2005). Because of this we assumed an effect of praying in the dorsal striatum which is the dopaminergic system involved in motivating repeated behaviours (Delgado 2007). This function has been extended to the social domain in recent studies showing a relation between reward behaviours dependent on social trust in reciprocity games and activity in this system (King-Casas et al. 2005). Based on this prior hypothesis we made a region of interest analysis of the caudate nucleus, which is involved with instrumental reinforcement (Schjoedt et al. 2008). The regional analysis revealed a significant main effect of religious praying in the right caudate nucleus. This activation supports the hypothesis that religious prayer is capable of stimulating the dopaminergic system of the striatum in practicing individuals. In King-Casas et al. s study learning to trust partners in economic exchange games was predicted and mirrored by caudate activation. Our results suggest that intrinsic belief in God and a high confidence that God reacts to one's prayers may have similar effects on the dorsal striatum in praying subjects. This finding may provide valuable insight on how praying is reinforced at a neuronal level, and it could be a significant step towards understanding why devoted believers succeed in motivating a range of repeated behaviours. Habit ual praying, however, might divert from social reinforcement learning as reported by King-Casas et al. because subject-God reciprocity exclusively relies on the anticipation of future outcomes and interpretation of past events rather</page><page sequence="22">U. Schjoedt / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 331 than on concrete monetary rewards. Praying offers no immediate feedback, and trusting God does not depend on trivial trial and error learning (Schjoedt et al. 2008). A relevant approach to further examine the relation between the dorsal striatum and religious practice would be to study patients with infarcts or haemorrhages in this region. However, this approach requires a detailed bat tery of religiosity measures to separate habitual behaviours from socially dependant practices. To my knowledge, this has not yet been attempted. Another interesting approach is the study of religiosity in patients with Par kinson's disease (PD) which targets this region in order to examine how decreased dopamine levels affect religious practice. A pioneering study on this particular relation reported a significant difference between PD patients and a matched control group revealing a decrease in frequency of private practices like praying and meditation (McNamara et al. 2006). This finding supports our hypothesis that the motivational systems of the dorsal striatum may play an important role in motivating frequently repeated religious behaviours (Schjoedt et al. 2008). XI. Methodological Remarks Compared to previous studies in the field we increased the number of partici pants in our study, and we tried to attain maximum ecological validity by studying a religious practice which did not have to be re-experienced (Beaure gard and Paquette 2006) or induced by external stimuli (Persinger 1997). The two prayers were largely context-independent conditions because the partici pants were used to practicing both forms of praying in widely different con texts, e.g., at bedtime or while riding a bike (Schjoedt et al. 2009). Furthermore, our results are relatively robust (thresholded at p&lt;0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons), and our interpretations rely on conventional theories of brain function rather than on new claims about specific neural mechanisms (Per singer 1987, d'Aquili &amp; Newberg 1999) or on results from other studies of complex cultural phenomena (Beauregard and Paquette 2006). Finally, we examined two different forms of praying rather than solely contrast religious conditions relative to non-religious conditions. This is crucial for examining differences and commonalities in various religious practices. Our results suggest that for young Danish Christians of the Inner Mission, personal praying to God is fundamentally an intersubjective experience com parable to that of normal interpersonal interaction (Schjoedt et al. 2009). In addition to this finding both forms of praying seem to be motivated by the</page><page sequence="23">332 U. Schjoedt / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 dopaminergic reinforcement systems associated with habit forming and reward evaluation (Schjoedt et al. 2008). However, praying which lies at the centre of all religions, is a complex phenomenon including acts of individual prayer, collective prayer, intercessory prayer, ritual incantation, and meditative prayer, each of them having multiple subgenres (e.g., petition, hymns, worship, thanksgiving, confession, chanting) and demonstrating significant variance across cultural contexts (Mauss 1909). Further studies of other religious groups and other forms of praying are needed to grasp the differences and commonalities of this broad category of religious practice. One example of such study is our recently completed experiment on intercessory prayer where participants listened to prayers performed by persons with differing religious status. This study explores how assumptions about the praying speaker change the brain activity in secular and Christian participants who receive interces sory prayer. The hypothesis is that religious authority, especially charismatic authority (Weber 1904; 1922), depends on the participants' recognition of the authority as endowed with special powers. Participants who believe in healing miracles through intercessory prayer should therefore respond differ ently to persons who they believe have healing powers compared to persons who they believe are "ordinary" practitioners. In this study we use the partici pants' post-scan reports in the analysis of the brain data to correlate their subjective experience with specific brain processes. The intriguing results from this experiment are currently in preparation. Note that this study takes a con text-based approach which uses the participants' expectations in interpersonal interaction as a central factor in the experimental design (Roepstorff and Frith 2004). This approach aims at understanding how perceived religious cate gories affect neural systems rather than how neural systems affect religious categories. The study exemplifies a new direction in the social cognitive neu rosciences which stands in strong contrast to the standard cognitive science of religion which has mainly focused on mapping the cognitive and neural sys tems behind various religious behaviours and explaining religious phenomena as a function of specific cognitive mechanisms (Boyer 1994, 2003; Barrett 2004; Bering 2006; Whitehouse 2000; McCauley and Lawson 2002). XII. Concluding Remarks The aim of this article has been to give scholars of religion a sense of this field's limitations and potential. I have briefly introduced some of the standard pro cedures in cognitive experimental neuroscience, and I reviewed six lines of pioneering research on the relation between brain activity and religion which</page><page sequence="24">U. Schjoedt / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 333 use modern imaging technologies as the tool of choice. These are not the only projects investigating the neurobiological underpinnings of religion. There exists a large number of studies using EEG and neuroimaging on religiously inspired meditation techniques (Cahn &amp; Polich 2006), and a few studies which use clinical evidence from patients with various brain lesions (Ogata &amp; Miyakawa 1998; Ramachandran 1998; McNamara et al. 2006). In fact there are several papers and articles on the relation between religion and brain func tion, but the vast majority of these only includes theoretical considerations and indirect evidence on potentially relevant brain regions and functional sys tems (Saver and Rabin 1997; Boyer 2003; McNamara 2006; Wildman and McNamara 2008). The list of actual experiments is surprisingly short, and no one has yet examined the relation in a systematic way. There is little doubt that the experimental neuroscience of religion holds great potential, but it is clear from the studies reviewed that it also faces serious methodological and theoretical challenges. Some of these challenges are prob lems general to the experimental neurosciences. Issues with the data acquisi tion, data analysis, and critical assumptions on brain anatomy and brain function are problems common to most studies which use imaging technol ogy. It is reasonable to assume, however, that in time these issues will be reduced as developments in theory and methodology continue to improve. Such improvements need to be implemented in the experimental design and interpretation of the data in order to optimize future studies on religion. Other issues that need to be addressed which are more specific to the study of religion have been reviewed in a recent article by Wildman &amp; McNamara (2008). These include the relation between participants' subjective experience and underlying brain processes and the challenges of diversity and complexity of its subject matter. With regard to the former, future studies need to imple ment participants' behavioural data and subjective reports in their analysis of the brain data in order to make sure that the hypothesized relation between conscious experience and brain activity is significant. This is already being done in many social cognitive and affective imaging studies demonstrating rather convincing results as a consequence. With regard to the latter, religious practice and experience pervade the lives of billions but in many cultures there are no phenomenological equivalents to the Western concept of religious experience or the Eastern concept of meditation. Nevertheless, the majority of the studies reviewed in this article has investigated either of these two as religious experiences per se. This idea that religious and mystical experiences are uniform and well-defined categories is no longer viable in the comparative study of religion. The fact that studies still use such concepts may be due to religious agendas or cross-cultural ignorance. Unfortunately, such studies</page><page sequence="25">334 U. Schjoedt / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 have been the ones attracting the most attention in the media. The universal aspects of transcendental and mystical experience are more appealing to the general population than the diverse and basic processes employed by different forms of less striking practices, e.g., the daily recitation of the Lords Prayer. If the field wishes to obtain a proper scientific dialogue with the broader disciplines of neuroscience and the general study of religion, I believe two issues stand out as critical. First, it will be necessary for future studies to use well-established theories of brain function for interpretation rather than devel oping new controversial hypotheses on mechanisms supposedly unique to religious experience. Expert researchers of cognitive neuroscience today offer significant insights on the neural underpinnings of both basic and complex social behaviours. Experimental researchers of religion who often approach the study with mixed educational backgrounds should use these insights as a framework for interpretation rather than trying to expand on these by making new claims about neural mechanisms specific to religion. Second, experimen tal neuroscience must take the diversity of religious thought and behaviour into account in order to understand the complexity of religion and to give a realistic account of distinct religious practices and experiences. Beyond the fact that religious experience and practice across cultures all recruit various forms of "normal" cognitive processing (e.g., emotions, perceptions and actions), the only common feature that religious experiences and practices seem to share is an associated link to a supernatural instance. The cognitive underpinnings of this link are difficult to define because it varies from practice to practice, from person to person, and from culture to culture. The link is sometimes made implicit and sometimes explicit; it is sometimes concrete and sometimes abstract. It is uncertain whether we will ever find a common neural substrate of such diverse association. I therefore suggest that instead of spend ing enormous amounts of resources to pinpoint the neural substrate of a uni versal link to a supernatural instance, as exemplified by Newberg and d'Aquili's and Persinger's theories, the major challenge of the experimental neuroscience of religion should be to investigate how specific cultural traditions modulate the "normal" cognitive processes of the brain. This will undoubtedly lead to less exciting theories and less spectacular results, but it will also contribute to a more sober discussion which in turn will make it more useful for the aca demic study of religion. By implementing new research paradigms from the social cognitive and affective neurosciences, and using the latest methods and theories in conven tional brain science, researchers should soon be able to reach a new milestone in the neuroscience of religion, where the results offer robust and credible evidence on the neural substrates of various religious phenomena. The evi dence that I have introduced and reviewed in this article may pose too many</page><page sequence="26">U. Schjoedt / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 21 (2009) 310-339 335 issues for scholars of religion who already feel uncomfortable with the recent turn toward cognitive science in the study religion. From this perspective, the neuroscience project may be considered another attempt to reduce complex cultural phenomena to simple products of human biology. Indeed the experi mental neuroscience of religion as it stands is marred by reductionist theories and unsatisfactory accounts of supposedly universal religious phenomena. However, the suggested shift of focus to how diverse cultural traditions and practices modulate the already known cognitive systems of the brain may rep resent a compromise, a sweet spot for future research, where comparative scholars and cognitive scientists alike could benefit from experimental neuro science. This approach may contribute to the comparative study of religion with important insights regarding how culture-specific beliefs influence reli gious behavior, and on the differences of how believers with diverse cultural backgrounds react to traditional and charismatic authorities in religious inter actions. With our project in Aarhus we attempt to move the field in this direc tion by investigating the basic neural processes employed in various forms of religious practice, and to examine how different cultural backgrounds change the brain response to various religious practices.
