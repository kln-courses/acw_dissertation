<plain_text><page sequence="1">Visvar?pa Vy?ha Avat?ra Reappraisals Based on an Inscribed Bronze from the Northwest Dated to the Early 5th Century A.D. by Doris Meth Srinivasan with Lore Sander 1. The Problem (DMS) The hitherto unpublished bronze image in a private Asian collection is the first known example to bear an inscription giving the identification of a well recognized but problematic type (Fig. 1) (x). That, together with the fact that the image can be accurately dated, distinguishes the bronze. For the problem raised by this vaisnava type deals precisely with its identification, its theological meaning, and its chronological development in religion and art. The type features a male deity with multiple heads and arms. The central head is human and the side heads are of a lion {simha) and a boar (var?ha). The earliest examples, both from the Gangetic Valley and the Northwest, show only these three heads ? as does our bronze. From the 9th century onwards (perhaps even earlier), a fourth head is added in back of the human head in examples from Kashmir. Four arms customarily belong to the central figure; the natural hands hold the conch and lotus, while the two extra hands rest on the god's attributes, namely the mace and the wheel. These attributes become personified sometime during the Gupta period as Gad?devi and Cakrapurusa, respectively (2). Scholarly reference to the visually unmistakable type is far from uniform. It has been called Visnu Catur?nana ('four-faced') whether the image has four faces (3) or (*) Research for this paper was made possible by a grant in 1991 from the Asian Cultural Council, to whom I express thanks for their support. Sincere thanks and appreciation go to Professor Gerard Fussman for going through an earlier draft of this paper and raising significant questions, consideration of which improved the arguments presented in the paper. I also wish to thank Professor Dennis Hudson for reading a draft of this manuscript and providing thoughtful discussion on the P?ncar?tra belief system. (2) See W. Begley, Visnu's Flaming Wheel: The Iconography of the Sudarsana-Cakra, New York 1973, pis. 5-1. (3) E.g. P. Pal, Bronzes of Kashmir, New York 1975, pi. 9: re a 9th century Kashmiri representation.

It has been called Visnu Caturm?rti ('having four forms') when the image has one body with four heads and arms, a label considered by some to be almost synonymous with Visnu Catur?nana (5), but by others to be almost synonymous with, or expressive of Visnu Caturvy?ha ('four [successive, cosmic] emanations') (6). It has been called 'Vaikuntha' (literally 'the keen, the penetrating irresistible') because the c. 8th century Visnudharmottara Pur?na (III.85.43-45), a Kashmiri text, calls the composite, four-faced type by this name; but the same text does not assign the name 'Vaikuntha' to a four-faced, eight-armed god seated on Garuda (III.44.9-13) which is the form receiving the name 'Vaikuntha' in the later P?ncar?tra texts (7). It is apparent that no scholarly consensus exists on when to apply this name. Indeed, scholars designate examples from Kashmir, and from all over India, by the name 'Vaikuntha' regardless of their anachronistic positions vis-?-vis the Visnudharmottara and posterior texts, and, regardless whether these examples are three-faced (8), four faced (9), or whether they include Garuda (10). There is consensus that the type expresses beliefs of the P?ncar?tra sect within Vaisnavism. The name a scholar assigns to the type invariably reflects which P?ncar?tra beliefs he attributes to the type. The sect believes in one Supreme, transcendental great Being (mahdpurusa) who represents cosmogonic totality (n). This is N?r?yana. (4) E.g. J.

Sivaramamurti and von Schroeder. It must be mentioned that ViDhP 3.85.43-45 which cites Vaikuntha contains areas of ambiguity. Vaikuntha is four-faced and has one form, or body (43); he becomes caturm?rti or four-formed (fourfold) when four faces are made (44a). This comment could lead to the supposition that a Vaikuntha could have less than four faces. Indeed, 44b and 45 go on to mention only three faces, namely, the saumya (eastern), the simha (southern), and the raudra (western) faces. (9) E.g. Maxwell, 'Vaikuntha', cit., figs. 2-5, 7-10.

That manifestation is called Para V?sudeva. Cosmogony continues as Para V?sudeva differentiates himself into four emana? tions (caturvy?ha). The first is vy?ha V?sudeva, who may be distinguished from Para V?sudeva (12). The three subsequent and successive vy?has are: Samkarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. The four vy?has head the cosmogonic process. They initiate pure creation which is the creation of all divine forms. All deities other than the vy?has are vihhava or avat?ra deities and they belong to the subsequent stage in the process of pure creation. Thus the names Catur?nana, Caturm?rti and Vaikuntha permit, either directly or by default, that the type could be interpreted according to the avat?ra doctrine, since the lateral heads showing the lion and boar, could be taken to represent two of Visnu's avat?ras. Only the name Caturvy?ha insists that none of the heads are primarily avat?ras but must primarily symbolize emanations (vy?has). Specifically, the lateral heads are understood to refer to the second and fourth vy?ha. If the four heads Fig. 1 - Para V?sudeva-N?r?yana. 427 A.D. Himachal Pradesh. Private Collection. correspond to the four vy?has, the type relates to the essential nature of N?r?yana, being manifest totality, as it were. If the heads are identified as avat?ras, then the type must belong to the lower, secondary level of pure creation, containing incarnations that are partial aspects of god. The theological significance of the side heads has consistently confounded art historical interpretations^even though J.N. Banerjea provided a cogent methodology (12) Schr?der (P?ncar?tra, cit.y p. 53) writes that Para V?sudeva is sometimes identified with, and sometimes distinguished from Vy?ha V?sudeva. Gupta's overview on this point (see 'P?ncar?tra Attitude', cit.y pp. 226-27) emphasizes their distinctions. [3] 107</page><page sequence="4">in perhaps the earliest serious consideration of the type (13). Summarizing the details on Vaikuntha from the Visnudharmottara Pur?na (111.85) (14), he joins that description to two other relevant passages elsewhere in the same text (111.47, especially verse 10 wich describes the four vy?has, V?sudeva, Samkarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, and III.44.11-12 which places the saumya face to the front or east, the face of Narasimha to the south, that of Kapila to the west and Var?ha to the north). Coordinating the data results in the following disposition: the front or eastern (human/saumya) face is that of V?sudeva, the right or southern face (lion) is that of Samkarsana, the back or the western one (kapila or raudra, the terrific) is that of Pradyumna, and the left or the northern one (the boar) is that of Aniruddha. Banerjea concludes, The lion- and the boar-faces are thus primarily associated with the P?ncar?tra Vy?has and not the Nrsimha and Var?ha incarnations, though the latter might have helped to some extent the formation of this concept' (15). De Mallmann unequivocally agrees with Banerjea's conclusion, '[...] il parait certain qu'? l'origine, la forme et la representation de Visnu aux quatre faces ont illustre les Quatres Grandes Manifestations' (i.e. Caturmah?vy?ha), 'en une seule personne [...]; les faces animates ne seront que tardivement assimilees aux Avat?ra [...]' (16). She makes this observation in connection with her analysis of Agni Pur?na, 49.21-23. This pur?nic section contains a description of Visnu Visvar?pa whom de Mallmann considers to be a syncretic aspect of the Caturvy?ha forms of Para V?sudeva (17). These arguments convinced Gonda. He associates the four faces of the early medieval Kashmiri images, which include lateral animal heads, with the four vy?has and he considers the type to represent the idea of 'One in Four' (18). I, too, was persuaded that these Kashmiri images express the vy?ha, and not the avat?ra doctrine when I first analyzed the iconography pertaining to the Caturvy?ha belief. I refrained from designating the Kashmiri images as 'Caturvy?ha' images, mainly because they do not feature the effective separation of the One into Four, but rather the inherent capacity for the One with four forms (i.e. Caturm?rti) to do so (19). Different views of the side (13) In the overview that follows, I am considering only studies deemed seminal from the methodological point of view. (14) Contents of the relevant sections are in n. 8. (15) Banerjea, Hindu Iconography, cit., p. 409. To avoid confusion, it may be best to remind that Banerjea seems to have switched the positions of the last two vy?has when, in the sentence preceding the quote, he situated Pradyumna in the northern and Aniruddha in the western directions.

The same paper includes those early icons I deem expressive of the orderly arrangement (lit. vy?ha-) pertaining to the cosmic emanation. They are: Fig. 108 [4]</page><page sequence="5">heads are represented by the works of Adalbert J. Gail and Thomas S. Maxwell. Gail mentions that the P?ncar?tra texts describe the vy?has as four distinct anthropomorphic entities, an observation leading him, no doubt, to consider as avat?ras the lateral boar and lion heads in the Gupta three-faced images from Mathur? in the Gangetic Valley. However Gail should have considered the evidence from the Gupta P?ncar?tra text, the Jay?khya Samhit?, which mentions animal heads in a context highly suggestive of a vy?ha description (see section VI). The Kashmiri four-faced type, according to Gail, adds yet another avat?ra head. But Gail hesitates to advance a hypothesis for understanding the resultant Kashmiri figure: 'This four-faced Visnu might have been interpreted by several P?ncar?trin as a representation of their four vy?has, but not even that is to be verified on the basis of one single Vdh. verse' (20). Maxwell considers the side heads as avat?ras; indeed he considers all the four heads as avat?ras. However he asserts that they are to be understood as avat?ras in terms of P?ncar?trin ideology, and not primarily in terms of the avat?ra doctrine. Maxwell explains that in the P?ncar?trin system each vy?ha emanates specific vibhavas or avat?ras, and he refers the reader to Schr?der's discussions of those P?ncar?tra texts mentioning which avat?ras spring from which vy?has. Thus, he proposes 1) that the V?sudeva, Narasimha, Kapila and Var?ha avat?ra faces could be taken as visible, earthly manifestations of the four vy?has, and 2) that in the Kashmiri four-headed images, the 'avat?ras and their associated vy?has can be worshipped without the need of separate icons [...]' (21). The difficulty with his proposition is that the relevant P?ncar?tra texts, cited by Schr?der, do not distribute the heads, deemed by Maxwell to be avat?ra heads, among all the four vy?has; therefore it is misleading to suggest that the latter can be associated, in toto, with the former. Schr?der discusses three P?ncar?tra texts; two (the Visvaksena Samhit? and the Laksmi Tantra) claim that all the avat?ras spring from one vy?ha alone: Aniruddha. The third (P?dma Tantra) distributes the avat?ras over the four vy?has, but the text neither mentions the Kapila avat?ra, nor that this avat?ra (or any other raudra form) springs from the vy?ha Pradyumna. Into the web of the problem posed by this type, the inscription on the base of the hitherto unpublished bronze (Figs. 2-5) injects pertinent information. The inscription, dated to the early 5th century, states that the image is called 'N?r?yana'. Both the script and the icon can be assigned to the Northwest, but not to Kashmir. Accordingly, the inscribed bronze image is, to date, the earliest complete example of the vaisnava type found in the Northern areas 1) being approximately four hundred 25 in the present paper and the Sunga Caturvy?ha from Bhit?, Figs. 4-7 (State Museum, Lucknow No. 56.394).

This means that the earliest (three-headed) examples described below can be identified as mainly images of 'N?r?yana'; they come from the Northwest and the Gangetic area and date between the 3rd/4th century A.D.-7th/8th century. But the identification cannot be proffered without further discussion. N?r?yana is not a name previously assigned by any scholar to the early images of this type (22). Moreover, it is not at all obvious how a visible manifestation with multiple bodily parts can symbolize a transcendental Being. Therefore, the theological position of the type within the P?ncar?tra's system of cosmogony needs to be examined, and this is done subsequent to a close scrutiny of the inscription, and the technical as well as art historical analyses of the 'N?r?yana' bronze. (22) Maxwell comes close in connecting Jay?khya Samhit?, VI. 59-153 with the type and proposing that the icons would have been known as 'N?r?yana Visv?tman'.

The aksaras are engraved in the middle of the pedestal with the help of a sharply pointed instrument. Pointed aksaras are confined to metal inscriptions (i.a. the Sh?rk?t inscription, Table of Comparison, column 2), but even there they are rare. In India this practice is attested to in Kharosthi inscriptions from the time of the Kus?na rulers, as, for example, on the Kalaw?n copper-plate inscription (near Sirkap) (23), the Taxila silver scroll (24), and on the Wardak (Afghanistan) vase of the time of Huviska (25).

The arrangement of the inscription around the pedestal is rather strange. The following diagram may illustrate it: Back 5b Front It begins to the left of the front side which is split into two parts by the figure of the earth goddess arising from a lotus. The first line (front, left side, line 1) ends at the outspread right arm of the goddess (No. 1 in the diagram). The inscription is not continued on her left side, as expected, but around the corner on the right side of the pedestal (diagram, No. 2). The one ascending line on the left side of the goddess (front, right side) contains the end of the inscription (diagram, No. 5b) and is the continuation of the second line on her right (diagram, No. 5a; front, left side, line 2). In fact, it is not only the strange arrangement which can hardly be explained. The inscription raises several grammatical and syntactical questions which have to be commented. Therefore the following translation has to be regarded as being tentative.

It is a religious gift of ... the honorable [srt) Varis? (26). Commentary (21) There are some open questions concerning the reading, which is based on photos only, and the translation. To begin with the date of the inscription, there are two points which have to be discussed. The first concerns sa[m]vacchare trayo (front). The -m- in the ligature of the Middle Indie form for 'year' sa[m]vacchare (cf. Linguistic analysis, below) is not quite sure because it is partly engraved on the upper rim of the pedestal. Clearly readable is trayo which is unusual. One would expect the ordinal number trtiye (cf. divase pancami) or as in most inscriptions of the Kaniska and the Gupta era the numeric sign for three, but not the cardinal number. The second expression in question is the reading atra divase (rear). It is written in that portion of the inscription which is rather faint. Instead of atra one would expect su ti = sukla tithi (28), the bright half of the month, but in this type of Br?hmi script, typical for the Northwest of ancient India, A is clearly discernible from su, because of its prominent hook at the left side of its top (cf. Table of Comparison). Another argument against su ti is the close relationship in formulaic rendering of our inscription to that of the Kus?na inscriptions, in which the bright or the dark half of a month are not mentioned. In the ligature tra only t- is fairly sure. The subscribed -ra is very faint. [at](i)? instead of [atra] seems to be possible. But atra is more likely; it is not only preferable for the shapes of the aksaras suggest this reading, but also for atra divase occurs in Kharosthi inscriptions, e.g. the much sanskritized Sui Vih?r inscription (South West Pakistan), which is dated into the eleventh year of Devaputra Kaniska (29). S. Konow (30) explained atra as being an orthographical error or misunderstanding for ay atra (31) in the same manner as tatra is from tat. The normal (26) For a different translation of the last two lines cf. n. 46. (27) I am very thankful to Professor von Hin?ber who made many helpful suggestions. I also owe thanks to Professor Fussman who opened my eyes on several problems concerning the inscription.

The formula corresponds also to the Sanskrit asmim divase in the famous inscription from Dalpat-ki-Khirki Mohalla (Mathur?) dating of the year 14 of Kaniska (33). The formulaic rendering of the date of our inscription follows that of the Kharosthi inscriptions of the Kus?na period and not that of most of the Br?hmi inscriptions from Mathur? which is (et)asy?m p?rv?y?m (34), with the exception of the inscription of the year 14 of Kaniska. The names of places occurring in our inscription are bhim?sth?na and gharattamattha. Both places are difficult to locate. To begin with bhim?sth?na: The second member of the compound ?sth?na indicates a small place (35), most probably a holy place (ttrtha), not a village (gr?ma) or town (nagara). The name bhtm?? can be connected with the Devi, the highest sivaitic deity (36). In attempting to interpret the compound, the possibility that bhim?? could be an orthographic error for bhima? needs to be taken into consideration. In our inscription long and short vowels are not always distinguished according to the rules of classical Sanskrit (cf. Linguistic analysis, below). In the case of an orthographical error, bhima? may refer to the P?ndava hero of the Mah?bh?rata whose cult is and was very popular in the Northwest (37) (For literary evidence cf. Section IV, below).

The normal formula for Mathur? inscriptions is asy?m or etasy?m p?rv?y?m 'on this date' (Index: p. 224). (34) Cf. Th. Damsteegt, Epigraphical Hybrid Sanskrit, pp. 195 f. (35) D.C. Sircar (Studies in the Religious Life of Ancient and Medieval India, Delhi-Patna-Varanasi 1971, pp. 105-14) refers to an inscribed stone slab from a spring tank near Abbottabad in the Hazara District with a Br?hmi inscription dated 25 of an unknown era. Sircar dates it according to the Gupta era 344 A.D. The inscription refers to Kum?ra-sth?na which was caused to be made (k?rito kum?ra sth?nam). Sircar considers ?sth?na to be a temple. The meaning does not suit to bhim?-sth?na in our inscription, because bhim?-sth?na is a common name for holy places. In our inscription gharattamattha seems to be the locality in which the image found its home. (36) A late reference to a place named after the goddess bhim? (bhim?-devi) is mentioned in Kalhana's R?jatarangim (ed. M.A. Stein, Vol. I: Sanskrit Text with Critical Notes, Calcutta 1892 [repr. Delhi 1960], section II, p. 22, v. 135). This reference belongs to the chapter attributed to king Samdhimat, who was a devotee of Siva. He is one of those earlier kings not historically attested. Stein (Kalhana's R?jatarangim. A Chronicle of the Kings ofKasmir, transl. M.A. Stein, 2 vols., 1900 [repr. Delhi Patna-Varanasi 1961], Vol. I, p. 68, n. 135) identifies this place as being the modern Br?n (= Bhim?) in the northeast of Srinagar in Kashmir. He also refers to the Haracaritacint?mani of R?j?naka Jayaratha, a Kashmirian poet of approximately the same time as Kalhana, the 12th century A.D.: bhim?-devi \% described there as a tirtha where many austerities were performed.

If this point is not the original, the name must be read Vahlik?, but Vailik? seems to be more likely. The reading is not the only difficulty of this portion of the inscription. Professor Fussman drew my attention to the fact that in almost all Kus?na inscriptions the formula 'the image was installed' is connected with a person in the instrumental case. Because the ending of feminine ^-sterns -?y? often represents the instrumental (41) the translation could possibly be: 'on this day the image of N?r?yana was installed at Bhim?sth?na, in (or at) the Gharattamattha by Sri Vailik?'. Against his hypothesis speaks, besides the difficulty of having two donors, Vailik? and Varis?, that normally the name of the donor in instrumental case preceeds the announcement of the gift (42): 'by N.N. the image of N.N. (or another gift) was installed'. For syntactical reasons the lady Vailik? should be connected with gharattamattha, and -?y? should represent the genitive gender with omission of the Visarga. The origin of the name, whether read as Vailik? or Vahlik?, is likely Iranian (43), perhaps meaning 'the lady from Balkh (Baktria)'. In our inscription it is a personal (38) O. von Boethlingk, Petersburger W?rterbuch and M. Monier-Williams, Sanskrit-English Dictionary, where the reference does not agree with the editions of Stein (cf. n. 39). (39) Stein, Kalh?nas R?jatarangim, cit., Vol. II, 1900; chapt. VII: 1232, 1292, 1576. (40) It is tempting to understand ?mattha as ?matha, 'hut' or 'hermitage', but to explain the double ?ttha is difficult, except thinking of an orthographical mistake. For ?mattha being the pp. of mrj cf. T.W. Rhys Davids &amp; W. Stede, The Pali Text Society's Pali-English Dictionary, London 1921-1925 (repr. London 1979). See also H.D.T.

I thank Professor von Hin?ber for having drawn my attention to the most detailed linguistic study on B(V)ahlika and its various forms mainly in Indian, 118 [14]</page><page sequence="15">name, clearly indicated by Sri. It is not probable that the name refers directly to the original home-land of the lady (44). The name of the female donor of the Visnu bronze is Sri Varis?. Professor von but also in other sources: M. Witzel, 'Early Iran and the Atharvaveda', Persica, Jaarboek voor het Genootschap Nederland-Iran, Annuaire de la Societe Neerlando-Iranienne, IX, 1980, pp. 86-128. Among his quotations neither Vailik? nor Vahlik? occurs. Assuming the reading Vahlik? is correct, the wrong Visarga for the ligature hla cannot be explained by linguistic arguments. But, there exists an example for a misunderstood Visarga in the Ratnagiri inscription No. 5 dating from the late 6th century (cf. O. von Hin?ber, 'Epigraphical Varieties of Continental P?li from Devnimori and Ratnagiri', in Buddhism and Its Relation to Other Religions: Essays in Honour of Dr Shozen Kumoi on His Seventieth Birthday, Kyoto 1985, pp. 185-200, esp. p. 194). The preferable reading Vailik? may be explained with the help of the svarabhakti form Vahilik? with omission of the sonant h. But, in the light of the studies of S. Konow (Kharoshthi Inscriptions, cit., p. CXI) and Th. Damsteegt (Epigraphical Hybrid Sanskrit, cit., pp. 46 f.) sonant h is generally preserved in the Mathur? and Gandh?ra inscriptions of the Kus?na period with which our inscription, although younger, shares linguistic and formulaic peculiarities. Another Sanskrit origin for the name Vailik? is also possible: Vailik? = Vailik? from velik? (Skt. vela). For the change from -ai to -0/cf. Konow, Kharoshthi Inscriptions, cit., p. XCVI. (44) Despite the improbability that the name Vailik? refers directly to her homeland, the discussion about the localization of B(V)alhika is of interest to our inscription. K.Ch. Mishra ('B?lhika', Bh?rati. Bulletin of the College of Indology, Central Asian Number, ed. A.K. Narain, X/XI, 1966-1968, pp. 210-19) deals with the probable difference of the meaning of B?lhika, B?lhika and B?hlika. He states (p. 213): 'B?lhika really stood for a country distant from Kuru land, whereas B?lhika seems to be a later appellation for the whole of western Punjab and N.W. region when the population in these areas became largely mixed with foreign intruders (BahihY. He further quotes from the Mah?bh?rata (11.24.21) that 'the B?hlika country was conquered by Arjuna in the extreme northwest along with Darada, Kamboja etc' (p. 214). In a 5th century inscription from Chil?s-Terrace (Upper Indus Valley) a Dard king Vaisravanasena is mentioned (O. von Hin?ber, 'Br?hmi Inscriptions on the History and Culture of the Upper Indus Valley', in Antiquities of Northern Pakistan. Reports and Studies, Vol. 1: Rock Inscriptions in the Upper Indus Valley, ed. K. Jettmar, Heidelberg Academy for the Humanities and Sciences. Research unit: Rock Carvings and Inscriptions along the Karakorum Highway, Mainz 1989, pp. 57-59). Further informations about the Dards cf. Jettmar in the same volume, pp. XXXVII f. D.C. Sircar ('P?nch?la, K?mboja, B?hlika and P?ndu [P?ndya]', Bh?rati, pp. 3-6) tried to locate i.a. K?mboja and B?hlika on the basis of the late medieval work Saktisangama Tantra. He located B?hlika 'in the west of Northern Afghanistan' (p. 6). There is another controverse discussion about the homeland of the V?hlikas in context with the country conquered by Candra in the Mehrauli pillar inscription. S.R. Goyal {A History of Imperial Guptas, Allahabad 1967, p. 204, n. 2) summarizes the discussion as follows: 'So far V?hlikas are concerned S.K. Aiyangar, R.G. Basak and D.R. Bhandarkar etc. place them in the Punjab on the strength of a verse of the R?m?yana. But R.C. Majumdar ("The King Candra of the Meharauli Iron Inscription", JASB, IX, 1943, pp. 179 ff.) and D.C. Sircar (P.V. Kane Volume, Art. No. 64) have conclusively shown that V?hlikas, conquered by Chandra belonged to Baktria'. For further discussion cf. M.C. Joshi et al., eds., 'King Chandra and the Meharauli Pillar', in Kusumanjari, Problems of Indian History, Series No. 1, Meerut 1993. Cf. also R.C. Majumdar, History and Culture of Indian People.

JASB, Letters, Vol. IX, 1943, pp. 179 ff.'. This location possibly coincides with that of the tirtha bhim?-sth?na in the Mah?bh?rata, as located by Doris Srinivasan, Section IV, below. [15] 119</page><page sequence="16">Hin?ber (45) kindly informed me about the same name occurring in a graffito from Oshib?t, a place in the Upper Indus Valley. In this inscription the son of Upala-varis? announced his presence at this remote place (upala [skt. utpala]-varis?-putra) in one of the rare Hybrid Sanskrit inscriptions found in this area. However, the occurrence of the same name in two different inscriptions is not a proof for the identity of the ladies. The last peculiarity of our inscription concerns the devadharma formula at the end of the inscription. The reading ?yam in devadharmayam is not sure from the photo. There is just enough space for ?yam in front of the figure of the earth goddess. Conjecturing ?yam means that tya, the first aksara on the right side of the earth goddess, is isolated. But devadharmatya is not attested and gives no sense, despite one thinks of an elimination (46). Summarizing, the main difficulties of the inscription concern the part in the front of the pedestal. It is not only the strange arrangement on this side, but also the isolated tya in the devadharma formula (47) which suggests that this side may have been engraved from the same copy after the three others. It appears as if the engraver had difficulties to arrange the parts of the last portion of the copy on the front of the pedestal. Linguistic Analysis The inscription is written in a language named by Th. Damsteegt 'Epigraphical Hybrid Sanskrit'. It encompasses different grammatical forms resulting from the differing degree of Sanskritization of the inscriptions from the time of the Kus?nas. Although the language of our inscription is not G?ndh?ri, it shares some orthographic and formulaic pecularities with the Kharosthi inscriptions of this time. The use of the Middle Indie form samvacchare 'in the year' is rare, even in the Kus?na inscriptions. The Sanskrit equivalent is samvatsare which is the standard word in the (45) O. von Hin?ber, 'Zu einigen iranischen Namen und Titeln aus Br?hmi-Inschriften am oberen Indus', in Studia Grammatica Iranica. Festschrift f?r Helmut Humbach, ed. R. Schmitt &amp; P.O. Skjaervj?, M?nchen 1986, p. 147. Cf. also M. Bemmann &amp; D. K?nig, Die Felsbildstation Oshibat. Materialen zur Arch?ologie der Nordgebiete Pakistans, 1, ed. H. Hauptmann, Mainz 1994, p. 46, 13.1. (46) n- and t- are clearly discernible in this script (cf. Table of Comparison). Therefore the reading tya is the only possible. One may think of a substitution like devadharmaparityaga for ?parity?ga or simply ?ty?ga 'this is the bestowal of a religious gift' by (or of) Sri Varis?. (47) Professor Fussman mentioned that the devadharma formula generally stands at the beginning of inscriptions. For devadharma, deyadharma cf. O. von Hin?ber, 'Die Kolophone der Gilgit Handschriften', in Studien zur Indologie und Iranistik, Heft 5/6, Festschrift Paul Thieme, Reinbek 1980, p. 54. 120 [16]</page><page sequence="17">Mathur? inscriptions, while in the Kharosthi inscription samvatsare is preferred (48). According to von Hin?ber (49) the change of tsa (also tsa; the author) to ccha is well attested in Middle Indian languages and is only a writing variant (50) for the same or very similar sounds (51). Other influences in our inscription are common to Kharosthi inscriptions from the times of the Kus?nas, as the formulaic date ending with atra dwase (see 'Commentary'). Furthermore, compared with the correct Sanskrit forms short and long vowels are often confused which is characteristic for the 'Epigraphical Hybrid Sanskrit', a stands for -? (cf. as?dha for Sanskrit ?s?dha, masa for m?se (52), pratitthdvita for pratisth?pit? (53), devadhannayam for devadharm?y?m), and -f is used instead of -/ in dwase (54). The ending of the loc. sg. -/ pancami for (48) Forms like samvacchara are seldom attested, and no example is known to me written with the ligature -mva for anusv?ra (cf. L?ders, Mathur? Inscriptions, cit.y ? 14, p. 73 [savacar?]; for late examples cf. D.R. Bhandarkar, 'A List of Inscriptions of Northern India in Br?hmi and Its Derivative Scripts, from about 200 A.C.', in Appendix to Epigraphia Indica and Records of the Archaeological Survey of India, Vols. XIX-XXIII, repr. Delhi 1983, No. 578; Sircar, Indian Epigraphy, cit., p. 327). Three further examples are present in Mathur? inscriptions from the Kus?na times: one (svarvacchara) is occurring in an inscription of uncertain origin dating 299 of a disputed era (cf. R.D. Banerji, The Scythian Period of Indian History', The Indian Antiquary, XXXVII, 1908 [repr. Delhi 1985], pp. 33-35; G. Fussman, 'Nouvelles inscriptions Saka: ere d'Eucratide, ere d'Azes, ere Vikrama, ere de Kaniska', BEFEO, LXVII, 1980, p. 42; G. von Mitterwallner, Kus?na Coins and Kus?na Sculptures from Mathura, Government Museum, Mathura, Growse Memorial Lectures 4, Mathura 1986, pp. 62-64. Von Mitterwallner accepts the reading 199 which, as to my knowledge of number signs, is not correct. A little stroke added to the right of the vertical is visible which indicates the 200). The second (sav?char?) is copied by Fussman (1980, pp. 5-25) from an unpublished stone slab in the Russek collection; and the third samvactare is written on a pillar from Govindnagar (Mathur?) dating to the 12th year of devaputra Kaniska (R.C. Sharma, Buddhist Art from Mathur?, Delhi 1984, fig. 13, the same von Mitterwallner, Kusana Coins, cit., p. 70). For general discussion cf. Damsteegt, Epigraphical Hybrid Sanskrit, cit., pp.' 192 ff.

Analysis of the Script (see Table of Comparison') Our inscription (column 1) is written in a northwestern Gupta variety, similar to that of the Buddhist Sarv?stiv?da inscription (column 2) found at Sh?rk?t (57), near the banks of the river Chen?b north to Mult?n in ancient Panjab, modern Pakistan (58), on one of the old roads to Kashmir following the river Chen?b. The inscription is incised round the shoulder of a copper cauldron in the same pointed technique as used for our bronze. The Sh?rk?t inscription is dated into the year 83, which was assigned by J.Ph. Vogel (59) to the Gupta era, corresponding to 403 A.D. Opposite to our inscription, it is composed in a fairly good Sanskrit. The main difference of letters is the form of the medial vowel -?, which, in the inscription under examination, is always added to the top, while in the Sh?rk?t inscription it is added to the right side (Prstham?tra) of those M?trk?s and ligatures having a triangle-shaped head (cf. c?, tth?, r?), and also m?. This is hardly an indicator for the age. -? was added to the right side of most of the M?trk?s already in the Kus?na era(60). The aksaras in the third column belong to two Mathur? inscriptions of the time of Kum?ragupta I, dated into the Gupta years 107 and 135 (427/28 and 455/56 A.D.) respectively (61). The two inscriptions are composed in classical Sanskrit. Most of the aksaras show a close affinity to those of our inscription. The main differences (55) Konow, Kharoshthi Inscriptions, cit., p.

The inscription of Toram?na in column four belongs to the late 5 th century A.D. It was found in Kur?, Salt Range, Punjab (Pakistan) (62). It is written in a Prakitized Sanskrit. Although it has many similarities with our inscription ? e.g. the same shape of A ? there are some differences also in comparison with the inscriptions already examined: the waved form of -e (de), and the cursive form of sa; the aksara la, the vertical of which does not rise above the upper line of the other M?trk?s. Such differences point towards a later state of development. The Kur? inscription shares these features with the script of the Kashmirian Bower manuscript ? especially with the script of parts V-VII ? which draws the line between the northwestern Gupta script and the more elaborate 'Siddham?trk?' or 'Kutila' type (63) occurring in India for the first time in the middle of the 6th century A.D. For paleographic reasons our inscription should be earlier than the Kur? inscription. The paleographic analysis leaves no doubt about the 5th century as being the time when our inscription was written. Date and Location According to the Script The inscriptions in the 'Table of Comparison' give not only an idea about the approximate date of our inscription but also about the possible area of origin of our bronze. Except for the inscriptions from Mathur?, all other examples belong to the northwestern frontier of ancient India. Especially characteristic for this region is the A with the pronounced hook. This is also found on several graffiti of the Upper Indus Valley, examples from them are joined to the Table of Comparison' (column 5) (64). (62) G.

[19] 123</page><page sequence="20">Two possible eras come into question for our inscription: it is the Gupta era beginning with 320/21 A.D. and the Laukika of Saptarsi of the lost 100. If we date our inscription according to the Gupta era, the year 3 coincides with 323/24 A.D. This is not in accordance with the paleographical evidence which points, as detailed, to the 5th century. As to the Saptarsi era its date can be calculated as follows: Year 3 + [4]00 + 24 (65) = 427 A.D. (66) The day of the week is missing. Therefore the exact date cannot be ascertained. Professor Claus Vogel from the University of Bonn was so kind to calculate the possible days on the basis of the P?rnim?nta and the Amanta systems. It is Wednesday, the 15th of June for the light {sukla, su ti) half of the month, for the dark half (bahala, ha ti) it is Tuesday, the 31st of May in the P?rnim?nta system, and Thursday the 30th of June in the Am?nta system. According to this date the N?r?yana bronze was installed at Bhim?sth?na in (or at) the Gharattamattha of the honorable Vaf(h?)lik? at the 15th or 31st of May or the 30th of June 427 A.D. respectively, this means in the golden age of the Gupta empire under Kum?ragupta I. The formulaic similarities of expressing the date, the language, and also the technique of engraving with the help of a pointed instrument, all this reminds of Kharosthi inscriptions from the late Kus?na period. This script was already on the retreat in the Indian subcontinent during the reign of the Gupta kings, who favoured the classical Sanskrit written in various forms of Br?hmi script. The Br?hmi of our N?r?yana bronze is characteristic for the northwestern provinces. But not only for those. The northwestern Gupta Br?hmi was in use in the valleys of the Him?layas as far as Ladakh, where graffiti of approximately the same time were discovered (67). Moreover, it spread north up to Merv and east up to Xinjiang (68). This type of script in combination with linguistic and formulaic rendering to inscriptions from the late Kus?na period at a time, when on the Indian subcontinent classical Sanskrit was on advance, suggests a remote region in the Northwest of ancient India as being the place of origin of our N?r?yana bronze. It is corroborated by the name of the place Bhim?sth?na, and also by the Iranian names of the two ladies. Technical and stylistic analyses have to define from where our bronze comes. (65) Cf. F.

Descriptive Analyses A. Technical Considerations (DMS) The following discussion on the technical aspects of the 'N?r?yana' bronze is based on visual assessments rather than laboratory testing (69); the latter is not deemed necessary because the physical properties that can be visually ascertained appear to be unproblematic. The composition of the 'N?r?yana' bronze is copper to which tin has been added. Moreover, it looks to be a high tin bronze. This metal alloy is prevalent in Gandh?ra copper-based sculptures. For example, about 70% of the Gandh?ra copper-based sculptures in the recent exhibition 'The Crossroads of Asia' have tin added (70). A copper object with a high tin content may also be found further afield to judge from a bronze vase in the same exhibit; it is the 1st century B.C. vessel found in Himachal Pradesh whose silvery appearance and brittleness suggest a high tin content (71). Few Kashmiri bronzes are of high tin content, '[...] technical studies of 60 Kashmiri sculptures of the medieval period showed that only 22% had added tin [...] This is in strong contrast to 90% of contemporary sculptures with added tin contents [...]' (72). Copper could have been mined in the northern areas but tin had to be imported. Small copper deposits can be located in Gilgit and Swat (73); however no early mine workings have been reported from northern Pakistan and probably copper was imported from Afghanistan in the pre-Islamic period (74). Kashmir seems to have had sizeable copper deposits along the Valley's western periphery (75). Copper mining is also recorded in Himachal Pradesh (76). Sources for tin would come from Afghanistan or India (77). Importation of tin into the Gandh?ran region probably was from Afghanistan rather than India; if the source were India then Kashmiri sculptures (69) The visual assessments benefited from a discussion with Dr Chandra L. Reedy, who was also good enough to send me the pre-publication paper mentioned in n. 74. (70) Crossroads of Asia, cit., Technical Analysis by Ch. Reedy, p. 244. (71) Ibid., No. 163, p. 162.

[21] 125</page><page sequence="22">Fig. 6 - Back view of Fig. 1. ought to have made more use of tin as an alloy in their bronzes. It still needs to be determined, however, whether or not the region of Himachal Pradesh, below Kashmir, received tin from Indian mines. Another technical feature of the 'N?r?yana' bronze reduces the probability that it comes from Kashmir. The hole seen in the back of the head (Fig. 6) is present in almost all bronzes attributed to northern Pakistan (though not actually found in excavations). Whereas about 95% from northern Pakistan show this hole, about 20% from Kashmir do. Too few icons from-Himachal Pradesh or the Punjab predating the medieval period have been analyzed to provide a useful basis for a comparison of this feature. The hole is the result of a particular casting technique: a rod is put in the back of the head to stabilize the figure during the casting process. Next may be addressed the important question whether the four separate parts, comprising the entire image, go together. These parts are: the central figure, the two side figures and the pedestal. A close-up view of a section of the base and the feet of the central figure show that the degree of corrosion is the same for both (Fig. 7). Further, the central figure appears to have been cast to fit well into the pedestal. The fit occurs under the thin platform on which rest the feet of the central figure. Posts, attached under the platform, fit into holes in the base. It is hard to cast pieces to fit exactly into holes in a base. Therefore if the central figure (and also the side figures) were not originally conceived for this particular pedestal, the joinings would be ill-fitting. Corroboration that the figures belong together comes from stylistic comparison contained in Section III.B; these comparisons strongly suggest that the central figure and the two side figures are a unit. Lastly, the pedestal and the statue show similar remains of earth deposits, indicating that they were buried at the same time. Thus, on the basis of all these factors it can be assumed that the four parts of the image are the genuine pieces belonging to the original composition. 126 [22]</page><page sequence="23">Fig. 7 - Close-up of Fig. 1, showing a part of the base and feet of the central figure. B. Art Historical Analysis (DMS &amp; LS) The three separate figures stand on the same pedestal, showing Bh? Devi as she emerges from the pericarp of a flower (Fig. 1). The base measures 19 cm (w.) by 6.5 cm (ht.). 'N?r?yana', the central figure, is 34 cm (ht.). To his right and left stand, respectively, Cakrapurusa (12.5 cm in ht.) and GadadevI (11.5 cm in ht.); were the top of her gada not broken off, the entire figure of the goddess would probably measure around 12.5 cm and fit securely underneath the palm of the central figure. The iconography of the central deity conforms to the type as stated above (see Section I). The male deity stands authoritatively, with both feet equipoised on the thin platform whose posts insert into holes in the pedestal. His oval face looks youthful, having large, alert eyes under arched brows, a full mouth beneath a slight moustache, round cheeks and chin, a prominent, fleshy, nose and a distinct ?rn? gracing the smooth forehead. From the front, the eyes are the god's most distinctive facial feature; they are heavy lidded yet sufficiently open to disclose the entire pupil as well as the concave iris. From the side, the nose, especially the way it juts out from a receding [23] 127</page><page sequence="24">Fig. 8 - Side view of Fig. 1. brow and chin, becomes the most distinctive feature (Fig. 8). A crown, tied around the god's locks, has a diamond-shaped crest decorated with knobs at each of the four points *and in the center; the knobs are connected to each other and to the central one by raised radial and perimetral links. Profiles of the animal heads arise from 'N?r?yana's strong, straight shoulders, and extend up to the ornamented ears; the lion (simha) is on the right and the boar (var?ha) is on the left. The deity's bare torso, swelling softly, is marked by a clearly etched srivatsq emblem and two simple necklaces, one close to the throat, the other looped below the srivatsa. Armlets with discs circle under the armpits. The god's waist is well defined but the navel is not. Neither is there emphasis on the musculature of the chest or the upper abdominal area. The deity is four-armed. A rather long vanam?l?, composed of uncertain leafy buds or flowers, extends from the upper arms and reaches almost to the knees. From the front view of the image, it appears as if the natural and extra arms share the upper arm and bifurcate only at the elbows. The side view indicates that this is not quite the case since the upper arm already divides (but does not split) into two at the shoulder (Fig. 8). The natural right and left hands, adorned with plain double bangles at the wrists, bend up from the elbows and hold the lotus stalk and the conch, respectively. The extra hands spread downward to rest on the personified attributes. The right hand cups over the rim of the Cakraourusa's wheel; the left palm would have rested on the gada of the Devi, as indicated by the remains of the gada in the palm of the god (slightly visible in Fig. 6). The god wears a dhoti gathered by a round pin below the waist; folds descend on his left thigh and in between the legs. Drapery folds are indicated by thinly incised double lines as well as raised, curved ridges at the hemline below the knees. A twisted sash circles the hips; ending 128 [24]</page><page sequence="25">in a large knot and streamer on the left, the sash helps to secure the dhoti (see Figs. 1 and 6). Considering that the complete image is composed of three separate figures, each standing on a small platform that fits into the pedestal, it is reassuring to note that some of the same features of the central figure reappear in the ancillary, side figures. Cakrapurusa, standing with raised chin and arms folded across the chest, exhibits an equally short dhoti draped in much the same fashion as that of the central figure. Also similar are Cakrapurusa's full, fleshy features within the oval head. Gad?devi's facial features likewise conform to the general characteristics of the males. Her jewelry ? the simple necklace, armlets and bangles ? remind of those associated with the central figure. So too is her dhoti like his, being not only marked by the same type of drapery folds but also by the same evasive panel on each side at the hemline. These artistic considerations indicate that the three separate figures are likely to belong together. (An unattached, c. 10'' ht. Bh? Devi in The Kronos Collection serves notice that it is theoretically possible for this type of an image to be composed of four separate figures). The pedestal has a rectangular shape. It is quite simple and plain, having two mouldings on the top and again at the bottom. The inscription runs along its middle portion which is framed by upper and lower thin bands intermittently decorated with double vertical lines. This order, neatly maintained on all four sides of the base, may be conditioned by the dedication, inscribed on all the four sides. The image, to the contrary, is to be viewed mainly from the front; the back has received a minimum of artistic attention and is left in rough condition (Fig. 6). The style and iconography of the 'N?r?yana' bronze is eclectic. It intermingles characteristics found over a very large area and over several centuries. Some of facial characteristics illustrate this intermingling; the full, rounded features, the heavy lidded, open eyes with the depressed iris, and the oval-shaped head are not unlike early terracotta faces, allegedly from the Gangetic area (78). The way these features occur in early Gupta stone icons is faintly (perhaps fortuitously), evident in a recently published Mathur? relief of the 3rd/4th century A.D. (now housed in the Harn Museum of Art, University of Florida, Gainesville), depicting a three headed 'N?r?yana' (79) (Fig. 9). The moustache, absent on this Mathur? 'N?r?yana' and on all Gupta Visnu icons, is a Northwestern trait, and as such appears on our bronze. A similarly shaped moustache occurs on a head wearing a crown nearly identical to the one worn by 'N?r?yana' (cf. Figs. 10-11). The shape and decoration of 'N?r?yana's crown are (78) A.G.

The head, offered for sale in the 1988 Spinks' Catalogue, seems to be a metal mask. It has other similarities with the bronze 'N?r?yana'. Note the similarity in the shape and rendering of the eyes, the eyebrows, the nose, chin, ?rn? as well as the flat necklace ornamented with indented knobs. The many idiosyncratic similarities between the bronze 'N?r?yana' and the head from Spinks' convince me that the Spinks' head should also date to the 5th century and originate from an area near to the bronze 'N?r?yana' (see Section IV) (80). A Gangetic element seen on Gupta Visnus (81) as well as our central (80) Based on the decorative device in the crown, perhaps the bronze Avalokitesvara (P. Pal, The Ideal Image, New York 1978, No. 70, p. 117), could be assigned to the same region, but a somewhat later date. The center diamond of a three-peaked tiara on the Bodhisattva shows essentially the same device. Pal rightly expresses doubt that the bronze's provenance is Swat, its reputed findspot. Noting too many Gupta Gangetic stylistic features, he gives a date of 600 A.D. and leaves the question of provenance open. On the basis of the finding in the current paper, the date and provenance of this Avalokitesvara may be reevaluated. (81) See for example J.G. Williams, The Art of Gupta India, Princeton 1982, pi. 54. [27] 131</page><page sequence="28">figure, is the twisted sash, knotted generously on the left. Its source is to be found in the pre-Gupta art of Mathur? (82). Also, the rendering of the four arms in our 'N?r?yana' bronze reflects a trend underway in the art of Mathur?. In Mathur? art of the early Gupta period, the extra arms can bifurcate either at the shoulder, or at the elbow (83), or as the Florida 'N?r?yana' shows, the arms can be divided (but not split) for a considerable length before bifurcating close to the wrists (Fig. 9). The divisions in arms of the Florida 'N?r?yana' from Mathur? and our Northern 'N?r?yana' may illustrate an early and a later tendency within the same trend. The pattern of the srivatsa symbol on 'N?r?yana's chest resembles most closely the srivatsa engraved on a Gupta bone seal from Rajghat (Varanasi, U.P.); in both cases, the configuration consists of an arrow-like, central upright flanked by devices resembling an 'S' and an inverted 'S' all of which rests on a double platform (Fig. 11) (84). The Rajghat seal does not exhibit the earliest vaisnava srivatsa in the Gangetic area. The symbol with a slightly different shape can be found on a vaisnava Kus?na relief from Mathur?, and in Gupta vaisnava contexts predating the 427 A.D. bronze 'N?r?yana' (85). Accordingly, both the style and usage of the srivatsa on the 'N?r?yana' bronze, where it seems to be the earliest Northern appearance of this symbol, is due to the Gangetic influences. Influence from the Gangetic Valley, specifically Mathur?, is again reflected in the way the conch is held. A late Kus?na Mathur? sandstone relief of four-armed V?sudeva-Krsna, now in the Museum f?r Indische Kunst Berlin (No. I 5878), is a rare early example still having intact the natural left hand holding the conch (86). The fingers of the left hand wrap around the conch and enter into the opening of the shell. This is the way the conch is held in our 'N?r?yana' bronze, as well as in a series of post-Gandh?ran stone sculptures of four-armed V?sudeva-Krsna, two of which can be assigned provenances. One comes from the Dharmar?jik? compound, Taxila, and the other from Bijbeh?ra, Kashmir (87); Paul dates both sculptures to the (82) S.J.

See figs. 2 and 7, but also fig. 3. 132 [28]</page><page sequence="29">6th century A.D. Early vaisnava images from the Northwest need not, however, hold the conch in this manner. A case in point is the famous 7th century Berlin three-headed, four-armed vaisnava image, which can now be called an image of 'N?r?yana' (Fig. 12) (88). Though the Berlin image shares essential iconographic similarities with our 'N?r?yana' bronze, it also shows numerous variations, one of which is the conch, cradled in a somewhat different manner. Also the Berlin 'N?r?yana' is brass, made mainly of a copper and zinc alloy (89), not copper and tin. Turning next to Cakrapurusa on our 'N?r?yana' bronze, it is seen that some of his iconographic traits also pertain to the Gangetic region. First, there is his unusual position to the right of the main figure. It is customary, in post Gandh?ran and Gupta representations for Cakrapurusa to stand to the left (90). However, a Gupta terracotta of a seated three-headed 'N?r?yana' from Mathur? shows Cakrapurusa to the right of the god (91). And the Florida 'N?r?yana' from Mathur? dating c. 3rd-4th century A.D. (Fig. 5) has the non-personified cakra to his right. Thus when this positioning occurs in the Northwest, as Fig. 12 - Para V?sudeva-N?r?yana. Beginning of the 7th century. Swat, Pakistan. Staatliche Museen zu Berlin ? Preussischer Kulturbesitz. Museum f?r Indische Kunst (124). it does in our bronze and in a British Museum image of V?sudeva-Krsna (92), we may be fairly certain that its occurrence is under the influence of Gupta India, (88) H.

(92) Paul, 'Early Kashmiri Visnu, cit., fig. 3, p. 834. [29] 133</page><page sequence="30">specifically Mathur?. Cakrapurusa's stance with folded arms equally reflects artistic influence from the southern regions. A quick comparison between Northern and Gangetic representations of the godling reveals that the pose seen on our bronze can at present be located in the 5th century art around Mathur? and Allahabad, and at the 6th century temple of Deogarh (93). The poised and peaceful mien of these Cakrapurusas contrast markedly with the agitated posture, open gestures and lively expression seen on the 7th century Cakrapurusa appearing in the Berlin 'N?r?yana', possibly from Swat (Fig. 12). But that is not to say that our 'N?r?yana' bronze is devoid of characteristics from the Northwest. Not at all. Compare, for example, the figure of Gad?devi to two small bronzes of females likely to come from Bannu (NWFP, Pakistan) and probably dating c. 100 A.D. (94). Their overall resemblance rests on a similar concept of femaleness, expressed in the posture, the pose of the right arm, the ornaments, the sash suspended on the left hip and the flaring hem (whose folds are indicated by double parallel horizontal lines). So too, the presence of Bh? Devi seems to be a Northwestern convention as she does not appear in the early 'N?r?yana' images from Mathur? (95). Again, the Berlin 'N?r?yana' is the closest parallel to our 'N?r?yana'. Both show Bh? Devi coming out of the pericarp of the flower (96). But here the comparison stops. Whereas the Bh? Devi on our bronze appears on the front of the pedestal with arms lifted upward as if to support the ground underneath the deities, the 7th century Berlin Bh? Devi is winged and appears between the legs of the central figure; with her arms lowered, she seems to balance (or raise) herself. Although the Berlin brass image offers the only early Northwestern example of Bh? Devi in an identical context, the partial form of the Earth Goddess can be noticed between the legs of the sculpture of V?sudeva-Krsna housed in The British Museum (97). Precedence for an emerging Earth Goddess located on the platform underneath a deity can be found in Gandh?ran art. In a Gandh?ran relief depicting the Buddha's conquest over M?ra, the upper body of the Earth Goddess is carved in the middle of the pedestal upon which the Buddha sits (98). Another Northwestern innovation may be the (93) See Begley, Sudarsana-Cakra, cit., figs. 5 and 18. P.

The difficulty lies in the fact that none of the Gupta 'N?r?yana' reliefs from Mathur? still have the natural right hand intact. Kus?na reliefs of V?sudeva-Krsna, including the late Kus?na reliefs (") do not features the padrna, nor apparently do the Gupta Visnu images from north central India (10?). The situation is different in the Northwest although not diagnostically different. The Berlin 'N?r?yana' holds a lotus in his natural right hand; however the flower's depiction differs from that of our 'N?r?yana' bronze since the lotus is held much higher, has a longer stem, and a raised seed-pod. Other early vaisnava images both from the Northwest and Kashmir also show the lotus carried in the natural right hand of the god; however, even though the stalk can be shorter than that of the Berlin flower, they all seem to feature the raised seed-pod (101). All these examples, it must be quickly underscored, are one to two hundred years later than the 'N?r?yana' bronze. For the present, the 'N?r?yana' bronze of 427 A.D. has the distinction of being the earliest vaisnava image to display the padma. These comparisons suggest a trend. Although our bronze may share some of the distinctive innovations of both the Northwest and the Gangetic Valley, its style and iconography are more an intermingling of the two regions than the predominant expression of one. The image also does not reveal the aesthetic subtleties associated with sculptures from either of the regions. The crispness and the naturalism of Gandh?ra stone carvings or the graceful litheness of Gupta stone carvings cannot be discerned. Post-Gandh?ra bronzes, especially from Swat, do not have much more in common with the 'N?r?yana' bronze than Gandh?ran stone carvings. A group of 20 Buddhist bronzes were recently attributed to Swat on the basis of technical studies and art historical criteria. It is important to note that the point of departure of the technical studies is the use of 'art historically defined groups of plausible attribution' (102). The results of the studies indicated that Swati bronzes produced between the 5th and 7th century have a couple of technical features in common with the 'N?r?yana' bronze, (") See H?rtel, 'Early Vasudeva Worship', cit., pi.

These examples span the 4th to 6th century A.D. (101) Paul, 'An Early Kashmiri Visnu', cit., figs. 3, 7, 8. Paul has shown that this feature is already seen on the lotus carried by some of the Gandh?ran Bodhisattvas. See fig. 10. (102) C.L.

Eilenberg Collection, Metropolitan Museum of Art. namely a high tin content and probably the hole in the back. However these early Swati examples (Reedy's figs. 9 and 13; 10 and 6) use inlay and exhibit physiognomic traits, pedestals and ornamentation unlike those associated with the 'N?r?yana' bronze. Focus on the two earliest Swati bronzes from this study clarifies the issues. Reedy's fig. 9 is the oldest, dated to the 5th century (103). The small bronze (ht. 7.5 cm) depicts S?kyamuni Buddha seated on a very constricted base on top of a simple lotus. The features in his oval face appear much effaced, although it is possible to discern the narrow eyes (104), the copper inlay in the lips and the silver inlay in the eyes. The Buddha's shoulders droop and the general proportions of this seated figure do not appear unusual (e.g. the head is not too big for the body). Reedy's fig. 13 of a seated Vairocana is dated to the 5th-6th century on the basis of carbon-14 testing (105). The god's face is broad, the eyes are narrow, the mouth is small and thin. Silver is used to inlay the eyes and copper for the lips. The god's shoulder's are straight; the waist is small. The impression that the head is too large for the body is created by the high, elaborate crown displaying the five Buddhas. Vairocana's other ornaments ? the pearl necklace, floral earrings and armlets ? are in keeping with his gorgeous headgear. He sits on a tasseled cushion placed on the backs of a row of lions which rest atop a double lotus throne. Clearly, neither these Buddhist bronzes nor the Northwest vaisnava images discussed thus far offer persuasive evidence for selecting the Gandh?ran-Swat heartland as the provenance of the 'N?r?yana' bronze. Kashmir is another unlikely provenance. Now that at least two 6th century Kashmiri images of four-armed V?sudeva-Krsna can be used for comparative purposes (106), it is possible to exclude Kashmir on art historical grounds, in addition to the foregoing paleographic and technical criteria. (103) It is listed simply as coming from a private collection. (104) The narrowness cannot convey meditation since the Buddha's right hand is in varada mudr? and his left hand holds the hem of the robe. (105) Thjg image belongs to the Metropolitan Museum of Art (No. 1987.218.7). (106) Paul, 'An Early Kashmiri Visnu, cit., figs. 7-8. 136 [32]</page><page sequence="33">But the pedestal of our 'N?r?yana' image opens up new geographic spheres. It is remarkably similar to a series of bronze bases dating between the 4th-7th century A.D. and found over a vast territory, stretching from Gandh?ra eastward and southward to lands below the Vindhya Mountains in Central India. The earliest, to date, is a late Gandh?ra Buddhist reliquary; dated to c. the 4th century A.D. It features a decorated st?pa, with a circular drum, resting upon a small pedestal which, in turn, is stacked upon a larger pedestal (107). The bronze, cast in several pieces, was allegedly discovered in the Swat Valley. Both pedestals of the reliquary already exemplify the distinctively simple design that characterizes the series: a rectangular shape, framed, on all sides, by a few, plain mouldings that leave a wide central space bare (or inscribed). The pedestal supporting the bronze Buddha found at Dhanesar Khera (U.P.) and dated c. 400 A.D. is virtually identical to ours, except that it is raised on four lion claws. Whether this piece, in the collection of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art (No. 44-13), ought to be assigned to the Northwest or to Central India had been unclear (108) until the comparatively recent find of another 5th century bronze Buddha from Ramtek in Vidarbha (Nagpur district, Maharashtra) (109). Stylistically the Ramtek Buddha, including the pedestal (devoid of the lion claws), is very similar to the image from Dhanesar Khera. From Phophnar, a village on the border of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, were found other 5th century Buddhist bronzes, some of which rest on pedestals with the same characteristic order noted above (110). For our purposes, the pedestals of these central Indian Buddhist bronzes made during the height of Gupta-V?k?taka artistic traditions, together with the Late Gandh?ran pedestals illustrate the extensive terrain wherein this sort of pedestal was popular already by the 5th century. A post-Gandh?ran bronze of the Buddha, allegedly from Sahri Bahlol and dated between the 5th-7th century, shows a slight variation of the same type of pedestal (ln). The wide central section between the mouldings, has oblique rather (107) See U. von Schroeder, Indo-Tibetan Bronzes, Hong Kong 1981, p. 76, no. 2.2.F. H.

The tendency for oblique contours is found on the bronze pedestal of the 5th-6th century Buddha in the Norton Simon Collection (112), and on the 7th century Berlin 'N?r?yana' image. As such the shape of these 5th/6th and 7th century pedestals vary slightly from our 'N?r?yana' pedestal. But it must straightaway be acknowledged that the Berlin pedestal also shows a significant similarity to our pedestal; it shows the same double vertical lines intermittently decorating the thin band (Fig. 12; see the lower band). Another variant of this pedestal comes from Kashmir. The inscribed pedestal is underneath a seated bronze Buddha whose late 6th century date has recently been proposed by Fussman on the basis of paleographic and linguistic arguments (113). It is interesting to observe with Fussman that this sort of simple, rectilinear pedestal is similar to those found under seated Buddhas on the petroglyphs at Chilas I, assigned to the same date (114). It may be added that simple, rectilinear bases also occur under st?pas at Chilas I where they are stacked as they diminish in size (115). As such, they show some similarity to the above mentioned Late Gandh?ra reliquary, featuring a small st?pa raised on two stacked pedestals. In short, the pedestal of our 'N?r?yana' bronze though simple in design, yields two major insights. First, it confirms the paleographic analysis: on balance, our bronze could well date to the early 5th century A.D. Secondly, it opens up the possibility that the provenance for the piece could be north or east of Swat and Taxila, that is in some region closer to the cultural and artistic zone of Chilas/Kashmir. This is indeed a welcome possibility as it is becoming progressively clear that the aggregate of technical, artistic, and paleographic characteristics of this image do not quite gel around either a Gandh?ran, Kashmiri, or a Gange tic attribution. IV. Other Northern Regions with Early Vaisnava Imagery (DMS) Chilas Chilas itself contains very early vaisnava imagery. On the western face of a rock at Chilas II, there are engravings of two male figures and an inscription naming them as 'Rama[kri]s?', that is, Balar?ma and Krsna. The attributes and positioning (112) See von Schroeder, Indo-Tibetan Bronzes, cit., p. 78, fig. 3.3B. (113) G. Fussman, 'Chilas, Hatun et les bronzes bouddhiques du Cachemire', in Antiquities of Northern Pakistan II, K. Jettmar, ed., Mainz 1993, pp. 29-31, re: 6.2; See Paul, Early Sculpture of Kashmir, cit., pi. 83. The variant consists of placing the inscription on the bottom register, and sectioning this register off from the principle moulding by several thin bands. (114) Fussman, 'Bronzes bouddhiques', cit., pi. 13; A.H. Dani, Chilas, Islamabad 1983, p. 147, fig. 119. (115) See Fussman, 'Bronzes bouddhiques', cit., pi. 15. 138 [34]</page><page sequence="35">of the two figures leave little doubt that they represent Samkarsana/Balar?ma and V?sudeva-Krsna. The shorter figure holds the wheel and club; this is V?sudeva Krsna and he stands to the left of Samkarsana/Balar?ma who is taller and holds the club and plough. These petroglyphs, dated to the first half of the first century A.D. on the basis of the paleography of the inscription (116), are not depictions of the first and second vy?ha. The vy?ha doctrine emphasizes the theological preeminence of V?sudeva. At Chilas II, however, V?sudeva-Krsna cedes eminence to Samkarsana/Balar?ma in both height and position. Nor do the engravings represent Balar?ma and Krsna as avat?ras. In the several centuries around the Christian era, very few avat?ras are depicted in the subcontinent; the few that are depicted all have four arms. None of these can, with certainty, be identified as V?sudeva-Krsna and Samkarsana/Balar?ma. The portrayals at Chilas II are typical, however, for the way the two gods appear as objects of worship in a hero-cult. The cult centers on devotion to V?sudeva-Krsna, his elder brother, Samkarsana/Balar?ma and other personages in their lineage, the Vrsni lineage. The worship of the Vrsni Viras (i.e. heroes), originating, no doubt in Mathur?, gives evidence of the initial exaltation of V?sudeva whose apotheosis culminates in the sects of the Bh?gavatas and the P?ncar?trins. Paradoxically, for the historian wishing to trace the ascendancy of V?sudeva, his earliest unambiguous representations as one of the deified Vrsni Viras are, for the present, found not in Mathur?, but in the North (117). In the mid 1st century A.D. worship of V?sudeva was established in the Upper Indus, having penetrated into the Northwest several centuries earlier (118) and attained a permanent foothold there. Thus when searching for the likely provenance of the 'N?r?yana' bronze, it is to the vaisnava legacy in regions North, West, and South of the Chilas/Kashmir zone and the vaisnava images produced there between the 5th and 7th century A.D., that one must look. Darel Above Chilas, but in the same district, lies Darel wherefrom is said to come a vaisnava stone relief of four-armed Visnu as liberator of Gajendra, lord of elephants (116) G. Fussman, 'Les inscriptions kharosthi de la plaine de Chilas', in Antiquities of Northern Pakistan. Reports and Studies, Vol. I, ed. K. Jettmar, Mainz 1989, pp. 3-6; see pi. 4.

Possibly Taxila region. J. Sherrier Collection. (Fig. 13). Its c. 6th century date is proposed on the basis of its similarity to a group of vaisnava potstone sculptures analyzed by Paul and assigned to that date (119). As such, the Darel Visnu, wearing a vanam?l? composed of stacked rectangles, holds the conch in his lower left hand in precisely the same manner as the 6th century images of V?sudeva Krsna from Dharmar?jik? and The British Museum. Further, his upper left hand carries a round shield edged in much the same way as the circular rims of the haloes surrounding these two images. Visnu's large hoop earrings, his broad shoulders, inflated chest, muscular upper arms and comparatively slender legs compare favorable with these two images and others related, by Paul, to the series. However, these features cannot be found in our 'N?r?yana' bronze. 'N?r?yana' looks almost childlike in comparison to the Darel Visnu and the Dharmar?jik? and The British Museum images of V?sudeva-Krsna. The childlike quality resides not only in the undeveloped musculature; it mainly resides in the proportions of the central figure. The face is somewhat too large for the body and the upper torso is somewhat more elongated than the lower limbs. The degree to which this is a stylistic, rather than a conceptual, phenomenon can be quickly demonstrated. From the Dharmar?jik? compound in Taxila comes a potstone representation of the youthful Skanda/K?rttikeya, executed in a manner very similar to the V?sudeva-Krsna image from the Dharmar?jik?; the style and proportions of Skanda/K?rttikeya have not been altered to convey youthfulness (120). In other words, when there is a need to depict a divine youth, it can be done in the Northwest by way of iconography and not necessarily via a stylistic shift in bodily proportions. (119) Pal has dated the relief to 800 A.D. See P. Pal, 'Art from the Northwest of the Indian Subcontinent', (Aspects of South Asian Art in the new galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art), Arts of Asia, 24, 2, 1994, fig. 18, p. 87.

The steatite fragment (4" ht.; 3 1/4" w.), is in the Collection of J. Sherrier. The fragment may represent a Gandh?ra 'N?r?yana' image. The tricephalic head of the Sherrier fragment has one unusual variation. The National Museum in New Delhi has another example reputedly from Kashmir, but I have not seen the piece. (See JASB, XVIII, 1951-53, pp. 251-53, pi. III). The lateral heads are of the same animal, the lion. The significance of this iconographic anomaly is unclear. The piece allegedly originates from Charsada, but the central human head looks like the V?sudeva-Krsna head from the Dharmar?jik? and the one from The British Museum. The Sherrier piece also features a detail in the headdress of the lateral animals seen on another sculpture from the Dharmar?jik?, namely the Skanda/K?rttikeya. The device looks like a crescent with a center rod inside; in all the cases, the device is located in the front and center of the headdress. The Sherrier 'N?r?yana' (if this is the correct identification) is cited here to show that, in the 6th century, Brahmanical images, especially vaisnava images, are not as rare in Northern regions outside of Kashmir as is sometimes supposed (on this point, also see below) (121). Moreover, Northern 'N?r?yana' images may also not be so unusual, for when the Sherrier 'N?r?yana' is added to our inscribed 'N?r?yana' bronze, the Berlin 'N?r?yana', and (probably) a polycephalic terracotta first published in 1898 (122), the total number of 'N?r?yana' images from the North, thus far described, comes to four. That number will augment when the evidence from Kangra, Kulu and Chamba is counted. The Sherrier 'N?r?yana' is not cited to reopen the possibility of a Taxila-Gandh?ran provenance for our inscribed 'N?r?yana' bronze. The Sherrier 'N?r?yana' and the inscribed bronze 'N?r?yana' exhibit no similarities in the shape of the faces, the facial features, ornamentation ? including crown, necklaces, earrings, ? the modelling of the chests, nor even in the employment of specific vaisnava symbols: the kaustubha is found on the Sherrier 'N?r?yana' (Fig. 14) and the srivatsa is on the other (Fig. 1). It can straightaway be reiterated that the 'N?r?yana' bronze is not at home in the Taxila-Gandh?ra region. (121) The supposition that Kashmir is by far the main Northern region where Brahmanic worship was practiced during the 6th century is a major reason for Paul to attribute the entire series of early vaisnava images to Kashmir, even though he concedes that most of the pieces in the series were found in the region of Gandh?ra; see Paul, Early Sculpture of Kashmir, cit., p. 120. (122) Fig. 9 in Paul, 'An Early Kashmiri Visnu', cit., p. 843; taken from J. Burgess, 'The Gandh?ra Sculptures', Journal of Indian Art and Industry, VIII, 1898, pp. 23-40.

A rather spectacular Var?ha, carved on a 92 cm limestone stele, has recently come to light in Lakki Tehsil, Bannu District, NWFP, Pakistan. This is an area not known for Gandh?ran sculpture. The relief has been quite thoroughly described and convincingly dated to the mid-4th-early 5th Fig. 15 - Para V?sudeva-N?r?yana. c. 2nd half of the 7th century. Masrur, Himachal Pradesh. Photograph by Mme Helene Diserens. century by Farid Khan (123). There is no need to repeat his details here other than to remark that the figure combines influences from Sassanian art, local traditions, and Gupta art growing out of Kus?na iconographic and stylistic innovations conceived, most notably, at Mathur?. This combination of artistic influences does not characterize the 'N?r?yana' bronze. The 'N?r?yana' bronze does, of course,' reflect a combination of influences, but the Sassanian factor is absent. So too, is a Parthian factor absent. Accordingly, it is unlikely that the bronze originates from a region bordering on, or influenced by, western Asia. The remaining Northern region producing Hindu art between the 5th and 7th century A.D. is below Kashmir, in what is now called Himachal Pradesh. Three main areas of artistic activity are Kangra, Kulu and Chamba and it is to these that we must now turn. Kangra Among the Hindu deities carved on the rock cut temples at Masrur, Kangra, it is possible to identify a figure somewhat similar to the bronze 'N?r?yana' (Fig. (123) Farid Khan, 'Recent Discoveries from the North-West, Pakistan', SAS, 8, 1992, pp. 67 ff. 142 [38]</page><page sequence="39">15) (124). The sandstone temples have greatly deteriorated and details on the sculpture are not easily discernible. Nonetheless the type we are tracing can be spotted effortlessly in a niche on the eastern side of the central, principle temple. This is, states Mme Diserens, the oldest part of the temple complex, and could not be earlier than the mid-or second half of the 7th century A.D.; the entire complex took a very long time to excavate (125). The tricephalic Masrur 'N?r?yana' has the lion face to the right and the boar face to the left. Two of his four arms can be seen without difficulty, they are lowered and reach out to touch the upper part of Gad?devi's gada, on his right, and the top of Cakrapurusa on his left. The similarity between this figure and the bronze 'N?r?yana' is limited to the general configuration of the body. The waist of the Masrur figure is defined, the hips are noticeably round, the body tends towards squatness, the legs spread slightly as do the lower arms; the outline thereby created is not unlike that of the bronze. However, it cannot be said that the Masrur head is disproportionately larger than the body, as is the case with the bronze figure. A dating for this temple complex has been proposed on the basis of style alone; there is no inscription associated with the site. The post-Gupta stylistic traits of the sculptures and some of the architectural ornamentations have been noticed by Hargreaves (126), and Ohri, who also points out that lingering Gandh?ran influence combined with local traits (127). Hargreaves, writing in 1915, placed the temple in the 8th century which is also Ohri's date. Vincent Smith who saw photographs of Masrur made in 1913 put the date at the 7th century, which is where I, too, would date the Masrur 'N?r?yana'. The stance of 'N?r?yana's body (though not its general configuration), the remaining traces of the god's dhoti and vanam?l? together with the stance of his attendants can be compared to a 7th century Visnu image from Bijbeh?ra now in the Sri Pratap Singh Museum, Srinagar (128). Local tradition assigns the excavation of the Masrur shrines to the P?ndavas who are said to have executed the work during a night of six months' duration occurring at the time they were exiled in the forest (129). This legend is of interest in the present context because the inscription on the 427 A.D. 'N?r?yana' bronze mentions that the image was installed at Bhim?sth?na (the holy place of Bhim?). Bhima is one of the P?ndavas. Bhima is (124) I am pleased to acknowledge the gracious assistance given to me by Mme Helene Diserens on the art of Masrur and Chamba and I wish to thank her for providing me with the photographs for Figs. 15, 16, and 19.

Remains of a fairly large st?pa, known as Bhima-til? exists near the village of Chaitru (13?). It is not uncommon in the hills for old monuments to be linked with the P?ndavas (131). For example, a large number of temples in Hatkoti, situated in southeastern Himachal Pradesh are attributed to the P?ndavas. Singh illustrates a stone sculpture of the figure of Bhima from a P?ndava Temple in Rohru Valley, just North of Hatkoti (132). I am not aware that other Northern regions outside of present-day Himachal Pradesh put similar emphasis on Bhima. Kulu Quite a number of the earliest vaisnava sculptures surviving from Bajaura, Nirmand and neighboring regions in Kulu, have things in common with the 'N?r?yana' bronze. The earliest vaisnava image, a four-armed, life-size sculpture of V?sudeva-Krsna from Nirmand, is now in the State Museum, Simla (Fig. 16). Ohri, calling it a 'Visnu' image, describes it as free standing and having a flat back. The god's stance is frontal with the weight equally distributed so that there are no bends in the body. The extra hands of the god are place over his attributes, the wheel on the right and the gada to the left. Noting the broad, inflated chest and the belly's gentle protuberance, especially as it bulges due to the constriction of the tight lower garment, Ohri rightly associates the style with the vigorous images produced in the Gangetic Valley during the lst-2nd century A.D. However, not all of the sculpture's features stem from North India; notable in this respect are the crown, the treatment of the hair and the ornamentation. Ohri opines that the sculpture was produced locally because the stone used is only available there and not in the lower hills or the plains; he dates the image to the 6th century (133). To one familiar with imagery of V?sudeva-Krsna in the Gangetic area, this image resembles the equally large statue of V?sudeva-Krsna in Gay? District which reflects stylistic developments of the late Kus?na-early Gupta period in Mathur? (Fig. 17) (134). Similarities between the two sculptures focus on their size, stance, degree of modelling of the bodies, the shape of the faces, the simple ornamentations, the manner of holding the conch and, in each instance, the portrayal of the dhoti; the tendency towards squatness and (13?)

Photograph Patna Museum. compacteness in the Nirmand statue is more of a local trait (cf. Figs. 16-17). The Nirmand V?sudeva-Krsna certainly exhibits an interplay of local and Gangetic characteristics. It may be that influence from the Gangetic plains to Nirmand traveled faster that Ohri's dating would suppose. Direct routes connected the two regions and helped spread the stylistic achievements of Uttar Pradesh deep inside areas of the western Himalayas (135). The V?sudeva-Krsna of Nirmand looks as if it could date between the 4th-6th century A.D. Also from Nirmand is a second sculpture of V?sudeva-Krsna that shows new elements mixed with those of the earlier image seen in Fig. 16. Ohri, who describes it sufficiently, dates it to the 7th-8th century (136); I would not go as high as the 8th century. The feature of greatest interest in the present context is that the weapons, personified here, are arranged, just as in the previous Nirmand image: Cakrapurusa (135) Ohri, Western Himalayas, cit., p. 33. (136) Ibid., pp. 46-47; see pi. 2.41. [41] 145</page><page sequence="42">is on the right and Gad?devi is on the left of the deity. A third human size image of V?sudeva-Krsna from Nirmand, perhaps belonging to the early 8th century, also depicts the personified weapons in these positions (137). Evidently, this arrangement, seen in the Nirmand images and in the inscribed 'N?r?yana' bronze, is unusual in most places but not so in Kulu. Moreover, this arrangement can be documented in the art of Kulu at about the same time, or a little later than it occurs in the art of Mathur? (cf. Figs. 16 and 9). Parenthetically, a 6th century architectural fragment of Govardhana Krsna also comes from Nirmand; evidently this site sustained a community of bhaktas to V?sudeva during the Gupta and post-Gupta periods (138). In the village of Nirath, a few kilometers from Nirmand, exists a 13th century temple to S?rya-N?r?yana which, according to Ohri, must have been built in the place of an older temple, since the 13th century temple incorporates sculptures of a period 'about five centuries earlier' (139). One of the older sculptures depicts what we may now call the 'N?r?yana' type of figure (140). The stone Visvar?pa from Bajaura, c. 7th century (141), has some iconographic similarities in common with the type exemplified by the 5 th century inscribed 'N?r?yana' bronze. The similarities have caused Mallmann to believe Visnu Visvar?pa is a syncretic aspect of the Caturvy?ha forms of Para V?sudeva. A discussion of what that may mean in terms of the theological connections between Visvar?pa, the Caturvy?ha forms of Para V?sudeva and N?r?yana, will be explained in Sections V and VI. For now, it is the iconographic connections that are of interest. The iconographic core of the Bajaura Visvar?pa, it will be noticed, is based on the type called 'N?r?yana' throughout this paper. The core reduces to a four-armed human figure with lateral heads of the lion and boar to the right and left. Traces of Gad?devi and Cakrapurusa remain on the pedestal of the Bajaura Visvar?pa. On noteworthy detail is the presence of a horse's head over the crown worn by the human head. But (137) Ibid., p. 49; this image, near the entrance of the Parasurama temple, shows an emerging Bhu Devi between the feet of the god. (138) Ibid., p. 47. (139) Ibid., p. 50.

Diserens, 'Mahis?suramardini Associated with Visnu: Rare Iconography on a Stele at Manali', in South Asian Archaeology 1989, Madison 1992, fig. 42.2. Regarding my date for this image, I consider, on the one hand, the modeling of the torso, the face, and the type of crown of the Bajaura Visvar?pa to be more developed than that of the 4th-6th century Nirmand V?sudeva-Krsna (Fig. 16) and the B?ram?la 6th century torso of Visnu (see Siudmak, 'Early Stone... Sculpture', cit., fig. 6). On the other hand, the Visvar?pa does not have the Kashmiri elements seen in Bajaura 'N?r?yana' sculpture, probably of the late 8th century. (This sculpture is illustrated in Maxwell, 'Vaikuntha', cit., figs. 15 and 16). The silhouette of the body of the Bajaura Visvar?pa appears more or less comparable to the 7th century Nirmand V?sudeva-Krsna, mentioned above and in n. 136. 146 [42]</page><page sequence="43">a complete description of this famous and oft-described stele is not necessary (142), as only those details relating to the provenance of the 'N?r?yana' are being pursued. In this connection, two details can be mentioned. First, the lotus is held by Visvar?pa in a way that is similar to the way 'N?r?yana' of the bronze holds the flower. Second, the head of the boar on Visvar?pa's left side is raised at an angle similar to the boar on 'N?r?yana's' left. The raised position of the head of the boar is likely to be another item influenced by the art of Mathur?, where this position is noticed in the Florida 'N?r?yana' of the late 3rd-early 4th century (Fig. 9), in the (early?) 5th century 'N?r?yana' in the Boston Museum of Fine Art, and in the Visvar?pa from Bhankari, Mathur? (143). Bhima is well-known in Kulu Valley; a Kulu R?ksasi, Hirimb?/Hidimb? fell in love with Bhima. Their love story and mating all over the Himalayan region, including the shores of the legendary Lake M?nasa in Kashmir, is told in the Adi Parva of the Mah?bh?rata (144). Although she is infrequently met with in other parts of the subcontinent, Hidimb? seems to have entered the Hindu pantheon; a temple in Kulu was constructed for her habitation and worship. In Kulu Valley more than the epic legend are associated with Hidimb? and Bhima (145). She and Bhima appear to be connected with the preservation of the Kulu royal line; from an inscription and local legends, Pott has proposed that a royal marriage took place in the 16th century wherein the groom and bride personify the epic lovers to ensure analogous progeny (146). A Chamba r?ja took on the role of Bhima, the only surviving princess of Kulu that of Hidimb?, and their union was sanctioned to ensure the continuance of the Kulu Bad?ni dynasty. For our purposes it is important to note that a medieval analogy to an epic legend could not have been enacted had not the epic hero and Hidimb? been raised to some sort of cult status during the intervening centuries. In sum, a concentration of elements similar to the bronze 'N?r?yana' comes from Kangra and Kulu. To summarize them; two other pre-Kashmiri 'N?r?yana' images; images that likewise reflect an intermingling of lingering Gandh?ran and Gangetic influences upon a local product; a preference for a squat bodily type; the repeated occurrence of Cakrapurusa to the right of 'N?r?yana'; considerable prominence given to the P?ndava Bhima in regional legends, history, and monuments.

Indeed, Chamba clinches the argument favoring Himachal Pradesh as the likely source for the 427 A.D. 'N?r?yana'. It will be shown that Chamba has strong links to the worship of N?r?yana. Further, its early phase of Hindu art, fashioned during the Gupta and post-Gupta periods, shows a similar intermingling of late Kus?na (both from Mathur? and Gandh?ra) and later Gupta characteristics as does the 'N?r?yana' bronze. The physiognomy of Chamba imagery is close to the facial characteristics of the bronze 'N?r?yana'. Lastly, one term used in the inscription of the 'N?r?yana' bronze arguably implicates the general region of Himachal Pradesh. The oldest antiquities from Chamba date around the 6th century; they include the platform of a brick temple (in the Bhuri Singh Museum) and the S?rya image from Gum (147). This image, variously dated between the 6th-7th century (148), is a good example of the intermingling of styles and iconography in the early art of Chamba. S?rya's dress is at home in the northern regions; his close trimmed beard is also peculiar to the Northwest, according to Ohri (149). Yet the style of the sculpture is in the Gupta idiom, and the manner in which S?rya squats within his horse-drawn chariot is a convention already well-established in Mathur? art of the Kus?na period (150). The significance of S?rya's squat, or bhadr?sana pose, can be determined from the context of a Mathur? relief depicting the life of the Buddha; here it symbolized lineage, specifically the S?ryavamsa or Solar lineage (151). The stone sculpture of Skanda-K?rttikeya (Fig. 18), which may be even earlier (i.e. 5th-6th century), has the same short legs and somewhat too large head as seen in the 'N?r?yana' bronze. The Skanda-K?rttikeya image is still under worship at the Sakti Devi temple at Chhatrarhi, Chamba, where presumably it was made. Some of Skanda/K?rttikeya's facial features also tally with those of the bronze 'N?r?yana'. Both have a short brow, but large almond shaped eyes set in heavy, pronounced upper and lower lids; also both have full lips and a well-developed chin that is small. Still in situ, at the same temple, is a wooden relief of 'N?r?yana' showing essentially the same physiognomy, though the (147) See V.C.

The central human head of 'N?r?yana* does not accentuate the lower eyelid as much, but the head has the same strong, fleshy nose and round, youthful cheeks as does the bronze 'N?r?yana'. In addition, it is interesting to note that his mace presents a ribbed profile not unlike the mace held aloft by Vasudeva-Krsna from Gay? District (Fig. 17). Similar facial features are found on two more pieces, allegedly from Chamba. The first is a bronze 'mask' (mohra), possibly of Siva. It is in the collection of M. Postel who describes the (152) Like so many of the antiquities from Himachal Pradesh, it is not easy to obtain consensus on the date of the Chhatrarhi temple.

Mankodi, Antiquities o/Himachal, Bombay 1985, p. 185, fig. 286. 150 [46]</page><page sequence="47">'N?r?yana' is best captured by the words of Stella Kramrisch: The young, round, firm face ? with its full, detailed lips; strong, sensitive nose; and wide-open, commanding, demanding eyes [...] gazes [...] far beyond the world that the nose scents and the mouth relishes' (154). To best appreciate the likeness of these two faces is to see them both in profile (cf. Fig. 21 with Fig. 8). Then the same expression arising from the same physiognomy is seen in sharp relief. I am inclined to think that the sort of visage seen on the several pieces from Himachal Pradesh is due to a local physical type. One need only look at the devotee, photographed sitting at the feet of the 7th century icon of Sakti Devi kept in her Temple at Chhatrarhi, to see a face that is similar to that of Sakti Devi herself, as well as the 427 A.D. 'N?r?yana', and in some respects to the Siva mohra (155). The Siva mohra is dated by von Schroeder to 450-550 A.D. and assigned to Chamba (156). Kramrisch revised her dating several times; her first dating was c. 450 to 550, then she placed it into the '6th-8th century(?) and Chamba(?)' (157), but in 1990 she assigned it to c. 800-900 (158). Postel et al. consign the Siva mask to the 9th century and to the Middle Sutlej (159). Literary evidence may also help to situate the 'N?r?yana' bronze into what is now Himachal Pradesh. The inscription on the 'N?r?yana' bronze states that the image was installed at Bhim?sth?na. A tirtha called Bhim?sth?na is mentioned in Mah?bh?rata 3.80.100 [bhim?y?h sth?nam); the name occurs in a description about making a pilgrimage of sacred sites. By noting the sites mentioned before and after the (Holy) Place-of-Bhim? (160) in this account, it is possible to gain a rough approximation of the location of this tirtha. Here is the sequence of sites immediately surrounding Bhim?sth?na (3.80.99-105): Pancanada, Bhim?sth?na, Girimunja (cited as Girikunja in several mss.), Vimala, Malad?. Pancanada is the region of the five rivers, namely the Punjab (161). Girimunja cannot be geographically located (162). (154) S. Kramrisch, Manifestations of Shiva, Philadelphia 1981, p. 103.

[47] 151</page><page sequence="48">Both Vimala and Malad? are tirthas in Kashmir (163). The general direction, therefore, of this segment of the tour seems to be from the Punjab, northeasterly, to Kashmir. This direction could well cut thro.ugh a part of Himachal Pradesh. As a result, Bhim?sth?na could lie either in the Punjab, or someplace between the Punjab and Kashmir, such as Himachal Pradesh. Kashmir is also a possible choice for the location of Bhim?sth?na. From among these choices, the bronze itself favors some areas over others: 1) The script of the 'N?r?yana' bronze, it will be remembered, is similar to the script found at Sh?rk?t, in Punjab; 2) Part of the formulaic expression of the date in the inscription (i.e. atrajayatra dwase), together with appearance of dotted aksaras, remind of occurrences on the Sui Vih?r inscription from southeastern Punjab; 3) Both Sh?rk?t and Sui Vih?r are in the general neighboring region, being South and West of Himachal Pradesh; 4) The aggregate of the Bronze's stylistic, iconographic and cultural (see also below) indicators favour Himachal Pradesh over the Punjab; 5) Technical considerations do not rule out this general region. The Bhim?sth?na of the inscription ought, therefore, to be located somewhere between eastern Punjab and western Himachal Pradesh. If we assume that the bronze was installed near the place that it was made, then the probable provenance of the 'N?r?yana' bronze ought to be in this same area. I am inclined to place the bronze more towards Himachal Pradesh because strong religious and cultural forces, concentrating on 'N?r?yana' operate there (see below). Of course, the possibility exists that Bhim?sth?na refers to the (Holy) Place-of-Bhim? (a female goddess who may be associated with the goddess Hidimb? (164). This goddess attained the rank of the Mother Goddess in Kulu and is addressed as 'Bhim?k?li', among other names (165). The name, Bhim?, is the feminine of the name of the god with whom she is connected, much like the names of the Hindu Saptam?trk?s, the seven mother goddess, are formed). Were this the case, mention of a Bhim?devi of Him?cala in the early M?rkandeya Pur?na (Chapt. 91, see verses 45-48), would appear to implicate the same general region. Followers of the P?ncar?tra sect ought to have inhabited the region of Himachal Pradesh to judge by the three early 'N?r?yana' images (excluding the 427 A.D. bronze), (163) According to Kane, Dharmasastra IV, Vimala is a famous spring near the M?rtanda Temple (p. 821) and Malada is in Kashmir according to Padma Pur?na, 1.25 A (p. 778). (164) Lore Sander opines that bhim?sth?na in this passage may describe a tirtha where a man becomes the son of the goddess after having taken a bath in her yoni, probably a spring; the goddess bhim? may refer to an unknown local goddess. I must register an inability to agree with this statement. First, the passage does not qualify the 'yonV as belonging to anyone in particular. Second, it needs to be stressed that yoni is a term having meanings other than 'female genitalia' and the like associated with the female. Vedic literature is replete in the references to yoni where the term means 'the source', 'the place', (i.e. the place of power, especially creative power). As such, 'yoni' can be associated with a male god (e.g. Satapatha Brdhmana, 8.2.2.5; Brhad Aranyaka Upanisad, 1.4.11). (165) See Jettmar-Thakur, 'Raksasa Lore', cit., p. 107. 152 [48]</page><page sequence="49">mentioned above. These images in style and iconography draw upon Gangetic models, especially models developed from the Mathur? idiom. The prominence, and precedence, of Gangetic models for this type suggest that the beliefs also originated in the Gangetic Valley and spread from there to the Himalayan valleys, but the latter supposition is rather conjectural. Probably P?ncar?tra originated in the North of India, though where in the North is somewhat unclear (166). It is clear that P?ncar?tra Visnuism enjoyed great popularity in the Himalayan valleys, as seen by the increased number of 'N?r?yana' icons in Chamba and Kashmir from the 8th century onwards (167). Indeed, one inscribed 'N?r?yana' image can assuredly be attributed to medieval Chamba. The Museum at Chamba preserves a 12th century stone image of Laksmi-N?r?yana riding on Garuda bearing an inscription which names the icon as 'N?r?yana' (168). Sectarian ideology may not be the only reason for the popularity of 'N?r?yana' images in this region. The lineage of local rulers can descend from N?r?yana and thus add to his importance here. For example, the rulers of Chamba trace their descent from N?r?yana. The Chamba Vamsavall, in the form published by Vogel (169), is a c. 17th century text charting the lineage of the rulers of Chamba. The text opens with a declaration that god N?r?yana is the progenitor of the S?ryavamsa (i.e. the Solar lineage) from which ultimately stem the rulers of Chamba. That is, the 34th on the list is Campa, the mythical founder of the town of Campa. The testimony from this late text could be handily dismissed for the early period, were it not that its declaration explains numerous artistic phenomena in Chamba and other Himalayan valleys dating to the early period. The testimony could confirm that the 6th century Gum S?rya image makes symbolic reference to the S?ryavamsa and has therefore the same significance in Chamba as in the Kus?na art of Mathur?, a not unlikely supposition in view of the fact that early Chamba art and iconography exhibit unquestionable influence from Mathur?. (The significance of the S?rya from Masrur who assumes the same low squatting position, would also fall into place) (170). The testimony could explain why a Kulu temple such as the one at Nirath, dating back (166) Schr?der, P?ncar?tra, cit., p. 16. Schr?der thinks of the extreme North, on the basis of the story in the N?r?yaniya section in the S?nti Parvan of the Mah?bh?rata; the story suggests that the home of P?ncar?tra worship is in the Northern Svetadvipa. However, worship of V?sudeva, pivotal in the P?ncar?tra system, originated in the region of Mathur?. (167) A brief survey is available in K.N. Misra, The Vaikuntha Images from Chamba and Other Centres in North-West India', in Chamba State, cit., p. 111-21. Additional examples can be seen in Postel et al., Antiquities of Himachal, cit., pp. 99-101. (168) J.Ph. Vogel, Antiquities of Chamba State, Part I, Calcutta 1922, pp. 207-8, pi. XXIX. (169) Ibid., pp. 78-95. (17?) This sandstone relief, now in the Himachal State Museum, Simla, is illustrated in Ohri, Arts of Himachal, cit., see n. 150. [49] 153</page><page sequence="50">to c. the 8th century (171), would be dedicated to S?rya-N?r?yana (and it may explain the presence of 'N?r?yana' imagery on the great 8th century S?rya temple at Martand, Kashmir) (172). To conclude, it is not unlikely that two stimuli fostered images of N?r?yana in the region of Himachal Pradesh: N?r?yana's role as royal progenitor and his position as supreme Being of the P?ncar?trins, who were prevalent in the area. An unexpected source evincing the popularity of 'N?r?yana' images in the Northern regions is the Buddhist texts, the Lalitavistara. A passage included in Chapter VIII, tells that the young Siddh?rtha visited a temple (devakula), and viewed a number of divine images there; N?r?yana is one of them. The interesting aspect of this passage is that the Lalitavistara is believed to be a Buddhist text composed in the North. The text probably was in the process of formulation somewhere between the 4th century to c. the 8th century A.D. (173). Here then is a literary passage which elegantly corroborates the popularity of N?r?yana's worship in the North as indicated by the Northern icons, beginning with the 427 A.D. 'N?r?yana'. In the course of this lengthy exploration of Northern vaisnava art in order to determine the provenance of the 427 A.D. bronze, quite another issue has arisen. Art of the Northern areas made during the 5th-7th century is essentially an art that is post Gandh?ran and pre-Kashmiri. The probings made above comment upon existing enclaves of art during this time and wherefrom come their influences. It is usual to ground analyses of the art of this time on comparisons with Swati and early Kashmiri art, especially in the case of bronzes. If the proposed provenance of the 'N?r?yana' bronze is accepted, then the region of Himachal Pradesh must be recognized not only as a producer of a very early vaisnava bronze, but the earliest 'N?r?yana' type image known to date to originate in the North. Moreover, Himachal Pradesh seems to have been an active enclave for Hindu art during this time, receiving influences rather quickly from the Gangetic Valley. The art produced in the Himalayan valleys does not appear to be a pastiche of outside (i.e. Gandh?ra and Gangetic) influences; (171) Ohri, Western Himalayas, cit., pp. 50, 151. (172) A figure on the north side of the inner wall of the hall in front of the main shrine is described by Debala Mitra (Pandrethan, Avantipur, andMartand, Delhi 1977, pp. 100-101) as follows: '[...] the figure [...] has [...] leonine and boar-like side heads representing Sahkarsana and Aniruddha [...] the front placid face stands for Vasudeva [...] Between the legs appears the bust of Prthvi. The attributes in his hands are not very distinct [...] From old photographs of this relief it appears that above the man-lion-boar heads there is a pile of seven more heads in three rows, two rows having three each and the top only one. In that case, the image most probably stands for Visvar?pa Visnu'. (173) A 4th century A.D. Chinese translation of the Lalitavistara is mentioned in Nanjio, Bunyio, A Catalogue of the Chinese Translation of the Buddhist Tripitaka (Oxford 1883), No. 160. See J.W. De Jong, 'L'episode d'Asita dans le Lalitavistara', Asiatica, Festschrift F. Weiler, Wiesbaden 1954, especially p. 313; cited by G. Fussman {Annuaire du College de France 1989-1990, p. 623) to support the 8th century dating of the text. 154 [50]</page><page sequence="51">local traditions play a role in artistic expressions. In addition, artistic diffusion need not go only from the artistic centers of Gandh?ra and the Gangetic Valley to the Himalayan peripheries; influences can be expected to move among and between the peripheral valleys. The larger theoretical issue raised in the process of finding a home for the 5th century 'N?r?yana' bronze is the possibility that the mountain valleys below Kashmir may be very early repositories of a Hindu art which synthesizes, rather dynamically, divergent influences from North and South. V. Other Iconographic Context of the N?r?yana Type (DMS) Not all the 'N?r?yana' icons discussed so far are solitary images devoid of additional iconographic clues to establish the meaning of the type, especially the lateral animal heads. It has already been observed in connection with the c. 7th century Bajaura Visvar?pa that the core of a Visvar?pa icon can be based on the iconography of the 'N?r?yana' type. Visvar?pa iconography probably developed in the Mathur? school of art as indicated by the Gupta Bhankari Visvar?pa with its lateral lion and boar heads (174). But Visvar?pa need not have lateral animal heads; lateral crowned human heads can also occur. The association of N?r?yana with Visvar?pa is not due to P?ncar?tra theology. Already a passage in the Mah?n?r?yana Upanisad giving adoration to N?r?yana attributes to him hugeness, the result of being filled with the totality of creation; in a word, the passage attributes to N?r?yana a visvar?pa nature (175). One Visvar?pa example that does have lateral animal heads goes a long way towards weakening the suggestion that the lateral heads are associated with the avat?ras. The Visvar?pa reputedly from Bhusawar in Rajasthan has been recently published by Maxwell (176). Bhusawar is in eastern Rajasthan, near to Bharatpur, a town which, in antiquity, was within the cultural orbit of Mathur?. The central Visvar?pa figure retains the Bhankari iconography showing the lion head on the right and the boar head on the left. The central figure is surrounded, inter alia, by a depiction of ten avat?ras represented in two vertical sets of five. On the right side (174) Maxwell, Visvarupa, cit., pp. 136-41 can be consulted for a detailed description; however the identification of Agni in the nimbus must be taken with caution. (175) See J. Varenne, La Mah? N?r?yana Upanisad, Tomes I-II, 2nd ed. Paris 1986, vv. 235-236, 251-252. For an interpretation of this text and the evolution tracing the omniform nature of Vedic Purusa unto N?r?yana, see Srinivasan, Many Heads..., cit., chapt. 10, entitled 'M?rtis and the Mah?n?r?yana Upanisad'. In this chapter I discuss the philological and religious evidence to support dating this text to the time around the beginning of the Christian era. (176) See T.S. Maxwell, 'The Visvarupa Sculpture from Bhusawar at Bharatpur', in Eastern Approaches, cit., pp. 155-67. [51] 155</page><page sequence="52">Fig. 22 - Halo of a vaisnava image. 8th-10th century.

Photograph American Institute of Indian Studies. of Visvar?pa and second from the bottom is a depiction of Var?ha; on the left side, second from the bottom, is a depiction of Nrsimha. For Maxwell, the depiction of the Var?ha and Nrsimha twice as avat?ras (in the lateral heads and in the outer o margins of the stele) suggests 'a late phase in the development of the iconographic type' (177); he dates the image to the 11th century. For me the outer depictions of the Var?ha avat?ra and the Nrsimha avat?ra hint that the boar and lion lateral heads o ? may not also represent the same avat?ras. Happily the Bhusawar sculpture is not the only sculpture with such repetitions. The Devsar halo (Fig. 22) from Kashmir, presents a great many relevant details. This magnificent elliptical halo displays a hierarchy of divine manifestations. At the apex stands the cosmic source of these manifestations, a multi-headed, multi-armed vaisnava figure whose lowermost three heads are a lion and a boar to the right and left of a human head (Fig. 23). Below the multi-headed deity, and on either side of the halo, (177) Id., 'Bhusawar Visvar?pa', cit., p. 165. 156 [52]</page><page sequence="53">are a series of vibhavas or avat?ras in roundels. In the two uppermost roundels, to the right and left of the central apex, the Var?ha avat?ra is represented. On the right, Var?ha is shown rescuing the Earth; on the left, Var?ha kills Hirany?ksa, the cause of Earth's plight. Below this roundel appears Nrsimha destroying the demon who would not worship Visnu, Hiranyakasipu, the brother of Hirany?ksa. The halo is older than the Bhusawar sculpture, alerting straightaway to the possible trouble for Maxwell's opinon that a decline in iconographic integrity may be responsible for more than one boar and lion representation in the piece from Bhusawar. J.L. Bhan places the halo in the early 8th century (178). Goetz dates it between the 9th and 10th century (179), and Pal assigns it to the 10th (180). Thus the halo is at least a hundred years older than the Bhusawar Visvar?pa, and, of course, it is from a region considerably closer to Himachal Pradesh, the proposed provenance for the inscribed 'N?r?yana' bronze. At the apex, the Devsar halo features a figure that incorporates the 'N?r?yana' type; below this figure, it depicts the lower aspects of divine forms. Even this abbreviated description of the halo fits quite well into the P?ncar?trin schema of higher and lower levels of pure creation. It is therefore advisable to try and determine the halo's larger iconographic program into which the 'N?r?yana' type has been incorporated. If the meaning and significance of the divine forms above and below the 'N?r?yana' type can be determined, the conceptualization of the latter ought to be advanced. The complete vaisnava figure at the apex has ten arms and seven visible heads arranged in three rows (Fig. 23). The top row has one head of the horse Hayagriva. The second row has three human heads with crowns. The third and lowest row, is the one with the typical heads of the 'N?r?yana type'. The figure has many other iconographic characteristics which, throughout this paper have been attributed to 'N?r?yana'. Between the god's feet is a tiny figure of Bh? Devi. 'N?r?yana's' lowermost arms rest on his personified attributes; Gad?devi is on his right and Cakrapurusa is on his left. The emblems in the other pairs of hands are (going upwards): lotus and conch, sword and club, stylus and book, sun and moon discs (181). The figure on top of the halo is some sort of vaisnava cosmic deity. One indication of its cosmic nature is the intensification of multiple bodily parts (182), in this case multiple heads and arms. The Devsar halo seems to display a sequence of creation (178) See J.L. Bhan, 'Manifestations of Visnu ? A Critical Study of an Eighth Century Prabhavali from Devsar, Kashmir', in Vaisnavism in Indian Arts and Culture, ed. Ratan Parimoo, New Delhi 1987, pp. 362-95.

(182) Ibid., chapters 11, 18, 22. [53] 157</page><page sequence="54">beginning with the cosmic deity at the apex and ending with the series of vibhavas or avat?ras. Indeed, the halo's composition specifies that the entire sequence begins with the entity represented by the horse's head. There is sufficient evidence to propose that the horse's head (Hayagriva), symbolizes N?r?yana, the Supreme, all-inclusive god of the P?ncar?trins. Let me immediately eliminate any confusion by directing the reader's attention to the fact that throughout this paper I have referred to the deity of the inscribed bronze as 'N?r?yana' ? in quotes. The point is that the deity of the bronze is N?r?yana's highest {para) form in the Highest Heaven (Vaikuntha); as such, the deity is the first of his five modes of existence, but the deity is not N?r?yana, the transcendental Being per se. Hayagriva is the alter-ego of god N?r?yana in the Mah?bh?rata. Specifically, in the N?r?yaniya section of the Mah?bh?rata, N?rada the devotee of N?r?yana, praises the god in the form with the equine head. And N?r?yana recounts his own exploits in the horse-head form: in the northwestern ocean he drinks sacrificial oblations offered to him with faith (12.326.56); he preaches the wisdom of the Vedas even to Brahm?, who then worships him (12.327.81-82). In the Ramacandra Sastri edition of the N?r?yaniya account, Hayasiras (i.e. Hayagriva), is described in terms that recall the Vedic cosmic Purusa (183), whose image also inspires the description of Visvar?pa-N?r?yana in the same text (see below). It is true that already in the Mah?bh?rata, Hayagriva is an avat?ra and he becomes a god of learning especially associated with P?ncar?tra knowledge (184). The Visnudharmottara allies him to both higher and lower levels of creation; it states that Hayagriva is Samkarsana, and that he saved the Vedas in a previous age (185). Admittedly, both the date and place of the Visnudharmottara''s composition make it a highly appropriate source for the interpretation of the iconography of this Kashmiri sculpture dating between the 8th-10th century. But I am quite sure that the topmost position of Hayagriva in a halo whose theme is divine unfolding obviates the possibility for Hayagriva's identity as the vy?ha Samkarsana, or as the avat?ra. Being at the pinnacle, Hayagriva can only refer to N?r?yana himself, as the N?r?yaniya proclaims. Incidentally, Hayagriva, the avat?ra, does appear in the Devsar halo, but in the appropriate place. He is seen in one of the roundels, that is, in one of the spaces reserved for avat?ras. Beneath the head of Hayagriva are seen the three crowned heads. They represent N?r?yana as cosmic totality. To state it otherwise, these three heads metonymically express the P?ncar?tra belief that N?r?yana is cosmogonic totality. The image for (183) A.-M. Esnoul, Narayaniya Parvan du Mahabharata, Paris 1979, p. 63, re chapt. XIV (Mhbh. XII.347). (184) S. Jaiswal, 'The Demon and the Deity: Conflict Syndrome in the Hayagriva Legend', in Vaisnavism in Indian Arts and Culture, cit., p. 43. (185) P. Shah, Visnudharmottara-Pur?na. Third Khanda. Vol. II, Baroda 1961, p. 158, re: Adhyaya 80. 158 [54]</page><page sequence="55">cosmogonic totality can be a Visvar?pa image. Therefore we may say that the three crowned heads symbolize N?r?yana as Visvar?pa. It will be remembered from the above discussion, that a Visvar?pa image may have lateral animal heads or three (visible, though intentionally four) crowned heads. Perhaps the best examples of Visvar?pa with the crowned human heads are the 6th century series made in S?mal?ji (186). It may be well to summarize the symbolism of the two rows of heads on the apex of the halo. The two rows of heads represent the beginning of a cosmic progression leading towards pure creation. The progression begins at the point where all is the One, namely N?r?yana. The first emanation represents the One as omniform Creator; this is the Visvar?pa form which contains all other forms of creation. The two Beings, namely N?r?yana and Visvar?pa-N?r?yana, form a unit. This unit, an ideograph for the creative potentiality of the transcendental Supreme, is already represented in the Bajaura relief. Only at Bajaura the horse's head (Hayagriva), rests above a Visvar?pa whose lateral heads are animals, not human. (The 5th century Visvar?pa on the Gadhwa [U.P.] lintel may be coalescing the unit; here Visvar?pa's central head may be that of the horse while the side heads are of the boar and lion) (187). The Visvar?pa recently acquired by the Metropolitan Museum (Fig. 24; No. 1986.506.15) also shows the horse's head of Hayagriva above the human, central head of Visvar?pa. The Met Visvar?pa displays some stylistic features reminiscent of V?sudeva-Krsna from the Dharmar?jik? and the one from the British Museum (see Figs. 2-3 mentioned in n. 87), together with the group related to these two sculptures. The crown of the Met Visvar?pa has the shape and interior cross-hatching as in the crowns of this group (cf. Fig. 14). Also the lotus with the raised seed pod, observed with some icons in this group, is being held in Visvar?pa's upper raised right arm. Although the Met Visvar?pa is later than the above vaisnava group assigned to the 6th century, it is unlikely to date beyond the 8th century. Here then is an addition to the growing number of Hindu icons from the Taxila area made between the post-Gandh?ra and the pre-Karkota period in Kashmir. The cosmogonic progression depicted on the Devsar halo continues with N?r?yana's highest or para form. As this form precedes even pure creation, it is the embodiment of the undifferentiated N?r?yana. God in this highest form is Para V?sudeva (188). The three-headed god with lateral animal heads, appearing beneath the three crowned heads of Visvar?pa, is Para V?sudeva. God in his para form comes to be mentioned in the original P?ncar?tra literature, although it is intimated earlier. If we assume with Schr?der that the terminus ad quem of the original P?ncar?tra Samhit?s is the (186) S.L.

[55] 159</page><page sequence="56">8th century (189), and if we remember that the Devsar halo has been dated anywhere between the 8th and the 10th century, then associating this cosmic form with this particular name does not pose a problem. Para V?sudeva's potentiality to initiate pure creation is declared by his lateral animal heads which represent the second and fourth vy?has. Avat?ras and vibhavas, according to P?ncar?tra cosmogony, are deities belonging to a lower category of pure creation than Para V?sudeva and the caturvy?has. This theological distinction is visually expressed in the Devsar halo, again by way of position within the overall compositional schema. Those deities, being partial manifestations of Para Vasudeva, are shown in roundels which are literally below Para V?sudeva. The Devsar halo is thus a splendid and clear expression of the steps in P?ncar?trin theology leading to, and effectuating, pure creation. The cosmic figure at the apex shows that N?r?yana is both the Supreme and the efficient cause of pure creation. N?r?yana manifests himself as Para V?sudeva, who in turn emanates the vy?has, who carry out subsequent stages of creation. Beneath the cosmic figure, and in a series of roundels, is the second level of pure creation represented by the vibhavas or avat?ras. The clarity of the halo's composition is an additional indicator that the lateral animal heads must be vy?has and not avat?ras. First, the heads occur with Para V?sudeva, who marks the juncture between primary and secondary pure creation. Second, the double appearance of the boar and lion is analogous to Hayagriva's upper (i.e. N?r?yana) and lower (i.e. avat?ra) appearances in the overall compositional schema. As such, the visual distinctions between the upper placement of the lateral lion and boar heads, and the lower occurrence of Narasimha and Var?ha is logical only if the lateral animal heads are understood to be vy?has. Perhaps the halo's clarity of expression is related to the fact that the theological progression it portrays is already given, in a rudimentary manner, in a pre- or early Gupta text. The N?r?yaniya section of the Mah?bh?ratas S?nti Parvan (i.e. Book XII), dated c. late 3rd-early 4th century A.D. (190), exposes a system of thought which it labels, quite consciously, as P?ncar?tra. An exposition on cosmogony and the nature of N?r?yana is given to the sage N?rada who witnesses an epiphany of the Supreme N?r?yana on the White Island (Svetadvipa). N?r?yana first shows his visvar?pa form (XII.326.1), manifesting his thousand eyes, hundred heads (191), thousand feet, thousand bellies and arms (XII.326.6, 7), etc. This vision of Visvar?pa O Ibid., p. 19.

(191) 'One hundred' heads signifies 'the ultimate number' of heads. In the artistic rendering of a visvar?pa image, the 'ultimate number' can be expressed by the basic three ( = four) faces plus as many other faces as the artist can make.

[57] 161</page><page sequence="58">N?r?yana is modeled upon the visvar?pa form of Vedic Purusa (in RV 10.90), the ancient omniform creator upon whom so much of vaisnava imagery is based. Then N?r?yana displays the form of V?sudeva, who is described as 'the highest Self {param?tman), 'the eternal One' (san?tana; XII.326.24). The vy?has emanate next (e.g. see XII.326.35-39; 68-69), and they are called his 'fourfold form' {m?rticatustaya XII.326.43) (192). After these emanations, the rest of creation proceeds from Brahm? who has arisen from Aniruddha, the fourth vy?ha. First come the avat?ras, the Boar (var?ha) and Man-Lion (narasimha), heading the list (see XII.326.72-96). The N?r?yaniya's cosmological sequence parallels, in its fundamental outline, that of the Devsar halo; both the literary and visual progression proclaim a monotheistic starting point, N?r?yana, for the ensuing divine manifestations. What is more, both intimate that there is a connection between the Supreme N?r?yana and the origin of the universe. Indeed both offer the same two connections: Brahmanic visvar?pa followed by the P?ncar?tra four vy?has (although this term is not in the N?r?yaniya). Mallmann considers Visvar?pa the syncretic form of the Caturvy?ha because the texts she analyzed attribute the same animal heads to both. She declares, and I agree, that the four faces of Visvar?pa correspond to the four directions, the Caturvy?has, and to the attributes (guna) of the Supreme V?sudeva (193). (I presume she is referring to para V?sudeva). It is important also to realize that although the N?r?yaniya does not yet specifically refer to Para V?sudeva, it contains several concepts associated with this form of N?r?yana. First, the form between the Visvar?pa form and the (192) These are V?sudeva, Samkarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. It may be pointed out that V?sudeva is not mentioned twice; thus this passage does not sharply distinguish between para V?sudeva and vy?ha V?sudeva. Also noteworthy is that this is not the only fourfold emanation arising from N?r?yana in the account of the N?r?yaniya. N?r?yana's fourfold form is also said to be born in the house of Dharma (cf. XII.322.2). These forms have different names; they are Nara, N?r?yana, Hari, and Krsna. The difference between these two sets has been well set forth by Esnoul (N?r?yaniya, cit., pp. 18, 60). She specifies that the vy?ha forms are cosmic in nature, whereas the dharma forms approach an avat?ra nature since they contribute to the increase of righteousness (Dharma) in the world. This digression on N?r?yana's two sets of fourfold forms is made because it may relate to two sets of iconographic conventions in the depiction of Visvar?pa. The depiction of animal or human heads as vy?has has already been dealt with, above (one more human headed caturvy?ha will be cited below). But some Visvar?pa icons, notably from Deogarh and Kannauj feature four lateral animal heads that seem to represent the four avat?ras (i.e. Fish, Tortoise, Boar and Lion); see Maxwell, Visvar?pa, cit., fig. 5.1, table 6.1 and table 6.2. Recently two more examples, a 9th century one from Bengal and a 10th century one from Bihar have been discussed by G. Bhattacharya, 'A Unique Visnu Image from the National Museum of Bangladesh', South Asian Archaeology 1989, Madison 1992, pp. 317-26. The fluidity in the iconography of a vaisnava Visvar?pa image could perhaps reflect N?r?yana's multiple fourfold nature as expressed in the N?r?yaniya. The digression is not meant to reopen the debate on the lion and boar lateral heads as avat?ra heads in connection with Para V?sudeva-N?r?yana or Visvar?pa. It may be well to reiterate Mallmann's observation, namely that the four faces (two of which she cited as animal faces) in the Caturvy?ha and Visvar?pa icons originally refer to the vy?has and subsequently to the avat?ras. (193) Mallmann, LAgni Pur?na, cit., pp. 19-21. 162 [58]</page><page sequence="59">'fourfold form' is described as V?sudeva param?tman. Second and most significantly, this form of V?sudeva is distinguished from the fourfold form wherefrom the vy?has emanate. This distinction is made in the P?ncar?tra literature, although not at all times (see n. 12). The theological distinction between Para and Vy?ha V?sudeva is of course the basis for assuming that the distinction also occurs in the iconography. Both the N?r?yaniya and the Devsar halo proclaim that the higher form of V?sudeva is linked to transcendental 'N?r?yana' and Visvar?pa. The linkage between these three entities (i.e. transcendental N?r?yana, Visvar?pa and Para V?sudeva) is the preservation of the totality of N?r?yana. Each entity is beyond pure creation. The four vy?has, beginning with Vy?ha V?sudeva, initiate pure creation. Therein lies the fundamental distinction. The correspondence between the N?r?yaniya's cosmological progression and the iconographic program of the Devsar halo, though much later in time, assists in solving the problem stated at the outset: the Devsar halo places the iconic type depicted in the 427 A.D. bronze, into a hierarchical framework similar to the one given in the N?r?yaniya, the earliest relevant P?ncar?tra exposition. Fortunately, the N?r?yaniya is not the only text which is nearly contemporary ? or contemporary ? to this bronze. There are other textual references that advance the interpretation of this type of image, and these are considered in the concluding section, below. VI. Interpretation and Identification of the 427 A.D. Type of Image (DMS) A passage in Patala 6 of the Jay?khya Samhit? (JS) describes how the mental image of N?r?yana should be conceived. This is a P?ncar?tra text produced in the later Gupta age, and possibly the centuries following this age. Therefore its prescriptions have relevancy for a P?ncar?tra icon of the 5th century, labeled 'N?r?yana' (194). JS 6 73-75 prescribes that a devotee should meditate on N?r?yana who is four-armed, holds the conch, the wheel, the mace and the lotus, whose four-faces are composed of 'Vaikuntha, Narasimha, Var?ha, Kapila', and who is mounted on Garuda... (195). Patala 6 amplifies upon the conceptualizations and worship of the last three faces (JS6 135-153) (196). (194) N?r?yana's epithet visv?tman (JS, 6.69), designates him as 'the universal soul', a designation attributed to other high gods besides N?r?yana. See S. Sorensen, An Index to the Names in the Mah?hh?rata, repr. Delhi 1978, p. 730. Thus I cannot agree with Maxwell (see n. 22), on the expanded name for N?r?yana. The dating of the JS is discussed by the editor of the text; see E. Krishnamacharya, Jay?khyasamhit? of P?ncar?tra Agama, No. 54 in Gaekwad's Oriental Series, Baroda 1931, pp. 26-34. See also J. Gonda, Medieval Religious Literature in Sanskrit, Wiesbaden 1977, p. 54. (195) Other features of N?r?yana which are iconographic in nature are in JS, 6.74-76. (1%) See Maxwell ('Vaikuntha', cit., pp. 146-51), for the text and translation of Patala 6. [59] 163</page><page sequence="60">This passage has enormous importance for the interpretation of the iconic type analysed in this paper. On the one hand, we have a text produced roughly around the Gupta period, assigning and naming the four heads of god N?r?yana. On the other hand, we have the 427 A.D. bronze showing three heads of the god named N?r?yana in the inscription on the bronze. It appears that a three headed image may well represent a four-headed concept (197). We are clearly not dealing with numerical, but rather symbolic quantities. Still, it is fair to ask why the early period should have represented mainly three-headed images. No definite answer to this question is on record. However, what is on record is an apparent difference of opinion on the correct number of vy?has. The Mah?hh?ratas N?r?yaniya may be reflecting the opinion of different P?ncar?tra schools, or different beliefs within a given school when it indicates theoretical divergences on whether there are one, two, three or four vy?has (see XII.336.53). Evidently, the theological codification of four vy?has had still not occurred by c. the 3rd century A.D. I am therefore not so sure that too much can be made of the fact that, between the 3rd-5th century A.D., there is one four-headed image (from Mathur?, see below) and six three-headed images (from Mathur?, see Fig. 9, and in Maxwell, Visvar?pa, figs. 40, 42, 43, 45, and from Himachal Pradesh, Fig. 1). Perhaps this is the time to remember that as late as the 8th century, a passage in the Visnudharmottara Pur?na contains ambiguities on the number of vy?ha faces (see n. 8). At this stage in our understanding of the image type, it seems reasonable to conclude that the three heads of the 427 A.D. bronze (and all the early three-headed images of this type mentioned in Sections III-IV), represent the vy?ha concept also associated with a four-headed divinity. The names of the heads supplied by the Jay?khya Samhit? underscore who this divinity is. The P?ncar?tra text mentions that the first face of N?r?yana is that of 'Vaikuntha', that is V?sudeva, as I already suspected in an earlier study (198). It is now possible to refine my hunch and add that Vaikuntha refers to para (not vy?ha) V?sudeva: 'The most prominent figure in the "Highest Heaven" [or Vaikuntha] is God Himself in His para or ''highest'' form, which is the first of his five prak?ras or modes of existence, the other four being the Vy?has and the three kinds of Avat?ras [...]' (199). According to this information given by Schr?der, 'Vaikuntha' refers to para V?sudeva (197) Now that we have a Gupta three-headed P?ncar?tra icon labelled as 'N?r?yana', the icon must be viewed in relation to the roughly contemporary JS (see n. 194). Prior it was unclear whether a precise mental image of a four-faced 'N?r?yana' could elucidate the iconography of Gupta three-faced icons. Therefore Maxwell ('Vaikuntha', cit., p. 128), had dated the JS to the 8th century to coordinate with the date that the four-headed icon became integrated with the P?ncar?tra. The fact that the JS places the god on Garuda and that Garuda does not appear on the 427 A.D. bronze is not sufficiently critical to prevent application of the text's information to the 427 A.D. bronze.

The answer, given by the Jay?khya Samhit? and the Devsar halo, is that the other faces represent the vy?has, or the modes of existence coming right after, and out of para V?sudeva. The Jay?khya Samhit? specifies ? not once but twice in Patala 6 ? that two of these faces have animal names. Only one conclusion is possible: The animal names cited (i.e. Narasimha and Var?ha) are names referring to the vy?has. The Devsar halo, it will be remembered, featured animal heads which represent vy?has, and it is thus a visual example of this conclusion. The Amarakosa, a lexicon dated to c. 500 A.D. seems to be aware of the Caturvy?has. The text mentions V?sudeva, Samkarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, in that sequence (200). This sequence is in the caturvy?ha order, that is, it is the sequential order in which the vy?has emanate. This passage justifies Fig. 25 - V?sudeva with emerging Vy?has; from Mathur?. Early 3rd century. Mathur? Museum (Nos. 392-395). another significant interpretive point. Here the vy?has are all assigned human names. The Jay?khya Samhit? assigns animal names to the second and fourth vy?ha. If these two texts manifest alternate ways of referring to the vy?has, it ought to follow that the art could do the same. It does ? in the same place and at about the same time. For close to thirty years now, there has been scholarly agreement that a late Kushan statue made in Mathur? represents V?sudeva and three vy?has emanating from him (Fig. 25). Though this is a fragmentary statue, the fragments all appear to be human forms. Limiting myself only to details relevant to the present problem (201), it is possible to identify the main figure as V?sudeva (202), to his right (200) D.C. Sircar, chapter on 'Vaishnavism' in R.C. Majumdar et al., eds., The History and Culture of the Indian People, Vol. III. The Classical Age, Bombay 1954, p. 423. (201) Further details, and bibliography are in Srinivasan, 'Caturvy?ha', cit. (202) It has been usual to assume that the figure represents vy?ha V?sudeva, and the entire statue is generally identified as a 'Caturvyuha' image. I also identified this piece as a 'Caturvyuha' (see Srinivasan, 'Caturvy?ha', cit., 39 ff.). I am no longer so certain that the V?sudeva figure represents a vy?ha. It [61] 165</page><page sequence="62">(and emanating from him) is the vy?ha Samkarsana; from V?sudeva's crown arises a broken bust that ought to represent the vy?ha Pradyumna, and the broken segment on the left side of V?sudeva ought to have originally represented vy?ha Aniruddha. It is but recently that the three-headed Florida image (Fig. 9) has been published and therefore it has not yet been compared to the fragmentary form of V?sudeva and the emanating vy?has (Fig. 25). The Florida image was made in Mathur? probably not more than 50-75 years after the image-in Fig. 25. However in the Florida image the second and fourth vy?has are represented by the alternate lion and boar animal heads. The Florida image, dating to the late 3rd/early 4th century A.D. raises a question not previously formulated. At the time the image was made (i.e. prior to, or, at the beginning of the Gupta period), are there examples in Mathur? sculpture of the boar and lion in contexts unequivocally indicative of the avat?ra concept? One relief of a Var?ha exists; no examples of Nrsimha are known to date (203). Isn't this another indication that the right lateral head of the Florida image from Mathur? (Fig. 9), cannot represent the Nrsimha avat?ra since this avat?ra has not yet been given a separate iconographic reality in Mathur? art by the 3rd/4th century A.D.? In sum, the interpretation of the type represented in Figure 1 can proceed on the assumption that its three heads equal a four-headed concept, and, that its animal heads can signify, just as human heads, the notion of vy?has, a hallmark of P?ncar?tra ideology. The inscription of the 427 A.D. bronze states that it is an image of N?r?yana. We know now that N?r?yana allows himself several evolutions before his totality seems to me that the figure could also be Para V?sudeva and three vy?has which emanate from him. Para V?sudeva appears to display an intensification of multiple bodily parts, whereas the vy?ha does not seem to (see below). Perhaps a comparative study of the type called Para V?sudeva-N?r?yana in this paper, and the type called caturvy?h?tmaka in the Nepalese dedicatory inscription (see below) will clarify this important point. Such a study would probably commence with the important bronze recently gifted to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art (Fig. 26). It is a small (ht. 2 5/8"), bronze from Kashmir, based on the sarvatobhadrika model. Four deities, facing the cardinal directions, surround a central pillar, topped by a lotus. Its importance lies in the fact that it seems to represent an intermediary. The bronze may portray Para V?sudeva-N?r?yana together with three other standing figures of the type called caturvy?h?tmaka in the Nepalese example (see below). A number of features of this small bronze tally with the iconographic expression of the S?dhaka's dream state of awareness of the Supreme God in P?ncar?tra practice. (See S. Gupta, 'Yoga and Antary?ga in P?ncar?tra', in Ritual and Speculation in Early Tantrism. Studies in Honor of Andre Padoux, ed. T. Goudriaan, New York 1992, p. 200).1 The expression features a central luminous pillar, topped by a lotus; the four vy?ha forms are envisaged around the pillar, facing the four directions. Here, the central pillar symbolizes the Supreme God, and the lotus, his sakti. To advance theological correspondences in the art forms, it almost seems necessary for a P?ncar?tra specialist to collaborate with an art historian. (203) See D.M. Srinivasan, 'Vaisnava Art and Iconography at Mathur?', in Mathur?: The Cultural Heritage, gen. ed. D.M. Srinivasan, New Delhi 1989, pp. 387-88. I do not consider the Var?ha image in the Los Angeles Country Museum of Art (No. M72.53.8) to date the Kushan Period; it belongs in the Gupta Period. 166 [62]</page><page sequence="63">(his N?r?yana-ness) is broken apart into vy?has (lit. orderly arrangements). What evolute of N?r?yana is the bronze? The cosmic figure at the apex of the Devsar halo portrays an evolute which looks very similar to the form of god depicted in the 427 A.D. bronze. The theological significance of this form is strongly suggested by the halo's iconographic progression. The form represents god's oneness before it is eclipsed through differentiation into the four vy?has. Extant P?ncar?tra literature justifies calling the halo's form Para V?sudeva. Can justification be found to call the deity represented in the 5th century bronze by the same name? The answer seems to be 'yes &gt; ^ we are attentive to the information provided by the Jay?khya Samhit?. This Gupta text, it is well to reiterate, admonishes the worshipper of N?r?yana to meditate on this god, by meditating, inter alia, on Vaikuntha, Narasimha, Var?ha and Kapila. The text strongly suggests that the incipient P?ncar?tra ideology is coming into place. Accordingly, it is proposed that meditation on para V?sudeva (i.e. Vaikuntha) and the vy?has heads emanating from him is being advanced in the JS. Then too, there is the slightly older N?r?yaniya passage which mentions V?sudeva param?tman as that form of N?r?yana which precedes the vy?has. I believe that the main deity in the 427 A.D. bronze represents the theological notions which the P?ncar?tra texts come to associate with Para V?sudeva. Because of that and because Vy?ha V?sudeva can be theologically distinguished from N?r?yana's Para evolute, the name given to this type should reflect these considerations. Amalgamating, thus, inscriptional and theological evidence, the 427 A.D. image is of N?r?yana as Para V?sudeva, or Para V?sudeva-N?r?yana (204). There are those who may object to this (cumbersome) name on the grounds that giving an icon a name that appears in texts several centuries later is problematic (203). I am aware of this concern. However, since numerous features foreshadowing Para V?sudeva can be documented earlier, it seems far better to call this P?ncar?tra type of image by the name reflecting precisely its theological position in the P?ncar?tra belief system. An image of Para V?sudeva-N?r?yana represents the visible form of N?r?yana poised to usher in cosmogony. The god displays this capability by exhibiting the vy?has, instrumental in achieving pure creation. A capability is a potential for some end result; it is different from the end result itself. In the same way, an image of Para V?sudeva-N?r?yana, displaying the vy?has as they arise from him, ought to be different from an image of the four fully arisen vy?has. An early Nepalese image (204) The following aforementioned 'N?r?yana' images may therefore be called Para V?sudeva N?r?yana; the Florida 'N?r?yana*; the Berlin 'N?r?yana'; the Mathur? terracotta 'N?r?yana' [Visvar?pa, fig. 45); probably the Masrur 'N?r?yana' and the Nirath 'N?r?yana'; the Boston Museum of Fine Arts 'N?r?yana' [Visvar?pa, fig. 42) assuming the complete image would be like another Mathur? Para V?sudeva N?r?yana (fig. 43 in Visvar?pa), and, the Adi Sakti Devi 'N?r?yana'. (205) jj-^g 'ls pOSition of my colleague, Dr Lore Sander. [63] 167</page><page sequence="64">confirms this assumption. Enshrined in the N?r?yana Hiti, Kathmandu, is a four sided image. Carved on each side is the full anthropomorphic figure of one of the four vy?has; each is represented with one head and four arms, holding the appropriate attributes. Another iconographically similar image but of the 16th century, names this type of representation caturvy?h?tmaka in the dedicatory inscription. Slusser, who published the earlier 'Caturvy?ha' image in the N?r?yana Hiti dates it to the 7th century on stylistic grounds; she therefore must be rejecting the implications of a textual entry that may refer to this piece and would place it in the mid 5 th century (206). The Nepalese examples suggest that a Caturvy?ha image is a fourfold image featuring four fully evolved forms which do not show intensification of multiple bodily parts. Instead each vy?ha shows only the multiplication of one bodily part. Para V?sudeva-N?r?yana is quite different. In a theology which emphasizes, by subtle degrees, the evolutionary distance between the transcendental N?r?yana and the first manifestation of the transcendental, the iconography of Para V?sudeva N?r?yana affirms his minimal distance from the Supreme N?r?yana. The early imagery consists of one figure with multiple heads and arms, that is, the imagery shows intensification of multiple bodily parts which is a sign of a cosmic being (207). The idea is that Para V?sudeva is still N?r?yana, the One who is not yet divjfled into a fourfold arrangement. But division is immanent. The emanating lateral heads are beginning to project. The highest personal god of the P?ncar?trins, Para V?sudeva, or manifest N?r?yana, stands before the devotee as the supreme expression of the unaffected, unchanging One whose very nature augurs the changes leading towards creation. This is the god represented in the 427 bronze made in Himachal Pradesh and fashioned even earlier in the art of Mathur?. This god is also represented in the Kashmiri votive bronze, inlaid with copper and silver, whose figures are arranged in the sarvatobhadrika manner (Fig. 26). The essential features traced and assigned to Para V?sudeva-N?r?yana throughout this paper can be attributed to one standing figure; this is the main figure of the fourfold icon; it probably faced East. The other three standing figures can be distinguished from Para V?sudeva-N?r?yana due to the absence of the multiple heads and Bh? Devi (Fig. 27). As in the Nepalese caturvy?h?tmaka, they do not show intensification of multiple bodily parts; each figure has four arms only. These figures represent vy?has. Therefore I am inclined to call the newly acquired Nelson image 'Para V?sudeva-N?r?yana with Vy?has'. To date I know of no other image which combines the para aspect of N?r?yana with the fully arisen Vy?has. Thus, this small c. 9th century Kashmiri image is unique albeit (206) Mary Shepard Slusser, Nepal Mandala, Princeton 1982, Vol. I, pp. 244-45; Vol. II, pis. 386-388. In a personal communication with Slusser (2.10.94), she informs me that an earlier date is possible for the N?r?yana Hiti Caturvy?ha. The 16th century Caturvy?ha is illustrated in Gail, 'Three- and Four-Faced Visnu Images', cit., figs. 1-4. (207) E.g. Srinivasan, Many Heads..., cit., chapters 11, 18. 168 [64]</page><page sequence="65">Fig. 26 - Para V?sudeva-N?r?yana with Vy?has. c. 9th century. Kashmir. Gift of Robert H. Ellsworth to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. In honor of the appointment of Doris Meth Srinivasan as curator. Fig. 27 - Para V?sudeva-N?r?yana; Vy?ha. theologically quite unproblematic. That is not its only significance. Recognizing that this image is based upon developments which had been worked out previously in the Mathur?/Himachal Pradesh axis (see below) and in Nepal, this small image gives added support that art in the Himalayan valleys evolved as a result of influences stemming from both local and distant centers. Is it possible to concretize part of the totality of transcendental N?r?yana? From a Western perspective, giving form to that which is beyond form and can itself create form, verges on the paradoxical. From the Hindu perspective, representation of the transcendental in iconic form does not defy reason; indeed, such an icon enables the most spiritually advanced worshipper to gain realization of the Supreme. Several examples in Saivism come immediately to mind. There is the Lihga icon which is the symbol of the Absolute, Para Siva, the transcendental One. There is also the fifth [65] 169</page><page sequence="66">head of the Pancamukha Linga, declared to be even beyond the ken of yogis yet rendered, albeit infrequently, in visual form (208). It therefore comes as no surprise that Vaisnavism may also have icons which concretize certain forms of god that are imperceivable to the ordinary mortal. For the P?ncar?trins, N?r?yana in his Para V?sudeva form is one such portrayal. This paper comes to the conclusion that the art of two localities provides the earliest evidence for the worship of Para V?sudeva-N?r?yana. The first locality is Mathur? (Fig. 9 etc.; perhaps Fig. 25). This is to be expected since Mathur? during the first few centuries of the Christian era is the innovator par excellence of vaisnava art and iconography (209). The second locality, Himachal Pradesh (Fig. 1 etc.), could be viewed as an unexpected place for vaisnava innovations were it seen in isolation. If however, it is viewed as an area in close contact with Mathur? and responsive to the artistic inventions there, then the occurrence of a new vaisnava form in the hills not more than a hundred years after its formulation in Mathur? is unremarkable; indeed its occurrence could even be viewed as part of a pattern. In a short addition to this paper, which I hope to write fairly soon, I can demonstrate that not too much time is lost between the formulation of a new vaisnava image in Mathur? and its production in some Northerly workshop within Mathur?'s radiating sphere of influence. Would the devotee of long ago, in either locality, recognize Para V?sudeva in a single guise only? The modern scholar strives to carve out consistencies. Being far removed from the evocative ambiguities and multivalent symbols of a living, growing faith, he seeks definitions in texts and inscriptions, and hesitates before deviations (210). But early P?ncar?tra displays ambiguities and overlapping symbols which seep into iconography (cf. n. 8, 12, 202 and pp. 54 and 59-60). The scholar sees but three heads or four heads, animal heads or human heads, Para V?sudeva or Vy?ha V?sudeva. The adept would have seen them too, but ? as likely as not ? he may have seen more. The devotee may have understood the significance of fluid symbols, allowing for ambiguities. Should we discount the possibility for layered meanings and thereby restrict our scope of understanding? (208) The 15th century R?pamandana is often quoted to explain why the fifth head so seldom is depicted. Yet, it is carved in stone at the earliest stage of Hindu iconography. The Bhit? Pancamukha Lihga, dated to the 2nd century B.C. portrays the fifth head, called Is?na. (209) Srinivasan, 'Vaisnava Art', cit. (210) What happens when definitions based on texts and inscriptions are superceded by definitions based on visual distinctions is demonstrated by the paper of G. Bhattacharya, 'Unique Visnu', cit. For example, the Mathur? type with emanating human vy?has (Fig. 25) is considered a type distinct from the Mathur? type with emanating animal heads from the Gupta period (his fig. 38.4). The author calls the Late Kushan sculpture (Fig. 25), V?sudeva-caturvy?ha and decides to name the Gupta piece Visnu Vaikuntha (his fig. 38.4), apparently unaware, or not bothered by the fact that Vaikuntha can be a name of V?sudeva in P?ncar?tra texts. 170 [66]</page></plain_text>
