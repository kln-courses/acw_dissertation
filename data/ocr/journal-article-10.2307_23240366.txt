Human history, Adorno empha sises, is grounded in the material forces of nature: 'external' nonhuman nature, and 'internal' human nature (particularly the instinct for self-preservation). Concomitantly, nature is 'historical', in that it evolves and changes, but also because it has been profoundly shaped by human history. By underscoring the entwinement of nature and history, Deborah Cook argues, Adorno's concept of 'natural history' offers a 'template for interpretative practice' in philosophy. But it also functions as a thoroughly critical concept, by making visible the damage inflicted upon nature. Cook's aim is thus to elucidate the dual role - interpreta tive and critical - that 'natural history' plays within Adorno's work. Due to its admirable clarity, the book will be extremely useful to those unfamiliar with Adorno. At the same time, Cook's meticulous analysis of Adorno's texts and her discussion of secondaiy literature will also be of great interest to scholars well versed in Adorno's work. She divides the book into five chapters: four expository, whilst the fifth brings Adorno into critical conversation with some key environmental philosophers. Chapter 1 clarifies Adorno's materialism. Cook's main argument is that Adorno's concept of 'natural history' supplements his thesis about 'the pre ponderance of the object' by demonstrating the dynamism of the subject/object relationship. Her second key point is that whilst our 'affinity' with nature is fundamental to Adorno's philosophy of nature, he places an equal emphasis on Environmental Values 21.2</page><page sequence="2">241 BOOK REVIEWS non-identity. This, Cook contends, enables a more nuanced position regarding human freedom, distancing Adorno from the mechanistic position of Orthodox Marxism. She thereby lays the groundwork for explaining the possibility of transformation in Adorno's philosophy later in the book. Chapter 2 continues with the themes of affinity and non-identity by exploring their epistemological implications. Like Kant, Cook explains, Adorno asserts that conceptual me diation constitutes a 'block' to our understanding of nature, and he postulates an objective residue that cannot be subsumed by the conceptual apparatus of the subject. Adorno's notion of 'affinity', however, sets him apart from Kant, because it implies that this gap is not unbridgeable. On the other hand, Cook argues, Adorno's 'natural history' thesis demonstrates how this affinitive bridge is blocked not only by conceptual mediation but also by the adversarial stance towards 'external' nature which has predominated through human history. She also explains how humans have adopted a similarly antagonistic stance towards our own 'internal' nature, outlining Adorno's appropriation of Freud's theory of instincts, and his speculative account of the development of human self-consciousness and reason. According to Adorno, the negation of internal instinctual nature has inculcated the deluded impression of subjective mastery over both internal and external nature, as something alien, to be conquered. Chapter 3 sets out Adorno's advocacy of 'non-identity thinking' as a means of transforming our destructive relationship with nature. By subsuming natural objects under concepts without remainder, 'identity thinking', (as Nietzsche similarly argues), seeks 'to make all being thinkable, to force it to yield and bend to us' (p. 70). Adorno's 'non-identity thinking', aims, in contrast, at yielding to the object. However, Cook strongly emphasises Adorno's warn ing against fetishising the object. Adorno understands all thought as an 'act of negation': therefore a simple immersion in nature or objectivity is impossible. 'Non-identity thinking' aims, rather, to use the negative movement of thought in a non-instrumental and critical way. Cook gives a detailed and illuminating account of how 'non-identity thinking' operates, involving 'determinate nega tion' of existing states of affairs, an 'emphatic' use of concepts that strives to unleash the potential of 'damaged life', and attending to 'constellations' of concepts to 'unlock' the object. Having considered how we might think differently, in Chapter 4 Cook ad dresses the possibility of resistive action. She begins by outlining Adorno's defence of the individual as a potentially resistive and critical force, and his understanding of the isomorphism between 'identity thinking' (which subsumes the particularity of natural things under universal concepts) and capitalistic exchange relations and labour processes (which subsume the particularity of individuals under abstract exchange value). The problem, as Adorno sees it, is that under the monopoly conditions of late capitalism, the critical force of the individual has been 'emptied out'. Whilst the principle of individuation remains, Environmental Values 21.2</page><page sequence="3">242 BOOK REVIEWS individuals 'no longer have any semblance of autonomy with regard to eco nomic conditions' (p. 95). This fosters the formation of weak, submissive and narcissistic egos, which damages the potential for interpersonal relations, and hence, collective action. Adorno claims, therefore, that whilst political action is urgently required, under the conditions of monopoly capitalism it must be deferred. Yet, whilst acknowledging Adorno's scepticism towards forms of col lective action, Cook attempts to counter the 'tired charges of pessimism' made against Adorno, by referring back to his account of 'non-identity thinking' as a transformative strategy. The final chapter compares Adorno and three representatives of 'radical ecology' - Arne Naess, Murray Bookchin and Carolyn Merchant - and covers various themes within environmental philosophy, including anthropomorphism and the idea of intrinsic value. Whilst acknowledging the differences between Naess, Bookchin and Merchant, Cook argues that each ends up championing holistic accounts of nature, privileging unity to the detriment of natural diversity. She concludes that Adorno offers a more promising approach to the problem of unity and diversity, and suggests that his philosophy points towards new forms of solidarity that can accommodate differences between people whilst engendering a unity of purpose. Cook thoroughly succeeds in demonstrating the relevance of Adorno to contemporary environmental philosophy. Her defence of his work as a stra tegic resource, and of his faith in the efficacy of reason, however, is perhaps less convincing. Her insistence that 'the precondition for radical change is the sustained self-critical spirit of reason' (p. 115) for example, arguably does not give enough space for experimental action. I also contest Cook's deployment of 'history' in the collective singular throughout the book. At a couple of points, Cook does acknowledge criticisms of Adorno's monolithic historicism, but in general, she rather uncritically repeats Adorno's totalising claims about 'human history', which arguably contravene his own philosophy of heterogeneity. As such, Cook (like Adorno) overlooks the possibilities that alternative and hetero geneous histories can open up for conceptualising and engaging differently with human and nonhuman nature. Despite these reservations, however, I thoroughly recommend this lucid and engaging book, which arrives on the scene during a time of surging interest in materialism, 'speculative realism' and 'object oriented philosophy'. Adorno's work has much to offer contemporary philosophical debates regarding the 'turn to the object', and Cook's exposition and analysis will greatly facilitate attempts to bring Adorno into the conversation.
