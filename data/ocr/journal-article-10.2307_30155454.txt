<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CANNIBALISM OF PUPAE BY ADULT FLOUR BEETLES1 THOMAS PARK, DAVID B. MERTZ,2 AND MICHAEL NATHANSON Hull Biological Laboratories, University of Chicago INTRODUCTION WE ARE concerned with the ecol- ogy of flour beetles. An in- trinsic component of this ecol- ogy is cannibalism, often a potent source of mortality generated by the population itself. The present paper contributes fur- ther to this problem. In the research re- ported here, we examine, in a new way, the consumption of pupae and callow adults by mature beetles. The biblio- graphic background for this work was comprehensively reviewed by Park et al. (1965). That paper also discussed other predatory pathways in Tribolium cul- tures (larvae eating eggs, adults eating eggs, larvae eating pupae) and advanced a partial evaluation of the role played by such cannibalistic processes in regulating population abundance. In the Park et al. (1965) study, 20 pupae were exposed to 20 adults, and the number of the former that were eaten per unit time was determined for various ex- perimental conditions. Two species of flour beetles, pupae and adults, were used (T. confusum Duval and T. casta- neum Herbst), and there were four genet- ic strains of adults for each species (see Park, Mertz, and Petrusewicz, 1961; Park, Leslie, and Mertz, 1964). This gave a total of 16 factorial treatments (2 adult species X 4 adult strains X 2 pupal species = 16) with 10 replicates per treatment. In half the replicates (80), the predators associated only with pupae of T. confusum; in the other half (80), only with pupae of T. castaneum. Five con- clusions were established: (1) that can- nibalism did indeed exist and ranged from moderate to intense; (2) that T. castaneum was characteristically more voracious than T. confusum; (3) that, for both species, strain of adult was cor- related with predatory appetite; (4) that strains "b-I" and "b-IV" of T. confusum showed a slight, albeit non-significant, "preference" for the pupae of T. casta- neum; and (5) that T. castaneum showed a decided, and highly significant, "pref- erence" for the pupae of T. confusum. The experiment just outlined raises numerous questions that suggest further investigation. We list several of these. In Park et al. (1965) the predators were given no choice between species of prey. We should like to know whether selective predation continues to operate when both species of pupae are present in the same vial of flour-a matter of obvious importance for any understanding of 1 We are greatly indebted to Dr. P.

Also, no infor- mation emerged from prior work regard- ing the possible relation between number of pupae at risk of being eaten and actual rate of cannibalism. This is a realistic issue, because in a true population the numbers of all stages are continually changing. Finally, in Park et al. (1965), the pupae were distributed evenly (sys- tematically) from top to bottom in the flour-clearly an artificial dispersion pat- tern from the beetles' point of view. To seek answers to these questions, two new experiments were carried out. These form the substance of the present ume, architecture, and nutritive quality. The beetle stages are introduced into this habitat, as will be clarified later, and censuses are taken by merely sifting the flour through bolting cloth in order to separate the living from the non-living material. The reader is referred to the general paper of Park (1962) for a broad- er discussion of the rationale and the analytical power of this technique. The Tribolium used in these studies were not infected with the noxious sporo- zoan, Adelina tribolii (Park, 1948), and there is no compelling reason to believe that other detrimental species of para_ TABLE 1 TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY CHARACTERISTICS OVER THE SPAN OF THE TWO EXPERIMENTS DEGREES CENTIGRADE RELATIVE HUMIDITY (%) EXPERIMENT Mean - sE SD CV N Mean+ SE SD CV N Pupal distribution (1966) ..... 28.83h+0.16 0.70 2.4 20 72+1.90 8.48 11.8 20 Pupal proportion (1965) ...... 29.09+0.12 0. 3 2.5 39 75+0.95 6.00 7.9 40 report. For convenience, we refer to one of these experiments as "pupal distribu- tion" and to the other as "pupal propor- tion." They have identical spatial, troph- ic, and climatic conditions, generally similar husbandry and technical pro- cedures, and similar strains. The designs of these experiments will be discussed in the appropriate sections. TECHNIQUE In much of the work conducted in this laboratory, including the present re- search, a standardized "universe" has been adopted. This is a shell vial which contains a medium consisting of a mix- ture of 95/% fine-sifted whole-wheat flour and 5% brewer's yeast. This medium, in a quantity of 8 g, fills the vial to a certain depth and thereby creates a cylindrical habitat that is defined in terms of vol- sites were present in the stocks and strains. The final technical point concerns the climatic environment. In many prior studies emanating from this laboratory, populations have been maintained in darkened incubators regulated to a tem- perature of approximately 29 C and to a relative humidity of approximately 650%- 70i%. The same conditions prevailed in this experiment. The control actually achieved in the incubator for the two experiments is recorded in Table 1, from which we conclude that the temperature and humidity differences between years were negligible as far as the biology of the beetles was concerned. The populated vials were kept in trays on an incubator shelf, and the position of each vial was determined in advance by randomization. Also, all vials con-</page><page sequence="3">230 THOMAS PARK, D. B. MERTZ, AND M. NATHANSON taining flour were preacclimatized (29 C, 70% relative humidity) for at least a week before receiving the living stages. THE STRAINS In conducting the current experiments, we purposely used only two of the eight available strains. These are designated "b-I" (Tribolium confusum) and "c-IV- a" (T. castaneum). The strains were chosen for several reasons, the principal one being "populational"-that is, con- cerned with census history through gen- eration time. As single-species cultures, b-I sustained much larger immature and mature populations than c-IV; yet, in competition and somewhat paradoxical- ly, c-IV won 90% of its contests (Park et al., 1964). Strain c-IV had a higher "intrinsic rate of increase" (r = 0.560 per 5 days) than b-I (r = 0.522) and was decidedly more cannibalistic (Park et al., 1965). It was this entertaining array of biological contrasts between the strains that had led earlier to their use in anoth- er populational study shortly to be pub- lished (Leslie, Park, and Mertz, 1968), in which initial numbers of adult beetles were proportionately varied in a fac- torial fashion. The adoption of these two strains was thus dictated by considera- tions which not only appeared interesting in their own right but also were directly related to the general program-an un- derstanding of competition. It should be recorded here that the original c-IV underwent some genetic change during its long employment in this laboratory. The matter was compre- hensively documented by Mertz (1965), who called the derivative strain "c-IV- a." Since this is basically the strain used in the present investigation, we sub- scribe to Mertz's nomenclature. Among other things, the variant T. castaneum has a higher intrinsic rate of increase (r = 0.640 instead of 0.560 per 5 days), which reflects its observed greater fecun- dity, fertility, and faster development. It is likely, also, that our current c-IV-a differs in some respects from that studied by Mertz. Furthermore, it is likely that our current b-I has diverged somewhat from its predecessor. But, despite such inevitable capriciousness, the two strains of both species continue to resemble their original selves more than they resemble any other strains known to us. RESULTS: THE PUPAL-DISTRIBUTION EXPERIMENT INTRODUCTION The objective of this phase of the study was to assess the cannibalism of pupae and callows by adult beetles when (1) a constant number of adults of each species forage as the predator, (2) an initially constant number of pupae of each species are at risk of predation, and (3) an initially constant number of pupae of each species are dispersed within the flour in three different patterns. The design of the experiment is ex- plained in the four left-hand columns of Table 2. There were 12 experimental (predatory) treatments in which beetles and pupae shared the same 8 g of flour; 6 control (non-predatory) treatments in which only pupae were present, and 2 control (non-predatory) treatments ir which only adults were present (see bot- tom of Table 2). In all cases, where ap propriate, 50 adult beetles and 100 younu pupae were used. The design is com- pletely factorial. In half of the experi mental replicates (treatments 1-6) the predators were Tribolium castaneum c-IV-a (hereafter "c"); in the other hal (treatments 7-12) the predators wern T. confusum, b-I (hereafter "b"). Th, replicates were further partitioned sq that in half of them (treatments 1-3 7-9) the prey was T. confusum and in th other half (treatments 4-6, 10-12), 1</page><page sequence="4">CANNIBALISM OF PUPAE 231 castaneum. The quiescent pupae were distributed at the start of the experiment in three ways: "top" (T) signifying within the upper 4 g of the total 8 g of flour, "even" (E) signifying evenly within the 8 g, and "bottom" (B) signifying within the lower 4 g of the total 8 g. With reference to distribution, the treatment code numbers are, re- spectively, T: 1, 4, 7, 10; E: 2, 5, 8, 11; B: 3, 6, 9, 12. For each experimental trols, giving for the six treatments a total of 60 replicates, and 10 replicates for each of the adult-only controls, giving for the two treatments a total of 20 rep- licates. We mention now the problem of hus- bandry. The number of pupae and adults needed to launch this investigation and, even more, the timing of both stages to obtain the desired ages were logistical maneuvers of no minor stature.

The primary components of the design were as follows: adult predation by species, pupal and callow vulnerability by species, and pupal (and perhaps cal- low) vulnerability by distribution. The secondary components ("interactions") will be discussed later. There were 10 replicates for each of the pupal-only con- specific requirements for the total ex- periment are shown in Table 3, and these sum to 23,200 individuals-a sub- stantial amount of coleopterous proto- plasm! The adult predators had been sexed earlier as pupae, so that a sex ratio of exactly 25 males to 25 females could be established in each vial. The pupal prey were not sexed but were withdrawn at random from "farm stocks" known to have (statistically) a sex ratio of unity. We stipulated that the adults be young</page><page sequence="5">232 THOMAS PARK, D. B. MERTZ, AND M. NATHANSON but still old enough to be fully sclero- tized and reproductively competent. To achieve this, a post-eclosion beetle age of 10 days was taken as the target. The pupae, when introduced into the flour, had to be as young as possible in order to maximize the interval of their exposure to cannibalism. The actual ages of adults ranged from 6 to 15 days, with a median age of 10.4 days. This satisfied us. The actual ages of the pupae ranged from 2 to 14 hr, with a median age of 6 hr. This, though not perfection, also satisfied us. The first replicates were started on June nibalism, whether as pupae or as callows. In reasoning this way, we assert that none of the original 50 adults died during the 10.5-day period, an assertion shown to be quite justified from inspection of the appropriate controls (adults alone, bottom of Table 2). We have a further check on the reliability of this reasoning, since in certain treatments (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12) the surviving adults were not the same species as the predatory adults, a fact which permits the two sets to be discriminated and counted. This check validated our assumption of negligible TABLE 3 HUSBANDRY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PUPAL-DISTRIBUTION EXPERIMENT ADULT PREDATORS PUPAL PREY CATEGORIES cco c9 9 boo b 9 c9 b Predatory treatments..... 1,350 1,350 1,350 1,350 5,400 5,400 Pupal controls......................... 3,000 3,000 Adult controls........... 250 250 250 250 Total.............. . 1,600 1,600 1,600 1,600 8,400 8,400 24, 1966; the last, on July 2. All popula- tions remained undisturbed in their incu- bator for 10.5 days. This afforded ample time for a surviving pupa to become a callow and for a surviving callow to be- come a mature adult. In other words, the complete duration of predatory vulnera- bility was encompassed within the span of 10.5 days. In this context it is well to point out that throughout this paper "predation on pupae" is really a contrac- tion for "predation on pupae and cal- lows." At the time of census, the flour was sifted and counts were made of the num- ber of living adults. Aware of the fact that initially there were 100 pupae and 50 beetles per vial, we took the number of adults in excess of 50 to be that num- ber which had successfully survived can- mortality on the part of the predators. We then started the experiment. The work was programed so that there were nine "blocks," each block being initiated on consecutive days. (Originally there were 10 blocks, but one was lost.) Thus, the first block consisted of one replicate for all predatory treatments (1-12); the second block, of another replicate for all treatments; and so on through nine replicates. The control treatments fol- lowed the same time schedule; that is, they were replicated among blocks. In constructing the mixed populations, the immobile pupae, as already ex- plained, were introduced either in the top half of the medium (T), the bottom half (B), or evenly throughout (E). The top distribution was created by pouring 4 g of flour on a sheet of paper and spading</page><page sequence="6">CANNIBALISM (OF PUPAE 233 this 10 times from around the perimeter to the center with a spatula. This flour was then funneled into an empty vial. Next, a second 4-g sample was poured on the paper, over which 100 pupae, ap- propriately aged and speciated, were gently scattered on the surface. Again, the spatula was used in the same way for the magical 10 times, and the resulting combination of medium and prey was funneled on top of the barren 4 g. The bottom distribution was created in an identical fashion, except that the 100 pupae were mixed with the first 4 g of flour. The even distribution was achieved simply by mixing 50 pupae with the bottom 4 g and 50 pupae with the top 4 g of flour and combining the two samples in one vial. Owing to the technique used of spading and funneling, it seems proba- ble that the pupae enjoyed an essentially random dispersal within their respective quotas of flour for all three distributions. However, we have no direct proof that this was true. We recognized in advance one logical inconsistency in the design of the three treatments. In the top and bottom dis- tributions the beetles foraged for pupae in only 4 g of flour, while in the even dis- tribution the same number of prey was dispersed in twice the volume. This in- consistency, however, did not disturb us in terms of the questions we were asking, a priori, of the experiment, and, as we shall see, the empirical findings can be interpreted in relation to distribution pattern. After a block of nine replicates had received its pupae, 25 male and 25 female beetles of the appropriate species were placed on the flour, into which they readily tunneled. The vials were returned to the incubator for 10.5 days, and the study was under way. RESULTS The basic data summarizing the find- ings are tabulated in Table 2, in which survival by treatments is recorded. The data can be viewed as percentages, since in all cases exactly 100 pupae were pres- ent when the 50 beetles were introduced. For example, an entry of 73 in the mean column denotes that, on the average for the replicates of that treatment, 73 pupae and callows escaped cannibalism and developed to mature beetlehood, while the remaining 27 were destroyed by the adults in one stage or the other. Mor- tality, instead of survival, could have been used as our index. This has logic to recommend it in a study whose primary emphasis was on predation and in which "selective predation" (killing a greater number of one species of prey than the other) was an important part of that emphasis. But survival seems to have more cogency in terms of general ecology, and so we chose this measure in prefer- ence to its counterpart. We assessed selective predation through the some- what derived figure of differential per- centage survivorship. This is not the same thing as analyzing, say, differences, or ratios, of numbers killed for each species of pupa. But by focusing on sur- vivorship we gained something. We dealt with selective predation in terms of dif- ferential recruitment, its most important populational consequence. In addition to mean + standard error, Table 2 also lists the standard deviation, the coeffi- cient of variability, and the maximum and minimum. Let us first dispose of the control populations. We have already stated our conclusion that there was no appreciable mortality among 20 cohorts of 50 beetles of both species whose survival was fol- lowed from the sixth to the twenty-sixth day of imaginal life. The same conclusion</page><page sequence="7">234 THOMAS PARK, D. B. MERTZ, AND M. NATHANSON holds true for the 60 cohorts of 100 pupae (treatments 13-18). If one examines these treatments, it is evident that the pupae, and later the callows, reached maturity with only negligible deaths. Further, neither pupal species (b or c) nor distribution pattern (T, E, B) bore any relation to survival when adults were not present. Accordingly, we argue that, whenever a mean value in Table 2 is re- duced below 100 for any of the 12 experi- mental treatments, such a reduction is a direct consequence of cannibalism. This argument, though convincing, is more than circumstantial, because we routine- ly observed corpses of pupae and callows that clearly displayed the scars of man- dibular attack. We now turn to the experimental treatments (Table 2). The most striking conclusion was the over-all superiority of Tribolium castaneum over T. confusum as a predator. If one ignores pupal species and distribution pattern and engages in the dubious arithmetic of averaging the six means for treatments 1-6 (c-IV-a adults) and then comparing this average with the one for treatments 7-12 (b-I adults), the values will be, respectively, 37.9 and 67.4. That is, survival differed by about 30%, depending on which species was the cannibal. A similar result was obtained by Park et al. (1965). There, the comparable percentages were 30% (c-IV adults) and 68% (b-I adults) -quite a remarkable conformity, all things considered, between the old and the new values. The next point concerns the relation between species of predator and species of prey-a relation which is diagram- matic and straightforward but not as yet understood in terms of mechanism. Anthropocentrically stated, T. confusum adults preferred T. castaneum pupae and callows, while T. castaneum adults pre- ferred, by a greater margin, T. confusum pupae and callows. The relevant survival percentages, derived from Table 2, ap- pear in the following tabulation: b feeding on b ..... 76% (74%) b feeding on c ..... 59% (62%) c feeding on c..... 55% (45%) c feeding on b ..... 20% (16%) The figures in parentheses were adapted from Park et al. (1965) and show more than casual agreement with present find- ings. It should be remembered that the earlier study differed in at least three re- spects: (1) the T. castaneum strain (c-IV) was characterized by a lower intrinsic rate of increase than the current deriva- tive strain (c-IV-a), (2) the initial seed- ings of adults to pupae were 20: 20 in- stead of 50:100, and (3) the pupal prey were "Chicago Standard" rather than b-I and c-IV-a. Despite these differences, however, species predilection is demon- strated again and must be reckoned as a component of the Tribolium "ecosystem" -certainly in short-term studies such as these and probably in ongoing popula- tions. The data just presented disclose a phenomenon without illuminating its causation. If, as we like to think, such predatory selectivity operates in a sus- tained way in mixed-species populations, then it must play a pregnant role in the regulation of numbers and, subsequently, in the determination of competitive out- comes. From the point of view of the population's ecology, this is the impor- tant aspect. Happily, it is testable and awaits further investigation. Also testa- ble is the underlying mechanism. With reference to this, there are several rea- sonable hypotheses which are not neces- sarily mutually exclusive. We denote these as "developmental rate," "disper- sion pattern," and "perception and at- traction." The first is primarily intrinsic and physiological; the last two, primarily behavioral. Let us pursue the matter.</page><page sequence="8">CANNIBALISM OF PUPAE 235 Developmental rate asserts that, since' the pupae and callows of b take longer to develop than those of c, they are there- fore at greater risk of being eaten. This is in harmony with the fact that c adults consume more b prey than c prey, but it is not in harmony with the alternative of b eating more c. The hypothesis assumes, rather dubiously, that pupae and callows of both species are equally susceptible to attack, quite irrespective of their age. In other words, it is exclusively the total duration of the interval from pupation to eclosion to maturity that is critical; a pupa, say, 4 days old is as vulnerable as one, say, 1 day old. Had b pupae always been eaten more voraciously than c pupae, the rate hypothesis, taken as a comprehensive explanation, would be at- tractive indeed. We now comment about dispersion pattern. It is known from general experi- ence in this laboratory, and more specifi- cally from the studies of Ghent (1963, 1966), that T. confusum and T. casta- neum, as populations, distribute them- selves in a somewhat dissimilar way within their cylinders of flour. The mat- ter is complicated and not fully under- stood, but it appears evident that nei- ther random, nor vertically systematic, dispersal holds true for either species. These points suggest, a priori, that pre- daceous selectivity of prey could be re- lated, not to developmental rate or "at- traction," but rather to geography-to the location of immobile pupae as this is related to the movement of adults. Let us illustrate the matter by a purely hypo- thetical example. Suppose that the larvae of species X tend to pupate more often in upper levels of the flour and that adults of species Y also tend to feed there more often. This would increase the proba- bility of X species pupae being en- countered. A different dispersion could be imagined which would increase the cannibalism of Y pupae by X adults. Such differential movement by the two species could lead to survival trends of the sort actually seen in Table 2, that is, to some confirmation of the hypothesis itself. It was this consideration, of course, that led to the inclusion of top, even, and bottom treatments in the present experi- ment. The perception-and-attraction hy- pothesis asserts that a mechanism oper- ates in the populations which permits c adults and b adults to discriminate partially between b and c immatures and then behave so that c consume signifi- cantly more b (in the statistical sense) while b consume significantly more c. Al- though such behavior would explain rath- er elegantly the observations reported in Table 2, we have in fact no convincing evidence that it really exists. But, as suggested earlier, the hypothesis is testa- ble, and plans for further study are pro- jected. Granting the existence of such a mechanism, the causation could be ol- factory, tactile, or morphological. Olfac- tory assumes that the pupae of the two species are characterized by different odors to which the adults sometimes re- spond, either positively or negatively. Tactile assumes that an adult, on en- countering a pupa in the flour, has some capacity to determine, by actual contact, the species of its intended prey. Mor- phological assumes that, for some struc- tural reason, the pupae of b are more readily killed and/or destroyed when at- tacked by c, and alternatively. Be all this as it may, the real ecological point merits restatement: If such predatory selection is present in mixed-species populations, it is a phenomenon to be reckoned with quite apart from the un- derlying causation. It will be remembered that cohorts of 100 pupae were dispersed in one of three ways: top, even, or bottom. We now ask</page><page sequence="9">236 THOMAS PARK, D. B. MERTZ, AND M. NATHANSON how such distributions are related to sur- vival of pupae in the presence of adults (Table 2). The findings are clear cut, indeed diagrammatic. Tribolium confu- sum is relatively somewhat more effec- tive as a predator in the upper half of the flour. In other words, pupal survival in- creases from top to even to bottom, the respective means being 71%, 72/%, 84% (for b prey) and 537%, 57%, 66% (for c prey). But, curiously enough, the trend is exactly the reverse for T. castaneum! These adults are more effective as con- sumers in the lower half of the flour; that gluttony (c &gt; b) and selectivity of prey (b preferring c, c preferring b) are not obfuscated by the dispersion treatments. Let us now consider the data from the statistical point of view. First, we inspect the coefficients of variability listed in Table 2. For the most part, these values are rather low, at least for experiments of this sort. In other words, the replicates are encouragingly homogeneous, with the outstanding exception of treatment 3, for which the coefficient is 108%. This treatment is discrepant for the amusing reason that the T. castaneum predators, TABLE 4 ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE OF THE PUPAL-DISTRIBUTION DATA USING THE ARC SINE TRANSFORMATION Source of Variation df Mean Square F P Treatments: Species of adult ................................. 1 9625.58 300.14 &lt;0.0001 Species of pupa .................................. 1 1036.57 32.32 &lt;0.0001 Distribution of pupae ....................... . 2 295.35 9.20 &lt;0.0001 Species of adult X species of pupa ..................1 7841.64 244.51 &lt;0.0001 Species of adult X distribution of pupae............. 2 1698.23 52.95 &lt;0.0001 Species of pupa X distribution of pupae ..............2 1.41 0.04 &gt;0.05 Species of adult X species of pupa X distribution of pupae ....................................... 2 29.48 0.91 &gt;0.05 Total treatments ............................... 11 Residual ....................... ........ .......... 96 32.07 Over-all total ...... ......... ................. 107 is, survival of pupae (of both species) de- creases from top, to even, to bottom. Here the respective means are 32%, 18%, 10% (for b prey) and 73%, 510%, 42% (for c prey). Clearly, both b and c beetles are foraging throughout the total volume of flour, since some cannibalism exists wherever pupae are situated. How- ever, one species (b) either is more effi- cient, is more industrious, or lingers longer when in the top zone, while the other species (c) is one, or all, of these things to a greater degree when in the bottom zone. Thus, distribution and survival are obviously correlated, but, despite this, the differences in predatory when faced with the strategic combina- tion of T. confusum pupae dispersed within the bottom zone, were so vora- cious that in five of the replicates they consumed virtually all the prey. For the entire set of nine populations, the sur- vival percentages are as follows: 0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 14, 17, 18, and 32. The 108 replicates comprising the 12 experimental treatments lend themselves to a single analysis of variance, which is summarized in Table 4. Because the data take the form of percentages, and be- cause the numbers range widely from 0 to 91, we adopted the arc sine transfor- mation in performing the computations.</page><page sequence="10">CANNIBALISM OF PUPAE 237 (An identical analysis using non-trans- formed data did not change any inter- pretation.) The conclusions are straight- forward. Significant contributions are made by species of adult, species of pupa, and distribution of pupae, and the F- values mirror the relative magnitude of these contributions.

Solid lines signify that the prey was T. confusum; broken lines, T. castaneum. Three major conclusions, sta- tistically supported, are readily apparent from inspection of the figure: 1. Voracity of predators (confirmation of an earlier finding).-T. castaneum is char- acteristically more predaceous than T. confusum. 2. Choice of prey (confirmation of an earlier finding).--Adults of T. confusum consume more pupae and callows of T. castaneum than of T. confusum. Contrari- wise, adults of T. castaneum consume, to an even greater degree, more pupae and callows of T. confusum than of T. castaneum. 3. Distribution of prey (new finding).- Location of the pupae in the flour is re- lated to their survival. If T. confusum is the predator, the trend is toward in- creased survival (i.e., lower cannibalism) from the top to the bottom zone. However, if T. castaneum is the predator, the trend is toward increased survival (i.e., lower cannibalism) from the bottom to the top zone. RESULTS: THE PUPAL-PROPORTION EXPERIMENT INTRODUCTION The objective of this, the second phase of the study, was to measure the canni- balism of pupae and callows by adult beetles when (1) a constant number of adults of each species forage as the preda- tor; (2) both species of pupae are present together in the same vial of flour; (3) the pupae of both species are distributed in their flour in a "natural" pattern, as will be explained below; (4) the initial total number of pupae is varied in three ways; and (5) the initial proportion of pupae of species b to species c is varied in three ways. The design of the experiment is pre- sented in Table 6. In every case, as was true for the work just reported, 50 ma- ture beetles, always of one species or the other, constituted the predatory cohorts. The pupae (actually larvae; vide infra) were introduced into the flour in the fol- lowing proportions for all treatments: 100% c:0% b, 75% c:25% b, 50% c: 50% b, 25% c:75% b, and 0% c: 100% b. This sequence established both single and mixed-species populations of prey. For the first and the last members of the sequence, the predators were given no choice of species on which to feed; for the other three members, a choice did exist. In terms of total numbers of pupae, the populations were started either with 50, 100, or 200 individuals. There were five replicates for each of the 30 treatments, or 150 factorially partitioned replicates for the entire study. Apart from species of adult predator, the primary elements of the design were pupal vulnerability by species, pupal vulnerability by total numbers, and pupal vulnerability by pro- portions. The last category raises a ques- tion concerning cannibalism which had not been studied before in this labora- tory. The secondary elements ("interac- tions") will be discussed later in conjunc- tion with the statistical analysis of the data. We also ran pupal-only controls. There were two replicates for each of the 15 control treatments, or a total of 30. In these controls, the pupae were present in the same total numbers and proportions that characterized the predatory, or ex- perimental, cultures. No adult-only con- trols per se were run. We assumed adult mortality to be negligible for the dura- tion of the experiment (see Table 2). However, this assumption was amply justified by those six treatments in which</page><page sequence="12">CANNIBALISM OF PUPAE 239 all predators were of one species and all prey of the other species. For these 30 replicates, adult mortality was essential- ly zero; actually, during the tenure of the experiment, none of the 750 Tribo- lium confusum, and only three of the 750 T. castaneum, adults died. The husbandry requirements for this experiment were as follows: (1) 3,750 T. confusum adults (b-I), (2) 3,750 T. casta- neum adults (c-IV-a), (3) 8,750 T. con- fusum larvae, (4) 8,750 T. castaneum larvae, (5) 1,750 T. confusum larvae (for the controls), and (6) 1,750 T. castaneum larvae (for the controls). Thus, 28,500 living stages were needed to conduct this investigation. Larvae, rather than pupae, were used to initiate the experiment. The larvae tunnel actively through the flour until they are nearly ready to pupate. At this time they are turgid and immobile ("prepupae") and quickly transform into pupae. We thus reasoned that the larvae, by virtue of their own movements, would generate a distribution of pupae for both species which would bear more than superficial resemblance to that generated by a true population. It seemed desirable to us to examine cannibalism when such conditions prevail. Obtaining the requisite larvae posed a considerable problem, because the two species develop at different rates (c faster than b) and therefore do not become pupae simultaneously. The experiment demanded that all larvae be completely mobile when placed on the surface of the flour and yet pupate, later, essentially in unison. After preliminary exploration, the following plan proved feasible. Tri- bolium castaneum larvae for Replicate-i of all appropriate treatments were hus- banded so that they ranged in age from 14 to 16 days; T. confusumn larvae ranged in age from 16 to 18 days. This program maximizes the chance that pupae of both species will emerge more or less at the same time. The larvae themselves, of course, displayed variability in size. In order to reduce heterogeneity between replicates (and treatments), we assorted the larvae visually into parcels consist- ing of all representative sizes and intro- duced these parcels into the vials ac- cording to the instructions specified in the design. Second pools of larvae were husbanded for Replicates-2, and so on through Replicates-5. The five "blocks" of replicates were started approximately 1 week apart in each case. This was necessary in order to obtain larvae prop- erly aged for both species and desirable in order to equalize the work load. Since larvae cannot be sexed, we relied on chance to provide an essentially 50-50 distribution of males to females. Each vial received its allotment of 50 beetles (30-40 days of adult age) im- mediately after the larvae had been placed in the flour. The beetles were not sexed as pupae but were withdrawn at random from a stock pool known to have a sex ratio of unity. The vials were then returned to their incubator, and the ex- periment was under way. The counts of all adults-the founders plus those that had passed successfully through the or- deal of cannibalism-were made, on the average, 20.9 + 0.34 days later. This somewhat variable interval affords ample time for the larvae to pupate, for the surviving pupae to eclose, and for the surviving callows to harden and mature. RESULTS We first consider the controls: the survival of large larvae to sclerotized adulthood when no predators are pres- ent. The data, expressed as percentages, appear in Table 5. From inspection of the table it is clear (1) that the mortality was</page><page sequence="13">240 THOMAS PARK, D. B. MERTZ, AND M. NATHANSON low, though perhaps not negligible; (2) that what mortality did obtain seems to bear no obvious relation either to total numbers or to proportions; and (3) that Tribolium castaneum exhibited a slightly higher, though not significant, over-all survival (95.4%) than T. confusum (92.9%).4 It is also true that the survival of pupae and callows in the first experi- ment (Table 2) was a little greater than TABLE 5 SURVIVAL OF PUPAE TO SCLEROTIZED ADULT- HOOD IN THE ABSENCE OF PREDATORY ADULTS ("CONTROLS") INITIAL NO.

This small difference may be ei- ther coincidental or real. We do not know. If it is real, however, a plausible explanation is that the pupation process itself is a possible hazard which could cause additional mortality. It will be remembered that in the first study, un- like the present one, the pupae were chosen and introduced into the flour after they had successfully emerged. Be all this as it may, the percentages of Table 5 (controls) greatly exceed any of those of Table 6 (experimentals). The lowest figure in Table 5 is 88%; the highest figure in Table 6 is 70'%. Ac- cordingly, we reason that reduced sur- vival in the predatory treatments was overwhelmingly the result of cannibal- ism. Let us now consider the structure of Table 6, in which the survival data are summarized. At the left of the table the 30 treatments are specified. Then the numbers of pupae and callows that escaped cannibalism are reported, for each species, as means of the five repli- cates. We illustrate the arithmetic. Take, say, Replicate-1 of the treatment, started with 38 c larvae, 12 b larvae, and 50 b adults. At the time of census some 20 days later, 16 c adults and 57 b adults were counted. In other words, 16 out of 38 c survived, and 7 (57 - 50 founding beetles) out of 12 b survived. These two figures (16 and 7), when averaged along with those from the other four compara- ble replicates, yield the entries in the second line of the table, namely, 11.60 c, 5.00 b, and 16.60 c + b. The right-hand columns of Table 6 record survival in terms of percentages-a useful way to describe the data, since it permits direct comparison of treatments irrespective of total numbers. The percentages were calculated from the mean values listed in the center columns of the table. Thus, for the same treatment used in the illustra- tion above, the three survival percent- ages are 30.5 for c (100 X 11.6/38), 41.7 for b (100 X 5/12), and 33.2 for c + b (100 X 16.6/50). The first point to establish is the re- markable voracity of T. castaneum (c- IV-a) in comparison with T. confusum SIt is reasonable to suggest that the slightly lower survival of b pupae in the nine mixed-species cohorts was due to cannibalism by recently emerged c adults. It will be remembered that c develops faster than b, and, therefore, b pupae could be vulnerable to predation for a short interval. But this effect, even if real, is too small to account for the experi- mental results shortly to be reported.</page><page sequence="14">CANNIBALISM OF PUPAE 241 (b-I). The difference is readily apparent if one merely glances at the figures in the upper half of Table 6 (b, the predator) and compares them with those in the lower half (c, the predator). To drama- tize the difference, however, we have re- arranged the data, ignoring, for the mo- ment, the contributions made by "spe- cies of prey" and "proportion of prey." This rearrangement is shown in Table 7. The third column of the table ("No. of Prey That Survive") reports the means for each of the five appropriate c + b entries contained in Table 6. The fourth column ("Percentage of Prey That Sur- vive") is obtained by merely dividing those means by the initial numbers.

If prepupae, pupae, and callows associated during develop- ment with T. confusum adults, instead of with T. castaneum adults, their chances of survival were at least doubled. This was not an artifact due to grouping the data, because all the entries in the c + b column of Table 6 are higher, for com- parable treatments, when b was the can- nibal; that is, 18.4 &gt; 5.0, &gt; 16.6 &gt; 6.0, and so on. Indeed, the trend is remarka- TABLE 7 Initial No. Species of No. of Percentage of Prey Predator Prey That of Prey That Survive Survive 50........... b 21 42 50 ............ c 4 8 100 ............ b 52 52 100............ c 19 19 200 ............ b 130 65 200............ c 63 32 50+100+200.. b 203 58 50+100+200.. c 86 25 bly consistent if b predation is compared with c predation on a block-by-block basis without any averaging whatever. Here, 75 couplets can be scored, and in only five of these is the usual situation reversed; that is, in five instances out of 75 T. castaneum was the less aggressive cannibal. Thus, we conclude that there is a marked difference between b and c adults as consumers of pupae and cal- lows. The conclusion stands by itself without the necessity of statistical analy- sis-a rather rare event in the study of population biology. This greater voracity of c over b has been noted before (in Park et al., 1965, and earlier in this paper). Even if we ignore the probable genetic changes that these strains have undergone over the years, and even if we obscure (by averag- ing) the various components of treat- ment, we can still derive two crude, but illuminating, estimates of survival that depend on which species of beetle is the predator. The estimates are roughly 60% survival of pupae and callows in the presence of T. confusum adults and 30% survival in the presence of T. castaneum adults. These percentages, a potpourri, have no exact quantitative meaning. But, in a sense, it is this very imprecision that reinforces the cannibalistic differ- ences between species. That is, despite genetic and ecological variation between experiments, one species remains more predaceous than the other. If we again examine Table 6, we note that certain treatments parallel the pu- pal-distribution experiment discussed earlier in the sense that the predators enjoyed no species choice in terms of prey. It is of interest to ask if the predi- lection of b adults for c pupae, and c TABLE 8 PERCENTAGE SURVIVAL No. OF ADULTS PUPAE c b 50b....... 50 37 52 50b....... 100 48 (59) 58 (76) 50b ....... 200 68 70 Mean ... ........... 51 60 50c........ 50 10 2 50c........ 100 39 (55) 5 (20) 50c........ 200 58 9 M ean.... ........... 36 5 adults for b pupae, still obtains. There are technical (and perhaps biological) differences between the two experiments -differences primarily involving "en- forced," as contrasted with "normal," distribution of prey. But the same predi- lection can be identified once more. If one selects from Table 6 the twelve treat- ments in which only one species of pupa inhabited the flour, the survival percent- ages are as shown in Table 8. The data speak for themselves; the predatory preference is again corrobo-</page><page sequence="16">CANNIBALISM OF PUPAE 243 rated. When b is the cannibal, the sur- vival of pupae (b &gt; c) for each of the three comparisons is not significant in the statistical sense (P &gt; .05). We at- tribute this to the small size of the sam- ple and conclude, in the light of our total experience, that the difference, though not large, is indeed a real one. When c is the cannibal, the survival of pupae (c &gt; b) is significant (P &lt; .05) despite the small degree of replication. The four numbers in parentheses in Table 8 are adapted from the pupal-distribution ex- periment, in which, it may be remem- bered, there were 50 adults to an initial 100 pupae. These numbers show the same trend. We turn now to the novel components of treatment-novel in the sense that they have not been investigated before. There are three of these: species of pupae, numbers of pupae, and propor- tions of pupae. Species of pupae has already been dis- cussed in detail from one point of view- earlier in this paper and by Park et al. (1965). In those studies, however, the foraging adults did not enjoy a choice of prey, because each vial contained only b or only c. In the experiment now to be considered, the beetles were confronted with such a choice. Both species of pupae were present together in the flour; fur- ther, their distribution was generated by prior larval locomotion rather than by us. Even so, the findings remain basically the same in that the predilection of b for c pupae, and of c for b pupae, was not obliterated by the new conditions. (The differences are significant for both preda- tors at P &lt; .0001.) This reinforces our opinion that such selectivity operates in mixed-species (competing) populations. There, pupae of both species would be dispersed by larval movements, and there, too, the numerical adjustment be- tween prey and predator would be sub- ject to continual change. Again, it is typically true (Table 6) that c adults eat a greater proportion of b pupae than b adults eat c pupae. There are exceptions to this-which we shall specify later-in- volving "numbers" and "proportions." But, over-all, for the two sets of nine mixed-species treatments, the survival percentages are 58%o b:44/% c (difference = 14%) when T. confusum is the can- nibal and 30% c:6 o b (difference = 24%) when T. castaneum is the cannibal. In other words, T. castaneum is some 10% more "selective" (24 - 14 = 10 ) in its culinary taste than its less pre- daceous rival. Should anything approach- ing this value of 10% be sustained in on- going populations, such a species differ- ence would, of itself, confer a not incon- siderable advantage for c-IV-a, T. casta- neum, when engaged in competition with b-I. Our next task is to discuss whether dif- ferential prey survival (% c - % b) is significantly affected by numbers of pu- pae and proportions of pupae. To achieve this, we used two analyses of variance: one for the 45 replicates in which T. confusum was the predator and the other for the 45 replicates in which T. casta- neum was the predator. In performing the analyses, it is obviously necessary to convert all the data to a common radix. To do this, we chose to work with per- centages, and we computed, for each of the 90 experimental populations, the per- centage survival of c pupae minus the percentage survival of b pupae (% c - %o b). This yielded predominantly nega- tive values for those replicates in which b adults were the cannibals and pre- dominantly positive values for those in which c adults were the cannibals. The averaged percentage values for all treat- ments are given in Table 9. Standard errors for each set were also calculated (SE = s/1/5, in which s is the square</page><page sequence="17">244 THOMAS PARK, D. B. MERTZ, AND M. NATHANSON root of the residual mean square). These values, 7.35 for b the predator and 4.01 for c the predator, show that the entries in the two right columns of the table are significantly different in terms of their deviations from zero. The summary of the two analyses of variance is contained in Table 10. Along with this we will dis- cuss the separate, but ancillary, topic of whether prey survival considered by species (% c or % b surviving) is affected by numbers of pupae and proportions of pupae.

In starting the experiment we in- troduced 50, 100, or 200 pupae (then larvae) into vials supplied with 8 g of flour. Also present in each vial were 50 adult predators (either c or b). Some of the populations received pupae of one species; some, pupae of the other species. The remainder-our primary concern- received both species (see Table 6). We first ask an obvious question which has an obvious answer. What is the gross relation between initial numbers and total survival on a per-vial basis? Assume that we ignore the effects of species of prey and proportions of prey. Assume further that we include the "control populations" in the averaging, that is, those sets characterized by only one species of pupa. This procedure leads to the tabulation shown in Table 11. From that tabulation, we conclude that, as the total number of pupae increases, more pupae survive to adulthood but, also, more pupae are eaten. The finding is equally true for both species of adult predators. We now ask a more entertaining ques- tion. Is there a relation, displayed by the two-prey cultures, between initial num- TABLE 10 ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE OF THE NUMBERS-OF-PUPAE AND PROPORTIONS-OF-PUPAE DATA Predators and Source df Mean Square F P of Variation Tribolium confusum adults (b-I): Numbers of pupae............ 2 1,419 5.27 &lt;.025 Proportions of pupae.......... 2 177 0.66 &gt;.10 Interaction ................. 4 476 1.77 &gt;.10 Residual ................... 36 270 Tribolium rastaneum adults (c-IV-a): Numbers of pupae............ 2 3,656 45.52 &lt;.0001 Proportions of pupae.......... 2 488 6.08 &lt;.01 Interaction ................. 4 69.3 0.86 &gt;.10 Residual .................... 36 80.3</page><page sequence="18">CANNIBALISM OF PUPAE 245 ber of pupae and their subsequent escape from cannibalism if the matter is ex- amined on a per-pupa basis? Such a rela- tion does indeed exist (Table 10), and momentarily we will clarify it. The effect on differential survival, in the statistical sense, is modest (P &lt; .025) when T. confusum is the predator and convincing (P &lt; .0001) when T. castaneum is the predator. As we develop this story, it is helpful to remember our two prior con- clusions: (1) that c adults are consistent- ly more voracious than b adults and (2) that c adults consume relatively more pupae of b, while b adults consume rela- tively more pupae of c. These conclusions are not clouded when attention centers on the effect of pupal numbers per se. Rather, and as would be expected, the conclusions are corroborated. To clarify the relation between initial numbers and percentage survival, we re- arrange some of the data of Table 6. This is shown in Table 12. There, three groups of entries comprise the nine rows. The first group compares, on a relative basis, the survival of 50 with 100 with 200 pupae when all of them had been intro- duced in the proportion 3 c:l b. The second group does the same thing, except that the initial proportion is 1 c:1 b. The third group is concerned with the propor- tion 1 c:3 b. Two items appear in each cell of Table 12: the percentage figure which pertains to that treatment and the rank (in parentheses) of this figure when taken as a member of its set of three. A rank of 1 means that survival from adult predation is maximal or, conversely, that the rate of cannibalism is minimal. The data of Table 12, supported by Table 6, lead to the following generaliza- tion: The lower the initial number of TABLE 11 Initial Species Mean Mean Mean No. of of Adult No. of No. of Perent- Pupae Predator Survivors Pupae age of Eaten Survivors 50.... b 21 29 42 100.... b 52 48 52 200.... b 130 70 65 50.... c 4 46 8 100.... c 19 81 19 200....

This holds true irrespective of which species of adult is the predator, irrespective of which species of pupa is the prey, and ir- respective of the initial proportions of b to c pupae. In other words, taking 1 to signify greatest relative survival, the characteristic rank order with increase in relation between proportion and sur- vival. This appears in Table 13.

Of the 12 sets of rankings there are three exceptions, all of which, oddly enough, involve the pupae of T. confusum. The only excep- tion that does not seem trivial is the sur- vival of b pupae in the 3: 1 proportion when b was the predator, that is, the in- version of 67% and 580/0. Although we have no explanation of this particular discrepancy, we are convinced that the phenomenon just described does enjoy a general validity. The data of Table 6 are again rear- ranged in order to examine the possible hand columns report cannibalism by the 50 T. castaneum adults. The findings differ substantially, de- pending upon which species of beetle is the predator. When T. confusum is the predator, there is no consistent relation between proportion and survival-a point equally true for both b and c pupae. Let us glance down the two columns in the central com- partment of Table 13 (% c and % b sur- vival). If these percentages are ranked for each of the three initial pupal densi- ties, no obvious correlation can be seen</page><page sequence="20">CANNIBALISM OF PUPAE 247 between these ranks and the porportion component of treatment. For example, survival of c pupae is maximal, first, in the 3:1 ratio, then in 1:3, then in 1:1, while survival of b pupae is maximal in the 1:1, 3:1, and 1:1 ratios. The same capriciousness, supported by the analysis of variance, occurs for differential sur- vival. Table 10 clearly affirms that no significance should be attributed to the item "proportions of pupae" (P &gt; .10). It would thus appear that, as T. con- fusum forages in the flour, it is quite in- different to the abundance of one species of prey relative to the abundance of the other species despite its demonstrated "preference" for c (over b) pupae and despite the fact that it consumes pupae at a higher rate when fewer pupae are available. On the other hand, when T. castaneum is the predator, there is a suggestion of a consistent relation between proportion and survival (Table 13). In all cases, the survival of both b pupae and c pupae was greatest when these stages had been in- troduced in the ratio 1:1. This was true for all three initial densities of prey. Also, when T. castaneum adults cannibal- ized their own pupae, they consumed relatively more of them in the 1 c:3 b treatments than in the 3 c:1 b treat- ments. When the same beetles consumed T. confusum pupae, the survival of the latter was so slight that comparison of proportions has little apparent meaning. In fact, none of the differences appear very great, but, even so, they do achieve statistical significance (P &lt; .01), as shown by the appropriate entry in Table 10. A situation -a Gestalt, per- haps-thus seems to exist among these populations that stimulates, or at least permits, the predator to react in relation to the proportion of prey it encounters. A final point, a dividend of more than perfunctory interest, emerges from Table 13. In the fifth and eighth columns of this table note that we have included the differences (% b - 0o c and % c - 0% b). The first pertains to predation by T. confusum; the second, to predation by T. castaneum. To illustrate the meaning of such a difference, consider, say, the entry "31" appearing in the second row. That says that, as an average of five replicates, 31% more b pupae than c pu- pae survived cannibalism by 50 adult T. confusum when 25 pupae of b and 25 pupae of c were initially present. An intriguing, and quite unexpected, paradox comes to light if we examine, as is shown in Table 13, the averages of the averages. When T. confusum is the preda- tor, these figures decrease with increase in initial pupal numbers: 2370 to 167% to 4% (survival of b favored). For T. castaneum, however, the order is exactly reversed: 9% to 22% to 40% (survival of c favored). Before contemplating these apparent trends, it is necessary to ask whether they are real or fanciful; for example, whether 23 differs significantly from 16 or 4, and so on. To answer this question, we first computed (% b - % c) for the 45 populations in which T. confusum was the cannibal and (% c - %o b) for the 45 populations in which T. castaneum was the cannibal. This yielded a set of 15 percentages for each initial pupal density (50, 100, 200). The three densities were then compared as couplets (separately by species of predator, of course) by using the non-parametric ranking test proposed by Wilcoxon (Wal- lis and Roberts, 1956). The results of this are as follows: P (Two-tailed) T. confusum, the predator: 50owith 100 ................. .3174 50 with 200 ................. &lt;.0020 100 with 200 ............... &lt;..0020 T. castaneum, the predator: 50 with 100. ................ ..0048 50 with 200 ................. &lt;.0020 100 with 200 ................. &lt;.0020</page><page sequence="21">248 THOMAS PARK, D. B. MERTZ, AND M. NATHANSON With one exception, the above proba- bility values support the trend-a trend which appears to be valid rather than coincidental. The underlying phenome- non, which is on display in Table 13, is this: That b beetles become less and less species selective in their cannibalistic habits as the total number of prey in- creases, while, conversely, c beetles be- come more and more species selective. We have already noted that the mean percentage of survivors for both species of prey increases as the total number of pupae increases. We now note that the order of magnitude of this change ap- pears to be greater for c than for b pupae. This is the case whether c or b is the predator. However, when c is the preda- tor, this phenomenon widens the margin of differential survivorship, while, when b is the predator, the margin is narrowed. When c is the predator, the cannibalism (percentage dead pupae) on c pupae falls (or, equally true, the survivorship rises) by almost 40% as prey density increases, while that for b pupae decreases by less than 9%. When b is the predator, the corresponding figures are 34% and 14%. Differently stated, compared with c, a b pupa has a much better chance of es- caping cannibalism by b adults if it is a member of a mixed-species cohort con- sisting of 50, rather than 200, pupae. Contrariwise, compared with b, the probability of survival of c pupae from cannibalism by c adults becomes greater as the cohorts enlarge from 50 to 100 to 200 individuals. This phenomenon is also verified by the entries in Table 9, which show that selectivity changes with prey density, but away from the preferred prey in b and toward it in c. SUMMARY 1. Voracity of predators (reconfirmation of earlier findings) .-Tribolium castaneum is characteristically more predaceous than T. confusum. 2. Choice of prey (reconfirmation of earlier findings).-Adults of T. confusum consume more pupae and callows of T. castaneum than of T. confusum. Contrari- wise, adults of T. castaneum consume, to an even greater degree, more pupae and callows of T. confusum than of T. casta- neum. 3. Number of prey (reconfirmation of a finding by Mertz and Davies [1968]).-The greater the number of pupae initially introduced into the habitat, the greater the number of pupae that survive canni- balism, but, also, the greater the number of pupae that are eaten. However, surviv- al of prey on a percentage basis is lowest when the initial number of pupae is small, and it improves with increase in pupal numbers. Differently stated, the rate of cannibalism per predator per prey is maximized at low prey density and minimized at high prey density. 4. Species proportion of prey (new finding).-When T. confusum is the predator, there is no discernible relation between initial species proportion of pupae and their subsequent escape from cannibalism. However, when T. casta- neum is the predator, survival of both species of prey is greatest when they are introduced in a 1:1, rather than in a 3:1 or a 1:3, proportion. 5. Predator selectivity of prey in relation to prey density (new finding).-When T. confusum (b) is the predator, compared with c, a b pupa has a relatively better chance of surviving predation when it is a member of a small, rather than a large, mixed-species cohort of pupae. However, when T. castaneum (c) is the predator, compared with b, a c pupa has a relative- ly better chance of surviving predation when it is a member of a large, rather than a small, mixed-species cohort of pupae.</page><page sequence="22">CANNIBALISM OF PUPAE 249 DISCUSSION We now reflect about our results in more general terms, paying particular at- tention to their possible relation to the performance of "true" populations. Two studies have been reported, each con- cerned with the cannibalism of pupae by adult beetles. Among other things, the experiments differed in the distribution of the prey in their columns of flour. In one case, the pupae were positioned by prior movements of larvae. In the other case, the positioning was created by us. In the latter experiment (pupal distribu- tion) we discovered that vertical disper- sion of pupae is indeed related to sur- vival, and we reaffirmed that the pat- tern of selectivity previously established (Park et al., 1965) also holds true within each of the three zones containing pupae. However, we actually know very little about the "natural distribution" of pu- pae in reproducing populations, and thus it is difficult to apply directly the new findings (namely, the demonstrated "bot- tom hunting" behavior of Tribolium castaneum and the "top-feeding" be- havior of T. confusum) to the various competition studies. But, since it is now quite evident that the survival of pupae (from adult predation) is correlated with their locus in the flour, it becomes clear that pupal distribution is a functional component of the Tribolium ecosystem, regardless of whether one is concerned with intraspecies or interspecies com- petition. One interesting lead for further experimentation, however, does emerge from the pupal-distribution experiment. It is the suggestion that the two species of predators, when living together in the same vial, appear to exploit their habitat somewhat more thoroughly than does either species when living alone. In the pupal-proportion experiment, neither the pattern of pupal distribution, nor the relation of this pattern to sur- vival, is known. But, as argued previous- ly, the large larvae probably manufac- ture a pupal dispersion similar to that found in continuously breeding popula- tions. Assuming this to be true, we feel more comfortable in using the data of the second experiment to interpret cer- tain events that occur in competition. However, the various findings derived from the pupal-proportion experiment have exposed us (and perhaps the patient reader!) to a kaleidoscopic, even be- wildering, array of percentages. To clari- fy this somewhat, we have extracted an example from the results presented ear- lier in order to suggest what these shifts in percentages could mean in terms of total, and differential, survival of T. confusum and T. castaneum prey. Let us concentrate on differential spe- cies survival as this varies with the initial numbers of prey offered to the adult predators. We return to Table 6, but now, to simplify matters, we limit our attention only to the proportion 1 b:1 c. In Table 14 both the numbers surviving and the percentages are given, and the differences, either (c - b) or (b - c), are shown in parentheses. The upper part of the table concerns predation by T. con- fusum adults; the lower part, by T. castaneum adults. Consider the data when b is the predator. While the differ- ences between the number of b and the number of c survivors do not change with treatment, the percentage differences change appreciably. Besides the survival percentages, it is helpful to look at the ratio (calculated from the exact figures in Table 6) of b survival to c survival, which takes the value 2.1 for 50 pupae and 1.1 for 200 pupae. Thus, with respect to competition, we would postulate that more advantage would accrue to T. con- fusum (b-I) when total pupal production is low than when it is high.</page><page sequence="23">250 THOMAS PARK, D. B. MERTZ, AND M. NATHANSON When c is the predator, differential survival, both numerical and proportion- al, increases with initial pupal density. The ratio of c to b survivors, however, remains essentially the same (5.0 for the initial 50 and 4.1 for the initial 200 pu- pae). Obviously, to the extent that sheer number affords a competitive advantage, T. castaneum (c-IV-a) would be more favored in pupal cohorts of 200 than in cohorts of 50. But as far as the relative number of b and c affects competitive outcome, all three initial cohort sizes are similar for c. variability in numbers as well as in re- spect of averaged standing crops. Tri- bolium confusum b-I exhibits an out- break-crash pattern of population be- havior; hence, its census numbers are unusually variable through time. On the other hand, T. castaneum c-IV-a is given to outbreaks in adult numbers but avoids crashes. Following an outbreak, c-IV-a populations diminish slowly, with little apparent evidence of density-dependent adult mortality, and, barring another outbreak, they return to normal-sized populations after about a generation of TABLE 14 No. OF SURVIVORS PFRCENTAGE OF SURVIVORS INITIAL NO.

Our studies of the ecology of this system have led in many directions and have be- come a central theme of much of the work done in this laboratory. We have noted elsewhere that b-I builds extremely dense populations as single-species cul- tures while c-IV-a is characterized by low numbers of all life-history stages. Yet, paradoxically, c-IV-a has a higher intrinsic rate of increase than does b-I: 0.640 as opposed to 0.522 per head per 5 days. The relations between voracity and population size, though superficially ob- vious, merit further explication. It should be recalled that the differences between the two species strains, considered as populations, show up both in respect of low recruitment rates. The immature population of c-IV-a is cyclic-a dramat- ic predator-prey cycle imposed on the population by the eating of eggs by larvae. In consequence, the pupae tend to enter the population in regularly spaced waves, and population outbreaks are often preceded by exceptionally large cohorts of pupae. In competition, b-I and c-IV-a gener- ate census histories which fulfil the theo- retical conditions of the "unstable sta- tionary state" in the sense that some- times b-I survives and sometimes c-IV-a. Often T. confusum and T. castaneum in- crease simultaneously, then decline to- gether, then increase, and so on through time. This creates an impression of co- existence (the "stable stationary state").</page><page sequence="24">CANNIBALISM OF PUPAE 251 But the impression is illusory because, if the populations are studied long enough (in one case nearly 5 years!), either one or the other species is invariably the winner. Actually, for our conditions of experiment, T. castaneum (c-IV) is the "superior" competitor-superior in that it chalks up a victory record of 90% (Park et al., 1964). Regardless of whether attention cen- ters on intraspecies or interspecies com- petition, the eating of pupae and callows by mature beetles is on all counts a significant regulatory component of the system. The pupae are the last stages vulnerable to cannibalism. If they escape this fate, they quickly enter the popula- tion as sclerotized adults. In a certain sense these adults are more or less im- mune to the "pressures" of competition, and, demographically speaking, they are destined to enjoy a life both fecund and long. In single-species cultures, the con- sumption of pupae is the final check on adult numbers; in mixed-species cultures, it is this and more. Any differential pre- dation (of the sort reported earlier) di- rected against one or the other species of pupae could play a decisive role in determining the competitive outcome. It is thus inescapable that as we learn more about cannibalistic predation we realize increasingly how vital it is in understanding the ecology of Tribolium. Indeed, some workers seem to regard their experiments with flour beetles as being essentially investigations of preda- tor-prey interactions (Sokoloff and Ler- ner, 1967). Let us pursue this matter. Strain c-IV-a maintains smaller popu- lations than b-I primarily because it is more voracious. In other words, the greater potential of c-IV-a to saturate its environment is held in check, counter- balanced if you wish, by its proficiency as a cannibal. The predatory differences between these two species strains are not limited to the eating of pupae by adults. Tribolium castaneumn is also more vora- cious when eggs are the prey and either larvae or adults are the predators (Park et al., 1965). Furthermore, and again because of c-IV-a's gluttony, a mixed- species population, as now would be predicted, generates census histories far more similar to those of c-IV-a than of b-I. It seems quite clear that the competi- tive advantage of c-IV-a over b-I lies in a strategic combination of factors: c-IV- a's higher intrinsic rate of increase, its faster rate of development from egg to adult, its greater predaceousness, and, most certainly, its strong preference for for b-I pupae. Indeed, it is surprising that b-I ever wins a competitive en- counter when the two species are started in a 1:1 proportion. We suspect that when this happens, as it does on rare occasions, b-I (for some unknown reason) gains an early numerical advantage over its opponent. This suspicion receives some support in the recent work of Leslie et al. (1968). There it was shown that b-I could be "made" to win over c-IV-a if the parental adults were intro- duced in numbers of 64 b:4 c and 64 b: 8 c. In such cases, the preferential can- nibalism of T. confusum adults for T. castaneum pupae could be the process that confers on b-I the initial advantage and thereby determines the final out- come. Thus, from our short-term and simplified studies of cannibalism, we find a likely, though partial, explanation of why the b-I/c-IV-a system conforms to the "unstable stationary state." The reader will find this matter elaborated, both empirically and mathematically, in the publication cited above. The relation of pupal numbers to the intensity of cannibalistic predation was discussed comprehensively by Mertz and Davies (1968). They constructed a sto-</page><page sequence="25">252 THOMAS PARK, D. B. MERTZ, AND M. NATHANSON chastic model showing that c-IV-a adults behave as if their appetite for pupae were satiable, although they did not claim that such satiation is the actual biological mechanism. This assumption accounts for the reduced rate of can- nibalism per predator per prey when pupal numbers are relatively large. Mertz and Davies also showed that the popula- tion outbreaks exhibited by c-IV-a and by b-I would be improbable if the preda- tors behaved as if they were unsatiable. In short, the Mertz-Davies model pre- dicts that "satiation," when coupled with rather high variability in pupal production, should lead to occasional population outbreaks. We indulge, for a moment, in the luxury of anthropomorphism. Our data show that c-IV-a is more selective as a predator when its prey is abundant. This conforms to our own experience-- we, too, are finicky when comestibles are plentiful. It is tempting to generalize-to assume a parallel between the prandial habits of c-IV-a and ourselves, or con- trariwise. But our data also show that b-I, by being less selective when the prey is abundant, behaves in exactly the op- posite way! This, unfortunately, demol- ishes our anthropomorphism, but, fortu- nately, it spares us the necessity of ra- tionalizing a generality which is not a generality at all. In conclusion, it seems appropriate to place the research reported in this paper in perspective with the general program of this laboratory. Although flour beetles are the experimental material, our major objective is not to study these insects for their own sake-to erect an "indoor ecology"-but, rather, to make use of them in the analysis of certain ecological phenomena. These phenomena are intra- species and interspecies competition. By means of extensive, and extended, census observations of single-species and mixed- species populations, we are able to de- scribe the competition, that is, to demon- strate quantitatively how the popula- tions behave as they pass through con- tinuous generation time. But this is a description, not an explanation. Along with this we measure the "primary char- acteristics" of the two species: basically, those data required to estimate the rele- vant intrinsic rates of increase. This, though a step forward, is again not an explanation, because, above all else, a Tribolium population must be viewed as a cannibalistic orgy-but one with a pattern. Cannibalism thus confounds "competition" (as traditionally viewed) with "predation" and obligates us to study the latter process as well. Finally, we acquire an array of information: phe- nomenological or populational; primary; and predatory. The information can be fitted together in such a way as to achieve a partial, but plausible, interpretation of the major events that regulate the b-I, c-IV-a, and b-I/c-IV-a systems. But much remains to be done, and Tribolium has a way of often surprising us. Once we remarked: "The longer we study flour beetles, the less we view them as beads in an urn." This statement gains cogency with each new investigation. It is a state- ment, however, not of despair, but of excitement. The reassuring aspect is that, thus far at least, each new problem pre- sented to us by the beetles has proved to be testable. SUMMARY This paper reports data dealing with the consumption of pupae and callows by adult flour beetles. Two strains of two species were used as prey and as preda- tors: Tribolium confusum ("b-I") and T. castaneum ("c-IV-a"). In one experiment the initial spatial distribution of the pupae was varied by design. In the other</page><page sequence="26">CANNIBALISM OF PUPAE 253 experiment the initial numbers and the species proportions of pupae were varied by design. The number of predators was constant throughout. It is shown that all components of treatment affected the pattern of cannibalism or, as we prefer to view it, the survival of the prey. The findings are discussed in relation to the larger ecological problem, namely, the part played by intraspecies and inter- species predation in regulating the out- come of competition.
