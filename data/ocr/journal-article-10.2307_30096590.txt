THE prehistoric site of Thermi lies io km. north of Mytilene, nearly 2 km. east of the modern village, and about half a kilometre south-east of the hot springs which give the district its name. Before excavation it appeared as a low mound on the coast, part of which had been cut away by the sea. The cliff face rises to 6-20 m. at the highest part of the mound: the relation of virgin soil to the settlement earth is shewn in the sections, B</page><page sequence="2">2 W. LAMB P1. II. Scattered stones, obviously once used for building, extend for 30 m. out to sea : it seems probable that at least 15-20 m. of the city have been lost on this side owing to the gradual erosion of the coast. The extent of the surviving parts can be roughly estimated from the map, P1. I, though not all the boundaries have yet been discovered. Excavations were begun in 1929, continued in 1930, and are still far from completion. Both years' work is reported in the following paper, which must, however, be regarded as a preliminary and incomplete publication, subject to correction and revision. General Conclusions. It is convenient at this stage to anticipate our conclusions, the grounds for which will be given under various headings. The site on the coast seems to have been inhabited continuously from the early bronze age to a period contemporary with Troy IIa : say from 3400 to 2000 B.C. or later. Architecturally, we can distinguish five main superposed settlements; ceramically, three periods; towns and periods are related roughly as follows :- First Town First Ceramic Period (related to Troy I). Second Town7 Third Town Second Ceramic Period.' Fourth Town Third Ceramic Period (related to Troy II). Fifth Town The plans in Figs. I and 3, if superposed, would shew that the first town extends further northward and westward than the fifth: various points suggest that it did not reach so far south, but this requires investi- gation. In any case, it appears considerably larger. The area round about the south-west test pits, hereafter referred to as the south-west area, has produced an alien type of pottery including elements suggestive of Troy VI, which will be discussed in next year's report. This pottery has also been found on the late street which crosses the end of the area I and above the semi-apsidal houses in I next the street (see plan). When using the terms ' site ' or ' settlement,' the south- west area is excluded. 1 Actually, the second period began a little before the end of the second town. In the report for 1929 in J.H.S. xlix. p. 223, the periods, instead of being called first, second and third, are called first, intermediate and second.</page><page sequence="3">EXCAVATIONS AT THERMI. 3 Method of Excavation. The ideal way of excavating such a site would be to uncover the whole of each of the superposed settlements one by one. This was rendered impossible on the northern half by the proprietor, who made the most of the privileges recently granted to owners of ancient sites, and would not allow the excavated ground to remain uncovered from year to year. It was, therefore, necessary to mark off certain areas which could be cleared to virgin soil within the season, and then refilled. A glance at the map will shew that, in the uppermost two Towns, the houses were grouped into blocks, divided from each other by streets. The most practical course was to let our own divisions (lettered A-I, see Figs. 1-3) coincide more or less with the blocks in question. Since the lower towns are differently oriented, these divisions run diagonally across house groups in Towns I, II and III; in consequence, plans of some of the low-level houses are still incomplete, and must remain so until next season. Equally incomplete is the area of Town V between Z and 1. The proprietors of the southern half of the site have given us every facility: the uppermost town, with the exception of a small part beyond the modern dyke on the extreme south, has been cleared and remains open, ready for work to recommence. It is proposed to excavate most of the site to virgin soil, but to leave unexcavated samples representative of all five towns in case anyone should, at some future date, wish to check our conclusions. Stratification : Periods of Occupation. The stratification is best explained by the sections on P1. II. The buildings are the most solid guide to the different stages of occupation, in spite of the fact that their lowest courses are laid irregularly and their topmost surviving courses irregularly preserved : in spite, too, of the way in which houses were reconstructed and re-used. Floor levels, constantly renewed, are too numerous to mark any main division of period except in rare instances. The pottery, gradually developing from the red and black wares of the first period to the brown and grey wares of the second, supplements what we learn from the architecture. Where the ground slopes downward to the north-west, the walls of the buildings run downhill with it. This is particularly noticeable in B2</page><page sequence="4">4 W. LAMB F. On the outlying parts of F the pottery and other antiquities were, as one would expect, slightly contaminated. Where the ground slopes downward to the south, we are at present unable to say in what relation the buildings in E stood to those in e, owing to the fact that the end walls of E have been destroyed.' In I, it looks as if the buildings followed the slope as in F. Moreover, additional proof that the buildings just beneath the surface in H belong to the same period as those in Z is given by the almost identical style of construction. and the buildings in the top layer of A, B, A, E, are obviously con- temporary with those in the top layer of Z. Still more conclusive, the pottery from the surface half-metre of e and H is of the same kind as that from the surface half-metre of A-Z. Staff: Acknowledgments. The workmen numbered from 25-30 in 1929; in 1930 from 60 to 80. Of the latter, however, only one-fifth were pickmen. The economic situation was complicated in 1930 by the unemployment of the olive workers: as practically everyone in this part of the island lives by tending olives, the villagers were literally starving. Contributions to enable us to employ extra men were received from various sources, in particular from members of the Anglo-Hellenic League. We are, more- over, deeply indebted to the Worts fund for its generous and welcome support. To all these our warmest thanks are due, while the men and their families have begged me to convey theirs. I should like especially to thank Professor Desch for the report on the metal objects, which he has allowed me to publish on p. 39. With- out his kindness in undertaking the analyses, the results of the excavation would have lost much of their value. I am, moreover, under a great obligation to Professor Ktenas and Dr. Kokkoros of the University of Athens for the identification of the material of the stone implements, and to Professor Ktenas for the note on imports which appears on p. 46. In 1929 the party consisted of myself, assisted by Mr. Hutchinson and Miss Haspels, of the University of Amsterdam; also, for a shorter time, by Mr. Tait, Miss Burne and Miss Horner. In 1930, Miss Nine Six was 1 No section of this part of the area is worth giving till it has been cleared to virgin soil.</page><page sequence="5">EXCAVATIONS AT THERMI. 5 with me throughout the excavation; Mr. Hutchinson, Miss Haspels, Mr. Burton Brown, Mr. Cullen and Mr. Wason for shorter periods. Mr. Burton Brown was in charge of area F, Miss Haspels of area E, and I am indebted to them for most of the photographs of the site. Mr. Hutchinson was in charge of area Z and made a special study of the pottery. Miss Six looked after and indexed the finds. Mr. Wason conducted part of the excavation of e. The plans are by myself, with the exception of Nos. 1-4 of the area F which are by Mr. Burton Brown.

Consul for Mytilene : also to the facilities given to us by the proprietors of the southern half of the site, Messrs. Basileiou and Bouioukas, of Mytilene. THE BUILDINGS. First and Second Towns (Fig. I).-The chief building material appears to have been stone, of three kinds : (I) schist, used in long slabs; (2) small chunks of inferior local marble; (3) a volcanic stone, very light, soft and</page><page sequence="6">6 W. LAMB decomposed.' The softness made it easy to dress, and in Towns I and II it was often dressed carefully and used in large blocks. It is still quarried in two places, one a few minutes' walk south of the site, the other inland behind the new school. Schist occurs everywhere on the two hills that run parallel with the coast. Typical first and second town walls are illustrated in plates and text. Notice in Fig. 2 the juxtaposition of large and small blocks (from west wall of A. I. I); in P1. IV, 3 the large size of the stones (from A. I. I, south wall of small ante-room, adjoining E. I. I and 2); and in P1. IV, 4 (from wall between A. 1. I, and E. I. 2) the herring-bone arrangement. The latter occurs occasionally in our low settlements, and DADO EARTH VIRGIN SOIL A SECTION AT A B. B o 1 M. FIG. 2.-DETAIL OF WALLS. is characteristic of the first city of Troy.2 Earth was rammed in the interstices of the stones : occasionally a wall would be found with a core of earth only between stone facings. It is not yet certain whether mud-brick 3 was used in the first and second cities : in the third to fifth it was employed, though more sparingly than at Troy. Some of the stone walls of the first and second cities are preserved to a considerable height, e.g. 1-65 m. This suggests that stone was used throughout, which is natural, since it is easy to procure and to work. 1 See Philippson, Reisen und Forschungen I. geological map. 2 Troja und Ilion, p. 47, Fig. 9. It is also found in the new Early Helladic settlement at Hagios Kosmas in Attica: I am indebted to Dr. Mylonas for this information. 3 Compare Troja und Ilion, i. p. 36, where it is associated with Troy II (i.e. our Towns IV, V) but not with Troy I.</page><page sequence="7">EXCAVATIONS AT THERMI. 7 Roofing is almost always a matter on which one cannot safely theorise. In the long, narrow rooms which occur at all periods, we looked for any traces of post holes or pillar supports. The only post hole found was in a gap in a wall, therefore irrelevant to the present question (Z, north corner) : a possible pillar support in the form of a shallow round block was discovered at a level of 3"OI m., 1 not in situ, in the east corner of A. I. The procuring of timber suitable for roofing must have been com- paratively easy, if the island was as well provided with trees in the early bronze age as it was Ioo years ago : oak and cedar are still to be found. In any case, it seems certain that the roofs would have been flat, as at Troy.2 Door sockets, more or less square, mark the position of many of the doors. The map will shew that these sockets are found both incorporated with the wall (B. I. I) and outside it (F. I. 4). Sometimes the threshold was paved by a long piece of schist (F. I. 4). It was not uncommon to find door sockets, reversed, used as ordinary building material. The doors appear to have been in the narrow end of the buildings.3 Floors were made of sand and small pebbles collected from the sea- shore. These were usually sprinkled thinly and have frequently been altogether swept away, but here and there a thick patch survives. All floors were constantly raised and renewed. Both first and second towns were oriented, roughly, north and south. The remains which can be attributed to the first town are few, since most walls were pulled down when the second town was erected. Those that still stand are, however, often distinctive owing to the superior quality of their construction, for they are composed of larger and more uniform stones than their successors. With regard to particular buildings: most houses, as has already been pointed out, are long and narrow, but a broader type of room, like that found in other Greek islands, does occur in the low levels, e.g. in Z. It does not, apparently, exist in the later periods. The end of house 3 in F. I. is curved slightly, but not enough, in view of the interrupted 1 Above sea-level. See sections. 2 Troja und Ilion, pp. 40, 41. 3 The threshold in the side of the ante-room of A. I. I, a later modification, is excep- tional. Where the plans shew gaps in the long side walls of a room, it is due to the destruc- tion of the wall itself and not to the presence of a door.</page><page sequence="8">8 W. LAMB wall, for one to be certain whether or not it is a predecessor of the semi- apsidal houses of Towns IV and V. It is also a question whether rooms like F. I. 3 were part of the house F. I. 2 : usually each oblong was, as far as we can judge, a distinct unit unconnected by any door.' In con- trast to the arrangement in Crete, Phylakopi and neolithic Thessaly,2 houses at Thermi tend to have the large living room behind one or more smaller rooms. The street which runs through B and F does not belong to the first city, but to its successor. Where the street runs out towards the sea in F, passing above the destroyed walls of house F. I. 2, its construction can be made out with gratifying distinctness: the paving is of pebbles and cobbles and a few large blocks; a border of slightly dressed stones emphasises the bend (P1. V, 4). Within the rooms are certain non-structural remains that deserve attention. In many corners, we found shelves, seats or small platforms, which were made of stones and cobbles carefully laid and sometimes edged by longer stones. The examples in Towns I and II are naturally less well preserved than those in Towns IV and V. Isolated platforms, composed of slabs of schist supported on parallel rows of stones (see Pl. V, 5) occurred in A and F; the parallel supporting stones, despoiled of their covering slabs, in E and Z. The purpose of these platforms is uncertain, since no traces of ash or bones and no vases or other objects were associated with them. A platform in Z, differently constructed from those described above, may have some religious significance. It was oblong in shape, and com- posed of two courses of medium-sized blocks, with a patch of earth in the middle. Here stood a jar, containing nothing but soil: the top had been broken off in ancient times, but the lower part was perfectly pre- served. Many rooms in Town I were store-rooms : this is proved by the pre- sence of long rows of holes for pithoi which can be detected in virgin soil : as several holes contained the lower halves of actual pithoi, the pur- pose of the rest is obvious (Pl. III, 5, from F. I. 4). No doubt the later towns were similarly equipped. Third Town.-This phase of the Thermi settlement is so fragmentary and disjointed that one hesitates whether to call it a town. There is, 1 See note, p. 7. 2 Fimmen, Kretisch-Mykenische Kultur, p. 45.</page><page sequence="9">EXCAVATIONS AT THERMI. 9 however, no doubt that certain walls representing more than one stage of occupation can be connected neither with Town II nor with the town which I have called IV. Moreover, to the same period belong two interesting phenomena : the clay-lined pits described below and the burnt clay areas in Z. We will begin with the walls. These, as has been indicated, are for the most part too ruined to form house plans. The most arresting wall is in B, a wide structure composed of large stones almost like a causeway. The orientation, in all areas save E, is the same as that of the lower towns. In E, however, there is a notable development: a group of houses was built running diagonally to those of Towns I and II; and the outlines of these houses were kept, with small alterations, for all subsequent build- ings in this district. In particular, the lines of the walls running N.-W. to S.-E. were retained, though later walls were often built slightly to one side rather than on top. In B, masses of fallen stones, evidently the debris of walls, cover most of the ground at a level of ca. 4-75 m., and form a foundation for later buildings. Amongst this debris below the east wall of B. III. were found fragments of human bones and of two skulls inserted between and possibly crushed by the stones. The Clay Pits.-There are twenty-one of these altogether: sixteen of them lie between levels 4-65 and 4-00 m.i : two are at about 4-80 m. : three are below 4 m. Of these, one in E, with its rim at a depth of 3.67 m., may belong to Town II. That the pits should, with one possible exception, be confined to a particular stratum complicates our theories as to their purpose. They are either round or oval, sometimes narrowing towards the base. The material is stiff, blue-green clay with walls from 2*5 to 4 cm. thick, depth varying from -74 m. to -09 m.,2 diameter of top varying from 1"43 m. to -51 m. A number of them are protected by a surrounding wall; some lie in areas paved with fallen stones; others are isolated. Their contents include potsherds; often ash; occasionally stones; in two cases, layers of pebbles; rarely, animal bones. Nor are objects of value wholly absent; one pit produced a figurine, another a lead ring. Slag, a fragment of rock-crystal, and a net-weight are less surprising. 1 The levels given are those of the rims. 2 The shallow bothroi, however, appeared to have been cut short in ancient times by later floors.</page><page sequence="10">IO W. LAMB Two interesting but somewhat exceptional pits deserve mention, since the evidence provided by the one is contradicted by the other. The first was in B: it was of the type surrounded by a wall, but only the floor of the actual pit was preserved. The clay was covered in part with pebbles, and in one place the pebbles ran under the wall (of which the foundations, as usual, did not descend as far as the floor of the pit). This suggests that the pebbles were an outlet for straining water. The other pit was in F. It was one of the largest: width I m., length *90 m., depth "53 m. In the lower half was a deposit, about *o06 m. thick, of red earth, burnt but powdery. Below this stood a bowl with legs and rim chipped, apparently in antiquity, and a deer's antler laid across it. Under the bowl was the lead ring mentioned above. This rested on a pebble floor which lined the clay (see P1. VI). The pits at Thermi are obviously similar to the bothroi in the Early Helladic stratum at Orchomenos,' though there the clay is yellow and ashes play a larger part than at Thermi. Other bothroi have been found in an Early Helladic context at Zigourids, Kornikou, Gonia and Eutresis.2 Now the pottery associated with the pits at Thermi is of the second style, scarcely beginning to shew those features which the pottery of our third period has in common with Early Helladic wares. One is tempted to infer that Thermi III was a little earlier than, rather than contemporary with, the phases of Orchomenos, Eutresis and the Peloponnesian sites which produced bothroi. Unfortunately, the function of these bothroi remains obscure. Those at Orchomenos were conjectured to be for the preservation of ashes in connection with some religious belief;3 or alternatively as a kind of oven for the slow cooking of food buried in ashes.4 Neither explanation entirely fits the examples at Thermi, where ashes are not invariably found and where other types of oven prevail: the occasional absence of ashes may, however, be due to cleaning or accident. If the pits were rubbish-pits, one would expect them to contain more animal bones. 1 Bulle, Orchomenos, i. pp. 25 ff. 2 Blegen, Zigourids, pp. 26, 28, 76, 77, 215; Kordkou, p. 75; Goldman, Eutresis, pp. 21, 22. 3 Bulle, Orchomenos, i. pp. 30 ff.; Wace and Thompson, Prehistoric Thessaly, p. 195. 4 Wace and Thompson, loc. cit.; Heurtley, B.S.A. xxix. pp. 173-4; Mylonas, NEOhAlOLKI 'Exoroj, pp. 161-4.</page><page sequence="11">EXCAVATIONS AT THERMI. II During the first campaign at Thermi, they were regarded as latrines, owing to the peculiar construction of the pit in B described above: in this case, the ash where present would have acted as an absorbent or disinfectant. But if so, the appearance of the bowl, antler and ring in the pit in F is inappropriate: moreover, why should the Thermiotes when they had discovered a tolerable system of sanitation, abandon it in the later stage of Town IV ? The burnt clay areas are even more inexplicable. At first we thought they were hearths, but they proved to be too extensive, for they covered large portions of the west, north and north-east parts of Z. Occasionally a true hearth was found in the centre of one of these areas, but these wvere too small to have produced red patches so wide and so hard. They could not have been burnt mud-brick houses, for there were no remains of bricks or wooden beams, and their surface was too flat and uniform. A superficial parallel is afforded by the ploschchadki in the black earth region. It should be noted that burnt clay areas have been found so far in Z only, above the 3"49 m. floor level: they appear in the section on P1. II. Fourth Town (Fig. 3).-The walls of Town III appear to have been pulled down intentionally to make a foundation for Town IV : no abrupt change of culture exists to suggest the incursion of a new and hostile people. Nevertheless, Town IV was differently oriented from Towns I-III, except in E, where its direction had been anticipated, and in A, where the west wall had been raised by every successive generation of builders since the first period (see Section A-B). We now have a handsome block of oblong parallel houses running across B and Z. Divided from the B Z block by a street but facing the same way are the meaner houses of E. Here, as has already been indicated, the long walls kept the lines of their predecessors, while numerous cross walls, frequently destroyed and replaced, produced rooms that were both small and short-lived. The F area is only occupied by the ends of the long houses of the B group. In Z, house No. 2 foreshadows the apsidal houses of the fifth town. The 'furnishings ' of this period-little platforms, square or circular partitions in corners-are well preserved. Sometimes but not always the partitions contain hearths. One of the most interesting constructions is in the third room of house B. IV. 2, where two narrow walls running out</page><page sequence="12">12 W. LAMB from the main walls of the room produce an oblong enclosure which protected the trough and basin described on p. 15. In the house B. IV. I is another type of enclosure, formed of narrow slabs of dressed stone upended: within the enclosure was a pithos. No traces of the platforms of slabs laid on parallel rows of stone, so characteristic of Towns I and II, have yet been found in Towns IV and V. Gur .....Gunt1 " EmpN, O .: EVI FIG. 3.-FOURTH AND FIFTH TOWNS: AREAS EXCAVATED 1929--30. In A and A at a level of ca. 5 m. was a very distinct and extensive layer of powdery red earth, burnt and mixed with charred wood: here, no doubt, were brick and timber houses. This theory is supported by the fact that in a certain part of A traces of wooden cross-beams could be detected at regular intervals (I.2zo m.) from each other, similar to those in Troy II.1 Fifth Town.-This town has suffered less from the modern plough 1 Troja und Ilion, pp. 90go, 91, Fig. 29.</page><page sequence="13">EXCAVATIONS AT THERMI. 13 than Towns I-IV had suffered from the builders of the later settlements; but modern warfare has made havoc of the walls in A round the smaller gun-emplacement, and of the floors in E round the larger. Many of the houses of Town V are built on the foundations of earlier houses: this is particularly clear in B and E, when the long walls were heightened, fresh rooms built, and fresh floors laid down. In Z, however, a further development took place: an entirely new block of houses was built at right angles to the old, and divided from B by a street. These houses have particularly fine walls,1 and one of them, Z. V. 2, is notable for the doorway leading from its anteroom to its living room: two enormous blocks of schist form the threshold, while inside, to right and left, are curved walls acting as screens. Notice particularly the 'flue' behind the hearth in the narrow passage-way of Z. V. 3, 4,2 and the pithos-hearth with the burnt matter raked out of it, in Z. V. 5 (P1. IV, 6). The most interesting region, however, lies to the south. Here we have a group of comparatively small houses (H) running fan-wise towards the city wall: concerning these there is considerable difficulty in deciding which rooms were independent units and which were not. Here too is the handsome house in area 0, conspicuous by reason of its great length and its overheated kitchen (P1. III, 6) with two, possibly three, fireplaces dangerously near the door.3 Between this house and the next is a narrow passage with an enclosure at one end. Then comes a semi-apsidal build- ing which appears on the plan to have two boundary walls on the north side; the inner one, however, is at a lower level, and will probably prove to be of an earlier period. The remainder of area 0 is occupied by small oblong spaces, some of which may be houses while others are passages or 'yards.' The buildings in I, also well equipped with hearths, are distinguished by the curious apsidal annexe on the south-east, the beautiful pithos 4 next the hearth marked 5'73 m. (see P1. V, 2) and the circular platform beneath the hearth marked 5"36 m. Schist was used almost exclusively for making the outer wall of the annexe and beyond, 1 The walls of houses 3 and 4 are, unfortunately, much broken. 2 See Plan, P1. I. Another 'flue' was found in the north-west room of B. V. I. It is uncertain whether Z. V. 3 and 4 were separate houses : they are numbered separately for convenience. * One of the hearths is marked with its level 5 m.: the other two adjoin it. The door socket can be distinguished on the plan. " Mr. Forsdyke suggests that the pithos was for hot water, which could be produced by dropping in stones heated from the neighbouring hearth.</page><page sequence="14">I4 R. W. HUTCHINSON about 30 cm. below the present top of the wall, is a line of stones emphasis- ing the curve (see P1. III, 3): The inner wall is composed of volcanic pumice-like material so decomposed that the stones have become welded together. Round the fifth town ran what appears to have been a wall. Only the foundations remain, and these are distinctive: outside are slabs of schist, inside various irregular blocks. Between I and H, an arm of the wall turned inwards, no doubt protecting a gate : the cross wall running at right angles to the arm must have been a narrow inner gate probably supplemented by a main outer gate. Any trace of this hypothetical main gate has, however, been destroyed, together with a patch of the town wall, by a street of cobbles and fragments of bricks or tiles which encroaches on the houses of i. Above this street and among the stones was found pottery of a later date than any wares belonging to the settle- ment; this, together with the pottery from the outlying test pits, will be discussed in next year's report. W. LAMB. HEARTHS. The normal type of hearth was constructed as follows: On the pebble floor of the room was placed a circle or ellipse of fairly large stones. The interstices of the stones were filled up with more pebbles to make a level surface. On this was laid a floor of sherds, usually set with great care (see P1. III, 6, representing a hearth in 6). Above this was another layer of pebbles and a final layer of burnt earth to form the floor of the actual hearth. One or more of these strata might be omitted or redupli- cated, but exceptions to the rule that a layer of pebbles intervenes between each stratum of sherds or stones were rare in 1929-30. An ash dump was frequently found within two or three metres of each hearth and often adjoining it (see P1. III, 6). Besides the simple hearths there were in our settlement a few ovens of a more complicated pattern. Their base was built up in the same way as the ordinary hearth, but they had a final floor of earth baked almost as hard as a pithos andwere, apparently, roofed with a low beehive structure of brick or baked earth. Two or three shew traces of having been heated by flues running under the floor of the oven. As a rule, however, the fire seems to have been lighted inside until the oven was red hot; the fire would then be</page><page sequence="15">EXCAVATIONS AT THERMI. 15 raked out, the food inserted, and the door closed. This was certainly the method used for the hearth in P1. IV, 5, from the third town, described below (pp. 16, 17). There remain to be considered two structures in the house B. IV. 2, north-west room. Both of them superficially resemble low beehive ovens but no ashes were found near them. The lower was perhaps a simple apotheke but the upper was rather more interesting. The burnt clay wall was of double thickness; on the north-east side, divided from it by a line of stones, was a narrow trough; on the north and east sides was a quantity of greenish clay which appeared to be the ordinary earth impregnated with some organic matter. It is, therefore, conceivable that the narrow trough was used in the manner still employed in Iraq for treading olives. P1. V, 3 shews the basin and the stone parapet which protected the whole erection: the section A-B on P1. II (near the left-hand corner) shews the basin resting on its bed of pebbles, but not the layer of sherds which actually lay between pebbles and basin. Less common, and confined, apparently to the upper levels, are pithos-hearths or ovens made from a coarse pot outside which the fire was kindled. The following account includes a description of one typical simple hearth, five different ovens and two pithos-hearths. They are, of course, only a small proportion of those found and examined. Simple Hearth. In Z. IV. 2, at 515 m. Measurements: 1-1I7 m. from north-west to south-east, 0o84 m. from north-east to south-west. The floor was of red earth (.Io m.) : next came pebbles ('03 m.); next, red earth again ('04 m.); then more pebbles ('05 m.); lastly, a stone foundation (ca. zo m.). Ovens. i. In Z. V. 5, at 5"66 m. A small beehive oven which had a wide opening at one side. The edges of this opening were carefully rounded off: the top of the oven was probably closed.

This is the only beehive oven of which the dome was intact. Nine cm. above the floor was a shelf formed by the large sherd of a pithos. West of the oven stretched a baked clay floor on which the fire may have been made and the red-hot embers from it shovelled in to the lower part of the oven. The method of baking is of course only conjectural, but the structure was well preserved and provided a useful guide for the restoration of other ovens. Measurements: length of dome, "65 x "64 m.

The oven was presumably roofed with a beehive dome of burnt clay, but the roof had perished. The heating seems to have been from beneath the oven floor, for here was an open space filled in front with white ash and at the back with a mixture of ash, wood-charcoal and burnt earth. The whole structure measured 1'30 m. from east to west, I.Io m. from north to south. The layers were as follows :- baked clay floor, 'oi m. sherds, 'oi m. pebbles, o'04 m. stones, .o8 m. northern part: ash and burnt earth '03 m. on red brick earth '025 m. southern part: red brick earth '055 m. 4. In the third settlement B, southern corner. This was a beehive oven with a hole in the roof: the flue on one side appears in Fig. 4. The hole in the roof was probably part of the original design, since the flue was too small to have been used as a door: a flat stone may have closed the oven when the food was actually baking. The flue was shut off when we found it by sherds just as were the flues of the neolithic kiln discovered by Dr. Mylonas at Olynthus.'

To a hearth of the simple type was added a coarse pot laid on its side. This pot was partly embedded in the red burnt earth which formed the top layer of the hearth. The fire would be lit on the hearth and the pithos closed up while cooking was in progress (P1. IV, I). /d =Terracotta U =SSone o o 20 30 40 soocM. FIG. 4.-SECTION OF BEEHIVE OVEN. 2. In B. V.

R. W. HUTCHINSON. THE POTTERY. The Early Bronze Age settlement of Thermi was a western extension of the Troadic culture best known to us by its very cosmopolitan metro- polis at Troy, but more accurately represented by other sites such as Yortan in Mysia, Boz Iyuk in Phrygia, Senirdje in Pisidia and the Toumba of Protesilaos on the Dardanelles. The exact limits of this culture are uncertain, but it appears to have comprised all Asia Minor C</page><page sequence="18">I8 R. W. HUTCHINSON AND W. LAMB west of the River Halys and the Taurus Mountains. Among the islands, Lemnos has produced evidence of belonging to the group,1 and we should expect the same from Imbros, Chios and Tenedos. Euboea, Rhodes and the Sporades as a whole seem to be under Cycladic influence, but in Euboea a distinct Trojan element, though of somewhat later date, has been discovered in certain tombs at Manika.2 North of the Dardanelles, we have a Troadic settlement at the Toumba of Protesilaos, but none, so far, in Thrace proper.3 There must, however, have been some form of extension into Mace- donia to account for the Anatolian character of the Early Bronze Age culture there, which appears to have been the result of a fusion between Troadic and local neolithic elements.4 The pottery from Thermi may be divided into three ceramic periods (see p. 2). That from the settlement (as opposed to the south-west area and the south-west street: see p. 2) shews a continuous develop- ment. In other words, forerunners of any fabric are liable to appear in the stratum below that with which it is associated and stragglers in the stratum above. Likewise, a few examples of shapes typical of later periods occur before they were universally adopted. The pottery from the First Ceramic Period consists of three principal classes: (i) a fine black ware, made of well-mixed clay, highly polished, but soft and brittle; (ii) a moderately fine, well-fired red ware, sometimes slightly polished, merging into (iii), a coarse household ware, more or less red, varying greatly, but always containing a large quantity of grit and small stones as dkgraissants. All the vases were handmade, with the exception, probably, of the wide bowls with incurved rims which we believe to have been made in moulds (as was also suggested to us by the local potter, Spiro Tsokalas). The presence of the well-baked red fabric in the lowest stratum disproves the suggestion that the black wares of the first city of Troy were due merely to insufficient firing, and proves that they were caused by a deliberate carbonisation, whether produced by smoking, by the application of wet leaves or by the addition of some 1 Vases in the museum of Mytilene : unpublished. 2 Of the tombs dug by Papavasileiou at Manika, groups I, II, IV, V were Cycladic, but III was definitely Troadic: this does not imply an invasion from the actual city of Troy.

Bowls with a single pierced handle like No. 276 have, so far, only been found below 3 m. and seem to be a product of the first city, not, like the rest, of the first and second cities : they were soon replaced by a more elegant type, No. 336. The coarse red wares are represented chiefly by mugs, tripod cooking-pots 2 and bowls with uncurved rims, also by many of the miniature vases. In a separate category we must place the enormous pithoi with pointed bases and various kinds of rim, which were used for storage, and of which the production requires a high degree of skill. Some of the vases, particularly the black jugs and pyxides, were adorned with a ribbed or fluted decoration (Fig. 5, Nos. 289, 208). This form of ornament seems to have been almost absent from Troy,3 but it is known from other settlements such as Yortan, Pitane and Senirdje.4 Grooved lines, like those on P1. VI, No. 12, recall a fragmentary jug, better paralleled in our second period, from the Toumba of Protesilaos.5 The fine herring-bone patterns, however, like those on No. I, P1. VII, Fig. 6, Nos. 18 and 20, and on countless low-level sherds, have no counter- part on any Troadic sites, and suggest a connection with the Cyclades. The bowls with incurved rims were plain except that the rims often bore a ribbed ornament of slanting lines as in Fig. 5, No. 311,6 or Fig. 6, No. 19. Incised designs also occur: they are particularly though not ex- clusively associated with lids, jugs and one or two varieties of the shallow bowl or saucer.7 Favourite patterns appear in Fig. 5, and Fig. 6, Nos. 7 and 23. Notice particularly the miniature Schnabelkanne, No. 292 1 Frankfort, Studies in Early Pottery, i. pp. 9-II; ii. pp. 63-71 with full references to earlier discussions. 2 Similar cooking pots are known from Boz ftyuk and from the first city of Troy where Schliemann found two examples just above the virgin soil. Both contained human ashes and in the larger were also the bones of a human embryo (Ilios, No. 59, P. 227). 3 We know only of Inv. 2468, Berlin Museum fiir Valkerkunde: thirteen fragments with very coarse fluting. 4 Forsdyke, B.M.

The second type had a notched rim resembling somewhat S.S. iii (unique at Troy): the ornament not only covered the rim but was applied both inside and outside in the form of vertical panels of chevrons, or chains of lozenges with a dot in the centre of each.</page><page sequence="21">EXCAVATIONS AT THERMI. 21 FIG. 6.-POTTERY: FIRST PERIOD.</page><page sequence="22">22 R.

VII, No. 288, which, in stratification as in type, barely escapes belonging to the next period and is illustrated with the second period vases. In the fine red wares, there was a fashion for decorating the handles of jugs with patterns like those shewn in Fig. 6, Nos. lo-16. The first period at Thermi presumably overlaps the first city of Troy but may start earlier, since it closely resembles the lowest stratum of the Toumba of Protesilaos which the excavators considered to be earlier than Troy I. This theory is supported by the fact that the ribbed or fluted ornaments of Thermi I and Protesilaos I were absent from Troy, whereas the vases with designs in white paint and the horned tubular handles, which were confined to the first city of Troy, were at Thermi characteristic of the Second Ceramic period.2 Before the end of the first period, and while the second town was still standing, certain modifications begin to foreshadow the period that was to follow.3 The black gets duller, but at the same time harder, and a number of vases display a heavy mottled red-grey-black fabric. This fabric is characteristic of the Second or Transitional Period : beside it, we find the black wares, now quite dull in tone, which gradually die out and disappear well before the third period; and red vases, both fine and coarse. In the later stages of the second period, brown pottery, polished or slipped, begins to be common, and pots with a fine red polish also occur. Ribbed and fluted ornaments decrease: the fine herring-bone styles (well represented by the pyxis No. I, which must have been preserved as an heirloom) being the first to go. A new type of decoration, however, makes its appearance, consisting of designs in white paint.4 This, though known at Yortan, is very uncommon in the early cities of Iroy. Incised wares continue to flourish (Fig. 6, Nos. 4, 5, 6, 17, 21, 22, 24), and lines are frequently filled with white. The changes in shapes are indicated on Fig. 7. Notice the absence 1 B.S.A. xix. p. 56, Fig. 4. 2 The shape which we call the horned tubular handle is illustrated on Fig. 6, No. 8.

The principal groups were (i) small and moderately fine vases coated outside and, if possible, inside with a highly-polished brown, grey or yellow slip; (ii) coarser vases often unslipped. The large storage pithoi shew new developments in shape and decoration, but space neces- sitates postponing their discussion till next year's report. Incised decoration continues, but was less well executed and much more sparingly used.1 Its most typical form is that of parallel vertical lines on the rims of bowls (Fig. 6, No. 2). Coarse parallel ribs also occur. Paint, however, is no longer employed. Typical of this period are certain handles :-the twisted rope handles belonging to jugs; handles like Fig. 8b; a shape with Early Helladic parallels (Fig. 9, No. 41); 'wing-handles' (Fig. 9, No. 119) 2; handles with vertical grooves; and strap handles on lids.3 Horse-shoe lugs, such as the pair adorning No. 335 on Fig. 9, are also late; so, too, are pedes- talled cups like Nos. 348 and 136 on P1. VII. The development of the bowl and the preference for a rounded profile in period III have already been mentioned: the over-lapping lid, which had started with a concavo-convex outline, and passed through a stage represented by No. I, (Fig. 6) now becomes definitely concave: the cutaway lips of jugs are no longer severe and angular, but curved and flamboyant as in No. 80 (Fig. 9). Jugs like No. 264 in Fig. 7, once so common, seem to have left no descendants. Three-legged cooking pots continue, but the handles are less high swung and the pointed knobs, very characteristic of the earlier period, have disappeared. A unique form is represented by part of a sauce-boat (No. I28), with a flat, simple spout resembling that of the gold sauce-boat from Troy,4 and of the examples from Tell al 'Ubaid and Lake Van 5 and one or two sherds from Macedonia." Contrast the high, mannerised forms which were in use on the Greek Mainland. Overlapping lids are associated at Troy with the face-urns, of which 1 No. 346 in Fig. 9 and No. I82 in P1.

Two- handled beakers were, like wheel-made pottery, a later invention.

It should be remembered that, with the exception of Troy itself, the Troadic sites were very self-contained and can rarely be dated by their imports from abroad, so that the typological dating offered here is subject to many corrections in so far as individual fabrics may have persisted much longer at one site than another. The absolute chronology is still more uncertain, but provisionally we may suppose 1 Another Trojan form which does not occur at Thermi is the hour-glass beaker.</page><page sequence="28">28 W. LAMB that the second period lasted from about 2700 to 2400 B.c. The third period was practically co-extensive with that represented by Schmidt's first division of the Troy II to V pottery, and probably corresponded with Schliemann's second city. It may therefore be dated between 2400 and 2000 B.c., or even Is8oo if we assume it to have lasted till the fall of Troy II. After that date the population dwindled, and the settlement proper was, as far as we can see, almost deserted. From the level of the late street, however, from the surface of I and H, and from the south-west test pits comes a rather fine red or grey ware coated with a fugitive pink slip; also fragments of an admirable red polished ware. Three whole pots, illustrated in Fig. Io, are paralleled in Troy VI, and handles of the same remarkable shape as S.S. 3137 suggest the same period.1 From the south-west test pits come certain later wares: Lesbian bucchero, one or two stems of LH III kylikes and a few other sherds which seem to belong to some later Mycenaean or sub-Mycenaean fabric. These districts will be more fully examined and their contents published during and after the next campaign.2 R. W. H. W.L. DESCRIPTION OF PLATES VI, VII. Pl.

The figurines from Asia Minor in general and from Troy in particular shew a surprising diversity of type. The same diversity characterises the figurines from Thermi, and here it is even more striking, for they come from a comparatively small town and an unexpectedly short period.</page><page sequence="31">EXCAVATIONS AT THERMI. 31 With one exception, no example either from the 1929 or the 193o excava- tions was found lower than 4 metres (actual level) or 2 m. below the surface: in other words, the lowest strata have not yet produced any terracottas. The one exception is a fragmentary figure from the dis- turbed part of F: there are also certain specimens from the dump. The latter can safely be assumed to come from the same strata as the rest, first because they conform in type, secondly because the workmen had, by the time they reached the bottom metre, become expert in finding such things. In contrast with the terracottas, the two stone figurines, Fig. 11 a and b, come from the strata below 4 m.: a, indeed, was close to virgin soil. The clay of which the terracottas were made is nearly always par- ticularly ill fired and friable; sieving the earth for missing heads was often attempted and always unsuccessful; it seems, therefore, certain that many of the missing parts have become dust. Some of the examples belong to definite types, others are hybrids, and a few are too fragmentary to be classified. With regard to the chronological sequence of these types, we can only say, after examining their distribution between the surface and 4 m., that the fiddle-shaped figures appear at a higher level than the rest, and that the 'dressed and ornamented' type has, so far, been found only between 5 and 4 m., and has been confined to two particular areas. Three of them actually come from the same room, B. 6 of the second city. Terracotta figurines wilh dress or ornament. 29. I. Plate VIII (back and front views). Female figure of reddish-black ware. Head, arms and base missing. Ht. .082 m. From B. II. house 6, depth ca. 4'15 m. The head was probably thicker than the head of No. 29.2, and the features and hair rendered plastically : the arms look as if they had been raised : the base would have been columnar. The interest of the figure lies in the costume. It is not certain whether two garments or one are represented: in the former case, we have a short tunic; in the latter, a dress which could well be described as p601covoo (I1. ix. 594). At the neck and below the waist are fringes or lines of embroidery: the fringe would be more appropriate to the short tunic, embroidery, perhaps an embroidered belt and collar, to the long dress. Notice the crossed straps across the breasts, a device associated with later Greek costume. They meet low down at the back, and are either sewn on to the line of embroidery or carried round the waist (in which case they are identical with the line incised above the ' fringe '). At the back of the neck, the ends of the collar are tied in a knot from which two strings depend. The necklace</page><page sequence="32">32 W. LAMB is rendered by punctured dots, and the ends of the fringe or embroidered belt below the waist are also punctured. For the cross-bands, cf. the figures from Kul Tepe and Adalia : 1 here, too, punctures and incision are used. The figures from Adalia appear to wear necklaces. Nearer geographically and to a certain extent stylistically is the upper part of a figure from Troy.2 29. 3. P1. VIII. Upper part of similar figure, of blackish ware. Ht. *o41 m. From B.

The reconstruction of the lower piece of the figure is uncertain, nor is it easy to explain the protuberance above the belt with three holes pierced round it. The punctured markings may represent em- broidery on short tunic or, less probably, tattooing on the naked chest. Had tattooing been practised we should almost certainly have found pintaderos like those in Macedonia. 29. 9. P1. VIII. Part of figure of uncertain sex, reddish-black ware. Ht. .o62 m.; from beneath the street which divides B and E, at 4"80 m. The head is missing; the legs are divided; the arms, indicated by rounded excrescences at the sides, seem related to those of No. 30. 41. Two bands cross the chest and a depression has been made where they meet. Terracotta figurines : columnar. 29. 2. P1. VIII. Figure, presumably female, of reddish clay, better baked than usual. Ht.

The arms, raised crescent-wise, are interesting, since they recall the late Mycenaean 'dollies.' The origin of the latter has long been obscure: whether or not our terracottas could throw light on it depends on whether any relevant material can be found belonging to the period between 2000zooo and 1400 B.C. 30.

An isolated head resembles No. 30. 28 so closely that we can assume it to belong to the same class. The type seems to be represented at Troy by Troja, p. 142, No. 71. Terracotta figurines with divided legs. 30. 41. Plate VIII. Headless figure of red-brown ware. Ht. .17 m. Unstratified. Eight other examples, fragmentary, one from 6-5"5 m., four from 5'5-5 m., two from 5-4"5 m., one unstratified. Are these figurines male or female? There is no indication of sex, but one is tempted to consider them the male counterpart of the obviously female columnar figures. On the other hand, the nearest parallel to the position of the arms is given by the lead figurine, possibly imported from the south- east, found in Troy II. This suggests that our figure had the lower arms raised diagonally towards the breasts in the manner associated with early female figures. Terracotta figurines: globular. 30. 8. P1. VIII. Pendant of blackish-red clay. Diam. "048 m., from 0, 5.75-5'25 m.

Ht. .06 m. From Z, 5-4"50 m. The incised decoration is remarkable: if the figure is reversed, we might compare Ilios, No. 412, where the eyes are divided by a couple of straight lines for brows. There would, however, be no parallel for the zigzag marking in this connection. Terracotta figurines : fiddle-shaped. (a) Simple type. 29.6b. P1. VIII. Lower half of body: brownish-red ware. Ht. 046 m. From B. IV. 2, south-west room, 5"5-5 m. Two other examples of this type were found, both in the first half- metre. The missing head and shoulders were probably of the shape illustrated in S.S. p. 279, i.e. they were more or less like the smaller end of a violin, or the head of an owl. Contrast the cruciform head and shoulders also associated with fiddle-shaped figurines. The type has been found in Crete, the Cyclades, Asia Minor, the Caucasus and Mesopotamia.' Though it flourished in the neolithic period, it seems to have survived into the Early Bronze Age: the Trojan 'owl figures,' a variation of the same type, are said to come from the second city. 1 See Evans, Palace of Minos, i. p. 48.

It is noticeable that more copper objects were found in the lower strata than in the higher, but as many of the objects in question were small and sharp, it may well be that they percolated downwards. Therefore we cannot be sure if it is accidental that round-headed pins start before square-headed pins: 2 possibly not, because the square-headed type seems to take the place of pins with round head and thickened neck like Fig. 12, No. 4. Fig. 12, No. 3 belongs to the type with end flattened and rolled up (cf. S.S. 6395): No. 18 is evidently another more fragmentary example. Nos. I and 4 have no exact parallel at Troy and the latter is confined to our lowest stratum. No. 2 probably resembled S.S. 6401, with its end divided into two pieces each rolled spirally. Needles like No. 16 are 1 Evans, Palace of Minos, i. p. 48, Fig. 13, No. 16. 2 The square-headed appear between 3 and 3"5 m., i.e. at a very low level, but below 3 m. only round-headed pins have been found.

These celts, which could be used as axe, adze or chisel, though belonging to the same class, vary in length, sharp- ness of butt and spread of cutting edge, while No. 30 has rudimentary flanges.2 Weapons are very rare.

LAMB Where no figures are given there are usually traces of these metals to be found, but too small to be recorded. They are not to be regarded as significant. Iron, when present, may quite well have been derived from the soil, and the small quantities of tin are probably accidental. As most of the specimens were more or less corroded, the water and carbon dioxide have been deduced and the composition calculated back to that of uncorroded metal. The specimens are almost entirely copper, in some cases containing nickel in similar quantities to those found in the Sumerian excavations. The tin is in small proportions, and I do not think it has been added intentionally, so that the objects are to be regarded as copper and not as bronze. No. 30/17 may be regarded as being practically pure lead. C. D. STONE. A. Celts and Axes. The celts and bored battle-axes from Thermi are eighteen in number. Among the former are examples of Tsoundas' type A with variations; and examples of type B, of which none, so far, have been found below 4"5 m.'; nothing, however, belonging to type A and no true repre- sentatives of type F. The tendency to make diagonal blades like those of Nos. 53 and 56 is a characteristic of the site: such blades occur else- where, but less frequently. Another characteristic is the absence of celts with one flat and one convex side. There are four battle-axes, all of which are paralleled at Troy, except the surface find 30/9. Those with curved butts are amongst the most important objects from the site. Only three others are known from Greek lands: the first from Sesklo, the second from Zerelia, the third from Hagios Mimas.2 The Hagios Mimas axe and ours are dateable, but not the other two. At Troy, the type includes, besides other humbler representatives, the magnificent axe of lapis lazuli and its fellows from treasure L. Further north, they extend from Jutland, where they may have originated, to South Russia. Thus they represent, at least, x Contrast the Olynthus celts, where type B was the earliest.

These are usually made of a soft local volcanic stone. Only one is bored through: the rest, four in number, have rudimentary borings at each side. Three are oval; one has a rounded end and a pointed end; the specimen that was bored through is too fragmentary for us to determine its shape. They were probably used for pounding corn.

The com- monest implement is a knife (see Fig. 17, Nos. 4-7), of which there were at least seven specimens, all fragmentary, from strata of all periods. They are made of flint or chert with longitudinal flakes, regular in some blades, irregular in others, and with little or no secondary work. The hand-axe or hoe, No. I, was found in r between 2"25 and 2oo00 m. No. 2 is a chip or scraper, from the second or third town. The beautiful but incomplete little blade No. 3,1 discovered at 3 m., is so far the only implement where pressure flaking has been used. No obsidian has been discovered, and this is remarkable since it was im- ported to Troy. Moreover, Lesbos itself is said to produce obsidian, but since neither we ourselves nor a local geologist working in the appropriate district could locate it, no doubt it eluded the prehistoric settlers as well.

Imported Material.-The material of many of these objects can be found on the island: two axes, however, are made of rock that is almost certainly imported. (i) Glaukophanite, No. 29/1. This, though well dis- tributed over the Aegean, is unknown in Lesbos. (ii) Emery (No. 29/3), does not occur either. Our specimen probably came from the Cyclades. I am indebted to Professor Ktenas, of the University of Athens, for this information. The marble of the three fragmentary bowls, though it appears to be Cycladic, cannot be identified with certainty. Their shape, however, is so typical that 1 Also illustrated as No. 29/8 on P1. X.</page><page sequence="47">EXCAVATIONS AT THERMI. 47 a Cycladic origin appears very probable. Gabbro, from which many of the celts are made, has not been found in Lesbos but occurs in north-west Asia Minor. BONE.

The comparatively small number from Troy may be due (I) to their being overlooked by the workmen; (2) to their belonging to the first city of which only a small area was excavated. Their attri- bution to the first city, though it would correspond with the stratification at Thermi, is conjectural; for their exact find-spot is unknown.

This can hardly be due to the'percolation' suspected in the case of the bronze needles, etc. (p. 35), for gouges and borers 1 with thick stems are found in the low levels, slender carved pins in the higher. To illustrate the distribution of certain types, notes were made of those from Towns IV and V and those belonging to earlier periods.2 I.

Other objects included spoons or spatulae (a), worked birds' claws (e), pointed deer's horns (b), and a large bone hammer (from E, 4-3.5 m.), like those found in Thessaly,' probably for crushing corn. MISCELLANEOUS OBJECTS. Many of these are important, since they provide points of contact with other parts of the Aegean. No. 6, Fig. 18 (from E, 2"5-2 m.) is part of a terracotta hook or hanger which could be nailed in place through the two holes: parallels have been found at Troy (S.S. 8835) and at Hagios Mimas. " The cylindrical spool or pestle, No. 7, found in E between 5 and 4"5 m., has counterparts from Troy (S.S. 8433), Zigouries, Yiriza, Gonia and the Cyclades3: they were usually, like ours, made of some veined decorative stone. For the bead, No. 5, from E, 3-2"5 m., cf. S.S. 7744. This, however, is ribbed rather than incised, so too is an elongated bead from Yortan at Berlin. The hollow conical objects may be terracotta phalloi 4 : stone phalloi occur at Troy,5 terracotta ones more widely, since they reached Bulgaria in the north and Platanos in Crete in the south." Fig. 16, i (from F, 2"85 m.), though of terracotta, was probably a burnisher like the stone S.S. 8683, from Troy, and the similar stone from Vardar6ftsa.' Fig. 16, k, may be a mould: a, a spit support.s There is one from Rakhmani not dissimilar though differing in profile.9 Nos. 8-io in Fig. 18 are perhaps Tretool, also found at Troy (S.S. 7676). One object, the plastic fragment, Fig. 18, No. I, and Fig. 16, h, from Z, 4-3"5 m., is, apparently, unique. It seems to represent a nose and mouth, but the mouth must be open for the edge here is rounded : there were also open holes to right and left of the nose. The reverse is smooth. 1 Wace and Thompson, op. cit. p. 72; A. .

SUMMARY. Thermi was colonised from Anatolia some time before 3000 B.C., at a period when Anatolia itself was occupied by a people apparently uni- form in culture and distinguished by a peculiar type of black pottery. The same race founded the first city of Troy and the first village on the Toumba of Protesilaos.' Thermi, however, was naturally in closer con- tact with the Cyclades and the other islands than were the inhabitants of Asia Minor : evidence of this contact is supplied by (I) the herring-bone decoration on the pottery, (2) the marble bowls and emery, probably imported, and (3)-possibly-the existence of one or two houses of the broader, less elongated type. Northern influence, on the other hand, is suggested by the battle-axes. It is obvious that the inhabitants, like other Early Bronze Age folk, were neither uncivilised nor unaccomplished. They melted and cast copper, though they continued to use the bone and stone implements of their predecessors. They knew how to produce good red wares in an oxidising atmosphere, though the potter's wheel was not yet in use. Several domestic animals-sheep, cows, pigs and dogs-played their part in the life of the town. The main occupation of most of the inhabi- tants must have been agriculture and fishing: that various grains 2 were under cultivation is proved by actual remains. The women-folk practised spinning and weaving, and, to judge from their fires and ovens, must have been tolerable cooks. Their taste in dress is indicated by the terracotta figures Nos. 29/1 and 29/3, in hairdressing, by No. 30/31. During the interval when Troy I was deserted and Troy II not yet built, Thermi continued to exist peacefully, shewing, however, certain curious features which were peculiar to this stage of its evolution. (Thermi III: bothroi and burnt earth areas.) It would seem that some of the well-known Anatolian sites came into existence about this time, such as the cemetery of Yortan in the Kaikos valley and, a little later, the village at Senirdje.3 1 The same race, at the same stage, perhaps, made the vase from Emed in Phrygia and the specimens from between Soma and Panderma in Mysia, J.R.A.I. 19o3, P. 373, Fig. 4; Ath. Mitt. Igo4, p. 287. 2 The grains, etc., will be identified more exactly and published in next year's report. 3 Frankfort, pp. 65-7. E2</page><page sequence="52">52 W. LAMB One of the great periods of prehistory opens with the founding of Troy II, the expansion of the Anatolian culture over Macedonia, and its influence in Greece and the islands. To this stage belong Boz Eyuk and Protesilaos III,1 Thermi IV and V. Troy, with its extensive foreign contacts, absorbed various alien elements which are absent at Thermi and other provincial sites: moreover, it developed faster. The people of Thermi, however, were sufficiently advanced to acquire a knowledge of metals other than copper, since iron and lead were used for ornaments. They now abandoned the broader type of house which was occasionally built in period I, and used only the long narrow type which Troy II has taught us to associate with Asia Minor. What caused the inhabitants to leave their home some time before the sack of Troy II and what was their subsequent history is a problem that can only be solved by investigation of the area outside the settlement and by further exploration of the island. W. LAMB. 1 Protesilaos IV is contemporary with the last stage of Troy II: see Demangel Protesilaos, p. 62. For Boz ]yuk, see Ath. Mitt. 1899, pp. I ft. It is uncertain when this site began but obvious that it continued later than Thermi.</page><page sequence="53">INDEX. 333 (vii) The stamped bricks and tiles, 226 ff.
