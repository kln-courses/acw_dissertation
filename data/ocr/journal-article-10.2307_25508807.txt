<plain_text><page sequence="1">Elizabeth Shee Twohig, THE MEGALITHIC ART OF WESTERN EUROPE Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1981. ?50.00 sterling. This volume will serve as an invaluable reference book for students of megalithic art. The material is drawn from a variety of monuments on the western seaboard of Europe. Irish readers will be particularly interested in the passage grave art of this country and will probably be disappointed that the ornament of the Boyne Valley is not catalogued. This is a major omission, even on a merely statistical level, because the Boyne material accounts for an estimated 70% of the decorated stones in Ireland and about 30% of the total in western Europe. Certain features of the Boyne ornament are, however, discussed in the section on Ireland. The catalogue entry for each decorated site is quite comprehensive. It includes details of the site, a summary of earlier accounts, a list of finds and a description of the decoration. The book contains 45 plates and 290 figures. Besides the illustrations of individual decorated stones, these figures contain plans of the monuments with the decorated stones indicated. The discussion comprises about one hundred pages of print interspersed with explanatory maps, tables and other figures. This relatively brief discussion ranges over a broad and complex subject. Consequently, certain arguments are not fully developed and theories seem to be accepted or rejected without a full presentation of the author's thinking. The ready acceptance of the theory that individual motifs in Ireland are symbolic is a case in point. The three main geographic areas ? Iberia, France and Ireland/Britain ? provide a natural division of the discussion. Within each of these areas, further regional units are established. In Iberia, a two-fold division is postulated with reference to technique, motif-content, style and associated structures. Motifs and style are also scrutinised in defining the French regional subdivisions, and C14 determinations are invoked in putting forward a putative sequence. In dealing with the Irish material, the author recognises a stylistic difference between the art of Fourknocks and that of the Loughcrew complex, which she suggests can be used to define two basic styles in Irish passage grave art. In attempting to establish sequences in the megalithic art tradition, the author relies heavily on radiocarbon determinations, particularly in the case of France. This approach seems commendable, because C14 can be a more objective determinant of chronology than any supposed development in the style of the art. However, there are many difficulties in using C14 to establish dates for specific decorative ensembles. Some of the problems are inherent in the dating technique itself. Whereas it is generally acknowledged that C14 is most accurate when a number of determinations is seen to indicate a particular chronological pattern, there is not</page><page sequence="2">128 BOOK REVIEWS sufficient evidence available that a suitable concentration of reliable radiocarbon dates is available for French megalithic tombs. Furthermore it seems to be taken for granted that the date of the structure is an accurate guide to the date of the art, though the author argues (on the basis of the art content, incidentally) that some of the ornament at Gavrinis was applied centuries after that tomb was constructed. It seems that C14 determinations can be applied to mural ornament, but only with extreme caution. The author consciously addresses certain problems relating to groupings, relationships, techniques, dating, interpretation, origins and functions. Such a programme of questions promises a formidable discussion. However, at the end of the book, the old controversial issues remain unsolved and there is no new insight into central issues such as the origins, functions and interpretation of the ornament. Now that a comprehensive catalogue of mainland western European megalithic art has been produced by Dr Twohig, perhaps a complementary catalogue is required of any supposedly related mobiliary art. This might have the effect of opening up new ideas about megalithic art. Twohig devotes much of the discussion to the context in which the ornament is found. In studying the art itself, her main approach revolves around motif-content. It seems from her usage of the term that her understanding of motif is 'a basic recurring unit of design' (such as a circle or spiral) rather than any recurring unit of design (which would include more complex patterns, such as combinations of basic devices). Even if one accepts the author's interpretation of the term itself, there are difficulties in comparing the various tables of motifs. Thus the net-pattern is shown in Fig 13 to be common to Iberia and Brittany, while it is not included as a basic motif in the individual tables for either area. Fig 13 records the percentage frequency of various motifs in each of the three main areas. The author might have chosen to insert here a debate on the usefulness of this particular table. It seems to this reviewer that to judge the relationship between two decorative complexes on the basis of the frequency of all or any particular motifs in the two complexes pre-supposes a significance for these motifs which we are not at present justified in taking for granted. The simple presence/absence of motifs is perhaps a better guide in establishing relationships, given our present uncertainty regarding the exact function of the motifs. In fact, an intensive analysis of compositional features might prove more rewarding in establishing connections between various complexes. One of the most elusive problems in the study of Irish megalithic art is that of symbolism. Twohig accepts that the motifs are symbolic but devotes little attention to establishing the validity of her view. She confines herself to a statement that the motifs should be regarded as symbolic because they do not always form into conscious designs. It seems to me that the great variety which is evident in the quality of design throughout the distribution of passage grave art in Ireland is indeed significant in this context, but only when it is contrasted with the somewhat conservative array of basic motifs which is drawn upon throughout. The fact that individual genius found expression in new compositional ideas rather than in the creation of new devices may indicate that these devices were inherently significant and perhaps symbolic. Lest it be argued that only simple and arguably abvious motifs recur, attention is here drawn to a more complex device which may be found both in the Boyne Valley and in Loughcrew. This motif has a rayed semi-circular format with dots at the extremities of the rays and one or more cupmarks at the centre. It is the basis of a sophisticated design on a kerbstone near the eastern tomb at Knowth and is repeated less memorably elsewhere at Knowth (PRIA 66C, Fig 30), Loughcrew (Fig 244) and Newgrange (PPS 39, Fig 7, 13). The recurrence of this rather complex device in the three sites adds force to the argument that there was an inherent significance in such motifs. Some commentators have offered the rather daring opinion that certain combinations of motifs can be interpreted as semi-abstract facial images. This concept differs essentially from</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 129 the notion of symbolism in individual motifs. Whereas the anthropomorphic interpretation is inspired mainly by visual impact, the idea of symbolism in each motif derives from a process of thought. Herity (1974) gathered together a number of designs from Ireland and Britain which could arguably, with varying degrees of optimism, be regarded as anthropomorphic. Twohig's dismissal of the anthropomorphic theory seems cavalier, being based mainly on the opinion that no foreign analogies exist for the supposed anthropomorphs. Given that more than 50% of the material remains of the megalithic mural art tradition occurs in Ireland and that the passage graves in Ireland reached new heights in architectural splendour, the occurrence here of unique elements in the art would not be unexpected. This reviewer can find no conclusive indication that anthropomorphic images are a conscious element in passage grave art. It is therefore with extreme caution that one concedes the point that certain designs are visually suggestive of anthropomorphic abstraction. Certainly, such designs are to be found at Sess Kilgreen, Fouknocks, the Boyne area and elsewhere. While the sceptics may not be totally convinced by the anthropomorphic arguments, there are some telling indications that these arguments may not be without some substance. For example, the designs which appear most convincingly anthropomorphic tend to occur in the chamber area of tombs. Twohig displays much less caution in her approach to the French 'buckler' motif, which she readily accepts as an anthropomorphic image. Many instances of this motif are visually much less convincing than the supposed Irish anthropomorphs. Twohig, however, is satisfied that the French motif can be compared with the Iberian statue-menhirs and must therefore be anthropomorphic. In the course of her discussion, the author queries whether, in fact, megalithic carvings can be regarded as authentic art. This is a central issue, involving questions about symbolism, design and other aesthetic facets of the ornament. The matter is not analysed in depth, however, and the question remains largely unanswered. To the modem viewer, these carvings are primarily visual phenomena and notwithstanding speculation regarding their function and possible symbolism, they can profitably be studied with reference to certain accepted principles of design. This philosophy seems to be the basis of Twohig's approach to the Irish material. Two styles are defined in Ireland. The Four knocks style is interpreted as having the motifs "integrated to form a coherant design and arranged to give a pleasing overall effect". By contrast, the Loughcrew style does not attempt "to achieve an overall artistic effect". Obviously, these contrasting styles are seen to best effect in the two type sites. The author seems quite justified in recognising a certain distinction between the Fourknocks ornament and the Loughcrew material. The definition which she offers for this distinction may not receive universal approval, however, and it is questionable whether this twofold definition of style can be applied to the full corpus of Irish megalithic art, embracing distinctive elements in the design content of the major Boyne complexes. It is apparent, even from a brief survey of the art in both complexes, that the ornament in the Fourknocks tomb, based mainly on repetitive patterns, appears to be more neatly arranged than that at Loughcrew, though patterning is not entirely absent from Loughcrew (Cairn U, C9). One cannot rule out the possibility that the neatness of the Fourknocks decoration may be a function of the rather flat surfaces of some stones in the structure rather than of an adherence to a specific stylistic preference. More fundamental, however, is the apparent equation by Twohig of neatness and regularity with "artistic effect". It is possible, for example, that certain designs at Loughcrew (Fig 244) may be compositionally more subtle than the more neatly arranged patterns at Fourknocks The decorative effect may be more pleasing at Fourknocks, but this primacy need not extend to artistic effect. While Twohig's twofold division of the Irish material has the advantage of being broad and relatively simple, it is not easily applied to the rich Boyne assemblages. For example, much of</page><page sequence="4">130 BOOK REVIEWS the Knowth material, especially in the western tomb, seems difficult to analyse in terms of this model because of certain unique qualities in the design content of the decoration. It might be more profitable to classify the designs using other criteria. Thus, some designs are based on repeating patterns, some are formed from a single bold device (e.g. a multiple concentric circle figure), some are created from an arrangement of various motifs, some appear to lack any formal arrangement and so on. This method of classifying the ornament is not confined to a definite number of classes but can be readily expanded to incorporate new material. Despite reservations about her definition of two Irish styles, one must compliment the author for emphasising design as a crucial variable in passage grave art. The following remarks may help to clarify the subject. The individual device is perhaps the most basic element in megalithic design. This device may be a simple circle or lozenge, or it may be a more complicated figure (Sess Kilgreen C6). Frequently this single device may be part of a group of figures, arranged into a composition which is sometimes related to the contours and outline of the stone. In a few cases (e.g. Gavrinis and Knowth) the designs on a number of contiguous stones seem to form a single ornamental ensemble. Design, therefore, may be discussed hierarchically in terms of a single device, an arrangment of devices, or an arrangement of art-bearing stones. The location of decorated stones in French megalithic tombs is briefly discussed in the book. The author has not, however, included an incisive analysis of the positioning of decorated stones in Irish tombs. Yet it is apparent from a general survey that ornamented stones tend to cluster in the chamber area and, in the case of kerbs, near the entrances. A full survey would establish this fact more firmly and could be summarised in a telling graphic form. The importance of location in terms of the function and suggested symbolism of the art would also repay further study. To summarise, therefore, one might define as the main contribution of this book the fact that it reveals virtually in toto the field of mainland European megalithic mural art for English langauge readers. Associated monuments and finds are catalogued, and the main technical variations are surveyed. The discussion summarises most of the principal questions that have been raised about the art during the past few decades. The most regrettable omissions from the catalogue are the Boyne decorated stones and the European mobiliary art which is an important component of the megalithic tradition. The discussion is no more than a summary, with the result that arguments are not presented in depth. The brevity of the discussion demands a glossary setting out the author's definition of such terns as motif, symbolism, design, style, sequence. It seems a pity that such a glossary is not included, since this book will undoubtedly stand as an important source of reference in the future. Muiris O'Sullivan</page></plain_text>
