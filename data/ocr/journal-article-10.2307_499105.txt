<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ORIGIN OF THE GREEK HERM 1 THIS study concerns itself with the origin and form of the classical herm as it has been handed down to us in Greek art. In his monograph, Die antike Herme, Ludwig Curtius came to the conclusion that it developed out of the marker set up over the grave. The piling up of stones by the wayside in honor of Hermes 2 he compares with the custom of various peoples, notably the Hebrews, of throwing stones on graves as a tribute to the dead.3 In general, he subscribes to the idea that the herm devel- oped out of an original aniconic sacred stone into the semi-anthropomorphic herm of classical type through the transformation, if I understand his theory correctly, of the grave monument into the cult image of the god of the dead, Hermes, the con- ductor of souls. This form, as we know from archaeological evidence, was fixed some time in the last quarter of the sixth century and became current on vase-paintings during the last decade.4 It may, of course, have been in use for some time before it entered the field of art. There can be no doubt that the gods of Greece were venerated under the form of stones, pillars, and pyramids, and that these rude monuments continued to exist side by side with the fully developed anthropomorphic statue until a late date. For this we have literary evidence, notably that of Pausanias. He saw so many formless objects of worship on his wanderings that he sums them all up, perhaps more cate- gorically than authoritatively, with the phrase: "In the olden times all Greeks worshipped unwrought stones instead of images."'5 To this, Clement of Alexandria adds his testimony." But that in the particular instance of the herm an original rude stone did not persist but was transformed into the herm of classical form and that 1 R. Lullies, Die Typen der griechischen Hermen, gives a very full set of illustrations and a convenient classification. He believes that the herm developed from an aniconic pillar which gradually was given a more human form; later it was stylized in the spirit of a conscious and partial return to the more primi- tive form. His conclusions seem to me to rest on an incorrect dating of the monuments he cites as evi- dence. 2Curtius, Die antike Herme, 1903, p. 10. "Es besteht zwischen Herme und Hermaia eine enge Ver- wandschaft. Nicht nur werden die beiden Male dem Hermes errichtet, zuweilen in Verbindung mit- einander, und stehen an Wegen: die Herme teilt mit dem Steinhaufen die anikonische Natur. Bilden hier aufgeschichtete Steine ein Kultdenkmal, so lebt dort in dem viereckigen Pfeiler noch der &amp;py5s Aftos der freilich durch Kopf, Phallus und Seitenansaetze zum &amp;ya~hpa geworden ist." In an article, "Phallosgrabmal im Museum von Smyrna," Festschrift Ludwig Klages, 1932, p. 26, Curtius reiterates his original statement on the origin of the herm, although, as he says, no monument corroborating his theory has come to ligbt on Greek soil in the years intervening between the two publications. Deubner ("Der ithyphallische Hermes," Corolla Curtius, p. 202) expresses the opinion that the stone from which the herm developed was not a grave marker, but a sign-post (Wegzeichen) crowning a stone cairn. His theory, too, is evolutionary: "Der Malstein wandelte sich zur Herme." Wilamowitz (Der Glaube der Hellenen, p. 159), derives the herm from the cairn and the stone pillar: "Wenn jener zu dem Sitze eines Gottes wird, der die Wanderer auf ihren Wegen . . . schUitzt, so schiitzt der Pfeiler das Haus." 3 Liffel, Beitrdge zur Geschichte von Montjoie, pp. 43-53, discusses this custom and cites interesting comparative material. 4 The black-figured vases depicting the herm, so far as I have been able to check them, all belong to a late phase of that style.

Characteristic of the herm, as Curtius remarks, are the rectangular shaft, the phallos, and the "arms" or side brackets; to which one must add the fully devel- oped bearded head. For it is just this contrast between head and shaft which consti- tutes the peculiarity of the herm, and which makes it difficult to accept the theory of Curtius. He himself points out that while there is literary evidence of late date 7 connecting the herm with the grave, it is strange that the only actual examples he can produce from Greece itself are two small Thessalian grave stelae on which there are, indeed, herm-like markers with side brackets, but which are not of classical FIG. 1.-PRIMITIVE STELAE, CURTIUS, Die antike Herme, FIGS. 4, 5, 8, 10 form, with fully developed head and phallos. To judge by the epigraphy and style, they cannot be earlier than the end of the third century B.c. Of all the Greek states, Thessaly was the one most open to foreign and barbaric influences from the North and it is primarily the barbaric character of the examples gathered by Curtius from various parts of Europe and Anatolia which makes it impossible to accept them as prototypes of the Greek herm. What connection can there possibly be between the severely stylized herm and the repulsively crude dolmes of Collorgnes (fig. 1, left = Curtius, figs. 4 and 5), or the stele covered with geometric patterns and eel-like ani- mals (fig. 1, top right = Curtius, fig. 8), unless we can assume that a very long period 7 Cicero, de Leg. ii, 26, 65 (58). Curtius, op. cit., p. 20: "Hier ist von einem Luxusgesetz die Rede . . . Dieses verbietet Hermen auf Graeber zu setzen. Daraus geht hervor, dass dies zur zeit des Verbots geschah. Um so merkwuerdiger, dass sich bisher in Attika . . kein Beispiel eines Grabes mit einer Herme hat finden lassen."</page><page sequence="3">60 HETTY GOLDMAN of evolution intervened? But none of the monuments can be shown to be of very early date. The Pompeian stelae (fig. 1, bottom right = Curtius, fig. 10) too are late in date. We lack, indeed, transitional monuments in which an emergent anthropo- morphism confined to the head alone would form the link between the primitive and the ultimate concept.8 Nor does the phallos appear on any of the supposed proto- types. Something crudely resembling side brackets, hardly apparent, as Curtius himself remarks, on the only illustration given, is said to characterize grave stelae from Neandria in the Troad.9 These monuments, however, cannot be dated and are so rude in style that they may have been created locally at almost any time either by the indigenous population or by backward peoples coming into Anatolia from across the straits. Yet it is specifically on these Neandria stones that Curtius based his theory of the origin of the Greek herm.10 Eitrem, in his article on Hermai," recognizes the unsatisfactoriness of explaining the herm solely as a grave marker and points in the right direction, I believe, when he says: "Die Herme ist von vornherein nicht Grabmal allein, wie vielfach angenom- men wurde, . . . sie war tiberhaupt ein Phylakterion gegen alle baisen Geister." He recognizes that the side brackets cannot originally have been intended for the use to which they were sometimes put: that is, for hanging up wreaths or acting as sign- or mile-posts.12 "Vielleicht," he says, "sind sie die verkiimmerten Reste der Stangen, wodurch die Herme zu einem Gelainder, wie die spitere Verwendung es nahe legt, verbunden wurden." There is, however, no evidence to show that early herms were thus united to form a balustrade and a great deal to show that they were single fig- ures standing by an altar, a door-way, or the wayside. Leonidas (of Tarentum) thus addresses the rustic herm: "Caves and holy hill of the Nymphs, and springs at the rock's foot, and thou pine that standest by the water; thou square Hermes, son of Maia, guardian of the sheep . . ." 13 If, then, we look for the origin of the herm of classical form, not among the grave monuments and not in the sphere of Hermes X66vios or TuXoirop-r6s, but among the ancient gods of fertility and of the countryside, I think we may be more successful. Hermes, protector of the flocks and of the pastures upon which they graze, has as his com- panions the phallic gods, Dionysos, Pan, and such lesser spirits of the woods as are depicted by the Pan Painter,'4 and the one to whom Kephalos the hunter offers his libation.15 The former vase-painting gives the characteristics of the true herm, though in exaggerated form, if one may interpret the black blob of paint on the side as an "arm." The monument on the Kephalos vase is a variant, but also has "arms." 16 8 When the god Hermes appears on Corinthian pottery in the seventh century, it is the anthropo- morphic form.

A bearded mask is attached to a post (fig. 2) 18 or shaft (fig. 5) 19 and the whole clothed with garments. On the Makron painting (fig. 5), the costume consists of a chiton and himation, on the Deinos painting, of a chiton and belted sleeveless overgarment. The post is certainly of wood and the shaft is probably of the same material. On a third vase with similar representation the shaft is set in a rectangular base.20 Now, it is impossible to drape a garment about a slender pole such as is depicted on the vase of the Deinos painter, or even on the shaft of the Makron image, unless some further support is afforded, for it would inevitably slip to the ground. It is quite clear that this support is some cross piece at the level of the shoulders on both vase-paintings, for here the greatest width is indicated on figure 2, and on figure 5 one can just see to either side the ends of side brackets protruding from the drapery. From them sprout the grape vine and ivy branches, and on another vase cakes are attached to the bracket ends (fig. 4).21 Remove the garment and we have the essential characteristics of the herm: the fully developed bearded head, the stunted "arms" and the shaftlike "body." Indeed, was not this apotropaic figure which protected the vineyards of ancient Greece composed very much like that apotropaic figure of our own fields: the common scarecrow? To be sure, the latter has lost the attributes of divinity, if ever he had them, and is po- tent only in the sphere of the practical, but his body, like that of his ancient proto- type, consists of a pole and cross-bar, from which garments are hung; his apotropaic powers are strong in proportion to his resemblance to man, or, in other words, to his partial anthropomorphism. What was preserved for later generations in the worship of the rustic Dionysos was once characteristic of many gods, for the custom of weaving garments for statues could only have arisen at a time when the full anthropomorphic statue had not yet evolved. Even the ppE'ras of Athena, depicted on vase-paintings, is probably an advance over the original form of the goddess. Pausanias records the use of garments not only for Athena and Hera, but for a number of masculine deities.22 It is my be- lief, then, that the side brackets of the herm do not represent rudimentary or stylized arms, but were in origin functional and developed at a time when the primitive statue, pillar, pole or rectangular shaft, was habitually draped, in order to support the garment and keep it from slipping off. We have some evidence that the herm itself was sometimes draped, although drapery was certainly not a necessary or even customary part of its equipment by the end of the sixth century.

It is further interesting to note that the cult image, consisting of pole or shaft with cross-bar or brackets, to which mask and garments were added, would, when stripped of all these accessories, have looked very much like the mast of the ship on which the peplos of Athena was stretched and carried to the Acropolis. I note the resemblance but do not feel that it is possible to establish a definite connection. The form of the mast may have significance, as embodying the original appearance of the goddess herself, but it is difficult to prove. The mask was not originally used solely for Dionysos. The orator Hyperides 24 tells us that Dodonian Zeus, apparently voicing the annoyance of the priests at the shabby appearance of the image of Dione, ordered the Athenians, through an oracular response, to send her a new dress, ornaments and a rrp6acowrrov, a counte- nance or, in other words, a mask.25 Now Dodona was a great and very ancient shrine and Dione ranked among the old and august goddesses. Rhea and Themis were her contemporaries and companions. Sometimes she is known as the mother of Diony- sos, sometimes of Aphrodite.26 She is so old and venerable that she is half forgotten and Hesiod does not mention her among the consorts of Zeus.27 Here, then, we have the combination of mask and garment, attested for one of the oldest deities. But it still remains to justify the attribution to the rustic Hermes of those ancient aspects of the sacred image which we know to have survived in Dione of Dodona and in the rustic Dionysos. Here, religious tradition, poetry, and vase-painting come to our aid and show clearly how closely the two gods are associated and how their iconic forms were sometimes merged in one. In the Kabeiric mysteries of Samo- thrace, the fourth Kabeiros, Ko''thNos, is identified with Hermes: " uoOvT-rax s Ev Tiapop op(XK Trois KapEipol ... 0 6E TrpoUo-rIPEVOS -rapros Ko-lpAoS 6 '"Eppcis oY-riv, cs iT-ropEi A10ovu60opoS." 28 The identification of Kasmilos with Hermes is also mentioned by Kallimachos.29 In Thebes, however, the older Kabeiros is identified with Dionysos. Here, too, Hermes is intimately connected with the birth legend of Dionysos. In an epigram from the island of Lesbos,30 Hermes is called upon to bring the blessings of abundant yield to the vineyard, of which Dionysos, 23 AA. 5, 1910, p. 457, Abb. 1.

And who would not identify the image on the vase-picture (fig. 6)31 as Dionysos if he did not see the staff of Hermes in his left hand? For the image wears a headdress characteristic of Dionysos, similar to that crowning the mask on the vase of the Deinos painter (fig. 2), a Dionysiac embroidered robe, and he holds in the right hand the cup of the god of wine, while a satyr dances behind and a cloaked Maenad stands before him. Here, indeed, we seem. to have the merging of the two deities in a single rustic statue. Gerhard, in his Uber Ursprung, Bedeutung und Anwendung der Hermen,32 an essay full of acute observations, emphasizes the strong Dionysiac element in the herm. "Vielmehr draingt bei unbefangener Betrachtung dieser . . . Hermen die Ansicht sich auf als mige dem Gott der ihrer Bildung den Nahmen gab nur ein kleiner Theil bairtiger Hermen angehoiren . . . whihrend die grtssere Zahl jener fraglichen Hermen wahrscheinlich dem Dionysos gehirt." The very fact that the caduceus is painted on the side of some examples (fig. 7)33 shows that the identification of the herm was not always certain and could not be taken for granted, otherwise the symbol of the god would have been unnecessary. The herm of figure 8,34 for instance, I take to be a Dionysos and the spotted object on the breast a stylized nebris. In an article, Statuen auf Vasenbildern,35 Schefold reproduces an exceedingly inter- esting scene on a red-figured loutrophoros (fig. 9). A herm stands behind an altar at an open door which is approached by a wedding procession led by a flute-player. Schefold comments upon the fact that rarely, as in this case, are herms made larger than the people who surround them, that the head, seen frontally, has the uncanny look of the Dionysiac masks and that it seems alive with daemonic fire. He thinks that the vertical lines of thinned glaze delimit the sides of the herm which must be thought of as turned forward like the leaves of a triptych, in a curious experiment in perspective, which represents sides and front as if in one plane.36 If, however, we study the treatment of perspective in paintings approximately contemporary with this vase and all still of the fifth century (fig. 10),37 we see at once that the Greek vase-painter had, in reality, much more advanced ideas about perspective and that, whatever the shortcomings and mistakes of his treatment, he always makes an ef- fort to differentiate planes. He knows that the two sides of a rectangular object are not visible simultaneously with the front (fig. 10, 1 and 2). It seems to me quite clear that what the vase-painter wished to depict was not the sides of the shaft, but a cloak or drapery falling to the base. Schefold's description seems to me to lead di- 31 Rumpf, "Die Religion der Griechen," Bilderatlas zur Religionsgeschichte 13-14, fig. 67, from Monumenti Antichi dei Lincei xiv, pl. 56 (Orsi). 32 Gerhard, Archdologischer Nachlass, p. 217. 33 CVA.

This is no ordinary stone herm, such as stood beside Athenian door-ways. The shaft is of wood, a roughly trimmed tree-trunk, as is shown by the side brackets. They are circular, instead of rectangular, and are noth- ing more than the chopped-off ends of branches. From the shoulders sprouts foliage and the head, as Schefold remarked, resembles nothing so much as a Dionysiac mask. The herm is approached by a wedding procession, headed by a flutist, and a young girl carrying a loutrophoros follows; then come a female torch-bearer leading a child, a dancer and a second torch-bearer leading the bride. A cloaked woman brings up the rear. The procession is closely paralleled on a loutrophoros in Athens. No bridegroom appears in the procession,38 and yet he may be present, symbolically at least, in the wooden image at the altar. For this procession is not approaching the door of a secular house - the unique character of the wooden herm, the awe-inspiring character of the countenance, make this clear -but of a sacred precinct or temple. FIG. 10.--PERSPECTIVE IN LATE FIFTH-CENTURY VASE-PAINTING The god whose face is a mask, who wears a garment, and from whose shoulders sprouts foliage (cf. fig. 9), can be no other than Dionysos and, more specifically, in connection with a wedding procession, the Dionysos of the mystic marriage: the iEapS yd~po between the Basilinna, the wife of the king archon, and the god him- self.39 The elements of which the figure is composed are characteristic, as we have seen, not of Hermes, but of Dionysos, and no other god could the wedding proces- sion so fittingly approach. Dr. Margarete Bieber, in her discussion of the frescoes of the Villa Item at Pompeii,40 which she interprets as brides being initiated into the Dionysiac mysteries, suggests that at Athens the initiation took place under the direction of the Basilinna. I am not the first to propose a herm for the Dionysos of the mystic marriage. Van Hoorn41 accepted a herm in principle, although he had 8s Schefold is certainly mistaken in identifying the flutist and the girl carrying the loutrophoros as bride and bridegroom. This would necessitate transferring the title of bride from the majestic cloaked figure with bent head (cf. the vase illustrated in Deubner, Attische Feste, pl. 19), to the girl who walks before her. That a bridegroom would play the flute in his own wedding procession is more than improbable. 39 There is a great deal of literature on this subject. Much of it is quoted in Deubner, Attische Feste, and Buschor, "Ein choregisches Denkmal," AM. 53, 1928, pp. 96 ff.; Nilsson "Die Prozessionstypen im griechischen Kult," Jdl. xxxi, 1916, pp. 309-339. 40 Bieber, "Der Mysteriensaal der Villa Item," Jdl. xliii, 1928, pp. 298 ff.; "The Mystery Frescoes in the Mystery Villa of Pompeii," The Review of Religion, 1937, pp. 3 ff. 41 Van Hoorn, "L'Idole de Dionysos Limnaios," RA. 25, 1927, pp. 104 ff. He suggests that the herm was laid beside the Basilinna. We know nothing of the details of the ceremony of mystic union. He</page><page sequence="10">THE ORIGIN OF THE GREEK HERM 6s7 no definite illustration to offer. An image so primitive that it is not so much the work of a sculptor as an assemblage of diverse parts, meets the objection of Pfuhl 42 that the Dionysos could not have been a statue because it goes back to a period ante- dating sculpture. It is not necessary to think of the bride of the wedding procession as the Basilinna herself, nor can the procession be successfully localized; for the loutrophoros suggests the trip to the Enneakrounos, and the herm, altar, and door the arrival at the house of the bridegroom. The vase depicts not so much a definite moment in a given cere- mony as the whole course of the marriage, from its preparation, symbolized by the loutrophoros of the bridal bath, to the consummation, symbolized by the Dionysos of the iEpbs ydros. Thus the cycle of our evidence is completed. This Dionysiac figure takes us back to a time far more ancient than that in which the herm first appears on vase-paintings. It is the archetype of both the classical herm and of the Dionysiac image with mask and cloak; 43 for here the brackets are not mechanically added, as they must have been in the case of a pole or pillar, but are part of an origi- nal tree-trunk.44 I shall now sum up briefly the conclusions reached in this study. The herm of clas- sical form was not the end product of a long evolution starting from an aniconic sacred stone, an evolution for which it is impossible to find satisfactory evidence,45 nor was it an entirely new creation. It was the adaptation to stone sculpture, and for a new purpose, of a type which had long dotted the countryside and which had found its most important embodiment in the Dionysos of the mystic marriage. It consisted of wooden shaft, brackets, a mask, and garment. Doubtless the fine gar- ments were not worn at all times by statues standing in the open and exposed to the inclemencies of the weather, so that the undraped shaft was a familiar sight. If, as now seems evident, the type was originally created for Dionysos and trans- ferred from him to Hermes, the phallic symbol finds its natural explanation. Ancient authorities agree in attributing the origin of the classical herm to the Athenians. Herodotus tells us that the herm came to the Athenians from the Pelasgians,46 thus attesting its great antiquity, and that the Greeks as a whole took it over from the Athenians. Pausanias tells us that the Athenians invented, not the herm itself, but its rectangular form."4 In the transposition from wood to stone this is just the change which would naturally be made; for in stone it is less laborious to produce a rectangu- suggests tentatively that a herm on an oinochoe (his pl. iv) may represent the Dionysos, but adds that it may equally well represent Hermes. This youthful, beardless herm, with no Dionysiac attributes, which is approached by a child with a toy, cannot possibly be the venerable and secluded god of the Boukoleion. 42 Pfuhl, De Atheniensium Pompis Sacris, p. 70. 43 Petersen, "Lenaien oder Anthesterien," RhM. 68, 1913, pp. !39 ff., identifies the pillar and mask god with Dionysos of the sacred marriage. 44 The image of Dionysos, brought annually from Eleutherae to Athens, was also of wood; Pau- sanias i, 38, 8.

Otherwise our views have little in common. 46Herodotos ii, 51: Tro' 1-EAayCAV TPpATOl giv p'EAAi~vcov &amp;T-rQVTCOV 'A1rvaiot Trapaap16vrTE -rrap&amp; 6- -ro-roov &amp;Aot. 47 Pausanias iv, 33, 3: 'Aenvaicyv y&amp;p T-r6 o'aXpa -ro -rE-rpahyov6v aT-rlv E'rri Trois Eplpa!s, Kai Ttrap&amp; TOT-rCrOv lEpaaejKaaclv oa &amp;a0ol.</page><page sequence="11">68 HETTY GOLDMAN lar than a circular form. And if this was done in the time of Hipparchos and under his direction,48 the earliest appearance of herms on vase-paintings would coincide with the multiplication and spread of herms throughout Attica. A few words should be added concerning the meaning of plppa. It is generally interpreted as either an ordinary stone,49 or as the upright stone marker crowning the stone heap.50 I think, however, that a good case can be made for considering the original meaning to lie in the idea of upright, what is in itself upright or what main- tains upright or supports, rather than in the material of which such uprights were frequently made, namely a stone. The first definition given in Liddell-Scott is, "prop, support." As attached to the stone the meaning is derivative and secondary. The following literary passages seem to support this interpretation: Iliad i, 485 ff.: vI(a p~Pv o~i yE piaivayv Trv ' r lTrEipolo puooav 0yo0 -rri wlap60otoS, rrO 8' Eppla-ra lpaKp ardvvooav Nowadays in Greece and in general in the eastern Mediterranean, small ships beached on the shore are as a rule supported from either side by long wooden props, not by stones.

The form ~ppiv or Eppis, in the sense of a bed-post, and thus a thing that is itself upright, occurs twice in the Odyssey: 8,278: &amp;apPi 8' ap' Epl.laTIV XEE EO 8'0paTa KUKXCA) aTr'VrT1 23,198: ppiv' a&amp;aK ila5, TTplvaX 8 TrvT-ra rpTEpETpcp) Galen 19,f08: CdAorEp EplpaTros Ei 8E6PEvol TIS Tpo(piS.

Eppaa in this passage is frequently translated as "sunken stone," which is cor- rect from the point of view of the navigator. It may equally well be thought of, however, as a rock which stands upright or protrudes from the ocean bed. HETTY GOLDMAN INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY PRINCETON 4s Pseud.
