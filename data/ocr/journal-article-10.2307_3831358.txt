PHILLIPS UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII Jane Harrison and Modernism THE CLASSIC AL SCHOLAR and anthropologist Jane Harrison (1850-1928) helped formulate several ideas about art and life that became commonplace in the twentieth century. In such books as Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion (1903), Themis (1912), and, especially important for Modernist literature, Ancient Art and Ritual (1913), she synthesized and transmitted important views. Drawing on anthropologists and philosophers such as Emile Durkheim, Henri Bergson, William James, and Friedrich Nietzsche, she added her own insights and left a legacy which influenced not only her own disciplines but also literary criticism and literature. Harrison has only occasionally received the acknowledgment she deserves, from Modernists themselves or from critics.1 Virginia Woolf paid tribute to Harrison by corresponding with the New Statesman in 1920 to answer Arnold Bennett's and Desmond McCarthy's claim that women were inferior to men in intellectual power. Refuting this charge with examples, Woolf culminated her list of intellectually powerful women with Harrison's name.2 Woolf also offered homage to Harrison in A Room of One's Own (1929) when she adopted her as a model for "J?H?" at "Fernham."3 Fernham is no doubt Newnham, founded in 1872, one of two women's colleges within Cambridge 1 To situate Harrison with other myth theorists, see Robert A.

Harrison arrived there in 1874, after education at home by governesses in her upper-middle-class family and at Ladies' College, Cheltenham.4 Newnham served some 215 students over its first ten years, although most of these women were teachers who were supplementing their education for just one or two terms. Only twenty women of the first 215 read for the final examination.5 Yet even these women who passed the same final exams as the men did received a "certificate," not a "degree." Cambridge did not grant degrees to women that were acknowledged as degrees until 1948. (By comparison, Oxford began to call its female graduates degree-holders in 1919.6) From 1880-1897, Harrison studied Greek art and archaeology at the British Museum in London, also traveling extensively to archaeological sites and museums. She gave public lectures at the British Museum and in the provinces. In 1898, Newnham College made Harrison a Fellow, so that she did some lecturing and mostly pursued her research, contributing (with Gilbert Murray, Francis Cornford, and others) to a group called the Ritualists. Harrison was apparently a powerful voice in this group. Robert Ackerman claims that "she was the center" because she could offer a wide and deep knowledge of Greek art and archaeology, and later of contemporary work on religion, psychology, sociology and philosophy, that was invaluable to [A. B.] Cook, originally a folklorist; to Murray, originally a literary and textual scholar; and to Cornford, originally a student of philosophy. And, reciprocally, their work extended her own areas of interest and competence, so that their collaboration must have been deeply satisfying and exciting in an intellectual sense.7 Ackerman argues that Harrison's section of Mythology and Monuments of Ancient Athens (1890) made it "the first book of the Cambridge Ritualists, even though Miss Harrison had at this time not even met Murray, Cornford or Cook."8 Harry Payne similarly underlines that "As early as 1890, at first apparently innocent of the virtually simultaneous developments in the thought of [James G.] Frazer and W. Robertson Smith, she had begun to formulate her ideas on the primacy of ritual over myth."9 Payne corrects the view that Harrison and the whole Ritualist group were "followers of a single thinker," either Frazer or Nietzsche. In 1909 she called Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy "real genius" and acknowledged her debt to Durkheim for the social origin of religion, but even the ideas of these two "contradictory figures" she synthesized in an original way: "... Harrison tended to reduce other thinkers to her needs?molding as 4 Ackerman, p. 210. 5 Sandra J.

When she published Mythology and Monuments, she "attained a certain scholarly celebrity; she was invited to join the German Archaeological Society and was awarded honorary doctorates from Durham and Aberdeen universities."11 Soon after Prolegomena appeared, "the examiners ofthe Classical Tripos (crusty old gentlemen though they might have been) asked no fewer than five questions related directly to the book. This alone suggests a readier acceptance of Harrison's approach among the 'establishment' than [recent biographer] Sandra Peacock would have us believe."12 At her death Murray judged that her Prolegomena had "transformed the whole approach to the study of Greek religion"; he regarded Themis as "a great advance on the Prolegomena," although less favorably received because it was "too full of new ideas."13 Themis emphasized archaic survivals in Classical Greece, the origin of the concept of a daimon from the projection of group desire, and the importance of goddesses in Greece before the male Olympians. In a typical conservative reaction, Paul Shorey belittled the corybantic Hellenism of Miss Harrison and Isadora Duncan, ... the higher vaudeville Hellenism of Mr. Vachel Lindsay, the anthropological Hellenism of the disciples of Sir James Frazer, the irrational, semi-sentimental Polynesian, free-verse and sex-freedom Hellenism of all the gushful geysers of "rapturous rubbish" about the Greek Spirit.14 This linking of anthropologists with contemporary artists reveals that Harrison was seen as participating in the elaboration of Modernism in general. Payne says that the common factor which Harrison shared with her disparate sources is "the perception of passionate, non-rational structures beneath polished surfaces and rational pretensions," a "modernist pattern."15 Harrison's definitions of what art should do parallel many Modernist theories. The essays of T. S. Eliot may serve as an illustration, although he tries to distance himself from her work. Eliot is known to have read Themis (along with Frazer's The Golden Bough) for a seminar paper that he prepared at Harvard in 1913. Piers Gray has discovered the paper and reports that while Eliot appreciated Harrison's scrupulous research, he disparaged the sense which she made of her data: "of this archaeology ofthe fact Miss Harrison is one of our most proficient exponents. . . . But one has only to 10 Payne, pp. 188-89, 191. 11 Ackerman, p. 229. 12 Mary Beard, "An Eccentric Out of Context," Times Literary Supplement (27 January-2 February 1989), p. 82.

PHILLIPS open the contents table of one of her extraordinarily documented books to perceive how her 'fact' melts into interpretation, and in interpretation into metaphysics."16 Later critics usually follow Gray to emphasize Eliot's greater awareness of complexity: "his argument was that the efforts of those writers to describe religious ritual scientifically were misconceived, and could lead to no concrete results."17 Such critics act as if Harrison and Frazer insist on a single, true meaning of each rite and Eliot was the only one aware of the subjectivity and interaction of conflicting interpretations over generations. Actually, as Robert Crawford finally points out, Harrison herself recognized the "shifting manifold character" of the myths which grew up around "comparatively permanent . . . ritual."18 Eliot continued to read widely from anthropologists, and in 1920 he recommends Harrison among them: "Few books are more fascinating than those of Miss Harrison, Mr. Cornford, or Mr. Cooke, when they burrow in the origins of Greek myths and rites; M. Durkheim, with his social consciousness, and M. L^vy-Bruhl, with his Bororo Indians who convince themselves that they are parroquets, are delightful writers."19 Attracted to anthropological lore but skeptical, Eliot does not want to claim too much either for the Indians who think they are birds or for the writers who seriously record such antics: "Eliot's concern with anthropology at this time is like his concern with religion. He both finds it important and mocks it."20 But whether Eliot is genuinely praising Harrison or tempering his enthusiasm, he was nevertheless closely attuned to many of her preoccupations. Those principles discussed by Harrison and shared by Eliot include the importance of desire as a motivating force behind art; a shift from the personal desire of Romanticism to collective emotion; a need for modern artists, like ancient ritualists, to bypass or transmute their private personalities; nostalgia by artists for identifying not only with a group but with their environment, to fill their time and place completely and unself-consciously; theprimacy of "pre-presentation" over "re-presentation," reinforcing a growing conviction that concrete language creates ideas rather than illustrates preconceived ones; the need for artists to use concrete description rather than abstract labeling of an emotion in order to evoke that emotion in an audience; a wish to make artists important for a whole society, as they intuit or warn about the future; a paradoxical training for artists in both book-learned tradition and contemporary street experience; and a paradoxical production by artists of both order and a new chaotic language. Both thinkers also agreed that religion was central to human life, although Harrison began calling for a new "religion without a theology" (Epilegomena, p. xliii), whereas Eliot returned to a more orthodox Christian theology. 16 Quoted in Piers Gray, T.S. Eliot's Intellectual and Poetic Development 1909-1922 (Humanities Press, 1982), p. 141. 17 Louis Menand, DiscoveringModernism: T.S. Eliot and His Context (Oxford University Press, 1987), p. 87; cf.

She says, for example, that while hunters may have danced after a chase to commemorate successes, they were also looking to the future, acting out the captures which they wished to bring about in the next chase. The purpose of such a rite was not mainly "re-presenting" an action but "pre-presenting" it, as the dancers simultaneously discharged an emotion.21 She then takes this importance of desire, east in Freudian terms of dissatisfaction, and applies it to art: "It is out of the delay, just the space between the impulse and the reaction, that all our mental life, our images, ideas, our consciousness, our will, most of all our religion, arise" (Themis, p. 44). Harrison returns to this mediating function of art and ritual in Ancient Art: "... out of the space between an impulse and a reaction there arises an idea or representation. ... [W]hat we call an idea is, as it were, an act prefigured" (p. 53). Possibly inspired by Harrison for his own original creation, Eliot recalls her wording in "The Hollow Men" (1925) in his refrain "Between the idea / And the reality. . . Between the desire / And the spasm. . . Fails the Shadow."22 Art, however, offers the speaker little consolation, since he treats it as nothing but a shadow blocking desire from fulfilment, not leading from one to the other, as the participants in ritual had hoped. The deadened protagonists of Eliot's poem, impotent in their longing for embraces either human or divine, have put on masks like Harrison's totemic dancers: "Let me be no nearer / In death's dream kingdom / Let me also wear / Such deliberate disguises / Rat's coat, crowskin, crossed staves . . ." (p. 57). Nevertheless, in their acute ambivalence?whether they really want to merge with "Those who have crossed / With direct eyes, to death's other Kingdom" (p. 56) or hold on to their painful individuality after all?the hollow men cannot reproduce the supposedly direct sense of wholeness which their ancestors attained with one another, with spirits, or with innate power, mana. The hollow men have exacerbated the self-consciousness which Harrison detects even in the primitive dance. In totemism, she says, no distinction is felt between human and non-human, or rather, such a distinction is just dawning: "The magical ceremonies, the shedding of the human blood, the counterfeiting of the animal, have for their object to bridge the gulf that is just opening, to restore by communion that complete unity which is just becoming conscious of possible division. The ceremonies are however still intensely sympathetic and cooperative. .." (Themis, p. 125). Eliot's modern hollow men might still remember the ancient shedding of blood, with the crueifixion-like "crossed staves," and they might remember even further back to times of "bird-sanctities" (Themis, p. 110), with "crowskin." But they feel pathetically vermin-like, unempowered with animal mana, in their "Rat's coat." When Harrison points to desire as a motivating force behind "pre-presentation," she might appear to be subscribing to a Romantic expressive theory, but actually she marks 21 Jane Ellen Harrison, Ancient Art and Ritual (Holt, 1913), p. 43. Further references are noted in the text. Among Harrison's books which laid down the most discernible imprint on Modernist literature, this is probably the most important.

For both ritual and art she emphasizes collective, not private emotion (Ancient Art, p. 49). Drawing from Durkheim's insistence that the form taken by a religion always reflects the social structure of its group, she goes on to assert that the very concept of "god" arises only out of the congregated, concrete enactments of basic desires for food and fertility: They [the dancers] sink their own personality and by the wearing of masks and disguises, by dancing to a common rhythm, above all by the common excitement, they become emotionally one, a true congregation, not a collection of individuals. The emotion they feel collectively, the thing that is more than any individual emotion, they externalize, project; it is the raw-material of god-head. (Themis, pp. 45-46) Eliot offers a different version of artists who "sink their own personality" when he recommends in "Tradition and the Individual Talent" (1917), "The progress of an artist is a continual self-sacrifice, a continual extinction of personality."23 Reacting against Romanticism and against biographical criticism that reads a poem in order to ferret out a foible ofthe poet, Eliot grants that writers must have had emotions but insists that they transform them. Readers can no more deduce the personalities per se of the poets from poems than a scientist can find a catalyst in the final compound whose creation it brings about. Harrison's dancers, of course, lose their self-consciousness when they "sink their own personality" into the dancing group, whereas Eliot's ideal writer remains quite self-conscious about literary techniques. Nevertheless, Eliot agrees that too sharp an awareness of one's difference from others?and of one's pursuits and emotions as distinct from those of others?contributes to a painful fragmentation in modern life, supposedly missing from that of ancient peoples, who could join together in rituals. Eliot's desire for an "extinction of personality" through writing participates in the general reaction against alienation. Thus, when Harrison makes the group more important than the individual, she taps into a widespread change in values preceding World War I. She diagnoses that at the end of the nineteenth century, "Man rose up from the banquet of reason and law unfed. He hungered half unconsciously for the herd. It seemed an impasse: on the one side orthodoxy, tradition, authority, practical slavery; onthe other science, individual freedom, reason, and an aching loneliness."24 She follows Nietzsche in imagining some kind of "Dionysian" merging with others as a still desirable occasional goal, an escape from restraints, inhibitions, and separation, rather than a stage of totemism to be left behind forever.25 She feels at home with Nietzsche's beliefs in The Birth of Tragedy that "individuation is the root of all evil; ... art [is] the sanguine hope that the spell of individuation may yet be broken, [is] an augury of eventual reintegration."26 23 Hazard Adams, ed., Critical Theory Since Plato (Harcourt, 1971), p. 785. 24 Jane Ellen Harrison, Alpha and Omega (Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, 1915), p. 35.

Harrison identifies the absorption of Dionysian dancers?caught up in their dance, their day, their place, their god?with Henri Bergson's la duree, "duration," or intensely lived time, not clocked time. Harrison synthesizes Nietzsche's Dionysian merging with nature, Durkheim's blending with the group, and Bergson's blurring in subjective "duration," into an ideal of a thoroughly integrated life. She learned from Durkheim that "We are all of us members one of another," unified in space, and from Bergson that we are "all our past, and also the past out of which we sprang," unified in time (Alpha and Omega, p. 48). This de-emphasis of unique individuals may be said to anticipate not only Modernism but also the Poststructuralist insistence that both authors and readers are not autonomous individuals but rather creations of cultures and languages. Although Eliot's antipathy for Bergson is supposed to explain his scorn for Harrison's "metaphysics,"27 Eliot, like Harrison, hated what he called "dissociation of sensibility."28 His longed-for ^association is just la duree or participation in other terms.29 When Eliot counsels writers to look not only into the heart but also into "the cerebral cortex, the nervous system, and the digestive tracts," or to amalgamate falling in love with reading Spinoza, he resembles Harrison in her aversion to an isolated, abstract infinity and her preference for a god thoroughly rooted in instincts for sex and food.30 Eliot differs from Harrison here in that he is careful to include the cerebral cortex along with the emotions and the senses, whereas she for many years de-emphasizes reason (still using it, of course, in her rigorously researched and logically argued essays) in favor of emotion manifested in groups. It is only at the outbreak of World War I, in fact, that she detects dangerous side-effects to the "collectivism" and "purgation through primal emotions" which she has "preached" (Alpha and Omega, pp. 234, 236). She is shocked that her colleagues sign up for war "not reluctantly, but with positive alacrity. . .. Into the seething cauldron they stepped as though some healing angel, and not some devil, had troubled the waters, and the cure they found was just the bond of a common fellowship" (Alpha and Omega, pp. 228,231). Whereas she earlier had thought that "the gregarious, or, as sociologists pleasantly term it, the 'herd' instinct" could find safe outlets in "Peace Societies, in Socialism, even in Strikes, in each and every form of human Co-operation," she now castigates the dangerous side of "the small, combative herd-emotions" (Alpha and Omega, pp. 88, 71, 238). She regrets "how soon?how almost inevitably?a noble collectivism passes over into an ignoble imperialism" (Alpha and Omega, p. 245). If Harrison has to modify her enthusiasm for the collectivism of dance, she finds 27 Gray, p. 141. 28 T.S. Eliot, "The Metaphysical Poets," in Richard Ellmann and Charles Feidelson, eds., The Modern Tradition: Backgrounds of Modern Literature (Oxford University Press, 1965), p. 95. 29 For Eliot's "dissociation of sensibility" and Levy-Bruhl's "participation," see Marc Manganaro, "Dissociation in 'Dead Land': The Primitive Mind in the Early Poetry of T.S.

PHILLIPS other values in arts that begin with concrete enactment rather than abstraction. She believes that a dancer who tries to give a model to nature?leaping as high as she wants the flax to grow?produces the idea of a daimon and eventually the idea of a god. This notion of concrete dancer preceding abstract god is another instance of Harrison's break with a Romantic expressive theory. Art and ritual do not express pre-existing ideas but actually produce them: "... the leader does not 'embody' a previously conceived idea, rather he begets it. ... The abstract idea arises from the only thing it possibly can arise from, the concrete fact. Without perception there is no conception" (Ancient Art, p. 71). Calling Max Muller's definition of religion as an individual's longing for "the infinite" "unreal to the point of grotesqueness," she instead traces religion to a group's longing for "Witchetty Grubs," food (Themis, pp. 488-89, 125). In the second edition of Themis (1927), Harrison claims that her inference that dance and daimon spawn the gods themselves was one of her "heresies" originally greeted as "rash" but later accepted "almost as postulates" (Themis, p. 539). By means of this "postulate," Harrison influenced literary critics as well as anthropologists. In stressing the primacy of concrete form over abstract idea, she reinforced a growing theory of the "constitutive" power of art to shape our perceptions. As W. H. Auden asks, "How can I know what I think till I see what I say?"31 After insisting that the particular rite and the particular utterance suggest to both participants and audience outlooks which they had not formulated previously, Harrison further asks artists to prepare emotion in an audience by a constant return to concrete particulars: "We must not only utter emotion, we must represent it, that is, we must in some way reproduce or imitate or express the thought which is causing us emotion" (Ancient Art, p. 34). Eliot recalls this advice not to name an emotion but actually to recreate it, in "Hamlet" (1919): "The only way of expressing emotion in the form of art is by finding an 'objective correlative'; in other words, a set of objects, a situation, a chain of events which shall be the formula of That particular emotion; such that when the external facts, which must terminate in sensory experience, are given, the emotion is immediately evoked."32 Harrison's advice to reproduce on the page whatever it was that caused an emotion rather than merely to name it became an ideal not only in poetry (as in Ezra Pound's Imagism), but is also reflected, however indirectly, in Ernest Hemingway's "iceberg" theory: I was trying to write then and I found the greatest difficulty, aside from knowing truly what you really felt, rather than what you were supposed to feel, and had been taught to feel, was to put down what really happened in action; what the actual things were which produced the emotion that you experienced, ... the real thing, the sequence of motion and fact which made the emotion. . . .33 Although Harrison differentiates between concrete ritual and concrete art by saying that ritual is "mediate" (a means to an end, to more grubs, more emus, more children), while art is "//wmediate," she maintains a typically twentieth-century ambivalence 31 Adams, pp. 726, 993. 32 Ellmann and Feidelson, p. 134. 33 Ernest Hemingway, Death in the Afternoon (Scribner's, 1960), p. 2.</page><page sequence="9">JANE HARRISON AND MODERNISM 473 between expecting art to be an "end ... in itself" and still expecting it to perform certain psychological and social transformations, which are themselves almost magical in their reach (Ancient Art, p. 135). She credits artists with intuiting social currents and even with accomplishing such mediating functions as lay ing down channels for new ideas: "a poet will forecast dimly what a later discovery will confirm" (Ancient Art, p. 240). Ezra Pound similarly assigns artists the role of forecasting and warning, as they become the "antennae of the race."34 Eliot, like his protagonists in The Waste Land, hopes to communicate his urgent message of changes needed in society not directly but through "These fragments I have shored against my ruins."35 One way in which artists might attune themselves, as antennae, to the current of their time is to bring modern life onto the page. For Harrison, modern art has to derive from "a keen emotion felt towards things and people living to-day, in modern conditions, including, among other and deeper forms of life, the haste and hurry ofthe modern street, the whirr of motor cars and aeroplanes" (Ancient Art, p. 237). But at the same time that Harrison sends artists down into the street, she wants them to remember that they are "heirs to the ages," as Eliot similarly invites Western artists to become aware of the "simultaneous existence" of "the whole ofthe literature of Europe from Homer."36 In fact, Harrison recommends two paradoxical combinations which became central to Modernism. First, she recommends that writers bring modern life onto the page while remembering tradition; the paradox is novelty with tradition. Second, she advocates that they transcribe chaos into new and difficult language while imposing order; the paradox here is chaos with order. Harrison says, in 1913: Modern life is not simple?cannot be simple?ought not to be; it is not for nothing that we are heirs to the ages. Therefore the art that utters and expresses our emotion towards modern life cannot be simple; and, moreover, it must before all things embody not only that living tangle which is felt by the Futurists as so real, but it must purge and order it, by complexities of tone and rhythm hitherto unattempted. (Ancient Art, p. 233) This passage appears to anticipate Eliot's more famous lines in "The Metaphysical Poets" (1921): . . . poets in our civilization, as it exists at present, must be difficult. Our civilization comprehends great variety and complexity, and this variety and complexity, playing upon a refined sensibility, must produce various and complex results. The poet must become more and more comprehensive, more allusive, more indirect, in order to force, to dislocate if necessary, language into his meaning.37 34 Ezra Pound, "The Teacher's Mission" (1934), Literary Essays ofEzra Pound, ed. with an introduction by T.S. Eliot (Faber &amp; Faber, 1954), p. 58. 35 Eliot, Poems, p. 50; see Payne, pp. 191-92, for the ritual theory of drama and Eliot's "own ritual dramas, such as Murder in the Cathedral." 36 T.S.

PHILLIPS Harrison spells out yet another paradoxical combination of "tangle" and "order." Eliot in "Ulysses, Order, and Myth" (1923) shares her belief by asking artists to include both "anarchy" and "shape" in their art: In using the myth, in manipulating a continuous parallel between contemporaneity and antiquity, Mr. Joyce is pursuing a method which others must pursue after him. They will not be imitators, any more than the scientist who uses the discoveries of an Einstein in pursuing his own, independent, further investigations. It is simply a way of controlling, of ordering, of giving a shape and a significance to the immense panorama of futility and anarchy which is contemporary history. . . . Psychology . . . ethnology, and The Golden Bough have concurred to make possible what was impossible even a few years ago. Instead of narrative method, we may now use the mythical method. It is, I seriously believe, a step toward making the modern world possible for art, toward that order and form which Mr. Aldington so earnestly desires [Aldington had called Joyce a "great undisciplined talent"].38 Harrison's "living tangle" purged by "order" forecasts Eliot's "anarchy" given "form" by the "mythical method," a union which to some has seemed the essence of Modernism. If Harrison anticipates the Modernists in such tenets as the importance of concrete description over abstract naming and the necessity to reflect chaotic street experience by chaotic language while still ordering it by structure, she sounds very different from them when she starts calling in Epilegomena (written in her seventies) for a new asceticism (lii-lv). By contrast (at least at first sight), one of the reasons why such Modernists as Lawrence and Faulkner were attracted to early twentieth-century anthropology was the frank sexuality of its stories. Harrison seems to part company from these writers in their need to break away from Victorian repressions. But if she envisions an almost medieval ascetic community life, she does so not because she condemns sexuality or wants to substitute heaven for earth in her version of a new religion. Instead, she has been consistently bringing the gods down to earth, to the witchetty grubs, all along. She has also been celebrating sexuality all along. She says, in 1915, "We acknowledge now that desire is at the root of all our values and emotions, so we no longer scorn and crucify the flesh" (Alpha and Omega, p. 141). Sex is present in every subject: "Anyone who makes even a very small mental discovery can note how, at the moment of the making, there is a sudden sense of warmth, an uprush of emotion, often a hot blush, and sometimes tears in the eyes. Who can say that a process so sensuous and emotional, or at least attended by concomitants so sensuous, is insulated from a thing as interpenetrating as sex?" (Alpha and Omega, pp. 140-41). Shared sexuality in her time, however, also often meant pregnancy. Harrison writes, "Is woman to live life to the full, or is her function only to hand on life? If she is to live it to the full, there is for her as for him only one solution. Sex must not be ignored or atrophied, still less must it, by a sort of mental jugglery, be at one and the same moment ignored and over-emphasized" (Alpha and Omega, pp. 110- 11). She wants to balance the intensely in-turned emotion of a couple caught up in their private sexuality with out-going sentiments: the drive for knowledge (more higher education for women) and concern for the whole community (more political participation for women).

Even Lawrence's new version of marriage that supposedly unlocked women's potential might be seen as part of "a general upsurge in male insecurity" after World War I, when women moved in greater numbers into the work force and the voting booth: "[Lawrence] believed that the dominant ideology ofthe post-war world was feminine?not, however, a true femininity of instinct and feeling, but a perverted femininity of will and idealism?and that a masculine renaissance was necessary to restore the balance."40 He was certain, for example, that if "cocksure women" were nervous and irritable, they needed not a wider range of jobs, as they claimed, but a man and children. Women would never be satisfied, he thought, having "laid a vote" or an "ink-bottle."41 Harrison, on the contrary, wanted access to the ink, as well as to companionship and respect: "Marriage, for a woman at least, hampers the two things that made life to me glorious?friendship and learning. ... I think, as civilisation advances, family life will become, if not extinct, at least much modified and curtailed" (Reminiscences, pp. 88-89). The community that she imagines would make better use of economic resources than single-family residences, she argues, and better use of women's talents. The society that sponsored such communal arrangements would be held together by religious belief: not belief in a god, but rather belief in the group itself as divine. Although she hated her stepmother's Evangelicalism, Harrison grudgingly recognized that its Conversion bore a resemblance to the New Birth of the ancient initiation ceremonies which she admired, in which "the individual spirit is socialized." Both were intense emotional experiences, and both, she insisted, were really a conversion "not to God, but to your fellow-man" (Alpha and Omega, pp. 65, 79). The social group and one's own emotion were her gods. In a prediction borne out by literary Modernism, she wrote in 1921, "it is [again] possible to have a living and vigorous religion without a theology" (Epilegomena, p. xliii). Although Eliot would agree with Harrison that religion is "a function of our human nature," he turned from his early studies in primitive mythology to an orthodox Christianity, whereas she felt that religion could include rites addressed to no god, with no priest and no church (Epilegomena, pp. xxi, xx). But if Harrison parts company with Eliot here, she was in tune with a spiritual quest that animated the return of many Modernists to ancient dying gods: Forster to Adonis and 39 Jane Ellen Harrison, Reminiscences of a Student's Life (Hogarth, 1925), p. 88. Harrison's biographer keeps insisting that the "real root" of her single status lies in "fury [at age five and ever afterward] at her father and stepmother for creating a circle that she felt excluded her" (Peacock, p. 15). This Freudian habit of reducing all lives to the family circle prevents attention to the larger social picture: what the institution of marriage was in Harrison's time. 40 Hilary Simpson, D.H.

PHILLIPS Krishna, Hemingway to Attis and Cybele, Lawrence to Quetzalcoatl and Isis, and so on.42 The anthropomorphic dying gods popularized by anthropologists such as Harrison and Frazer appealed to modern artists not because most of them believed in a literal human-like god present somewhere in the universe, but because they were searching for the god-like features in the human. Instead of a traditional morality, such "godliness" included awe at life, respect for sexuality, commitment to society, acceptance of death, and enough equanimity to work in the world without despair. The importance which Harrison placed on "a god who is immanent, not imminent" also had resonances for her conception of the human self. "The notion of the external God who was Creator or Ruler or Judge or Proprietor was the reflection of a time when man was very sure of his own selfhood and separateness, when lines were sharply drawn and selves were envisaged as solid bodies in space mutually exclusive, not as forces interacting" (Alpha and Omega, p. 195). She traces this concept of an individuality that emerges only at the "cross-roads" of "many temporary associations" to William James' Psychology: "I had felt so sure of the solid existence of one thing at least, of myself, and suddenly I seemed to go to pieces, to lapse into a stream of consciousness, an ill-defmed compound, or tendency, partly myself, partly other people" (Alpha and Omega, pp. 38, 44-45). Harrison shared this concept of unbound personality with several twentieth-century novelists. Woolf, for example, has Mrs. Dalloway think that she is "part of people she had never met; being laid out like a mist between the people she knew best, who lifted her on their branches as she had seen the trees lift the mist, but it spread ever so far, her life, herself."43 Woolf's characters in The Years are similarly asking, "Are we one, or are we separate. . . . What's 'I?'"44 Harrison thus participated in many important ideas of her time, such as the shifts from reason to emotion and from a distinct individual to a fluid self which strove to be united with a group. She helped to formulate the primacy in art of concrete form for creating abstract ideas, the paradox of ancient tradition with contemporary street experience, and a combination of tangle and order. She further recognized that modern artists would return to myths not just to provide structural patterns but as part of a spiritual search for a new religion without a theology. Because of her acute awareness of the currents of her age and her accurate predictions of the art that would come after her(in the works of Eliot, Woolf, and others) Harrison could well be represented in anthologies and classes as one of the key background forces of modern literature. 42 See also Phillips, pp. 218-20. 43 Virginia Woolf, Mrs. Dalloway (Harcourt, 1981), p. 9. 44 Virginia Woolf, The Years (Harcourt, 1965), p. 140.</page></plain_text>
