<plain_text><page sequence="1">INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP HOARDING IN RATS By G. A. MILLER and LEO POSTMAN, Harvard University Many psychologists who have had experience with the care and feeding of a rat colony have noticed the rat's tendency to carry food about, or to pile it in a corner of the home cage.' It was not until 1939, however, that an attempt was made to quantify such behavior and to study it experimentally. In that year Hunt and Willoughby suggested that hoarding might be used as an index of frustration,2 and Wolfe published an exploratory study of the general factors conditioning hoarding behavior.3 Since then three aspects of the hoarding problem have received especial attention: the r6le of frus- tration in the hoarding response, the physiological state of the hoard- ing animal, and the environmental conditions which modify the behavior. Frustration. If the fundamental frustration-food deprivation-is care- fully controlled, it should be possible to introduce other frustrations and to study their effects upon the hoarding response. Thus, for example, Hunt and Willoughby placed food pellets in a clip in the corner of the rat's cage and counted the number of pellets which the rat removed and piled up inside the cage. In the regular feeding period, one group of rats was allowed to eat all the food presented, while the other was given a large supply and then 'frustrated' by seeing most of the food removed. The feeding frustration did not, however, affect the rat's behavior during the hoarding trial. McCord later repeated this experiment with a more severe frustration produced by placing the surplus food where it was perceived but was not accessible to the rats.4 With this technique McCord obtained * Accepted for publication June 25, 1946. 1 See, for example, J. A. Hamilton and E. L. Ballachey, An instance of Umweg behavior in the rat, J. Genet. Psychol., 45, 1934, 260-261. The authors secured moving pictures of a female rat transporting a 150-grm. tin of food over a 12-in. barrier in order to eat the food in a less exposed area. SJ. McV. Hunt and R. R.

Hunt meanwhile followed his earlier work with a second paper which aroused considerable interest.5 In this experiment the frustration was produced by food deprivation in infancy. The apparent indication that, as adults, the previously frustrated rats hoarded more pellets than the control animals supports the very reasonable belief that infantile frustra- tions affect adult behavior. Food deprivation. Wolfe, in 1939, reported experiments exploring the possibility of quantifying hoarding behavior, the effects of previous ex- perience with the pellet type of food, and the consequences of an inade- quate diet." He used a narrow passageway to connect the rat's home cage to a bin of food pellets, and counted the number of pellets carried into the cage during each trial. In this way he determined that familiarity with pellets facilitates pellet carrying, and that hunger and inadequate diet are the most significant factors in eliciting hoarding. This work was followed by an important series of experiments by Morgan and Stellar which demonstrated the fundamental character of food deprivation.' The rat's hoarding depends primarily upon his feeding history; other factors such as previous experience, lighting, length of alleys, and temperature,8 are secondary in their effects. The general picture of the hoarding mechanism suggested by this work is of a physiological deficit built up by food deprivation and manifested in two antagonistic drives: hunger and hoarding. The goal of the hoarding drive seems to be the hoarding activity itself, rather than any insightful accumulation of food to forestall anticipated deprivation.9 5 J. McV.

A. McCleary and C. T. Morgan, Food-hoarding in rats as a function of environmental temperature (in preparation). SThis hypothesis, first suggested by Morgan, Stellar, and Johnson, op. cit., 284 f., was later supported by results reported by G. A. Miller, Concerning the goal of hoarding behavior in the rat, J. Comp. Psychol., 38, 1945, 209-212. Dr. J. S. Bruner has suggested that such a conclusion may be valid only for laboratory rats accustomed to "automatic" feeding. Our experience with wild rats, however, is that the experimental situation causes strong emotional reactions which obscure the hoarding. Since, therefore, only laboratory rats can be used in laboratory tests, the answer seems indeterminate.</page><page sequence="3">654 MILLER AND POSTMAN Apparently the deficit crosses some 'all-or-none' threshold, because the onset of hoarding in any individual is usually very abrupt. When hoarding behavior begins, the animal appears to be in conflict between eating and hoarding, and alternates between them. Following long periods of de- privation, hoarding will continue for several days after the rats are satiated. Stellar later attempted, with little success, to establish more specifically the nature of the postulated deficit, but he points out that his results are not conclusive and recommends further investigation.'0 Familiarity. Stimulated by the work of Morgan and his students, Viek and Miller undertook a series of experiments designed to explore the secondary factor of familiarity." Wolfe had demonstrated that familiarity with the pellets was important, and Stellar and Morgan had observed the effect of familiarity with the alleys. Both of these observations were verified and expanded. Most important, however, is the rat's familiarity with the cage. If the cage is strange, no hoarding occurs. The results indicated that this perception is mainly olfactory, secondarily visual. It should be noted, however, that none of these studies was concerned with possible social factors in the hoarding response. Wolfe used groups of litter mates hoarding from the same food bin to a common cage, but he did not report what effects such grouping produced. Consequently, the possibility that groups of rats might behave quite differently from isolated rats remains to be explored. The food-storing activities of the social in- sects, for example, are of central importance in their communal life and, in the absence of knowledge to the contrary, it is conceivable that analogous social effects might be elicited with groups of rats. The present study is exploratory, designed to investigate the effects of a group-hoarding situation, and to provide a basis for possible future work with the problem. Experiment I includes the main body of data gathered in 1944 by the authors. Fortunately, additional data became available when Dr. Thelma Alper and the junior author (Experiment II) repeated certain portions of the experiment as a class project for their course in experimental psychology.2 While the primary reliance will be placed on the results of Experiment I, the 10E.

METHOD Apparatus and procedure. The hoarding apparatus consisted of a square enclosure, 46 in, to the side and 10 in. high. There was an opening for a cage on every side, and the top was covered with wire mesh, which could be lifted for removing the rats at the end of the trial. The food- pellets were placed in a large circular bin in the center, 20 in. from the cage doors. Constant artificial illumination was provided by a light 3 ft. directly above the food-bin. The rats were between 5 and 6 mo. of age at the beginning of the experiment. Prior to this time they had lived, together with 8 or 10 other rats, in one of the large cages used to house the colony. The rats had been placed in this cage immediately after weaning, and an ample supply of pellet-food was available at all times through the openings in a wire- mesh food-container at the end of the cage. Thus the rats had experienced no deliberate food-deprivation before they fell into the hands of the Es. The rats were selected at random from the large cage, and placed in individual cages 24 hr. before the first hoarding trial. During this period no food was available to them until one-half hour before the trial. On the succeeding days of the experiment the animals were allowed a 30-min. feeding period in their cages 12 hr. before and again immediately before the hoarding-trial. This feeding, plus the food ingested during the hoarding-trial itself, corresponded to somewhat less than half their normal daily food-intake. Experiment I. Experiment I continued with a single 30-min. hoarding- trial each day for a period of 52 days. This total time was divided into six experimental conditions: (1) The first period of the experiment, comprising the first 10 days, was used to introduce the 8 male rats to the experimental situation and to give the rats time to begin hoarding. During this period the rats hoarded alone from the central bin, and the other three apertures in the apparatus were blocked off. Each rat was assigned a particular aperture in which its cage was placed on every trial, and this assignment was retained throughout the entire experiment. (2) At the end of 10 days of hoarding in isolation, the animals were divided into 2 groups of 4 rats each. The cages were placed in the apertures of the hoarding-apparatus, and the rats were permitted to hoard together in groups of 4. This condition was continued for 11 trials. (3) On the basis of results obtained in condition 2, the rats were re- grouped and the group hoarding-trials continued in the same manner for 10 more days.</page><page sequence="5">656 MILLER AND POSTMAN (4) The grouping established for Condition 3 was retained for Condi- tion 4. Under Condition 4, however, the central food-bin was removed, and 20 pellets were placed in each of the 4 cages at the beginning of the hoarding-trials. This continued for 5 days. (5) On the thirty-seventh day of the experiment the group situation was abandoned, and the rats were returned to hoarding in isolation, as in Con- dition 1, for 11 days. (6) The final 5 days of the experiment consisted of individual hoarding in isolation, but, in addition to the central food-bin, the other apertures contained cages which were opened and which held pellets to be hoarded. For convenience, these six experimental conditions will be referred to as simply Condition 1, Condition 2, etc. Experiment II. In Experiment II, when the investigation was repeated, 8 female rats were used, and the experimental conditions corresponded to Conditions 1, 2, 3 and 5 in Experiment I. The rats hoarded alone for 12 days under Condition 1. On the thirteenth day they began hoarding in 2 groups of 4 rats each, and after 7 trials they were regrouped for Con- dition 3. At the end of 5 trials with the new grouping, the rats were returned to hoading alone for 5 more days. The regrouping in this case necessitated a reassignment of apertures to the different rats. In all other respects, the experimental apparatus and procedure were identical for both experiments. RESULTS Experiment I. The experimental results are given in Table I, and are summarized graphically in Fig. 1, for Experiment I. The data for Condition 1 show that the first 10 days of the experiment were sufficient to establish the hoarding-response in 6 of the 8 rats, and the average for the 8 Ss reached a level of about 30 pellets per half- hour trial. On the 11th day Rats 1, 2, 3 and 4 began hoarding together in one group, while Rats 5, 6, 7 and 8 comprised a second group. On the very first trial under group-conditions a type of hoarding appeared which the Es had not foreseen, and which necessitated the compilation of 2 hoarding-scores for each rat. In addition to taking pellets from the central food-bin, some of the rats invaded the cages of their companions and proceeded to remove pellets from there. Thus a single pellet might be carried into several different cages during the period of hoarding. Consequently, records were kept of each time a rat carried a pellet from the bin to a cage (bin-hoarding) and also</page><page sequence="6">INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP HOARDING IN RATS 657 of each time a rat carried a pellet from one cage to another (intercage- hoarding).

This difference</page><page sequence="7">658 MILLER AND POSTMAN decreased progressively as the rats abandoned the position preference in the later stages of the experiment. In general, the rats whose hoard was stolen by an intercage-hoarder showed no particular interest in their loss. The only exception arose when an intercage-hoarder, after removing all other pellets from the cage, attempted to take the last pellet out of the victim's mouth.

In general, the rats tended to carry the pellets back to their own cages. This behavior, however, was not invariable, for sometimes two rats would begin placing pellets in the same cage. The Es felt that the uncommonness of such 'coaperative' hoarding was due primarily to the rats' getting in each other's way and interfering with each other's freedom of movement. Examination of Table I shows that the rats differed in their tendency</page><page sequence="8">INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP HOARDING IN RATS 659 to hoard from the bin or from the other cages. For the entire period of 11 days, approximately two-thirds (66%) of the pellets hoarded were taken from the central bin. If we consider only Rats 2, 3, 5 and 8, however, 89% of their hoarding was done from the bin, while Rats 1, 4, 6 and 7 hoarded 45% of their pellets from the bin. The question naturally arose as to whether this 'division of labor' 100 . 8 0 __ __ __ __ __ o O Q5 2 5 I 6 O 75"---- --- 1 m 50 -- 0 0 w CONDITION 2 CONDITION 3 CONDITION 6 I00 C-- 9 - --- 14 .....--- 0 __ __ _ 4 0 75 I "-1r'"" ~ 1 Z I1 V 9 16 it: 50... . ..

Consequently, the rats were regrouped under Condi- tion 3 so the bin-hoarders (Rats 2, 3, 5 and 8) worked together in one group and the intercage-hoarders (Rats 1, 4, 6 and 7) in the other. Under this arrangement the amount of bin-hoarding dropped slightly to 63% of the total. The bin-hoarders as a group, however, hoarded 77% of their pellets from the central bin, and the intercage- hoarders 51%.</page><page sequence="9">660 MILLER AND POSTMAN The percentage of bin-hoarding done by each rat is shown in the block diagram of Fig. 2 A, where the light bars indicate the per- centages for rats that were judged, on the basis of Condition 2, to be bin-hoarders, and the dark bars indicate the intercage-hoarders. In the new grouping, Rat 7 changed from intercage-hoarding to bin- hoarding, and Rat 3 changed from bin-hoarding to intercage-hoarding. For Condition 4, the central food-bin was removed, and 20 pellets were placed in each cage at the beginning of the trial. Low scores during these trials reflect the fact that only 80 pellets were available. On the first exposure to this condition, the persistent bin-hoarders (notably Rats 2 and 5) ran from their cages to the center of the en- closure in their usual manner. Upon reaching the center, they stopped abruptly, sniffed several times at the floor of the apparatus, and then began general exploratory activity. This continued for only a short time, however, before they began to hoard from the other cages. At the end of 5 trials, the bin-hoarders were hoarding more pellets from the cages than were the intercage-hoarders. The rank-difference correlation between the bin-hoarding preferences in Conditions 2 and 3, and the number of pellets hoarded from the cages under Con- dition 4, is -0.39. Thus there is no evidence that the bin-hoarders were inhibited by the removal of the bin. At the end of Condition 3, rat 8 died of inanition and was replaced during Condition 4 by another animal. The new rat was much larger and heavier than the experimental animals which had been on a deprivation diet for more than a month. Nonetheless, its appearance was greeted by intensely aggressive behavior, led primarily by Rat 3. The intruder became extremely submissive, and was frightened back into its cage on every approach toward the food-bin. On the thirty-seventh trial the rats again hoarded alone from the central bin, and the average amount of hoarding was approximately the same as at the end of Condition 1. There was some indication that Rat 4, the most persistent intercage-hoarder, was disturbed by being forced to hoard from the central bin. During the first few trials under these conditions, he carried pellets around at random, occa- sionally piling them up in one corner of the enclosure. When, in Condition 6, the individual rats were permitted to hoard from either the bin or the cages, the average number of pellets hoarded</page><page sequence="10">INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP HOARDING IN RATS 661 jumped to almost 2 pellets per minute per rat, and remained high throughout the 5 trials. It was as if their hoarding under Conditions 4 and 5 were simply added together. During Condition 6 it was apparent that the original position habits had disappeared, and 49.5 % of the pellets hoarded were taken from the central bin. The per- centage of bin-hoarding for each rat is shown in Fig. 2 A.

Experiment II. The repeat experiment duplicated only Conditions 1, 2, 3 and 5 of the experiment reported above. Results are presented in Table II and in Fig. 3. These data show a very abrupt drop in the mean number of pellets hoarded when the rats began hoarding in groups. The extent of this decrement is somewhat exaggerated by the excessive activity of Rat 15, which began during the last 15 min. of the tenth trial and extended through most of the twelfth trial. This flurry had apparently spent itself, and the mean would probably have fallen in any case on</page><page sequence="11">662 MILLER AND POSTMAN the thirteenth trial. A more important factor, however, was the ex- ploratory behavior which the presence of the other animals and the other cages elicited. A sharp drop in the hoarding-scores would be expected from previous studies of the rat's familiarity with the hoard- ing situation, but such a drop was not observed in Experiment I.

MEAN NUMBER OF PELLETS HOARDED BY THE RATS IN EXPERIMENT II Experiment II. Examination of Fig. 2 B, which gives the percentage of pellets taken from the central bin, reveals a distinctly bimodal dis- tribution. Rats 9, 14, 15 and 16 hoarded 93%o of their pellets from the central food-bin, while Rats 10, 11, 12 and 13 took only 26%o of their pellets from the bin. When the rats were regrouped as bin- hoarders and intercage-hoarders, Rats 11 and 13 reversed their previous performances and began hoarding from the bin. The progressive decline of the position preference noted in Experi- ment I is also apparent in Experiment II. The preference may have</page><page sequence="12">INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP HOARDING IN RATS 663 been abandoned more rapidly in the second experiment because the regrouping necessitated shifting the apertures assigned to each rat. DISCUSSION If the results of these experiments are considered in the light of their contribution to our understanding of social processes in animals, the prospect is not encouraging. In this respect the data are typical of the majority of studies done with groups of rats, and lend support to the general conclusion that the behavior of the rat is not a fertile field for the social psychologist.'3 One of the rat's main recommendations to the experimenter in, say, learning or motivation, is the experimental simplification which is possible. In the social situation, however, this simplicity is less of a virtue. If one considers the ways in which one rat must depend upon another, the list seems to end with the maternal drive and the sex drive. It is, of course, possible to manipulate the environmental conditions in such a way that one rat is necessarily dependent upon another,'4 but even here the rat's paucity of symbolic processes taxes the manipulator's ingenuity. Although summary state- ments must be suspect, it seems fair to say that any Umweg aspects involving coiperation with other rats are very difficult for the animal to master. Thus, in the present experiment, there is little indication that throwing the rats together in a group situation has any profound effect upon their behavior. There was, of course, a certain amount of exploratory behavior, but this was directed as much toward the new cages as toward the new animals.'5 There is some evidence also (Experiment II) that the introduction of other rats decreases the 1 See, for example, A.

Similar effects have been obtained, however, when unfamiliar aspects are introduced with rats hoarding in isola- tion. The various types of social interaction which might conceivably have occurred did not appear.

Social facilitation was certainly not observed, nor was there any evidence of imitation. With the exception of the naive rat intro- duced on the thirty-second trial of Experiment I, there was little evidence that dominance or competition were at work. In one respect, however, the hoarding-behavior of the other rats did modify and condition the hoarding of the individual. Intercage- hoarding, as it occurred in Conditions 2 and 3, was contingent upon</page><page sequence="14">INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP HOARDING IN RATS 665 prior bin-hoarding by other rats, and in a sense the intercage-hoarders were dependent upon the bin-hoarders. This fact is demonstrated in Fig. 4, where the amount of bin-hoarding and intercage-hoarding (during Condition 3 of Experiment I) is plotted as a function of successivt 5-min. periods during the half-hour's trial. During the first 5 min. practically no pellets were removed from the other cages, for the very good reason that practically no pellets were in the other cages. As the period progresses, however, and pellets are brought from the central bin, the intercage-hoarding increases until it nearly equals the amount of bin-hoarding. It seems reasonable to suppose, therefore, that at least one rat in every group must hoard from the central food-bin. Examination of Fig. 2 shows that this was the case. When the intercage-hoarders were grouped together in Condition 3, a 'social problem' developed,le and it was necessary for one or two rats to change from intercage to bin- hoarding. That is, of course, just what happened. The possibility should also be noted that the bimodality observed in the distribution of the bin-hoarding percentages for Condition 2 may be the result of the interaction between the rats. Unfortunately, however, the present data neither support nor oppose such an inter- pretation, and further investigation is indicated. Whether or not such behavior is to be classified as social is a semantic problem. The results, both quantitative and qualitative, indi- cated a minimum of interaction between the animals, and the effects which were observed seem more attributable to the nature of the environmental situation than to the social propensities of the animal. At least one further point should be discussed for its general relevance to a theory of hoarding-behavior. The common sense view of hoarding-behavior might lead to the anthropomorphic conclusion that the rat hoards today in order to eat tomorrow. His 'purpose' is to accumulate enough food in the home cage to last through the present period of deprivation, and, since this foresightful behavior takes time which could otherwise be spent in eating, one might expect the rat to accumulate a satisfactory supply as quickly and economically 1SCf.

Unfortunately, however, this interpretation encounters a number of serious difficulties. In the first place, such foresight is un- precedented for the rat, and, secondly, experimental attempts to evalu- ate the hypothesis have not supported it.' If the hypothesis is applied to the present data, one is immediately impressed by the flagrant violation of any principle of least effort or least action. The position of a given cage with respect to the central bin and the other cages was such that the bin was 20 in. from the cage door, while the distance to the other cages was 30 in. diagonally or 50 in. directly across the apparatus. Otherwise bin and cages were comparable; a 2-in. barrier existed both at the food bin and at the entrance of the cages. In such a situation the shortest and quickest path to food is that leading to the central bin. Thus, when a rat deliberately detours around the bin in order to travel more than twice as far to obtain a pellet of food, it is not in harmony with the rat's known tendency to take the shortest path to the goal. An alternative hypothesis, proposed by Morgan, Stellar, and Johnson,'" suggests that the goal of hoarding is hoarding activity itself, rather than the result of such activity.19 This hypothesis does not involve any implicit assumptions about the distance the animal might travel,20 and it seems to account for the apathy of the rats whose hoard was stolen by intercage hoarders. If the hypothesis is correct- and it accords well with the findings of these and other experiments -there results a rather interesting problem for the dynamic theorist. In most situations motivating conditions lead to activity which re- duces or eliminates the source of motivation. Thus food deprivation leads to food-seeking and food-eating behavior, and the deficit is alleviated. This pattern is easily recognized and conveniently described " Miller, op. cit., footnote 9. * Op. cit., footnote 7. ~ Rat 15 on the eleventh trial of Experiment II, for example, accumulated 178 pellets in the cage in 30 min. At the end of the trial there was scarcely room left in the cage for the animal itself, and yet there was no indication of any diminution of the behavior. This hoard alone would have been sufficient for a normal diet for all 8 rats for more than a week, and represents a distance travelled between cage and bin of about an eighth of a mile. s? It is possible that some optimal distance exists, and that short distances may not provide adequate scope for the pattern. The experimental test of this possibility would be relatively straightforward.</page><page sequence="16">INDIVIDUAL AND GitOUP HOARDING IN RATS 667 in terms of beginning-state, activity, and end-state. Hoarding-behavior in the laboratory situation, however, offers an instance where the activity persists even though it does not eliminate the activating condi- tions. Insofar as hoarding interferes with eating, it tends to perpetuate the deficit condition. There is a beginning-state and a period of activity, but the activity does not lead directly to drive reduction in the sense often implied in connection with the principle of effect. These difficulties would, of course, be eliminated if it could be shown that hoarding is primarily an acquired response, and that it satisfies some more basic motivating condition. At the present time the evidence needed to elaborate this notion is not available, although a suggestive experiment has been done by Mowrer.21 Four hungry rats were placed in competition for a single pellet of food. The rat which captured the food was permitted to escape into an adjacent compartment, and a door closed to permit the rat to eat in undisturbed isolation. When this response had been established, the other three rats were removed. The single rat persisted in carry food into the adjacent compartment and, if given the opportunity, would accumu- late there a hoard of pellets. This evidence indicates that, under proper conditions, hoarding may appear as a learned response. Unfortu- n;tely, however, this work has not been followed up, and the relation between the behavior of Mowrer's rats and of those in the more usual hoarding situation cannot at present be stated. In addition to the r61e of learning in eliciting hoarding, a number of problems suggested themselves in connection with the present work. Some of these can be briefly catalogued: (1) Will hoarding by groups of rats appear in the absence of prior hoarding experience in isolation? (2) What is the effect of using groups of different sizes? (3) What is the response in isolation to a hoarding situation in- volving more than one source of food? Do position preferences develop? (4) Will hoarding persist in the group situation when the rats are satiated? (5) What is the effect of prior living conditions upon the rat's 1 O. H. Mowrer, Animal studies in the social modification of organically moti- vated behavior, 1939, film.</page><page sequence="17">668 MILLER AND POSTMAN response to the group situation? Do rats raised in isolation differ from rats raised in a common cage? (6) Can the behavior be modified by employing groups of rats in which certain social relations (e.g. a dominance hierarchy) have been previously established? Does the rat's preference for bin- or intercage-hoarding depend in any way upon such relations? This is not a complete list, but it indicates some of the directions in which future experimentation on hoarding-behavior might profitably expand. Like most exploratory studies, the present work seems to suggest as many problems as it settles. SUMMARY When four rats were allowed to hoard simultaneously from the same bin, some rats showed a preference for hoarding from the central bin, while others hoarded more from the cages of the other rats. Intercage- hoarding by one rat depended upon prior bin-hoarding by the others, and when intercage-hoarders were grouped together some of the rats reversed their preference and began hoarding from the central bin. To this extent the hoarding behavior of the individual was socially conditioned by the behavior of the other members of the group. The occurrence of intercage, hoarding and the lack of resistance by the rats whose hoards were stolen are interpreted as evidence supporting the hypothesis that the goal of hoard. ing behavior is the hoarding activity itself, rather than the results of such activity.</page></plain_text>
