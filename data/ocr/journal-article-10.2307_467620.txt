<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Rogue's Progress: Journeys of the Picaro from Oral Tradition to Contemporary Chicano Literature of New Mexico Enrique R. Lamadrid University of New Mexico The Indo-Hispanic oral tradition of New Mexico is richly populat- ed with tricksters, from old Coyote, whose presence dates to the dawn of human consciousness in North America, to the picaros, those human-faced rogues who arrived with Iberian immigrants in the val- ley of the Rio Grande. With the eclipse and modification of oral nar- rative traditions in the latter twentieth century, these quintessential characters have refused to disappear, making their way into the re- cent Chicano literature of the region and fulfilling their ancient roles as culture heroes and critics. The ranks of the picaros include Old World rascals like Pedro de Ordimalas (also spelled Urdemales) and his folkloric and sociological descendants from the distant Iberian peninsula. The popular con- sciousness distinguishes between the novelesque, obviously ficti- tious characters like Pedro, and the sociological picaros, who are ac- tual individuals (or characters closely drawn on them) that manifest or reflect the social prototype of the trickster pariah. There is no evi- dence of the arrival of literary picaros, such as Lazarillo de Tormes and Periquillo Sarniento, until the late nineteenth century, when books finally came into the hands of New Mexicans in significant quantities. Until the most recent generations, picaros have inhabited the nov- elesque narratives of the oral tradition. In recent years the folk tale or marchen, as it has existed for centuries, has been obliterated practical- ly overnight after the advent of electronic mass media. Now other oral genres such as belief narratives and jokes dominate the scene. The two-edged sword of humor, forever in the hands of the picaro, is now wielded almost exclusively in jokes, the last refuge of characters like Mano Fashico [Bro' Francis], Don Cacahuate [Sir Peanut], and Pel6n [Baldy] (C6rdova 9-14, 68-75, Reyna, 65-66, 73). MELUS, Volume 20, Number 2 (Summer 1995)</page><page sequence="2">16 ENRIQUE R. LAMADRID There need be no concern for the survival of the sociological pi- caros, those maladapted types who have always lurked around the fringes of Hispanic civilization. They have a permanent refuge in mi- tote y chisme, or gossip and anecdotal narrative. But what has been the fate of those novelesque rogues like Pedro de Ordimalas, whose scur- rilous adventures filled the folk tale? Their epistemological role in the culture prevents their definitive departure. Without them and their literary brethren, Hispanic society has too difficult a time in criticiz- ing itself. To function with full power in the collective conscience, pi- caros have to move beyond jokes and anecdotes. They need a wider, more mythic domain. They are so necessary for the health of the pop- ular imagination that they were certain to reappear at some point in the cultural landscape. In New Mexican letters in recent years, they are surfacing everywhere, now as literary creations. The long career of the picaro in New Mexican traditional culture and his most recent literary masks are the focus of this study. From the emergence of cultures and civilization in Europe and the Americas, the trickster has had the double role of first inventing cul- ture and later revitalizing it, making use of humor and symbolic in- version to illuminate the inevitable contradictions of societies and their institutions. The coyote as trickster and culture hero is a primor- dial character on the North American scene, where he plays the epic role of bringing fire and technology to humankind. Simultaneously, through his outrageous personal behavior, he has taught Native Americans how to relieve the pressures of an intense social life which values conformity as a basic survival mechanism (Levi-Strauss 224- 25, L6pez 84-85). In the beginning, European tricksters were also animals, examples of ingenuity and intelligence like the fox and the crow. But after the Greeks, ethical and moral lessons were taught by mentors who were increasingly anthropomorphic. By Roman times, these tricksters al- ready had human faces (Kerenyi 173-91). These roguish boys and young men emerged in the folklore and literature of romance cul- tures, most notably in Spain. Their social position as pariahs and out- casts, their avocation for travel, and their insatiable thirst for adven- tures of every kind gave them the liberty to explore their society and expose all its vices and contradictions ("'A Tolerated Margin of Mess"' 158-60, "'Liberty's a Whore"' 98-99, Guillen 83, Parker 1-27). When the Spanish picaros arrive in New Mexico to face their Na- tive American cousins, it is not so much an encounter as a reunion. The twin traditions have maintained their differences: myth remains the domain of Native American tricksters, while the realm of Iberian picaros tends to be society (Ballinger 21-38). But the two millennial</page><page sequence="3">THE PICARO IN THE LITERATURE OF NEW MEXICO traditions also evolved a degree of syncretism, as can be seen in the Indo-Hispano coyote stories as well as the fiesta buffoons whose an- tics animate traditional feasts. These ritual counterparts of fictional tricksters are the Puebloan koshares (Parsons 44-73, Makarius 163-95, Hieb 1-36) and Indo-Hispano abuelos ("The 'Aguelos' of New Mexico" 71-78, Steele 491-514), the notorious sacred clowns and bogeymen of the ceremonies and dances of the region. By definition, tricksters and picaros serve as mythic and social me- diators of the contradictions which underlie their cultures. They are culture heroes because they are the only beings fully capable of illu- minating or bringing attention to these problems. Their most basic techniques are symbolic inversion and humor. As to their personali- ties, their most necessary trait is a singular lack of vergiienza, or shame (Valdez 99-106). As sinvergiienzas, or shameless ones, they are sanctioned to "llamarle pan al pan y vino al vino [to call bread, bread and wine, wine]," to call an ace an ace, if they happen to feel like it. They are mediators of the ecological and economic contradictions of their world. Since they have no vested interests, nor anything else to lose, they can confront social contradictions as well. With sarcasm and laughter they expose the discrepancies between the ideal image a society has of itself and the reality of its actions. In a multicultural so- ciety like New Mexico, picaros also confuse and violate the limits of class and ethnicity to confront and even provoke intercultural con- flict (Mares). Coyote has passed freely between cultures since the Iberians first encountered him in Mexico. His millennial persistence in the cultural and natural history of North America is due as much to his ecological opportunism as to his considerable mammalian intelligence. A hunter of little consequence and a great gobbler of carrion, in Native American mythology he is the only animal spirit capable of bridging the vast religious contradictions that exist between the ancient pale- olithic hunting culture, where sustenance derives from death, and the agriculture of more recent neolitihic times, where sustenance de- rives from growth and life (Levi-Strauss 202-28). Even though His- panic folklore of New Mexico lacks Promethean or fire-bringing coy- otes, there are many moral fables in which Coyote acts out one of his most familiar roles from Native American narratives, deceiving other animals, sometimes with success and other times falling victim to his own traps. In "El pajaro Garaba'n" [The Garaban Bird], a tale collected in the 1930s by Juan B. Rael (II: 466-68), Coyote convinces a dove that he is capable of knocking down the tree whose branches shelter her nest. To placate him she throws down her young one by one for him to eat. 17</page><page sequence="4">ENRIQUE R. LAMADRID At the advice of a magpie, the dove dares to resist the siege. In a com- ic attack, the coyote tries to tear the tree apart, and is left bloody, toothless, and hairless as a result. In every aspect except the language it is told in, this story is almost identical to Native American narra- tives of the region in which the coyote is the victim of his own wiles (Lopez 48-49). Curiously, in his determined search for the Iberian roots of New Mexican folklore, pioneer folklorist Aurelio M. Es- pinosa found a similar story in Spain in 1920 with a fox replacing the coyote (Folklore 68-69). Other mestizo or culturally hybrid fables which feature Coyote con- tain successively more European elements and characters, such as the domestic animals introduced by Spain to the Americas. The charac- ters of Native American tales typically only contain native animals. In "El burro y las coyundas" [The burro and the harnesses] (Rael II: 465-66), Coyote is the only non-domestic animal. After helping to re- cover some harnesses that Coyote has stolen from some farmers, a clever burro beats Coyote at his own game. He pretends to be dead, swells himself up and extends his rectum. The temptation of such tender sweetmeats is too much of a temptation for Coyote. When he begins to eat the tripitas [intestines], the burro retracts them, trapping the coyote inside his belly. When the burro turns over the coyote to his masters, they skin him alive. The scatological themes and the skinless coyote appear often in Native American narratives. In a story named "El Machincito" [Little Monkey] (Rael II: 525-31), a coyote named Machincito finds himself in a totally European set- ting. One of the exploits of this canine picaro is his quest to seek and find "La Babieca," the legendary horse of Rodrigo de Vivar, the Cid himself. Despite their marvelous gift of speech, all of these coyotes are projections of the small and sagacious canis latrans that roams the mountains and deserts of the Southwest. As the discussion turns to human characters, it is necessary to point out that in the complex ethnic mosaic of New Mexico there are also human "coyotes." In the colonial New Spain, coyote was a caste term for the progeny of barcino [mixed caste] and mulata [black/white] parents (Santamaria 308-09). Before long it came to mean a dark mestizo [mixed breed]. In New Mexico, the term is still used to designate those persons who are half Hispanic and half Oth- er, either Anglo American or Native American. These ethnic coyotes, like their animal namesake, have great potential as cultural media- tors, a literary role in which they have been featured (Mares 20-23, Cantos del coyote 1-3, "Gallos" 62-63, Sagel 26-41). Before we explore the rogue's gallery of New Mexican human pi- caros, their Spanish and Latin American precursors have to be intro- 18</page><page sequence="5">THE PICARO IN THE LITERATURE OF NEW MEXICO duced. The Spanish picaro por excelencia and the most celebrated of all times is Lazarillo de Tormes (1554), the clever boy whose hilarious adventures announced to the world the moral and social bankruptcy of the Imperial Spain of Felipe II, ostensibly the wealthiest country on earth. From the times of Lazarillo to the present, picaresque literature with its comic anti-heroes has been the most potent form of cultural, social, and political criticism in the Hispanic world. It is neither coin- cidence nor accident that the first Latin American novel, El periquillo sarniento [The Itchy Parrot] by Jose Joaquin Fernandez de Lizardi (1816), would be the picaresque story of another mischievous boy who exposes the tremendous social malaise of New Spain in the last decades before the wars of independence. According to Claudio Guillen, the classic Spanish pfcaro incorpo- rates and transcends three ancient literary types: the wanderer, the fool, and the have-not. Like Ulysses himself or any good knight er- rant, the picaro also travels on roads and highways, but his wander- ings serve the transcendental purpose of social criticism. Like the buffoon, the picaro knows human weakness and knows how to pro- voke laughter; nevertheless as a character he is complex, unhappy, and discontented, introspective and reflexive. The picaro is not static, but rather grows, learns, and changes because of his experiences. A person without material resources, the picaro is a social pariah whose companions are thieves, ruffians, and beggars; but he himself never becomes a criminal: "He is sly and lives on his wits, just short of delinquency or criminality. Guile and wile are his only offensive weapons and a stoical good humor is his defensive one. Philosophi- cally, he is a cynic" (76). Although in some cultures he wouldn't be considered to be much more than a pathetic or ridiculous vagrant, the picaro offers Hispanic civilization a mirror in which it can con- template itself critically. Even though Lazarillo and Periquillo are literary characters, his- torical sources affirm the proliferation of their sociological prototypes in sixteenth century Spain as well as colonial New Spain. The anony- mous author of Lazarillo de Tormes painted an accurate if squalid por- trait of the society he knew, in which the vocation of ldzaro, or guide for the blind, was an option for poor children, and the streets of Spain were certainly filled with poverty. Before examining the sociological roots of New Mexican pfcaros, it is necessary to consider their myth- ic and novelesque brethren of traditional oral narratives. The fame of Pedro de Ordimalas and his terrestrial and metaphys- ical adventures extends over all the Spanish-speaking world, from the southern archipelagos of Chile to New Mexico in the far north- lands. From an early age Pedro loses that shame, or vergiienza, that 19</page><page sequence="6">ENRIQUE R. LAMADRID orders, pacifies, and ultimately limits the lives of the rest of hu- mankind. He detaches himself from everything that most ties us to life: family responsibilities, work, the fear of God and death. By his wits alone, he attains everything in life without sacrificing himself to family, without dedicating himself to God nor selling himself to the Devil. He is so crafty that neither God nor the Devil could outwit him in the end. He is the only man who gains access to heaven not by faith but by his imaginative manipulation of the rules of religion and society. He is the projection of all of our asocial desires, without ceas- ing to be a good man. He is a picaro that tricks without malice and without deception. In New Mexican stories, Pedro de Ordimalas begins life as a good but shiftless boy who marries and begins his family. He is a good husband, but his obsession with gambling fast becomes his ruin. Cu- riously, his very instincts as a gambler are his salvation in the end. Everything changes in his life when, in a divine visitation reminis- cent of Greek mythology, God and Saint Peter come in disguise to earth to test the charity and generosity of the people (Kerenyi 173-91). As the story goes: They met Pedro and asked him for charity, but he had been at the casi- no and had lost all of his money. Yet he felt sorry for the strangers so he ran back to the casino and asked his friends for fifty cents. They gave Pedro a few coins and he returned to the two beggars and gave this money to them. Then the Lord said, "Well, Pedro, you are a good man. For giving a handout to the poor you may now ask for any wish to be granted." "I only want my fifty cents back," Pedro shrugged, "so I may prove to my friends that I didn't give it away." "But I want to reward you more handsomely," the Lord said. "Ask for another gift and it will be yours." Pedro thought awhile. "Well, I would like to be able to go to a place and if I did not want to leave not even God almighty could make me leave." "But that is so easily arranged," the Lord said. "Ask for more." Pedro raised an eyebrow. "How about a magical deck of cards?" "Very well. Ask for more," said the Lord. "I would like to have a drum," Pedro grinned, "and whoever sits down to play it cannot get up without my permission. And I would like for you to take my father, mother, all my brothers, and my own wife and family so they won't suffer any more." "What else do you want, Pedro?" the Lord asked. "Well," Pedro scratched his ear, "promise me that when you take me you will take both body and soul - that way I won't die!" 20</page><page sequence="7">THE PICARO IN THE LITERATURE OF NEW MEXICO "All that you have asked for will be granted," the Lord replied and He and St. Peter disappeared." (Griego y Maestas and Anaya 163).1 His innate generosity and modesty are qualities highly esteemed by the Lord, but his human intelligence is what permits him to test the limits of life and death. In some versions Pedro kills, or rather euthanizes, his family, and in others they die from being abandoned, but according to the divine contract, they go straight to Heaven. Then Pedro is free to try out the wishes the Lord granted him. With the magic cards, his winnings are so facile and prodigious that boredom sets in. That is precisely when he begins his quest for spiritual riches. In various confrontations with Death, he prevails by using his magic drum to which she becomes ir- revocably stuck when she sits on it. But as with all human beings, one of Death's arrows finally pierces him and he succumbs to his own ex- tinction. Faithful to his promise, God does not separate Pedro's soul from his body. He sends him to babysit the children in Limbo (that liminal place where unbaptized infants go after they depart). There they can- not stand Pedro because he begins baptizing every babe in sight, drowning most in the process. From there God sends him to Purgato- ry where he proves himself equally obnoxious, because he begins meting out penance to the souls, whipping them to intensify their pain so they can suffer more, pay their theological debt, and leave before their allotted time. When God sends Pedro to Hell, the devils complain because of the excruciating pain he causes them by insist- ing on shouting out the holy names of Jesis, Maria y Jose. Finally the Lord sends him to take care of a herd of sheep, an hon- orable occupation, besides being typically New Mexican. In a great meadow, Pedro finds the gates of Heaven where he distracts his namesake, the gatekeeper San Pedro, for an instant and slips by. Even though God wanted to expel him from this pleasant place where he had no business being, Pedro reminds him of his final wish, that he didn't have to leave a place, even though God wanted him to. Like some kind of folkloric Orpheus, Ordimalas visits Hell and the other metaphysical realms, not for the love of Eurydice, but for self- interest in being the first man to reach Heaven not by faith, but by in- telligence. In a surreal touch, God turns him into a stone in accor- dance with his name Petros, but a stone with eyes. In other folk sto- ries, Pedro de Ordimalas has other adventures, but those profiled 21</page><page sequence="8">ENRIQUE R. LAMADRID here include the favorite episodes, recounted and collected in New Mexico before the storytelling tradition waned. Besides Pedro de Ordimalas, there is a whole series of folkloric characters with some picaresque characteristics, such as Don Cac- ahuate and Dona Cebolla [Sir Peanut and Lady Onion], the Manos Fashicos [Bro' Francis], Bertoldo, Bertoldino, Cacaseno, and a num- ber of Juanes or Jacks (Rael). In the majority of the tales, these charac- ters are not much more than simpletons or buffoons. They lack the category of transcendence that permits them to be picaros and the in- telligence to be cultural heroes. The transcendental picaro can feign stupidity to disguise his intelligence, but he never sacrifices it. Even though Don Cacahuate at times may resemble a picaro, his stories and jokes always present him as a tonto, a dimwit, especially when he tries out all the novelties of the new fangled nineteenth and twentieth century American technology-from trains and airplanes, which to- tally mystify him, to motor vehicles, which he always manages to wreck (Cordova 68-75). If we leave to one side the idiot picaros, one of the Juans emerges that does deserve to join the category of tran- scendent picaro. The Juan Carbonero [Jack the Charcoal Man] story is known by various titles in the collections such as "The Woodcutter," or even "Dofa Sebastiana" [Lady Sebastian-ie. Death], but many versions were widely told in New and Old Mexico.2 Poor but generous, this Juan sacrifices himself for his children, giving them food, even when there is never enough for him. After much suffering and resignation, he finally gets a chicken or turkey for himself alone to eat. In some versions he steals it and in others his wife does. Deep in the moun- tains he roasts it and the aroma attracts various religious personages, including Christ and the Virgin, who ask for a bite. Juan very calmly denies them their request, explaining to Christ that: I don't think I'll invite you to share my meal, and I'll tell you why. I think you neglect the poor. You give everything to the rich and so little to the poor. You don't treat us equally. (Griego y Maestas and Anaya 17) He heaps blame on the Virgin for the "injustices" of her son, telling her: No, I am not going to share my food with you, and I'll tell you why. I think your Son neglects the poor. Since you are the mother of God, you should intercede for us so He would make us all equal. Either we should all be rich, or we should all be poor. The way it is now, He makes some very rich and some very poor, and unfortunately I am one 22</page><page sequence="9">THE PICARO IN THE LITERATURE OF NEW MEXICO of the poor ones. For that reason I am not going to share my chicken with you. (Griego y Maestas and Anaya 17) But when Doiia Sebastiana, the New Mexican nickname for la pelona, la huesuda, the bald and bony one, or Death herself comes to him, he says: I never realized Death was so thin!... Of course you are welcome to share my food, and I'll tell you why. You do things very well. You don't play favorites with the wealthy because of their money, not the beauti- ful because of their beauty, nor do you play favorites with the ugly or the old or the young. No, you treat us all equally. Sit down and share my meal. (Griego y Maestas and Anaya 19) The democracy of death, an ancient medieval topos [theme or com- monplace], appears anew in New Mexican folklore. The notion ap- peals to Juan Carbonero, and he shares his food. Another picaro that matches wits with Death and wins, the humble woodcutter, is re- warded with a gift for curing the sick. He has the power of seeing the presence of Death at the foot or the head of the bed of the sick person. If she is at the foot, then any remedy of water, earth or dust will cure. If she appears at the head, there is no remedy. Like every human hero, Juan Carbonero commits his fatal error when he tries to cure the son of the king even though Doia Sebastiana is at the head. He dies because of his ambition to help the king and defiance of Death's orders. When, for social and technological reasons, the cuentos or folk tales disappear from the oral repertoire of New Mexico, the mythic picaros also go into exile until poets and novelists rehabilitate them. The mock epic, Las aventuras de Juan Chicaspatas by Rudolfo Anaya (1985), is the first Chicano literary work that treats metaphysical questions with novelesque characters. The hero Chicaspatas [Littlefeet-a slang nickname for Chicano] with his sidekick Al Penco [a pejorative term for a man who seduces married women] start off on an (anti-)heroic quest that culminates in the construction of Chicano identity. Like Juan Carbonero and Pedro de Ordimalas, through excess and defi- ance of norms and expectations, they recklessly redefine their cultur- al universe by transgressing its limits. Anaya evokes the exuberance and raw vitality of the folk picaros as he draws them into a literary frame. With tongue in cheek, he attributes the invention of Chicanis- mo to these rogues, who chart the mythology of the Chicano movement from its renaissance in the late sixties and seventies to the present. In his first harangue, Chicaspatas announces his fervent de- votion to la madre, the great mother, and his desire to find Aztlan, the 23</page><page sequence="10">ENRIQUE R. LAMADRID mythical place of origin of the Aztecs and present homeland of Chi- canos: Arms of the women, I sing, arms of the women I have known, women I have left behind as I, a proud Chicano boy, set out to find Aztlan. To these women I sing: Malinche, Madre de los mestizos, mother of all Chicanos, to her I returned with my trusty companion, Al Penco. To the Virgin de Guadalupe I sing: may she guide me where roses grow and light my way so the world may know the beauty and pride of my people. To la Llorona I sing: wailing woman at the water's edge in you I found my manhood. To my jefita I sing and praise her every step, her strength, her daily work, her love, her sacrifice, so that i, Juan Chicaspatas, a Chicano homeboy, can grow into the future. (Anaya 5-6) These encounters comprise a catalog of the mythic women of Chi- cano historic, religious, and popular culture, personified in la Mal- inche, the arch-traitoress of Mexico; the Virgin de Guadalupe, Mexi- co's mother goddess; la Llorona, the wailing woman of folk tradition; and la jefita, the indefatigable domestic mother figure. Al Penco, the incarnation of the mischievous and innovating spirit of the pachuco [zoot-suiter or gangster], sings his praise to the divine madness of an- other divine patroness, the mind-expanding Chicana muse, Mari Jua- na [cannabis sativa]: 24</page><page sequence="11">THE PICARO IN THE LITERATURE OF NEW MEXICO Now Al Penco cried out and cut short my invocation. "Hey, bro, sing also to Maria Juana, diosa de los locos!" "I sing to Maria Juana," I continued, "for it was Maria Juana, muse of poets, sorceress of many minds, she gave us the power to travel on smoke, to visit our Mother, Malinche. Oh, let me sing! I am inspired to sing How Malinche declared us to be epic heroes! (Anaya 6) A cultural innovator, Al Penco, suffers from the original sin of the vato loco [bad dude], machismo, the other face of his companion Chicaspatas. Other mythic presences in the work are el Mero Chingon and la Chingada Madre, the popular slurs which Octavio Paz psycho- analyzed as the prototypical conquistador/violator and his accom- plice/victim, the violated Indian mother (65-88). Until now the only critical response to Anaya's mock epic has been one of indignant in- comprehension, that charges him with the "mal-creation" of Chicano history (Sanchez 25), an inappropriate burlesque of Chicano "origin" myths or the glorification of antisocial or sexist characters. However, Anaya has successfully addressed the picaresque spirit that resides at the heart of the greater Hispanic/Chicano tradition. Interestingly, these two characters found their way into Anaya's latest novel, Alburquerque (1992). The other literary work that treats mythic or novelesque picaros is a work-in-progress, the still unpublished novel of Juan Estevan Arel- lano, Pedro de Ordimalas, in which Pedro himself is reincarnated as a vato loco, complete with his lowrider car, flashy clothes and dark sunglasses. With the exception of these few novelesque or mythic characters, it is the sociological picaro that has dominated the literature since Lazarillo de Tormes. The model of the picaro with the human face in Spanish literature is doubtless the social type of the maladjusted or marginalized youth of all historical eras who, to survive, live as vagabonds or delinquents, and who, by definition, reject social con- vention. As has been noted, in the sixteenth century the streets of 25</page><page sequence="12">ENRIQUE R. LAMADRID Spain were filled with suitable models for the author of Lazarillo de Tormes. From the first years of the remote colony of Nuevo Mexico, the so- ciological prototypes for picaresque characters were also abundant, even though the literary picaros would not appear until the late twentieth century. In a report on the conditions in the kingdom of New Mexico that he sent to the king in 1626, the Franciscan friar Ger6nimo de Zarate Salmeron complained of the colonists' lack of ambition and interest in exploiting the considerable mineral wealth of the land. He claimed that: as long as they have a good supply of tobacco to smoke, they are very contented, and they do not want any more riches, for it seems as if they had made the vow of poverty, which is a lot for being Spaniards, who because of greediness for silver and gold will enter Hell itself to obtain them.... (56) In their literary reflections, many contemporary New Mexicans ask themselves the same question: Is it better to work to live or live to work? This colonial text is the first evidence of a fundamental change of attitudes and values, the birth of a new regional mestizo conscious- ness in New Mexico. What the priests and colonial officials see as laziness is, in reality, a new appreciation of life and the harmony of the natural world that the Native Americans shared with their neigh- bors. These people already were participants in what Juan Estevan Arellano calls the great, honorable "oficio de no tener oficio" [vocation of doing without a vocation] in the first picaresque novel of New Mexico: "Inocencio: ni pica, ni escarda, pero siempre come el mejor elote" [Inocencio, never digs nor hoes, but always gets the best ears of corn].3 The marginality and remoteness of New Mexico from the centers of power of the colonial metropolis is another factor that has perhaps contributed to the abundance of picaresque models. The picaro can- not exist completely outside society, but neither can he conform to its demands. His marginality is expressed in physical and geographic terms. We find him along borders, and, in the case of New Mexico, in the tiny villages of the sierra and the poor barrios of the city. Like Pe- dro de Ordimalas, Inocencio is a shepherd, a time-honored profes- sion of fringe dwellers. In approaching Inocencio, it is worth mentioning the observation that all of the critics of the picaresque tradition share: the metaphori- cal state of orphanhood of the picaro. Somehow, the picaro is always the orphan of the social system that gave birth to him. Consequently, 26</page><page sequence="13">THE PICARO IN THE LITERATURE OF NEW MEXICO his lack of adequate socialization to survive in the system is exactly what gives him the painful critical perspective of the system that sup- ports and deceives us all. The picaro has to live in society because the fabled pastoral refuges beyond its borders do not exist at all. Aban- doned and badly brought up, the picaro participates in social life without being an accomplice to it. Therefore, he can neither reject nor join together with his fellows. His marginality is painful but neces- sary. The scene of Inocencio leaving home fits impeccably into the greater Hispanic picaresque tradition. In one of the first paragraphs, he leaves his beloved home, taking leave with many tears of the mother he will never see again: I remember that with a frown, I left my Home Sweet Home to go to work...see here, soul of my own heart...to take care of a flock of sheep for a friend of the family, my godfather, that the guys called-well it was me, forgive me godfather...may God keep him in heaven-they called him Tall Antonio for short. Since we were so poor, we didn't know we had it so good. I was even barefoot when I left my home for work. But before leaving the nest on the road to Las Tuzas, with my pants ripped out behind, crusty cheeks, and watery eyes, I went up to my dear mother. I looked at her innocent cheeks, and hugged her hard. Who would guess...well... such is life.. .there I had her for an instant before letting go... once more she straightened out my eyes. Those black lanterns shown but only my heart felt the pain-and still feels it-while a tear lightly washed my dirty cheek as it streamed from my eye. And later, to calm my bones...like a fool...so I would forget, I went to play with Tumbaga and the bitch comes and bites me on the cheek. I didn't notice that I was eating a piece of meat. I still have the scar un- der my right eye. And I didn't even cry.... (J. E. Arellano 15-16; my translation) Like Lazarillo, Inocencio leaves the nest to work for his first patr6n or boss. Later, when he goes to school, he discovers the lackadaisical, but profound, vocation of "not having a vocation." What they teach in schools is how not to work, how not to help each other as people once did in New Mexico before the arrival of the cash economy and the values of competition and individualism: Not everyone does well under the yoke. Today these kids already have beards and aren't worth anything; the schools only teach them to be bums. Now they want everything they see on TV...just laughing at all that garbage. Before kids worked, now nothing. Back then during the harvest the 27</page><page sequence="14">ENRIQUE R. LAMADRID neighbors got together one night in one house, another in another, to tie up bunches of chile, to pit fruit, to husk corn; the men threshed wheat with goats, and brought in the pumpkins before the first frost. We all had something to do. For kids this was great; we had so much work at home that nobody went to school during September and October. The houses glowed with ristras of chile; pumpkins decorated the mud roofs and the air was filled with the sounds of cattle coming down from the mountains. Now everyone has lost their lands to the National Forest and the Tex- ans own half of the northlands. Another thing, since everything is canned, the land is no longer tilled, the plots the old timers worked so hard to cultivate are nothing but sagebrush. ...Now it's come to naught, the kids spend all damn day looking at cartoons on TV, when they aren't laying rubber in their hot cars, "melt- ing tar!" (J.E. Arellano 94-95; my translation) What he discovers is that all of New Mexico has a new patron, the American government, and the best way to trick him is to not work, to not participate in the new economic system, to rebel by being a beneficiary of "la huevona" [lazybones], a pun on "Welfare," the pub- lic assistance program that has tried to remedy the poverty of rural New Mexico caused by the loss of lands and the eclipse of the tradi- tional collectivist economy. In exchange for their lands, people are re- ceiving USDA commodities, powdered milk and what the people still call "Reagan cheese." These are the poignant moral lessons and scathing critiques of the New Mexican picaros. Another yoke upon the people, another boss that rules in the most humble and marginalized sectors of society, is alcohol. After his mother's death, Inocencio begins to drink. This scene is the funeral of his aunt when he asks her to greet his mother when she sees her in heaven: Taking another hit from the Bird [Thunderbird Wine] to drown his pain, Inocencio, falling down and stinking of cheap wine, gave his hand to the minister, who was quite a drunk in his own time, and still on the sly; behind the outhouse or on the hill. Soon Inocencio broke out crying and tried to calm down the preacher: -Uncle, I'm so sorry that Jesus Christ your father died, but soon Holy Week will be here so he can revive and those who observed lent can sin for another year; with a clean slate; with "a fresh set of tires." Some go to greet the dawn and others to eat fried bread-and there he let loose another that didn't quite follow; but his stubbornness contin- ued: Those poor drunkards down at the grave yard, May God send them to heaven for drinking so hard! (J. E. Arellano 22; my translation) 28</page><page sequence="15">THE PICARO IN THE LITERATURE OF NEW MEXICO A spirit distilled from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, al- cohol is both salvation and perdition for the picaro, revelation and martyrdom. The best loved and best known Dionysian picaro in recent New Mexican literature is Celso, the character whose visionary presence dominates various books by the poet Leo Romero. The alcoholism of Celso is heroic; it is the poetic license that has released one of the most prodigious displays of lyricism in recent years in New Mexico. From his early years, Romero has been a sympathetic admirer of the delirious philosophical and aesthetic ramblings of the vagabonds and winos of his home town, Las Vegas, New Mexico. He also shares their pain. Romero obliges himself to explain in his poetry readings that his intention is to celebrate not the vice of alcohol but, rather, the sacramental spirit of the ancient Greek religions. Celso himself is the principle priest of his religion of wine. This burlesque tone fits per- fectly into the traditional picaresque critique of religion: The Gospel According to Celso In the beginning there was a glass of wine new and shimmering in the sunlight Celso tasted it and declared it to be good That is how I became a drunkard The rotten pillar of my community A good for nothing explains Celso (Romero 50) Even though the poet and townspeople laugh at the old man, they also know that he is right. After all, truth is revealed and hidden in wine: in vino veritas. The disciples of Celso flock to his side in the vil- lage of Agua Negra (where the grandmother of the poet lived): The Sermon of the Grape Drink of the blood which is His blood says Celso 29</page><page sequence="16">ENRIQUE R. LAMADRID holding a bottle of red wine above his head... Celso has many disciples The poor, the wretched the misfits and outcasts of Agua Negra They gather about him as long as the wine holds out A rich man will not get through the eye of a camel if he does not give away his riches, Celso says drunkenly And he passes around the bottle of wine (Romero 51) But Celso's best disciples are his readers. In these texts there is an implicit desacramentalization of the con- ventional values of religion, another time-honored picaresque task (Babcock-Abrahams, "A Tolerated Margin" Guillen 82). Celso effec- tively subverts the concept of popular religiousness, adapting it to his lyric and delirious purposes. The delirium of Celso has frequent surrealist shades, as in this bilingual poem: Una Cancion de Flores [A Flower Song] Listen to Celso and you'd think anything was possible Celso claims the moon is a woman who carries a large knife He has seen her cut down stars which came too close Anoche la luna [Last night the moon sali6 de los arboles came out of the trees con un cuchillo largo with a long knife La luna tiene cabello The moon has hair ojos blancos white eyes labios blancos white lips] Celso has heard the moon sing songs of flowers 30</page><page sequence="17">THE PICARO IN THE LITERATURE OF NEW MEXICO Celso carries a long knife to be like the moon He tells everyone he is in love and brandishes the knife gently as if he were beheading roses (Romero 33; my translation) As a picaro, Celso is without a doubt from the transcendental school. Even though he has sociological origins, his alienation is so lyric that he is ultimately redeemed by it. In 1985, the Chicano playwright Jorge Huerta directed a dramatic adaptation of the Celso poems that was well received in theaters across the Southwest. The other dramatic work that must be mentioned as an example of the Dionysian picaresque of New Mexico is "Tito" by Romulo Arel- lano (1987). As a character, Tito distinguishes himself from Celso by his tragic vision of life. The hero, whose model was a personal friend of the author, dies singing alabados [hymns to the Passion of Christ] and popular songs. Nevertheless, the work incorporates enough di- rect political humor that it has to use sarcastic pseudonyms to criti- cize the most corrupt politicians of the picturesque county of Rio Ar- riba. The monologue captures perfectly the joke-telling style of the re- gion. Three politicos, governor Apoyos (Jerry Apodaca, in reality), senator Trajerellas (C.B. Trujillo), and the boss of the county, Toronjo (Emilio Naranjo), are flying in a plane above the county. When the motor stops suddenly, they realize that there are only two parachutes (called paraguas or umbrellas) and the pilot jumps, taking one with him. Since each of the others thinks he is the most important, they de- cide to conduct a secret ballot to see who will use the parachute: Well Governor Apoyos and C.D. Trajerellas start to write but Edmundo Toronjo, he don't have a pen cause you, know he never works. He just give the orders. So he have to wait until C.D. is finished, and then he borrow his pen. Then they throw the little cards into Edmundo's hat... Then they finally reach in and pull the cards out and then they count the votes. And C.D. Trajerellas, he got one vote and Governor Apoyos, he got one vote and Edmundo Toronja, man, he got sixteen votes. (R. Arellano 102) 31</page><page sequence="18">ENRIQUE R. LAMADRID Even though Tito, the protagonist, is definitely picaresque, the cen- tral tragedy converts the work into a profound personal elegy that in the end sacrifices its transcendent picaresque aspirations. Another extraordinary work that contains some picaresque traits is Martin by Jimmy Santiago Baca (1987). The poem is an epic that traces the formation and foundation of the personal, social, and cul- tural worlds of the protagonist Martin, orphan, victim of his family and society, who embarks on a quest in search of himself. There are profound and wrenching episodes in this odyssey, but the reintegra- tion of the hero at the end of the work signals its epic rather than pi- caresque structure. As has been shown, there are manifestations of the New Mexican picaresque that still live in the oral traditions that created them. The presence of Coyote in the traditional Native American cultures will continue until the final extinction of his prodigious species, unless humanity disappears, which will surely happen first. The life of the new literary picaros is, in a certain sense, more precarious than their folkloric cousins, because they depend more on paper, ink, readers and critics than on the will of the people to keep on orally recreating them. But what unifies all this New Mexican clan of sinvergfienzas, ociosos y borrachitos [shameless ones, bums, and drunks] are the criti- cal and burlesque answers that they flaunt to the questions we dare to ask them. Like Celso says: I have seen children spit in their parents' eyes In the wind I can spit in my own eye Celso says as he shuts the door behind him (Romero 84) Notes This article evolvedfrom discussions with Juan Estevan Arellano and Arsenio "Gonito" Sanchez in the hills between Embudo and Ojo Sarco, New Mexico.
