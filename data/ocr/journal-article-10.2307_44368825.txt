The separation between mind and body, and between self and other, in Western thought present obstacles to understanding such modes of treatment. They lead anthropologists and others to see spirit healing and similar techniques as concerned with 'subjective' aspects of ill-health (ill- ness rather than disease, in Kleinman's well-known formulation) and to focus explanatory and analytical mod- els on social aspects of the healing process. The body can only be integrated into such analyses through as- sumptions of 'somatization,' the 'placebo effect,' etc., but these are of only limited use in understanding how spirit healing might affect bodily processes. I argue that we can go further, but only if we take the spirit-lan- guage more seriously; not in terms of occult forces, but as providing tokens and images for operating on the structure of human life at all levels, within a framework which does not assume rigid distinctions between mind and body, or self and other. An initial approach derives from taking spirits as representative of particu- lar modes of action and feeling. This enables us to see the language of the spirits as a way to rebalance organ- ismic functioning in relation to various kinds of physiological stress, a rebalancing which may be seen as con- tributing directly to organismic healing at a physiological (material) level, rather than operating in purely 'psychological' terms. It has long been recognised that modes of explana- tion and treatment for ill-health based on assumptions of spirit attack or other non-material causes exist in many societies. Frequently, if not always, they coexist with other forms of explanation and treatment that appear more 'rational' by Western biomedical standards. The precise details of the relationship, and the importance of the two modes of treatment, vary between societies. They imply, however, fundamentally contrasting ap- proaches to the causation of ill-health, 'naturalistic' and 'personalistic', to use George Foster's distinction (1976). Foster suggested that these two basic approaches or prin- ciples accounted "for most (but not all) of the etiologies that characterize non- Western medical systems" (Foster 1976: 775). A personalistic medical system is one in which dis- ease is explained as due to the active, purposeful in- tervention of an agent , who may be human (a witch or sorcerer), nonhuman (a ghost, an ancestor, an evil spirit), or supernatural (a deity or other very powerful being). The sick person literally is a vic- tim, the object of aggression or punishment di- rected specifically against him [ . . . ] In contrast to personalistic systems, naturalistic sys- tems explain illness in impersonal, systemic terms. Disease is thought to stem, not from the machina- tions of an angry being, but rather from such nat- ural forces or conditions as cold, heat, winds, damp- ness, and, above all, by an upset in the balance of the basic body elements. [ . . . ] Causality concepts explain or account for the upsets in this balance that trigger illness (Foster 1976: 775.) Foster's description of naturalistic systems focuses on hu- moral concepts. If we extend his definition to include other approaches that emphasise causal processes in the material world, rather than the agency of human, non- human or supernatural beings, then we can see contem- porary Western biomedicine as itself constituting a 'nat- uralistic' mode of explanation (one which, it might be noted, developed historically out of a humoral system).2 In practice, it is not always so easy to draw sharp dis- tinctions between the two modes of explanation within a specific social context, since they can be combined in all kinds of ways. Thus Rensje Teerink, in a study of ideas of disease causation in a Gujarati village (1995), notes that personalistic and supernatural modes of explanation</page><page sequence="2">8 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 24 (2) 2010 dominated in the village she studied, but adds that this "does not do justice to the complex realities of popular medical discourse" (1995: 101): It is not possible to make a clear distinction be- tween the personalistic and naturalistic medical sys- tems. In fact, the very distinction between both ae- tiologies seems erroneous since the villagers' discourse evades these Western-derived binary op- positions. Rather, the cause of disease is often ex- plained somewhere between the naturalistic and personalistic pole and shifts in emphasis from one pole to another, never to be quite pinned down. Thus village women with rateva , a disease of women ex- plained in terms of excess heat in the body, and inter- preted by local allopathic doctors as congenital syphilis, had difficulty giving birth to healthy, live children. They avoided ťhoť foods (meat, oil, jaggery, massalas , chilli) during pregnancy in order to reduce body heat, in ac- cordance with the 'naturalistic' hot-cold opposition, but in order to cure the condition were treated by mantras and other ritual procedures with strong 'personalistic' overtones by a local bhuwa or traditional healer (1995: 91-2). Women who suffered spontaneous abortions or miscarriages initially tended to identify a 'hot' bodily con- stitution or rateva as the cause, but many later informed Teerink that the real cause was black magic ( cookh band- hviy 'tying the womb' through sorcery, 1995: 100-1), an explicitly 'personalistic' explanation. Again, wawadi , a local disease-category mostly identified among small chil- dren, and identified by allopathic doctors as bronchop- neumonia, is explained through a 'naturalistic' etiology of incorrect diet. The primary form of treatment involves tattooing with a hot needle by an elderly woman special- ist. The tattoo ( dhaam ) is in the form of a trishul (tri- dent), here explicitly identified as the weapon of a re- gional goddess, Mahisagarma, and its application is linked to an offering to the goddess (1995: 95-7). I would argue that almost all human societies include elements of both kinds of explanation. Indeed, I would suggest that we can see the two kinds of explanation as deriving from basic modes of human functioning that are common to all societies and perhaps inbuilt into human biological equipment (see e.g. Comfort 1979: 54-61; Samuel 1990: 153-55). An anthropological reader here may see echoes of Lévy-Bruhl's famous opposition be- tween Western, logical modes of thought and primitive 'mystical participation,' a distinction with a long and messy history in anthropological thought (Lévy-Bruhl 1926, Evans-Pritchard 1965, Horton 1967, 1982), and of par- allel disputes such as those regarding the alternative logic identified by Benjamin Lee Whorf in some Native Amer- ican verb structures (Whorf 1956) or the allegedly 'de- temporalised' sense of Balinese time (Geertz 1966, Howe 1981, Gell 1992). Lévy-Bruhl, Whorf, and Geertz were pointing to important contrasts, but rather than empha- sizing the dichotomies, I would stress that both modes of explanation are in fact characteristic in differing degrees of all human societies (see also Samuel 1990: 170 n.9).3 The naturalistic mode of explanation derives from as- sumptions about linear causality within the external world that are necessary even in the most short-term, immedi- ate-return oriented of hunter-gatherer societies. Certain physical processes lead more or less reliably to certain re- sults; heating food over a fire transforms it; adding water to the contents of a heated pot prevents them from burn- ing; sharpening a knife-blade improves its ability to cut. That eating some things can make you very ill must have been a very early member of this particular set of items of knowledge, with obvious survival potential. One might also suppose that the basic hot-cold distinction that un- derlies most humoral models could derive from system- atic observation of the association between ill-health and body temperature. The personalistic mode of explanation, by contrast, is grounded in moral-ethical judgment. The key here is to work out who is responsible for things going badly or well, and to make sure as far as possible that the people or beings in question are on your side. This is also a basic part of human social existence, and perhaps goes back to the extremely old human problem of knowing whom you can trust (cf. Rappaport 1999). 4 My point however is not so much to argue for a biological grounding of the two modes of explanation as to note that they are both ubiq- uitous in virtually all human societies, in the explanation of ill-health as much as everywhere else. Ill-health can be explained in both naturalist and personalist terms. These may work neatly together: I am sick because you delib- erately gave me something bad to eat. More typically, though, they work on different planes, and as we know, assumptions of human or non-human malevolence do not necessarily depend on a fully-developed naturalist ex- planation for the harm caused. Idioms of sorcery, witch- craft, the evil eye or spirit-attack can easily fill the gap. Foster was concerned with modes of explanation in the societies studied by anthropologists; I have deliberately widened the scope of his distinction here to include the mode of explanation officially endorsed by our own soci- ety, that of biomedical science. 'Personalistic' (religious and magical) modes of explanation remain very much present within contemporary Western societies, and it is no longer adequate to treat them as anomalies or relics of pre-scientific thinking. Western societies, like most human societies, contain a mixture of both kinds of explanation,</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 24 (2) 201 0 9 often combined in complex ways. The main way in which Western and other technologically advanced societies dif- fer from other societies of the past and present, in rela- tion to the explanation and treatment of ill-health, is in the immense prestige afforded to biomedicine and the de- gree to which it receives State support. If I choose to regard biomedicine as less exceptional that it often appears to regard itself, this is not out of lack of respect for its achievements. Like most contem- porary Westerners, I have plenty of reason to be grate- ful to biomedical science, and critical remarks should be in no way be construed as a dismissal of the entire en- terprise, which has been a source of immense human benefit. The issue with biomedical science, however, is that its undoubted successes have tended to lead to a blind endorsement of the specific styles of naturalistic explanation which accompany it, and an equally auto- matic rejection of personalistic styles of explanation as pre-scientific and incorrect. I would prefer to see natu- ralistic and personalistic styles of explanation as alter- native modes of explanation, each with truth content, validity, and usefulness. Although the biomedical rejection of personalistic styles of explanation is often regarded as supported by science, it is in fact a difficult position to justify in terms of phi- losophy of science or sociology of knowledge. Philoso- phy of science moved decisively towards post-positivistic models of various kinds in the 1960s and 1970s, with the work of Sir Karl Popper, Imre Lakatos, Paul Feyerabend and others (Popper 1963, 1973; Feyerabend 1975; Lakatos and Feyerabend 1999). Parallel developments took place in the sociology of knowledge and the sociology of sci- ence at around the same time and slightly later, with the work of scholars such as Thomas Kuhn, Michael Mulkay, Bruno Latour and Donna Haraway (Kuhn 1970; Mulkay 1979; Latour and Woolgar 1979; Haraway 1991). A de- tailed presentation is hardly appropriate here,5 but it is by now clear enough that science progresses as much through the selective use of evidence to support particular scien- tific models and frameworks as through the objective and impartial evaluation of alternative modes of explanation. The point here is not that the particular models and frameworks endorsed by current scientific thinking in any specific field are mistaken. They clearly have both prac- tical and explanatory value. The point is rather that other, alternative approaches have been excluded, on the as- sumption that there can be only one truth, and that if one model is successful all other models are valueless. Evidence-based medicine, a dominant movement within contemporary biomedicine, is a classic example of such strategies, and it is relatively easy to demonstrate that many possible healing techniques simply cannot be evaluated through its canonical methods, and are there- fore routinely dismissed (e.g. Kaptchuk 1998; Adams 2002). To repeat, the problem here is not so much the canonical procedures of evidence-based medicine (the randomized double-blind controlled trial, etc) as the as- sumption that the model of knowledge underlying them is the only possible model, and that other models should therefore automatically be rejected as illegitimate. This is not science but what has been called 'scientism,' the naïve belief in the absolute priority of a particular kind of sci- entific research. Evidence-based medicine is also, of course, driven by vast and powerful commercial and legal interests. While it is concerned with identifying the most appropriate treatment for the patient it is also, and often more importantly, concerned with legitimating the prod- ucts of pharmaceutical companies, with issues of ad- ministrative efficiency and cost control, and with pro- tecting both medical specialists and pharmaceutical companies against legal action. Yet ordinary human beings, given a choice, have very commonly gone for medical pluralism, and have been fre- quently prepared to use personalisť idioms such as spirit- healing in tandem with evidence-based biomedicine. This suggests that a dismissal of personalist models as scien- tifically illegitimate may be missing something vital. In this article I am concerned specifically with a sub- set of personalist approaches, those that explain ill-health in terms of spirit action. Not all personalist approaches to healing use spirit vocabularies in the narrow sense, but spirit language, and healing techniques involving inter- action with spirits, constitute widespread and typical forms of personalist approaches. As far as contemporary biomedicine is concerned, explanations in terms of spirit action are radically unacceptable. Humoral theories, par- ticularly those which have a developed literary tradition such as the Islamic-Galenic, Ayurvedic and Chinese med- ical systems, may be given a certain degree of recognition within biomedicine as pre-scientific prefigurings of valid explanatory processes, and particularly as sources of nat- ural ingredients to be evaluated and where relevant in- corporated by biomedicine, but explanations in terms of spirit action are well beyond the pale (Samuel 2006a).6 I argue that anthropological analyses of spirit-heal- ing so-far have remained constrained and limited by our acceptance of the mind-body dichotomy. This has led anthropologists to see spirit-healing as concerned with subjective aspects of ill-health (illness rather than dis- ease, in Arthur Kleinmans well-known formulation) and to focus our explanatory and analytical models on so- cial and political aspects of the healing process. Since spirit-healing cannot, by definition, be efficacious within the terms of biomedicine, but is nevertheless regarded</page><page sequence="4">1 0 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 24 (2) 201 0 as efficacious, at least in principle, by people who use it, then its users must be mistaken in believing that it works. Any "efficacy" present has to do with minor psycholog- ical ailments, not with genuine organic problems. Here, to refer to Quack and Töbelmann s introductory article, we are clearly talking about efficacy of rituals of spirit- healing at two spheres or levels, that of the practition- ers and patients, on the one hand, and that of the re- searcher, on the other. The primary focus of this article, however, is on the second, on the ways in which the re- searcher might understand the efficacy of the ritual. In particular, I hope to show that it is by no means neces- sary to assume that spirit-healing can only be efficacious at a psychological level. Kleinman and Sung's classic 1979 article 'Why Do In- digenous Practitioners Successfully Heal?', a study of 'shamanic' healing in Taiwan, laid down the standard line of analysis for spirit-healing. Kleinman notes that7 [i]n the course of this research, I observed nearly 500 patients treated by shamans. My impression is that roughly half of these cases presented with health problems, a quarter with personal and fam- ily problems, and a quarter with business, financial and assorted other social problems. Many shaman- istic consultations dealt with crises, and crisis man- agement seemed to be a major function of the prac- tice of shamans (Kleinman and Sung 1979: 9). Elsewhere Kleinman suggests that "ninety percent of pa- tients treated by indigenous practitioners suffered from chronic, self-limited and masked minor psychological dis- orders. The last group, involving "somatization" of per- sonal and interpersonal problems, accounted for almost 50% of cases" (Kleinman and Sung 1979: 7). It should be noted that we are dealing with quite a small sample here, and with only one 'somewhat atypi- cal' healer (1979: 10), and that despite the use of the generic term "shaman" it can by no means be taken for granted that results derived from Taiwanese tâng-ki heal- ers can be generalized to so-called "shamanic" healers else- where. My interest is however not so much with Klein- man's results as with the mode of explanation he uses, which is essentially that of psychological reduction. Tâng- ki healers can be regarded as efficacious, from the re- searcher's point of view that is only because, in reality, they are dealing with minor psychological disorders, rather than the serious organic disorders that, in some cases at least, they and their patients believe that they are healing. Their realm of action is that of the subjective meanings of illness, not the organic processes of disease, and the interaction between the two is limited to the resid- ual categories of 'somatization,' in which subjective mean- ing manifests in physical forms which are essentially mar- ginal to the disease process, and the 'placebo effect,' in which physical healing takes place as a result of the 'ef- fective psychotherapy' undergone at the tâng-ki s shrine (1979: 24). Kleinman is by no means simply dismissive of the tâng- kï s work with subjective meaning, or in Kleinman's own terms 'illness': [M]ost traditional forms of healing include two closely interrelated functions: providing effective control of the disease or illness manifestations, and personal and social meaning for the experience of being ill in a particular cultural setting. Evaluations of healing (by either patient or practitioner) may involve both or only one of these functions. For pa- tients both are usually essential. For traditional practitioners the available evidence suggests that both are also usually taken into account. More and more, however, modern medical care seems to view only the former as the proper task of clinical care and disregards the latter (1979: 22). In his conclusion, Kleinman argues that, since most of the disorders encountered by biomedical practitioners are in fact similar to those treated by the Taiwanese tang-ki, with their central issues being illness rather than disease, therefore 'in most cases modern professional clinical care must fail to heal,' since it does not address illness, only disease (1979: 24): That many primary care physicians do, in fact, heal most of the time is a function of their clinical skills in treating illness as well as disease, by which they overcome the profound limitations and distortions of modern health care (1979: 24). One can sympathise with Kleinman's critique of the West- ern (perhaps specifically US) health system here, which was doubtless both more original and more courageous in its time than it would be some thirty years later. It is impor- tant to note, however, that his argument depends on a se- ries of dualisms: illness versus disease, the tâng-ki versus the modern clinician, the mind versus the body, and that interaction between mind and body, though admitted in the forms of 'somatization' and the 'placebo effect,' is left unexplained. Kleinman portrays the tâng-ki with whom he worked as an effective psychotherapist, but we have no real idea why his methods might have an impact in any specific situation. Kleinman's article nevertheless represented an im- portant opening to the part played by meaning in healing. From the 1970s onwards, a series of writers from within the medical profession itself began to suggest that the</page><page sequence="5">JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 24 (2) 201 0 11 mechanisms behind the 'placebo effect' were worthy of closer examination. A 1973 article by Adler and Hammett suggested that the placebo effect rested on a universal human need for a group to which to belong and a system through which to make sense of the world: It is suggested here that these two factors - group formation and system formation - are as essential to psychic functioning as nourishment is to physi- cal functioning, are the basic factors composing what is subjectively experienced as a feeling of "meaning," are invariably used in all successful in- terpersonal therapies, and are the necessary and sufficient components of the placebo effect Just as physiologic regulators of homeostasis provide the physical milieu for optimal functioning, so psy- chological regulators provide the parallel emotional milieu, with, of course, the same consequences from malfunctioning (Adler and Hammett 1973: 597-8). Adler and Hammett's phrasing suggests a standard mind- body dualism, and their article implies that the placebo effect is primarily relevant for 'functional maladies such as hypochondriasis, psychophysiologic disturbances, and most emotional disorders' (1973: 595). However, like Kleinman, they saw the placebo effect as a valid thera- peutic agent and well worthy of further study. By 2002, Daniel Moerman and Wayne Jonas could refer to "a re- newed interest in placebos and the placebo effect," citing "[a]t least five serious books on the subject" and constant references in the scholarly literature, while also implying that there had been little real progress in understanding the process in question (Moerman and Jonas 2002: 471). Their own suggestion was a focus on the "meaning re- sponse"; what heals is not the placebo, but the meaning given to it by the recipient. Meaning is an intrinsic part of all medical treatment: We define the meaning response as the physiologic or psychological effects of meaning in the origins or treatment of illness; meaning responses after the use of inert or sham treatment can be called the "placebo effect" when they are desirable and the "nocebo effect" ... when they are undesirable (2002: 472). They note that this definition is not phrased in terms of "nonspecific" effects; al- though many elements of the meaning response or placebo effect may seem nonspecific, they are often quite specific in principle after they are understood (2002: 473). Such arguments opened up the way to a rather more fine- grained approach to the placebo effect, and its negative counterpart, the nocebo effect: thus a number of recent papers by Ted Kaptchuk's group at Harvard Medical School have examined issues such as whether sham de- vices (as in 'fake' acupuncture) and placebo pills have sim- ilar effects (Kaptchuk et al. 2006), or whether one can separate experimentally the effects of assessment and ob- servation, therapeutic ritual, and supportive patient-prac- titioner relationship (Kaptchuk et al. 2008). Moerman cites work suggesting that the life expectancy of Chinese Americans may be shortened by several years "if they have a combination of disease and birth year which Chinese astrology and medicine consider ill fated" (Phillips, cited in Moerman 2002: 474). What none of these approaches really do is to explain how the placebo effect (or spirit-based therapies, in cases such as Kleinman and Sung's study) might affect body as well as mind. Theoretical approaches such as those of Kleinman, Adler and Hammett largely evade the ques- tion by assuming that the 'meaning effect' is operative primarily at the psychological level; experimental con- tributions such as those by Kaptchuk's group are pri- marily concerned with examining what is happening rather than exploring how it might be happening. Yet, at some point, theory and practice need to inform each other, and there is a limit to how far we are likely to be able to get with understanding spirit-based therapies un- less we have a model of the human organism within which meaning could in fact affect physiological processes. Meaning, though, is part of the stock in trade of an- thropologists, and it is worth asking whether anthropo- logical approaches to the role of meaning in healing could take us further in tracing the specific linkages between meaning and healing. As I have pointed out elsewhere, there are at least two partly-convergent lines of analysis that are worth con- sidering in this context. One goes back to the work of Victor Turner and other members of the Manchester School, particularly Bruce Kapferer. Turner's work on Ndembu ritual in the mid to late 1960s presented a model (or more precisely a series of models) of how ritual heal- ing might work which depended on his analysis of the polysémie nature of ritual symbols. Ritual symbols (in the Ndembu case, specific objects of natural origin) had both physiological referents (breast milk, blood etc) that tied in deeply to the psychological structure of each mem- ber of the society, as well as to social referents (lineage, motherhood, etc). The combination and manipulation of these symbols in ritual allowed the ritual to 'work' on the psychological</page><page sequence="6">12 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 24 (2) 2010 makeup of those undergoing the ritual, whether to bring about passage between social roles, or to bring about heal- ing, which was associated with initiation into a specific healing cult associated with a mode of spirit affliction (Turner 1968, 1970). Related aspects of Turners theory included his analysis of the liminal state as a ritually-cre- ated state of fluidity and 'communitas,' within which shifts in psychological structure could take place, and his dis- cussion of the work of the diviner as a 'social analyst' who identifies and prescribes the appropriate ritual solution for a given problem (Turner 1969, 1975). Turner's work was continued and developed by a number of other the- orists, including Bruce Kapferer, whose analyses of Sin- halese healing rituals (e.g. Kapferer 1979) explore in de- tail the ways in which these complex theatrical rituals might operate on the self-image of the patient, and Suzette Heald, whose work on Gisu male initiation rituals (Heald 1999) demonstrated the ways in which these rituals acted to create a particular kind of adult male personality with a specific emotional patterning. It is worth noting that this line of approach is not nec- essarily dependent on the structural-functionalist as- sumptions that formed Turner's own starting point. Turner writes as if ritual is, in general, good for society, and this can easily be read in terms of ritual being an essentially conservative, and even politically reactionary, force. The reaction against work such as Turner's in the 1970s was in part motivated by the increasing influence of critical the- ory, but it arguably went much too far. Work such as that of Maurice Bloch treated ritual and religion as a simplis- tic and repetitive assertion of the power of the established order, while the new cognitive anthropology represented by writers such as Dan Sperber or Pascal Boyer in effect treated religion as little more than an arbitrary series of mistaken assumptions (Samuel 1990, 2006b). In fact, as Kapferer and Heald's later work demonstrates (e.g. Kapferer 1997, 2000; Heald 2002, 2003), analysis of ritual processes as meaningful is not at all incompatible with an awareness of social and political inequality. Quite the opposite: it adds an important dimension to the analysis of inequality and oppression, since such processes are typically part both of how inequality and oppression are maintained, and how they are contested. William Sax makes a similar point in relation to the possibility of combining performance the- ory and critical medical anthropology. Speaking of the healing rituals of the Bhairav cult in the Garhwal Himalaya, he notes that such a combination allows us to analyse and understand how [these rituals] both re- flect and reproduce relations of power. These rela- tions are reproduced through the aesthetic habitus and inscribed on the body, and have specific im- plications for states of health and illness. Both crit- ical medical anthropology (in the widest sense) and the performative approach to ritual can be deep- ened and expanded by understanding the ways in which relations of domination and subordination are reproduced by the aesthetics of ritual perform- ance (Sax 2004: 304). The line of theorizing which derives from Turner's work allows one to see healing ritual as, in effect, psy- chotherapy, as working in complex and sophisticated ways to reshape the psychological patterning of individ- uals in order to restore their viability and reconnect them with their social context. It allows for a much more so- phisticated account of how meaning might heal, but re- mains, however, committed to the mind-body divide; the ritual works at the psychological level, not at the physical. A second line of theorizing which, by contrast, explic- itly works across the mind-body divide can be traced back to Claude Lévi-Strauss's classic if problematic study of a Cuna shamanic healing ritual for a breechbirth ([1949] 1977). Lévi-Strauss suggested that the imagery of the rit- ual enabled the woman to reconceptualise her chaotic and unbearable bodily sensations into a coherent and man- ageable form. Specifically, this reconceptualisation in- volved a journey of healing spirits inside the woman's body, and Lévi-Strauss assumed that the woman responded phys- ically to the imagery, allowing her cervix to dilate and thus easing the childbirth. The details of Lévi-Strauss's analy- sis have been contested, and it would seem unlikely that the woman's body would react in the rigidly-scripted man- ner presupposed by his interpretation (cf Sherzer 1989; Taussig 1992). My own preference would be to see the rit- ual less as dictating a particular series of changes within the woman's body, and more as providing her with a range of imagery that might assist her in responding more pos- itively to her predicament (cf Samuel 2005: 232-3). The general idea that the ritual might impact on the woman's body image, and so have a direct effect on phys- iological variables, is nevertheless convincing and im- portant (cf Laderman 1987, Samuel 2005: 231-3). We can see here the possibility of a systematic approach to how specific forms of ritual healing and similar processes might enable transformations at the physiological as well as the psychological level. One direction in which such an argument might be taken is represented by the work of Thomas J. Csordas in his book The Sacred SeĶ a study of charismatic healing in southeastern New England (Csordas 1997; see also Csor- das 2002). Here the ability of a ritual healer to bring about healing is explained in terms of a 'margin of disability':</page><page sequence="7">JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 24 (2) 201 0 13 It is well known, for example, that some people who become "legally blind" are able to engage in a wide range of activities, whereas others retreat to a posture of near total disability and inactivity. Like- wise, persons with chronic pain in a limb may be physically able to move that limb, but refrain from doing so for lack of sufficient motivation to make the risk of pain worthwhile. Disability is thus con- stituted as a habitual mode of engaging the world. The process of healing is an existential process of exploring the margin of disability, motivated by the conviction of divine power and the committed par- ticipanťs desire to demonstrate it in himself as well as by the support of the assembly and its acclama- tion for a supplicant's testimony of healing. [ . . . ] Healing [works] by challenging the sensory com- mitment to a habitual posture, by removing inhi- bitions on the motor tendency toward normal pos- tural tone, and by modulating the somatic mode of attention (Csordas 1997: 71-2). Csordas's analysis here is plausible, certainly for the spe- cific situation with which he is dealing, and it represents a significant step forward in its solid grounding in ethno- graphic observation. It remains limited, however, in how far it challenges the mind-body dichotomy of biomedicine. Csordas rightly highlights the significance of the 'somatic mode of attention' (see also Csordas 2002: 241-59), but he assumes that the somatic healing imagery can only work within the pre-given limits of the 'margin of disability'. One might say that the supplicant can only be healed because he or she is not really disabled, but only imagines (at a bodily level) himself or herself to be so. In this respect, Csordas does not take us much further than Kleinman and Sung's work.8 As with Kleinman and Sung's study, the bio- medical primacy of body over mind remains in place. The question remains whether one can go further, and see the imagery as creating real change at the physiologi- cal level. Given recent work on neuroplasticity and related fields,9 this would seem quite plausible, at least in areas that involve neural functioning, which includes a great deal. Both Lévi-Strauss's and Csordas's analysis suggests that a key issue in relation to spirit-healing and related prac- tices is to understand how human beings experience their bodies. The body image itself, as subjectively experienced, is however a far from simple matter, and talking about it is also not simple. Part of the problem here is the extent to which mind-body and related dichotomies are built into the structure of the English language and the habits of Western discourse. As we work with a concept such as the body image, which has both physiological and psy- chological sides, we can easily slip over into one or the other sideģ Csordas suggests that North American modes of thought make it quite difficult for Americans even to perceive the 'somatic' side of the body image as imagery. He notes that in his research, for purposes of cultural intelligibility, I necessarily asked about visual images , and physical sensations. My decision was in response to the [ . . . ] North American ethnopsychology of mind-body or men- tal-material relations that presumes all imagery to be "mental imagery". I anticipated, quite rightly, I think, that this ethnopsychology is so deeply incul- cated that somatic images are quite likely not to be recognized as such, but to be both described and ex- perienced as sensations (1997: 87). Csordas's primary theoretical innovation here is the 'so- matic mode of attention,' a concept most fully developed in a 1993 article (reprinted in Csordas 2002: 241-259). In that article he presents the concept in relation to Mer- leau-Ponty and Bourdieu. He argues that each slips away in one direction or another. In Merleau-Ponty's case, the privileging of the individual human being's ideally tran- scendent encounter with indeterminacy of existence means that the linguistic, cultural and social figure primarily as a sedimentation and rigidification of experience. In Bour- dieu's, indeterminacy is logical rather than existential. This logical indeterminacy leads to the possibility of im- provisation and change on the basis of the pre-given dis- positions of the habitus, but the individual largely van- ishes from the picture; 'textuality' dominates (Csordas 2002: 256-8). Csordas's answer, and it is surely going in the right di- rection, is to insist on a dialogue between embodiment and textuality; 'Although the habitus bears some of the schematism of a fixed text, it can be transcended in em- bodied existence' (2002: 258). This transcendence is what happens in charismatic healing, since the supplicant in ef- fect is enabled by the ritual to break the bonds of an es- tablished text. Csordas's model thus becomes rather that of an equilibrium (the established habitus) punctuated by moments of transcendence, a picture somewhat similar to that of Victor Turner's ritual process (Turner 1969) or, in a different sphere, Thomas Kuhns scientific revolution (1970). One might say that logical and existential inde- terminacy both get their turn, but not at the same time. In my own work I have taken a different line, based on a conceptual vocabulary of 'modal states' that are states both of individual and group, and can be read in both mental and bodily terms. Both individuals and groups have a repertoire of such states (in effect, the same states that can be 'read' at individual and group levels), and the repertoire changes gradually over time in both cases</page><page sequence="8">14 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 24 (2) 2010 (Samuel 1990). This is a more complex model than Csor- das 's, in part because it is working across two dichotomies, individual-group and body-mind. Arguably, though, it is a more realistic one, since it sees the process of ritual heal- ing less as a breakthrough from ordinary existence than as an intensification of processes that are basic to everyday life and that manifest in many other contexts (for exam- ple, in play in childhood, and in adult creativity). In the present context, for simplicity, I will present a less complex analysis that will nevertheless suggest some of what the multi-modal framework is intended to do. My central concept here is that of the body image. The body image in my present usage is intended explicitly as a concept that does not assume a mind-body dichotomy; as with Csordas, sensation (the somatic image) can be recognized as an integral part of the body image. Thus we can say that human beings typically experience them- selves as 'having' a body and as interacting with the world in such a way that their experience is related back to an image of the body which they 'inhabit'. If we see an ob- ject in front of us, for example, we perceive that object in a spatial relationship to our subjectively-experienced three- dimensional body image; if we touch a hot object, we per- ceive heat in the relevant point of the body image. This process ('homuncular vision,' in the terminology of Alex Comfort, 1979: 27-32), is much less obvious and straight- forward than it might seem. Clearly, some extremely com- plex and sophisticated processing is required to relate human sensory input to our perceived body image. In ad- dition, while some of this image is doubtless generated by sensory input relating to internal processes of the body, a large part of the image refers to our interaction with the external world. This is what Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guat- tari referred to, following Antonin Artaud, as the 'body without organs,' a kind of boundary surface between what we experience as ourselves and what we experience as the external world (Deleuze and Guattari 1984; Samuel 2002). It is worth noting that, as Gregory Bateson pointed out many years ago, a very large part of this process, is, and probably has to be, unconscious (1973: 107-111). Much of the richness of the sensory data we receive, both that referring directly to our bodies and that referring to other parts of the universe, necessarily has to be filtered out to simplify the picture to a point at which we can han- dle the amount of information involved. Our conscious body image may shift substantially from moment to mo- ment, depending on which parts of the picture are in our conscious awareness; yet we remain, for the most part, aware of ourselves as a continuing self that retains its iden- tity from moment to moment. The precise nature of the body image, its boundaries and the relationships that we assume between it and other entities, may vary considerably between individuals and is built up on the basis of both cultural and biological as- pects.10 The modal-state language provides a more de- tailed account of how one might describe such processes (Samuel 1990). Here I shall simply take it as read that such a concept can be postulated in a way that does not assume a reduction to either physics or psychology. If we turn now to how we experience the body image over time, we could say that our experience of ourselves forms a kind of ongoing narrative, in which we are a cen- tral actor, interacting with other figures within the story.11 Some of these figures, including but not restricted to other human beings, have person-like qualities.12 We experience the ongoing transformations of our subjective experience as resulting, in part at least, from the events of this nar- rative. We feel cold, hungry, happy, angry, and we un- derstand these feelings (while awake and conscious, and also in dreams) in terms of our ongoing internal narra- tive. Evidently, this narrative is deeply intertwined with our body physiology, a relationship that, as Varela and Depraz noted, can be assumed to go both ways: Many will accept that the self is an emergent prop- erty arising from a neural/bodily base. However [ . . . ] the reverse statement is typically missed. If the neural components and circuits act as local agents that can emergently give rise to a self, then it follows that this global level, the self, has direct efficacious actions over the local components. It is a two-way street: the local components give rise to this emergent mind, but, vice versa, the emergent mind constrains and affects directly these local components (Varela and Depraz 2003: 214). More specifically, the self (or the body image, in the lan- guage I am using here) is constantly defined, and defines itself, in terms of interactions with other postulated be- ings, human, animal or supernatural. This is probably a basic part of how human beings operate, a point which I made at the start of the paper in relation to Foster's cat- egory of personalistic disease aetiologies. Varela and Depraz's perspective, like those of Bateson and of Deleuze and Guattari, is essentially one of mind- body unity, not of mind-body interaction. Self and neu- ral/bodily base, to use Varela and Depraz's terms, do not so much affect each other as represent different levels of analysis of the same unitary phenomenon. Conscious- ness (including cognition) arises through the biological development of the organism and is part of how human beings operate as biological organisms (cf Maturana and Varela 1980). Mind and body can thus be seen as differ- ent aspects of the same unitary process, at which point mind-body interaction is no longer some kind of logical</page><page sequence="9">JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 24 (2) 201 0 15 paradox, but a simple question, which should be at least in part amenable to experimental investigation, of the na- ture of the emergent structure of self and the ways in which it might entrain and allow access to the lower-level processes of the neural/bodily base.13 If we return to the personalistic-naturalistic distinction, we can now see these as different ways of thinking about and operating with one's own mind-body complex, and with those of others: one, the personalistic, essentially based on the inner narrative through which we largely perceive our existence in the world, the other through the relatively objectifying aspect of sensory perception in which we view (and hear, smell, feel and taste) the world as an external field upon which we act. Different individuals learn to ma- nipulate, work with and combine these contrasting ap- proaches in specific ways in the course of their own process and growth. This, of course, occurs within a cultural set- ting that highlights or discourages particular aspects of this process: encouraging awareness and interpretation of dreams, for example, or presenting certain kinds of mod- els of moral interpretation of people's actions (e.g. honour and shame). Each of us then acquires a somewhat differ- ent personal 'language' in which our narrative of our in- teraction with the world is conceived. It is worth bearing in mind that these languages are bound to be very partial: If, as we must believe, the total mind is an inte- grated network (of propositions, images, processes, neural pathology or what have you - according to what scientific language you prefer to use), and if the content of consciousness is only a sampling of different parts and localities in this network; then, inevitably, the conscious view of the network as a whole is a monstrous denial of the integration of that whole. From the cutting of consciousness, what appears above the surface is arcs of circuits in- stead of either the complete circuits or the larger complete circuits of circuits. What the unaided consciousness (unaided by art, dreams and the like) can never appreciate is the systemic nature of mind (Bateson 1973: 118; italics in original). Yet healing, inevitably, is a healing of the system as a whole, which is, perhaps, one of the reasons for the ap- parently paradoxical and even illogical nature of what is provided to the sick individual by a healing ritual. Elsewhere I have suggested that vocabularies such as those of gods and spirits can function precisely as a lan- guage of states of the system, rather than as partial el- ements of the system (Samuel 1990). Spirits, in other words, may be taken as representative of particular states of the system as a whole, associated with specific modes of action and feeling. This enables us to see the language of the spirits as a way to rebalance organismic func- tioning in relation to various kinds of physiological stress, a rebalancing which may be seen as contributing directly to organismic healing at a physiological (mate- rial) level, rather than operating in purely 'psychologi- cal' terms. Where, though, does this get us in terms of the effi- cacy of rituals? I will present a simple case, that of a class of Tibetan healing practices (the so-called ts'edrup or (long) life realization rituals) in which the central process consists of the practitioner identifying himself or herself with a healing deity (cf Samuel 2005: 235-241). The prin- cipal deity is calm, self-controlled, healthy and above all protected from harmful incursions of the external world. The visualization is structured by a liturgy in which a cen- tral component is the repetition of the mantra of the deity, the verbal formula through whom he or she is evoked. The surrounding world is seen as transformed into the mandala or palace of the deity. All beings become either transforms of the Buddha's enlightened consciousness (as is the healing deity with whom the practitioner identi- fies), or inferior malevolent entities totally subservient to the healing deity and his or her entourage (Samuel 2008). These ts'edrup rituals involve a number of standard se- quences. Typically, they include one in which the princi- pal deity or deities generates healing and life-restoring nec- tar which pervades the practitioner's body, and one in which a series of secondary deities is sent out into the surround- ing universe to recover one's depleted energy, vitality and long life from the external world in which it has become lost. These are often combined with specific breathing prac- tices. Another common sequence involves the building of elaborate protective barriers to protect one from further loss of life-energy and/or assault by hostile supernaturais. Here the operation of the ritual on the body image is clear and straightforward, involving the transformation of the body image into the healthy, vital and enlightened being of the central deity. We notice however that the process also involves surrounding beings and places, and that a narrative, albeit a highly formalized one, is being constructed according to which they play supporting roles in the dramatic action of the ritual. We also notice that a relationship with spirit-entities (specifically, the heal- ing deity) is basic to the process.14 A closely related Tibetan healing ritual, the ts'ewang or (long) life empowerment, contains many of the same features, but differs in one important aspect. Here the person whose health is being restored is distinct from the person performing the ritual. In the ts'ewang , the lama, in some cases with a group of assistants, invokes himself or herself as the deity, and then transfers the healing power of the deity to one or more recipients, up to sev-</page><page sequence="10">1 6 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 24 (2) 201 0 eral hundred in a large public empowerment such as might be annually performed as part of a monastic fes- tival for the local community. Here, from the point of view of the recipient of healing, the transaction is an es- sentially dyadic one, with healing being conveyed from the lama to the recipient, and the focus is generally on a series of consecrated substances (liquids and pills) that are thought of as conveying the blessing. Depending on the recipient's level of knowledge regarding the process, he or she may also be aware of the implied interactions with the outside universe, the recovery of lost life-force, and so on. The ts'ewang is closer to the conventional model of a healing ritual, in which one person (the shaman, healer, curandero , etc) heals another through ritual action. It also bears a strong resemblance to the placebo model, in that a central element is the giving and consuming of 'medi- cinal' substances, liquids and pills. By contrast with the biomedical situation, however, the liquids and pills ( rilbu ) are not regarded as pharmacologically active.15 The effect is held to result not primarily from the substances con- tained within the pill, but from the power of the blessing {jinlap) that they convey. In other words, Tibetan theorizations of healing rit- ual could be seen as focusing, in biomedical terms, on how to get an effective placebo effect. This is germane to the point I am making here, since one could see the structure and detail of these rituals as ensuring in as dra- matic a way as possible that the recipient feels himself or herself to be at the receiving end of a transfer of pow- erful healing energy from the deity via the lama. One should be careful though of seeing this as a 'break- through' such as Csordas postulates for his charismatic healing. Particularly in the case of the ts'edrup , the prac- tice performed for oneself, the process might be less that of sudden breakthrough than constant repetition lead- ing to progressive change, as positive and 'healthy' as- pects of the body image come to predominate.16 The same can be said of the ts'ewang , since the healing ritual is ex- perienced within a social and cultural milieu in which the channeling of healing and protective power by the lamas is an everyday given. Much of the dramatic structure of healing rituals in other cultures can be seen in similar terms, as setting up a personal narrative for the person being healed such that harmful beings are displaced, extruded and destroyed, and relations with positive and healing beings put in their place. As Carol Laderman has noted, it is not too critical whether all the details of these processes are followed by the patient; what is important is that he or she is pro- vided with enough healing imagery to construct an ef- fective personal narrative of healing (Laderman 1987). One could say the same in the Tibetan case. Even with the ts'edrup or personal longevity practice, where the practitioner is performing the practice on his or her own behalf and is likely to have repeated the condensed ver- sion of the practice text many hundreds of times, one could probably place too much emphasis on the exact details of the visualization and recitation. This in any case includes a considerable amount of redundancy; one's health is restored through visualized nectars, breathing exercises, and empowered pills, and a whole series of deities is typically invoked in turn to recover lost life- force and energy from the environment. In fact, the pre- cise terms used to refer to energy, vitality, long life, and so forth, vary from text to text, and my impression is that they do not necessarily reference clearly-distin- guished aspects of the individual's inner life. The point is rather, as with Laderman's Malay healing ritual, that the individual is presented with a rich field of imagery and symbolism with which to construct an internal nar- rative of restoration and healing, built from imagery which reiterates messages of wholeness and integration (Samuel 2008). Such a narrative is in fact almost by definition going to be a compound of what the lama, shaman or healer provides, and the contribution of the person being healed. In fact this is necessary if it is going to work, since the person being healed has to integrate the struc- ture of the ritual into his or her personal life-narrative, with its own individual elements deriving from his or her actual personal history, age, gender, physical condi- tion and social role. The key issue here though is that, as Varela and De- praz notes, we have a two-way street, so that this on- going work of the narrative of the self, within which the spirits become key personalities, both can and does feed directly into physiological aspects of the person concerned. This is not, of course, to say that the body or brain are infinitely malleable,17 but if the street were not two-way, we would not have a placebo effect in the first place. Thus I return to the question I posed in relation to Kleinman's inability to explain why the tâng-ki' s meth- ods are effective. I suggest that we can go further, that we can treat the spirits as having a more focused and specific action than that of a generalised placebo, and as operat- ing at both psychological and physiological levels, which are ultimately not really distinct from each other. To do this, however, we need to take the language of spirits, of magic, sorcery and ritual healing more seriously; not in terms of occult forces, but as providing tokens and im- ages for operating on the structure of human life at all levels, within a framework which does not dichotomise</page><page sequence="11">JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 24 (2) 201 0 17 between mind and body. Elsewhere I have suggested in more detail how we might develop a language for ana- lyzing such processes (Samuel 1990, 2006b). In the pres- ent context, I simply conclude by suggesting that if we are to understand the pluralistic healing situations char- acteristic of contemporary societies, and the ways in which the spirits act to convey both healing and destruction, the avenue of research sketched here is well worth exploring further. Endnotes 1. I would like to thank Prof. William Sax for the invitation to Heidelberg that led to the writing of this article, and also Cathy Cantwell and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on an earlier version. 2. Biomedicine is a broad term, and can include a variety of medical practices and explanatory models, including some that incorporate personalistic elements (e.g. psychosomatic illness at- tributed to stressful social relationships). Here, and throughout this article, references to biomedicine imply the central proce- dures and explanatory structures of biomedical science, which explain illness in terms of materialist models of physiological malfunction. 3. The dominant current approach to this opposition in British anthropology remains that of the cognitive anthropologists (Sper- ber 1975, 1985; Boyer 1996, Boyer and Ramble 2001), who tend to treat 'mystical' or 'ritual' elements as isolated 'counterintuitive' islands within an overall logical framework, resulting from spe- cific cognitive processes that highlight and maintain such elements. I present some arguments against this mode of analysis in Samuel 1990. Such cognitive accounts drastically understate the extent to which all our thinking is pervaded by non-rational (moral-ethical, emotional) aspects. The assumption that non- rational elements structure rational thought, rather than being isolated elements within a rational frame, effectively underlies much of what follows below. Indeed, were non-rational thinking to be as limited in its implications as the cognitive anthropologists suggest, it is difficult to see how it could have the dramatic therapeutic effects which it demonstrably has. See also Deeley 2006, which argues for a 'schema-based' approach to belief as against Sperber and Boyer's approach. 4. Adler and Hammett's theory of the placebo effect is based on similar assumptions (Adler and Hammett 1973, and see below). 5. For further comments, see Samuel 1990: 17-23. 6. As Sax has pointed out, the notion of 'complex agency' im- plied by spirit action is not necessarily philosophically problem- atic, and can be easily be made sense of within realist and materi- alist accounts. The problem would seem to have more to do with the a priori assumptions of biomedicine than with any 'unscien- tific' aspects of the spirit hypothesis (Sax 2002). 7. "I" in the paper refers to Kleinman, as he notes at 1979: 25 n.l. Sung, his research assistant, undertook much of the research but was not involved in writing the paper. 8. In fact, most of Csordas's work is concerned with the heal- ing of 'psychological' rather than physical disorders. 9. For an accessible recent summary of work on neuroplastic- ity, see Doidge 2007. As the growing fields of neuroimmunology and neuroendrocrinology indicate, anything that can lead to change in the neural system has potentially very wide implications. 10. Thus, for example, a pre-modern Australian Aboriginal 'self might include aspects of the landscape and of 'totemie' species within it as an integral part (Samuel 1990: 101-2). The 'self of a modern Western city-dweller would be less likely to. 11. In terms of the modal-state framework, this narrative can also be read in terms of the ongoing interplay and transformation of the modal-state repertoire as manifested or realized through a particular individual (Samuel 1990). 12. Here I am referring to the experience of a mature adult. Clearly there is a process of growth and learning through which a child comes to understand the world in this way. Clearly, too, there are significant individual and cultural differences. A pre-modern Australian Aboriginal might find it natural to incorporate aspects of the landscape and of 'totemie' species as having such person-like qualities (Samuel 1990: 101-2). A modern Western city- dweller might be more likely to construct such relationships with TV or other media personalities, or perhaps with a car or other signifi- cant technological product. 13. The approach of these authors might be broadly termed Bergsonist, in the sense used by Sean Watson (Watson 1998). The critical point however is the need for a theoretical language within which mind and body are part of the same field, rather than as sep- arate entities dealt with by incompatible languages. 14. Cathy Cantwell notes that the key process here is identifica- tion with the deity and the development of the experience that the pure being is actually one's own nature. Thus practitioners see them- selves as recovering their own inherent purity. Here as in other Tantric rituals the attainment of 'this-worldly' ends is closely inte- grated with the dominant narrative of the attainment of enlighten- ment (personal communication, May 2008). In fact similar rituals might be used, with different deities, for other this-worldly ends, such as to evoke good fortune, wealth, or the destruction of malev- olent forces. 15. As opposed to other kinds of pills (also ril bu) used in Ti- betan medical contexts, which contain herbal, animal and mineral substances generally held to be pharmacologically active inde- pendent of whether they are ritually empowered. The contents of the long-life rilbu (ts'eril) do however contain a variety of sub- stances regarded as natural essences (honey, yoghurt, etc) and so as contributing to the effect of the ts'ewang (Cathy Cantwell, per- sonal communication, May 2008). 16. In terms of the modal-state framework, this could be seen as the construction and progressive intensification of a specific modal state or set of states. At a certain point, they might come to dominate, leading to a sense of 'breakthrough,' but much of the progress is gradual. In fact, Tibetan Buddhism uses vocabularies of sudden as well as gradual change, though these apply mainly to the context of enlightenment. I have provided some discussion of these issues, which go well beyond the scope of the present article, elsewhere (Samuel 1990, 1993). 17. Though, as noted earlier, work on neuroplasticity has made it clear that even the adult brain is capable of considerable reshaping and reconstruction (Doidge 2007).</page><page sequence="12">1 8 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 24 (2) 201 0 References Adams, Vincanne 2002 Randomized Controlled Crime: Postcolonial Sciences in Alternative Medicine Research.
