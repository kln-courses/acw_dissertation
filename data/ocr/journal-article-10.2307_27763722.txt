<plain_text><page sequence="1">LITSA CHATZIVASILEIOU Rereading Rayuela: Hypergraphy, Hermaphrodism, and Schizophrenia Este art?culo es un an?lisis de la teor?a de lectura y escritura que propone Rayuela. Primero, critica y desconstruye las teor?as mis?ginas de lectura que aparentemente postula la novela y se enfoca en aspectos estructurales que evocan a un lector "hermafrodita," t?rmino que definimos en nuestro an?lisis. Fragmentado ya el g?nero del lector, su subjetividad y racionalidad tambi?n se pulverizan y se hacen esquizofr?nicas. Se reconoce en Oliveira, pues, la figura "del lector" esquizoide, err?tico, n?mada, un "misreader" irreverente a categor?as fijas (inclusive la categor?a de lector/a), aficcionado a peripecias y viajes literales o literarios en un constante cruzar de fronteras petrificadas. Es una figura de lector excesivo, incapaz de reconocerse a s? mismo. Esta interpretaci?n nos dirige a la consideraci?n de una "escritura" hiperb?lica que llamamos hipergraf?a: a) en el sentido de la escritura discontinua, no lineal, incongruente, a trav?s de la cual se puede relacionar a Rayuela con el hipertexto (sin confluir?a con ello); b) en el sentido de una hip er escritura como exceso, interrupci?n o s?ncopa de las categor?as, oposiciones y jerarqu?as problem?ticas que la novela parece establecer. Yo creo que Rayuela es un libro machista ... Es el momento de hacer la verdadera autocr?tica, porque cuando empec? a recibir una correspondencia muy nutrida con respecto a Rayuela descubr? que una gran mayor?a de lectores eran mujeres, y eran mujeres que hab?an le?do Rayuela con un gran sentido cr?tico, atac?ndola o apoy?ndola o aprob?ndola pero de ninguna manera en una actitud pasiva, con una actitud de "lector hembra": es decir, que eran lectoras pero no ten?an nada de hembras en el sentido peyorativo que el macho tradicional le da a la palabra hembra. (Julio Cort?zar)1 In these words, long after Payuelas publication, Cort?zar himself criticized his gender discriminating theory of reading. If we were to read Cort?zar's Rayuela (1967)2 and its misogynist politics blatantly disguised under the excuse of a reading theory, we would perhaps start by lending an ear to its gagged and mute other, the female reader. We would go over its "fachada" (a metaphor Cort?zar's REVISTA CANADIENSE DE ESTUDIOS HISP?NICOS Vol XXV, 3 Primavera 2001</page><page sequence="2">398 narrator employs to imply its cursoriness and frivolity [408]) meticulously incising it and extracting from it the Platonic metaphysics - or Occidental beliefs ironically alluded to in the text as "patafisica ' (20) - which Cort?zar, through Morelli, painstakingly attempts to assault through his male (good) reader. We would cite Noakes' "On the Superficiality of Women": [Plato] presents the author as male, implanting the seed, which is his thought, into the reader, presented as female. The father-author inscribes in her a conceptus, "that which is conceived," a concept. The mother-reader who reproduces the image of the father author ... is ... a good reader. If, however, she does not reproduce an image that closely resembles the author-father's thought, she is a threat to society ... The concept to which such a mother-ra/sreader gives rise will always be a bastard concept of [an unknown origin] ... brought about by the mother-reader's misbehaviour. (345) Readers who read the text "correctly" according to Noakes could be called "male readers." On the other hand: "readers who use their wombs to threaten tradition by giving birth out of the text to concepts alien to the author can be said ... to misread the text." Resulting from a female attempt to play a male role, they are consequently monstrous because of their lack of proper paternity (345-46). Shattering the Western World's petrified novel, Cort?zar creates an incongruous, antinovelistic, incoherent, unsystematic, discontinuous and "daemonic narrative" - the latter for his female reader - in which his male reader (his semblable, his fr?re) is called to be "un camarada de camino," "un copart?ci pe" y "un copadeciente de la experiencia por la que pasa el novelista, en el mismo momento y en la misma forma ... s?lo vale la materia en gestaci?n" (407). If we were to critique Cort?zar's male-reading theory we would bisect his fr?re (or perhaps the reader as a figure of a womb in gestation) and would accuse Cort?zar of Platonic metaphysics. We would understand his conceptus, albeit monstrous and (as he would have us believe) anti-Occidental, as inseminated in, and reproduced (read "correctly") by his male readers. Nevertheless, we shall refuse to fall into Cort?zar's binary trap of male good readers and female bad readers, or vice versa. As Noakes suggests, the "opposition between the reader engaged in the text and the reader who desires to enjoy the text's surface is a false one. All readers partake of both kinds of activity" (353). We shall reject Cort?zar's dialectic trap of attentive, profound, male reading and superficial female reading, not by taking for granted Cort?zar's prescriptions (which are not, of course, directed to his female readers, pre-conceived as such, or coded as shallow, incapable of understanding and stupid), but by looking closely at a few structural traits of the novel we shall identify shortly. In this sense, the structure of the text itself shall supply us with its own means for the self-deconstruction of the categories (male reader, female reader) it establishes.3 We shall disavow Cort?zar's dichotomic reading formulas precisely because his</page><page sequence="3">399 gender based distinction of readership grounds itself on the following assump tions (Platonic, metaphysical and phallocentric, in essence): 1) that there exists a possible readership defined in biological, oppositional terms (male/female); and 2) that because one reads in the first place as a male, it follows that he reads the text well (that is, "el lector macho pene-tra)4 while if one reads as a female it follows that she reads passively and superficially (that is, "el lector hembra es pene-trade* por el autor" - passive voice here being the best verbal mood to describe authorial or authoritarian, virile potency).5 However, one can argue, as Cynthia Stone does, that "el lector c?mplice o macho y el lector hembra ... son idealizaciones que no corresponden ni al lector real (de carne y hueso) ni al lector impl?cito" (Stone 181). One thus manages to ignore the problem by pushing it out of sight and confining the male/female dichotomy of readership to a mere "idealization." Often, this so-called idealized reader as male or female is surrounded by quotation marks, which function as safeguards, warning us not to take literally (seriously?) the reader's maleness or femaleness. To ask some perhaps shocking questions that indicate how problematic the theory of "idealization" can be: What would a child reader, with or without quotation marks, be for Rayuela7. What would indigenous people or black readers be for Stone? Would they be good or bad readers? Can there be at all ideal or real readers, within or outside quotation marks, constructed on the base of race, sex, sexuality, age, class, etc.? And if for some critics the answer is yes, what can these remarks lead Stone to conclude? Perhaps, for example, that some races, within or outside quotation marks, can read better than others? This pushing of the problem out of sight also implies that if Cort?zar appears to theorize reading by relying on erroneous and at the very least doubtful presuppositions and sexual or sexist categories, he did not really mean it. He was only describing idealizations and not real or implicit readers. When Lacan said the Phallus he did not really mean the real thing, as Cort?zar did not endow his male reader with "carne y hueso" or with a penis. Even if Cort?zar did not have in mind real readers, there are questionable phallocentric, cultural representa tions hidden under such dichotomy of ("idealized" according to Stone) male versus female reader that equates masculinity with good, correct, active (indeed, penetrative, phallic) reading and exegesis and femininity with passive, incorrect, playful, frivolous and superfluous reading.6 It is at this point that we wish to state that we cannot bypass (by deferring them or naming them as something else) Rayuelds dubious and suspect phallologocentric assumptions supplying its reading theory. Neither can we, however, invert Cort?zar's binary in order to replace the privileged position of its male reader with that of the repressed "lector hembra." This is what, for example, Hardin does: "To pre-empt Cort?zar's expectations of us merely requires us to read in the one way which he does not expect us to read, as the female reader" (66). Of course, Cort?zar must have already expected, in fact,</page><page sequence="4">400 included the possibility of the female reading which Hardin exalts, since Cort?zar had anticipated it already in Rayuela through a direct reference to the female reader. Cort?zar expects both male and female reading and this is why he prescribes them both in the first place. For Hardin, male readers are the "losers" (58; his choice of words) and the female readers the winners of Rayuelds reading game: "We cannot assume that we, as critical or 'male readers, will always be the winning readers. We have only to look within Hopscotch to see that the winning readers are not the male-readers, but the existential female-readers, La [sic] Maga and Talita" (Hardin 68).7 A mere inversion of the reading dichotomy, where "el lector hembra" now has the upper hand does not solve the hierarchical problem, but rather repeats and consolidates the hierarchy as a mode of exclusion and displacement: now it is the female which is the privileged term and the male which is displaced. What we are interested in is not the substitution of one hierarchy with another, but rather its deconstruction and transcendence. In order to do so, we shall attempt to move beyond both the criticism that confronts Rayuelds gender discrimina tion on the basis of an "idealized" readership and the criticism that proposes to re-establish it by adopting an inverse position. Because Rayuela is an extensive (and in our opinion) extremely rich literary work, it is impossible to do any justice to it in a few pages. We feel that we are touching very briefly upon it and merely offering a suggestion. Be that as it may, our proposition works in two directions: 1) It exceeds the dialectic categories of readership conceptualizing the act of reading and of writing in terms of perpetual erring, fragmenting, splitting, suspending, citing (where "to cite in writing" and "to cite one and the reader in places" are not entirely different from each other, as we shall see) through which the reader's identity must be itself dispersed, shattered like the reading fragment, suspended, undecidable, playful (hermaphroditic) and errant. To the split and schizoid person, personality, character, indeed "personaje," reader and reader as character, human, etc., shall correspond the split sex or hermaphrodism, understanding it as an indeterminate "category" beyond the human sex, where sexual traits and identities playfully blur. Because this interpretation is guided by excess where (male or female) reader, character, or writing itself are not what they seem, that is, they are over and above what the novel (and its criticism so far) wishes to establish as essentialist norms or as "normal," we can say that our "deconstructive" reading flirts with the "hyper" or with hyperbole. In general terms, our rereading is governed by exorbitance: although it starts from Rayuelds own premises (it takes them "seriously," to use the novel's words), it does so only to overrun them and create what for Rayuela would be the most exorbitant, the most "daemonic" misconception, an unsettling monstrosity unable to fit into Rayuelds own dialectical imperatives. Thus the schizophrenic reader, which is as impossible to arrest and define as the author itself, is in a</page><page sequence="5">401 sense a hyperreader and its sex a hypersex. Similarly, the disseminative writing, in whose cracks, syncopations, suspensions, repetitions such a reader finds itself suspended, disoriented and hanging unfixed over it as if over an abyss, becomes itself a hyperwriting or hypergraphy. This is our n?ologie concatenation of two Greek words: "hyper" insinuates the excessive and "graphy" is writing. This writing exceeds itself by escaping its own definition (for instance, it is neither a feminine nor a masculine writing, homosexual or heterosexual, novelistic or comic, etc.) that will fix it within dialectical norms, or will assign to it an essence. While crossing more than once, explicitly or implicitly, the path of priceless and insightful traditional criticism that has identified Rayuelds writing in terms of fragmentation, we wish to take this criticism a step further. We do so in order to suggest that the writing we designate here as hypergraphy harbours within itself its own self-effacement or self-exceeding and thus through this "hyper" we also imply such writing's over-coming of itself, erring beyond its own self, "transver sing" itself, syncopating or differing itself. Hypergraphy therefore intentionally recalls a hypertextual mode of writing (while not being quite it) between (and beyond) print and machine culture. 2) For provisional and strategic reasons our reading of Rayuela has Oliveira become a hyperreader (schizophrenic and hermaphroditic, for example). This choice, which seems to privilege once more "el lector macho" and to repeat Rayuelds exclusions of the feminine, is methodologically deliberate. If one wishes to displace Rayuelds hierarchy of readership one must start with what Rayuela appears to favour (the male reader) in order to subsequently undermine the dichotomy from within, and strip its superior category precisely from its privileges. For to undermine the male reader is indeed to over-come him, syncopate him, transform him into something else, something other than himself (a bit feminine and Aphroditic, but not quite), a sexual hyperbole, a schizoid nomad no longer capable of recognizing himself-as-male (or female), no longer able to recognize himself as the unique and irreplaceable, favoured and exclusive reader of the novel. As for our rereading of Rayuela, it is perhaps located between reading seriously and enjoying the text, a game that plays Rayuelds dialectic readership against its own odds without losers or winners. REREADING ... SYNCOPATING If "no hay mensaje, hay mensajeros y eso es el mensaje," we shall read Rayuela, impersonating the playful trickster, the messenger Hermes, "que hay que ... dejarlo que juegue" (542). Contrary to Cort?zar's or Morelli's sexual fantasies and wishful thinking we shall argue that the text itself invites another type of reader. The text substantializes a schizophrenic, hermaphroditic reader via its discursive mechanisms of fragmentation, its structural and chaotic incongruity, its mania with annexation of disparate texts and discourses, discontinuous semantic blocks and symbolic topoi, its insistence on "provisional patchwork"</page><page sequence="6">402 and linguistic "babelism" (Yurkievich "Prefiguraci?n" 120,121), its infatuation with improvisation, mimetic of jazz pieces, its tendency to "misstatement," "incompleteness" ("falencia") and estrangement ("extra?amiento") (Castro Klar?n 146, 147), its textual syncopations and errancies. Such mechanisms manifest the hypergraphic character of Rayuela.8 Morphologically speaking, the narrative is constituted through three discursive modes: 1) Incoherent chapter assemblage - derisive of traditional book fragmentation (the novel's chapters being designated here as "arquepitulos" and "capetipos") - which according to a narrator assures the multiplicity and duplicity of the book (see, for instance, Rayuelds Introduction). 2) Textual spatio-temporal vagrancy (as in Chapter 23, notoriously mobilized by Horacio's wandering and encounter with Berthe Tr?pat) and intrusion of disparate, foreign texts in the "main" narrative block, varying from the shockingly abrupt (as in Chapter 34's interpolation of Gald?s' novel Lo prohibido between the lines of Oliveira's "free running interior monologue" [Percival 253]);9 to smooth (as in numerous chapters abounding in visual, acoustic and literary texts); chaotic and incohesive irruptions of newspaper clips, literary and artistic fragments, announcements, quoted material, Morellian notes, tango and jazz lyrics; infinitesimal scissions, partitions and unfolding of text into excessive footnoting which links and leads to other multiple "subtexts" destroying the pseudo-dichotomy between text and its sub- and inter-texts. This is suggestive of discursive limitlessness (as, for instance, Chapter 95, in which the Morellian theory on narrative spurs a series of footnoted commentaries, the one uncoiling another and caught between links of gradually increasing asterisks). 3) Xenoglossia, confined to Western languages and ranging from French to English, to, less frequently, German; linguistic alophonia, exemplified in the erotic "gliglica" and analogous to the novel's structural dis-function and dis coherence; "cacography" and "dysglossia" (as in Horacio's attaching his initial to his thoughts); and "unorthographies," parodie lexical deformations (as in "toponom?a," "anatolog?a," "descriptol?gica," "corri?comounreguerodep?lvora," etc). The above three analytical categories of Rayuelds textual genesis can be schematically summarized as referring to: 1) the text in relation to its chapters; 2) the text in relation to its topology and chronology as well as in relation to itself and to other texts; and 3) the text in relation to its language. We shall very briefly examine these categories in a limited number of chapters that are paradigmatic of the "hypergraphic" character of the novel. In Chapter 136 a narrator cites a narrator who quotes Morelli and who in turn quotes Batailles Haine de la po?sie. This short passage becomes a Russian doll of citation through two punctuation marks: the loquacious dots and the "biting" quotation marks which sever and release Bataille's text into Morelli's and into</page><page sequence="7">403 the narrator's and into the novel: "La man?a de las citas de Morelli: 'Me costar?a explicar la publicaci?n, en un mismo libro, de poemas y de una denegaci?n de la poes?a, del diario de un muerto y de las notas de un prelado amigo m?o Georges bataille, Haine de la po?sie" (517-18). Derrida ("Living On: Border Lines") would describe Chapter 136's operation as "a sort of overrun [d?bordement] that spoils ... [the] boundaries and divisions" of a unified narcissistic text such as endings, beginnings, signatures and margins. The text becomes instead "a differential network, a fabric of traces referring endlessly to something other than itself, to other differential traces ... The text overruns all the limits assigned to it..." (256-57). In short, the dots are here liminal points (textual edges) which cut and simultaneously multiply the text, linking and interweaving it with others in an infinite chaining of cotexts that vary between explicit and implicit. It can be argued that, as figures of partition, momentary suspension, subsequent stitching or linking of heterogenous texts, and multiplication and expansion of the text itself within itself, direct or indirect dotting and quoting are the novel's privileged modes of unravelling, or of hyperwriting. Dotting and citing (soon we shall consider "syncopating" - all three marks, at least in the terms we are describing them here, have been neglected by criticism) are two structural traits of Rayuela that put excess to work. Everything must be suspended while simultaneously recalling something else. To quote or to cite insinuate that the reader must always be cited in an-other "place" or somewhere else. Citation is an overrun or an excess: the reader must always feel out of place, deferred, displaced. Certainly, dotting is also implied at the level of "plot" and its unanswered questions, for instance, on Oliveira's Search..., la Magas fate..., Morelli's death..., the novel's beginning(s) and ending(s), and so forth. Chapters like 120 lack beginning and ending, as if recreating a kind of metaphorical decapitation or the torture, rape, etc., on the level of "plot." Dislocated from its surroundings and starting with a broken and incomplete sentence ("a la hora de la siesta todos dorm?an ..." [482]), this chapter describes "el negro" Ireneo's "bestiality," with the grub and the ants analogous to, and almost echoing, the brutality he inflicts on la Maga while raping her, as is narrated in Chapter 15, which is in turn connected to 120. The chapter's dotting, or the text's beheading of its beginning, enacts or writes physically the cruelty and violence recounted in both Chapter 15 (which includes allusions to a snuff film of hanging, Wong's account of torture in China, la Maga's description of her rape by Ireneo), and Chapter 120. While these two chapters must rely for their constitution on a number of oppositions (such as black/white, man/ woman, adult/child, Oriental/Occidental, human/insect, etc.), they must also suffer violence themselves (in particular in Chapter 120) in the form of structural syncopation or decapitation: these chapters must be suspended or beheaded at the moment when they put something at the head of an opposition. The</page><page sequence="8">404 silencing or the suppression of beginning images, the gagging of Chapter 120's mouth. Lacking precedence and sequence, this text is a flashback tale, incongru ous with earlier or subsequent events. Time is here discontinuous and dissonant with previous moments. It is indeed as strangled and syncopated as the text it weaves, as it recreates musical times of a jazz piece (like, for example, those of Benny Carter, Chu Berry, or Champion Jack Dupree, to whom the friends of "el club de la serpiente" listen while la Maga narrates Ireneo's attack on her to Gregorovius). Consider that jazz is made of improvised sounds characterized by frequent dissonant rhythms and syncopes.10 Syncope is a mode of diff?rance, a moving beyond dialectics. It is about detaining, deferment and difference, or as Cl?ment puts it: "it creates delay and accentuates it by prolonging time" (81). It is about dotting, the beheading of mastery and dialectics; it is about discord and dissonance: "Against dialectic, the poem. Against the system, the novel. Against the Everything, punctuation ... It opens up space for silence ... and leave [s] a gap for the reader's - fantasy to slip in" (Cl?ment 83). One can argue that through syncope and dotting there is a structural holding off or exceeding of any racial or sexual position or opposition that the text itself might be establishing. (Consider, for instance, in racial terms, the problematic images of Ireneo, a black man as cruel, barbaric, pervert pedophile, or rapist of a white girl, and of Wong as affiliated to the Chinese as "a race of torturers.") This exceeding is not at all problematic, for such a structure becomes a ferocious assault to a unique position, that is, the panacea of a charlatan and hypocritical anthropomorphic humanism: "Instead of commandments and principles, this ethics of writing [which one could call hyperethics] formulates questions - questions for which there are no simple dogmatic answers" (Gonz?lez 238). Even Oliveira, the novel's favourite character, or Morelli's "prodigal son," repudiates dialectics with these words: Rebeli?n, conformismo, angustia, alimentos terrestres, todas las dicotom?as: el Yin y el Yang, la contemplaci?n o la T?tigkeit, avena arrollada o perdices faisand?es, Lascaux o Mathieu, qu? hamaca de palabras, qu? dial?ctica de bolsillo con tormentas en piyama y cataclismos de living room. El solo hecho de interrogarse sobre la posible elecci?n vicia y enturbia lo elegible. Que s?, que no, que en ?sta est?... Parecer?a que una elecci?n no puede ser dial?ctica, que su planteo la empobrece, es decir la falsea, es decir la transforma en otra cosa. Entre el Yin y el Yang, ?cu?ntos eones? Del s? al no, ?cu?ntos quiz?? Todo es escritura, es decir [?{"hiperescritura"}?] f?bula. (395) The decapitated chapter is about the excess of evil, as is Chapter 15. Piling up one brutality after the other and "going as far as possible" in iniquity satiates the reader with evil to the point of excess or nausea. Dotting here becomes accumulative. Baudrillard would call the chapter's flirting with heinousness the evil's orgy after which "evil does not disappear by coming to an end, by dying.</page><page sequence="9">405 Instead it disappears through proliferation ... by becoming saturated ... because of extenuation" (4). For, "since the world," Baudrillard argues, "is on a delusional course, we must adopt a delusional standpoint towards the world. Better to die from extremes than starting from the extremities" (1). Questioning a limited world and reaching the point of madness, Bataille, in La Haine de la po?sie, discerns the world's limitlessness (111). This would become his non-anthropomorphic, acephalic universe, antidote to a pseudo-morality: "evil bursts out from the headless summit of morality, a volcanic eruption of energies without limit: the access to an 'acephalic universe" (Botting and Wilson 7).11 Rayuela, beheading Logos and its reason, strives to disparage anthropo morphy and espouse instead Morelli s "antropofan?a" (405) - not the being, but the "phenein" (resembling) of anthropos (man): an irresolute position indeed that refuses to fall prey to reason and dialectics: [Morelli] no parec?a proponerse una teor?a, no era nada fuerte para la reflexi?n intelectual, pero de todo lo que llevaba escrito se desprend?a con una eficacia infinitamente m?s grande que la de cualquier enunciado o cualquier an?lisis, la corrosi?n profunda de un mundo denunciado como falso, el ataque por acumulaci?n y no por destrucci?n, la iron?a casi diab?lica ... La moral del occidente se les aparec?a [a Oliveira y a Etienne] a esa hora como una proxeneta, insinu?ndoles una a una todas las ilusiones de treinta siglos inevitablemente heredados, asimilados y masticados ... Las alusiones de Morelli a la inversi?n de los signos, a un mundo visto con otras y desde otras dimensiones ... los exasperaba ... Si alg?n consuelo les quedaba era pensar que tambi?n Morelli se mov?a en esa misma ambig?edad, orquestrando una obra cuya leg?tima primera audici?n deb?a ser quiz? el m?s absoluto de los silencios. (525-26; my emphasis) Oliveira (logos) is pathologized, "anthropophenized," schizophrenized. He is the reader par excellence, as is made clear in Chapter 154, where Morelli asks him to assemble his writings incoherently. The text becomes "la partida infinita [de] un ajedrez indio [cuyo] centro podr?a estar en una casilla lateral, o fuera del tablero" (540). This opens the possibility of limitless interpretations and readings, decentring, playing out of edges and d?bordement. In Morelli s words, it becomes "un bolsillo de chaleco," that is, an "invaginated fold" ("the inward refolding of la gaine [sheath, girdle], the inverted reapplication of the outer edge, to the inside of a form where the outside then opens a pocket" [Derrida "Living On" 265; my emphasis]), whose centre is "overrun," "es desbordado" by "m?rgenes" and "periferias." The reader operates through mistake: it is Hermes, the trickster, the voyager ("Dec?amos que hay que pensar en Hermes, dejarlo que juegue" [542]). Oliveira, the novel's figure of the reader, is an incorrigible wanderer in all senses of wandering and digression. He is one that mis-behaves, mis-fits in fixed or dichotomic categories and moralities, misses the centre, "place," as well as the point (that is, he is mis-placed), or even mis-spells (with</page><page sequence="10">406 "gl?glica," for instance). Yurkievich sees Oliveira as the apotheosis of "miscon duct" in one of Rayuelds attempts to embrace antilogos and attack: ego- and logocentric totalitarianism ... a one-dimensional, castrating, disembodying, repressive logos, the means to correct the distorted evolution of Western thought ... Misconduct [is] thumbing one's nose at society's madness ... it consists of isolating oneself from the species ... in order to eliminate through regression any residue from false humanity. Misconduct implies unpigeonholing oneself, unlabeling oneself, declassifying oneself uncategorizing oneself removing one's strings, provoking disorder with mindlessness. ("Eros ludens" 98; my emphasis) Just as the author (Morelli) had to invert "los signos de un mundo falso," so too the reader must mis-place them, err, order the world, novelistic or not, by committing errors. As Morelli says to Oliveira, who is asked to put Morelli's "roman comique" in order: "en el peor de los casos, si se equivocan, a lo mejor queda [su libro] perfecto. Una broma de Hermes Paku ..." (542). Oliveira, "el buen (macho) lector," can mis-take, take, or read wrongly, mis-conceive and conceive bastards, views alien to the author's. Is it not true then, that here the reading invitation to Hermes is also extended to the "playful," "seductive," "superficial," and "erring" Aphrodite, to "el lector hembra" (or "hombra"), a misreader par excellence? Is it not that according to Rayuelds own premises, the disintegration of dialectics, logocentrism, pseudo-morality and anthropo morphy, also involves the playful, "diabolic inversion," subversion, destruction, "declassification," "uncategorization" (to use Yurkievich's terms), or even mis placement of binary and raisogynous sexual signs in which its readership is caught?12 Is it not that this reader, about which we are now reading, or perhaps mis-conceiving, would be itself a monstrous mis-conception? Would it not be a monstrous bastard, disobedient and misbehaving, alien indeed to Cort?zar's theoretical prescriptions or dictates of a readership based on the opposition good male reader/bad female reader and gender discrimination? Perhaps, what could be even worse for Rayuela, what perhaps would even leave Morelli (or Cort?zar) absolutely disoriented and aphonie, is a "misconcep tion" that takes Morelli's dictums seriously (and playfully at once) only to overrun or displace them all together. It is more misconceiving to think of a reader overstepping the very dichotomy of male/female reader, as well as its mere inversion, and by doing so to think of an extreme monstrosity (the absolute evil for Rayuela) with no identifiable face, body, or sex (and by extension without race, sexuality, class, etc.). What would be more diabolic than the diabolic, more catastrophic than Morelli's pseudo-destructions, is to destroy all of Rayuela s explicitly or implicitly phallocentric propositions by pretending that one agrees with them (by misconceiving, but in a different, more radical sense). What would be more "destructive" and "demonic" than ever is to refuse to perpetuate</page><page sequence="11">407 the authorial mark or seed (some might say, the Law of the Father) in all of its forms: to let the sexual opposition and the hierarchies it creates crash into broken pieces and become unable to erect themselves; to let the reader read neither with his penis nor with a vagina, with or without quotation marks. Like a trickster, this reader plays between Hermes and Aphrodite. Like the text it reads, it is a personification of "misconduct"; it is itself misformed: it is the very hypersexual malformation, or excess of essentialist categories. It cannot be recognized in either sex or essence and bears neither biological traits, such as a womb (and is ace-phallus), nor cultural labels of seriousness versus superficial ity, rationality versus irrationality (often attributed by some criticism of Rayuela to Oliveira and la Maga, respectively). This is an anti-essentialist, non-dialectical, "anthropophenic," in fact, "hermaphroditic reader" that "overruns" ("desbor da") and syncopates closural, indeed, sexual dichotomies and anthropomorphic, representations. For as Deleuze and Guattari contend, an "anthropomorphic representation is just as much the idea that there are two sexes as the idea that there is one" (294). Beyond this anthropomorphic representation there is the "nonhuman sex": "a microscopic transsexuality, resulting in the woman containing as many men as the man and the man as many women" (Deleuze and Guattari Anti-Oedipus 295-96).13 Chapters 58 and 131 deal with Oliveira's derangement triggered by his voluntary confinement in a madhouse ward, scattered with a web of strings and a pit of basins. Reader and discourse are made schizophrenic.14 Referring endlessly to each other, as if an old scratched jazz record was stuck, both chapters are related as in a palindrome. Self-obsessive, the text repeats itself. Writing is self-referential, syncopated indefinitely, fallen in its own abyss of repetition, for the writers pen is here like a damaged phonograph needle. Oliveira is confined and diagnosed with a farcical mental disorder: "hysteria matinensis yugulata" which literally translates as "morning hysteria of the throat." Nevertheless, Horacio s pathological state is not hysteria (a disease of the uterus!), but rather schizophrenia. "Before" and "after" his "internment" in the mental hospital he exhibits symptoms proper to schizophrenia: 1) distortion of reality and delusion, as in his perception of Talita as la Maga and vice versa; 2) the split between thought process and emotion, as in the episode of "thinking about" la Maga while simultaneously reading Galdos's novel; 3) fragmentation of personality in his frequent identifications with Traveler, or in dialogues such as in Chapter 58, where, tranquilized and asleep, he is still able to converse with his friends (Gekrepten, Talita, and Traveler). It might be said that Oliveira, like a true "schizophrenic passes from one code to the other, that he deliberately scrambles all codes" (Deleuze and Guattari Anti Oedipus 15), as if they were precisely a web of strings. It might be said that Oliveira is no longer Oliveira, but other than Oliveira. He would even be able to exchange sexual signs with la Maga, communicating in her non-communicating</page><page sequence="12">408 language ("gl?glica"); he would over-come himself and become her or become even a child, for it is "idiotic" and in fact impossible to rebel against the other in the self, "era idiota sublevarse contra el mundo Maga y el mundo Rocamadour" (26). Oliveira would be constantly other than himself, "transversing" and interrupting himself in the face of Emmanuele, Berthe Tr?pat, Traveler, la Maga and even in the face of the ideal reader. All these alterities, including the ideal reader of the novel (which Oliveira must become through Morelli's dictations), are not simply his dialectical doubles,15 vehicles of sublimation through which Oliveira can reclaim himself more potent than ever: they are the other within Oliveira's self and as such they refract him, split him and shatter him for ever. The fragmented and quasi-incongruous dialogue in Chapter 58 between friends and mentally ill alike (Remorino and Number 18 are also in the scene) is a projection of Oliveira's disintegrated personality. In a similar fashion, space is fractured, for from Gekrepten's indications it seems that Horacio is in their apartment, but from the points of view of Ferraguto, Remorino, Ovejero, Cuca, and Number 18, he is still in the hospital. Time is oneiric, syncopated, obsessive, split seconds of a record skipping. Language is stuttering as it strives to communicate and make sense (in fact it becomes as in-communicable as la Maga's "gl?glica"), but it remains in discontinuous pieces, babelian and chaotic. Language is dysphasic: losing its ability to speak, but only in incomplete fragments its "phren" (mind) is cleaved. For Deleuze this is the schizophrenic discourse of antilogos: "time is: the ultimate existence of parts, of different sizes and shapes, which cannot be adapted, which do not develop at the same rhythm, and which the stream of style does not sweep along at the same speed... The language of signs begins to speak for itself, reduced to the resources of disaster and deception; it no longer is supported on a subsisting Logos ..." (101). Deleuze has suggested that the modern work of art adheres to laws of fragmentation in which "the order of cosmos has collapsed, crumbling into associative chains and non-communicating viewpoints" (101). The literary work would be a production, the work of a schizoid antilogos similar to the one manifested in Rayuela: In a universe thus fragmented, there is no Logos which gathers up all the pieces, hence no law which attaches them to a whole to be regained or even formed. And yet there is a law, but with a changed nature, function and relation ... It seems that the modern conscious ness of the antilogos has made the law undergo a radical revolution ... Far from conjoining and adapting parts, it separates and partitions them ... (116-17) Antilogos is the "law" of schizoid disjunction, where the distinct parts are no longer totalizable or recognizable as parts of a whole, of "an organism, a signification, a subject (Deleuze and Guattari A Thousand Plateaus 159).16</page><page sequence="13">409 In Anti-Oedipus Deleuze and Guattari link schizophrenia with journey. Foucault, with his "Stultifera Navis," talks about the madman as an interstitial being, a traveller of literal and metaphorical navigations (Foucault 11). Yurkievich points out that "Oliveira practices interstitial vision" (99) in his constant literal and metaphoric trips of Search (for example, through Paris and its underworld). Let us remember that to navigate hypertext means to read. Oliveira and, by extension, Rayuelds reader is a perpetual traveller: consider, for example, the reader s vagrancy in disparate texts, navigations from "del lado de all?" to "de ac?" to the fragmented "de otros lados," Oliveira's nomadism and wanderings in the underworld of Paris, the constant reference to streetcars. These objects and acts would be in Deleuze's words "transversals" permitting one to see the world as the author s fragmented views, but not as a "unified landscape." "Traversais" Deleuze suggests, "cause us to leap ... from one world to another, from one word to another, without ever reducing the many to One ... but ... affirming that multiplicity without uniting all these irreducible fragments ... Travel is the transversal of the multiplicity of places ... It does not connect places, but affirms only their difference" (112-13). These transversals are "links" that manifest the hypergraphic character of Rajuela (similar but not identical to that of hypertext), understood also as a perpetual shifting of self (we call it narrative, reader, male, female, character, author, etc.) as if it were tangled within the multiplicity of a web of strings and being directed against all hierarchical fronts and structures: "Transversality must thus be understood in a tense opposition to both vertical hierarchies and horizontal structures" (Bosteels 157). Furthermore, travelling or transversing is analogous to the act of reading or interpreting "which has no other unity than a transversal one; interpreting alone is the divinity of which each thing is a fragment, but its 'divine form' neither collects nor unites the fragments, it carries them on the contrary to the highest, most acute state, preventing them from forming a whole. The 'subject' of the Search is finally no self ..." (Deleuze 114) This is Oliveira's "no self," a schizo phrenic "subject," a nomad with no fixed territory and destination, an orphan of no paternal(istic) idols and ideologies ("toda la teor?a de la comunicaci?n aniquilada, ni mam? ni pap?, ni pap? rica ni pip? ni vuf vuf ni nada," [167] ), an atheist with no beliefs and philosophies: "As for the schizo, continually wandering about, migrating here, there, and everywhere as best he can, he plunges further and further into the realm of deterritorialization, reaching the furthest limits of decomposition of the socius on the surface of his own body [and self]" (Deleuze and Guattari, Anti-Oedipus^). Oliveira sounds indeed like the schizophrenic Artaud: "7 don't believe in father, in mother, got no papamummy" (14; original emphasis). If, in the way we are here reading Oliveira, he has no "papamummy," one can fairly conclude the following: as the paternalistic figure of "el lector macho," the</page><page sequence="14">410 good reader or son of a papa-author, Oliveira is a useless reader for Morelli or for Rayuela: "And has not the reader ideally constructed ... become like Tr?pat's audience, defeated and useless?" (Larsen 62). Oliveira has rejected all "pappa mummies" and by doing so he also implicitly rejects his father and the author's (Morelli's, Cort?zar's) dictums and reading theory to the point of over-coming himself, to the point of disavowing himself (as well as his opposite: the female reader) as the idol or the ideal reader of the novel, rejecting therefore the phallocentric ideology disguised under such paternalistic constructs and reading theory.17 This reader we are speaking of is a hyperbole (it exceeds itself, or is a hyperreader). The text this reader is assigned to read (or not read), search, construct, deconstruct, and reconstruct, obeys the same law, the law of the schizoid, the nomad, the orphan, the atheist. The "Search is indeed the production of the sought-for-truth"; not some transcendental, originary and unified Truth (for "there is no truth but orders of truth, just as there are orders of production," [Deleuze 131]) or View, but like the "anthropophenic" truths that Morelli has been seeking, and which seem (phenein) to come from humans (call them Morelli, Oliveira, authors, readers, male, female), but they do not. By being productive of orders of truth, literature becomes a machine: "The modern work of art is anything it may seem: it is even its very property of being whatever we like, of having the overdetermination of whatever we like, from the moment it works: the modern work of art is a machine and functions as such" (Deleuze 128; Deleuze emphasizes only "works"). As Morelli prophesies jokingly, the future "Eden" of cybernetic technology and machines: "La raza humana sale de la edad media para ingresar en la era cibern?tica ... El reino ser? de material pl?stico, es un hecho" (392). Nevertheless, cybernetics is not just alluded to through Morelli's prognosis. His book, and by extension Rayuela, anticipate cybernetics via their structure, non-linearity, fragmentation, multiplicity of texts, schizo phrenic reader, and schizoid discourse. Rayuela s hyperwriting or hypergraphy (which also combines "writing" and hypertextuality) anticipates hypertext. In Hypertext, Landow has described electronic text, and more precisely hypertext, as a work "composed of blocks of words (or images) linked electroni cally by multiple paths, chains or trails in an open-ended, perpetually unfinished textuality described by the terms link, node, network, web, and path" (3). In this reversible text, there is neither beginning nor end but several entrances. Lacking sequence and fixed limits, hypertext is multilinear and multisequential. It uses links which connect to lexias or commentaries that are "external" to a work - a kind of footnoting of a text that is being transferred "inside" it - and by doing this it disposes of the old hierarchies between text and subtext (and intertext) or text and its margins, inside and outside boundaries. Citation, separation, and assemblage of quoted fragments are crucial to hypertext. Electronic texts elude the tyranny of a univocal voice by being distilled "from the combined experience</page><page sequence="15">411 of the momentary focus, the lexia one presently reads, and the continually forming narrative of one's reading path" (Landow 11). Hypertext privileges decentring of both reader and text. By moving through a web of texts, the reader is constantly shifting centre, narrative, and experience. One might even say that such a reader is itself postponed, or syncopated.18 This reader is always cited in some other place. ("To cite" is related to the Greek kinein: to move, to set into motion, to shift, etc. [Dormbaraki 447].) Such a reader does not find its place or centre; the reader itself is impossible to locate (sexually, racially, ontologically, and so on). It is lost in the abyss opened by the difference between interrupted "places," and consequently it does not read, or is no longer a reader. Hypertext is "an infinitely decenterable and re-centerable system" (Landow 12). As McLuhan would have argued, this de-centring and re-centring attacks "consciousness" as the mark of the Western rational and literate being: "there is nothing linear or sequential about the total field of awareness that exists in any moment of consciousness ... In Western literate society it is still plausible and acceptable to say that something 'follows' from something" (85). In hypertext, the linear, the sequential, and the rational are absent. As Derrida (Of Grammatology) suggests in a similar context: "The end of linear writing is indeed the end of the book" (Derrida 86). Texts (as well as readers, as we have argued) are fragmented. The reader can randomly control them, connect and separate them according to the reader's paths. Texts can be dispersed, that is, a commen tary can be inserted into other texts and consequently lose its physical and intellectual autonomy from other blocks. "The writer ... loses certain basic controls over his [sic] text, particularly over its edges and borders" (Landow 52), or in Morelli's words, over its "m?rgenes" and "periferias." An "intrusive reader" blurs its limits by expanding, including, excluding, linking and assembling contiguous texts to the individual work. The reader reads (or does not read) and navigates hypertext by always creating provisional structures, or by establishing what Landow, alluding to Deleuze, designates as "nomadic centers ... that are never permanent, always straying from one set of information to another" (Landow 77). Finally, hypertext calls into question the idea of narrative as fixed sequence, definite beginnings and endings, and unity or wholeness. It forms a chain of narratives that force unified settings, narrators, chronologies, subjects, and so forth, to shift (kinein, to cite). Like Borges' "forking paths," these narratives constitute a rather chaotic, labyrinthine web of directions (such as Oliveira's web of strings) of disjunct but converging or synthesized (to use Deleuze's words) blocks of reading. The similarities between hypertext and Rayuelds schizophrenic discourse are striking. Rayuela as hypergraphy dissolves time and itself into particles, decomposes wholes and orders itself into gaps, dots, or syncopes, pulverizes space into variegated "landscapes," breaks language and information into a disparity of schizoid viewpoints. From its opening lines, the novel explicitly gives</page><page sequence="16">412 us linear and non-linear instructions for reading its so-called sequences: "A su manera este libro es muchos libros, pero sobre todo es dos libros" (7). Chapter 154 implicitly calls for multilinear reading through Morelli. Hypergraphy (and indeed hypertext) is a mad, ace-phal(l)ic and schizophrenic writing formed by untotalizable, non-unified, incomplete and "dysphasic" fragments, demanding a reader that can only be like Oliveira: schizophrenic, nomadic, interrupted, mis behaving, and constantly cited or mobile. Rayuela s hypergraphy is self-damaging or self-destructive. Hypergraphy acts like a pen, phonograph needle, or a syringe stabbing Oliveira to tranquilize the reader and make his rational reading aphasie and non-communicating (misreading). It acts like a suicidal knife turned upon itself to disfigure itself like a cracked music record, the shattered acoustic mirror of infinite palindromic self-repetition. In its self-repeating, indeed like a broken record, this writing skips its self. It is itself a schizoid interruption. Perhaps, the ultimate writing and its reader (and by extension what we call an author) are a non-writing and a non-reader. Perhaps, hypergraphy as hyperbolic writing is this syncopation, over coming, suspension or transversing and exceeding oneself - what Der rida has designated more than once, "writing" as diff?rance (difference-deferral). Hypergraphy privileges textual assemblage, discontinuity between parts, celebration of peripheries and margins, and interlacing of infinite contexts and intertexts through dotting and syncopating, or through citational discourse. For Derrida this is the effect of the teeth of quotation marks, brackets, parentheses, the effect of the bite or morsel "which is always detached ... by the teeth" (Derrida Glas 118). When language is cited, the effect is that of releasing the grasp or hold of a controlling context. Rayuela syncopates in broken chapters, search, narrative sequence, threads of story, space and time by perpetual dotting, quoting, footnoting, parenthesis and incomplete episodes. It presents fragments of texts, characters and language. It establishes erring and journeying at the level of character, which wanders endlessly in disparate and indeterminate spaces and times, to reinforce the idea of a nomadic reader: "La t?cnica consist?a en citarse [Oliveira y la Maga] vagamente en un barrio a cierta hora ... De acuerdo en que en ese terreno no lo estar?an nunca, se citaban por ah? y casi siempre se encontraban" (43). This literal journey co-exists analogically with the idea of a nomadic reader "navigating" randomly through texts (the reader as Hermes, the voyager). Rayuela flirts with the margins (as Morelli argues: "Hab?a que proponerse ... un movimiento al margen de toda gracia" [488]) and the possibility of chaotic textual arrangement and production of meaning through a fragmented, indeed schizoid, reading that undermines notions of edges, limits, principles, determinations and centres. All these notions are metaphorically circumscribed in the images of the chessboard, the hopscotch, or the circle and its periphery: "Terrible tarea la de chapotear en un c?rculo cuyo centro est? en todas partes y su circunferencia en ninguna, por decirlo escol?sticamente" (491).</page><page sequence="17">413 Let us stress that the above observations on what we call hypergraphy play at two interconnected but different levels (whereby one exceeds the other). The first and perhaps most obvious and familiar level with regards to Rayuela indicates that hypergraphy is a multidimensional writing and this multidimensionality is analogous (but not identical) to the one manifested in hypertextual writing. This first level is in accordance with previous interpretations which have identified Rayuelds multiplicity not in terms of hypergraphy, but in terms of mosaic, collage, palimpsest, bricolage, collage and so on. The second level takes this multiplicity a step further and comprehends hypergraphy in a different sense.19 The multidimensionality we are speaking of through such writing (a writing which, as we have repeatedly said, is self destructive) implies that hyperwriting can escape itself. This means that hypergraphy can no longer mean "writing" in a colloquial or material sense (as graphic expression, for instance) and it cannot be conflated with hypertext, or even with Cort?zar's writing of Rayuela. This special writing does not "write" just as the hyperreader does not read. It rather interrupts anything that can close upon itself as a subjectivity (or consciousness), an ontological truth, a sexual (or any) determination, even if with such unique determinations one understands a male or female reader, an author (papa or mummy), a novel (roman comique or h?ro?que, modern or postmodern, etc.), a sex, a character, a text and so on. Therefore, hypergraphy is a pure structure of interruption, syncopation or difference of something that is construed as unique, privileged and exclusive. It is a manifestation of what Derrida calls the structure of archi-writing as difference, the suspension "of a self-presence in truth the loss of what has never taken place, of a self-presence, which has never been given but only dreamed of and always already split, repeated, incapable of appearing to itself..." (Derrida Of Grammatology 112). One can expect from this, that such hypergraphy (that does not write) will not be able to reproduce any of Rayuelds or Cort?zar's (and Morelli's) prescriptions, including those that dictate a multidimensional writing "al margen de toda gracia." Rayuela could not have been written at all; or rather it is written at the moment when it must exceed or suspend itself as a book, and in particular as "un libro machista o paternalista." Finally, the multidimensionality this hyperwriting over-comes is precisely the multidimensionality Cort?zar has asked to be performed by his good male reader. We frequently forget when we think of Rayuela as multidimensional that Rayuela itself states explicitly that access to it ("lo abierto, lo varonil," in Castellano-Gir?n s words [132]) is only restricted to the male reader, while the female reader reads "unidimensionally" ("lo cerrado, pasivo, lineal," etc.). If the multiformity or non-linearity that Cort?zar demands from his reader can only be accomplished by a singular consciousness, subject or sex (the male), then it is a spurious heterogeneity usurped by a Unique Being (the male). Beyond such a Cortazarian pseudo-multiplicity reserved only for its unique male reader, there</page><page sequence="18">414 exists hypergraphy as a "dimension" out of Rayuelds false (and sexist) multi dimension. This is precisely the "dimension" of the "hyper" or of excess,20 an excess from anything that tends to homogenize either under that which falsely appears to be heterogeneous (the male reader), or under what explicitly appears to operate in a homogeneous fashion (the female reader). Hypergraphy is an erring dimension of excess out of any form of mastery, hierarchy, and exclusion. Have we mis-read Rayuela7. Perhaps. Have we carried Cort?zar's prescriptions a little too far? His other, his refraction, Morelli, assures us of the contrary: "Se trataba de encontrar un lenguaje que no fuera literario" (539), that is, a language that exceeds the literary, and even the language of Cort?zar's or Morelli's own languages, or at least a language that does not take them for granted. Perhaps it is more appropriate to say that, by using Rayuelds own premises, this paper was our attempt to mis-carry and even abort "un libro machista" - in Cort?zar's words - or more accurately, its reading (and implicitly its writing) theory, grounded in the exclusion of the feminine other. Perhaps, we have mis diagnosed the reader's schizophrenia and shattered Oliveira as logos into pieces and detached parts, because, like the sentimental and stupid la Maga - whom Oliveira always feels compelled to educate and instruct - we have still not quite understood this book, let alone been able to read it. (Remember that none of Rayuelds female characters ever read a book, or if they read they read "clumsy" novels and "trivial encyclopedias") Perhaps we are ourselves one of the novel's female characters ("el lector hembra") that has leapt out of its pages, indignant, but more erring and playful than ever. Perhaps we are a character that reads without carrying a sexual (or any) id. The question of the subject, the question of the "who" of the reader, or of the author, is precisely what Rayuelds structure, as well as its own premises, reading themselves against themselves, seem to render irrelevant by pulverizing such subjectivities and making them hyperbolic nomads. We share this text's obsession with the fragment and the fragility of unified categories, straying from, and playing with them, wandering, transver sing, transcending and mis-placing them as the possibility of the "hyper" and the exorbitant, the only possibility for escaping their prison. University of British Columbia NOTES i Cited by Puleo in C?mo leer a Julio Cort?zar (65-66). Sanjin?s alludes to another self-criticism by Cort?zar: "Pido perd?n a las mujeres del mundo por haber utilizado una expresi?n tan machista y tan de subdesarrollo latino americano, y eso deber?as ponerlo con todas las letras de la entrevista. Lo hice con toda ingenuidad y no tengo ninguna disculpa, pero cuando empec? a</page><page sequence="19">415 escuchar las opiniones de mis amigas lectoras que me insultaban cordialmente, me di cuenta de que hab?a hecho una tonter?a. Yo deb? poner 'lector pasivo' y no 'lector hembra,' porque la hembra no tiene que ser pasiva continuamente; lo es en ciertas circumstancias, pero no en otras, lo mismo que un macho" (230). 2 All quotations are from the edition published by Alianza Editorial (1987). 3 This, however, does not preclude the possibility of taking into account (at once seriously and playfully) what Morelli or Cort?zar "tell" us about the novel. In this fashion, we also implicitly attempt to bypass another opposition (already existing within Rayuela), which we have frequently discerned in critics in their interpretations of the novel and in which either one focuses on the text's structural elements or fetishizes the author's so-called "meaning-to-say." (For a discussion of the metaphysical notion of "meaning-to-say" see Derrida's "The Voice That Keeps Silence" in Speech and Phenomena [70-87] and "The Exorbi tant. Question of Method" in Of Grammatology [57-64].) For us, it is indeed at the juncture of both the structure of the narrative and the enunciated that such interpretation must take place. 4 What are we to do here with such a ludicrous phallocentric assumption that has assigned to the text female genitals and a vaginal passivity and to the reader a phallic potency? What are we to do with such a proposition of the text as a biologically determined human being (a female) and its logical implication of reading as rape? These are not simply misogynist constructions and representa tions that one can forgive Cort?zar or dismiss as merely unimportant and unfortunate. Cort?zar should have known better although he chose to be silent. He was writing in the 50's and 6o's, at a moment when, as Larsen notes, he "did not perceive the real import or developing energy of the women's movement - arguably one of the most signal of modern 'cultural revolutions'. Cort?zar's 'modernity plainly did not include feminism - which is part of the reason why, reading it [Rayuela] now, it seems almost intolerably obsolete" (60). Neverthe less, we do not agree with Larsen that rereading Rayuela is obsolete. On the contrary, we believe that Rayuela is a great work of literature and that its greatness resides in the fact that it invites rereading, deconstruction and repeti tion through which its obsolete gender politics can be themselves reread as something else, which is not quite so "intolerable " especially to those that are excluded from it. We shall attempt just such a rereading or misreading. 5 In the novel, even linguistically speaking as a series of signs, such a "lector hembra" is penetrated, one can even say, raped by the author. Cort?zar chose to refer to the female reader as "el lector" rather than "la lectora." The feminine "la lectora," to characterize the female reader, is usurped by "el lector" which, by the way, by its conventional position in Spanish preceding "la hembra" seems indeed to be at the head and on top! One can even write here an entire book on the form "el lector hembra" and the ideological problems it poses. Although no critic to our knowledge has examined this form under the light of Cort?zar's closeted homosexuality, one can also choose to see "el lector macho," "el lector hembra," or "el lector alondra" (again here the masculine element wins over the feminine) as describing a linguistic (or reading) game played among male partners rather than within heterosexual linguistic codes</page><page sequence="20">416 and cultural norms. (For a discussion of Cort?zar's possible homosexuality, see Stavans's "The Latin Phallus" in which the author argues that Cort?zar's gay lifestyle as well as the fact that he "had probably contracted AIDS" and died from it have always remained a closeted secret within Latin American literature [234-35]. For a psychoanalytic interpretation of the role of the closet and of the enclosed space in terms of the maternal body in Cort?zar's work see Prieto 76-88.) We shall not deal with the linguistic aspects of the "el lector hembra" explicitly in this paper. However, it seems to us that the combination of mascu line-feminine in this form is linguistically indicative of what in the novel we believe exceeds the opposition male/female (and even homosexual/ heterosexual) and lies somewhere in between by playing with both linguistic or sexual signs: we shall soon name such excess "hermaphrodism" (not deter mined in biological terms). 6 Larsen writes: "What makes the aggressive masculinism of Rayuela really egregious ... is not that it tacitly legitimates such a gender(ed) heroics, but that it regards itself as being, for this very reason, at the vanguard of philosophical consciousness: To rape is to explain'; 'Otherness lasts only as long as woman lasts'" (59). 7 Although at first glance Hardin seems to construct a female readership in positive terms and to be sympathetic to such a "clumsy" reading (88; again, his words), it appears to us that, perhaps less openly than Cort?zar, he adopts the very misogynous position he claims to question. We shall deal with this prob lem very briefly here. For Hardin, it is the female reader that is Rayuela s winner, but Hardin still has such readers remain coded as clumsy, superficial, and stupid, a personifica tion of non-knowledge. Yet, the male reader even when he loses the novel's reading game still maintains his critical and penetrative spirit precisely as Cort?zar had prescribed him, or conceived him to be. Without questioning his own assumptions Hardin writes: "the male-readers, those who know, lose; the female-readers, those who do not know, win" (67). Males know (even how to lose by declaring magnanimously the female a winner), females do not know: "Since there are only two winners within the text, both of whom are female readers - La [sic] Maga reads, clumsy novels and Talita reads Quillet's Self Teaching Encyclopedia (a source of trivia, but not of knowledge [!] ) - we would be foolish not to examine the female reader as a winner" (Hardin 65). Why is it so important to win and why must reading be equal to winning? Why can one not simply read a novel? What exactly does "to win the reading game of Rayuela" mean? Why must there be an opposition between winners and losers in reading just as there is in Rayuela an opposition between good male readers and bad female readers? Why does "to lose'V'to win" have some kind of relationship with knowledge? What higher knowledge of what the author "means-to-say" does such winning reading accede to? Is it not that perhaps the closer to the author's "meaning-to-say" such reading is (the more such a reading reproduces Morelli's prescriptions), it has better chances at winning? One can take Hardin's adaptation of Cort?zar's phallocentric propositions a step further. For here we have a critic, a male critic for that matter, who also</page><page sequence="21">417 read Rayuela it seems critically, as an all-knowing (one can even say omniscient) "lector macho" reaching the conclusion that Rayuelds winner is the "not knowing-how-to-read" (the "clumsy") female reader. Hardin still remains the Critic (perhaps more critical than Cort?zar's critical "lector macho" and for this reason he is for us more at fault than Cort?zar's male reader) that at the end knows very well, or has the critical knowledge to perceive that Cort?zar's text is won by the female reader. Hardin does not denounce his male position, indeed he assumes it fully, even when he grants, in fact when he pretends that he is granting (and this is the problem) to the female reader a seemingly better position than the one assigned to it by Cort?zar. We have pointed out Hardin's own reading of Rayuela as an all-encompassing male reading only to imply what we shall attempt to argue shortly: one never wins any reading game (or, in fact, one never "wins" or "loses" when one reads) when one endows such acts of reading or writing with a sexual identity or sees them in terms of a biologi cally and essentially determined polarity, that is, in terms of male versus female. 8 Let us repeat, that this is a deconstructive interpretation of the novel and of the novel's readership in terms of a hyperbolic reading and writing that also take place between the graphic and the mechanical. Although this interpretation and its methodology as well as the "concept" of hypergraphy, which are clearly influenced by Derridean deconstruction and Deleuzian and hypertextual theory, have not been proposed before, they nonetheless would have been impossible without the assistance of previous readings of Rayuela of incalcu lable value. These, for example, include Yurkievich's "Prefiguraci?n," which sees the novel as a collage (107-21), Yovanovich's mosaic of characters (65-118), Garcia Canclini's bricolage (86), Puleo's palimpsest (63-77), and so forth. Computer technology and cybernetics are explicitly referred to by Cort?zar, as in the quasi-hypertextual insertion of a newspaper article about the neurobiologist Holger Hyden in a note by Morelli: "La memoria corresponde r?a, pues, a la ordenaci?n de las mol?culas de ?cidos nucleicos en el cerebro, que desempe?an el papel de las tarjetas perforadas en las computadoras modernas." (378) 9 Pope provides a discussion of this intertextual element of Rayuela. Comparing Rayuela with Gald?s's Lo prohibido, he sees Cort?zar's novel as a critique "con dureza [contra] una sociedad de consumo y fetichismo cultural" (128). How ever, it appears to us that such a critique is not due to what Gald?s's novel or Rayuela proclaim through their "characters" or their "plot." With respect to Rayuela it is rather its mechanism of self-mocking in which the novel resembles such a "sociedad de consumo y fetichismo cultural." In fact, Rayuela, is a narrative that sets consumption, or at least cultural consumption and recycling to work to the point of nausea. Almost every cultural product (music, theatre, painting, cinema, photography, newspaper articles, scientific essays, literary criticism and theory, poetry, etc.) without exception is accumulated and assimilated by it. Although Oliveira proffers in Chapter 34 his contempt for Gald?s's Lo prohibido, its very inclusion in Rayuela is part of this ironic critique through consumption and recycling or voracious amassment of cultural</page><page sequence="22">418 products. A less convincing interpretation of this intertextual element in Rayuela is offered by Castellano-Gir?n. 10 Although the influence of jazz in Cort?zar's Rayuela has been identified by critics, to our knowledge a structural trait such as syncope taken out of a musical genre such as jazz and applied to text has been overlooked. However, in her truly remarkable essay "Pursuing a Perfect Present," Doris Sommer thinks of the function of parentheses in Cort?zar's "El perseguidor" in both textual and musical terms: "Readers who notice this visual aid to Cort?zar's trespassing from music to manuscript may be surprised - as I was - to know that it may well be borrowed from a jazz critic writing about Parker ... Andr? Hodeir writes that Parker played 'in parentheses.' That is, he suggested as much music as he actually played; '... anyone who writes down a Parker chorus is obliged to include, in parenthesis ... notes that have hardly been played at all...' Whether or not Cort?zar ... took a cue for improvisation from jazz criticism, he certainly played stunning variations. Usually they are doubled solos (between Bruno's nonstop narrative and his preoccupied parentheses), but at least one inspired adaptation sets competitive voices in counterpoint" (Sommer 220-21). 11 Gonz?lez has compared Bataille and Cort?zar, not on the basis of Rayuela but the story "Recortes de prensa." He suggests that Cort?zar "seeks to go beyond Bataille's rather detached 'hypermorality' toward a more personal and critical view of literature's links with evil. Cort?zar wishes to show instead that there is no fixed, exterior place from which one can safely pass judgement: just as the distinctions between male and female, inside and outside, reader and writer, torturer and victim, are blurred in the story, so the possibility of rendering an objective moral judgement about events becomes more difficult, if not imposs ible ..." (Gonz?lez 246). Although in general terms we agree with Gonz?lez, we must differentiate our position (at least in the context of Rayuela, because of Bataille) from his very insightful article in that the very blurring of clear-cut distinctions through the structural marks of dotting, citing, syncopating in Rayuela implies a hyper ethics in the very special sense we are giving to this word. It insinuates an exceeding even of the idea of ethics (or at least of pseudo-ethics), and this exceeding of ethics is evil itself, an excess or a hyperbole itself. For us, the "worst" evil of Rayuela is not the evil it describes (through Wong's accounts of torture, for instance). The worst evil is the idea of Rayuela's "anthropophenic" over-coming of both good and evil or the suspension of their opposition through which one finds oneself to be no longer capable of passing moral judgement. This is the "worst" evil (and perhaps this is why Rayuela is intoler able in its structure to some critics) because it leaves us suspended without assurances, principles or grounds from which to hold on. The worst evil is the very transcendence or interruption of dialectics. It leaves us practically dis oriented, full of questions and doubts, but without answers. This over-coming is what "entails the greatest risk ... the menace of radical evil" (Derrida "Faith" 47), which is in fact the good's excluded other, just as the female reader is seemingly the male reader's excluded other in Rayuela. Hyperethics is Bataille's access to an "acephallic universe" beyond limits, dialectic or humanist determi</page><page sequence="23">419 nations. (Let us also not forget that as the etymologies of these two words also suggest, definitions and determinations are processes of delimiting, and demar cating: both the Latin finitio and the Greek terma are bounds, limits, ends, something with which hypergraphy will be at odds.) 12 In Greek, the prefix "miso-" of "misogynous" means hate, but we have here seized the opportunity to play with the "mis" of mis-conception and "mis conduct." 13 We are not attempting here to replace Rayuelds hermaphrodite reader with the transsexual. Rather, we consider Deleuze's and Guattari's transsexuality as a useful, non-binary and non-essentializing category beyond humanity that could explain by analogy an anthropophenic reader. The hermaphrodite is neither about one sex nor about two different and separated sexes. It contains both at once, but without the one collapsing into the other. Furthermore, by excising any biological attributes from it (such as the head or female and male reproduc tive organs alike), we deliberately refuse to recognize such a hermaphrodite reader in biological and anthropomorphic terms. 14 Although critics of Rayuela have not seen Oliveira as a figure of a schizoid reader, it is true that the theme of schizophrenia in Cort?zar's work has been detected by Alazraki in the character of Alina Reyes in "Lejana" (74-75) and Amestoy Aronne, who sees "schizoid disintegration" in Cort?zar's "pursuer," only to disavow it because in her view the searcher's "will [is] to overcome it" (153). What is so terrible and stigmatizing about schizophrenia that compels a critic to drive it out, or expel it from her interpretative space by concluding its "overcoming" by the searcher's will? The disavowal or exorcism of schizo phrenia (a mental "disease") from Cort?zar's work is as suspect as Rayuelds displacement of the female other. 15 Traditional criticism, for example, has identified such doubles in dialectical terms which we are here attempting to exceed through schizophrenia and hermaphrodism as hypersex. These doubles caught within opposition are usually mediators that assist Oliveira in his narcissistic self-complacency to find his centre (or become more self-centred) or to help him find what he calls his kibbutz (see in particular the episode with la clocharde in Chapter 36). In this criticism Oliveira is himself a double of Morelli, within the author/reader opposition, who, just like Morelli, "serves Cort?zar as a mouthpiece of his literary philosophy" (Larsen 62). Alazraki, for instance, sees the double (and the bridge) as an intermediary for a self's "authentic" (his word), r?int?gration in its search of identity: "'pursuers' ... throughout Cort?zar's work seek and explore a country which is but the territory of the self in search of authenticity" (Alazraki 80). One wonders about the concept of the "authentic" here. Authen tic to whom and from whose point of view? (Usually, it is from the point of view of the human being as indicated by the concept of "self" almost always identified with a "him" or a "her".) Is it not that the concept of "authenticity" presupposes some kind of fixed ("authentic," that is, ontologically true) essence that one has lost on the way and to which one has to return (urgently, indeed)? And what happens to the other, the intermediary the double, the non-essence or absence that assists one to do so? Why there always must be one (a unique and</page><page sequence="24">420 exclusive being) "who" must reclaim "his" authenticity (or identity) at the expense of others; at the expense of others "who" usually are more than eager to dispense at a drop of a hat with their "authenticity" for "someone" superior than them? For us, such an interminable parade of doubles moves beyond dialectics and even interrupts and syncopates dialectics. In this parade one never encounters a self, but the self's refractions into its others. This indicates precisely that Oliveira's self-construction (and by extension the reader's, the author's, the novel's, the text's, and so on) is always bound to fail in the split ting reflection of alterity's mirror. 16 The parts exist in what Deleuze and Guattari call "disjunctive synthesis" or the body without organs, which "is opposed not to the organs but to that organization of the organs called the organism" (A Thousand Plateaus 158). 17 The rejection of Cort?zar's theory of reading also includes the category of the female reader, a point which Larsen would have disagreed with. For Larsen a "postmodern reading" (what really is "postmodern reading" here?) of Rayuela implies that "it is now the 'lector hembra' - not the novel - that seems entitled to demand 'accomplices'" (Larsen 64). It appears to us that Larsen repeats Hardin's questionable position of merely reversing the binary. Nonetheless, as we are reading Rayuelds hyperreader or "useless" reader, such a "lector" is one that is no longer able to reproduce the author's reading theory in its entirety, that is, even when this theory has something to prescribe or say about a female reader. One can take this a step further. Such a useless reader cannot reproduce himself by not reproducing the author's theories. Consequently, he is no longer a reader, for he is one that does not read, or to use a clich?, he is as dead as the author, his so-called "camarada de camino." 18 This implies that one no longer even knows what/who a "reader" is or if it is (the essence: "reader"). In fact, we wish to stress such implications precisely because in most of Payuelas interpretations (both those for or against its reading theory), one always begins with the preconception that one already knows what the concept "reader" is. By having established a priori some essence, category or fixed identity (i.e. that of the "reader") one proceeds to read Rayuela as if such concepts were already an unquestionable given; as if the "reader" were an indestructible essence (or reality). In this sense, the interpreta tion does not question what it assumes or presupposes as a fact and which guides its reading of Rayuela. Therefore, it is bound to be trapped from the start into the Morellian prescriptions that indeed not only claim to know "who" the reader is, but also claim to be able to recognize such a reader by its gender. 19 To a certain extent, this second (in fact, excessive) understanding of hyper graphy, which is more "misconceiving" than Morelli's misconceptions, insinu ates a question mark placed over the first level of hypergraphy and of other readings of Rayuela that take for granted the fact that Rayuela itself had reserved multidimensionality for a male writer (Morelli) and for his smart "lector c?mplice o macho" (Oliveira). 20 This "dimension" is excess itself, even the excess from the very metaphysical concept of "dimension." Therefore, it can no longer be a dimension in the usual sense of the word but it must be understood more radically.</page><page sequence="25">421 WORKS CITED ALAZRAKi, jaime.
