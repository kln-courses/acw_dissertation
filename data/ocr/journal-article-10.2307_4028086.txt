John Brooke and Geoffrey Cantor show how often science is rooted in theological considerations, and how frequently religion mirrors the science of its age. In the seventeenth century, Robert Boyle insisted that natural phenomena should be explained solely in terms of matter in motion. This may seem to sever the relations between God and nature, but he further argued that the more mechanical the world, the better for religion since it made it clear that the world had been designed. Machines do not spring into existence by themselves! In the nineteenth century Lord Kelvin grounded the principle of the conservation of energy in the belief that God alone can create and destroy energy, while his contemporary, Frederick Temple, the Archbishop of Canterbury, saw the extension of natural law into the biological world as a confirmation of the existence of laws governing moral behaviour. The notion that science and religion are competing rather than complementary world-views would have aston- ished Newton or Kepler, and it is only in the nineteenth century that it became commonplace. It received its canonical form in Andrew Dickson White's History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom, a reaction to the clerical battering that he had been administered for proposing a liberal charter for Cornell University. White battered in turn, but his conflict with the religious establishment should be dedramatized; instead of seeing it as a typical confrontation between 'science' and 'religion', it may more usefully be seen as reflecting the waning of the power of the clergy as cultural leaders and the rise of a scientific meritocracy. New professional standards were urged, although they were sometimes honoured more in the breach than in the practice. For instance, the chemist Marcellin Berthelot, one of the leading French scientists, justified his re- jection of the concept of the atom as follows: 'I do not want chemistry to degenerate into a religion: I do not want chemists to believe in the</page><page sequence="2">238 Book reviews existence of atoms as Christians believe in the existence of Christ in the communion wafer'. It is clear that such an incident, and several others recounted in this book, cannot be captured by a master-narrative that relies on immutable definitions of science and religion. In order to know how science and religion actually impinged on one another, we have to see them in the context in which they were con- structed, modified or reconstructed. The history of science is not simply the history of progress in the acquisition of truth. It is also the story of the extent to which scientific practice depends on social and economic factors, intellectual tastes and, last but not least, religious sensibilities. The popular interpretation of Galileo's troubles with the Roman Curia is perhaps the best illustration of the pitfall of assuming that there is something essential to science and something essential to religion that keeps them perpetually at odds. Chapter 4 of this book, 'The con- temporary relevance of the Galileo affair', is an excellent attempt at breaking this mould. Brooke and Cantor explain in lucid and non-polemical historical prose the genuine scientific difficulties that were raised concerning the Copernican system, and show that some high-ranking officials, such as Cardinal Robert Bellarmine, were open-minded and anxious to avoid un- necessary clashes with the new science. Galileo was right, of course: the Earth does go around the Sun. This much we can see from satellites in the twentieth century, but in the seventeenth century Galileo had only a telescope. With that instrument he was able to see and show to others that there were more stars than had ever been imagined, that Venus had phases and Jupiter satellites, and that the Moon appeared to have craters. What he could neither witness nor demonstrate was that the Earth was moving in space. No amount of looking could solve that question. This is why the vast majority of Catholic astronomers rallied to the system that the Protestant Tycho Brahe had devised, and taught that the planets circle the Sun, while the Sun itself goes around the Earth. In 1616 Bellarmine cautioned Galileo, I say that if there were a true demonstration that the sun is at the centre of the world and the earth in the third heaven, and that the sun does not circle the earth but the earth circles the sun, then one would have to proceed with great care in explaining the Scriptures that appear contrary, and say rather that we do not understand them than that what is demonstrated is false. Galileo, however, thought he had a decisive proof, one that we can see with our own eyes: the tides. They occur, according to Galileo, because the Earth both rotates on its axis and revolves around the Sun. If Church officials cannot be approved for condemning a scientific theory, they can hardly be blamed for listening to the scientists who told them that this argument was bogus. If Galileo is the first name that springs to mind when the relations between science and religion are mentioned, the next is Darwin. It is some- times said that with Darwinism came the death of God. But whose God? The diversity of responses to the theory of evolution can only be understood if we consider the different images of the deity that were entertained in the nineteenth century. Two such images clearly took a beating from The Origin of Species. The first was that of the magician who conjured up new species out of primeval slime. The demise of this image was hailed by the Christian socialist Charles Kingsley: God was wise enough to make things make themselves. The second image was more sophisticated. It was the notion of God as artisan or mechanic, and had been given its classic formulation by Paley, who marvelled at the design and craftsmanship that could be observed in the human eye or ear. Darwin made the watchmaker-God redundant by providing an account of how such structures had come about by gradual refinement over immense periods of time. Although this appeared disastrous to some theologians, many felt that it was a much-needed corrective to an anthropomorphic conception of God that eschewed the darker side of creation and was insensitive to the poor and suffering. Long before Darwin appeared on the scene, Paley's construction of nature had been criticized for preferring a remote locksmith to the demanding God of Christianity. The theory of evolution did not toll the knell of a departing God but was an invitation to</page><page sequence="3">Book reviews 239 reconsider his image. The image of God the artisan gradually faded from European con- sciousness to be replaced by that of God the artist. This image left room for an evolving landscape with the artist entering into an intimate relationship with what was being made. The Jesuit modernist George Tyrrell, writing in the early years of the twentieth century, bor- rowed Darwin's metaphor of a branching tree: The universe is like a great tree, that pushes out its branches, however and wherever it can, seeking to realize its whole nature... in every one of them, but aiming at no collective effort. This is its play, this is its life, this is, if you will, its end. Brooke and Cantor explore this kind of natural theology, but they also offer a case study of the Quakers, a distinctive social group that had several members elected to the Royal Society, including John Dalton in the nineteenth century and Arthur Stanley Eddington in our own. The last chapter examines a number of questions that affected traditional conceptions of divine providence in the debate over the chemical reconstruction of vital processes. The contro- versy may be seen as heralding current dis- cussions over biotechnological methods of im- proving nature by freezing embryos (to allow women to have their children when they want, even past the menopause) or isolating the gene for the ageing process (in the hope of developing a pill that would add fifty years to life ex- pectancy). Will science reconstruct nature? And if it does will theology be its handmaiden? Brooke and Cantor have written an out- standing book on a difficult subject. They provide lively and stimulating accounts of incidents that loomed large in the development of our modern idea of nature without slipping into facile generalizations about the respective roles of science and religion. Scientific inquiry and religious quest have travelled together, not always in the most companionable of moods, yet strangely aware that together they can help us keep faith with the future. Reconstructing Nature can be warmly recommended to anyone interested in knowing by what curious highways and byways science and religion have brought us where we are today. It would make an excellent textbook and should be reissued in paperback edition. WILLIAM SHEA University of Strasbourg</page></plain_text>
