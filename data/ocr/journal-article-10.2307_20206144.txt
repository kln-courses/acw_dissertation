A revi sionist overview of the issue of professional interfaces in the popular arts is followed by a discussion of the influence of space technology and natural space phenomena on human personal and collective belief systems in order to open the way for an outline of the con cept of participatory cultures and the relationship between fiction and science. Michael Punt: Introduction This paper was stimulated by the film Galaxy Quest (Parisot, 1999), which collapses the fictitious dimensions of space travel into the scientific perception of real space travel in order to reveal some insights into the cultural construction of space. In this collaboration, the three authors [1] inquire into the metaphorical, metaphysical and metadiscursive aspects of tech nology by integrating a range of scholarly activities and am plifying them through non-hierarchical collaboration within an institutional environment [2]. It combines the research of artists, filmmakers, photographers and designers with the aim of advancing our understanding of the history of technology and exploring new modalities of academic and practical re search. Consistent with this overarching concern, this paper deals with the human imagination and regards it as a mir ror image of space. Like space, the imagination is largely un knowable, and all that we can ever say about it as an entity is based on conjecture drawn from our fragmentary perception of the wake of its apparently infinite energy. We have chosen, as a methodology, to study the visible residue of the human imagination in the arts, science and technology and to ex trapolate the network forces that seem to intersect at their instantiation, aware all the time that we are describing a hu man and cultural condition rather than explaining it. For this group of authors our common point of departure is cinema, a technological anachronism that initially caught the public imagination in ways that no scientist, inventor, technologist, entrepreneur or showman ever predicted. The 19th-century conjuror and cinema pioneer Georges M?li?s and a few British eccentrics?mediums, showmen and instrument makers?are possible exceptions. M?li?s is perhaps best known in space research for making the first space movie (indebted no doubt to Jules Verne), and his career as a shoemaker, conjuror, theater owner and early film producer provides ev idence of the technological imagi nation as it reveals the residues of the very antagonistic energies that stimulated the enthusiasm for cinema. M?li?s was not unique in his fascination with the ecology of technology at the close of the 19th century. Perhaps less familiar is the British film maker James Williamson, who made The Big Swallow in 1900, a time when, for metropolitan audiences at least, moving pic tures were becoming familiar, and the sight of a cinematogra pher filming a busy street?or sometimes even the venue of a forthcoming s?ance?was also becoming a commonplace. As the sales catalog note that accompanied the film at the time tells us, we see an ordinary man become so irate at a ubiqui tous photographer that he swallows him up, camera tripod and all. After his mischief he backs off from the film camera, smack ing his lips, and hams up the joke for the audience in a ges ture of mutual conspiracy. It is a simple gag film manifesting an antique humor, but it would be a mistake to see it simply as a schoolboyjoke, since, although there is a displacement from the cin?matographe to the still camera, the film is nonethe less suggestive of a certain unease?even antagonism?aris ing from the gap between a photographic technology that is used to represent the world and those who look at its repre sentations. This particular disaffection is elegantly summed up in the conspiratorial gesture Williamson's actor makes as he digests the machine that represents him; he takes technology into the imagination of the interior body from which it was born as an invention. Re-assimilating the machine is a senti ment that, judging by our own cinema, has persisted, as we see a recirculation of both a celebration and a covert criticism of new technology in popular movies such as Jurassic Park (Spiel berg, 1993), Barb Wire (Hogan, 1996), Twister (de Bont, 1996), Mission Impossible (de Palma, 1996) and, as Martha Blassnigg discusses below, Barbarella (Vadim, 1968). As we sit in the cin ema in the thrall of the technology, we celebrate its downfall as time after time the old values of embodied intelligence and intuition succeed where technology fails.

David Hurn) namics in a coherent reality provides our first piece of evidence that the imagina tion is dark matter manifest to our intel ligence in its various instantiations as complex, intersecting network forces be yond the reach of reason [3]. Martha Blassnigg: Desire, Imagination and Technology: How to Love (in) Space This scientific idea of dark matter, whether meant in reference to the still unexplored mystery of the universe or used as a metaphor for our inexplicable human brain capacities, provides a per feet platform for imagination and fan tasy within popular culture and offers a plane for metaphysical and imaginative inquiry. In a spiritual context, this con cept of darkness and void apparently contradicts the prevalent imagination of divine light and the spiritual imaginary crowded with heavenly creatures, yet there are notions that relate invisible di vine light to darkness [4]. In the most profound realm of darkness, the space craft and the angel both have conquered and colonized outer space as part of our human attempts to overcome the mate rial limits of three dimensions by fusing the spiritual with technological media. Their histories have become fused, so that as technology has turned wireless, an gels have become wingless once again [5]. My own field research reveals that they can present themselves in contemporary clairvoyant perception as rather abstract light-beings similar to the Aurora Bore alis. In this interrelation of spirit and technology, the angel can be seen as a symptomatic concept that exceeds its re ligious connotations and, as we will see, can be turned into an intercultural, in terconnecting, service-oriented, mobile, flexible, genderless and ubiquitous me diator. Traveling through and beyond the material limits of time and space, the an gel becomes an almost perfect compan ion to the bytes and bits of contemporary communications technology. In comparison to the dominant ex pressions of fear and destruction con fronting alien space in most mainstream movies, more constructive imagination has been projected and reiterated in pop ular subcultures since the technologi cal venture of space travel in the 1950s. As we have seen, almost from its ear liest beginnings, cinema incorporated popular and esoteric interpretations of metaphysics into its "imagination." As a consequence, cinema can provide an ev idential base in both its medium and con tent for the exploration of the way space and time have been imagined and also how they have been understood scientif ically. Edgar Morin, for example, reflect ing upon the similarities between the cinematographic experience and human imagination [6], notes how cinema of fers a symbiosis that integrates the spec tator in the flux of the film, and the film into the psychical flux of the spectator [7]. Cinema, the dream machine or time machine, and "homo d?mens," the pro ducer of fantasies, myths, ideologies and dreams, both evoke magic as an interi orized quality through affection. Robert D. Romanyshyn argues that when Alberti (1404-1472) invented the linear per spective of depth with a vanishing point, the inexplicable moved inside and be came an interior quality of imagination. This new perception not only moved an gels and demons out of heaven and clouds onto the same horizontal plane in paint ings, but also prepared the imagination for space travel by liberating the figure from the base line of the image and situ ating it in the middle of the frame [8]. Cultural expressions in various me dia productions are indispensable both to illustrate and to justify scientific tech nological ventures [9]. In this sense, many have argued for the important role played by the transmission of film images 14 Pun? et al., From M?li?s to (?ataxy (?liest</page><page sequence="4">of the 1969 moon landing in touching, involving and convincing a broad audi ence of the actuality of the event [10]. Unlimited outer space offers an open platform to express our imaginations and reflects like a 360?, three- (or maybe more?) dimensional screen or plane, inviting us to experience not merely an audiovisual performance, but also a multi-sensorial event and engagement that includes the body [11] and our con sciousness as equal faculties. In what fol lows I discuss the idea of space travel as an instantiation where imagination, de sire and technology meet and interact [12] in one particular appearance that seems to have resisted historical change in its various recent reiterations: the story of Barbarella. Barbarella, the 1968 science fiction movie directed by Roger Vadim [13] (Ar ticle Frontispiece, Figs 1-3), is based on a 1962 French comic strip by Jean Claude Forest. The film launches desires and imagination related to the liberational political agenda of the 1960s into a space comedy: sexy, playful, humorous, ironic, erotic, fantastic, political... However, alongside the film's outspokenness and directness in matters concerning sexual desire and Utopian technology, there is also a rather concealed desire for a quest for innocence and restoration of an ideal world, bound into ecological, demo cratic, left-wing concerns and dreams of 1960s social and political movements. In Vienna in March 2004, the story of Barbarella celebrated its world premiere as a theatrical production [14], adver tised as a sexy rock musical. In the musi cal, Barbarella, the sexy space agent traveling in outer space, has to save her crew on planet Sogo and, with the help of the angel Pygar, she gains victory over the Black Queen, who tries to seduce her. In the reception room of the Raimund Theatre in Vienna, where the musical was staged, the Italian coffee brand Lavazza exhibited its "2004 Mission to Espresso" calendar with photographs by Thierry Le Gu?s. The promotional calendar refers directly to Barbarella [15]. Lavazza's pub lic photo contest "Espresso, Space and Time" has produced a series of portfolios centered on coffee, space, desire and imagination and reflects the public's affinity for the subject of (outer) space. Concurrent with the Barbarella mu sical, the Architektur Zentrum Wien in Vienna's MuseumsQuartier presented "The Austrian Phenomenon," an exhibi tion of 1960s neo-avant garde architec ture that surpassed the limits of physical construction and became a medium for concepts on the exploration of space (Color Plate B). In a transfer between technology, art, pop sensibility and ar chitecture, the experimental projects on exhibit displayed a technological opti mism in their futuristic visions. Event and play temporarily modulated the meaning of the body in urban spaces and pre sented constructed extensions of con sciousness: "a space travel, like astronauts, but into inner space" [16]. These three contemporary examples of the common practice of cultural reit eration and simulation above (musical, coffee promotion and installation) show the complexity of interrelated references and a certain exoticism in the treatment of the subject of space travel. Displacing the idea of space research from the lab oratory into a comedie framework creates the opportunity for unlimited imagina tion to expand and explore the desirable otherness of the unknown. In the exam ple of Barbarella's reiterations, the dis placement occurs by the projection of human desires onto a particular scientific research project, so that the gap between popular culture and the scientific com munity is seemingly decreased. As the popularity of the cult movie Barbarella shows, audiences are still responding to this mechanism and carrying it forward into future imagination [17]. The Angel and Technology in Barbarella: A Brief Case Study The interior of Barbarella's cozy space craft, where she performs her famous striptease [18] at the beginning of the movie, presents an analogy with the an gel Pygar, whose feathered wings and cozy nest serve Barbarella's pleasures. Both the spacecraft and Pygar are used in the film as agents to extend human travel through space and as amplifiers of human physical and mental capacities: When Barbarella's spacecraft malfunc tions, Pygar takes over and transports her to her destiny, the palace of Sogo. Even though the angel Pygar is shown with an anthropomorphic shape, attributed with an attractive, winged, masculine body, it is treated like an object by the inhabitants of the city of darkness. Consequently, Pygar's appearance and blindness are reminiscent of a machine, a hybrid form between cyborg and human in space, slightly like the character Data in the Star Trek: The Next Generation series. In this view, Pygar is an angelic machine that extends Barbarella's capacities, being operated by her: Barbarella heals Pygar of its inability to fly by making love to it, which could be read as a reparation or restoration of its functioning, and its lES wings are treated like a mechanical ex- H9 tension of its body [19]. The angel's su- flN} perhuman capacities not only are at the Hpa service of Barbarella, but also seem to be under her control. HHI At first sight, the character Pygar rep resents seeming opposition to technol ogy in its traditional sense by virtue of the angel's human-like appearance and its incorporation of virtues such as love and empathy. But at the same time Pygar forms an analogy to the many erotically shaped and attractive machines in the d? cor on Sogo, forming an organic part, connecting technology with body shapes and connoting physical desire. A com parison between the movie and the mu sical Barbarella reveals this relationship in the story's crucial love scene: In the movie, Barbarella makes love to the an gel Pygar, who then regains its will to fly. Here Pygar wears only feathered pants, whereas in the musical the angel is cov ered with an armor-like outfit, hiding its muscles. Apart from the angel's more ma chine-like appearance, the musical rather relates to the original comic strip in this respect. Barbarella does not make love to Pygar but instead to the robot Victor: a metallic cyborg, a "love-machine." The 1960s film of Barbarella clearly ex presses how, in popular culture, technol ogy itself can serve as a medium for the production of sensory experience. Du ran Duran's pleasure machine offers both pleasure and the potential to physically destroy Barbarella; in contrast to the ma terial, eternal and Divine love is evoked by the angel Pygar, who finally embraces both the hero Barbarella and the wicked Dark Queen. Pygar wears wings, Bar barella is armored; together they incor porate forces that act on the desires projected on the imaginary of technol ogy and spirituality. It seems as if they both need each other: humans and an gels and humans and technology, hand in hand, even in love, in physical union to explore dark matter, confront alteri ties and re-establish order in the universe [20]. When Barbarella curls into Pygar's protecting arms at the film's end, ac cepting the union in this love together with the Black Queen, she seems to be transformed into a child, a being beyond sex, regaining her own innocence. Sex served as a medium to relate to the un known and alien environment and en counters, and now the universe and Barbarella's body are reconciled and she returns to Earth, where physical sex has long been transformed into a telepathic orgiastic ritual. Punt et al, From M?li?s to Galaxy Quest 15</page><page sequence="5">The contemporary reiteration of these attributes in cinema, and indeed the con tinuing reincarnation of Barbarellas im age-culture in the last 40 years, not only express the unchanged, profound human desire to explore the unknown, but also evoke metaphors of the metaphysical in scientific space and the desire to ex plore experiences in a multi-sensory, sensual environment instead of a purely virtual or scientific one. In this context, the angel serves as a metaphysical model that operates as a screen for projections of human desire and for the imagina tion of superhuman capacities. In Bar barella, as discussed above, spirituality and technology are interrelated and in terconnected. In a metaphysical view of technology, genderless angels relate closely to genderless technology. Bar barella and her persistent imagery, how ever, have gendered space: We have: (1) a sexy Barbie doll seduced by men in the 1960s, which has in our own time become a feminist agent (in the musical, Bar barella enters erotic relationships only with women, the angel Pygar and the ro bot Victor); (2) a space traveler with the mission to explore the "Espresso planet"; and (3) even an empowered blonde in control as played by pop star Kylie Mi nogue in one of her music videos (as David Surman argues below). Through the introduction of sex in relation to the angel and technology, we see physical pleasure and the subject of the body ap plied to metaphysical and technological ventures. Friedmar Apel argues that the Romantic period at the turn of the 19th century demonstrated an embodiment of the senses and restoration of mythol ogy in the appearance of angels in the arts, as a contra movement against the mechanization and rationalization of the world. A desire for love, eroticism and sexuality infiltrates the longing to reach the invisible, divine or transcendental. Reviewing recent spiritualist movements and the broad popularity of the subject of angels, I join Apel in questioning if the beginning of the third millennium brings back a similar tendency, a desire to re store sacred spaces, esoteric knowledge and, as he calls it, a Himmelssehnsucht (a "longing for heavenly realms" [21 ] ). The myth of Barbarella suggests a con structive look into the infinite, unknown and mysterious universe by applying love and awe, instead of fear, against deter ministic, destructive visions of alienated extraterrestrial space. The symptomatic reiteration and persistence of a cultural phenomenon, as in the case of Barbarella, calls for strategies of synthesis in or der to reconfigure our understanding of popular imagination and help find new portals and bridges between academic discourse and the aspirations of contem porary popular culture. David Surman: Plausibility and the Technological Imaginary I would like to conclude this collabora tive presentation by proposing a number of core principles in the theorization of space, popular culture and audience. The examples I take to illustrate my view ex press a particular involvement in the pop ular. Little effort was needed on my part to draw together the various instances shown here to illustrate the popular (al beit fictional) representation of space. Imaginary "outer" space is everywhere. As we have seen, in a large variety of cultural instances the expression of space exploration as a thematic, iconic or sym bolic referent diverts drastically from the pioneer image of space exploration first popularized by Russian and American ef forts. In the continuities and disconti nuities of visual culture, it is reasonable to suggest that, while there has been lit tle modification of the image of space of fered by popular science, the aesthetic modalities of science fiction have?in a sustained dialogue with its various au diences?developed a modus operandi quite distinct from its rationalist coun terpart. Of course, science-fictional represen tations of space precede any actual human intervention into that domain. In imagining ourselves there, our ex ploratory desires manifest in technolo gies capable of achieving our original speculation. Imagination, technology and desire constitute an interdependent cy cle that affects and sustains our techno logical development. It seems, however, when looking at the popular representa tion of imagined technology, that such a paradigm is more complex. Desire, a con stituent part of our elusive consciousness, is never focused in its entirety upon any singular instance. Spiritual, technologi cal and libidinal desires intermingle in the imaginary, and while rationalist sci ence effaces the trace of such cross-polli nations, the popular imaginary of science enjoys the product of this meta-combi nation of influences. The plurality of desires manifest in sci ence fiction ensures its continuity and accommodates a far larger range of in terpretations than the rhetorical strat egies of "popular" science, which still expresses a modernist conception of its audience. In science fiction, the specta tor is always prepared to meet the creator halfway, permitting lapses of rational co herence for the greater good of an affec tive experience that is continuous with both contemporary and comparable ear lier works. Consider the layered desires that com bine in the cover image of the May 1951 issue of Marvel Science, a popular pulp magazine of 1940s and 1950s America: The sexuality of the Hollywood icon is ill? ^li^^H ill ^I^B- ^^ 16 Punt et ai, From M?li?s to Galaxy Quest</page><page sequence="6">idealized in the image of a woman who is being carried into a space ship by two suited astronauts, dually representative of both science fact and fiction. All the while, the woman seems not to need a space suit in outer space. A similar ex ample of this surreal image of difference can also be seen on the cover of the June 1941 issue of Thrilling Wonder Stories, in which women again do not seem to re quire special clothing for outer space. Representations of space in the cinema are characteristically divided between those that sustain the scientific rhetoric of technological development {Apollo 13 [Howard, 1995], The Right Stuff [Kauf man, 1983] ) and those that utilize the environment of outer space to play out distinctly "earthly" preoccupations. Steven Soderbergh's recent remake of Solaris (2003) uses the master signifier of the space station to illustrate the tragic fragility of earthly memory. Drawing a parallel between lost memory and the frustration of an unknowable region of space, Soderbergh's feature film uses the image of space as a potential fu ture into which domestic frustrations are sustained. How are these images culturally legiti mated, when their irrationality seems so explicit as to debunk the value of their narrative content? And secondly, why are such desire-driven images so persistent in our visual culture? The film scholar Christian Metz developed a critical defi nition of "plausibility" with which we may account for those images that persist in culture, compared with those that do not. He writes, The Plausible... is an arbitrary and cul tural restriction of real possibles; it is in fact censorship; among all the possibles of figurative fiction, only those autho rised by the previous discourse will be chosen [22]. There is much to extract from this. The representation of space, in the early cin ema of M?li?s at the turn of the 20th cen tury and, even earlier, the humorous cartoons of 19th-century caricaturist Rodolphe T?pffer, preceded the actual ity of space exploration. The moon landing and its subsequent realm of representation is scientifically plausible. And yet, should we set the cul tural presence of this particular mode of representing space against that which we may broadly term "science fiction," there is an unarguable predominance of fan tastical imagery in our everyday domes tic culture. The lure of the rational is nothing compared with the refined ar ticulations of the imagined. The irrationality of images such as those of the above-mentioned pulp mag azine covers is not simply the expression of uneducated comic artists. It represents the most persistent means of creating space as a plausible phenomenon, to the extent that it is even rendered domestic, as in Solaris. On the magazine covers, the men, protected in their space suits, are accompanied by a woman who appar ently has no need for such technological baggage. She is in her element. This prin ciple of sexual difference is maintained in the representation of extraterrestrials in a host of varied instances, most notably in recent blockbuster franchises such as Alien, with the female alien seducing/de stroying the human as astronaut-ex plorer-imperialist. In any sign system, meaning?it is argued?is the product of a regulated system of differences, and in developed systems certain signifiers be come invested with paradigmatic differ ential significance. From a feminist position it is argued that the sexualized woman becomes the sign for anything that is other, including aliens, and conse quently retains its signifying power de spite changes in cultural styles. Jane Fonda's striptease at the beginning of the movie Barbarellawas recently imitated by the pop star Kylie Minogue in the video for "put your self in my place." In the video, Kylie similarly strips off a pink astronaut's suit from the relative confines of her space station. Empow ered by her technology, she blocks the gaze of the gray-suited male astronauts outside of her spaceship with a plume of smoke. The video is rendered "plausible" by its continuity with Barbarella and the broader trends of science fiction. Differ ence articulates the desirability of the protagonist and provides a means to per mit identification between audience and moving-image text. I would like to suggest that "differ ence," that everyday determinant against which we develop our identity, is needed in the representation of space in popu lar science. The role of gender, sexual ity, race, class, physical ability, even hair color, is necessary to the future plausi bility of represented space. Identification is a fiercely contested principle in the humanities, and there are vast tracts devoted to often-opposing theories of how identification functions. Be it cognitive, psychoanalytic, phenom enological or narratological, all theories of identification, and specifically those in film studies, locate difference as the core principle through which audience par ticipants relate to the world of repre sentation. All representation functions through the articulation of types, and yet flEs the representation of the human in the W?3 space of popular science has been woe- ^^H fully devoid of difference, choosing in- ??| stead to recall tenuous continuities to the (now distant) moon landing. For popular science to plausibly rep resent our ongoing role in space, it must necessarily engage with a more sophisti cated representational approach to space, one that locates difference at the core of the scientific imaginary. Modernist ac counts of the audience no longer account for the heterogeneity and complexity of mass culture. The realization that the vast majority of space is unknowable echoes the topography of the popular imaginary, whose complexity has evaded scholarship since the 1960s. It is, however, possible to observe the continuities and discontinu ities, what is permitted to rehearse its codes of representation and what is dis avowed. In Metz's terms, the most plau sible of images, primarily those that recall our foundational experiences of differ ence, will presumably be those toward which popular science may move if it is to articulate its message in the vocabulary of the popular imaginary.

Among others, the Syrian monk Dionysius the Are opagite (6th century), a pagan philosopher, and the German abbess Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179) have perceived visions filled with endless choirs and hierarchies of angels, beings of light. An old Jewish notion in the Bible mentions that God dwelt in in effable darkness, a "truly mystical darkness of un knowing" (Exodus 20:21). And Dionysius the Areopagite wrote in a letter: "The divine darkness is that 'unapproachable light' where God is said to live," in John Gage, Colour and Culture: Practice and Mean ing from Antiquity to Abstraction (London: Thames and Hudson, 1993) p. 60. 5. Since the first half of the fifth century, winged angels have been populating space throughout art history. Fritz Saxl suggests that the wings of Chris tianity's angels go back to such Greek mythological figures as Mercury and Iris, but mainly Victory, who also played a crucial role in Roman art. This pagan image has infiltrated Christian mythology to an ex tent that it even contradicts the original writings of the Bible, in which angels had to announce them selves for who they were, as they otherwise were not recognizable, being human in their appearance.

Several media theorists, including Marshall McLuhan, have argued that the moon landing as me dia spectacle dominates the question of whether the event actually took place. This notion links up with postmodernist theories, such as Jean Baudrillard's concept of the hyperreal and the fact that while peo ple's imaginations demand the real thing, they must create fakes in order to get it.

In recent years, the senses have been re-intro duced most prominently into science; and since fem inist perspectives have entered scientific discourse and artists' work relates more closely to scientific re search, the faculty of the body cannot be denied any longer. Technology and spirituality have both shown a tendency to neglect the body in the past; contem porary discourses ask for a reconsideration and restoration of the union and interrelation between body and mind. 12. Michael Punt and Robert Pepperell have ex pressed this triangular relationship in their model of technology-desire-imagination, three faculties that are interrelated and contingent: "The imagination is prompted by human desire to modify the world through technology, which in turn prompts desire," in Michael Punt and Robert Pepperell, The Postdigi tal Membrane: Imagination, Technology and Desire (Bris tol, U.K.: Intellect Books, 2000) p. 25. 13.

Jean Hugues de Chatillon (set design) says of the Lavazza girl (the model Ingrid Parewijck): "She's got charisma, a strong character, such blonde hair... her presence is classic but extremely elegant and a bit adventurous. I see her as the Barbarella of the future Lavazza world, who is astonished as she goes out to discover the world." He also expresses the mysteriousness of black coffee as an analogy to black space: "For the choice of the scenes I tried to approach the essence of coffee, which is a dark and soluble substance burnt by the sun and by fire."

To give another example that relates science fic tion literature and film, Constance Penley has shown, in the context of slash subculture, how amateur (mostly female) writers have subverted and rewrit ten Star Trek to incorporate their own sexual and so cial desires. Constance Penley, NASA/TREK: Popular Science and Sex in America (London: Verso, 1997). 18. Domestic issues about living in space have been addressed by the European Space Agency in its fea ture "Daily Life" at &lt;http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ ESAHlV0VMOC_astronauts_0.html&gt; (accessed 31 July 2005), which comments on the complications of daily operations, such as getting dressed, in a zero gravity environment. 19. Inhabitants of the planet pluck Pygar's wing feath ers as if they were merely a costume, and Barbarella reanimates Pygar by moving its wings, rather than following the Dark Queen's advice to do a "mouth to mouth." This does not seem to bother Pygar, whereas in other fictionalized accounts in literature, wings are often presented as an integral part of an angel's body, being extremely sensitive to the touch {Samara Trilogy, by Sharon Shinn, 1997-1999) ; or sometimes a highly erogenous area {The Vinter's Luck, by Eliza beth Knox, 2000). Furthermore, Barbarella takes Py gar by its hand (as the player does in the video game Icon) and pulls it behind her, treating it like a toy? a sexual toy, whose maleness itself is linked to tech nology, as when Barbarella sneaks her revolver into its feather pants. 20. With a similar spirit, cyborgs of the 21st century that lose control are conquered or humanized and restored by love, as is most prominently at stake in Japanese anime: see, for example, Ch?jik? y osai Macross: Ai oboeteimasuka, by Noboru Ishigure and Sh?ji Kawamori (1984); Akira, by Katsuhiro ?moto (1988); FLCL, by Kazuya Tsurumaki (2000); Metoro porisu, by Rintaro, based on Osamu Tezuka's comic (2001); and Cardcaptor Sakura, by Clamp (2001). 21. "Himmelssehnsucht" is difficult to translate. It ex presses a longing for the "heavenly realms," while "Himmel" in German means both the sky and heaven (translation by Martha Blassnigg). Therefore this ex pression could also be translated to mean human en gagement with space exploration. Friedmar Apel, Himmelssehnsucht: Die Sichtbarkeit der Engel in der ro mantischen Literatur und Kunst sowie bei Klee, Rilke und Benjamin. (Paderborn, Germany: Igel-Verlag, 1994). 22.
