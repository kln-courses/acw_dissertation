<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARNOLD AND THE HERO-WORSHIP OF JESUS David Goslee Matthew Arnold opens a late essay by claiming "All roads, says the proverb, lead to Rome, and one finds in like manner that all questions raise the question of religion" ("Irish" 8.321). In this century, however, most roads through his own prose have scrupulously avoided what most critics have seen as the dead end of Arnold's religious thought. It is thus surpris- ing that of what has been written on it, so much is distinguished.1 Equally surprising, much of this criticism circles around a series of related para- doxes: Consider David DeLaura: "Arnold eventually developed a rich theology which continually strained against the metaphysical boundaries erected by his own intellectual honesty" ("apRoberts" 137).2 For William Robbins, he succeeds in resolving this tension: "Roped in by dogma, padlocked by logic, and shut up in a dark metaphysical cupboard, he would always escape Houdini-like, stroll back to the footlights, and ur- banely tell the audience that such conventional bonds were child's play to a supple man of culture" (140). For Leon Gottfried, however, even such agility cannot save him: "there would seem to have been two paths open to him - that of Christianity or that of a thorough-going naturalism. Unable to choose, he bent his mightiest efforts towards a reconciliation of the two, and so ended his years impaled, but with a minimum of discomfort, upon both horns of the dilemma" (209).3 What all these accounts recognize, I think, is a gap between the emotional richness of Arnold's religious sensi- bilities and the positivistic world view in which he tried to situate them. Arnold himself remained unfazed, almost unaware of this dilemma, so I want to argue in this paper, only because he had quietly transferred it to a heroically reconstituted image of Jesus. And from this figure, Arnold won R&amp;L28A (Spring 1996) 21</page><page sequence="2">22 Religion &amp; Literature many of the rewards which Thomas Carlyle had earlier sought from his heroes. Such an attribution may seem both far-fetched and unnecessary; John Kent, for example, has grouped Arnold's Jesus with other contemporary Protestant efforts to replace the orthodox incarnation of impersonal, transcendent power with a specific, culturally contingent, human figure (42-43).4 Yet Catherine Runcie cautions that far from "a redaction in little of the numerous lives of Jesus that flourished as rebuttals to Strauss,... Arnold's Christ is not... just another model of virtue in a humanist pantheon" (39). While Arnold creates his own heroic pantheon to set himself above popular religion and culture (Tillotson 143-44; DeLaura, Hebrew 28-32), he hedges, displaces, discredits virtually all of these figures, lest they usurp an independence upon which he staked his very identity. Instead of robbing him of power, however, his Jesus is invested with a power which only Arnold can use. In thus fusing the older orthodox and the newly "critical" images of Jesus, in fusing transcendent power and human personality, Arnold has no viable paradigm available to him except that of Carlyle's hero. To be sure, Arnold labored to extricate himself from Carlyle's influence. He specifically reoriented German literary history toward the "modern" Heine and away from the romantics celebrated by Carlyle ("Heine" 3.108); he asserted in the Emerson essay that happiness, not Carlyle's Calvinistic duty,5 must motivate human action (Tillotson 146);6 he may even have cast Carlyle into the role of the romantic madman in "A Summer Night" (Tillotson 147). Taken together, his various repudiations echo Clough's complaint to Emerson that "Carlyle has led us all out into the desert and left us there" (cited in Livingston 24). The exhaustive studies by Tillotson, Neiman, and DeLaura have indeed established that Carlyle continued to influence Arnold long after his increasing reactionary politics prompted a public dissociation. Yet even DeLaura states that in Arnold's religious essays, "Carlyle was able to offer him very little aid" ("Arnold" 124). If I maintain that - here especially - Carlyle's hero-worship afforded him a great deal of aid, I am seconded by Ruth apRoberts: "Carlyle's discreet tracing of Odin's deification is a rough model for Arnold's tracing of Jesus' deification" (Arnold and God 225). As she develops this parallel in more recent work on Carlyle, however, she takes it in a more questionable direction: "Carlyle, for all his sounding so religious, was in fact exploding the supernaturalist Christian myth. Matthew Arnold, I believe, under- stood perfectly. He holds that a nonsupernaturalist religion such as Carlyle's is legitimate.... Carlyle demythologizes the Odin material as Arnold is to</page><page sequence="3">DAVID GOSLEE 23 do with the Jesus material in God and the Bible'9 ("Natural" 27).7 While both Carlyle and Arnold were equally uncomfortable with the supernatural in general and the divinity of Christ in particular, apRoberts here demytholo- gizes rather too indiscriminately. In tying both authors to an enlighten- ment, primarily German model of secular spiritual growth or Bildung, she obviates the need for any sort of hero - and it is precisely the hero that the disappearance of God makes necessary. Both Victorian and modern critics have argued, moreover, that Carlyle creates Odin, not as a stand-in for Jesus, but as a more viable alternative. According to DeLaura, for ex- ample, "Gilfillan... saw that Carlyle had openly revealed 'the foregone conclusion,... long ago reached,' that 'he loves Christianity as little as he does its clergy'" ("Religious" 131). In 1887, Richard Holt Hutton claimed that "Carlyle's mind habitually adhered by preference to the Scandinavian type of violent smoke-and-flame hero... at the root of Carlyle's transcen- dental scepticism was a certain contempt for the raw material of human nature... [sis if Christianity] had something too much of love in it, some- thing slightly mawkish" (27, 35).8 For Carlyle, the hero bridged the gap yawning between the Everlasting No and the Everlasting Yea of Sartor Resartus. In the first Carlyle could assert himself in heroic defiance, but only in the face of a dead, unmean- ing, machine-like universe. In the second he could again find meaning and purpose in that universe, but only at the cost of renouncing individual desire in the service of selfless duty. His more cosmic heroes, however, can comprehend, seize, humanize this cosmos by a self-positing, self-defining act of will. As DeLaura puts it, his "images suggest that truth is not objective, pre-existent, waiting for its recorder; instead, it is found as part of the act or process of artistic creation itself: prophecy discovers and perhaps even creates truth.... This is Carlyle's central, and modern, insight that truth is, in a fundamental sense, correlative to personal quest, very nearly a function of personality and moral disposition" ("Ishmael" 711). From this benefit, others accrue: First, the gap between appearance and reality disappears: "Insight into the great Original Fact of Existence brings Belief in the Fact, disbelief in Semblances. Indeed, Insight and Belief are identical, since the Hero is aware of Truth which under the compulsion of his quality he cannot but believe in" (Lehman 54). Second, the universe of German Idealism reacquires a human face: "Fichte starts with the Divine Idea and exemplifies it in a hero; Carlyle starts with a hero and clothes him with emotive language, which is often flavored with Fichtean idealism" (Bentley 67-68).9 Instead of the hero stepping in, rather like Housman's mercenaries, to compensate for the disappearance of God, God obligingly</page><page sequence="4">24 Religion &amp; Literature disappears to make room for the hero.10 Third, the hero, while creating his own rules, even his own truth, becomes a specifically human object of worship for the unquestioning multitude: "Carlyle was no longer a 'theist' in the traditional sense. But if he needed no personal god, he needed, at least, a personal hero" (Cassirer 207). n Fourth, while transcending society and history, the hero can transform both in his own image.12 Finally, as several modern commentators have pointed out, Carlyle could participate, actively if vicariously, in the divine afflatus of his heroes: The lecture format of Heroes "evoke [d] from him his profoundest exploration of the prophet's mission: the prophet's credentials, his message, and his special mode of utterance.... The ultimate hero of the Heroes lectures, as well as the source of its unity, is Thomas Carlyle: he is implicitly the chief charac- ter, and the work is nearly as autobiographical as Book II of Sartor" (DeLaura, "Ishmael" 717-18). Yet how was Arnold to buy into Carlyle's hero without buying into the primitivism, the nostalgia, the violence, the autocracy? The difficulty of this undertaking may explain what DeLaura describes as the cautious, tentative nature of his religious development: While the generation of the 1850s turned away from Carlyle and into domesticity, "It is Arnold's own remarkable independence of viewpoint. . . that allowed him to work out his own position more slowly, and to profit variously from Carlyle's example" ("Religious" 1 32-33, 140). Carlyle himself had refused to develop Jesus as a hero: "The greatest of all Heroes is One - whom we do not name here! Let sacred silence meditate that scared matter; you will find it the ultimate perfection of a principle extant throughout man's whole history on earth" (Heroes 1 1-1 2).13 Faced with the task of reinterpreting both Jesus and the hero so as to reconcile them one with another, Arnold resorted to a curiously anachronistic expedient which Carlyle had invoked thirty years earlier. Even though Muhammad lived six centuries after Jesus, Carlyle implicitly treats him and his theology as the moral precursor to Christian- ity. In like manner, within St. Paul and Protestantism, Arnold first engages Jesus through his most influential follower, but he treats Paul throughout as a stand-in for John the Baptist. Borrowing from Bloom's anxiety of influence, Leslie Brisman has in- cluded such anachronism within Arnold's larger strategy of usurping the primacy of biblical narrative and biblical history by positing his own ethical norms at the origins within a characteristically romantic etiological myth. By creating his own fictive truths, Arnold can authorize his own role as prophet and bard; by simultaneously displacing these truths, he can avoid direct Oedipal confrontation with his literary, ethical, religious, historical tradition.14 Specifically, he can superimpose his own vision of lost</page><page sequence="5">DAVID GOSLEE 25 theological fullness upon Thomas Arnold's vision of history as progressive. Within this framework, Paul can remain the follower of Jesus, struggling to maintain the purity of his master's vision against the encroaching tide of superstition: "Back rolled over the human soul the mist which the fires of Paul's spiritual genius had dispersed for a few short years" (6.70). Yet because Paul also remains lost in this "mist" - in a superstition which predates him, Jesus, history itself - Paul himself stands both before and after Jesus. To the extent that he speculates on God's purposes in passing over his fellow Jews, Arnold can even see him as enthralled, not by his own age, but by the yet-distant Reformation: "This is Calvinism, and St. Paul undoubtedly falls into it" (60). l5 If Paul can be trapped in superstition by the past and can type one kind of future, he can be freed from superstition by yet a different future: "if he had been asked whether he held the doctrine of the resurrection in the physical and miraculous sense,... he would have replied with entire con- viction that he did. . . . [Yet] 'below the stream. . . of what we think we feel - there flows. . . The central stream of what we feel indeed'; and by this alone are we truly characterized" (51). Here the true Pkul is discovered through Arnold's own poem, "The Buried Life," through which Arnold has earlier discovered his own true self. This remarkable internalization may explain Arnold's later insistence that Paul cannot be found within history or geography, within time or space: Every one who has been at Rome has been taken to see the Church of St. Paul.... Gold glitters and marbles gleam, but man and his movement are not there.... There is Paul, alone with the mystery which was hidden from ages and from generations, which was brought to the light by him for some half score years, and which was buried with him in his grave! Not in our day will he relive.... [Yet] The doctrine of Paul will arise out of the tomb where for centuries it has lain buried; it will edify the church of the future. (70-71) By first predicting and then envisioning Paul's resurrection, Arnold may, as Brisman claims, "be said to be daemonized into the status of a poet- prophet" (9). As with Carlyle and his heroes, however, Arnold can win this role only by first conferring a heroic role upon Paul. From the more derivative, liminal heroism of Paul,1* Arnold can then work through the increasingly detailed portraits of Jesus in literature and Dogma and into the most intimate, most fully internalized visions of the cosmic Jesus of John in God and the Bible. Throughout this process, however, Arnold remains just as reticent as Carlyle about presenting Jesus as an immediately recognizable hero. To trace his features accurately, therefore, we need to trace a series of three sequences: In each of them, Arnold</page><page sequence="6">26 Religion &amp; Literature makes what appear as largely unfounded claims; in each, however, we can align these claims with comparable ones made for an heroic Jesus. In the match thus created, we can see Arnold's position as justified and Arnold himself as vested with the kind of power which Brisman finds in him. None of these sequences may make his positions any more convincing or his essays any more palatable to a "disinterested" reader; yet by showing the anomalies incorporated within the figure of Jesus, we can show Arnold's other claims shaping themselves around him. Within the first of these sequences, really an extension of the temporal discontinuities we just encountered with Paul, Arnold makes what seem unsupported claims for the nature and direction of the /£#^j«j/, claims particularly dubious in their insistence upon empirical, "scientific" sup- port. Turning to Arnold's Jesus, however, we find an analogous transcen- dence of historical contingency, a transcendence which enables him - like Carlyle's heroes - to shape history instead of being shaped by it. As Arnold employs his hermeneutical powers to project himself back into this figure, he wins a corresponding freedom to re-envision and reshape his own age. The second of these sequences addresses the attacks of Bradley, Trilling, and Robbins on Arnold's secularized, supposedly empirical vision of Chris- tian self-transcendence. This moral stance, obsessively rigid when seen in isolation, becomes humanized within Jesus' intensely personal relationship with his followers. By internalizing the rigors of his moral ideals, by self- consciously inhabiting the role of the suffering servant, Arnold's Jesus takes on the more romantic, heroic, Carlylean role of accepting, willing, and so justifying the injustice which history has thrust upon him. By thus adopt- ing self-denial as his means of self-assertion, he not only accepts and incorporates Arnold's own dilemma, he enables him to proclaim this moral vision from a prophetic stance outside normal categories for truth and falsehood. The third sequence accounts for our opening paradoxes, those gaps between the evident richness of Arnold's religious experience and the comparative poverty of his theological system. I would suggest that his careful reduction of God to an expression of moral law reflects a continu- ing Oedipal struggle with his dead father. By insisting on Jesus' humanity, however, Matthew could award him the personal traits otherwise denied within his theology. Although Jesus thus accrues enough personal power to become the covert object of Arnold's worship, this worship remains not just humanistic but implicitly romantic in that its object both reflects and extends the believing self.</page><page sequence="7">DAVID GOSLEE 27 No one could deny that Arnold's handling of the Zeitgeist throughout his career was innovative, perceptive, and sophisticated. Even his religious essays are studded with telling insights: he includes both loss and progres- sion within a biblical history made up of sudden ethical breakthroughs followed by gradual regressions into corruption, complacency, and super- stition (L&amp;D 205-13);17 he acknowledges that "the growth of... religion, does not exactly proceed with vigour and rigour; rather it follows an order of development loose and wavering" (G&amp;B 7.205);18 he delights in "the chagrin and manifest perplexity" of contemporary "secularists, at having to reckon with religion again when they thought... a kind of new gospel, half Bentham, half Cobden... was coming in" ("Church" 8.78). I9 Finally, anticipating the supposedly modern discovery of paradigm shifts by more than a century, Arnold can observe that a new opinion "comes to look differently to us, as we look at it by the light of fresh knowledge. We are not beaten from our old opinion by logic, we are not driven off our ground; - our ground itself changes with us" (L&amp;D 6. 168). As we saw in his account of Paul, however, Arnold's most dramatic invocations of the Zeitgeist carry an aura of medieval magic counter to the very spirit he hopes to invoke. Returning to his undergraduate encounter with Butler's Analogy, he admits that it "seemed once to have a spell and a power; but the Z^t-Geist breathes upon it, and we rub our eyes, and it has the spell and the power no longer. It has the effect upon me, as I contem- plate it, of a stately and severe fortress, with thick and high walls, built of old to control the kingdom of evil; - but the gates are open and the guards gone" ("Bishop" 8.57-58). Such anachronism is only exacerbated by his frequent appeals to "science" and "verification." He dismisses biblical literalism because "For science, the spiritual notion is the real one, the material notion is figurative" (P&amp;P 6.55). This appeal to a science which can affirm spiritual notions has produced widespread critical skepticism: "Arnold consistently strives to be as 'scientific' as he can possibl[y] be, and there isn't much 'science' to apply. The best he can do is refer to his own experience and to the accumulated experience of literature and its critics, of which his own knowledge was vast. He fastened on likely interpreta- tions, and good hunches" (apRoberts, Arnold and God 237). If Arnold reinterprets his own age so curiously, however, can he be trusted to interpret the vast historical and cultural movements which produced it? Fraser Neiman notes that as Arnold moved into his religious</page><page sequence="8">28 Religion &amp; Literature essays, Zeitgeist changed from a force entrapping him and his age into one whose movements he could predict and in whose course he could partici- pate (982-93). As Hutton put it in the 1880s, on Arnold "there sits the exhilaration which speaks of difficulties surmounted and a world that is either fast coming, or, in the thinker's opinion, must soon come, over to his side" (103). Yet both critics question whether Arnold can continue to claim objective, even cosmic status for a power with which he identifies so intimately. As Neiman summarizes, "The figure... suggested] a philo- sophic belief about human history that.Arnold now inclined to favor, but which he declined to assert in terms of any more binding philosophical proposition" (989). As early as the essay on Spinoza's Tractates, however, Arnold had en- countered ajesus who could comprehend, transcend, and thus manipulate the Zeitgeist even while positioned within it. In Arnold's summary, "Christ, who beheld the decrees of God as God himself beholds them, - as eternal truths, - proclaimed the love of God and the love of our neighbours as commands, only because of the ignorance of the multitude" ("Spinoza" 3.164-65). Just as Carlyle's heroes rend the cultural veil to offer their followers new spiritual insights, so all of Arnold's idiosyncratic New Testa- ment criticism presupposes an analogous discrepancy between Jesus' own self-image and those imposed upon him by his disciples: "His reporters, in short, are the servants of the Scripture-letter, Jesus is its master" (L&amp;D 6.263).20 As master - as prototype of the romantic genius in general and the Carlylean hero in particular - he makes his own rules. If Jesus, unlike these heroes, cannot fully impose his rules and his vision upon history, he reaffirms his greatness simply by enduring the resulting incomprehension: For the more the reporters were fallible and prone to delusion, the more does Jesus become independent of the mistakes they made, and unaffected by them. We have plain proof that here was a very great spirit; and the greater he was, the more certain were his disciples to misunderstand him. The depth of their misunder- standing of him is really a kind of measure of the height of his superiority. (L&amp;D 6.258) Because this superiority remains, to reinterpret Arnold's figure, immeasur- able, it can revalidate the Jesus of John's gospel. Arnold argues that the dismissal of his self-referential sayings by German higher critics only betokens "the strong reluctance of mankind to recognize the gulf between every great spirit and themselves.... Half of what any great spirit says is sure to be misapprehended by his hearers; much more than half of what Jesus said was sure to be misapprehended by his disciples" (G&amp;B 7.334).</page><page sequence="9">DAVID GOSLEE 29 Still later Arnold's reverence leads him to affirm his image of Jesus against the witness of the biblical text itself: "anything exaggerated, dis- torted, false, cannot be from Jesus;. . . it must be human perversion of him. There is always an appeal open, and a return possible, to the acknowl- edged sweet reason of Jesus" ("Preface" 8. 158-59). While we may long for the Jesus of Blake, who "acted from impulse, not from rules," Arnold's invocation of "sweet reason" carries him far beyond the enlightenment. Here Jesus' transcendence of historically mediated forms of thought im- plies a transcendence of time different from that in Carlyle. Carlyle scoffed at critics who dismiss the hero as "the 'creature of the Time'. . . ; the Time called him forth. . . . Alas, we have known Times call loudly enough for their great man; but not find him when they called!" (12-13). Arnold's Jesus cannot so cavalierly shape and define the age into which he is placed; nor can he span ages like the Christ of orthodoxy: "Who can... not feel that Jesus must have known, while he nevertheless persevered in saying them, how things, like: 'Before Abraham was, I am. . . ' would be misapprehended by those who heard them?" (L&amp;D 6.322). In the same breath that he denies Jesus such a preexistence, however, Arnold neatly replaces past duration with future duration, suggesting that Jesus remains a self-con- sciously 19th-century mind inhabiting a lst-century body. If Jesus can thus live simultaneously in two ages, so can Arnold; his "Christ, existing not just as an actual perfect man, but also as a presence in a text, has transfiguring power" (Runcie 42). Arnold may dispute, not very convincingly, the obvious criticism that he has been "pronouncing that whatever suits us shall be held to come from Jesus, and whatever does not suit us from his reporters" ("Preface" 8.161). Yet like his science, his hermeneutics remains heavily dependent upon an intuitive bond between himself and his subject: "Beyond the historic outlines of the life of Jesus,. . . much the firmest element in the record is his words. . . in his direct teaching we are on the surest ground in single sentences, which have their inefface- able and unforgettable stamp" (L&amp;D 6.270). As Brisman puts it, "Arnold assumes the mantle of the prophet, the true receiver of the spirit, who can divine the difference between the logos of Jesus and the deliberate inven- tions of the Evangelist" (7). In a post-modern extrapolation from this claim, Brisman suggests that we are all, authors and critics, caught in the web of texts, that to profess a particular faith is to privilege a particular language. For Arnold to invoke an "old" myth is thus to return to the paradigms of his own childhood. Any claimed identification with another age, another mindset, another subject becomes a priori delusive, although suggestively so.</page><page sequence="10">30 Religion &amp; Literature Despite their shared reliance on words, however, Arnold's own hermeneutic paradigm remained far more old-fashioned. Going back to Schleiermacher21 or, as Isaiah Berlin suggests (xvi-xix, 34-37), all the way back to Vico, it posited an imaginative mind-meld between interpreting subject and interpreted object, provided only that the empathy between them was strong enough. And with Jesus, Arnold's empathy has the firmest foundations; to quote apRoberts again, he "is saying Jesus is master of language, he is the right kind of literary critic" {Arnold and God 206). More than a critic, Arnold's Jesus is himself the master hermeneut, schooling his followers in proper exegesis: "... if you were really Abraham's children you would follow the truth like Abraham!" - this simple but profound line, sending Israel back to amend its conventional, barren notions of God, of righteousness, and of the founders of its religion... was, we say, at once too simple and too profound for the author of the Fourth Gospel to have invented. (L&amp;D 6.274) Within this complex sequence, Jesus' hermeneutic genius, too deep for John, becomes itself the proof text for Arnold's own hermeneutic genius.22 Within it as well, even Jesus' cautions on miracles can be read as self- revelations: "Who does not see what a clue they offer as to the real mind of Jesus?" (L&amp;D 6.262). In this context, Arnold's question becomes less rhetorical than it looks; by the time of God and the Bible, as we have seen, insight into Jesus' self-referential sayings is reserved for those already initiated into his "real mind": "There remained a number of bgia some- what profounder and more obscure, more over the heads of the disciples than the simpler bgia.... Of this kind were sayings in which Jesus spoke of his relation to the Father" (7.328). And with the Father reduced to an impersonal power, "it falls," according to Hutton, "from the secret of Jesus to the secret of Matthew Arnold" (116). Whether a fall or not, the two do coalesce; and within this cozy hermeneutic circle, when Arnold "describe [s] the work of Jesus Christ" in the phrase, "he came to restore the intuition" (L&amp;D 6.284), he is simultaneously describing a power which he possesses and the Germans do not: [Strauss] applies a negative criticism ably enough, but... to deal with the reality which is still left in the New Testament, requires a larger, richer, deeper, more imaginative mind than his.... In the German mind, as in the German language, there does seem to be something splay, something blunt-edged, unhandy and infelicitous. (L&amp;D 6. 1 58-59) A similar lack of cultured sophistication encumbers the efforts of the average believer: "he has not enough experience of the way in which men</page><page sequence="11">DAVID GOSLEE 31 have thought and spoken, to feel what the Bible-writers are about; to read between the lines, to discern where he ought to rest with his whole weight, and where he ought to pass lightly" (L&amp;D 6.152). The church establish- ment fares no better, needing the intervention of an outsider with inside hermeneutical sophistication: And you are masters in Israel, and know not these things; and you require a voice from the world of literature to tell them to you! Those who ask nothing better than to remain silent on such topics, who have to quit their own sphere to speak of them, who cannot touch them without being reminded that they survive those who touched them with far different power, you compel... to proclaim truths which it was your function to have made familiar. And, when you have thus forced the very stones to cry out, and the dumb to speak, you call them singular because they know these truths, and arrogant because they declare them. ("Stanley" 3.82) Though early, though splendidly polemic, this echo of John 3.10 is also remarkable for the number of powers the reluctant Arnold must assume and the roles he must play: foreigner, victim, prophet, Christ figure - and all of these because he knows Jesus as Jesus knows the Father. So positioned, Arnold can make good on the temporal claims he makes in St. Paul and Protestantism, claims not just to predict Paul's eventual triumph, but to know Paul's mind better than Paul himself and to discover future theologies implicit within it. Asked by his opponents, "Has it been left for you to bring in a new religion and found a new church?" (110), Arnold replies modestly, the version we propound of St. Paul's line of thought... belongs to the '£«/-(*«$/,' or time-spirit, it is in the air, and many have long been anticipating it, preparing it, setting forth this and that part of it. ... All we have done is to take it as a whole, and give a plain, popular, connected, exposition of it... our rendering of St. Paul's thought we conceive rather as of a product of nature. (Ill) Supporting his later identification of biblical religion with culture, he asserts, "it is not so much we who apprehend it as the 'Zeit-Geisf who discovers it to us" (L&amp;D 6.4 1 0). As Neiman puts it, the figures used "confer on th[is] term a nimbus, make it express a transcendental agency of intellectual change" (992). This nimbus, moreover, surrounds Arnold as well. Just as Carlyle clothed himself in the heroic attributes of his subjects (or, better, clothed them with his own intimations of the heroic), Jesus' appropriation of the Zptgeist shapes it for Arnold's wearing and Arnold's use. Hence even more confidently than for Paul, Arnold can prophesy the future of Jesus' teaching: he sees in him "a wonderful figure transcending his time, transcending his disciples,... planting his profound veins of</page><page sequence="12">32 Religion &amp; Literature thought in their memory along with their own notions and prepossessions, to come out all mixed up together, but still distinguishable one day and separable; - and leaving his word thus to bear fruit for the future" {L&amp;D 6.265). It can only bear fruit, however, for those able to envision this future on a suitably "immense scale": "He that cannot watch the God of the Bible, and the salvation of the Bible, gradually and on an immense scale discovering themselves and becoming, will insist on seeing them ready- made" {L&amp;D 6. 1 52). This pattern we have been tracing with Arnold's use of history - seemingly unfounded claims which are then grounded on similar claims made for the figure of Jesus - plays itself out again for Arnold's ethical norms. Here in particular Arnold is betrayed by his gradual extension of Spinoza. It is not simply, as Robbins claims, that Arnold tries to historicize values founded upon abstract reason; it is also that within Spinoza's breathtaking monism, all the classic philosophic dichotomies collapse: knowing and doing coalesce because the good life is the life of pure contemplation. Once Arnold reemphasizes emotion in the religious life, however, he not only immerses Spinoza within history, he imposes upon him a three-fold faculty psychology. As Robbins puts it (129), Arnold gets into trouble when the true self of the poetry becomes the best self of the essays without losing its claims to be true; here he is in effect forcing an unproven metaphysic upon the world.23 Occasionally Arnold himself ac- knowledges this fact-value dichotomy to be just that: "The two percep- tions, Righteousness tendeth to life, and, The ungodly prosper in the world, are left confronting one another like Kantian antinomies" {L&amp;D 6.207). Usually, however, he insists on the universality of the moral laws he finds celebrated in Oedipus at Colonus, "laws which in the highest heaven had their birth, neither did the race of mortal man beget them, or shall oblivion ever put them to sleep; the power of God is mighty in them, and groweth not old!" {L&amp;D6A78).24 Arnold has himself encountered similar objections: "It is said, again," he admits, that his definition of God as "the eternal, - that which never had a beginning, and can never have an end, - is a metaphysical concep- tion not given by experience." Rather defensively he counters that there is "only [one] sound sense in which we can call the law of righteousness, or the law of gravitation. . . eternal. . . from all that we hear or can make out it holds good; and we believe, therefore, that it will go on holding good" {G&amp;B 7.192). Rather like Don Quixote testing his helmet, however, he shies away from inspecting this belief too critically: "Neither will we now set about proving that experientially righteousness is salvation. ... It is easy to dispute the[se claims], to find things which seem to go against them; yet,</page><page sequence="13">DAVID GOSLEE 33 on the whole, they prove themselves." He finally succeeds in eliminating the doubt by the simple expedient of eliminating the doubter: "But if any man is. . . so subjugated by the conviction that facts are clean against the[se claims],. . . for him Literature and Dogma was not written" (G&amp;B 7.230).25 Arnold's critics have been quick to point out that in empirical terms, eternity is a very long time. In 1887, anticipating Huxley's later, darker moralizing, Hutton noted that "if the earth came to an end,... then the enduring stream of tendency would endure no longer, and 'the eternal' would, so far as it was verifiable, sink back into a transitory and extinct phenomenon of the terrestrial past" (108). Making a similar point in 1964, Cockshut turns one of Arnold's own claims against him. While reappropriating Newman's theory of religious development, Arnold had smugly dismissed his efforts to ground it in dogma: "Born into the world twenty years later, and touched with the breath of the C£eit-Geist,' how would this exquisite and delicate genius have been himself the first to feel the unsoundness of all this" (L&amp;D 6.377). Refocusing on Arnold's suppos- edly naturalistic morality, Cockshut asks, "what advantage might not a man born in 1840 have over both? Thomas Hardy was born in 1840, and he thought there was a general tendency in the universe making against righteousness" (61). Besides being philosophically dubious, Arnold's ethics have been found excessively, even obsessively rigid. His principle objection to Methodism is that Wesley's notion of Christ's expiation (P&amp;P 6.84-85) may short circuit the gradual operations of moral regeneration: "A company of Cornish revivalists will have no difficulty in tasting, seeing, hearing, and feeling God, twenty times over, to-night, and yet may be none the better for it to- morrow morning" (P&amp;P 6.46). While dismissing the more magical senses of expiation in the Old Testament, he insists that a third, moral sense remains relevant: "fire and the knife, cautery and amputation, are often necessary in order to induce a vital action, which, if it were not for our corrupting past, we might have obtained from the natural healthful vigour of our moral organs" (P&amp;P 6.66).26 For Cockshut, "All his Hellenism, his self-imposed moderation, his progressive outlook were powerless to spoil for him the permanent appeal of the Old Testament conception of righ- teousness. One would have to go to a Covenanter or to Nietzsche to find a comparable exaltation" (69). The modernist priest George Tyrrell, seeking comparisons closer to home, "found something 'frigidly Anglican and respectable in Matthew Arnold's "righteousness" as the characteristic of the Divinity.' It is a 'sort of university God, a personification of the Nicomachean ethics'" (cited in Robbins 210).</page><page sequence="14">34 Religion &amp; Literature While Arnold's God, as we will see shortly, is rigorously kept from personifying anything, his Jesus is anything but donnish; he shapes himself into a very personal, very heroic moral agent. As we have seen, Arnold read demythologizing German criticism back into Jesus, making him self- consciously compensate for the anthropomorphic mindset of his disciples. Here, analogously, he appropriates the suffering servant in Second Isaiah, and instead of attributing the parallels between it and Jesus to the evange- lists, he attributes them to Jesus himself: "This ideal... Jesus had adopted and elevated as the true ideal of Israel's saviour; he had corrected by it the favourite popular ideals he found regnant" (L&amp;D 6.3 19). Besides correcting popular morality, Jesus' decision to sacrifice himself to his own ideal, to become both its exemplar and its victim, imbues his life with a romantic tragedy beyond the reach of Carlyle's Odin. Where that figure underwent an impressive but delusive apotheosis, Arnold's Jesus harbors no such illusions. Here Arnold's Christology may seem to collapse into that of his friend Clough in "Easter Day II": "In the true Creed /. . . / Christ is yet risen." Yet where Clough's Jesus is constructed by his follow- ers, Arnold's Jesus comes to fore-know not just his death but the vicarious nature of his resurrection: To the mind of Jesus, his own 'resurrection' after a short sojourn in the grave was the victory of his cause after his death and at the price of his death. His disciples materialized his resurrection, and their version of the matter falls day by day to ruin. But no ruin or contradiction befalls the version of Jesus himself. He has risen, his cause has conquered; the course of events continually attests his resurrection and victory. (G&amp;B 7.371) Through Arnold's hermeneutic powers, Jesus' mind can live for us; yet no realization of this victory can live in Jesus. The continued "life" of Arnold's Jesus, however, remains far richer than this statement would imply. It is not just that his ethics, like his beliefs, remain true, but rather that he remains fully and irrevocably identified with them. As Arnold acknowledged in his essay on Dr. Stanley, "Religious life resides not in an incessant movement of ideas, but in a feeling which attaches itself to certain fixed objects. The religious life of Christendom has thus attached itself to the acts, and words, and death of Christ" ("Stanley" 3.67). Here this particular attachment sounds only fortuitous; by the time of the religious essays, it is inevitable. As moral agent, Jesus intervenes on his followers' behalf to "step between us foolish transgressors and the destructive natural consequences of our transgression, and, by a superhuman example, a spending himself without stint. . . to save the ideal of human life and conduct" (P&amp;P 6.66).27 His ethical teaching then pen-</page><page sequence="15">DAVID GOSLEE 35 etrates his followers deeply enough to reshape their identity: "he made them feel that they had a best and real self as opposed to their ordinary and apparent one.... Then to find his own soul, his true and permanent self, became set up in man's view as his chief concern, as the secret of happi- ness" (L&amp;D 6.220). Earlier Arnold had mediated this tension between self-assertion and self-transcendence through the example of Spinoza. There the selfless contemplation of God could fulfill him as both an intellectual and a moral agent. Here Arnold's Jesus becomes both agent and object of a further reconciliation. The "death" of one's ordinary self leaves one's best self very much intact, but now even this self can be modelled on and actively directed toward Jesus: the disciples of Jesus were not told to believe in his method, or to believe in his secret, but to believe in him;. . . they were told: "Follow me\" For it was only by fixing their heart and mind on Jesus that they could learn to use the method and secret right; by "feeding on him," by, as he often said "remaining in him." (L&amp;D 6.30 1)28 Arnold is happy to follow German criticism in acknowledging that after Jesus' death, "the very air and aspect of things seem to tell us we are in wonderland.... [The New Testament narrators] really say to us: Behold a legend growing under your eyes!" (L&amp;D 6.256). Yet he steadfastly refuses to acknowledge that his own devotion to and identification with Jesus might itself reflect any later development. Through the "profounder" logia of John, as we saw, Arnold's Jesus opens himself to the inner circle of his followers. I think it no coincidence that as Arnold gradually identifies with the ethical Jesus, he comes to assume a specifically ethical prophetic vision.29 Among his increasingly puritanical pronouncements, none has been more derided than his condemnation of the French for their sexual laxity, "the ideal of I'komme sensuel moyen" (e.g. Trilling 344-46): All of us feel, at some time or other in our lives, a hankering after the French ideal.... La Boheme, the ideal, free, pleasurable life of Paris, is a kind of Paradise of Ishmaels. . . . And again and again he [Ishmael] seems drawing near to a worldwide success, nay, to have succeeded; - but always, at this point, disaster overtakes him, he signally breaks down. ... Plausible and attractive as it may be, the constitution of things turns out to be somehow or other against it. (L&amp;D 6.390-92) This passage climaxes an extended historical analysis of immorality as socially debilitating (L&amp;D 386-92); and since all the cultures which have succumbed to it have perished, France would logically seem to be next in line. Yet as Trilling sagely points out (358), the cultures which have not</page><page sequence="16">36 Religion &amp; Literature succumbed have perished just as surely. On the surface, Arnold's judgment on France begins to look suspiciously like a guilty judgment on his own free-spirited and francophile youth. At bottom, however, Arnold's quest for purity arises from religious as well as psychological motives. In The Idea of a University (169-78), Newman wrestled with an English advocate of free living and free thinking, Lord Shaftesbury. When Arnold confronts Shaftesbury's supposition "of a man thinking vice and selfishness to be truly as much for his advantage as virtue and benevolence..., the result is not," Arnold insists, "that he goes on just as well without [a conscience]; the result is that he is lost" ("Bishop" 8.43). The weight given this last word, in excess of any empirical referent, suggests that Arnold is here envisioning some fall from grace, from the intimate identification with the ethical Jesus of God and the Bible. Not until a late essay, however, can Arnold fully articulate his judgment on France within a prophetic perspective: No doubt to most of us, if we had been there to see it,. . . the society of Samaria and Jerusalem, would have seemed to contain a great deal else besides dissolute grandees and foolish common people. No doubt we should have thought parts of their policy serious, and some of their alliances promising. No doubt, when we read the Hebrew prophets now,... we often feel the blame and invective to be too absolute. ("Numbers" 10.148) In our judgments upon contemporary society, in other words, we see not too little but too much. Meanwhile, "the philosophers and prophets main- tain that these matters [of righteousness], do really govern politics and save or destroy States. . . by a silent, inexorable fatality; while the politicians are making believe, plausibly and noisily" (10.152). Like Jesus and the proph- ets before him, like Carlyle's Mahomet, Arnold can hear this silence; like Carlyle the historian, he can see that where Israel had gone whoring after false gods, contemporary France has turned lust into a goddess: Lubricity "eats like a canker.... Hardness and insolence come in its train..., a hardness which grows until the man can at last scarcely take pleasure in anything, outside the service of his goddess.... Such are the fruits of the worship of the great goddess Aselgeia" (10.160).30 While this judgment might grow out of Proverbs, the next one is more openly prophetic: things will only go from bad to worse with [France]; she will more and more lose her powers of soul and spirit, her intellectual productiveness, her skill in counsel, her might for war, her formidableness as a foe, her value as an ally, and the life of the famous State will be more and more impaired, until it perish. And this is that hard but true doctrine of the sages and prophets. (10. 161)</page><page sequence="17">DAVID GOSLEE 37 In this transparent reference to the Franco-Prussian war, Arnold may seem to echo Carlyle's late rediscovery of his heroic ideal within the German military. Within his broader, more prophetic perspective, however, Arnold redescribes France's humiliating defeat as a new Babylonian captivity: France "must recover through a powerful and profound renewal. . . brought about by 'the remnant' amongst her people" (10.162).31 Our third sequence, because the final one, will seem more predictable because of its familiar pattern and the now-familiar outlines of Arnold's Jesus. In itself, however, this remains the most radical of the three - radical because of the gap, variously articulated at the beginning of this article, between the complexity of Arnold's religious sensibilities and the relative sterility of his positivistic world view. Most affected by this gap is his image of God. As we have seen, Arnold had great difficulty in main- taining that any "power not ourselves which makes for righteousness" could be detected within history. He has equal difficulty, however, in maintaining that any such power deserves divinity. At times he makes an excellent case for refusing to burden God with anthropomorphic at- tributes: "when we personify it and call it 'the moral and intelligent Governor of the universe,' we presently find it not to be a person as man conceives of person, nor moral as man conceives of moral, nor intelligent as man conceives of intelligent, nor a governor as man conceives of governors" (L&amp;D 6.188).32 Such passages support DeLaura's claim that "Carlyle and Arnold were the true agnostics of the century, who refused to speculate on the nature of God" ("Religious" 141). Many more passages, however, support DeLaura's earlier claim that Arnold "firmly refused to repent of" the charge that he did not believe in a personal God. This conscious depersonalization produces arguments like the follow- ing: "by the light of this discovery [that God is the power not ourselves which makes for righteousness] we read and understand all the expressions that follow. Jesus comes forth from enduring Power that makes for righ- teousness, is sent by this Power, is this Power's Son; the Holy Spirit proceeds from this same Power, and so on" (L&amp;D 6.374-5). This effort to naturalize the Trinity remains almost as grotesque as his own famous caricature of the orthodox Trinity as "three Lord Shaftesburys" (L&amp;D 575n-578n). Though he assures one of his critics, a M. Reville, "that we do not profess to have discovered the nature of God to be impersonal, nor do</page><page sequence="18">38 Religion &amp; Literature we deny to God conscious intelligence" (G&amp;B 7.160), he mentions in passing that the critic has found him "decidedly too much afraid of the idea of the personality of God" (161). And this suggestion of fear, in turn, raises the possibility that Arnold's theology remains bound to his complex relations with his minister father. While Brown, Trilling, and others have traced strong (Edipal conflicts within Arnold's poetry, they concur that the break between "Sohrab and Rustum" and "Rugby Chapel" measures Matthew's reconciliation with Thomas and his mission. The religious essays, then, would represent Matthew's acceptance of his Father's mantle and his charge to lead the wavering masses "On, to the City of God" (I. 208). Certainly Arnold's letters to his mother constantly reassure her that "Papa" would have approved of one or another of his positions. Yet as we saw in Matthew's treatment of history, his claims of fidelity to the biblical tradition, however suspect, must challenge his father's liberal progressivism. Even more alarm- ing, adopting the progressive model itself would imply that his opinions have superseded those of his father. This much Matthew himself acknowl- edges: in him his father's mistrust of miracle and abhorrence of dogma have reached their logical conclusions. Matthew's depersonalization of God as Father, however, may suggest that his (Edipal conflict remains far from settled; although long dead, Thomas cannot be safely put to rest as long as his personal attributes find themselves perpetuated in a supernatu- ral surrogate.33 Up to this point, explaining Arnold's theology as a family romance remains tantamount to explaining it away. As Runcie puts it, "this notion of divinity without 'personality' (to use Coleridge's word)... cannot make [his] religion Christian. [And yet] Arnold's Christology can and it does" (40). While Runcie focuses on his Christ as a Platonic ideal, I find it more profitable to see in his Jesus a curious amalgam of Marcion and Feuerbach. After stripping God of the powers falsely attributed to him, Arnold reas- signs them, not to a divinized Christ or to an idealized humanity,34 but to a defiantly human Jesus: "Christendom with perfect justice has made him the Messiah, because he alone took, when his nation was on another and a false track,. . . the one only possible way. . . to bring in everlasting righteousness" (L&amp;D 6.214). The fact that the true track was obscure, that Jesus had to rediscover it, allows Arnold to suggest - very tentatively - that like him Jesus has had to usurp his father's place in order to salvage his mission: "If the idea of righteousness was changed, this implied, undoubtedly, a corre- sponding change in the idea of the Power that makes for righteousness; but in this manner only, and to this extent, does the teaching of Jesus re-define</page><page sequence="19">DAVID GOSLEE 39 the idea of God" (L&amp;D 6.286). As Carlyle engineered the disappearance of God to make room for his heroes, so here Arnold engineers the depersonalization of God to make psychological room for his heroically recuperated Jesus. We still need to ask whether here, as in most other usurpations, the new monarch comes to take on the attributes of the old. Once Arnold's Jesus has been awarded an implicitly transcendent power over history and moral evil, can he escape assuming the role traditionally given him in orthodox Christianity? Though DeLaura, as we saw, considered Arnold one of the "true agnostics of the century," he also claims that his "chief means for securing [religious] serenity, and the center of his theology, was his richly developed Christology" ("Religious" 144). This quandary is only intensified by two late passages. The first, concluding "A Psychological Parallel," "summarizes" Jesus' teachings in a strange palimpsest heavily laced with Jesus' transcendent self-pronouncements in John ("Psychologi- cal" 8.143). The second passage Arnold added to the popular edition of Literature and Dogma in 1883: Jesus himself, as he appears in the Gospels,... is, in the jargon of modern philoso- phy, an absolute; we cannot explain him, cannot get behind him and above him, cannot command him. He is therefore the perfection of an ideal, and it is as an ideal that the divine has its best worth and reality. (L&amp;D 6. 145) Extrapolating from this passage, Robbins offers this careful assessment of Jesus' nature and role in Arnold's religious life and thought: he comes to invest Jesus the exemplar with a human-divine perfection that is and will probably remain unique, yet is sufficiently realizable in human experience to offer humanity an ideal in the reality of which they can believe.... Both his God and his Christ reveal a kind of "relative absolutism," and the fact that this is a contradiction in terms leaves Arnold vulnerable. (138) From the perspective of humanity's religious needs, Robbins argues, Jesus and God share the same function and the same philosophical vulnerability. From the perspective of Arnold's own psychological needs, however, his Jesus may become unique in a different sense. By humanizing a figure traditionally seen as divine, Arnold may be re-enacting Keats's rescue of his Psyche from a failing classical pantheon into a new temple built "In some untrodden region of my mind" (1. 51). Arnold's fidelity to Spinoza, his insistence that nature cannot be transcended, forces him to argue that Jesus' ability to heal "is not what people are fond of calling the supernatu- ral. ... It is, on the contrary, like the grace of Raphael, or the grand style of</page><page sequence="20">40 Religion &amp; Literature Phidias, eminently natural; but it is above common, low-pitched nature. It is a line of nature not yet mastered or followed out" (L&amp;D 6.255). As religion itself inhabits the "tinge" which emotion gives to morality, so Arnold's Jesus inhabits the edges of Arnold's own discourse; his presence "bathes," "charms," plays with a lambent grace around otherwise stolid and solid reality, offering it a slight possibility of magical transformation. Charles Taylor has noted that ever since the Renaissance, the progressive objectification of nature has been balanced by an equally gradual effort to liberate the perceiving subject (6-25). So too here, Arnold may compensate for his positivistic cosmos and his depersonalized God by withdrawing personality into a psychological sanctuary where it can be properly safe- guarded, cherished, and celebrated. Although Arnold's own "religion [of] inward feeling" has been noted and appreciated by most of his commentators, he remains remarkably reticent about expressing it. Perhaps the clearest such expression is in- spired by his favorite devotional work, Thomas a Kempis' Imitation of Christ™ Facilities and felicities, - whence do they come? suggestions and stimulations, - where do they tend? hardly a day passes but we have some experience of them. And so Henry Moore was led to say, that "there was something about us that knew better, often, what we would be at than we ourselves." . . .So that we may most truly say, with the author of the Imitation: "Left to ourselves, we sink and perish; visited, we lift up our heads and live." And we may well give ourselves, in grateful and devout self-surrender, to that by which we are thus visited. So much is there incalculable, so much that belongs to not ourselves, in conduct. (L&amp;D 6. 18 1)36 While this passage does not identify the source of these suggestions, stimulations, visitations,37 it is hard to imagine their arising - or Arnold submitting to them - from some impersonal law. Here a contemporary observation of Newman suggests itself: "if, on doing right, we enjoy the same... delight which follows on our receiving praise from a father, we certainly have within us the image of some person. . . we are not affection- ate towards a stone" {Grammar 76). For Newman, that person was a specifically paternal God; for Arnold, we should look instead to the full title of the De Imitatio Christi. As we saw earlier, "the disciples of Jesus were not told to believe in his method, or to believe in his secret, but to believe in him" (L&amp;D 6.301). We should thus look for the primary locus of Arnold's devotion in the complex figure of Jesus, whom he has intuited, discovered, created with such tender care. University of Tennessee</page><page sequence="21">DAVID GOSLEE 41 NOTES 1. Perhaps, as R. H. Super argues, "professors are a little like clergymen: they do not devote themselves to a writer without some conviction that he is worth the devotion; but if, in the end, the conviction has grown tepid, they dare not face the world without pretend- ing that it is warmer than ever" (89). 2. And earlier, "Arnold's position is logically vulnerable.... But it remains close to the implicit religious position of a large number of 'humanistically' oriented people in the West who have not simply broken with man's religious past" (DeLaura, "Religious" 146). Probing this apparent inconsistency, Stephen Prickett writes, "It is, ironically, the very success of [Arnold's] attempt at reconciling two fundamentally polarized lines of thought that gives his writing such a curiously self-contradictory style. One is constantly dogged by the feeling that he is trying to have his cake and eat it" (218). 3. A. O. J. Cockshut offers perhaps the most sensitive formulation of the dilemma itself: "alone. . . in England, Arnold seems to feel the psychological impact of the Christian idea of death and resurrection in its full poignancy. Arnold is a lonely figure, for he is separated from Newman and Pusey by his conviction that miracles do not happen, and from Huxley and Herbert Spencer by his deeply-felt awareness of the meaning certain key miracles could have for man's soul" (63). 4. For Kent such accounts "did not necessarily lead to a 'gentle Jesus' meek and mild. In the writings of Renan and Matthew Arnold, for example, 'Jesus' has something of the mildness, the sympathy, the understanding and the ability to heal which suggest a kind of Wisdom figure" (42). Given Flavia Ayala's account of Arnold's earlier and largely unac- knowledged borrowings from Renan (560-66), La Vie de Jesus might seem a very likely source for Arnold's Jesus. But as Catherine Runcie notes, "Arnold ignores Renan's contention that Jesus later became harsh and strident" (41). 5. See Cassirer: "Carlyle's political theory is, at bottom, nothing short of a disguised and transformed Calvinism. True spontaneity is reserved to the few elect. As to the others, the mass of the reprobates, they have to submit under the will of these elect, the born rulers" (193). 6. As early as the essay "On Pagan and Medieval Religious Sentiment," in the first set of Essays in Criticism, he can claim that "It is this which made the fortune of Christianity, - its gladness, not its sorrow;... its drawing from the spiritual world a source of joy so abundant that it ran over upon the material world and transformed it" (3.230). But see DeLaura: "As Lewis Gates once put it, 'it would not be easy logically to distinguish [Carlyle's] Blessedness from the delight or happiness which Epictetus and Augustine admit as legitimate ends of human action.' And certainly all three men would condemn "the pursuit of happiness in any Epicurean sense" ("Arnold" 127). 7. She sees in Carlyle s Odin not just a model for Arnold s Jesus, but a covert relerence to the historical Jesus: "By his 'sacred silence' Carlyle... invites some to recognize that Christ is the subject of this lecture... the account of Odin's apotheosis from man to God is... written with great passion, precisely because it is written about Jesus" ("Natural" 24- 25). She argues that "There is little question that the Odin lecture was the inspiration for Arnold's poem 'Balder Dead.' . . . [Arnold] develops from Carlyle's cue the vision of Balder as Christ-figure" (18-19). 8. Among recent critics John Tanner speculates that Carlyle "may also have passed over Christ because he fails neatly to reflect clear heroic values" (151).</page><page sequence="22">42 Religion &amp; Literature 9. Odin's apotheosis, far from a demystification of the historical Jesus, remains thoroughly Blakean in its celebration of the romantic will. C. Stephen Finley argues: "Carlyle's lecture on 'The Hero as Divinity* resolves this paradox [of the passively suffering hero] only by destroying it: Christ as hero is only the best of the Odin-sort of divinity: 'Captain and Fighter; discerning with his wild flashing eyes what to do, with his wild lion-heart daring and doing it"' (29). See also Bentley, Williams, and La Valley. 10. The necessity for such human intervention he acknowledges in the Mahomet lecture: "a thousand thoughts, in his pilgrimings and wanderings, had been in this man: What am I? What is this unfathomable Thing I live in, which men name Universe? What is Life; what is Death? What am I to believe? What am I to do?... The great Heaven rolling silent overhead, with its blue-glancing stars, answered not.... The man's own soul, and what of God's inspiration dwelt there, had to answer!" (47). 1 1 . As Cassirer states earlier, Carlyle tried to replace the worship of God by a worship of men. The medieval form of hierarchy was changed into the modern form of 'hero- archy'" (192). And the hero makes a more-than-adequate replacement: "in no time whatever can they entirely eradicate out of living men's hearts a certain altogether peculiar reverence for Great Men... does not every true man feel that he is himself made higher by doing reverence to what is really above him?" (Heroes 13-14). 1 2. Hence, as Carlyle extenuates Luther's hatred of idolatry, "Condemnable Idolatry is [only] insincere Idolatry. Doubt has eaten out the heart of it" ( 1 05). Confronting the claim that Protestantism brought in "the era of 'private judgment,'" he asks rhetorically, "is not spiritual union, all hierarchy and subordination among men, henceforth an impossibil- ity?" But he responds, "I find Protestantism... to be the beginning of new genuine sovereignty and order. I find it to be [only] a revolt against false sovereigns" ( 1 06). Given this allegiance, the right man can become a culture hero indeed: "I liken common languid Times. . . to dry dead fuel, waiting for the lightning out of Heaven that shall kindle it. The great man, with his free force direct out of God's own hand, is the lightning" (13). 1 3. He may have refused because of piety, as he intimated; because he feared public outrage, as many have suspected; because he had already demystified Jesus through Odin, as apRoberts has claimed; or because Jesus fell short of active heroism, as Hutton and others have argued. apRoberts nicely encapsulates Carlyle's dilemma in two quotations from Sartor Resartus: Jesus remains our "divinest Symbol... a Symbol of quite perennial infinite character; whose significance will ever demand to be anew inquired into, and anew made manifest." And yet "Symbols, like all terrestrial Garments, wax old" (cited in Arnold and God 224). If institutional Christianity must be replaced as "Hebrew old clothes," must the symbol of Jesus be similarly replaced or only reinterpreted? "Fear thou that this thy great message of the Natural being the Supernatural will wholly perish unuttered" ("Ishmael" 709). 14. Brisman's argument situates Arnold firmly within the romantic tradition, it acknowledges his daring manipulation of history, and it finds continued evidence of imaginative power within his most "dated" essays. If I prefer to see this power mediated through Carlyle and the hero, it is only because Brisman's argument oversimplifies Arnold's own ambivalence. First, his Bloomian model is complicated by the presence and/or absence of Arnold's father. Since Dr. Arnold was himself an outspoken liberal with an aggressively progressive reading of theological history, Matthew's response cannot avoid being overdetermined. If he affirms the etiological claims of traditional religion, he challenges his own father; if he sides with his father, he challenges the claims of tradition. In consequence, as Cockshut argued three decades ago, Matthew "wanted to inaugurate a new religious doctrine, and to feel at the same time that he was treading the ancient paths.</page><page sequence="23">DAVID GOSLEE 43 Hence the new nineteenth century doctrine has to be ascribed to the first century" (65). Second, if Brisman's argument can overlook Arnold's longstanding suspicion of romanti- cism, it can do so only because its own vision of romanticism remains darker than any of the bleak alternatives posited by Arnold himself. For Brisman, the "interpreter may be said to be daemonized into the status of a poet-prophet" (9), but in the process history and the past are themselves being demonized into a realm "without form and void" until invested with Arnold's enlightened ideals. Third, because Brisman here buys into Arnold's project so wholeheartedly, he fails to acknowledge its reductive violence. In fact, Arnold's anachronistic readings of the Old Testament have moralized to death some of the most famous narratives in the western tradition. He even quotes with approval a French critic's dismissal of Paradise Lost because "Merely as matter of poetry, the story of the Fall has no special force or effectiveness" (8. 1 79). At bottom, however, Arnold was afraid less that such stories would fail than that they would succeed: When people "tell themselves fairy- tales. .., they pay for it. ... They are like people who have fed their minds on novels or their stomachs on opium; the reality of things is flat and insipid to them" (L&amp;D 6.379), Here religion becomes not the economic but the imaginative opiate of the masses. 15. apRoberts points out the gross anachronism of such a claim: Surely it verges on the absurd to consider the first-century apostle guilty of a sixteenth-century doctrine, and anyway the statement otherwise implies that the Calvinists read Paul aright - hardly Arnold's case!" (Arnold and God 183). Trilling's comment speaks to this issue: "while Arnold is explaining the psychological soundness of Paul's religion, the camel of theology puts its head into his tent" (347). 16. Even measured against Carlyle's criteria, Paul does not fare too badly: He is active, he is a loner, he is aggressive, he is persecuted, he succeeds against heavy odds, he is a visionary, he sees through the veil of received beliefs and opinions. What he would lack, for Carlyle and perhaps for Arnold, is originality. 17. This double movement seems to incorporate both apRoberts developmental paradigm and DeLaura's cautions that she "ignores Arnold's resistance to change and fear of the flux of history,... his search for what is lasting, enduring, even absolute... his content of culture... remains resolutely backward-looking, a museum of texts and an amalgam of carefully selected traditional values, that were to be salvaged and somehow 'applied' to the chaotic present and the fearsome future" ("apRoberts" 132-33). 18. Attacking Vernes on the law of evolution in religious progress, Arnold invokes the superiority of Jesus' code to the Athanasian creed: "Ins and outs of this kind may settle their business with the general law of evolution as they can; but our business is with the fact" ("Preface" 8.161). 19. See also his complex response to the attacks on Christianity by the mathematician Clifford: "One reads it all, half sighing, half smiling, as the declamation of a clever and confident youth.... Only when one is young and headstrong can one thus prefer bravado to experience, can one stand by the Sea of Time, and instead of listening to the solemn and rhythmical beat of its waves, choose to fill the air with one's own whoopings to start the echo" (G&amp;B 7.380-81). Though in prose, this comment could be entitled "Dover Beach Revisited." 20. While he had to appeal to the supernatural world view in which his followers were mired, he constantly worked to reinterpret it: "We have, then, to account for the firm belief of the first Christians in the physical resurrection of Jesus, when this resurrection did not actually happen.... That Jesus was a fanatic, expecting and foretelling his own physical resurrection, - deceived like his followers... - is an explanation which the whole account we have of Jesus, read seriously, shows to be idle. His disciples were misled,</page><page sequence="24">44 Religion &amp; Literature therefore, by something Jesus did actually say, which had not really the sense that he should physically rise from the dead" (G&amp;B 7.317). The dubiousness of this exegesis should not obscure the self-conscious power it attributes to Jesus himself. 21. For Schleiermacher's influence see Livingston (162-3); apRoberts, Arnold and God (66, 69); Literature and Dogma (6.268, 456n); and God and the Bible (7.293, 480n). 22. Jesus, already critic and interpreter, grows in a late essay into a poet: the words and externals of religion, Arnold argues, "are to be used as poetry.... We should seek, therefore, to use them as Jesus did. How freely Jesus himself used them, we see.... But the result has justified his way of proceeding. . . it is an aim which may well indeed be pursued with enthusiasm, to make the true meaning of Jesus, in using that poetry, emerge and prevail" ("Psychological" 8.142). 23. Arnold "was driven by a need for authority as urgent as that of Coleridge and Newman. His 'wisdom and goodness, they are God' and his 'stream of tendency by which all things fulfill the law of their being,' could not remain in complete harmony with the thought of Spinoza and Goethe. He had to go on, in his objectifying of an immanent moral principle" (Robbins 109). Arnold's powers of vision reveal curiously different futures. Like his biblical predecessors, however, he can offer conflicting predictions with equal confidence. At the end of Literature and Dogma, he feels confident that "we shall find ourselves more and more, as by irresistible viewless hands, caught and drawn towards the Christian revelation, and made to desire more and more to serve it.... We can see the process, we are ourselves part of it, and can in our measure help forward or keep back its completion" (6.401-02). Earlier in St. Paul, however, he wonders, "will the time come, as it has been foretold, when we shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and shall not see it; when the mildness and sweet reasonableness of Jesus Christ... will be clean disregarded and out of mind. Then, perhaps, will come another reaction, and another, and another; and all sterile" (6.127). Finally, in a very late essay, he incorporates both possibilities into an apocalyptic as dubious as the secular versions within Carlyle's Sartor and the French Revolution: "Jesus announced. . . a close necessitated by the emergence of the new, the decay of the old.... Sometimes we may almost be inclined to augur that from some such 'end of the age' we ourselves are not far distant now; that through dissolution, - dissolution peaceful if we have virtue enough, violent if we are vicious,... we and our own age have to pass,... the price demanded, according to the inexorable conditions on which the kingdom of God is offered" ("Comment" 10.238). 24. At the conclusion of "Pagan and Medieval Religious Sentiment," this quotation is allowed to trump both of these alternatives. 25. As late as 1885 he insists that his values are and must remain empirically grounded: "If pureness or any other virtue is still to subsist, it must subsist nowadays not by. . . enforcing it in defiance of nature, but because nature herself turns out to be really for it" ("Comment" 10.226). A few pages later, however, this natural tendency reappears in more transcendental garb: the norm of purity, "though apt to be questioned and discred- ited in the world, is at the same time nevertheless a necessary fact of nature and eternal truth of reason" (23 1). Arnold's criteria for moral evidence remain as slippery as those for scientific evidence: "People may say, they have not got this sense that their instinct to live is served by loving their neighbour;. . . but that does not make the experience the less a true thing, the real experience of the race" ("Bishop" 8.43). 26. In one of his strangest appropriations, Arnold reads the "Stirb und werdef' in Goethe's celebration of eros, "Selige Sehnsucht," as a call for moral regeneration (P&amp;P 6.55-56).</page><page sequence="25">DAVID GOSLEE 45 27. In ascribing this power to Jesus, Arnold comes close to reinstating the same doctrine of justification which he had found so abhorrently superstitious in Paul. 28. Beside this injunction, however, we have to set Arnold's subsequent warning: "we do wrong,... in labouring so much to produce in ourselves now... that conscious ardent sensation of personal love to him which we find the first generation of Christians feeling and professing... it might be well to forgo or at least suspend its use for ourselves and others for a time" (L&amp;D 6.401). In part, Arnold may fear that such love may again transformjesus into the transcendent Christ; even more, however, he may share Newman's abhorrence of evangelical sentimentality. 29. It would be wrong to imply that Arnold saw himself alone in this mission: "from time to time, through the course of ages, there have arisen men who threw themselves on the method and secret of Jesus with extraordinary force. . . theSe are they who 'received the kingdom of God as a little child,' who perceived how simple a thing Christianity was. . . the nameless author of the Imitation,... Tauler,... St. Francis of Sales, Wilson of Sodor and Man" (L&amp;D 6.350). While Arnold certainly shares their pragmatism, he also believes, I think, that he can advocate it from a far broader critical perspective. But the religious consciousness of humanity has produced in Christianity not ideas, but imagination; and it is ideas, not imaginations, which endure" (G&amp;B 7.397). 30. It is this prophetic, virulently puritanical stance which must qualify Runcie's otherwise persuasive argument (44-48) that his Christ, as a Platonic absolute, incorpo- rated both the Hebraic and the Hellenic, the ethical and the aesthetic dimensions of Arnold's thought and thus subsumed what Madden claimed (165-87) as Arnold's return to an aesthetic world view at the end of his life. Where she seeks to discover a publicly available Christology in his writing, I am interested in the more private, even unacknowl- edged religious experience which generates the otherwise inexplicable paradoxes within his theology, his ethics, and his aesthetics. In God and the Bible, Arnold had accused Sir Robert Phillimore of tying "the Church of England to a belief in the personality of Satan.... Satan and Tisiphone are alike not real persons, but shadows thrown by man's guilt and terrors" (7.384). Despite this earlier excursion into the anthropology of Feuerbach, despite the effort here to shrink Satan into conspicuous consumption, the vision of his overthrow reinscribes both sociology and anthropology within a cosmic spiritual victory attendant upon Jesus' ascent. 31. DeLaura points out that both Arnold and Carlyle asserted a shadowy providentialism, operative less and less in individual acts and lives than in some broad historical perspective" ("Religious" 1 35); yet he continues, "There is a difference: Arnold is usually not very specific in his modern examples supporting his morality of history..., whereas Carlyle is wildly elated, and soon depressed, by every revolutionary event up to at least 1848" (143). In Arnold's late "Comment on Christmas," however, the advent of social legislation prompts his intimation that "the idea of the common good is acquiring amongst us, at the present day, a force altogether new" (10.237). And in preferring this good we are implicitly preferring "the interest of 'the body of Christ,' - to use the Gospel phrase" (236). 32. Within God and the Bible, he seems to return to Feuerbach: "as God is said to have made man in his own image, the image of God, man has returned the compliment and has made God as being, outwardly or inwardly, in the image of man" (7. 162) and "'the Eternal Power' to bridge the gap between a Spinozism they intellectually could not surrender and a deepening of the religious consciousness (especially in Arnold) they saw as emotionally</page><page sequence="26">46 Religion &amp; Literature necessary" ("Religious" 141). As we have seen, however, Arnold's troubles arise when he tries to fuse Spinozist rationalism with Humean empiricism. 33. John Waller is careful to distinguish Thomas Arnold's liberalism from that of his son. Dr. Arnold insisted on both the historicity of the resurrection and the personality of God (66-70). DeLaura, as we saw, attributed Arnold's late conception of God to "a Spinozism [he] intellectually could not surrender" ("Religious" 141), but this simply moves the issue of motivation back two decades; we still need to ask why Matthew found Spinoza's version of God so attractive in the first place. 34. As DeLaura notes ("Religious" 135), Arnold remains uniformly critical of all liberal schemes to set up humanistic religions. As he said, "Religious life resides not in an incessant movement of ideas, but in a feeling which attaches itself to certain fixed objects" ("Stanley" 3.67). 35. Super comments, "The authorship of the work (first issued in 1418) was still much in dispute in Arnold's day" (6.493n). Also a favorite of George Eliot, the Imitation figures prominently in Mill on the Floss. "The feeling and disposition of the individual himself. ... It is the essence of Christianity, it is what the Jews needed, it is the line in which their religion was ripe for development" (L&amp;D 6.217). Despite the tactless linearity of Arnold's para- digm, its inward turn threatens to escape history, perhaps even to render historical development a contradiction in terms. See DeLaura's caution about apRoberts' equation of Arnold's religion and Bildung. "the inwardness' of Arnold's religious ideal lies at a distinct remove from the naively imperious personal assertion and intellectualism of so much in her German tradition" ("apRoberts" 1 36). 36. While this passage dramatizes beautifully Arnold's powerful, positive appeal to what DeLaura calls his "agnosticism," his efforts elsewhere to calculate the "incalculable" prompt misgivings even from the modern critic who most values his norms for worship. Dorothea Krook can affirm that "Arnold's is one of the great prophetic voices of the last age, his book a prophetic book, and his constructive critique of the religious tradition from which the true Humanism is to emerge an example, and inspiration, and a hope" (255). At the same time, however, she must acknowledge that humanist worship "would no more be the same as the Christian's experience of worship than Arnold's conception of prayer is the same as the Christian's; and [here] Arnold... appears to have minimized the difficul- ties of substituting an eternal-not-ourselves-which-makes-for-righteousness for the Per- sonal God of historic Christianity" (258). 37. Another passage affirms even less equivocally these intimations of divine aid: though "every other attachment may fail us; this alone fails not" (L&amp;D 6.205). In light of Arnold's quasi-empirical, quasi-Spinozist rejection of special providences, such affirmations become all the more anomalous. WORKS CITED apRoberts, Ruth.
