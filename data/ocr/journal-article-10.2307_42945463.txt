<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philippe Hamon Text and Ideology: For a Poetics of the Norm The notion of ideology, as it is developed by the various sociologies of literature, tends too often to be restricted to the selection of works (texts or messages which are political, realistic, and so forth), and offers poetics only a summary set of tools, a minimal number of practical concepts, some of which are disparate, some very general, and a framework which ultimately is not clearly defined ("everything is ideology") for the analysis and the theory of the relationship between the ideological and the textual. And in this binomial the term "text" seems, at present, to be defined more satisfactorily and homogene- ously, less "massively," than the term "ideology." In order to remain within the boundaries of cautious generalities and to conserve a truly semiotic or poetic point of view regarding the phenomena in question, the first decisions - precautions - would undoubtedly be as follows: (1) not to study so much the ideology "of the" text (in its "relationship" to the text) as the "ideological effect" of the text as a relationship inscribed in the text and constructed by it. We thus restate the problem in textual terms, and maintain a certain priority (which is not primacy) of a textual point of view; (2) to take into account at the same time the paradigmatic dimension of the ideological effect (ideology distributes markers and stable differentiating values which form a system-it constitutes and ratifies hierarchical lists and axiologies) and its syntagmatic or "praxeological" (Piaget) dimension (ideol- ogy is production and dynamic manipulation of programs and means) oriented towards ends, integrating, soliciting, and constituting actants engaged in "contracts" or in narrative "syntaxes" of sanctioned acts;1 (3) not to restrict the analysis of the relationship of text(s)-ideology(ies) to the analysis of works and genres already circumscribed beforehand by their referents, themes, specifications, publics, and historical moments (realistic- figurative discourses, political or polemical discourses); (4) not to restrict the analysis to the implementing of a method, be it historical or sociological, statistical or distributional, polarized on the study of the frequency of use of key words in their contextual environments; (5) not to restrict the analysis to the study of a single, very particular level of textual organization, the lexical level (vocabulary) for example, too often considered the most important and only pertinent level since it is the only one accessible to quantitative manipulations and the only carrier of STYLE: Vol. 17, No. 2, Spring 1983</page><page sequence="2">96 Philippe Hamon meaning in the utterance; or not to privilege the enunciation ( ënonciation ), conceived a priori to be more important than the utterance; or not to restrict the analysis to such and such an effect of a particular meaning of the utterances (énoncés): ideology intervenes as well in the differential semantic definition of the actants of the utterance, as in the knowledge that they have of things, their programs of manipulation and reciprocal persuasion, or the evaluations that they make of narrative states or programs. The analysis, thus, might be recentered on a semiotics of knowing (strategies of manipulation, of evaluation, of the fixing of contracts, of persuasion and belief, of knowledge and misinformation, and so forth), integrated in a general theory of modali- ties.2 Let me digress here to note the particularly insistent recurrence of a concept which seems to function as a key idea in the theoretical discourse on the relationship' between text and ideology, the concept of "absence." To signify, we are all aware, is to exclude, and vice versa. Every production of meaning is exclusion, selection, difference, opposition; every mark is a separation, and inversely, every figure is presence and absence, every supposi- tion entails presuppositions. The linguist, the psychoanalyst, the anthropolo- gist, the rhetorician, the poetician, and the sociologist seem to be in total agreement about this. To the postulate, "the whole text (the whole of the text) is ideology," the sociologist seems at present to prefer the symmetrical postulate: "it is absence which is (which signals) ideology." And it is this very concept of absence (lacuna, degree zero, hole, ellipsis, the unsaid, the implicit, the blank) which seems promoted to the rank of fundamental concept, pluridisciplinary and ecumenical par excellence , explicatory master key for all analysis and methodological universal for all metalanguages, opening all textual locks. We provide a few quotations, selected almost at random: To read with Freuďs eyes is to read, in a literary work as the activity of a human being and as a result of this activity, what the work says without revealing it for want of knowing it ; to read what the work silences through what it shows. ^ The sociocritic questions the implicit, the presuppositions, the unsaid or the unthought, the silences, and formulates the hypothesis of the social unconscious of the text.4 To know a literary work . . . would be to tell what it says without saying it. In fact, a real analysis . . . must encounter a never spoken, an initial silence. ... It aims at . . . the work's absence which is behind every work, and constitutes it. If the term "structure" has a meaning, it does so to the extent that it designates this absence. . . . The work exists above all by its determined absences, by what it doesn't say, in relation to what is not the work. . . . It is against the background of the ideology, the original and tacit language, that the work is formed. . . . The distance which separates the work from the ideology which it transforms can be found in the very words which make up the work:the work separates ideology from itself, undoing it at the same time that it creates it. A new type of necessity can be defined: by absence, by lack.^ In constituting the table of the story's variants, there would be, of course, in places, some blank spaces. All the mathematically possible forms have not been produced."</page><page sequence="3">Text and Ideology 97 Mythical syntax is not ever entirely free within the single limit of its rules. . . . Among all the theoretically possible operations when one sees them only from a formal standpoint, certain of these operations are eliminated summarily, and these blanks - seemingly cut out of a whole which would otherwise have been uniform - trace negatively the contours of a structure within a structure, and which it is necessary to integrate into the other in order to obtain the real system of operations.7 Such is the art of the trap: banality. Such must be ... the art of frustrating this art: to locate the strange in the banal. I mean to locate on the continuous surface the minuscule hole in which, without noticing it, I the reader am going to fall, the trap being that I fall without knowing I'm falling, that I tumble into the hole while all the while continuing to walk on the surface, that I am taken - prisoner - in the pit of a meaning while continuing to read, to produce meanings, continuously.^ These "absences" are all, we might suppose, particular absences, defined within a certain type of relationship and within a particular framework; absences defined against the background of existence, or of presence, in relation to a truth or a reality, in relation to a given, a construed, a reconstructed, or something foreseen or correlated. But the multiple meanings and methodological status of this concept seem to interfere rapidly with the work of a number of researchers in every approach to the text-ideology relationship, and often in a heteroclite and not always compatible way; we can rapidly reclass the principal acceptations of these "absences," which are often not very clearly distinguished from each other: (1) The absence is that of an observation that should have permitted the recording of a constructed combinatory abstract system; this absence is thus localized as such in relation to the generative capacity of a theoretical model a priori. Thus, for example, in the case of the fantastic, the absence of a certain variable, or unity, or possible combination of unities (made possible by the canonical model of the story) and not observed by the analyst in his corpus. This is the meaning of the quotations from Propp and Lévi-Strauss that we have given above.9 Ideology and its filtering work can thus be perceived in the gap which exists between a constructed model which acts as a norm and a given. This relationship of a possible and observable, of a permitted (by the theory) and an absence, is thus a relation which is doubly problematic, to the extent that the analyst will never know if the lacuna thus circumscribed proceeds from a defect of the model (not "strong" enough) or from a (temporary) lacuna in the collected documentation. Moreover, rare are the analysts who always take care to specify the exact nature of their model (structural? statistical? generative?). (2) The absence can be defined in relation to a logical, rhetorical, or stylistic model constructed by the text, posed, exploited, and brought into play in and by the text, incorporated in and partially eluded by the text; absence is here ellipsis, programmed by the text and filled in by the reader, who collaborates in the completion of the model. This is the imprinted presence of something implicit whose place is designated. It is also the imprinted presence</page><page sequence="4">98 Philippe Hamon of the reader, who is installed in a specific place in the text and solicited as an active partner in the communication process. Thus, for example, the absence of one of the terms or one of the positions (A, B, C or D) of an analogy (A:B::C:D; A is to B what C is to D, a system of hierarchical relations such as it is defined, for example, by Aristotle in Chapter 21 of his Poetics)-, or, to take another example, the absence of one of the terms of a syllogism, which thus becomes an enthymeme, whose missing third term is supplied by the reader. Absence is here absence in relation to an in praesentia model, perturbation of a canvas and of a horizon of expectation developed by the text. But nothing says, a priori, that the absence of a term or a position in a textual structure is the surfacing of the work of manipulation or censure, that this or that abridged figure of the analogy, as, for example, a metaphor (for example, "the toad, nightingale of the mud" - Tristan Corbière) is less, or more, or otherwise "ideological" than its form expanded to four terms (of the type: "the toad is to mud what the nightingale is to the tree"); the rhythmic reasons for construc- tion of a stylistic object (acceleration and reduction of speed, condensation and expansion) must not be confused with ideological reasons for obliteration of something to be censored. (3) Absence can be absence in relation to an element or to an event outside of the text, in relation to verifiable historical or biographical "reality," that is to say, in relation to an already written and inscribed "knowledge." For example, such as a story by Maupassant, whose action takes place during the Paris Commune in 1871 does not mention the Commune. Or a text by an author who had just lost someone dear to him, or had just experienced a serious professional failure, and who did not mention it. Besides the fact that this absence can be imposed by the specifications of some rhetorical pact, by the previous choice of a literary genre (each literary genre prescribes or proscribes some mode of indexation of the real), it is always difficult to locate, to count, to classify, and above all to interpret the absences of the "realia" of the work, the gaps between structure and conjuncture. In addition, it will sometimes be difficult to make a detour by way of the contemporary history of the text in the case of texts historically and geographically delocalized and devoid of accompanying archival material (humorous stories, nursery rhymes, stories with several variations, ancient texts, and so on). Moreover, it will be equally difficult, undoubtedly, to distinguish in certain texts the difference of status and function which can exist between the explicit notion of absence ("X was missing from Y"; "Y was not there"; "Y doesn't exist"; "I will not speak of Y" - see the innumerable variants of pretermission),10 the implicit absence of notation (such as a realistic description of a city which does not mention the existence of a certain monument), and the explicit notation of a non-absence ("X was not missing from Y"), and to recognize the difference which might exist between censure (in essence that which "suppresses" or "whites out" a certain part of the text) brought about by the real, by the text itself, by the</page><page sequence="5">Text and Ideology 99 author, or by the reader. The unsaid of the text is not necessarily the result of a consciously or unconsciously observed interdiction; every cut is not necessar- ily the result of censorship, every suppression that of pressure. The extreme refinement of the batteries of rhetorical rules which codify the insertion and manipulation of "absences" in a text (irony, ellipsis, euphemism, litotes, periphrasis, reticence, pretermission, digression, and so forth) shows that absence is, often, an effect like another, a process constructed as much as submitted to, that is as much a result of mastery as of mistake. And the hole in the text does not necessarily reflect the real, is not necessarily the absent real; it can be the real itself which, by its presence, makes a hole in the homogeneity of the fiction. Zola, who often considered the problem of the grafting of the real in the textual, understood this very well.11 (4) Absence can be seen in the intertextual play of an interval, in the comparison of an original text with its rewriting. Thus, between this sentence from Zola's Germinal - "Fires would break out, not a stone of the cities would be left standing, there would be a return to savage life in the woods, after the great rut, the great revelry, when the poor, in one night would violate [efflanqueraient] the wives of the rich and empty their wine cellars" - and its rewriting in a school anthology: "Fires would break out, not a stone of the cities would be left standing, there would be a return to savage life in the woods, after the great revelry, when the poor, in one night, would empty the wine cellars of the rich."12 The absence of two phrases can be observed: "after the great rut" and "would violate the wives of the rich." This absence only has meaning, of course, in the act of knowledgeable reading which is itself the tributary of the system in which the text is finished, fixed, protected, and the private property of an author. Interpreted here as "censure," an absence of this type will be interpreted as a "variant" in the system of the popular oral story. Whatever the discourse held on the problem and the finalities of the analysis of the text-ideology relationship, the analyst, most of the time, gives little information about the modalities of localization of these famous absences (how did he find them?), their status (acceptance of 1, 2, 3 or 4, among the four types that we have just seen), their origin , and their function . Certainly, we can agree on the fact that the degree of vulnerability of an ideology is undoubtedly (somewhere, in some fashion) inversely proportional to the explication of its postulates, of its means, of its tactics and ends, and that power (like capital in Zola's Germinal , represented in the novel as an anonymous and invisible god crouching in the depths of unknown tabernacles) is stranger since it is hidden and that it tends to erase in its utterances the sources and very marks of its enunciation. But this agreement on principle does not found any specific protocol for the analysis of texts. It is certainly not a question of underestimating the heuristic and stimulating power of this concept of absence. But its metalinguistic status remains at the same time unclear, and it is not always easy to manipulate it</page><page sequence="6">100 Philippe Hamon within the confines of a homogenous theory. On the other hand, one can see the benefits of its use, and for what (triple) profit it can be put into circulation: first, to reconfirm and reaffirm the sagacity and the prestige of the interpreter- describer-analyst (the critic, hermeneut of absent, dead, purloined, dissemi- nated letters - see the problem of anagrams - of the text), who was able to locate the silences and note the absences, whose intelligence is thus propor- tional to the number of lacunae disclosed and implicits reestablished; second, to reconfirm the myth of the "depth" of texts, cryptogram-texts split into hierarchical significations. Thus the two prestigious terms of the interpreter- interpreted couple are justified by mutual reaffirmation; through absence the presence of literature as difference is once again institutionalized. Does not theory, here, only give its allegiance, through mimesis, to a certain literature (let us say of the Mallarmé-Blanchot type), which has made the concept of absence into the flag of a certain modernity, literature which undoubtedly had as its origin this realist-naturalist dream of the "book about nothing"?13 In addition, thirdly, to reactivate the indefatigable and convenient notion of the norm and the gap, so practical for thinking anything. It is to be feared, it is evident, that such a concept as absence, used as a catch-all, will incite the promotion of any and all substitution operations in the analysis of texts and of their modes of production and consumption, that the gap will call for the uncontrollable stopgap, the cutting tool, the cutout, the deflation of the text, the inflation of prosthesis and paraphrase. Beauzée wrote in the article entitled "Supplément" in the Encyclopédie. "The more one is convinced of the reality of the Ellipsis, of the nature of the relations whose signs subsist still in the words that the ordinary sentence preserves, the more one must admit the necessity of the Supplement in order to get to the core of the meaning of the elliptic sentence." The problem becomes, then, to construct a theory of this "supplement," to move from a "reality of the ellipsis" to a theory of the Ellipsis as a sign of a real which is to be supplemented.14 As ecumenical concepts go, value (see its uses in the work of Saussure and the structural linguists, as well as that of economists, anthropologists, or in aesthetics) seems, everything considered, preferable to absence. 15 Let us put in abeyance these problems - important though they are - in order to return to the point of view which interests us here. Let us begin with a hypothesis: that the ideological effect of a text (and not the ideology) passes through the construction and stylistic production of normative systems of the text which are incorporated into the utterance. Their modes of construction, frequency of appearance, and density vary certainly in utterances according to diverse but observable socio-linguistic constraints.16 In addition, these norma- tive-evaluative systems can undoubtedly be distributed in an aleatory manner in texts, as the evaluation (in utterance) affects the very conditions of the enunciation (the degrees, the supports, or the modes of competence and of success in the evaluation of the enunciation of the narrator, and the modes of</page><page sequence="7">Text and Ideology 101 justification of the very fact of emitting an utterance), or as it affects the various phases, characters, or supports of the processes of the utterance. One can nevertheless suggest, as a refined hypothesis, that these evaluative systems can appear and be localized in particular privileged textual points, and that the general theory of points can be developed independently of the types of works manipulated: neuralgic points, deontic points, points which function as intersections or normative focal points of the text. There are two principal consequential problems: the structure of these normative focal points and their preferential modes of surfacing and of manifestation. These points can be defined as points of evaluation, or as "modaliza- tions," that is to say, as complex relational focal points. According to Benveniste, "we mean by modality a complementary assertion affecting the utterance of a relation."17 This is shown in Figure 1. The evaluation of "complementary assertion" is an act of relating the relation (Rl) that is the comparison that an actor or a narrator or any other evaluating instance in an utterance establishes between an (evaluated) process and a norm (evaluating, prohibitory, or prescriptive program, at once referent and term of the evaluation); this norm, functioning as a program and ideal model endowed with a stable value, is itself a relation - an ideal, virtual, or actualized simulation of a relation (R2) between at least two actants A'l and A'2; finally, the evaluated process is itself a relation (R3) between (at least) two actants (Al Evaluating Norm / * ' R2 A'l ! A'2 Evaluation Al ¿3 A2 s Evaluated Process Figure 1.</page><page sequence="8">102 Philippe Hamon and A2, singular or plural, real or virtual, anthropomorphic or non-anthropo- morphic, and so forth); the ideological point of a text can thus be considered as a surfacing point for this complex relational system, as the evaluation of a relation, that is, as "parallel" (and we know, since antiquity, the privileged ties of this rhetorical form with ethics and evaluative discourse in general), as the relating and conjoining (Rl) of two relations (R2 and R3). An example, taken from Perrault, in the first "Morality" of Maitre chat, ou le chat bottë ( Puss in Boots), in which the narrator evaluates the acquisition of goods by ruse and ability (innate or acquired qualities) in relation and comparison to the acquisition of riches through inheritance (legal means): ( 1 ) L'industrie et le savoir-faire Valent mieux que des biens acquis. Industry and know-how Are worth more than acquired goods. 1 ® Or, in other words, the ideological point is to be considered as the intrusion or surfacing in a text of knowledge, of a normative competence of the narrator (or of an evaluating character) distributing at this intersection positivities or negativities, successes or failures, conformities or deviances, excesses or lacks, dominants or hierarchical subordinations, something as acceptable or unac- ceptable, suitable or unsuitable, and so forth. We provide some examples taken from Maupassant's short story "Deux Amis" ("Two Friends") (we underline the principal expressions of the evaluative discourse):19 (2) Cela vaut mieux que le boulevard, hein? This is better than the boulevard, don't you think? (3) Ils se remirent à marcher sur le boulevard . . . rêveurs et tristes ... : "Et la pêche? Hein! Quel bon souvenir!" They continued their walk on the boulevard . . . dreamy and sad . . . "And going fishing? Eh! What a good memory!" (4) D'instant en instant ils levaient leurs lignes avec une petite bête argentée frétillant au bout du fil: une vraie pêche miraculeuse. From one moment to the next they were bringing in their lines with a little silver creature wriggling on the end; a truly miraculous catch. (5) L'officier . . . une sorte de géant velu. . . leur demanda, en excellent français: "Eh bien, Messieurs, avez-vous fait bonne pêche?" The officer ... a sort of hairy giant . . . asked them, in excellent French: " Well , sirs, has your fishing been good} " In examples 2 and 3, two characters in the narrative, Morissot and Sauvage (and the narrator, in example 3: "sad"), evaluate the states and processes which concern them, that is to say, compare, their actual situation (fishing) with their disjunct situation (life in the city, the boulevard), or their</page><page sequence="9">Text and Ideology 103 present situation (the boulevard where they are walking, their stomach empty, in a Paris encircled by the enemy, that is, their disjunct relation to food and liberty) to their past situation (angling and a full stomach, conjunction with food and liberty); this comparison takes the form, in both cases, of the correlating of a present program with a non-actualized program disjoined in time and space, each of these programs being the relation (conjunctive or disjunctive) of a subject with an object endowed with a value, positive or negative, fishing functioning, in both cases, as a "program-norm" endowed with a positive value, contrary to the boulevard, to the war, and to their programs. In example 4, the narrator evaluates the characters' performance positively, that is, evaluates the relation of the characters to tools, to a technique, and to an end (fishing), an evaluation which is here made at the same time in relation to an intertextual norm (the miraculous catch). In example 5, the narrator evaluates ("excellent") the competence and linguistic performance of a character (his relationship to others through speech): that is to say, he compares this performance to an implicit norm ("good" French, "correct" French). In this same example, the narrator evaluates as well the aesthetic aspect ("hairy giant") of a character (Prussian officer), a character whose officer's rank places him as well in a hierarchy and who becomes in addition an evaluator himself, proposing an evaluation ("good catch") in the form of a question, that is, proposing a comparison of the real performance of the two friends with a virtual technical norm ("good fishing"). The notions of "norm," of "value," of actantial "relation" implying at least a "subject," and of "mediation" (the tools and the language, for example, function as mediators between subjects and between subjects and objects) are thus indispensable and necessary elements for constructing these "normative focal points" of the text; these elements all imply the others: there is evaluation and norm only where there is an evaluating subject in a mediated relationship with another actant. Let us emphasize that these notions have the advantage of belonging to a homogenous semiotic metalanguage, of being manipulable in the terms of and within a strictly textual framework. A normative evaluation in a text can assume forms and thematic investments which are a priori diverse and multiple and can have localiza- tions which are a priori diverse as well. At first glance anything can, in an utterance, be the object of an evaluation, can be invested with a positive or negative value, can become the term of a comparison, and can become subject to prescription or proscription. Four privileged relations seem, however, a posteriori, to be retainable. They are those which produce mediated relations between subjects and objects and between subjects and subjects (there is, let us repeat, value where there is norm, and there is norm where there is a mediated relation between actants): that is, relations which consist in manipulation of "tools" (the tool is a mediation between an individual subject and an object or useful material), in manipulation of linguistic "signs" (language is a mediator</page><page sequence="10">104 Philippe Hamon between an individual subject and another individual or plural subject), in manipulation of "laws" (the law is a mediator between the individual subject and collective subjects), and in manipulation of aesthetic "canons" (the aesthetic grill is a mediator between an individual sensorial subject and collections of subjects or objects which are non-utilitarian). This notion of mediation implies thus not only a relation between actants, but a "discrete" (cut into differentiated units) analysis of this relation. We will return to this later. The object relation and the point of application of the evaluation will thus tend to appear in the text as the semiotic actanťs ability to do, say, live, and enjoy, and the privileged points of surfacing of the ideological effect will be defined in the text as points of discourse, points of (technical) focusing, points of view, and points of honor, these neuralgic or deontic points of the text eventually being able (this is the syntagmatic or "praxeologic" dimension of the effect) to unfold and be articulated in lines of discourse, lines of action, lines of sight, and lines of conduct. In fact, each time that a character, for example, opens his mouth to read or say something (see example 5: "The officer . . . asked them in excellent French"), an evaluative accompanying discourse ("excellent") may appraise his speech, according to grammatical norms (correct/incorrect, readable/ unreadable, grammatical/non-grammatical, comprehensible/incomprehensi- ble), this accompanying discourse being assumed (it thus belongs to a superior competence) either by a narrator or by a character of the utterance. We provide some examples: (6) M. Homais parlait arôme, ozmazône, suc et gélatine d'une façon à éblouir. M. Homais was quite dazzling on the subject of aromas, osmazones, juices and gelatines.

He was often at a loss for words, he had to twist his sentence, he would manage finally with an effort accompanied by a thrust of his shoulder. But as a result of this constant strain, he would encounter images of familiar energy which seized his audience.

Here are some examples: (11) Il y avait Ned Land, le roi des harponneurs. Ned Land était un Canadien, d'une habileté de main peu commune, et qui ne connaissait pas d'égal dans son périlleux métier . . . ; il fallait être une baleine bien maligne, ou un cachalot singulièrement astucieux pour échapper à son coup de harpon.

For his eyes, the world acts as a spectacle (beautiful/ugly, pleasant/ disagreeable, sublime/without interest, admirable/detestable); for his ears, it is music (euphoric/cacophonic);for his sense of taste, it is cuisine (good/bad, flavorful/ dull); for his sense of touch, an object (smooth/rough, pleasant/ unpleasant); for his nose, a smell (pleasant/unpleasant, sweet/foul, and so forth); among these aesthetic grilles, those which direct sight are undoubtedly privileged, reticulating the world into lines of sight and organized spectacles (the templům of contemplatore). Some examples are ( 1 6) La demoiselle du comptoir . . . , grande Franc-Comtoise, fort bien faite, et mise comme il faut pour faire valoir un café . . ., se pencha . . ce qui lui donna l'occasion de déployer une taille superbe.

Proust, La Prisonnière (The Captive) Finally, each time that a character acts in a collectivity, his relation to others can be regulated by rules of etiquette, laws, a civil code, hierarchies, precedences, alimentary taboos, table manners, rules of courtesy (appropriate/</page><page sequence="13">Text and Ideology 107 inappropriate, correct/incorrect, private/public, distinguished/vulgar, guilty/ innocent, and so forth) which, assumed by this or that character, have a discriminating effect on his actions and his ability to act in society, on his knowledge of the world. We provide some examples: (20) Elle remplissait ses devoirs de maîtresse de maison avec un sourire machinal. She fulfilled her duties as a housewife with a mechanical smile.

The ecclesiastic declined very politely. . . . The pharmacist . . . found his conduct very improper. . . . This refusal to accept a refreshment seemed to him a most odious hypocrisy. Flaubert, Madame Bovary The four normative systems recorded above, and distinguished for pedagogical reasons, can be presented in varied and diversified forms, thematic contents, and points of the text. None is incompatible with the others, each text tending, more or less, to interweave these systems and make them collaborate perpetually, and to construct its own predominating norm. They can, finally, be concentrated in the same point of the text, or overdetermine each other, or be concentrated so that they neutralize each other. Several processes of variation can thus come into play, separately or simultaneously, affecting (1) the form of the evaluation, which can be positive (conformity to a model) or negative (non-conformity to the model), prescrip- tive or permissive (tolerant or neutral); (2) the evaluation point to which the norm is related, which can be related to a state, to a character's action, to the state previous to an action, or to the state resulting from the action; (3) the origin of evaluations which can be diversified (several evaluating characters, narrators and/or actors) or monopolized (one narrator, a single evaluating character), suggesting that the degree of redundancy or of reduction of the evaluation can thus vary, since evaluators, the evaluated, and the norm can be</page><page sequence="14">108 Philippe Hamon distinct actors, or they can accumulate syncretically on the same character (as in the case of a character who evaluates himself); (4) the number of norms called together at the same point of the text (and thus their eventual agreement or disagreement). We will here take up rapidly, using several examples, only summary aspects of the problems which the development, to follow, of this typology of predominating textual normatives poses. These problems can include normative overdetermination and syncretism, when, for example, a technical act is also an act of language , and a judicial act (privileged textual points: performatives); internormative polarization, when several similar or contradictory norms are brought simultaneously together on the same object of evaluation (such as when a picture "carefully" painted - technical norm - is at the same time "beautiful" - aesthetic norm - and represents a suitable subject - ethical norm); and intranormative reduction, when evaluations (similar or contradictory) depending on a single norm (technological, linguis- tic, ethical, or aesthetic) are distributed on the differentiated points of the same textual syntagm (for example, a narrative syntagm). The point of application of an evaluation can relate as well to "states" (the conjunction or the disjunction of an actant-subject with another actant) such as states of "characters" or states of "things," states which precede a transformation or an action (it is thus an eventual ability to, or becoming able to, act which is evaluated) or states consecutive to an action or transformation (results are evaluated), as well as to "transformations." If the point of application relates to transformations, the performances themselves of the actants are being evaluated, in terms of the conformity or non-conformity of their development to that of an ideal program-norm which acts as a model. The evaluation can apply, too, to the relation between states and perfor- mances. For instance, in example 1 1 from Jules Verne, to define Ned Land as "king of the harpooners . . . with uncommon dexterity" is an evaluation which concerns a skill and already acquired technical qualities, a state which, depending on whether its place in the novel is inaugural or terminal (here inaugural), can be considered as an evaluation which allows us to assume a satisfactory subsequent performance (it is thus a horizon of technical expecta- tion) or as an evaluation of a state resulting from repeated previous perfor- mances (an "experience"). The norm, here, not only refers us to an exterior model, but possesses, as well, an anaphoric intratextual function (the "coher- ence" of a character effect and, beyond that, of the text). On the other hand, as in the following examples, the evaluation can concern the whole and the globality of a sequence, the technical act itself, evaluated thus in its development according to a double criterion: conformity of the result obtained to the anterior project (the technical act does not "fail") on the one hand and conformity of the whole of the technical act to the ideal global norm, more or less implicit, on the other:</page><page sequence="15">Text and Ideology 109 (25) C'en était fait du capitaine si, prompt comme la pensée, son harpon à la main, Ned Land, se précipitant vers le requin, ne l'eût frappé de sa terrible pointe. Les flots s'imprégnèrent d'une masse de sang. . . . Ned Land n'avait pas manqué son but. C'était le râle du monstre. It would have been all over for the captain if, as quick as lightning, his harpoon in his hand, Ned Land, rushing headlong towards the shark, hadn't struck it with the terrible point. The waves turned deep red. . . . Ned Land had not missed his target. It was the death rattle of the monster. Verne, 20 000 lieues sous les mers (Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea) (26) Dick Sand . . . donna des preuves de sa merveilleuse adresse au fusil ou au pistolet en abattant quelques-uns de ces rapides volatiles. Dick Sand . . . gave proof of his marvelous skill with the rifle and pistol by killing some of the rapid birds. Verne, Un capitaine de quinze ans (The Boy Captain) Let us emphasize, in these two examples, the words "proof' and "target." An argumentative scheme, at once articulated and oriented, is at work here, comparing the disjunct and differentiated moments of a technical program, the competence and the performance, the positive of the one serving as (retrospective) "proof' or as horizon of expectation (prospective) to that of the other. The evaluation which "opens" and connects the text to the normative behind-the-text plays thus as well the role of an operator of readability by correlating the differentiated narrative points of the same text. So, if one "unfolds" the normative "point" into the corresponding normative "line" (the point of honor unfolds into the line of conduct, the point of view into the line of sight, the technical development into the production line, the grammar point into the line of discourse), we see that the positive or negative sign can be displaced, can be applied to differentiated points of these lines, can thus become a founding element of narrative coherence. Or, eventually, it can become an element of a discordance or of an incoherence, if the text decides to play the positivity of a competence against the negativity of a performance and of a result, or inversely, if the text plays the negativity of a project against the positivity of a performance and a result (X is incompetent and he succeeds, X is competent but he fails, X is incompetent and he fails, X is incompetent but he succeeds, X is competent and he acts competently but he fails, X is incompetent and he acts incompe- tently but he succeeds, and so forth). Thus, in L'Oeuvre ( The Masterpiece) by Zola, appears the following evaluation by an art critic of a painting on exhibit in the Salon, a painting done by a "former veterinarian" and representing horses: (27) C'est plein de qualités, ça! Il connaît joliment son cheval, le bonhomme! Sans doute, il peint comme un salaud!</page><page sequence="16">1 10 Philippe Hamon That's full of good qualities! The old man really knows his horses! Undoubtedly, he paints like a swine! Likewise, in example 1 5 above, Bouvard and Pécuchet fail (the failure [échec] is programmed and anagrammed in the very name of one of the heroes) in spite of all the "care" given to the technical implementation of the gardening. The textual production of such evaluative concordances which play upon the syntagmatic of the text (the consequence is consistent with the prior project, the subsequent with the antecedent, the performance with the competence), or discordances (the result is not consistent with the project or does not correspond to its implementation: failures, setbacks, technical bungling, unconvincing persuasive discourses, and so forth) are certainly favored by the fact of the "discrete" and linear side of the mediated programs which give rise to evaluation. This evaluation, which introduces "distinc- tions," bears on an already "articulated" relation, on a mediation which is itself (sign, tool, law, aesthetic canon) "analysis" of the real; lines of sight, lines of conduct, lines of discourse and technological programs are, in effect, discrete modes of organization of time and of space: division of work time into schedules, scenarios, seriated praxemes, and of work space into differenti- ated "posts" (the working "production line" more or less "in atoms"); division of the articulated line of oral or written discourse into periods, dialogues, phrases, words, morphemes, pages, chapters, figures, and of the space of communication into differentiated posts, postures, and pacts; division of the time of life in society into legally concatenated moments and of the social space into zones, territories (see Goffman: The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life) and into differentiated classes; division of aesthetic space into lines of sight, perspective reticulations, forms and contents, sites, "templa" and contemplation tables, genres and differentiated literary and artistic categories,20 and of the aesthetic time into rhythms, historical schools, cadences, moments which are equally differentiated. So, in the interior of a single line thus "articulated," there is the possibility of a montage and of a normative combining, the possibility of playing one moment of the discourse against another, one class against another, one post against another, one act of a "line" against another disjunct act of the same line, or of another line coming from another normative system. Overdetermination and normative syncretism (an evaluation on one mediation level is at the same time an evaluation on another mediation level), internormative polarization (several differentiated norms are concentrated in a single textual point), and intranormative reduction (a single norm is distributed, contradictorily or not, on differentiated points of the text) very often go together. The process of internormative polarization, which tends to concentrate and to convoke simultaneously in a single textual point (a character's state or action) several different normative systems, which can</page><page sequence="17">Text and Ideology 1 1 1 eventually be concordant (negatively or positively) or discordant, and can be delegated to textual authorities (narrators and/or differentiated characters), very often serves as an "alarm signal," a stylistic intensifier, to emphasize this intrusion of ideology into the text, and to signal to the reader an important "normative focal point" of the text. Thus, to recapitulate, in its most developed textual form, example 5 from Maupassant: Une sorte de géant velu, qui fumait, à cheval sur une chaise, une grande pipe de porcelaine, leur demanda, en excellent français: "Eh bien, Messieurs. . . ." A sort of hairy giant who was smoking, while straddling a chair, a big porcelain pipe, asked them, in excellent French: "Well, gentlemen. . . ." We can record, concentrated on a single character, an aesthetic norm presenting negativity ("hairy giant"), a technological norm posing a negativity ("straddling a chair": improper use of a technical object), a linguistic norm posing a positivity ("excellent French") and an ethical norm (code of good manners: "appropriate" address, "gentlemen") posing a positivity. A "norma- tive intersection," a normative polyphony, is then constructed and posed by the text, which thus proposes to the reader, at the same time and in a single textual place, a problematic horizon of expectation: will the character thus presented be, afterwards, rather positive or rather negative? We here find again the important role of the normative in a text in order to construct or deconstruct the coherence and the endogenous readability of a narrative, thus to assure and to exploit intratextually the interest of the story, independently of the (real) modes of extratextual anchoring of this same normative in exterior history. Zola uses the same technique, in Germinal, to present the crowd of miners on strike: (28) Les yeux brûlaient, on voyait seulement les trous des bouches noires, chantant la Marseillaise , dont les strophes se perdaient dans un mugissement confus, accompagné par le claquement des sabots sur la terre dure. . . . "Quels visages atroces!" balbutia Mme Hennebeau. . . . Négrel dit entre ses dents: "Le diable m'emporte si j'en reconnais un seul! D'où sortent-ils donc, ces bandits-là?" .... La colère, la faim, ces deux mois de souffrance et cette débandade enragée au travers des fosses, avaient allongé en mâchoires de bêtes fauves les faces placides des houilleurs de Montsou. . . . Alors, la route sembla charrier du sang. . . . "Oh! Superbe!" dirent à demi-voix Lucie et Jeanne remuées dans leur goût d'artistes par cette belle horreur. Their eyes were burning, one could only see the black holes of their mouths, singing the Marseillaise , whose stanzas were lost in a confused howling, accompanied by the clacking of wooden clogs on the hard earth "What atrocious faces!" mumbled Mme Hennebeau. . . . Négrel said between his teeth: "Let the devil take me if I recognize one of them! Where are those hoodlums coming from?" . . . Anger, hunger, the two months of suffering and the wild stampede across the pits had turned the placid faces of the miners of Montsou into jaws of wild animals. . . . Then the road seemed to be laden with blood. . . . "Oh! Superb!" whispered Lucie and Jeanne, whose artistic taste was moved by this beautiful horror.</page><page sequence="18">1 12 Philippe Hamon Constituted as a "spectacle" by the evaluators-onlookers (Négral, Mme Hennebeau, Lucie, Jeanne) who judge it at once according to aesthetic norms (Jeanne is an amateur painter, Lucie sings) and ethical norms ("rascals"), described with an evaluative oxymoron ("beautiful horror") by the narrator himself, who comments as well ("confused howling," "murmured," "between his teeth," "whispered") on the speaking ability of his characters, the miner's strike is itself an infraction of the labor legislation and of the (bourgeois) code which regulates it and whose representative here is the engineer Négrel. The ethical, aesthetic, technical, linguistic norms interact here, the qualifier "beautiful" sending us back indirectly to the "beautiful" description which preceded, that is to say, to the narrator's own account (his stylistic and rhetorical competence), and thus constituting a sort of meta-evaluation incorporated into the text. The neuralgic point, the privileged ideological intersection of the text, then becomes, perhaps, the point where is produced one of those essentially over-determined objects, par excellence, a semiotic object: text, book, work of art, some symbolic or semantic figurative object, where most or all of the four levels of mediation that we have discussed cross: the linguistic (the book is a specimen of language), the technological (the book is well or badly bound, printed, written), the ethical (the subjects and the themes of the book can be suitable or unsuitable), and aesthetic (the book is also a stylistic and rhetorical work), as in the performative utterance, are here convoked and merged. Two examples from Zola (the first from Pot-Bouille [Restless House ] and the second from L'Oeuvre [The Masterpiece ]): (29) Ma fille n'avait pas encore lu un seul roman, à dix-huit ans passés . . . n'est-ce pas Marie? Oui papa. J'ai, continua M. Vuillaume, un George Sand très bien relié, et malgré les craintes de la mère, je me suis décidé à lui permettre, quelques mois avant son mariage, la lecture ď André, une oeuvre sans danger, toute d'imagination, et qui élève l'âme C'est si beau! murmura la jeune femme, dont les yeux brillèrent. Mais Pichón ayant exposé cette théorie: pas de romans avant le mariage, tous les romans après le mariage, Mme Vuillaume hocha la tête. Elle ne lisait jamais, et s'en trouvait fort bien. "My daughter had not yet read a single novel, and she was past eighteen . . . isn't that so, Marie?" "Yes, papa." "I have," continued M. Vuillaume, "a beautifully bound George Sand, and in spite of her mother's fears, I have decided to permit her, a few months before her marriage, to read André , an innocent work, all imagination, it lifts up the soul. . . ." "It's so beautiful!" murmured the young woman, whose eyes were shining. But since Pichón had put forward his theory: no novels before marriage, all novels after marriage, Mme Vuillaume shook her head. She never read anything, and was not worse off for it. (30) Fagerolles joua l'enthousiasme. "Comment! Mais c'est plein de qualités, ça! . . ." C'était un paysage d'un gris-perle, un bord de Seine soigneusement peint, joli de ton quoiqu'un peu lourd, et d'un parfait équilibre, sans aucune brutalité révolutionnaire." "Sont-ils assez bêtes d'avoir refusé ça!" dit Claude qui s'était approché avec intérêt. "Mais pourquoi, pourquoi, je vous le demande?". En effet, aucune raison n'expliquait le refus du</page><page sequence="19">Text and Ideology 1 1 3 jury. "Parce que c'est réaliste" dit Fagerolles, d'une voix si tranchante, qu'on ne pouvait savoir s'il blaguait le jury ou le tableau. Fagerolles feigned enthusiasm. "What! But it has a lot of good points! . . ." It was a pearl-gray landscape, a bank of the Seine carefully painted, a pretty tone though a bit overdone, and perfectly balanced, without any revolutionary brutality." "Are they stupid enough to have refused that!" said Claude who had approached, interested. "But why, why, I ask you?" In fact, no reason could explain the jury's refusal. "Because it is realistic," said Fagerolles, in such a cutting voice that it was impossible to tell if he was making fun of the jury or the painting. The plurality of evaluators (Pichón, Vuillaume, Madame Pichón, Marie in Restless House, Fagerolles, Claude, the Jury in the example from The Masterpiece) giving contradictory opinions on the same object, and elsewhere disqualified on other mediation levels in the course of the novel, facilitates the locating of this normative focal point of the text, but can render the interpretation of the normative intersection (where is Zola?) problematic.21 The character of the critic, professional specialist of evaluation, is a particu- larly interesting syncretic function: his seeing (aesthetic norm) which is also speaking (press articles: linguistic norm) is also a profession (a doing) bearing on the seeing (paintings) and the speaking (books) of the creators who are also technicians (technical code) and whose speaking or doing is, as well, subject to aesthetic and ethical codes ("subjects" of books and paintings which are suitable or unsuitable). Intertextuality, as a reservoir of auctores, objects of programs and of values already legitimized (see the reference to the "miraculous catch" in example 4 from Maupassant) certainly plays an important role for the concrete inscription in the text, and for the fixation in the collective conscious, of the proscriptive and prescriptive ideological canvases. It is at once a stock of models, already established bestseller lists, source, target, and means of normative interpretations. Foyer of ideological accommodation of the text, the intertextual quotation focuses and solicits the ideological competence of the reader. Every apparition in a text not only of a code, but also of a song (the Marseillaise in example 28 from Germinal), of a book, a library (the Saint- Victor library, in Rabelais; Nemo's in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, from which political works are banished), of a theory (Vuillaume's on the education of girls, in example 29), or any other mention of the name of an author or a stylistic object (Leonardo in example 20 from Proust), can thus be the signal for a reference, legitimatizing or challenging, serious or parodie, to a value or to a normative system which underlies it. There is a tendency, in every differed written text (as, notably, the literary text) to incorporate Norms in the form of citations, to inscribe the norms literally somewhere, a tendency to the ekphrasis of the normative (delegation to official or occasional evalu-</page><page sequence="20">1 14 Philippe Hamon ators - the Jury in example 30; inscription on concrete supports - books, pages, surfaces, cymas of exposition, libraries; emphasis and detached position - quotations and so forth); which does mean, we have just seen, that the source, the hierarchy, the origin, and the ultimate interpretation of norms which interfere and are concentrated in such points of the utterance are always easy to establish. In addition to the semiotic-symbolic object (books, texts, paintings, and so forth) dress will certainly be a privileged normative intersection as well. See, in example 16 from Stendhal, the "tall, well-built [young lady from Franch-Comté] dressed in a way that honored the cafe . . . her superb figure." The ethical (behavior, appearance in society), the aesthetic (the beautiful and the ugly, the canons of fashion, of taste), the technological (the construction and fabrication), and the communicative (the signals of the vestimentary .code) are always overdetermined here as well, not only paradigmatically, but syntagmatically (strategy of "deployed means" and of "goals" in the erotic conquest), and the "discrete" and articulated code of the processes which bring it into play ("the article" of clothing adjusted to the "articulations" of the body and to the differentiated "moments" of the social ritual) allows arrangements of all kinds.22 An example, taken from Balzac's La Vieille Fille ( The Old Maid): Quelques personnes pourraient croire que Mademoiselle Cormon cherchait tous les moyens d'arriver à son but; que parmi les légitimes artifices permis aux femmes, elle s'adressait à la toilette, qu'elle se décolletait, qu'elle déployait les coquetteries négatives d'un magnifique port d'armes. Mais point! Elle était héroïque et immobile dans ses guimpes comme un soldat dans sa guérite. Ses robes, ses chapeaux, ses chiffons, tout se confectionnait chez des marchands de modes d'Alençon, deux soeurs bossues qui ne manquaient pas de goût. Malgré les instances de ces deux artistes, Mademoiselle Cormon se refusait aux tromperies de l'élégance. Some people might believe that Mademoiselle Cormon sought any means to gain her end; that among the legitimate artifices permitted woman, she turned to her attire, bared her neckline, became coquettish, silently displaying her magnificent qualities like one displays a license to hunt. Not at all! She was as heroic and steadfast in her gown as a soldier in his sentry-box. Her dresses, her hats, her ribbons, everything was made by shopkeepers in Alençon, two hunch-backed sisters who didn't lack taste. In spite of the insistance of these two artists, Mademoiselle Cormon declined the deceits of elegance. As we know, in spite of the "means" "deployed" in intrigues and strategies, Mile Cormon will fail to attain her goals. And notice, in this text, the descriptive oxymoron (fashion and Alençon), the neutralizing inversion of normative schemes (the "hunch-backed sisters": the producers of the aesthetic are aesthetically disqualified characters), the concentration of mediation levels (the technical, aesthetic, ethical), and their semantic cacophony signaled by the analogous short-circuit, gown:woman::sentry-box:soldier. Thus is con- structed an ironic discourse, which can, from a certain threshold, pose problems of readability. Who is speaking? What is the origin and aim of the norms? Which norm dominates the other? (See the problematic "believing" of</page><page sequence="21">Text and Ideology 1 1 5 the reader, at the beginning of the quotation. Compare it to the undecidability provoked by the "joke" of the evaluating character - the art critic - in passage 30 from The Masterpiece quoted above and to the enunciative polyphony created by the intertextual citation.) The ideological focal points of the text are thus drawn, as well, to the attention of the reader by various emphasizing processes; besides the methods of concentration and of the intermeshing of the four levels of mediation, besides the method of quotation, they tend to become noticeable, be it by the inflation in the very lexicon of the text, of the vocabulary having a modal function (to believe, to want, to be able to, to know, to be obliged to, to be necessary to) or relating to law (the term "revolutionary" in example 30, the verb "to permit" in example 29, the expression "according to the rules" in example 14), or by the surfacing of the vocabulary of certain feelings and passions: in example 29 from Zola, we have just seen "fear" and "danger" invoked; in example 28 from Germinal, the "terror" of Mme Hennebeau, the "anger" and the "rage" of the miners; in example 30 the "enthusiasm" and the "interest"; in example 18 the "nausea"; in example 19 from Proust, the "suffering" of the narrator. Everywhere where there is a subject's "interest" implied in the mediated relation to the world, in the two senses of the word "interest" (desire oriented towards an object having an attractive or repulsive value; quantifiable profit, gain), there is an implicit norm called up. In many texts, in fact, terror, joy, jealousy, reference to a crisis or to a psychological paroxysm, and so forth, will only perhaps be the indirect, oblique signs of the confrontation of the character with norms, taboos, or interdictions. The "quest of fear" which is part of European folklore (from Brittany to Lithuania) seems to be the privileged narrative motive for this production of ideology as constraint: "not to be afraid" defines thus an ambiguous hero who is asocial and guilty of not respecting either the spiritual power (God) or the temporal power (parents, ancestors, king) and whose final legitimation can only be obtained by certain failures (he will be afraid, which is an equally negative factor on the level of the "success" of the normative.)23 A poetics of the passions would then be necessary, as a corollary to a poetics of ideology. Three problems remain in suspension: (a) the problem of the hierarchy of the four levels of mediation where the normative mechanisms and the focal points of the texts are concentrated. Hierarchies and dominants can vary within one text, or from one text to another. A quantitative hierarchy is not necessarily equivalent to a qualitative hierarchy. To the extent that language is "the interprétant" (Ben veniste) of other systems, to what extent do the linguistic values and evaluations (the speaking ability of the characters, or that of the narrator, which is also his specific ability to act) dominate the others? But isn't it also an ideological ruse to often valorize obliquely by interposed system, to manipulate indirect valorizations (the ethical by the aesthetic, or vice versa, and so forth)? Thus,</page><page sequence="22">1 1 6 Philippe Hamon through metaphoric play, normative interference: see in example 20, the housewife who performs her "duties" (ethical norm) "mechanically" (techno- logical norm); intersection, semantic short-circuit, the analogy emphasizes the normative intersection; (b) the preliminary theoretical outline of neuralgic points of the ideologi- cal effect of texts has the disadvantage of privileging, a priori, a cartography of strong points of this effect (overdetermined points, foyers of concentration and neutralization), to the detriment of a cartography of its weak points (things censored or implicit, erasures, lacunae, absences, and so forth), negative weak points, points of deflation, which are certainly as strong as the others. We have here returned to the problem of the absence, a difficulty which I pointed out at the beginning of this article, (c) the problem of the verification of these working hypotheses by "homologation" (Goldmann) of the textual structures with the extratextual social, economic, psychological structures, and so forth, is neither posed nor resolved in its double movement: influence of exterior norms on the constitu- tion of the normative apparatus of the texts, on the one hand, and constitu- tion, legitimation, formation, restoration of the non-textual normative exte- rior apparatus, on the other, by the texts themselves.24 The intertext, as a relay device which is at once legitimate and legitimizing (the auctores), as a prize list incorporated into the text, certainly plays an important intermediary role.25 But locating in a text the anchor points of value systems does not give direct information about their enunciative localization and origin , about their attribution (who utters them, speaks them), nor about their interpretation (who assumes them, which one is preferentially assumed). All that one gets hold of there, perhaps, is a diffused murmur of ideology (of History); (d) finally, the price of these working hypotheses can seem too high, because they require that an eventual poetics of the norm, or a "general deontology" (Oswald Ducrot) depend on a previous and more general theory of mediation, general and totalizing theory of modes of relation (tools, language, laws) of man to the world, a theory whose development is, at the very least, difficult and problematic.

Greimas: "The narrative utterances [énoncées] logically implied within the framework of a performance may be elliptic in the manifestation; the presence of the last link of the chain of implications ... is sufficient to operate, with a view to the reconstitution of the narrative unit, a catalysis which reestablishes it in its entirety" (Du sens [Paris: Seuil, 1970], p. 174). 10 An example of the explicit notation of an absence taken from Jules Verne, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea , Chapter XI: "I walked over to the library shelves. Books of science, ethics and literature, written in all languages, abounded; but I could not find a single book of political economics; they seemed to be severely proscribed." 1 1 Zola writes in "Le Naturalisme au théâtre": "In an historical drama, as in an historical novel, one must create or rather recreate the characters and their environment; it is not enough to use sentences found in documents; when such sentences are slipped in, they must be preceded and followed by sentences which have the same sound.

Bartlett lists five conditions which would make it possible to begin constructing a general theory of ellipsis, a theory whose first elements he borrows from Beauzée: "(1) translating a relation between the utterance and any underlying formulation; (2) linking one or several optional variations to a single underlying formulation; (3) permitting the distinguishing of the compulsory and optional obliterations; (4) depending, from the point of view of its supplements, upon a structure and elements of an abstract nature, and (5) incorporating, within the framework of a fully elaborated linguistic theory, formal means to supply the supplements in question" (Langue Française , No. 48 [1980], p. 11). See also on this subject (historical and methodological status of the ellipsis in grammar) the article by Marie-Thérèse Ligot, "Ellipse et présupposition," Poétique , No. 44(1980), pp. 422-436. 15 See A. J. Greimas, "Un problème de sémiotique narrative: les objets de valeur," Langages , No. 31 (1973), pp. 13-35. Bakhtine is certainly one of the first theoreticians who began an exploration of such poetics of the normative and the axiological. See the presentation of his work by Tzvetan Todorov, Mikhail Bakhtine, le principe dialogique (Paris: Seuil, 1981), p. 73ff. On the relation between norms, values, structure, and signification, see Jean Piaget, Epistèmologie des sciences de l'homme (Paris: Gallimard, 1972), p. 253 ff. 16 In Language in the Inner City (Philadelphia: Univ. of Pennsylvania Press, 1972), Chapter 9, William Labov notes that the evaluative structures vary according to the social classes and increase with age, and that they tend, in accounts of experiences, to concentrate in particular places in the utterance (in the fourth part of the five-phase diagram he proposes), while they can also be distributed in any place of the utterance. He then sketches a typology of the evaluations, essentially based on the degrees of implications of the narrator in his narration, and ends with four major classes of evaluations: the intensifications, the comparisons, the parallels, the explanations, each class including sub-classes of processes. 1 7 Problèmes de linguistique générale II (Paris: Gallimard, 1 974), p. 1 87. 18 Perrault, Contes (Paris: Garnier, 1967), p. 142. 19 We refer, for the narcological analysis of this short story, to A.

Greimas, Maupassant, la sémiotique du texte, exercices pratiques (Paris: Seuil, 1976). 20 For a beginning of a typology of textual descriptive reticulations, see Philippe Hamon, Introduction à l'analyse du descriptif ( Paris: Hachette, 1981).</page><page sequence="25">Text and Ideology 1 1 9 21 It is not only the localization of the source of the final evaluation which may be impossible to decide (where is Zola, in the end?), but the subject of the evaluation which is problematic: what is Zola (what are his characters) talking about? What is aimed at? Is it André (and only this novel) by George Sand? Is it all the novels by George Sand? Is it George Sand as a person, through the writer? Is it the contemporary idealist novel through George Sand? Is it the novel as a genre, in general? Is it Zola himself (or a certain Zola: the young Zola, a fervent reader and admirer of George Sand) who is Zola's target? In the example from The Masterpiece , the action takes place at the Exhibition of the "Rejected Ones." The "joke" of the art critic is also a factor of ambiguity which strikes at the very statement of the character. 22 See for example Odette de Crécy's portrait as drawn by Proust: "although she was one of the best dressed in Paris," she seemed "made of different parts ill-fitted to each other." 23 See, on this narrative theme, A.J. Greimas, "La quête de la peur, réflexions sur un groupe de contes populaires," in Du sens (Paris: Seuil, 1970). Hans Robert Jauss thus defines one of the roles of literature, its role in constituting the social reality: "Let the mute institutions which govern society speak, bring to the level of thematic formulation the norms which give proof of their value, transmit and justify those norms which are already traditional - but also bring out the problematic character of the constraint applied by the institutional world, shed light on the roles played by the social actors, create a consensus on the new norms being formed, and fight thus against the dangers of reification and alienation through ideology." Pour une esthétique de la réception (Paris: Gallimard, 1978), p. 269 ( Toward an Aesthetic of Reception, trans. Timothy Bahti, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1982). 25 One solution, which would be to leave systematically to the intertext of knowledge (all the scientific discourse of an era) the role of mediating authority between the text on the one hand and the ideological extratext on the other hand, could then be exploited. Michel Serres does this in his book - remarkable from various points of view - on Zola ( Feux et signaux de brume, Zola Paris: Grasset, 1975), a mimetic book in which the critical discourse (a rewriting of Zola's text by Serres' text) doubles the status of the analyzed discourse (Zola being engaged in rewriting the knowledge of his time and particularly that of thermodynamics). Ideology as well as its critical study would then come under a grammar of intertextuality and generalized rewriting, to be developed, into which it would merge. This essay was originally published in a slightly different version as "Teste et idéologie: Pour une poétique de la norme," Poétique , 49 (1982), pp. 105-25.</page></plain_text>
