<plain_text><page sequence="1">A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THE TEXT OF THE SYRIAC VERSION OF THE SONG OF SONGS BY DR. JOSHUA BLOCH New York University The fact that no ancient document handed down in manuscript is perfectly free from error has long been known, and that the Bible forms no exception to the rule is now generally admitted. It natu- rally follows that the Bible no less than other ancient documents is the object of textual criticism. The Old Testament, however, enjoys, a peculiarity of its own-a peculiarity which lies in the fact that the material for textual criticism is furnished by the ancient versions rather than ancient manuscripts. The ancient versions are of great weight as documents by the aid of which modern scholar- ship is enabled to reconstruct the original text of the Bible where the transmitted text is faulty, or to defend it where it is sound. In the words of Geiger, "Auffassung und Feststellung des Bibeltextes muss sich am Schdrfsten in den Uebersetzungen der verschiedenen Zeiten ausprigen."'1 The object of the present study is to examine a part of one of these versions and determine the nature and value of its testimony. The version is the Syriac translation of the Old Testament commonly called the Peshitta.2 It is indeed remarkable that to none of the ancient versions of the Bible has been paid as little attention as to the Syriac, which, owing to its great antiquity, is one of the most valu-. able documents in ascertaining the original text of the Bible. In fact, in point of age, the Peshitta takes precedence of every other oriental version; and such has been the high esteem in which it has been held by men of great eminence. There are problems presented by the Peshitta that still remain partly unsolved; particularly those 1 Urschrift und Uebersetzungen der Bibel, etc., p. 160. 2 Peshitta is the pronunciation according to the "Nestorian" system, which pre- serves the older sounds of the vowels, as in Talitha and Maranatha. The Monophysites and Maronites say PAshttt6. The word is a feminine adjective in the "definite" state, agreeing with mappaetd, i.e., "edition," but Bar Hebraeus sometimes used it by itself in the "absolute" feminine, hence the spelling Peshito. The form Peschito is merely an adaptation to German orthography. 103</page><page sequence="2">104 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES dealing with the question of the origin and authorship of that work. Almost at the outset of the study of the Peshitta one finds himself confronted by difficulties which can only be met by a study of the general purpose and character of that work, the limitations by which the translators were beset, and the principles which guided them in the performance of their task. The student of the Peshitta must begin by placing before his mind the conditions under which it was produced, and the relation of the original work to our present texts, Hebrew, Greek, and Syriac. Strictly speaking, the Peshitta is not a single version,' but a series of versions produced at various times and by translators whose ideals were not altogether alike. Internal evidence of this fact may be found in the varying standards of excellence which appear in different books or groups of books.2 The student must also endeavor to realize the condition of the Hebrew text which lay before the translators of the Peshitta. Although the text of the Hebrew Bible has undergone no material changes since the beginning of the second century C.E., the Peshitta nevertheless presents a version of an earlier text which often differed materially from the text of the printed Hebrew Bible and of all existing Hebrew manuscripts. All scholars who have perused the Peshitta of the Old Testament have arrived at the conclusion that it is a direct translation from the Hebrew, though not always corresponding exactly with the Masoretic text of our day. What text the translators may have used we can only conjecture. It differs here and there from our own, though the more important deviations are comparatively few. While one can safely assume that the Peshitta was executed entirely from the Hebrew, one must not overlook the fact that it underwent later revision which brought it more into conformity with the LXX- this to a greater degree in some books than in others.3 Whatever the case be, the Peshitta as a translation from the Hebrew, and 1 Heller, Untersuchungen iiber die Peschitta, etc., p. 37, claims that the Peshitta is the work of one author, though he admits the possibility of another author being responsible for Chronicles, because it consistently avoids anthropomorphic expressions. Cf. also Ne1deke, Alttestamentliche Litteratur, p. 264. 2 See my article "The Authorship of the Peshitta" in AJSL, XXXV (July, 1919), pp. 215-22. 3 See my article on "The Influence of the Greek Bible on the Peshitta," AJSL, XXXVI (January, 1920), pp. 161-66.</page><page sequence="3">THE SYRIAC VERSION OF THE SONG OF SONGS 105 evidently executed by able hands, may be regarded as a valuable instrument in ascertaining the state of the original text of the Old Testament at a very early period.' The critical and exegetical value of the Peshitta is now almost universally recognized. The study of its text, therefore, deserves the attention of scholars. Indeed, as early as 1832 Roediger2 pointed out the need of an analytical examination of the text of the Peshitta, as preparatory to an exhaustive treatment of the various problems it presents. Four decades later Baethgen3 stated explicitly that der einzige Weg, um zu einem selbstandigen Urteil und zu wenn auch nur relativer Klarheit zu kommen, ist demnach der, die einzelnen Biicher genau auf ihre Anlage, ihr Verhbiltnis zu unserm hebriiischen Text und den iibrigen alten Uebersetzungen, sowie auf etwaige Eigenttimlichkeiten in der Manier des Uebertragens zu untersuchen und aus diesen Einzeluntersuchungen ein Gesamtresultat zu ziehen. This task was subsequently undertaken by various students who have produced a series of studies dealing with the text of a large number of the books' of the Syriac Bible-all with but a few excep- tions are inadequately done. In the following pages it is proposed to present a study of the Syriac text of the Song of Songs in the light of the Masoretic text and the ancient primary versions of the Bible. The textual notes resolve themselves to a storehouse of observations concerning the 1 The favorable judgment which the Peshitta received at the hands of modern scholars was evidently not shared by the ancient students of the Bible. We find that for various reasons the use of the LXX or the Syro-Hexaplaric version was preferred by such Syrians as Theodore of Mopsuestia and Bar Hebraeus. Cf. Theodorus Mopsuest. inMai, Nov.

Bar Hebraeus attacked the Peshitta on linguistic grounds; e.g., Ps. 4:5 S has o, instead of oasi, .-. which would be expected (cf. Wiseman, Horae Syriacae, p. 106). He calls it \.i ~\h=A1 and wrote a treatise in which he endeavored to show "that the translation of LXX is more correct than the Peshitta." Cf. Assemani, Bibl.

All the editions of the Syriac text of this book have been continuously consulted and the variations indicated. It goes with- out saying that most of the important commentaries have been utilized with admiration and gratitude. The Syriac text of the Song of Songs has been printed six times. The editio princeps is that in the Paris Polyglot (1629-45) repro- duced without any improvements in the London Polyglot (1659). Lee in his edition of the Peshitta (1823) reprinted it again, omitting the vowels, introducing one better reading and retaining most of the misprints of the former editions. The text of the Paris Polyglot contains a misprint (8:5) corrected in the London Polyglot, which, on the other hand, allowed three new ones to creep in (1:5; 2:8; and 8:9). Lee, in his edition, reproduced these misprints and allowed a new one to slip in (4:1) while he corrected the one in 1:5. The Urmia edition of 1852 is a reproduction of Lee's text in Nestorian characters with Nestorian vowels and with improved spellings.' While some of Lee's misprints are corrected, no variation from it, unless supported by other evidence, can safely be considered a variant reading. Dr. Adolf Htibsch's text, printed in 1886 in his publication Die fiinf Megilloth nebst dem syrischen Thargum genannt "Peschito," is a mere reprint of the text of the Polyglots in Hebrew characters and vowels. Thus, these five editions are, but for Lee's one improvement, reducible to one edition; so that the editio princeps practically represents the present state of the printed text.2 The sixth issue published in Mosul in 1887 seems to have no independent value whatever. It differs from the Urmia edition in sixteen places, seven of which are mere orthographic differences. In these seven places the Mosul edition is perhaps better than that of Urmia. Another case involves merely a difference in punctuation; while two other readings are of no significance whatever. In the remaining six cases the readings of the Mosul text are supported by MSS, LXX, and Vulgate, which point to the probability of the editors having I See Barnes, Apparatus Criticus to Chronicles, etc., p. xv. 2Cf. my article "The Printed Texts of the Peshitta Old Testament" in AJSL, XXXVII (January, 1921), pp. 136-44.</page><page sequence="5">THE SYRIAC VERSION OF THE SONG OF SONGS 107 corrected the text. In all these cases, with but one exception (6:8), the Mosul edition has a very good reading. That this edition was not expressly altered to make it agree with the Vulgate can be seen from the fact that the variant in the text of the Songs of Songs 8:13 differs in its sentence arrangement from that of the Vulgate. While ample use was made of the ancient versions, no comparison was made between the Syriac text of the Song of Songs and the Targum. Such a comparison must be excluded because of the distance in age. The Peshitta could not have been influenced by the Targum, the date of the latter surely being several centuries later, for it mentions the Mohammedans (1:7), the Mishna, and the Talmud (1:2; 5:10).' Besides, the Targum and the Peshitta differ entirely in their character. The Peshitta is a literal version of the Hebrew text, while the Targum is a Midrash-like commentary. Following the example of Barnes2 and Baumann,3 no use was made of the Arabic version or of patristic quotations. The Arabic version promises some help, but, as was already pointed out by Barnes,4 "it must be edited before it can be used." Patristic quotations, on the contrary, are unpromising. Aphraates and Ephraim, moreover, can be used for the most part in an uncritical edition only. The five quotations found in Bar Hebraeus and the half-passage in Aphraates5 are worthless for textual criticism6 while the writings of Philoxenus contain no quotation from the Song of Songs. The biblical quotations in the writings of the church fathers are useful as evidence of the characteristics of the translations which they employed; but as a rule they did not aim at strict accuracy of reference so that their citations cannot always have the authority to overrule the verdict of the ancient codices.7 Much material, interest- ing both in itself and in connection with the present subject, has been simply referred to, or relegated to a footnote, because it is of a kind accessible to students. 1 See Zunz, Gottesdienstliche Vortrdge der Juden (2d ed.), p. 68. 2 Barnes, op. cit., p. viii. 3 Baumann, Die Verwendbarkeit der Pegita zum Buche Ijob, etc., p. 329. 4 Op. cit., p. viii. 5 Dem. vi. de monachis 19 (ed.

The Hebrew text of Canticles has no title, the superscription (1:1) having been added at a later date. This is agreed by all commentators on the ground of the demonstrative pronoun made use of, which differs from that used throughout the book. (See Budde, Hohelied, p. xxi.)

See II Sam. 6:19 (with Driver's note); I Chron. 16:3; Isa. 16:7 (with Cheyne's note); Hos. 3:1 (adds Cf).

CONCLUSION In these notes on the Syriac text of the Song of Songs an endeavor was made to illustrate the departure of the Peshitta from the accepted vocalization, punctuation, and interpretation of single words in the Masoretic text.

By way of summing up the material which is necessarily scattered in the notes, an effort will now be made to present the results which were arrived at in the course of the study of the Syriac text of the Song of Songs. It is believed they will be of some help in estimating the value of the Peshitta for the textual criticism of the Song of Songs. The Syriac version of the Song of Songs is a literal rendition of the Hebrew text; but while literal, it is not slavish, and its style is smooth and flowing. Indeed, it is well done and compares well with many modern versions in respect to reproducing the exact meaning of the original. In this respect the Peshitta of the Song of Songs almost supersedes all other ancient versions of this book.1 When the translator here and there permits himself certain liberties, they are to be regarded either as products of the translator's insufficient knowledge of the richiess of the Hebrew language (e.g., 1:3; 2:5; 4:1), or caused by the poverty in the vocabulary of the Syriac tongue and by its inability to reproduce the precise meaning of Hebrew poetic expressions,2 and they may also be due to the possi- bility of the Peshitta having been made from a Hebrew text differing from that of the Masoretic (e.g., 1:4; 2:17; 7:3), for it actually presupposes a Hebrew original slightly differing from that now in our possession. In all cases where the Peshitta appears to have been made from a Hebrew text varying from the present Masoretic text it is important to examine carefully whether the ancient Hebrew text from which it was made, and which must have been much older 1 To prove this assertion the following three examples will suffice: (a) 1:3: ' Mw l=~ f1Z; I t ?

It evidently took rjj an and V not as plurals of r"= and b I or ?". respectively, but rather as of N= and ?bwi. The Vulg. which is so largely dependent upon the LXX here deviates from it.

It is an indisputable fact that in the printed text of the Peshitta words and even verses are not infrequently wanting. This has probably arisen from the worn and defective state of the MSS from which the text has been printed and the very few MSS which have been collated. That in many cases they arose chiefly from defects in the copies of the Syriac version which have been consulted, appears from the fact that in almost every instance, so far as our examination has extended, the omitted passage is preserved in one or all of the primary versions of the Bible. On the other hand, there are a number of passages concerning which we have no reason to suppose that the Hebrew original from which the Peshitta was made differed from our present Masoretic text. The translator has expressed, in language nearly, though not literally, corresponding to the Hebrew, the sense of the original. For it must be remembered that the Hebrew language is proverbially concise, and consequently not infre- quently obscure. The Syriac translator, familiar with the Hebrew, sometimes conveys its sense more clearly and fully. True, while the Peshitta seems to'have been made from a text differing slightly from the received Hebrew text, it must not be overlooked that these differences mostly relate to matters of very little, if of any, consequence, sometimes making a passage clearer; and there are also places where the Peshitta presents a better reading than does the Masoretic text or explains a difficult word in the Hebrew text (e.g., 1:2; 2:17; 6:9). There are cases where the Syriac does not differ so much from the Masoretic text as a casual reference to that version might lead one to suppose. In some cases the difference is merely in the position of the pauses (cf. 7:6), or of vowel points (cf. 2:4), the Syriac words according with the Hebrew. However, in some cases a transposition of words is evident (cf. 2:5, 13). All this points to the fact that the Hebrew text used as basis for the Peshitta was entirely unvocalized. Great liberties are taken in the Peshitta with the prefix I. In some places where the Hebrew text does not have it the Peshitta presents it, and vice versa (e.g., 7:13; 8:14). Nor are Hebrew infinitives carefully treated in the Peshitta (cf. 6:11). while the</page><page sequence="35">THE SYRIAC VERSION OF THE SONG OF SONGS 137 interrogative 1 1Z '1l 7 in 5:8 is converted in the Peshitta into an imperative. Not infrequently does the Syriac Bible present a reading different from the Hebrew original, caused by a difference in the reading of vowels or the elimination of words found in the Hebrew text (e.g., 1:16) or the addition of words not represented in the Hebrew original (e.g., 4:16), which, of course, should not be attributed to the carelessness of the translator, but rather to the fact that his text may have differed from that now in our possession. Most remarkable is the manner of the translator in rendering proper names. The Peshitta does not hesitate to translate such a name as i171 by the plural oi . Only such popular names as Jerusalem and Lebanon are correctly preserved in %. There can be no question therefore that in this manner the Peshitta was influenced by LXX (e.g., 4:3,11). Very likely with the author of the Peshitta it was merely a matter of accuracy to translate whatever could be translated, which is not the case with the Targum. In the latter the allegorical motive, in a most exaggerated form, is exhibited particularly in the rendering of proper names.' Again, in some places the Peshitta has unnecessary repetition of expressions (e.g., 5:1) which is undoubtedly due to the careless- ness of the copyist rather than to the fault of the translator. An examination of MSS evidence shows this to be the case (see note on 5:1). On the other hand, the Peshitta omits one word in a sentence where the preceding passage closes with the plural of that word. Perhaps the translator regarded it as an unnecessary repetition, as in 4:14. It was already pointed out that the author of the Peshitta allows himself certain liberties in the manner of his translation. Occasionally the translator endeavors to amend the text, while at other times he will render it very freely (e.g., 1:6), though as a whole the Peshitta is faithful to the Hebrew and in some places renders the original slavishly (e.g., 1:13). Very frequently the Syriac differs entirely from the Hebrew original. This may chiefly be noticed in passages of acknowledged difficulty. Thus it is quite remarkable to find a difficult Hebrew word rendered by a likewise difficult and ' Thus, e.g., nln'ri is rendered in the Targum by w'irl.071 -Ilty Ir 7,TCy; for nfl~1f the Targum has I' g1w Z Mn=;; j1jtZ is rendered in the Targum by "=VI wfI' 7 pl  l'tI "J'112V ==I %tt 7 .7wi</page><page sequence="36">138 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES unintelligible Syriac expression (e.g., 1:4). Again, in other places a false root determination is noticeable (e.g., 1:7). Finally we must not overlook such deviations from the Hebrew text as the emendation of an absolute state with rx to the construct state (e.g., 1, 6); the use of a proper name in the singular where the Hebrew has a plural (e.g., 1:14), and vice versa (e.g., 2:2), and the real singular for such with a pronominal suffix of the first person (e.g., 5:2); the application of an actual plural suffix of the first person in the plural (e.g., 5:1). Likewise, the pronominal suffix of the second person for the third (e.g., 1:4); the pronominal suffix of the first person plural for the first person singular (e.g., 8:2), and the attachments of pronominal suffixes where they are absent from the Hebrew text (e.g., 8:5); the application of the first person plural for that of the third person (e.g., 1:3); the plural imperative for the singular (e.g., 1:7), and the conversion of a relative passage to that of a copulative one (e.g., 4:15); the attachment of the relative prefix where it is absent from the Masoretic text( e.g., 7:3), indicating the relative upon another name (e.g., 6:5); the dividing of one word into two parts,' etc. Despite all these differences between the Masoretic text and that of the Peshitta, there can be no doubt that the Peshitta text of the Song of Songs was made from a Hebrew original differing but slightly from that now in our possession. Further evidence of this theory is found in the fact that some Hebrew words are preserved in the Syriac version. Thus, e.g., the Hebrew "'11, which the Greek renders by eXq5bLt6s uov, is translated in the Syriac text ded(j) although it conveys a different meaning from that of the Hebrew word. Though there is no room to doubt that the Peshitta was made directly from the Hebrew, yet there are many passages in which it exhibits a departure from our Hebrew text and agrees with the LXX (e.g., 1:6; 4:1-2). There are two theories about this; either the Syriac translator availed himself of the assistance of the LXX where he did not comprehend the Hebrew, or, which is more likely, that it is due to later ages having corrupted the Peshitta by consciously adopt- ing some of the translations of the LXX.2 In the case of the Song of 1 See, e.g., 7:7 and cf. our note ad loc. 2 See our discussion of the "Influence of the Greek Bible on the Peshitta," in AJSL, XXXVI (January, 1920), pp. 161-66.</page><page sequence="37">THE SYRIAC VERSION OF THE SONG OF SONGS 139 Songs the agreements of the Peshitta with LXX against the Masoretic text may be due to the fact that the Hebrew MSS used for LXX were of the same nature as those used for the Peshitta, having been entirely unvocalized and written in continuo. The differences in the texts are to be found in comparatively few places and these are mostly due to false word divisions or incorrect vowel readings. Hence no influence of LXX can be pointed to. Of the few (about twelve) places where the Peshitta agrees with LXX against the Masoretic text five only can, more or less, be considered as possible, but no absolute conviction can be derived from them. As a whole the Peshitta, as a version, is quite good. In its word arrangements it agrees, with but a few exceptions, with the Masoretic text. While the translation is not a servile one, it is nevertheless true to the original. Additions are very few, and in most cases they are borrowed from parallel places. The omissions are hardly worth while mentioning. Only one passage is para- phrased (7:11) while the Peshitta suffers in several places from cor- ruption. What, then, is its value for the textual criticism of the Song of Songs ? Since the Peshitta is a servile version, the translator, allow- ing himself certain occasional liberties, particularly in difficult places, while in other places corrupted readings are transmitted, it must be used with great care in the criticism of the Hebrew text of the Old Testament. Only in cases where the Peshitta reading is difficult, or cannot be explained other than as a diversion from the Masoretic text, or when its reading is attested by other evidence (LXX, Aq., Sym., Theod., Vulg., and MSS) can it be utilized profit- ably for the criticism of the Masoretic text. The Peshitta is in most cases rather a favorable witness for the Masoretic text than its critic. Cornill's conclusion regarding the Syriac text of Ezekiel' is equally applicable to that of the Song of Songs: Aus allem dem geht hervor, dass 5 als Zeuge fiir die alttestamentliche Textkritik nur mit der gr6ssten Vorsicht zu beniitzen ist. Doch thut das ihrem hohen Werthe keinen Eintrag; fiir die exegetische Tradition ist sie ein Hauptzeuge, und dabei bietet sie uns doch eine Anzahl von wirklich guten Lesarten.
