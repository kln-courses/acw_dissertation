<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DALY RIVER TRIBES A REPORT OF FIELD WORK IN NORTH AUSTRALIA By W. E. H. STANNER (Continued from previous issue) (6) The Ritual Life. '"THERE is no extensive ritual at birth. The woman is usually isolated * from the rest of the camp, particularly from children and men, and is assisted in parturition by older women relatives. Mention has already been made of the restrictions placed upon a pregnant woman in respect to tyayait food, but these cease after the birth of the child. Until puberty is near, the child does not need to observe the tyayait prohibitions. Judged by the attitude to the other major crises of life, as puberty, marriage, and death, the natives seem to regard birth as a comparatively unimportant affair. Infanticide and abortion were common formerly and probably also cannibalism. A child is usually not named for about two years. Ordinarily it is given only one name at first, but there is nothing to prevent its having more than one. By the time adult years are reached every man and woman has several personal names, one of which is nearly always a "nick-name," and the others (with some exceptions) names of relatives. There is definite sexual differentiation in personal names. A boy commonly takes the name of his father, or his father's father, or perhaps a brother of one of these. He need not necessarily be named after a relative at all. Two brothers sometimes have the same name. There is no rule, however, and name inheritance does not always hold. There is a difference of opinion whether it is right to call a child by the name of someone living who is not a close relative, though genealogies show that this has happened fairly frequently. One direct cause of multiple names is the strict prohibition against the use by another person of the name of someone who has died recently. Thus every death may mean the immediate assump-</page><page sequence="2">THE DALY RIVER TRIBES n tion of a new name by someone still in the community of the living who has shared a name with the dead person. Names given natives by white people have a useful function here in being exempt from this prohibition, just as beef may be eaten by a native to whom all meat is tyayait. Beef is " another kind of meat," and white names are " another kind of name." In addition to these purely personal names, a great number of kinship terms and terms indicating social status are used towards each individual, e.g., terms for the various stages of initiation ; terms for a woman before and after child-birth ; terms for the single, the married, for widows and widowers ; and terms for people in broad age groups. The native theory of sex, and the beliefs concerning conception and pregnancy, are discussed later. The rites at puberty are now for all river tribes the most important of their remaining ritual. In the midst of generalized ritual decay they stand nearly unaltered. The circumcision cere- monies attending puberty are eagerly looked forward to and vividly remembered as the most spectacular events of tribal and inter- tribal social life. At the moment these ceremonies have special significance. When a boy is between twelve and fifteen his father makes secret arrangement with men of another tribe to seize the boy suddenly and take him away to their country. Both the captors and the country to which the boy is taken are termed mamakaloan throughout the ceremonial period. The boy's own country is mununuk, and it is to mununuk (the ceremonial ground) that he is returned by mamakaloan after an indeterminate period ranging from days to six or seven weeks. During this period he has no communi- cation whatever with his own people. He is completely isolated, and undergoes a most rigid discipline. He must not immerse in water. He must eat sparingly and only of certain foods. The rest are tyayait. He must not laugh or be boisterous. He may talk only to certain people. He must go through prescribed ritual forms. The function of them all in part is to impress him deeply with the gravity of his position. This is the open, calculated purpose of the old men from the time when his circumcision becomes a possibility. This part of initiation is made a searching emotional experience as</page><page sequence="3">12 THE DALY RIVER TRIBES well as a dramatic climax to boyhood, and is accompanied by priva- tion, rigid discipline, and much awe-inspiring ritual. Among the Mulluk Mulluk and Madngella initiation falls naturally into four periods : (i) an indeterminate period of isolation in mamakaloan, during which both mununuk and mamakaloan make preparations for the return and circumcision of the boy ; (2) a period of two or three days during which the boy is returned to mununuk, and is circumcised. During this period public interest and excitement reach an extreme pitch and the normal life of the community is suspended. It is also a favoured time for the public discharge of grievances which have accumulated since the last ceremony ; (3) a period of about a week while the boy awaits the healing of his wound and then undergoes a ritual washing. Throughout this period, as from the moment of his return to mununuk, the boy is in a relation of warbat, or complete silence, with mamakaloan ; (4) an indeter- minate period in which he re-enters the normal life of his group, assumes his new status, and resumes in the old or now modified forms the associations which have been ruptured by the impact of the puberty rites. The warbat silence is now ended and normal relations resumed between mamakaloan and mununuk by a ceremonial exchange of gifts. Each of these four periods is marked by cere- monial, strongly conventionalized behaviour, and sometimes special terminolegy. This pattern of initiation at puberty is typical of all river tribes. But with the Nangiomeri and the Marithiel there are important differences of general initiation. The Marithiel distinguish two further initiatory stages, both associated with ceremonies, and marked by extreme secrecy. Information about them was very difficult to obtain. One of them takes place when a boy is about six or seven, and the other perhaps about ten years after he has passed through the rites at puberty. The Nangiomeri pass through a second initiation after the ceremony at puberty, but not through the earlier ceremony of the Marithiel. Much esoteric knowledge of songs, dances, mythology, and of religious sacra is acquired at these post-puberty ceremonies. All such knowledge is jealously guarded from the uninitiated, from other tribesmen, and from whites. I had to wait for over four months before it was revealed to me, and</page><page sequence="4">THE DALY RIVER TRIBES 13 then only on the condition that I kept it secret. It is impossible now to establish definitely whether the Mulluk Mulluk and Madngella once possessed similar post-puberty ceremonies. It is possible that they did, but there are many gaps in their cultures, especially in their secret life, about which it is idle to speculate. In those tribes which do distinguish several stages of initiation, special terms of status and of address are characteristically associated with each stage of initiation reached. Initiation is more than the dramatization of an individual life crisis. It is far more than mere circumcision. The rites at puberty, no matter how dramatic their emphasis, only punctuate by formal organized ceremonial a social process that runs far deeper and wider. The same applies to the further rites of the Nangiomeri and Marithiel. In time, in significance for individual and group, initiation is no affair of the moment. For perhaps fifteen years it is a rod which disciplines the very routine of daily life. The conduct of the individual during this period is heavily charged with significance for his later life. The dominantly active role in initiation is taken by the society : it makes the boy an adult. The change does not just come by itself : it is produced in him by the society. The evidence for this is unmistakable. For weeks at a time initiation ceremonies may canalize the life of two or three tribes, and suspend the normal routine. Then inter-tribal importance formerly was clearly very great. Under existing conditions, in which they are so little altered, the importance is relatively greater. In ways which cannot be dealt with here, the various initiation ceremonies, especially those at puberty, have spectacular social functions of a political, juridical, and economic nature. Puberty in women is marked by less elaborate ritual. At the onset of menstruation the girl is isolated outside the dirawur. Strict conventions of behaviour are imposed on her, the three most important being the same as for a boy about to undergo circumcision - the complete avoidance of water except for drinking, no speech or association with the other sex, and the assumption of a subdued, grave, submissive demeanour. The period ended, the girl undergoes a ritual washing, and then rites of reaggregation are carried out. Special emphasis is laid upon the resumption of social relationship</page><page sequence="5">14 THE DALY RIVER TRIBES with men who are neda, or " brother " to her. Complete avoidance from these during her menstruation is most rigidly observed. As with the ending of the warbat silence between an initiated boy and mamakaloan, an exchange of food gifts ends the ban of silence between dandgagaiak (a girl who has commenced her menses) and her neda. During subsequent periods the avoidance is reimposed, but somewhat less rigidly. Marriage for a girl usually follows soon after puberty. A betrothed girl may even stay in camp with her future husband before she has reached puberty. Sexual relations are not supposed to take place. Marriage for a boy may be delayed for many years after initiation. Among the Nangiomeri and Marithiel it is not permitted until some time after the third stage of initiation, i.e., when a man is in his late 'teens or early twenties. Often a man is much older before he marries. The normal method of securing a mate is by betrothal in infancy, and by exchange of sisters. Marriages are often arranged for children before they are born. When there has been no early betrothal, young men often arrange their marriages through intermediaries. They may, but do not like, making a personal approach to the woman's parents. A man may also obtain a mate by malwa, or abduction. This was formerly very common, and was a prolific cause of conflict. Though still practised by bush tribes and Marithiel, it has been abandoned by most river natives. Before the coming of whites, women captured in raids and fights were also kept as wives. Polygyny was formerly the rule, and still is among Marithiel and bush tribes, although viewed with what may be a pretence of disfavour by Mulluk Mulluk, Madngella and Nangiomeri. The levirate exists among all tribes, but the Nangiomeri do not approve of a woman passing to the blood-brother of a man. It must be to a classificatory brother. There is no marriage ceremony except that of bringing a woman to one's camp and sleeping with her between the fires of the wanthi. The sexual aspect of marriage is by no means dominant. Marriage has as well an economic side of great importance. The main significance of local polygyny is in the economic sphere, and many natives are frank about this. It is not suggested that polygyny does not often arise through sexual attraction, but it would be</page><page sequence="6">THE DALY RIVER TRIBES 15 thoroughly misleading to overemphasize the part it plays. Marriage, whether polygynous or not, as a permanent union following betrothal, does not receive its full public sanction (by the groom's kué feasts to the bride's relatives) until after the birth of children. But it must be remembered that sexual union, in native theory, is not responsible for conception. Moreover, sexual experience outside marriage is common, if not universal. People need not wait for marriage to obtain sexual satisfaction. Even before puberty children are making crude sexual experiments. As shown elsewhere in this report, serious discussion of sexuality with most natives is nearly impossible, but it is clear that a variety of sexual experience comes to girls and youths as they grow. Casual encounters in the bush, adolescent love affairs, adultery (apparently not infrequent), and several forms of sanctioned licence, leave few uninitiated into sexual love by the time they reach late youth. Chastity is regarded as of very little importance. Short transient unions between young men and women are characteristic of the native societies at the moment. There is no reason to think that these impermanent unions are a product of the altered condition of the societies, but they are clearly a symptom of disequilibrium, for they occur now much more frequently than before. Many young men and women have expressed to me a distaste for " permanent " marriage. Nevertheless, some such unions are prolonged indefinitely until they are regarded in much the same way as marriages which have followed orthodox betrothal. It is interesting to note that the economic efficiency of the partner in such a union is a common reason for prolonging it. Liaisons are no barrier to marriage with other mates. When marriage follows formal betrothal, divorce is only possible for the Mulluk Mulluk and Madngella when serious defect by one partner makes the marriage intolerable. This rarely happens, but when it does divorce is readily seen to be the best thing for everybody. Sufficient grounds for divorce, such as repeated adultery, or extreme laziness, give the dirawur good reason to sanction divorce. Its interests as well as those of the wronged individual are affected. The fault is invariably construed to be on the woman's side. In fact, the entire psychic relationship of the sexes is one of great social significance : there is much distrust, hostility and insinuation of misconduct between</page><page sequence="7">i6 THE DALY RIVER TRIBES them ; jealousy, suspicion of infidelity, and endless quarrelling with and over women, strike a constant strident note in dirawur life ; and the working of social mechanisms which function to subordinate women socially (e.g., abduction, sexual licence, and certain conventions of love-making) tend to induce psychic unrest. Men generally attribute a series of undesirable qualities to women. They are held to be faithless, untrustworthy, sexually insatiable, and to talk too much. In the temporary unions mentioned above women may be dismissed at the whim of the man, and women are invariably blamed for whatever adultery and elopement take place. Numerous cases were recorded of illegal marriages, but great caution was necessary in dealing with instances of apparent irregu- larity. It is fairly common to find marriages which in fact are correct and legal but which appear to be incorrect (i.e., in kinship terminology) from the point of view of other people. Thus, of two men who are distant neda to each other, one may call a woman narjul (wife) and the other kilur/ (mother). This differentiation does not itself depend upon an earlier irregularity (although such cases do occur), but would seem to be part of the normal functioning of a practical system in the normal drift from the ideal. Such marriages never appear to the natives as irregular : the terminological situation interests them when pointed out, but there is no suggestion of the admitted illegality which marks certain other marriages. Most of these are due directly or indirectly to the scarcity of women of the right relationship. Resentment at such marriages has worn itself out, except where other tribes are concerned, and it is a favourite gibe that the Marithiel marry anyone. The position in the kinship system of the children of irregular marriages is reckoned through whichever parent is more closely related to the individual concerned. Both kinship and local principles have a place in this decision, thus making choice sometimes difficult where the issue is not clear. The full resources of genealogical knowledge are thus sometimes drawn upon. Contrary to the usual Australian principle of " throwing away the father " when reckoning the position of children whose parents have married irregularly, the tendency here seems to be to reckon through the father in the absence of a strong matrilineal lead. There is no illegitimacy. A child whose father is not known (as in</page><page sequence="8">THE DALY RIVER TRIBES 17 the case of a woman who conceives by another man after the death of her husband, and does not remarry) always has a kaka, or mother's brother, to give it social status. Orthodox marriage with a betrothed brings in its train for a man enduring economic obligations towards his wife's relatives. Such linkages are associated with very strong conventions of behaviour. It is significant that the two most important ties arising in this way among the Mulluk Mulluk and Madngella, the kué and the warutjutj, arise only through marriage with the orthodox mate, i.e., the distant m.b.d. or f.s.d., and not usually through any other marriage. This draws a distinction of great functional importance between the orthodox marriage and the legal alternative marriages outlined earlier. From other points of view also the marriages are conceived differently by the natives. The kué referred to is a series of ceremonial feasts which a man prepares for his wife's parents and close relatives, at the direction of the wife's mother. The warugug links a man and his brother-in-law {atu), in a rather more diffuse relationship, which consists primarily of the obligation to send regularly to the wife's brother gifts of food and articles of value. Around both kué and warutjutj other patterns, economic and ceremonial, have been woven. Many other relationships are set up by marriage, such as the anbiitjgiil relationship between a woman and her husband's brothers and sisters, and the küyürjdüt relationship between a woman and her husband's narjor. These cannot, however, be entered into here, except to mention that their significance is mainly in economics and camp domestics. Conflict. The conflicts in which a native may be involved fall into a number of named and clearly defined types. These are : (1) daiiman, a camp brawl with the handiest weapons, often arising over the theft of firewood ; (2) nunuk, the domestic quarrel of a man and his wife ; (3) mamakwarurj , the public duel between a woman's seducer and the man to whom she is betrothed ; (4) dawor, the formal fight between groups (hordes or tribes) over the abduction of women ; (5) ninymernuy, a fight between individuals and (probably) groups of individuals over defections in merbok ; (6) yerenuk, the most serious conflict that can befall. It is between tribes, or allied groups of tribes, in retaliation for a murder by</page><page sequence="9">i8 THE DALY RIVER TRIBES mamakpik, the sorcerer. Daiiman, nunuk and mamakwarut) were rarely very serious, although deaths have been caused by them. The others are regarded much more gravely, and are nearly always attended by casualties, and often by deaths. The specific object of yerenuk was to kill as many as possible. There are conventional methods of declaring grievances, arranging the fighting ground and conducting the fight itself. (7) Economics. The present economic life of river tribes bears only faint semblance to its original. White and Chinese contact with the natives has been predominantly economic in motive. Even the Mission of 1890 is said to have made extensive use of native labour. In contact with new motives, new incentives, unfamiliar types of economic activity and new modes of organization, the pursuit of end-results without parallel in their own scheme, native economic institutions have been rapidly debilitated. Most natives now pretend to a showy familiarity with white methods and incentives, but it goes little deeper than pretence. What might be called the minutice of aboriginal economic life - the daily hunting and collecting of food ; the methods of procuring it ; the preparation of meals ; the collection of firewood ; the organization and clearing of dirawur sites ; the moving of the dirawur; the manufacture of weapons, ornaments, camp equipment, nets, and other articles ; and the sexual division of function throughout this range of activities - follows broadly the common Australian pattern, and will not be discussed further. More detailed mention may be made, however, of the institutions of the larger economy and their working. The horde itself sometimes acted as a unit in fishing and hunting, under the direction of the old men. It appears always to have moved camp as a unit when following food sources. From two to five neighbouring hordes often associated in group fishing and hunting. Patterns of behaviour associated with these were highly organized. Little room was left for uncertainty or dispute in organization of such ventures, or for trouble over sharing the product. Customary standards and methods were a constant safeguard. Within the horde there was much fortuitous association</page><page sequence="10">THE DALY RIVER TRIBES 19 in the economics of daily life between individuals and between families, for reasons of friendship, close kinship ties, special ability with spear or throwing stick, and so on. A common working team was formed by a man's sister and his wife, the sister coupling the roles of chaperon and friend. The domestic economy of the horde patterned itself unobtrusively along the lines of the kinship structure. It is failing to do so now, but every man and woman is still saddled with specific and more diffused economic obligations. Even before puberty, but to a diminishing extent to-day, children begin to assume the economic roles which normally become so important in later life. Before marriage a man's chief economic obligations are to (a) his narjoYy to which he must bring a constant stream of food ; (b) his dirawur, which by well-defined custom shares in the product of a good day's hunt ; (c) the parents and near relatives of his future wife, whose bad opinion might mean the loss of his paléet, his betrothed ; (d) his partners in merbok (to be described later). In addition to these, he was continually being drawn through kinship affiliations into assisting others to discharge their own obligations. Marriage lessened the drain of none of these, and added new complexity to most of them. Werag obligations were now added to his narjor obligations. After his marriage, a series of ceremonial kué feasts had to be prepared for his wife's mother, father and other close relatives. This often took years to discharge, and could bear down upon him very onerously. His merbok transactions became more involved. The growth of his children to puberty, with betrothal and marriage following, made fresh economic charges on him. Even at death, as at all other crises in life, his economic efficiency was drawn upon. Until old age overtook him, both natjor and werag still made their claims. Then the yield of his own efficiency returned to him, if he had managed his affairs judiciously. Of course, he had received as well as given throughout life, for the obligatory economic ties which linked him with some people linked still others with him, and as some drew on him, he drew on others. Sister's husband, daughter's husband, son's wife and her brothers, as well as his own werag, now became his gift-givers. Food, tobacco, clothes, hair-belts, ornaments, all came through them to him.</page><page sequence="11">20 THE DALY RIVER TRIBES Merbok is an exceedingly well-organized system of inter-tribal exchange which has joined every tribe between the Adelaide river and the Victoria river, perhaps even further, in a vast economic network. Almost certainly it extends, or did extend, far beyond these points. Its bases are a series of continuous, delayed exchanges of articles of intrinsic, utilitarian value between individuals within the one tribe, and in different tribes. Red ochre, kaolin, spears, hair-belts, dilly-bags, boomerangs, pearl shell, necklaces, arm- bands, girdles, wax, and numerous other articles pass along from individual to individual on traditional routes. The inter-tribal economy tends to draw certain articles in one direction, and send other articles in the opposite direction. To a great extent the flow in each direction is thus governed by the demand for certain articles. For example, bamboo is sent hundreds of miles from the Daly to the Victoria river to make the shafts of shovel-spears, since there is said to be no local bamboo on the Victoria river. This is multiplied a hundredfold in the merbok economy : a vast network of exchanges results. Merbok is a dominant influence in daily life. The planning of coups ; the calculation of merbok income as against merbok debts, disproportion in which may lead to deep humiliation, bad feeling, conflict, and even death ; the organization or carrying out of visits to receive or pay merbok ; the intense gratification, the added prestige, of having made successful merbok ; and most important of all, the realization that the merbok partner must before long reciprocate with equal or greater liberality, brought to everyday life interest, absorbing preparation, and either a pleasant sense of completion or an equally pleasant anticipation. Though devoid of ceremonial, merbok transactions were not simply utilitarian. Merbok partners were always friends, and sometimes much closer than friends, being linked by the most intimate bonds of kinship. Thus, a common pattern of merbok exchange was for an article to pass from a man to his wife, to her brother, and then to his wife, i.e., to the first man's sister, and then perhaps through the children of one of the marriages to a more distant partner. The husband- wife, parent-child, wife's brother-ego's sister, merbok patterns are very common, or were very common, for the general decay of native institutions has seriouslv damaged the merbok network.</page><page sequence="12">THE DALY RIVER TRIBES 21 Entire tribes have dropped out. Only a few partners are to be found. There is general impoverishment in articles suitable for exchange. But nterbok still goes on. How deeply it is rooted in something more than material gain is shown by the persistence of nterbok associations when all possibility of utilitarian benefit is gone. A much thinner stream of valuables does still pass along the traditional routes, supplemented now by European clothes, coloured beads, tobacco, and manufactured articles. The importance of the exchange is still great, although much of its former spirit, volume, intricate patterns, and associated conventions have disappeared. (8) Religion, For the Mulluk Mulluk and Madngella the religious background of life has almost disappeared. Most of their own beliefs have been forgotten, and they retain only a few scraps of the Christian theology taught them forty years ago. Other tribes, such as the Nangiomeri and Marithiel, which have not suffered the same cultural shock, retain their beliefs to a much greater extent. Bush tribes like the Nangor and Moiil, with which the writer made no effective contact, seem, on native reports, to be very little altered. All river tribes hold strong belief in immortality. The human soul (mir) or personality, variously conceived by different tribes, survives death, or through death enters in a new form a new existence in a country far away near where the sun rises. The Mulluk Mulluk call this Anmel, a land where no living person has been, and whence none returns. The belief varies in detail between individuals, but there is general belief in the existence of barurj, or spirits of the dead. The exact relationship of mir to barurj is vague, and no one will give a definite answer about it. The impression seems to be that the mir becomes a barurj in Anmel, but if one presses the question further the reply is invariably : " How do we know what goes on in Anmel ? " It is clear that the barurj are not allies of the living. They have no concern for the welfare of the living. If not intent on evil they at least have the power to wreak it, and are thus to be feared, though not propitiated, for there is no way known of doing this. The only way of coping with their threat is simply to avoid going where one is likely to meet them, for although some believe that these spirits</page><page sequence="13">22 THE DALY RIVER TRIBES never leave Antnel, others believe that they do, and that one may meet them in lonely places, in night shadows, or in unfamiliar country. All of these are shunned. The spirits of the dead inspire paralyzing fear in the more credulous, and a chilly unease even in the stronger- minded. A few natives have armed themselves rather pitifully with attempted disbelief, but the fear still keeps its grip. No one in waking life is supposed ever to have seen a barurj, although some think that under favourable conditions they might be seen. Most natives say, however, that these spirits are invisible, but that they appear to them in dreams, when they assume a grotesque, repulsive man-like form. Sleepers waking screaming out of baruy-ridden dreams cause many night alarms in the camp. The Nangiomeri people their spirit-world both with barurj (N. agutf) and with adida, a malevolent spirit which preys on the uncovered bodies of the dead. Adida are also invisible to waking eyes, but may be seen during sleep. They also are anthropomorphic. Mulluk Mulluk and Madngella appear to have no counterpart to the arjutf, whose history goes back into the mythological past of the Nangiomeri, whereas the entire mythology of the former tribes has perished. Thoughts of death and of the dead are never far from the Daly native. Camp conversation often turns in this direction. It is never difficult to start a native on a train of thought which ends in talk of death, unless there is distrust of the questioner. This preoccupation with death amounts almost to an obsession, and seems definitely touched with morbidity. There is much in the systems of belief and in the social environment to explain the bias. Life is filled with the constant threat of harm from barurj and adida, and also from an even more terrifying source - the mamakpik, the stealer of kidney fat. A short examination of the beliefs concerned with death and with the mamakpik will further illustrate this trend of thought. Death is regarded as both natural and unnatural. As in most Australian tribes the death of an infant, a young child, or an aged person, is regarded as completely natural. So is a death which supervenes on certain types of sickness. Where, for example, the decline is slow and apparent to everyone, and unattended by any</page><page sequence="14">THE DALY RIVER TRIBES 23 suspicious circumstance, no further explanation of death is needed. The heart is sometimes said to have rotted or become too hot (of which coughing, blood-spitting, sweats and feverishness are thought to be symptoms) and so to have caused death. There is then no suspicion of anything amiss. But deaths after sudden, inexplicable illness ; deaths by unexpected spearings in times of peace ; deaths by strange accidents, by snake-bite, by alligator attack, immediately arouse suspicion, and the possibility of human malpractice, with occult aid, occurs to everyone. This may have been (a) mawia, the secret administration of poison ; (b) palar/ur, the privy burning of the deceased's excrement, nail-clippings, clothing, or any intimate possession ; (c) most dreaded of all, the mamakpik, called in pidgin " the devil doctor." In their impact on social life mawia and palarjur are of completely subordinate importance to mamakpik. The occult element in each is roughly proportionate to their social importance. In mamakpik and palarjur the inner principle is much the same - evil-intentioned secret manipulation of malign super- natural forces by someone who understands how to control and direct them. No one admits that he possesses this knowledge, though freely attributing it to other tribes. It is difficult to give an exact account of mawia. No native poison can be obtained, and it is said always to have come from distant countries. The native does not seek an explanation of the working of mamakpik and palarjur in the face of unmistakable evidence of the scores of deaths that they have worked. Their validity is absolute : if the method is known and carried out, the evil effect will follow. There is mythological sanction for and a mass of historical verification of this belief. On questioning, the native seems to stand midway between the idea of the secret acts, performed by someone who understands them, themselves producing the evil effect, and the idea of the acts releasing forces of evil which in turn produce the effect. It is difficult to exaggerate the terror the mamakpik inspires. It amounts to a mass neurosis which grips all the river. Few natives will walk alone out of the light and warmth of the campfires. None will face a night journey in the bush except with companions. Even in broad daylight no one likes to walk alone. None ventures into unfamiliar country, lonely tracts of bush, pockets in the hills, or far from customarv hunting: grounds.</page><page sequence="15">24 THE DALY RIVER TRIBES Night intensifies the terrors which fill the day, for darkness is the time most favoured by the mamakpik. Other tribesmen visiting the river are never at ease, nor is any native even a few miles from his familiar haunts. Elaborate care is taken to protect camps from stealthy night attack. Screens of dry, crackling bushes, and even wire-netting, are used. Every camp has its watch dogs. Many dirawur are hidden deep in patches of jungle. In such an atmosphere suspicion at death is easily aroused. There are said to be clear symptoms of mawia and palatjur. It is mamakpik which needs elaborate detection. It cannot be diagnosed with certainty before death, even though everyone feels moral certainty that mamakpik has been responsible. Certainty is established by mystic divination after death, in which vocal appeal is made to the mir of the dead to indicate the murderer. The closest relatives of the dead usually make the appeal. The involved ritual of divination follows the common Australian pattern of searching for marks on the grave, attributing them to the mir, and regarding them as confirmation of the suspicions held. The Daly method of divination often enables the identity of the mamakpik to be established, whether he worked alone or in company, and from what direction he came. Other methods of divination are known and were once practised, but have dropped into disuse. There are many complexities of divination, and of mamakpik s methods which cannot be entered into here. The most impressive function of divination is to give a complete and satisfactory explanation of deaths which are felt to be unnatural and which would otherwise remain an intolerable mystery, causing serious disquiet. Divination may do little more than give occult seal to suspicion already held, but the native mentality expects, awaits, and is attuned to such guilt-fixation by verdict of the mir. It was formerly the practice to avenge the dead when the mir had spoken. This is no longer possible, owing to police supervision, but isolated acts of vengeance do occur. Failure to avenge does not appear to affect the welfare or the status of the dead in Anmel, but it does induce un sentiment d'incompletude in the living, which makes its contribution to the general loss of vital tone in their lives. No tribe admits to the possession of mamakpik. To do so would be to invite both native attack and police investigation, for garbled and</page><page sequence="16">1 IS II «I* *ti w || tu k^ i</page><page sequence="17">¡a; I 31 c/i ^ ai Hl «I ai W ^ | ¡</page><page sequence="18">■8 Iti It* $ &lt;ó CO ^i sii e 5§ . «•* Sài si H •fi fi II •ì I</page><page sequence="19">THE DALY RIVER TRIBES.

During my stay a rumour spread that a policeman had threatened to shoot on sight anyone pointed out to him as a mamakpik. This caused great upset, and seriously interfered with my research. The danger to administration is the possibility through misunderstanding of confounding the mamakpik with the socially useful miumdakar, who might be called the medicine-man, but who is also referred to in pidgin as the " doctor blackfellow." To distinguish between the two, a native talking in pidgin calls the mamakpik the " devil doctor," but I should not think any local white understands the difference. I feel sure that no river tribe possesses a professed mamakpik, and only one miumdakar exists among all the tribes. And he is only " a little bit " miumdakar. A man becomes a miumdakar by associating in dreams with the spirits of the dead. He has no potency against mamakpik, but is able by rubbing and touching to cure certain bodily ills. He fills a social role of great value, much influence, and some profit. But he holds it precariously, and loses his power once he stops dreaming of the spirits of the departed. In keeping with the widespread belief that evil, danger and immorality all reach their maxima in distant tribes, all existing sorcerers are said to come from a long way away. Most river tribes agree that the Berinken possess a great many sorcerers, which though almost certainly untrue is not unpleasing to the Moiil, Nangor and Marithiel, who nevertheless make much public show of denying it. The motive for the theft of kidney fat, though belief about it is somewhat muddled, is more readily understood than the place of kidney fat in the native theory of physiology. No special bodily function can be discovered for it except the important one of being essential to life. Combined with red ochre, itself of great ritual value, kidney fat can heal and give better health if applied to the body. The Nangiomeri believe that the kidney fat, hidden in the banks of watering places, is an irresistible attraction to fish, animals and birds, which will never then leave the country. Thus, continuity of food supply is assured in the country to which the mamakpik takes his</page><page sequence="23">26 THE DALY RIVER TRIBES prize. The genius of the mamakpik is that he leaves no scar or wound on his victim, being able to heal the incision by magic. For this reason several clumsy amateurs were soundly ridiculed for leaving gaping wounds in their victims. River tribes now bury their dead in the ground, but the Marithiel still practise tree-burial, which was once universal. Mulluk Mulluk and Madngella formerly burned the remains after one form of divination, and then buried the ashes. The head was often buried separately. The bones of a dead person who dies in another country are sometimes brought back for burial, and are often carried for months until an opportunity arises. Soon after death the possessions of the dead person are burned, and the ashes buried in or near the grave. If the death has taken place in the absence of a close relative he or she hurriedly returns, and according to the custom of lamlama hurls a spear at or beats another relative who was present at the death. Burial itself is not associated with any ritual except endless wailing, although McKillop reports that it once was.6 Final rites (tfarpurit) are carried out months or years after burial. If death has been due to sorcery, revenge must have been carried out in the interval. Yarpurit food and gifts are placed on the grave, a feast follows, and every trace of the grave is then obliterated. The dead person is thus finally ushered out of the world of the living. The prohibition on the use of his name is now lifted. Mention has already been made of the entire disappearance of Mulluk Mulluk and Madngella mythology. Nangiomeri and Marithiel are quickly losing theirs, but I was able to record in text form a number of their tales. The Theory of Sex. The native theory of sex is not easily obtained. With most river natives serious discussion of sexual beliefs is nearly impossible. This is a specific product of the culture contact, although there is a conventional rein upon such discussion. The English word " shame " has a surprising currency among a number of tribes, nearly always used in a sexual context. In every native language spoken on the river there is a term (Mulluk Mulluk yim) which is used in a very generalized way to denote embarrassment *Op. tit. p. 259.</page><page sequence="24">THE DALY RIVER TRIBES 27 confusion, or shame. A man is yim in the presence of strangers. He is yim when his wife's mother's name is mentioned. He is yim when he is ridiculed and made angry. He is yim at coarse talk by whites of his sexual association with his wife. But the specific idea of shame in respect to sexuality has become attached to the general concept of yim in a way which, I think, is foreign to its original use. So that now in conversation with whites shame, or yim, means primarily sexual shame. Among themselves (particularly the bush tribes which visit the Daly river) there is no sense of shame at sight of another's nakedness. The avoidances, of course, which hold in ordinary social intercourse make it unthinkable that a man should look, e.g. y at his wife's mother if she were naked. Few river natives now ever are naked, but I have seen grown men stand naked before women without the least shame, and among bush tribes, women before men. Much of the guilty sense of shame felt at the mention of sexual matters and at the uncovering of the sexual organs has been learned from whites, or else is assumed for their benefit. European clothes are thus a valued possession, for both men and women have become sensitive about appearing without clothes before whites. Of course, clothes are wanted for other reasons also. Thus, the native theory of sex is not learned without difficulty, even from men. Conditions on the river make it impossible to use women as informants. It is clear, however, that two theories of sex exist side by side : (a) a mystical theory of the type commonly found in Australian cultures, and (b) a barely understood, confused version of orthodox theory learned from whites. The emphasis in belief ranges from tribes like the Mulluk Mulluk and Madngella, which have completely forgotten their own mystical theory (which undoubtedly existed) to bush tribes with only the most imperfect knowledge of white beliefs. In tribes (like the Marithiel) where the beliefs co-exist in some definite form, the framing of the question governs the answer one receives. According to the Nangiomeri, mambir, or spirit children, enter a woman with certain types of food, or while she is bathing, or crossing a stream. Mambir originally came out of a rock from which a spring gushed in dream-times, and now are to be found in all permanent water. They sometimes invest trees, but always stay near water and near women. Old people cc</page><page sequence="25">28 THE DALY RIVER TRIBES sometimes see them, but never young people. An interesting distinction is drawn between (i) a child's father, i.e., the social father, or husband of the child's mother, and (2) the man who " finds " the child, i.e., finds and gives to the woman the food considered to be responsible for her pregnancy. Many men can thus point out children whom they " found," but who have other " fathers." The distinction approximates to that between genitor and pater. In the pure native theory the sexual act seems to have mostly an erotic significance, but in the altered belief it is considered to be in some way concerned with pregnancy. How or why is not known. Many natives think that mambir will not enter a woman who has had too much sexual association with white men, and they attribute to this the fact that so few women now have children. There has been, and still is, a great deal of sexual association of white men and black women. This is not actively resented, and by some tribes is even invited. Resentment only arises when whites or Chinese refuse or forget to pay satisfactorily with food, tea, sugar, and tobacco for the services of the woman, or prevent the woman from returning to her camp when she wishes to return, or when her superordinate relatives tell her to return. In all river tribes there are definite social mechanisms (such as madarma, which permits a man to improve his economic position by prostituting his wife) which facilitate such intercourse with white men. The Marithiel and Moiil offer their women with great freedom. Conclusion. This report has made brief mention of certain phases of the acute culture contact which is taking place on the Daly river. Its history has been roughly outlined. Some of its conse- quences for the native societies have been indicated, but the full story has not been told. In a later paper the problem will be dealt with to the full extent of the material available. My study of the sociology of Daly River tribes is not yet completed, and I hope to return to the field in 1934 to continue the research. For this reason the report has not given to a number of aspects of the culture-contact situation on the Daly River the attention which, in my opinion, is merited by their significance for native administration in North Australia. Such additional comment</page><page sequence="26">THE DALY RIVER TRIBES 29 as may be necessary will be more conclusive and thus more valuable at the completion of the inquiries commenced in 1932. In concluding this report, I desire to express my gratitude to the Australian National Research Council for its liberal endowment of my research, and to its executive officers for their kindness and consideration. My thanks are due particularly to Dr. H. G. Chapman, Hon. Treasurer, and to Mr. A. Gibson, Hon. Secretary. I must acknowledge, also, my indebtedness to Professor A. R. Radcliffe- Brown, Dr. Raymond Firth, and Dr. A. P. Elkin for their encourage- ment of and interest in my work. Dr. Elkin's kindly criticism of this report has been especially helpful. W. E. H.
