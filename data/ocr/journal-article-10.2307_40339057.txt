We begin by considering the ethical con- cerns arising from the uneasiness some appreciators might feel when expe- riencing topiary as a manipulation or contortion of natural processes. We then turn to ways in which topiary might cause an 'aesthetic affront' through the humanizing effects of sentimentality and falsification of nature (most often found in representational rather than abstract topiary). Our conten- tion is that successful topiary emerges through a dynamic and positive relationship between topiarist and tree, where the gardener works with nature's forms instead of in strong opposition to them. Appreciation of successful topiary, we shall argue, is marked by an experience of both the tree as a living thing and the artifice which has shaped it. WHAT IS TOPIARY? Topiary is the practice, or some say, art, of trimming, pruning, and training trees and other plants into ornamental shapes. Topiarists use plants that have growing rates and textures suited to coaxing them into particu- lar shapes and maintaining the shapes over time with pruning. Typical topiary plants are privet and boxwood because of their dense texture, and ETHICS &amp;THE ENVIRONMENT, 8(1) 2003 ISSN: 1085-6633 Â©Indiana University Press All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.

Cy- press was favored by the earliest topiarists in ancient Rome, and it is used in present day in warmer climates. One's choice of plant and particular specimen depends on many factors, including what shape one wants to create and how quickly one wants a result. Creation and maintenance of the shapes is achieved through the use of wires, twine, stakes, and of course, trimming and pruning. There are different kinds of topiary and many different examples of possible shapes. This paper focuses on traditional topiary gardens, collec- tions of growing trees that are maintained through trimming and pruning, and trees with some history. Our own experience, and many of the ex- amples below, come mainly from one of the largest and oldest topiary gardens, at Levens Hall, just north of Lancaster in England. The Levens topiary garden was begun by Beaumont in 1689, and many of the original trees still exist. Topiary also includes knot gardens, espalier (training plants into flat, two-dimensional surfaces), and the architectural topiary of hedges formed into walls, windows, arches, mazes, green rooms, arcades, and columns. Besides these types of gardens, more recently, people have be- come interested in tabletop or portable topiary, which is created with frames and is more of an object for decoration rather than existing within a gar- den setting. The fast food of topiary is mock topiary, which is much more like a sculpture in that its materials, glued together branches, moss, and so on, are no longer growing. We make a distinction in the paper between abstract and representa- tional topiary. As with this distinction more generally, there is no sharp divide between the two, but there are clear cases of each type. Among abstract topiary there are the severe geometrical forms of formal gardens - pyramids, squares and balls - and the more free-form spirals, rings or hoops, cloud-shapes, and judge's wigs. On the representational side we find, more traditionally, peacocks, jugs, chairs and tables, hunting scenes, fleets of ships, battle scenes, and more recently all sorts of animals including gi- raffes, teddy bears, trains, and even Disney characters.1 These days, topi- ary appears in all sorts of forms. Yi-Fu Tuan reports that a couple of California residents even created topiary hedges in the form of male sex organs, much to the dismay of their neighbors!2 Ethical Considerations Before embarking on an aesthetic critique and potential justification 128 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 8(1) 2003</page><page sequence="4">of topiary, we would like to engage with some ethical concerns. There are three broad areas where concerns about topiary as a manipulation of na- ture could arise. Harming living things, harming ourselves, and unfortu- nate cultural resonances. The first question we might ask is, does topiary harm the tree? The image of a living thing that has been contorted from its natural form or constrained can prompt feelings of disquiet in the observer about how it is for the tree. The idea that it somehow hurts the tree - that the tree is in pain - can be discounted, but there could still be a realistic concept of harm that is harder to set aside. The tree cannot feel pain because it has no central nervous system - when we attribute pain to the tree we are ex- pressing sympathy not empathy - we imagine what it would be like for us to be held in that way, to be constricted in our movements and forced to bend to another's will. However, if we do empathize with the tree - if we base our perception on how it is for a tree to be shaped - the picture is less clear. While there is not, in Thomas Nagel's terminology, "something that it is like to be a tree"3 and a tree is not, in Tom Regan's terminology, "the subject of a life,"4 it is still a living thing and as such is goal directed. For the tree there can be no subjective experiencing of being topiaried or hav- ing a goal thwarted. The remaining ethical problem is whether it is permis- sible to hinder a tree's goal. We could just invoke a guilt by association move and claim that if topiary is ethically wrong then so is hedging, up- rooting ash seedlings between paving stones, and even treating fungal in- fections, to show that this leads to absurd consequences. However, a critic could still claim that topiary for no purpose other than ornamentation is a separate issue. The only conflicting interest in the topiary case that pre- vents the tree reaching its goal is the whim of the topiarist and whims should not override the goal directed behavior of living things. The remaining defense here is to point out that a plant's goal-directed behavior is towards thriving; its various systems are geared towards pro- viding its needs and the intervention of pruning and shaping works along- side these needs. A tree will always be shaped to a certain extent by its environment: the nutrients available, the prevailing wind and so on. Ad- mittedly, it takes human intervention to shape it as a cube, but it can still thrive in that environment. The topiarist's concern is not just for a tree that looks like a cube, but one that is still a living, thriving tree. The result- ing tree no longer looks like one of its species as depicted in a field guide, but then neither would one that germinated next to a wall or under dense ISIS BROOK AND EMILY BRADY TOPIARY 129</page><page sequence="5">tree cover. In managing the environment so that the tree thrives the topiarist has an important goal of the tree at heart. A second area of ethical concern is about what effect topiary might have on us as moral beings. This could take two forms: intervening with living things in this way somehow desensitizes us to the harming of other organisms who may be subjects of a life and/or it makes us look at nature as something to be managed always for our own benefit. As established above, pruning does not hurt a tree, but perhaps overriding the feeling that it does and going ahead with it or admiring its products somehow makes us insensitive to hurting animals. This claim is a little like Kant's injunc- tion not to be cruel to animals so as to develop the right sensibilities to- wards humans,5 except that in this case we are treating something that cannot feel pain as if it could in order to train ourselves to not mistreat organisms that do feel pain. Kant's idea could lead to the right action even if it was for the wrong reasons, although he has been criticized for making this claim with no psychological evidence. However, in the plant/human version it seems completely unreasonable. Understanding the distinction between organisms that are the subjects of a life, who know their interests and expe- rience pain, and ones that do not is an essential part of knowing how to behave towards both. Clouding the issue with anthropomorphisms does not help us to discover their distinctive needs or treat them well. Pruning a tree into a pyramid and docking a puppy's tail are both done for appearances; the important distinction to be made is that the puppy is hurt by the action. Even though we do not learn to treat one thing well by misapplying our sensibilities to something else, the things we see and learn to enjoy could shape our view of the world such that we cannot appreciate differ- ent experiences. In this case the person committed to topiary as an art form in the context of gardening cannot help but see natural environments as 'hopelessly messy' and 'in need of a good prune.' As long as they are not let loose perhaps this is not a problem. However, increasingly the appre- ciation of wild nature is seen as morally improving and the human desire to manage and organize nature as a defect of character. A topiary garden as a symbol of human control could thus be seen as emblematic of our errors that have brought about environmental degradation. To want to maintain and continue such practices is surely wrong. Again, this claim rests on an assumption that people do not make informed distinctions. The person who appreciates a fine example of topiary might be equally 130 ETHICS b THE ENVIRONMENT, 8(1) 2003</page><page sequence="6">able to identify and appreciate a flourishing natural ecosystem. Admit- tedly there is a tendency to focus on the things that interest us. Anyone who collects firewood will have experienced the tendency to notice dead branches even when walking in the woods for pleasure; our instrumental interests can intrude and so can our particular aesthetic interests. But that tendency does not mean that we are inherently unable to appreciate differ- ent things or likely to see all of nature as malleable. Interestingly, today the purpose of topiary is often to create a juxtapo- sition between the formal structure of the garden and the more informal planting of mixed herbaceous areas. The juxtaposition enhances the infor- mality of the other planting, so far from creating a strict order, its purpose is to emphasize the mixture of natural forms that are increasingly chosen using ecological principles to establish plant communities. The third area of ethical disquiet, the unfortunate cultural resonances of topiary, is a complex one that will need some detailed explanation; it could be seen as a deeper look into that second realm of harming our- selves. Possibly the first thing that springs to mind with regard to unfortu- nate cultural resonances is the social order that prevailed in the period of topiary's heyday. For the English garden this could be marked by the es- tablishment of the topiary garden at Levens in the 17th century. The elabo- rate gardens of the period were only able to be maintained because of the cheapness of the labor. Of course the same criticism is made of elaborate gardens of all styles at least until 1914, when everything changed. The informal herbaceous borders of Gertrude Jekyll, the Victorian love of an- nual bedding plants, and the passion for exotics, all made gardens labor intensive and a luxury to be enjoyed by the rich out of the labor of the poor. We could even go further back to the origins of the term topiary in ancient Rome. The topia was the ornamental garden of a villa and the topiarius was the slave entrusted specifically with its care.6 Criticisms of this kind can, we think, be discounted. Contemporary labor intensive gar- dens are either managed by reasonably paid gardeners or are the leisure pursuit of their owners or volunteers. In a sense the exploitation of the past is overwritten by contemporary enthusiasm. Also, a criticism of topi- ary on this basis would entail a criticism of many revered architectural feats, such as those in Venice. However, there is a more taxing problem, and it is one that connects to the previous problem of how ordered nature could shape our percep- ISIS BROOK AND EMILY BRADY TOPIARY 131</page><page sequence="7">tions. To explain this we need a somewhat more detailed examination of historical currents. Positioning topiary within a particular worldview, we could see it as emblematic of a particular approach to nature. To see this clearly we need to move beyond topiary itself to the land- scape design of Italian Renaissance villas. The kind of design principles that dictated the way villas were sited within the topography and the lay- out of the gardens were developed from an idea of art revealing the hidden order in nature. Far from a simple binary opposition of chaotic nature and human endeavors imposing an order upon the chaos of matter, the idea was to bring out the inherent order that was there, but hidden from our view. And the order of nature thus revealed was geometrical. The genesis of the Renaissance designers' ideas was Plotinus (c.205-270) who saw human rea- son as the means by which we can both see the reality of nature hidden under the appearance of things and mold it to bring it into a more apparent harmony. In the 15th century this idea of the mathematical interpretation of nature became an artistic concept. The key idea within this was the propor- tions of the human body as the most perfect embodiment of the harmonies of the universe.7 So not only was nature to be understood mathematically, that is, through a human construct, but design should use the proportions of the human body as the most perfect expression of that mathematical order. This staggering expression of hubris sits rather uncomfortably with the contemporary consciousness of human destruction of the natural world. Our claim here is that the unfortunate cultural resonances run sym- bolically deeper than reflections on the working conditions of the garden- ers. It places topiary as quintessentially about human control. This was human control to make the tree not just as we would have liked it to be, but as we thought it should be. The design of the garden and the treatment of plants within it could be seen, and certainly were seen, as a project to return nature to its condition before the fall. We are not suggesting that these historical ideas are foremost in the consciousness of people enjoying topiary, even topiary in an accurate re- construction of the period, but these gardens were created in part to tell us about who we are and the position of the human being in the order of nature. If they worked at the time they surely have some subtle effect on us now. Perhaps we are sensitive to the message behind the medium even when it is transformed and overlaid with later cultural resonances. Although we have fully addressed some of the ethical qualms about 132 ETHICS fy THE ENVIRONMENT, 8(1) 2003</page><page sequence="8">this type of manipulation of living trees, the disquieting thought remains that we could be influenced by an unhealthy notion of our role in the 'perfection' of nature. We would of course be talking about rather subtle influences here and the public understanding of these trends and influences should never be underestimated. For many, the historical dimension of garden design, the stories that these features tell, are well known and un- derstood as historical - we enjoy the forms and wonder at the hubris in the same glance. However, in moving to questions of the aesthetic apprecia- tion of topiary we propose that it is necessary to carry forward that disqui- eting thought and use it as a factor in making judgments about the nature of the aesthetic appreciation and about good and bad topiary. Aesthetic Considerations The shaping and appreciation of topiary presents an interesting prob- lem for aesthetics in the environment. As a gardening practice, topiary brings together both artifice and natural processes, and in many forms of topiary, especially representational forms, human artistic intentions and ideas are strongly imposed onto nature. The synthesis of independent com- ponents, artificial and natural, makes aesthetic appreciation of topiary quite distinctive, like other kinds of phenomena that lie between nature and art.8 However, while some people may be captivated and charmed by trees formed into squirrels and top hats, the aesthetic reaction of others may involve a mixture of pleasure and uneasiness. Mara Miller captures one dimension of the problem when she objects to the "disregard for the plant materials evidenced ... in the geometric shapes forced upon plants in formal gardens and topiary, where the natural shapes of the vegetation are destroyed to suit the designer's conception, rather than exploited in a dy- namic interaction between plan and plant."9 All of this suggests a set of aesthetic problems connected to potential types of conflict that arise be- tween art and nature or humans and nature through acts of forming and appreciating topiary. It is possible, we shall argue, that some topiary expresses a positive, dynamic interrelationship between humans and nature. Donald Crawford has discussed the very interesting concept of the dialectical relationship between art and nature, where two potentially conflicting forces resolve themselves into a third form that represents a more harmonious relation- ship.10 Crawford puts it this way: ISIS BROOK AND EMILY BRADY TOPIARY 133</page><page sequence="9">in a dialectical relationship the two elements of the relationship are conflicting forces whose interaction brings into being some third ob- ject - the product of their interaction. The emergent third object may become a new object of aesthetic appreciation, one which results from the synthesis of opposing forces, artifactual and natural.11 Topiary and other phenomena like it, for example, some types of Japanese gardens, bonsai, turf works and other kinds of living sculpture, and some environmental artworks, may present a dialectical relationship between art and nature.12 Applying Crawford's concept to topiary, the dialectical relationship may be said to exist between the tree and the topiarist as sculp- tor. The relationship, which is not so much one of conflict as a difference between a natural process and an act of artifice, potentially resolves itself through a dynamic interaction between gardener and tree. Before explain- ing how this might work, we need to look at cases where a relationship of negative conflict exists. aesthetic affronts to nature As we have argued, topiary is not necessarily ethically harmful either to nature or to ourselves, but it is important to distinguish between appro- priate and inappropriate aesthetic approaches to topiary. Several writers in environmental aesthetics have sought to capture inappropriate aesthetic treatment of nature.13 Allen Carlson offers a particularly helpful idea for our purposes in his discussion of an 'aesthetic affront' to nature.14 An aes- thetic affront occurs when an aesthetic imposition or indignity is made upon nature. These offenses are aesthetic rather than moral because they are "generated by the aesthetic qualities of the object, rather than by, for example, its social, moral, ecological, or other such qualities."15 Carlson is concerned in particular with aesthetic affronts caused by some works of environmental art. For example, works of environmental art by Michael Heizer alter the landscape by cutting grand forms into it, thereby forcibly imposing human actions onto nature.16 Not all environmental art is open to this type of criticism. The nature of the artwork itself, its sensitivity to its natural/environmental setting or site, as well as the intentions of the artist, may all be factors that determine whether or not it is an aesthetic affront.17 There is a sense in which topiary imposes its artifactuality on nature (and also a sense in which it can be a type of environmental art - a ques- tion that we have to set aside for now). But it is not the case that every imposition of artifactuality onto nature will cause an aesthetic affront. As 134 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 8(1) 2003</page><page sequence="10">we have suggested, topiary is potentially a form of gardening that works dynamically with nature, moving closer to it, rather than away from it and against it. Also, in the garden, topiary works within a particular context where artifactuality is already present in our actions in relation to that type of environment. However, there remain some topiary practices that could be seen to cause an aesthetic affront. One problematic practice lies in the particular shapes and forms that the gardener fashions. Some representational topi- ary, such as topiary animals, set out to imitate animal and other shapes, which in many cases manipulate nature for the sole purpose of entertain- ing humans. These forms are much further away from nature's own forms than some abstract topiary, such as clouds and imperfect, less severe shapes. The aim of some representational topiary is not to work dynamically with nature's forms, or to draw attention to them, but rather to point beyond nature to a human-centered world.18 Although representation is a common aim in art, gardens constitute a practice that involves working directly with nature. Some garden prac- tices, such as picturesque gardens, place value on nature only insofar as it meets a standard of art, but others do not, and may adopt an appropriate attitude toward nature in terms of the aesthetic choices made by the gar- dener. In our view, most representational topiary does not encourage such an attitude, and instead, constitutes the imposition of a human view onto nature through aesthetic means. trivializing nature The humanizing tendency of some representational topiary leads to a falsification of nature. Ronald Hepburn has offered some interesting ideas on this, pointing to a trivializing approach as one that "distorts, ignores, suppresses truth about [nature's] . . . objects, feels and thinks about them in ways that falsify how nature really is."19 Although his examples are directed at more natural environments rather than gardens, we can apply his ideas here to address the relationship between nature and humans in the garden. There are different ways in which trivializing might occur, and understanding them helps to identify the problem with representational topiary. sentimentalizing nature Hepburn argues that sentimentalizing nature falsifies nature because ISIS BROOK AND EMILY BRADY TOPIARY 135</page><page sequence="11">it "falsely posits human feelings and human attitudes in the non-human - or more likely posits failed human life and human attitudes instead of successfully attained non-human life."20 Anthropomorphism is usually dis- cussed in the context of projecting human ways of being - emotions, expe- riences - onto other living species, mainly other mammals, but it has an interesting application to representational topiary. We are made to see a natural organism as another form, a thing that it is not, by projecting another form onto it. This sentimentalizing takes place also when we take a too limited or narrow view of nature, and may take the form of appreci- ating nature only from one point of view or by misperceiving it altogether. Fantastic representational topiary is a case of this because it fails to cap- ture the natural aspect of the tree in any appropriate sense, that is, in a way that is responsive to the tree as a growing, thriving thing. It imposes one way, a fanciful human way, of conceiving of a tree. (This is not to deny that nature can be fanciful in at least a metaphorical sense; but then nature does not impose its 'fancifulness' on other things.) Not all anthropomorphic responses are bad, but we need to be criti- cally aware when we respond in this way to nature. Gardens are cultural landscapes, a sort of quasi-nature, insofar as they involve intentionality, but some representational topiary goes too far, leaving the tree behind, as it were. It is much further away from the truth of the tree than other forms of topiary. In a sense we could say that in the way that anthropomorphiz- ing tries to make non-human living things into human kinds of things, some representational topiary tries to make trees into art. But the aim of topiary ought to be to bring out the interrelationship between humans and nature, not to simply create an artefact on the one hand, or allow nature to take its own course, on the other. Making topiary into an artefact commits a category mistake in the garden setting. The category of kitsch arises too in the context of representational topiary. Kitsch has been defined as two opposing or very unlike things or qualities brought together in a single medium. It has also been criticized by Gordon Beam, "for being too easy, for being too formulaic, and for being a lie."21 Objects we may be inclined to call kitsch, "Muzak, Eiffel tower pepper grinders, ice cubes shaped like breasts" and so on, may be enjoyed by some, but in art criticism, kitsch is usually defined as a negative aes- thetic category, and in bad taste.22 Examples of kitsch topiary might be Disney characters or trains, where a tree is made into something entirely different from itself, and where two mediums come together inappropri- 136 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 8(1) 2003</page><page sequence="12">ately, causing a deep aesthetic conflict. This conflict arises because the topiarist ignores the natural qualities of the tree and simply uses it as sculpt- ing material, rather than trying to work with the tree and respond to it as a natural entity in the aesthetic choices that are made. Working toward rather than against positive interaction between topiarist and tree may have important implications for appreciation. Aesthetically good topiary enables the viewer to see and appreciate the tree and its own qualities, in contrast to bad topiary which negates or hides them. Imagination and Whimsy In appreciating gardens, we understand the role of human creativity in them, and we appreciate it as part of the complexity of their value. Along with this comes the valuing of imagination in the garden. Imagination most often shows itself in garden design, for example, how gardeners seek to evoke imagination through 'invitation', in the way they design paths, pros- pects, and by presenting us with phenomena and designs to explore through imagination and the senses.23 Topiarists also use imagination as they prune and sculpt trees. Repre- sentational topiary represents a strong use of imagination in so far as it tries to get us to see a tree as a train, a squirrel, or whatever. Imagination can, however, overstep its limits. In the context of the artworld, we en- courage creative imagination to spread its wings, but when humans are working more directly with nature, as in environmental art or gardens, imagination ought to be directed in ways that work positively with nature's forms. Whimsy is an aesthetic category which points to qualities of playful- ness, joy, and humor. This quality can be found in art works but also in gardens, and especially in topiary. Whimsical qualities are not necessarily objectionable, but overly whimsical representational topiary overly hu- manizes nature, making gardens into theme parks, and upsetting the har- mony that gardens create between humans and nature. Topiary squirrels and trains are too whimsical. They are in bad taste, and as such they also constitute a kind of aesthetic disrespect for nature. There may, however, be cases of abstract topiary that are whimsical without being in bad taste. Here, we have in mind a particular bush at Levens, a small, abstract dome shape with a short, delicate trunk growing up, topped by a tiny ball of leaves.24 The gardener at Levens improvised the tiny ball shape from the trunk that kept growing up. Rather than cut it off, he responded to the ISIS BROOK AND EMILY BRADY TOPIARY 137</page><page sequence="13">pattern of growth and shaped a second element on the top of the bush. The dome shape alone would be a typical abstract topiary bush, but with the addition of the tiny ball on top, the effect is light and playful. Topiary and a Positive Relationship between Humans and Nature Now we would like to bring some of these criticisms together to help us to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful topiary within the aesthetic context of topiary practice and appreciation. This is not an easy distinction to make. First, it helps to experience the cases we discuss first- hand, or at least to view a picture of each in order to understand why they may be in good or bad taste. Second, the distinctions are not always clear- cut, and not all cases are straightforwardly categorized as problematic or unproblematic. The best course is a case-by-case approach, but we also try to show how, generally, abstract topiary is less objectionable on aesthetic grounds. Problematic representational topiary includes cases where the aesthetic aims and actions of the topiarist create a human imposition on nature or trivialize nature. These are frivolous pieces that move in only one direction in respect of the relationship between humans and nature. Trains, Disney characters, teddy bears and such-like, move toward artifactuality and in- tentionality rather than revealing or encouraging an interrelationship be- tween topiarist and natural processes. Some topiary that falls into a gray area between the abstract and the representational may constitute success- ful cases, especially cases of imperfect forms. Here we have in mind the 'judge's wig' topiary and the 'top hat' topiary from Levens Hall. These are traditional topiary forms in which one can identify a representational shape, but they are abstract enough to express more of the tree's shape than other more explicitly representational forms. Within the category of abstract topiary, we find objectionable attempts to impose onto nature aesthetic qualities found in perfect geometrical forms rather than to work more with nature in an interplay that expresses a dynamic relationship. Examples of problematic abstract topiary include the rigid symmetrical forms of conventional topiary such as pyramids, cubes, and so on, commonly found in formal gardens. Successful abstract topiary is wide-ranging, and it is typified by the topiarist working with nature's forms, allowing the tree to play a central role, and where the individual improvises upon natural material. In some cases, these forms have their origins in outgrown geometrical shapes. For example, some of the abstract 138 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 8(1) 2003</page><page sequence="14">topiary trees in the Levens Hall garden, which are very old, have taken on a life of their own. The result is less severe shapes which the gardener responds to in his choices about how to prune these trees. This kind of topiary feels much less contrived and artificial, although it is still a product of the garden. Examples here include: ring topiary, a series of rings or hoops formed by yew branches, one on top of each other, revealing the complex intertwining of branches within the tree; clouds, great abstract masses of privet or yew lying close to the ground and forming various asymmetrical rounded shapes, reminiscent of clouds; perhaps the small Levens' dome with the tiny ball top; and other imperfect or less ordered abstract forms. In respect of abstract topiary, more conventional topiarists might be able to learn from contemporary garden movements, while at the same time maintaining their styles and tradition. Paul Cooper has written a fas- cinating book about the various forms of 'living scultpure', including the gardens of Pearl Fryar.25 Fryar taught himself how to sculpt trees and had no previous experience of topiary. His style could be described as inventive but free-form, allowing the existing shape of the tree to direct his work: "Pearl Fryar's topiary has been described as 'botanical sculpture', and his abstract creations certainly bear little resemblance to mainstream work. Sweeping curves, arches, and spirals lend them a dynamism rarely seen in conventional topiary."26 Indeed, it might be difficult to tell the difference between some of Fryar's topiary and natural trees themselves, if it weren't for the garden setting. We are not saying that good topiary is necessarily topiary that looks like nature. Topiary is a garden practice that involves humans shaping and modifying nature in explicit ways. However, it is possible to create topiary that is in good taste in so far as it seeks to express some distinctive quali- ties of natural forms. The Aesthetics of Imperfection We would like to conclude by suggesting a useful way to approach topiary as an aesthetic category. The aesthetics of topiary could be articu- lated as an 'aesthetics of imperfection', where imperfection is viewed as a positive aesthetic quality. This category has been used to describe the Japa- nese aesthetic taste for imperfection, humbleness, and natural forces, such as weathering and organic qualities, as opposed to showiness and flashi- ness.27 Another take on the aesthetics of imperfection has been put for- ISIS BROOK AND EMILY BRADY TOPIARY 139</page><page sequence="15">ward in the context of jazz music.28 Here, imperfection is associated with the freedom, creativity, and verve of improvisation. Most jazz improvisa- tion works with a standard jazz tune, and plays freely with it to bring out its qualities and form. In the context of topiary, we might consider it as an 'art' of imperfec- tion, where humans work with trees to create an object or environment that is expressive of something more dynamic, a creative relationship be- tween culture and nature. Our favorite ring topiary yew tree at Levens Hall illustrates this type of aesthetic. The head gardener, who regularly prunes and sculpts this tree, works with its natural form, improvising with nature's shapes, while his work is still directed very much by the organic processes of the tree as it continues to grow. The tree is two- or three- hundred years old, and it leans over from the weight of its age. The gar- dener works with this shape rather than seeking to correct it or force it into a more perfect form. As we see it, the best trajectory for traditional topiary practice would be to evolve by moving closer to nature, that is, to work more with natural processes rather than too harshly imposing hu- man order or human ideas onto it. 29 ENDNOTES 1.

This has been suggested by Carlson, applying Crawford's idea, in Carlson, 2000, 164-74. 13. See Carlson, 2000; Stan Godio vitch, "Offending Against Nature," Environ- mental Values (7): 1998; R.W.

Carlson follows Crawford's use of the concept in "Nature and Art: Some Dialectical Relationships." 15. Ibid. 16. Crawford cites some of Heizer's works as examples of a third type of dynamic relationship between nature and art, but one in which one side of the relation- ship dominates and even destroys the other. See Crawford, 1983, 51-52. 17. For further discussion of these issues see Carlson, 1986 and 2000; Crawford, 1983; Stephanie Ross, "Gardens, Earthworks, and Environmental Art," in Salim Kemal and Ivan Gasiceli, eds., Landscape, Natural Beauty and the Arts (Cam- bridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993), 158-82; and Emily Brady, "Rooted Art?: Environmental Art and Our Attachment to Nature," IO: Internet Jour- nal of Applied Aesthetics, Volume 1, 1998, http:/www.lpt.n7io/io98/brady.html. 18. Of course, animal topiary represents natural organisms, but our point is con- cerned more with the topiarist's relationship with the tree and its natural as- pects. 19. Hepburn, 69. 20.

Perhaps one could say that overly whimsical topiary lacks imagination in so far as appropriate imagination would be that which is guided by the aim of shap- ing topiary that reflects nature's forms rather than going against them in such a strong way. 25.

Yuriko Saito, "Japanese Aesthetics: Historical Overview," in Michael Kelly, ed., Encyclopedia of Aesthetics, Vol. 2 (Oxford and New York: Oxford Uni- versity Press, 1998), 547-50. There are other aspects of Japanese aesthetics that might be helpful in supporting our position concerning topiary as a gar- dening practice, such as the view that Japanese gardens seek to reveal the es- sential qualities of natural phenomena. However, there has been some debate and discussion about this apparent respect for nature in the garden setting, and it is too complex for us to be able to address here. See Yuriko Saito: "Japanese Gardens: The Art of Improving Nature," Chanoyu Quarterly: Tea and the Arts of Japan, 83, 1996 and "The Japanese Love of Nature: A Paradox," Land- scape, 31, 1992. 28.

We would like to thank Chris Crowder, Head Gardener at Levens Hall, Levens, England, for his practical knowledge and philosophical reflections on topiary practice, which we found most helpful for writing this paper. 142 ETHICS b THE ENVIRONMENT, 8(1) 2003</page></plain_text>
