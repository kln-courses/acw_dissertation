From the George Brown Collection: an anthropomorphic malanggan mask of the tatanua variety in wood and vegetable fibre with sea-snail opercula for eyes. Painted black, red and white. From Bismarck Archipelago - New Ireland. Collected by Brown some time between 1860-1908. The same mask is illustrated in his autobiography George Brown D.D. Pioneer Missionary and Explorer - An Autobiography (1908, p208), and in his Melanesians and Polynesians (1910, p238). Malanggan is the generic name for both memorial ceremonies for the dead in northern New Ireland and for various sculptured art objects made for these ceremonies. In addition, it is a scholarly term for a particular art style, used for particular styles of masks, dance ornaments, house decorations, and canoe ornaments. Malanggan ceremonials are always memorials or last rites for the dead, but as clans lose a member at death, it is at the same time a ceremony of recruitment for a new member and coincides with initiation of adolescent boys. Each ceremonial begins with a death. Kinsmen of the deceased person undertake the preparation for the many formal stages of malanggan by planting gardens of taro, sweet potatoes, and bananas for the many feasts and by arranging for purchases of pigs. The boy's father acts on behalf of the deceased persons from his wife's clan and also on behalf of his own son, who also belongs to his wife's clan, to fill the gap caused by the death. Relatives from both the father's clan and from that of his wife, son, and the relatives of the deceased, help him. The malanggan ceremonial objects are manufactured in the yard of the men's house where the father/patron lives, which is the most sacred place of the clan. The objects are displayed at the climax of the ceremony. The main types of malanggan art are: masks, large wooden heads, horizontal friezes, vertical figures to be planted in the ground, and huge vertical carvings. These may include figures of birds, animals, fish, lizards and cosmic symbols. The art varied from men's house to men's house, and from clan to clan. It makes symbolic reference to the particular deceased person being honoured, points public attention to the clans involved and expresses public concern with death and with replenishment by the up-coming young. Each object is made and used in sacred context. It is thought that about three- quarters of the New Ireland objects in the world's museums and private collections are of the malanggan type from the north. This mask was valued by the official valuer (see editorial) at ?16,000, and is one of the nineteen items from the George Brown Collection for which export licences were withheld by the Arts Minister, and for which public collections in the UK were invited to bid between 15 April and 11 July 1986. As no successful bids were made, this item is one of the eight to be released for export to the Osaka Museum. The eleven items of the Brown collection to remain in Britain went to: six valued at ?117,000 to the Sainsbury Centre, Norwich; one valued at ?19,000 to Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery; four valued at ?80,000 to the Museum of Mankind.
