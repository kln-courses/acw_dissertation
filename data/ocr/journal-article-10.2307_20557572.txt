<plain_text><page sequence="1">Brian John Derek Mahon's Letters from America Referring to his Selected Poems (1991), Derek Mahon once gave an interviewer blunt, if scrupulous, advice: "These are the poems that matter, you can forget all the rest."1 Because of Mahon's persistent practice of revising his work and his ruthless exclusion from Selected Poems of often familiar and much admired poems, readers may well wonder how many of the poems in his most recent vol ume, The Hudson Letter (1995), are likely to survive a future selection or edition of his work. The query is all the more legitimate as that volume, perhaps more than any previous Mahon volume, is particularly uneven and controversial. The issue is not one of form, in which brevity is sometimes mistaken for lack of se riousness. His "Burbles," versions of Samuel Beckett's "Mirlitonnades"2 and his versions of Ovid, Laforgue, and Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill are finely achieved, as might be expected from a past master of translation. Rather, the volume con tains examples of such lightweight forms as clerihews and "river rhymes,"3 at least one instance of slight, inconsequential verse ("The Old Bath-House In scription"), and the most extended work in the first part of the volume, "The Yaddo Letter"?a verse letter addressed to his son and daughter?is also the least successful. The verse-letter form is not original to Mahon. W. H.Auden, a long-stand ing exemplar, showed him the way in works like "New Year Letter" and "Letter to Lord Byron," particularly in technique, and, directed him to the poetry of Lord Byron for its fluent, conversational voice and language; as Auden declared in the manner of Byron's mock-epic, Don Juan, "I want a form that's large i.

The American publisher, William Rossa Cole, grandson of Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, invented the form of the river rhyme. "There must be a body of water, even a shore-line, named in the first line. It must be in meter, any meter, and it must rhyme. It can be any length, but is usually four lines, and it positively must have a joke, or word play, or some silliness in the last line."

Both are addressed to friends and fellow writers; both are substantial in scope and length, extending to 176 and 160 lines respectively; both employ an eight-line stanza, consisting of couplets with only occasional variation; and both combine the intimacy of the verse-letter form with more profound examination of self, society, and the human condition. The formal shape of the verse, achieved by way of the controlled stanza unit and rhyme scheme, provides a structure within which the poet*s more private ex pression may be communicated without declining into confessionalism.5 All this coincided with Mahon's own declared preference for form and formalism? that is, "In the sense that all poets are formalists;" Mahon "enjoys the sense of struggling against a form, and that provides the creative tension that tells me that this is a real poem that I'm writing."6 At the same time he insisted that com mitment to form does not exclude strong feeling: "this strong feeling is trans muted to such a degree that it is barely visible. Some of the poems may be too academic, too clever, to lack the force of real feeling, especially those that are meant to be funny." He also says, "I think I have a sort of reticence which makes me disguise feeling in cleverness, if indeed it is cleverness. Sometimes, however, I come right out with it and speak frankly." The problem in "The Yaddo Letter," is that feeling too often declines into sentimentality or self-pity, and the humor, with which Mahon has previously been deservedly credited, sounds forced. The New Yorker reportedly decided against publication on the grounds that the poem was "too personal,"7 but the objection surely had as much to do with tone as with feeling. The poem is a verse letter from the Yaddo Writers' Centre, Saratoga Springs, New York State; 4. W. H. Auden, "Letter to Lord Byron" (1936), Collected Poems, ed.

The tone, because ingratiating, goes embarrassingly astray: "Do you / still slam the goals in, Rory? Katie-coo, / how goes it with the piano and the flute?"8; "You're only (only!) in your middle teens, / too young to be thinking about seerious things" (HL 28); "Your father (yawn!) has seen enough mischance / trying to figure out the dancers from the dance" (HI 29); "My love 2U" (HL 30). The father's genuine feeling for his children and their well-being is clear, but the lines do not always express that feeling convincingly. The father too ea gerly wishes to talk to his children in what he supposes is their own language and on their own terms; the effect is awkward and condescending and lacks genuineness, in the manner of an adult seeking to emulate a child. Mahon's will ingness to adapt the verse letter in order to "come right out with it and speak frankly" is not at issue; what surprises us here, especially because his formalism has always gone hand in hand with a distinctly contemporary voice and lan guage, is the failure of tone. Indeed, through his work over two decades in radio, television, and, more recently, theater, with versions of Moli?re, Racine, and Eu ripedes, he has gained an even greater stylistic fluency and conversational tone, particularly in the speaking voice, and taken considerable risks in language and technique. "The Hudson Letter," which constitutes Part II of the volume, continues the poet's self-examination begun in "The Yaddo Letter" but is much more sub stantial and successful. A technical tour deforce, it offers a moving expression of the poet's continuing preoccupations. The language, rhythms, and techniques are not only casual, conversational, and fluent; at times, indeed, the language is also demotic, vulgar, and downright obscene. The recipient, no longer the poet's own children, is, however, in one sense Patricia King, to whom the poem is ded icated and whose Irish background and Connecticut country house are referred to in several places. In another sense the series of letters is addressed, in tradi tional fashion, to the poet's Muse. "Sing, Muse," the first letter concludes, as the poet wakes up to hear around him the noises of New York City?"this autistic slammer"?and appeals for inspiration to create his own music: "Oh, show me how to recover my lost nerve! / The radiators knock, whistle and sing." The in vocation is profoundly serious?"seerious? as he puts it in "The Yaddo Letter" (HL 30) in a characteristic Mahon pun on "serious" and "seer"9? but, as his punning suggests, his seriousness is to be conveyed by way of increased free 8.

The temptation, given the racy, demotic, re portage qualities of the verse and the intimate, near confessional tone and man ner? is to underestimate both the form and the serious concerns raised. The work, in fact, indicates more than the use of different material and a change of direction; it constitutes a new and vital contribution to Mahon's oeuvre and to contemporary Irish poetry. "The Hudson Letter" consists of eighteen verse letters, tracing various ex periences in the course of one day in the poet's life in New York City. An obvi ous parallel work following the same temporal structure is Ulysses,10 though the issues raised are those with which Mahon himself has long been preoccupied: home and homelessness; alienation and exile; living "on the edge"; the desire to love and be loved; time and mortality; and, not the least, imagination and its retreat into silence.11 Pursuing a persistent intertextuality, he employs a simi larly Joycean dense network of allusions which the reader is required to recog nize and relate to the poet's larger purpose and meaning. While such allusions are drawn from a wide range of authors, works, and periods, in at least one in stance the intertextual reference is to his own work.12 The intertextual practice of allusion is of a piece with Mahon s preoccupation with forgery and parody or pastiche, just as his own translations from Villon, Corbi?re, Rimbaud, Moli?re and others are, amongst other things, assumptions of personae.13 This essay seeks to shed light on how "The Hudson Letter" should be read, to probe ?o.

Peter Denman has rightly argued, "Mahon's forgery or imitation is complimentary in intent, an act of homage: as he has stated,'it's the mediocre who are inimitable.'"

The setting of all but two letters?"Domnei" and "Key West"?is New York, specifically the poet's "'studio apartment,'" his neighbors, and the neighborhood where he undertakes his various peregrinations: I go nightshoppinglike Frank O'Hara I go bopping up Bleecker for juice, croissants, Perrier, ice-cream and Gitanes filtre, pick up the laundry, get back to five (5!) messages on the answering machine_ (HI 65) Even Letter VIII, the version from Ovid's Metamorphoses, reminds us briefly of the New York in which the version is composed: "(Afternoon now, some silence in the street / till released children dash to bus and swing)" (HL 51)- The juxta position of classical and modern settings is all the more unnerving as the Ovid narrative concerns the infanticide of Itys, Tereus' son, by his mother, Procne, in revenge for Tereus* rape of her sister, Philomela. Sometimes the setting is recreated through newspaper headlines and soundbites, ranging from insider trading, nuclear waste, and weather to pornography and the sex trade, a range illuminating the preoccupations, practices, and values of modern society, in cluding the reduction of language and of love to pornographic signs: INSIDER TRADING REPORTS ARE LINKED TO PRICE OF BONDS NO SOLUTION AT HAND WHILE NUCLEAR WASTE PILES UP NEW YORK TOUGHING IT OUT TO GET THROUGH THE COLD ALT SEX MF FF NIGHT OWL SCAT PEDO SNUFF . .. (HL 47) In Letter V, recreating Bridget Moore's letter home, the setting is given in more conventional terms?"N0.1, Fifth Avenue, New York City. Sept. 14th, 1895" (HL 45)?as does the opening letter: Winter; a short walk from the 10th St. Pier? and what of the kick-start that should be here? The fishy ice lies thick on Gansevoort around the corner, and the snow shines bright about your country house this morning... (HL 37). Conventional or not, the opening lines establish both the season and the time of day, just as the concluding letter takes place at night-time and offers hope for the advent of spring. For, with that season, he hopes for security, comfort, love, and "the serenity / which for a lifetime has eluded me" (HL 37). Reflecting a lack of serenity common to humanity, not just the poet, 24</page><page sequence="6">Derek Mahon's Letters from America Mahon's settings in these poems are invariably liminal: "This morning, from beyond abandoned piers" (HL 41); the poet's "studio"; "the last harbour" of a city bar (Letter VII); or, recounting the escape of rare seabirds from the Bronx Zoo, "... On ledge and rail they sit, Inca tern and Andean gull..." (HL 47). The birds* escape, recorded in one of the poet's news soundbites, relates in turn to the various emigrant personae living a similarly liminal existence?the poet himself, certainly, but also Bridget Moore, John Butler Yeats, W. H. Auden in StMark's Place, the inhabitants of Chinatown, and those homeless and dispos sessed existing "in the restless dark / in the moon-shadows of the World Trade Centre / with Liberty's torch glimmering over the water" (HL 61). Once more juxtaposition proves telling: the amorality of international finance is set off against compassion toward the world's poor and homeless epitomized by the Statue of Liberty and its moving inscription, "Give me your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.,. "14 The allusion reminds us of the ambitious scope of these letters, which go beyond Mahon's particular situation to embrace all humanity. The poet himself is no less "an amateur immigrant," "an undesirable 'resi dent alien' on this shore..." (HL 42), though by the work's end the place of com position indicated?"New York, Dublin, January-September, 1995" (HL 77)? points to his eventual return "home." It is precisely in such liminal settings, whether on shoreline or in crowded urban streets, that Mahon's personae, in the manner of existential heroes, experience enlightenment, and to New York City he attributes, significantly, a "clear existential light" (HL 42). The rare seabirds escaping from the Bronx Zoo take their place among the various birds noted in these letters: the "big gull [which] sat at the masthead all the way / from Roche's Point to Montock" (HL 45); the "urban gulls, crows, and other toughs of the air" (HL 48); the Ovidian nightingale and swallow into which shapes Procne and Philomela are transformed; the "gryphons, roc, velociraptor, hoopoe" in the 1933 film King Kong (HL 65) and even, conceivably, "the little bi planes" (HL 66) that attack Kong or the "747 in flight over Nova Scotia" (HL 72); certainly the blackbird, in the lines presumably translated from the Proven?al troubadour (HL 68), or "sedge-warbler and the yellow bittern" (HL 73). Mahon's birdsongs, however, may be extended to include also human voices, of Louis Armstrong on the car radio (HL 69), a mish-mash of bar conversation or fragments of rap music (HL 76). But to the "harsh blues of the rowdy and the unfortunate, / wolf-howl of the dispossessed, the outcast and the alone" are added "Heart murmur, insomnia, liberal conscience, night moans, / forensic 14- Emma Lazarus, "The New Colossus" (1883), The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, revised 4th ed., ed. Angela Partington (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996), p. 19 25</page><page sequence="7">Derek Mahon's Letters from America fears; pipes knock, a tug-boat groans" (HL 76) and the urban dawn music, when "Tired vents exhale ..." (HL 39). The cityscape, and not just its people, consti tutes one living organism to which the poet gives voice. Mahon's New York takes on a significance similar to that of London in Eliot's The Waste Land, as epito mizing the modern cultural condition, and, like Eliot, he draws heavily on al lusion and voice. "He do the police in different voices," indeed. Supreme importance in all this music belongs to the nightingale, for which Mahon prepares us with the first of his prefatory epigraphs from the seventh stanza of Keats's "Ode to a Nightingale." For the Romantic poet the bird's song was analogous to the eternal status of art; birds became synonymous with poets within the Romantic tradition. Mahon's use of the nightingale emblem, his ref erences to Keats, and his articulation of New York's existential music lead to a vital consideration of the Poet, of the withdrawal of imagination into poetic si lence, and Mahon's own invocation to his Muse. Coleridge, too, is invoked in the course of the letters: the wintry setting and spiritual and poetic stasis, with reference to "The Ancient Mariner" (HL 43), and also to the wind as " 'mad lu tanist,' " from "Dejection: An Ode," now transported to refer to cyclone Angie hitting the Florida coast (HL 69). Coleridge's "conversation poems" are present in the background also, both as models of poetry made more fluent, conversa tional, and intimate, and as moving expressions of separation, for example, "This Lime-Tree Bower, My Prison," and of loss of imagination as in "Frost at Midnight." The first letter is prefaced by an epigraph from a more familiar Mahon ex emplar, Albert Camus,15 whose postwar stay in New York was anything but sat isfactory. The city was also the final resting-place for another long-standing ex emplar, Dylan Thomas, to be joined at the letter's conclusion by Lorca, a third alien artist figure. Within this framework of references suggesting failure and alienation occurs "a radio serendipity to illustrate / the resilience of our lyric appetite"?namely, "Respighi's temperate nightingale on WQXR" (HL 37)?and so to answer the poet's appeal to his Muse, "Oh, show me how to recover my lost nerve!" as well as to join other similarly musical voices: "The radiators knock, whistle and sing. /1 toss and turn and listen, when I wake, / to the first bird and the first garbage truck..." (HL 37). The analogy of Romantic bird and apartment radiator or city garbage truck is daring but in this context it proves wholly effective and convincing. The anthropomorphism Mahon has employed in earlier volumes, in poems like "The Apotheosis of Tins" and "The Mayo Tao," has taught his readers to hear such voices and to recognize their contribution to the world's larger existential music. 15. See "Dying to Get Home," review of Camus's American Journals (1989), in Derek Mahon, Jour nalism: Selected Prose 1970-1995* ed. Terence Brown (Oldcastle: Gallery Press, 1996), pp. 150-52. 26</page><page sequence="8">Derek Mahon's Letters from America Keats's nightingale further reminds us that it bears not only upon places of extremity?"perilous seas" and "fairy lands forlorn"?but also upon people like the biblical Ruth, "when, sick for home, / She stood in tears amid the alien corn." Mahon's poem moves beyond his own predicament?alien, alone, separated from family and seeking inspiration?and yet still impresses us by its compas sion for the homeless and dispossessed, by its attempt to convey the distinctive aloneness many experience in a large metropolitan environment like New York City. Mahon dignifies the urban homeless as reflecting the spiritual plight of so much modern humanity. Those living on the edge, marginal and marginalized, must confront time, mortality, and meaninglessness without the support of lov ing relationships. Mahon quotes an apt graffito: "?question reality, death is back, miguel 141," and by the same artist, "find the cure" (HL 44,58). Once more there is the parallel with Auden and his acknowledgement of the poet's social responsibilities. Mahon writes in "Alien Nation," "I know you and you me, you wretched buggers, / and I've no problem calling you my brothers / for I have been homeless and in detox," and elsewhere he declares"We are all far from home, be our home still / a Chicago slum, a house under Cave Hill / or a cara van parked in a field above Cushendun" (HL 62). What is important is to sur vive, a survival made possible through security, home, and love and character ized in turn by the song of the nightingale Muse. Hence, in "Imbolc: J.B.Y." Mahon incorporates in his own sketch of the painter John Butler Yeats, who lived out his final years in New York City, phrases from the father's letters to his poet son, especially his meeting a young Irish emigrant woman on the dockside whose dignified suffering impressed him and provoked his definition of per sonality?" 'The nightingale sings with his breast against a thorn, / it's out of pain that personality is born* " (HL 73)?a position from which the mature Keats saw the world as a "Vale of Soul-Making."16 Like W. B. Yeats and, before him, Keats, Mahon has been accused of aes theticism, not just of an excessive preoccupation with form, stanzaic unit, rhyme; of elegance and cleverness of technique but also of an exclusiveness to which he might retreat rather than deal with more untidy, unpleasant quotid ian realities. The Byzantium of Art is thus conceived to be preferable to the Belfast of the "Troubles" or of the stultifying 1950s, and certainly Mahon's crit icisms of each place and time persist throughout his earlier volumes. Yet, while Keats's nightingale is emblematic of poetry's eternal character, "heard / In an i6. To George and Georgiana Keats (April 1819), The Letters of John Keats, ed. Hyder E.

By the conclusion of Keats's ode the poet is tolled back to his "sole self" to confront the antithetical worlds of dream and reality. Likewise, the "music" that Mahon articulates and transmutes into art in "The Hudson Letter" is shot through with pain and suffering, seen vividly in a coda to his Ovid version of the rape of Philomela and her transformation into a nightingale: ... Never mind the hidden agenda, the sub-text; it's not really about male arrogance, 'rough sex' or vengeful sisterhood, but about art and the encoded mysteries of the human heart. (HL 52) Rather than inhabiting a palace of art, Mahon's poet is preoccupied with the human heart, whose mysteries are conveyed and explored by way of his dense network or code of allusions and intricate working of particular motifs?mys teries which in turn are central to the true nature of art. At the center of this network are three "old masters," long-standing Mahon exemplars: William Shakespeare, W. B. Yeats, and W. H. Auden. Both Hamlet and The Tempest have figured at various points in Mahon's ear lier work. Sometimes the reference is made explicit, as in "The hebona behind the smile," acknowledged in a note to the 1970 poem "Beyond Howth Head": uHebona. The poison used by Claudius to kill Hamlet's father. One may smile and smile and be a villain." Even without the note the reader is given a further hint with the reference in the same stanza to "Denmark's hot iambics" (SP 45). In "The Apotheosis of Tins" the personae adopt the role of Yorick: "we shall lie like skulls / in the hands of soliloquists" (P 74). Indeed, Mahon has also con tributed to the Poems for Shakespeare series with an uncollected poem, "Stone and Driftwood," in which the poet, prefaced by an epigraph from Lear, assumes a Prospero-like pose, studying "this piece / of driftwood cast / among my books... ,"17 In "North Wind: Portrush," Prospero and Lear are set off explic itly against the "benighted coast" and inhabitants of North Antrim: the wind sounds "Like the high keen of a lost / Lear-spirit in agony" while the poet re 17. Poems for Shakespeare 9, ed. Dannie Abse (London: Globe Playhouse Publications, 1981), pp. 16-17. 28</page><page sequence="10">Derek Mahon's Letters from America tain "Prospero and his people never / Came to these stormy parts" (SP124-25). It might be expected that such figures as Hamlet and Lear would find their place among Mahon's long gallery of existential heroes, while the issue of Art and its mysterious origins and the artist's responsibility to his society finds ample res onance in Shakespeare's Prospero. Hamlet and The Tempest are joined in "The Hudson Letter" by a further late play, The Winter's Tale. "The Hudson Letter" itself is in fact another "winter's tale," although its conclusion is scarcely so certain as Shakespeare's play in its transformation. Nevertheless, in Letter IX, addressed to his own children, Mahon admits, ... I like to think all this is a winter's tale around a hearth (but whose?) and that when we tell the story ten years hence you'll be able to say, Thou meetest with things dying, I with things new-born.' (HI 54) The use of the Shepherd's line to his Clown-son ironically reverses roles and has the father, Mahon, in characteristic self-deprecation, playing the Clown to his children's greater wisdom and faith in a future. Letter VII, consisting simply of fragments of barroom conversation, is prefaced by Leontes' line from the same play: "I have drunk and seen the spider." In Letter IV the poet explores the New York waterfront at the 10th Street Pier and experiences "the throes of a warm snap / so ice cracks far off like a thunderclap / somewhere along Bohemia's desert coast" (HL 43). The reference, as every schoolchild is taught, illustrates Shakespeare's poetic licence. Bohemia has neither desert nor coast, though both feature crucially in the play The Winters Tale. Thus the ship carrying Antigonus and Perdita is wrecked in a storm, Antigonus devoured by a bear, and the child, Perdita, found, given home and foster parents, raised in pastoral innocence, en abling her to contribute to the transformation and reconciliation with which the play concludes. Mahon seeks both transformation and reconciliation in "The Hudson Letter," motifs made all the more closely related to art by way of the thunderclap. Shakespeare often employs thunder, storm, and lightning for dramatic effect, to suggest physical and spiritual extremities, supernatural dis approval or divine intervention, set off against the harmony and restorative powers of music. Hence, in The Winters Tale, the storm, shipwreck, and loss of life of Act III are replaced at the play's conclusion by peace, order, reunion, and regeneration, in which music plays an essential part. Mahon's thunder, however, has a more likely recent origin in Randall Jar rell's description of a poet: as one interviewer reported, "Asked for his view of 'the Poet,' a poker-faced Mahon refers to Jarrell's comment which cites the poet as one who stands under a tree in the hope of being struck by lightning."18 The 29</page><page sequence="11">Derek Mahon's Letters from America deliberately ironic, even facetious, description nevertheless makes serious points about the mysterious origins of the imagination and a poet's persistent fear of its eventual absence. In the "Global Village" (HL 41-42) of New York City?a phrase that melds McLuhan-speak and Shakespeare's Globe?Mahon describes himself as "an Irish Bohemian" surrounded by car-stickers that bear directly upon his responsibilities, social and aesthetic, as a poet such as: "? love one another, resist insipid rhyme ?" and concludes with a self-por trait in which the Jarrell description is rearticulated. Mahon calls on another exemplar, George Herbert, to reinforce larrell's analogy with lightning and thunderstorm, and one more invocation to the Muse is offered as the poet de scribes himself: exposed in thunderstorms, as once before, and hoping to draw some voltage one more time or at least not die of spiritual cowardice. After so many deaths I live and write' cried, once, Geo. Herbert in his Wiltshire plot: does lightning ever strike in the same place twice? (HL 42) Like Mahon, Herbert anticipates his Muse's return and, in the imagery of springtime and regeneration, his budding again, also after experiencing "tem pests" and a "shrivel'd heart."19 The conjunction of artist and storm continues in the description of Key West after a cyclone, set in motion, as some would have it by the phenomenon of El Nino and "sea-changing all with its rough magic"?an echo of Ariel's song, "Full fathom five," and of Prospero's abjuring his "rough magic." In The Tem pest, both characters epitomize art and magic through which they achieve trans formation and reconciliation. Intertextuality itself, like translation of another author, involves acts of transformation and, in the assumption of other voices, reconciliation, even of a political kind. As Mahon commented early in his ca reer, "the act of writing is itself political in the fullest sense.

What begins as a review of Rory*s situation turns quickly into ruthless self-examination on Mahon's part, to which Yeats's conception, in "Ego Dominus Tuus," of Keats with his face " 'pressed to a sweet-shop window' " and Fitzgerald's Gatsby both contribute. Mahon con ceives of himself as a "Polonius of the twilight zone" when the poet-father advises his son: Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar, shun the fatuous rectitude of received opinion, new-speak and euphemism. Don't 'stick up for your rights' or worry about your self-esteem; contrive your own life and live it by your own lights where such considerations don't apply. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy. Be sceptical but whole-hearted; don't be shy; avoid spirits and nicotine; read Stendhal on love; trust your own instincts, even the most fugitive; and welcome to la condition humaine. (HL 59) Realizing he may sound as pompous as Polonius, Mahon concludes in charac teristically ironic fashion by undercutting what he has just urged: "Cheer up, son; oh, and above all disbelieve / the cynic who tries to tell you how to behave / for, as Confucius said, fine words are seldom humane" (HL 60). Yet humanity and humaneness are Mahon's particular concerns and, in advising his son, it is wholly appropriate that he should establish the proper balance between cyni cism and humanity, between acknowledgement of la condition humaine and the need to respond humanely in the face of existential hurt. By wearing the mask of Polonius, as by using other Shakespeare allusions, Mahon can pursue the leit motif of restoration and regeneration; he can balance feeling with wit and irony, and puncture any possible self-inflation, at the same time that he advances the poem's movement toward spring thaw and poetic liberation. From the outset of Mahon's career, the poetry of W. H. Auden has pro foundly influenced his work. It was upon Auden's exploration of the verse let ter, together with that of Louis MacNeice, another powerful early influence, that Mahon drew in his earlier versions of the form. In "Beyond Howth Head," Mahon explicitly quotes Auden's "New Year Letter."21 The points of contact be tween the two poets are numerous, one correspondence that bears upon both 21. Auden's line "we are changed by what we change," is identified in Mahon's notes to Beyond Howth Head, Poetry Ireland Editions (Dublin: Dolmen Press, 1970), p. 16. 31</page><page sequence="13">Derek Mahon's Letters from America Mahon's work in general and "The Hudson Letter" in particular is the concep tion of "art as fun, as play."22 Mahon recognizes the dangers implicit in such a conception, dangers he notes Auden did not always avoid, for the ludic charac ter of poetry bears upon his own wit, parody, and wordplay and, in The Hud son Letter, his interest in playfulness encouraged him to pursue the light verse forms of clerihew and river-rhyme. He admitted in 1981 to "a kind of heresy" that poetry "is just a childish game," but added, in typical counterpoint, "Yet it's something that has become my life, or at least a very important part of it." Like wise, "poetry is a craft, but not one that provides something useful for the com munity, except perhaps by the way. You could describe it as a serious game, and people play it by different rules."23 While he may deny poetry any utilitarian function, Mahon's sincere feeling for the New York City homeless might be seen as providing "something useful for the community"?but it does so only "by the way." The characteristic indirection enables him to avoid mere didacticism and to enlarge the scope of the poem. The point would not be lost on Auden whose courage, enlightenment, and humanity he acknowledges in Letter X, "Auden at St. Mark's Place" (HL 56-57). The portrait, exact in its biographical detail, is at the same time a loving trib ute from one poet to another: Hail, floppy-slippered bear of St. Mark's Place! I seem to glimpse your cheesy, limestone face where you loom at a dirty window, gin in paw, on a hot evening during the great Cold War. Praising Auden for his "grumpy love," his criticism of modern society, his in sistence upon "personal responsibility," his courage in the face of homophobic threats, and his elevation of agape, Mahon captures the older poet's vision, imagery, and manner: "Oh, far from Mother, in the unmarried city, / you con template a new ode to Euphrosyne, / goddess of banquets." But he also asks a question that bears upon his own performance in these letters: "When will we hear once more the pure voice of elation / raised in the nightwood of known symbol and allusion?" The tribute involves assumption of the older poet's per sona?a translation of sorts?achieved, in part, through echo and allusion. The tribute is all the more effective for its acknowledgement of Auden's own folly, in an explicit echo of his famous elegy on Yeats: "if you were often silly...." But any folly is outweighed in Mahon's mind by Auden's poetic voice, enabling re demption and regeneration. 22. "The Right to Play," rev. of Auden's The Dyer's Hand (1988), Journalism, p. 164. 23. Mahon, "Each poem for me is a new beginning," p. 10. 32</page><page sequence="14">Derek Mahon's Letters from America W.B.Yeats, whose presence in Mahon's previous work and whose greatness he has long acknowledged, enables further decoding of the heart's mysteries? the terms possess a Yeatsian resonance.24 Yeats, like Auden, surfaced by way of echo and allusion in the earlier verse letter, "Beyond Howth Head," and again in "The Yaddo Letter" with the poet-father "trying to figure out the dancers from the dance" (HL 29). John Redmond has even argued that Auden's voice over rides that of Yeats in Mahon's verse letters specifically to enable him to avoid Yeats's grand and authoritative manner.25 Be that as it may, Yeats appears more extensively, if indirectly, in "The Hudson Letter" when, in Letter XVII, Mahon employs the letters of John Butler Yeats to his poet-son to recreate the father's last years in New York City.26 Once more Mahon indicates parallels, seeing him self as "A recovering Ulster Protestant like you from Co. Down..." and noting also the elder Yeats's emigrant status; his commitment to his art; his personal failings; his compassionate response to pain and alienation; his being "at home here and in human nature" while at the same time remaining "like all of us, then as now, 'an exile and a stranger.' " Mahon can identify with John Butler Yeats more readily than with his distinguished son whose "Prayer for My Daughter" he revises in his own advice to Katie.27 As we have seen, in place of the Yeatsian virtues of "courtesy," "custom and ... ceremony," Mahon wishes for "some rich myth of reconciliation" in terms drawn from The Winter's Tale. Rather than the authoritative Yeatsian father, cer tain of his values in the face of existential storm and social and intellectual dis array, Mahon as father concedes his own failures: "too busy growing up myself, I failed to watch you grow." Instead of wallowing in self-pity, however, Mahon expresses a humanity in which folly and weakness are just as likely as the Yeat sian virtues. The "satirical view" he attributes to his daughter is reflected in his own effective undercutting of Yeats's advice: "how not to rely on looks / only, but on acquired skills and the wisdom found in books?/ up to a point, of course...." Instead, the poet father advises "listening to the innermost silence of the heart" and "dreaming at all times our uninterruptable dream / of re demptive form." Just as the Yeatsian virtues are deliberately undercut by 24. Mahon has said, "Discovering poetry at the age of 14, Yeats's *The Stolen Child'?that was the first poem that really turned me on."

Mahon's irony and wit continue to serve him well; the Yeatsian model, against which this verse letter plays, is rearticulated in the younger poet's own more human and less hieratic terms. Thus, this sequence of letters concludes with the poignant wish for a return home, as Mahon engages in one more act of intertextuality. The details recall his own work and the various domestic interiors, often in Belfast, that his per sonae have glimpsed over the years?but nearly always at a remove, from out side, alienated:28 the magic garden in the lost domain, the vigilant lamplight glimpsed through teeming rain, the house, the stove in the kitchen, the warm bed, the hearth, the vrai lieu, ranged crockery overhead ? (HI 75) Yet the poet's voice and vision are more inclusive than these details suggest. Mahon groups himself with the "drifters, loners, harsh and disconsolate" not out of self-pity but out of identification with and compassion for the world's homeless and alienated. Vividly capturing "the 24-hr film set" which is New York City, its "Trump Tower and the United Nations, / the marble halls of finance," Mahon has pursued a spiritual journey involving "the subway walls of the brain, / the good, the bad, the ugly and the insane." He articulates the urban music of this society, the "harsh blues of the rowdy and the unfortunate, / wolf-howl of the dispossessed, the outcast and the alone" (HL 76), and in so doing avoids self pity by moving out of himself to empathize with such outcasts. In Letter XIII, "Sappho in 'Judith's Room,' " Mahon declares "Nothing was alien to me, noth ing unhuman" (HL 63)?a tricky succession of masks in which Mahon adopts the role of the Greek woman poet Sappho in the renowned feminist New York bookstore, Judith's Room, quoting the Latin dramatist, Terence "Homo sum; hu mani nil a me alienum pwto.""My theme is love and love's daimonic character," Mahon as Sappho affirms, in terms Yeats himself used, terms which establish the inclusiveness that Mahon as Yeats seeks through the wearing of masks. The final Letter XVIII is titled "The Small Rain," a title that originates in the poignant call for home, security, comfort, and love found in the sixteenth-cen tury anonymous lyric, "Western Wind": Western wind, when will thou blow, The small rain down can rain? 28. See "The Spring Vacation" (P 4)&gt; "The Blackbird" (SP101), "Courtyards in Delft" {SP120-21), although "the lost domain" also offers the poignant insight that "home is where the heart breaks" ("Craigvara House," 156-58). 34</page><page sequence="16">Derek Mahon's Letters from America Christ, if my love were in my arms And I in my bed again!29 The allusion, one more in the intricate network of echo and allusion Mahon employs in "The Hudson Letter," indicates, like all the others, that the poet's par ticular plight is shared by all humanity, not merely those of a particular time, place, society, or civilization. The resonant music created by these echoes and allusions tells of an existential predicament, a hurt felt in the heart. It is the func tion of art to explore that predicament and express that hurt: to decode heart's mysteries. Hence, at the poem's conclusion, Mahon addresses once more the Muse-friend to whom the letters were written?"guardian angel, best friend"? knowing also that "the voyage is never done." But just as the biblical "no rm. at the inn" is rearticulated in updated American hotel-speak, thus collapsing time into the poem's present tense, so, too, the poem's spatial scope extends in Yeat sian fashion to embrace "gaseous planets," Nineveh and Babylon, and the music is that of "nightingale and dolphin"?the last a further acknowledgement of the presence in these letters of Keats and Yeats.30 The heartfelt appeal for love and home, indicated in the concluding letter's title, is thus meant to concern "the icy heart of February," but also to involve the poet in his invocation to his Muse and all humanity whose need for comfort, security, and community in the face of time and mortality remains constant. "We have been too long in the cold.? Take us in; take us in!" Here, Mahon's use of the first person plural pronoun, far from casual, is deliberate and touching in its inclusiveness. Because it is impossible to reproduce the entire network of echo and allusion? only the poem itself manages to do that effectively?it might be claimed that such density is self-defeating, either an example of the poet's excessive clever ness of his extensive reading, or of his conception of poetry as a game. That would be to misread the poem and to fail to acknowledge its extraordinary ac complishments. By marrying its contemporary setting and material and per sistently colloquial language with the time-honored poetic device of the invo cation to the Muse, Mahon effectively updates the traditional poetic form in which the poet appeals for inspiration. The poem employs echo and allusion in rich and extensive intertextuality to provide sounding boards for Mahon's own preoccupations, so establishing the perennial nature of his concerns. Finally? and not the least?all this has been achieved with wit, humor and dazzling tech 29- Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, ed. Angela Partington, p. 19. 30.

The poem's meaning and scope are made possible only through Mahon's intertextual practice, yet its achievement is more than the sum of its many references and various exemplars. "The Hudson Letter" dis plays Mahon's persistent willingness to explore new channels of articulating la condition humaine and the poet's role regarding that condition. He has always been willing to take risks, impudently encouraging his reader to "watch this space "31 He has also always proved fascinating to watch. The Hudson Letter, for all its uneven quality as a volume, has shown Mahon to be a distinctive and ex citing poet, extending the boundaries of contemporary Irish poetry.
