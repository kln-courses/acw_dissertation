<plain_text><page sequence="1">CATHY CARUTH The Force of Example: Kant's Symbols Recent literary theory has raised objections to what appears to be an overex- clusive concern with "language" in poststructuralist literary criticism. While literary texts are linguistic constructs, so critics have argued, language itself must be seen in a historical and social context. Literary criticism must there- fore turn to fields in the social sciences, such as sociology and history, to provide an understanding of the nonlinguistic elements which surround and in part determine the language of the texts which literary criticism studies. Oth- erwise it will be at risk of wrongly imperializing the nonlinguistic world with what happens to be its particular object of interest, and consequently of limit- ing its understanding of its own object as well.1 This objection is important because it raises a question that was at one time not limited to literary criticism but pertained to the nonmathematical sciences in general, that is, whether and in what way they give access to a knowledge of the world. In the particular form in which the recent objections concerning literary criticism are raised, however, the problem tends to be located, implicitly, in the object of study; the error is seen to be contingent upon the linguistic makeup of the objects with which literary criticism is concerned. If we turn to the philosophical texts in which the question of discursive theoretical knowledge was originally posed, however, the problem does not begin with the nature of the object but with the nature of the theory itself. The entire project of Kant's critical philosophy could be considered, indeed to be an attempt to discover whether a theory based on concepts rather than on mathematics and empirical evidence could provide any systematic knowledge whatsoever. In order to provide any knowledge of objects, philoso- phy had to be able to systematize itself, as rigorously as mathematics. Whether 1.

Said, in The World, The Text, and The Critic (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1983). 17</page><page sequence="2">18 Yale French Studies discursive theory could say something about the world depended on what it could say about itself. If we are to remember the questions raised again today in the field of literary theory we must first ask, not "What can a theory of liter- ature know?" but "What can theory know?" Kant is a good place to examine this question not only because he first asked it in this form, but because his critical philosophy has seemed particu- larly dependent upon nondiscursive science, specifically Newtonian physics. Kant's answer to what philosophy can know, that is, has seemed to be closely linked to what Newtonian physics knows, and hence appears, itself, circum- scribed by an empirical/historical determinant. But it turns out that in Kant, the particular concept that will eventually allow theory to know is the concept of self-limitation that is best thought in terms of symbolic language. To some extent, then, an examination of the relation between critical philosophy and nondiscursive science will reveal that in order for philosophy to systematize itself, it will first have to symbolize itself in its own self-knowledge. In the "Preface" to the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant describes the dilemma of a metaphysics fallen into disrepute in the face of the successes of mathematics and natural science. The success of the mathe- matical sciences, Kant suggests, is that they base their method on an act of rational self-reflection in which the object is recognized as a representation of reason.2 The structure of scientific method is one of self-recognition; what reason sees in nature is precisely itself. Reason thus makes progress in mathe- matics and physics because through their objects, number and empirical nature, rational thought learns more and more about itself. In this context, the failure of metaphysics contains a peculiar irony, since it is the science con- cerned most directly with what would seem purely rational, that is conceptual, objects. In the one science in which it would seem to have the best chance of confronting itself directly, it is the least successful: reason is somehow fur- thest from itself when it is potentially nearest (Critique, 21). It has thus come to recognize itself first of all in the sciences in which it must detour through sensible intuition, through an "application" of concepts to objects, and hence through something exterior to the concept as such. The successes of the sciences which Kant describes in the second preface are more than a point of comparison for metaphysical failure: in the context in which he is writing, they would seem, indeed, to be the very cause of the metaphysical dilemma. In 1687, Newton had published the laws of motion in his Principia, sparking a series of debates which centered around what might be considered the central innovation of the Principia: Newton's assertion that the movement of massive bodies separated in space could be explained in 2.

The concept of attractive force was a breakthrough because it provided a way of explaining and testing the Copernican astronomy, which had no way of proving its claims over the Ptolemaic system. But the strength of the concept of gravitation for physics was also its bane for philosophy. The problem that inspired the com- mentary of Locke, Leibniz, Hume and others was that while the Newtonian formulas worked effectively in predicting physical phenomena, and seemed to be inductively justified-that is, while the law of gravitation seemed perfectly "true"-the concept of attractive force as a physical event, an attraction across empty space, made no sense in rational terms. "Action at a distance, " or "grav- itation," seemed to be a speculative "hypothesis" or in Leibniz's terms an "occult quality." Thus the concept of gravitation seemed to achieve scientific (mathematical-empirical) explanation at the cost of philosophical understand- ing. The laws of the empirical world were beyond the grasp of a philosophical understanding that was not as rigorous as a mathematically governed system.3 It was the innovation of critical philosophy to question the attempt to model philosophical understanding on mathematics or scientific law. Instead of asking "How can philosophy understand the world?" criticism would ask "How is philosophical understanding different from scientific understand- ing? " Thus in the "Doctrine of Method" of the first Critique, Kant defines the rigor of philosophical method through its difference from mathematics: ... mathematics and philosophy, although in natural science they do, indeed, go hand in hand, are none the less so completely different, that the procedure of the one can never be imitated by the other. The exactness of mathematics rests upon definitions, axioms and demonstrations . .. whereas philosophy consists precisely in knowing its limits . . . [Critique, 585. Translation modified] If the rigor of mathematics consists in the complete and autonomous defini- tion of its objects, the rigor of philosophy consists in the determination, not of an object (including itself), but of a knowledge of its own "limits." What it knows is precisely the ways in which it cannot know objects directly or com- pletely. Such a negative knowledge is not, therefore, a knowledge of an object as such but rather of its own relation to an object. To know its limits is to know that its knowledge of an object is always relational, a relation between the object and itself. This produces a kind of double limitation: on the one hand, philosophy will know that it can never know objects in themselves, that is, that it "can never transcend the limits of possible experience" (Critique, 24); its "transcendental" concepts will always only provide knowledge of the rela- tion between themselves and an empirical "given." On the other hand, the knowledge of this limitation must itself remain limited: it must be understood in terms of a relation to something that is not knowledge. This "something" is 3.

Davis (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1970).</page><page sequence="4">20 Yale French Studies precisely the supersensible, which is not grasped by "knowing" [erkennen] but only posited by "thinking" [denken].4 What critical philosophy ultimately knows then is simply this relation between knowing and thinking: philosophy remains suspended between a direct knowledge of empirical objects and any knowledge of the supersensible, which it can only "think." In this principle of suspension, the difference between mathematics and philosophy has been con- verted from a flaw hindering metaphysical progress into the very ground of its rigor. Kant thus establishes a link between purely conceptual knowledge and the natural sciences on the basis of the conceptual principle of limitation. That is, it is the rigorous negativity of conceptual self-reflection that links it to the rigors of mathematical calculation. Indeed, the relation between natural sci- ence and philosophy in Kant's system could be defined in terms of what they don't know: while natural science explains the world directly, it gives up the possibility of understanding it, and philosophy, while it understands, cannot understand the world. On this basis Kant develops the elaborate system called the "architectonic, " divided between the purely "transcendental laws, " which provide the "conditions of possibility" of experience-for example the law that "every change must have a cause"; the "metaphysical laws," which are based on the transcendental laws as well as on mathematics and empirical "givens," and explain the fundamental features of the material world-for example the law that "every change of matter must have an external cause," i.e., Newton's first law of motion;5 and the physical laws, which concern more specific characteristics of the physical world.6 Thus, in the case of force, "met- aphysics" (which is basically Newtonian physics) need only explain the law mathematically and be able to test and prove its effects experimentally, while philosophy need only explain the transcendental conditions for knowing the concept-i.e., the law of causality. The centrality of the enigma of force in the most rigorous of natural sciences is linked to the centrality of the negative self- reflection of conceptual knowledge in critical philosophy. Certain problems have arisen, however, concerning this close correspon- dence of natural science and philosophy, which would seem to be the triumph of critical rigor. Many readers of Kant have suggested that what determines the structure of the system is not, in fact, a conceptual principle, but an analogy with the already constituted science of physics, upon which Kant based his conception of philosophy. The most rigorous of defenders of the conceptual independence of the system, Gerd Buchdahl, while insisting on the general applicability of the transcendental laws to empirical "givens" (or to "experi- ence"), also notes that in the relation to metaphysics there is "the working of 4. A general discussion of this distinction can be found in the second preface, 27ff. 5. This is discussed in detail below. 6. This is the "theoretical" part of the system, concerned with the realm of "nature"; the place of the other part of the system, concerned with "freedom," is discussed briefly below.</page><page sequence="5">CATHY CARUTH 21 something like analogy," and he concludes that Newtonian physics to some extent "historically conditioned the general construction of the architec- tonic."7 Ultimately, then, in spite of its pretensions, the critical philosophy would seem incapable of wresting itself from basically empirical determi- nants. What philosophical theory knows, in Kant, would still depend on, and to that extent be secondary to, what empirical science knows. Buchdahl's use of the word "analogy" calls attention to the way in which Newtonian physics, or more specifically, the relation between force and mo- tion, seems to serve as the model for all conceptual relations within the tran- scendental system. The entire concept of relation seems to be modelled, in fact, on the concept of the event and its effects, or the nonphenomenal occur- rence and its representation. Thus, in the first Critique, the pure transcenden- tal concepts which Kant defines in his "Table of Categories" are divided into the "mathematical" and "dynamical," with the three "Analogies of Experi- ence" in the latter corresponding closely to the three laws of motion in the "Metaphysics." The distinction between the mathematical and dynamical categories is itself reiterated in the larger division between the Analytic and the Dialectic of the first Critique, or the analysis of what philosophy can know and what it can just think. And once again, the division between Analytic and Dialectic in the theoretical realm is repeated in the division between the- oretical philosophy and practical philosophy, or the branches of philosophy concerned with the knowledge of nature and with human action. Criticism's own model for its negative self-knowledge would thus appear to be that of a knowledge turned upon itself by the action of a force heterogeneous to, but not separable from, this motion.8 The entire conceptual structure of critical phi- losophy would thus appear to be taken over from Newtonian physics, to look to the empirical world both for the basis of its conceptual structures (modelling its own laws on the laws of physics) and the basis of its own self-representation (representing itself on the model of empirical events). Hence the very knowl- edge of the difference from empirical law which forms the basis of critical thought appears to be, itself, modelled on an empirical event, and the knowl- 7.

This would be the case also for the famous "Copernican Analogy" in the second preface, along with the footnote on Newton which follows it some pages later. The power of this model is so strong, indeed, that the Critique of Judgment, which is meant to bridge the "gap" between the theoretical and practical realms, is also divided in the same manner: between aesthetic and tele- ological judgment, in aesthetic judgment between the beautiful and the sublime, and in the sublime between the "mathematical" and the "dynamical" sublime.

It would be useful, however, before jumping to conclusions, to look some- what more closely at the actual place in which Kant introduces Newtonian physics, the Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science. In the "Preface" to this work, Kant himself comments on the curious dependence of transcenden- tal philosophy on metaphysical law. He sees this dependent relation in the ''example": . . . it is indeed very remarkable (but cannot here be thoroughly entered into) that general metaphysics in all cases where it requires examples [Beispiele] (intuitions) in order to provide meaning [Bedeutung] for its pure concepts of the understanding must always take them from the general doctrine of body, i.e., from the form and principles of external intuition [dussere Anschauung]; and if these instances are not at hand in their entirety it gropes [herumtappe], uncertain and trembling, among mere meaningless concepts.... And so a separate metaphysics of corporeal nature does excellent and indispensable service to general metaphysics, inasmuch as the former provides exam- ples [Beispiele] (cases in concreto) in which to realize the concepts and propositions of the latter (properly, transcendental philosophy), i.e., to give to a mere form of thought sense and meaning [Sinn und Bedeutung].9 Kant is concerned here with the fact that transcendental philosophy, as a purely formal structure, a "mere form of thought" [eine blosse Gedanken- form], depends on something outside of the concept, or "examples," for its "meaning" [Bedeutung]. What surprises Kant however is not just the depen- dence of the "form" on any illustrative "intuition," but rather the dependence of the form specifically on "external intuition" or "the general doctrine of body." External intuition, here, is not just a content which gives meaning to the conceptual form, but itself has a "form" and "principles" in the science of dynamics: it is another "form" which is the meaning of the "mere form" of thought. The need for something "external" to thought is thus, here, different from the need for "experience" in general which Kant emphasizes throughout the first Critique: it is another kind of externality represented by the depen- dence of the form of transcendental philosophy on the form of Newtonian science, a doubling of form and form. This doubling reappears in the use of the word "external" in the Founda- tions as a whole, in which it comes to stand for two different kinds of relation. In the "Preface," Kant first speaks of the doctrine of body as the science which 9. Immanuel Kant, Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science, trans. James W.

Here matter, defined as motion, is "external" in so far as it is "given" to the concept; it is that empirical "given" to which the concept must always stand in relation. Yet matter as motion, as Kant writes of it in the main work, is defined by "external relations" in a much more formal sense: the motion of a thing is said to be "the change of its external relations to a given space" (Foun- dations, 21). In this case, "external" refers to relations that can be calculated mathematically. Thus matter, in so far as it affects the "external senses," is that which is given to them; but in so far as it is determined by "external relations," is that which can be calculated. "External" thus seems to mean both the "philosophical" relation which defines the negativity of conceptual self-reflection, and the purely mathematical relation of number. The pecu- liarity of the metaphysical "example" thus lies in the joining of these two kinds of "external" relations. The joining of two external relations, it turns out, becomes the very princi- ple of the central law of the Foundations. In the "second law of mechanics," Kant reformulates Newton's first law (which, with the other two, gave rise to the theory of gravitation) in terms of the transcendental law of causality. It is thus here that he joins the central principles of transcendental philosophy and metaphysics: Proposition Second law of mechanics: Every change of matter has an external cause [eine dussere Ursache]. (Every body remains in its state of rest or motion in the same direction and with the same velocity unless it is compelled by an external cause to forsake this state). Proof (In universal metaphysics there is laid down the proposition that every change has a cause; here there is only to be proved of matter that its change must always have an external cause.) Matter as mere object of the senses has no other determinations than those of external relations in space [der ausseren Verhaltnisse im Raume] and hence undergoes no changes except by motion. With regard to such change, insofar as it is an exchange of one motion with another, or of motion with rest, and vice versa, a cause of such change must be found (according to the principle of metaphysics). But this cause cannot be internal [innerlich], for matter has no absolutely internal determinations and grounds of determination. Hence all change of matter is based upon an external cause (i.e., a body remains etc.) [Foundations, 104-15] In the "Proposition" Kant reformulates Newton's first law in metaphysical terms in order to show its relation to transcendental principles. In this refor- mulation, the difference between the "second law of mechanics" and the tran- scendental law of causality lies primarily in the addition of the word "exter- nal." Its significance is also emphasized by the fact that the reiteration of the law in stricter Newtonian form (in parentheses) replaces Newton's "forces"</page><page sequence="8">24 Yale French Studies [vis], with the phrase "external cause." 10 Thus the entire weight of the law, in so far as it articulates metaphysical and transcendental principles, rests on the notion of the "external." In the "Proof," moreover, this term can be seen to involve a double meaning, referring both to the definition of matter and to the explanation of its change. For matter is defined, first of all, in terms of "exter- nal relations," in which "external" means purely mathematical calculability. But in the application of the transcendental law to matter, "external" refers to that which affects "external relations," i.e., to that which is external to exter- nal relations. This latter externality cannot be discovered empirically but only by the use of a transcendental concept. Thus at this moment, in the phrase "external cause," "external" is no longer precisely mathematical (or em- pirical) but conceptual. The example of force as an "external cause" expresses, therefore, the precise point of articulation between metaphysical and tran- scendental law in terms of a principle of double relation or "externality." In the "Observation" which follows the proof, Kant comments on the centrality of this law for natural philosophy. The doubleness of the external as mathematical and as empirical now is given a different name, that of "lifelessness": This mechanical alone must be called the law of inertia (lexinertiae); the law that every action has an equal and opposite reaction cannot bear this name. For the latter says what matter does, but the former only what it does not do, and this is better adapted to the expression of inertia. The inertia of matter is and signifies [bedeutet] nothing but its lifelessness [Leblosigkeit], as matter in itself. Life [Leben] means the capacity of a sub- stance to determine itself to act from an internal principle .... Now, we know of no other principle of a substance to change its state but desire . . . but these determining grounds and actions do not at all belong to the representations of the external senses and hence also not to the determinations of matter as matter. Therefore, all matter as such is lifeless [leblos]. The proposition of inertia says so much and no more.... The pos- sibility of a natural science proper rests entirely upon the law of inertia (along with the law of the permanence of substance). The opposite of this, and therefore the death of all natural philosophy [der Tod aller Naturphilosophie], would be hylozoism. [Founda- tions, 105-06] The significance of the law of inertia within the critical system is emphasized here in terms of its purely negative character: much like transcendental philos- ophy itself, it is concerned less with positive assertion than with a kind of limitation. It is this negativity that would essentially bind the metaphysical law to the transcendental one: the expression of what matter does not do corresponds to the expression of what transcendental concepts cannot know. This not knowing, moreover, is specifically defined as a suspension of all 10. Newton's first law is translated by Motte as follows: "Every body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it." See Sir Isaac Newton, Principia, vol 1., Motte's trans. revised by Florian Cajori (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1934), 1.</page><page sequence="9">CATHY CARUTH 25 comparisons between matter, or motion and its causes, to human life: the power of the law to suspend understanding and confine itself to calculation lies in its resistance to any figurations which compare matter with the mind or personify it, as in "hylozoism"; matter "in itself," as the cause of its own movements, remains utterly outside this sort of comprehension. Kant clearly has in mind here the various attempts to explain attractive force in terms of a kind of inner life of matter, but it is significant that he carefully elides the word "force" here and uses instead the word "lifelessness." "Lifeless" [leblos] is itself a purely negative determination which encompasses both the externality of matter as "external relations" in space, and the externality of material cause: the event of force as a purely calculable and incomprehensible occur- rence can only be understood negatively by saying that it is not a living action. The word "lifeless" thus represents the full negativity whose hinge between the different parts of the system, is the "giving up" of a claim to understanding (in the case of natural science) or of direct knowledge (in the case of transcen- dental philosophy). "Lifelessness," then, expresses the relational quality of all conceptual knowledge which knows in its object only its own relation to a "something" that is not fully determined. The rigor of this use of the word "lifeless" for a purely conceptual nega- tivity gives way further on in the passage, however, to a different kind of language, when Kant informs us that the opposite of "inertia," or hylozoism, "would be the death of all philosophy." The interest of this phrase is not just that it is meant figuratively, but that the figurative meaning turns on the notion of lifelessness, which is now characterized positively, and more hu- manly, as "death" [Tod]. If matter is characterized as purely inhuman, philoso- phy dies a very personal death, one which establishes a specific figurative relation between the two: the life of matter is the death of philosophy; the lifelessness of matter is the life of philosophy. The force of the chiasmus compels the reading of a narrative into the relation between matter (or natural law) and philosophy, which gives the "lifelessness" of matter a more personal cast: matter dies, it would appear, so that philosophy can have life. The nega- tivity which mediates between metaphysical and transcendental law is no longer purely conceptual but takes the form of a story: what mediates, here, is a death, a sacrifice of one life in the service of another. This story sounds famil- iar, and can be heard, perhaps, in the original law, when we read that matter only "suffers" [erleiedet] change by means of external causes: when matter suffers death [erleidet den Tod] for philosophy, it mediates between concept and empirical law as Christ's death [das Leiden Christi] mediates between fallen man and God. The mediation of limit-thinking has shifted from a purely negative conceptual structure to a story in which negativity is represented in terms of a death. This figuration is not confined, moreover, to the single instance of the "Observation"; it does not seem, that is, to be simply the effect of a moment of imaginative excess on Kant's part. It was already present, in some sense, in the</page><page sequence="10">26 Yale French Studies passage on "examples" in the "Preface," in which, we recall, it is said that without examples philosophy "gropes, uncertain and trembling, among mean- ingless concepts." The personification of philosophy here-based on the same word, "gropes" [herumtappe], that is used to characterize it in the "Preface" to the second edition of the first Critique-suggests that the relation between philosophy and metaphysics is less like a conceptual relation than like a power relation." The dependence of transcendental philosophy on metaphysics, in the "example," is dramatized as the dependence of a master on the "indispen- sible services [Dienst]" of its servant (in Hegel, notably, Dienst is the word used to describe the function of the slave in the master-slave section, where death will also be a mediating term). The mediation provided by the example must, therefore, be understood in narrative terms. And this narrative is closely linked to the narrative told in the second law, the story of the death of matter for the life of philosophy, or the "falling" which makes possible negative critical self- consciousness. Force is a kind of death, an occurrence in critical thinking which makes possible the mediation of empirical and conceptual thought and which can no longer be understood in purely empirical terms. Force, or death, would appear to be the narrative figure of the mediation provided by the exam- ple, of the relational structure which relates critical knowledge to itself.'2 The problem which metaphysics presents to transcendental philosophy cannot be understood, therefore, in terms of the dependence of the conceptual model on an empirical law outside of it, or the grounding of the "analogy" in an empirical necessity.'3 Dependence, and outsideness or externality, are, as we have seen, understandable only within a narrative that robs them of any purely empirical meaning. The extra "externality" of force, or what seems to threaten purely conceptual thought, must be understood in other terms, as a problem which arises from within the very conceptualization of limitation itself. That is, the example, as the structure of relation, first reflects back upon the concept of relation in the notion of the "limitation" of reason as a relation between the sensible and supersensible realms. The best place to turn in order to try to understand this problem better will thus be the part of the system in which the concept of limitation is most carefully discussed, the section called "On the 11. A similar shift can be found in the Critique of Judgement, in the movement to the "dynam- ical sublime," which begins with the word "power" where one might expect "force." 12. It is thus interesting that "examples" are also called, in the "Preface" to the Foundations, "Fille in concreto." 13. The problem of force in relation to difficulties of closure within the system as a whole is indicated by the last work of Kant, left as a series of fragments at his death, entitled Transition from the Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science to Physics. This work is concerned with the inadequacy of the Foundations to provide a full transition between transcendental concepts and empirical law, leaving open the possibility of a "leap" (Sprung) within the system. The Transition finally hypothesizes an aether to account for force, an odd solution, since this is presumably the sort of hypothesis criticism is meant to avoid. The language of the justification is particularly interest- ing: . . . "without such a principle of the continual excitement of the material world there would be a deathly stillness (die Todesruhe) of elastic forces . .. and a complete standstill of moving forces." (1.310.19). Here, it is force itself that is threatened by a death.</page><page sequence="11">CATHY CARUTH 27 Determination of the Limits of Pure Reason" in Kant's summary of critical philosophy, Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics. It is also here, in the discussion of the concept of the limit, that we will rediscover the figure, or story, of death. The problems raised by the metaphysics-the question of the basis of transcendental thinking in relation to the empirical world-will thus be best addressed by a look at the determination of the "limit." The discussion of the limit-concept is an attempt to explain, precisely, how self-limitation must be understood in terms of a relation, specifically a relation to the supersensible. In an earlier section, Kant had indicated that the necessity of understanding a relation to the supersensible is implied in all rigorous conceptions of empirical knowledge. He calls this other realm to which knowledge is related, implicit in the relation between concepts and empirical law, the "realm of mere ideas." Not surprisingly what necessitates the thinking of these ideas is exemplified here by attractive force: The objects which are given us by experience are in many respects incomprehensi- ble, and many questions to which the law of nature leads us when carried beyond a certain point (though still quite conformably to the laws of nature) admit of no answer. An example is the question: Why do material things attract one another? But if we entirely quit nature or, in pursuing its combinations, exceed all possible experience, and so enter the realm of mere Ideas, we cannot then say that the object is incomprehen- sible.... Although an absolute whole of experience is impossible, the Idea of a whole of knowledge according to principles must impart to our knowledge a kind of unity, that of a system, without which it is nothing but piecework . .14 If we think of the "incomprehensibility" of experience as it is described here in terms of the structure of the metaphysical example, we can see that Kant is concerned with the grounding of the kind of negative knowledge which tran- scendental philosophy provides through its relational thinking. As we saw, the power of the system to establish always only a knowledge of a relation, rather than of an object itself, is expressed in the giving-up, by transcendental philos- ophy, of any full knowledge of attractive force, allowing it to represent only the necessity of the relation of the concept of causality to what is "given" to it empirically. Here, Kant reminds us that this negative relation is itself only made possible in relation to another relation, the concept of the limitation of the sensible by the supersensible. It is this relation, we recall, which says not only that knowledge is limited to the sensible, but that the knowledge of the limitation is itself limited, i.e., is not a full, transparent knowledge of knowl- edge. Here, Kant emphasizes that this final limitation of limitation is precisely what permits the limit-concept to provide a principle of epistemological 14.

The establishment of a relation to supersensible ideas-the kind of thinking Kant calls denken-is what permits critical knowledge to know, rigorously, that it cannot know itself fully. The section on the determination of limits is thus concerned with explain- ing how the concept of the limit establishes a relation to something outside of knowledge. Kant focusses the discussion on the difference between this rela- tional concept and the "mere negations" of Humean skepticism, which is, like all dogmatic (i.e., noncritical) philosophy, still aimed at the direct knowledge of objects, including knowledge itself. Kant thus contrasts the different kinds of negativity in skepticism and criticism in terms of the "boundaries" estab- lished by Hume and the "limits" established by criticism: Our principles, which limit the use of reason to possible experience, might ... become transcendent and the limits of our reason be set up as limits of the possibility of things in themselves (as Hume's Dialogues may illustrate) if a careful critique did not guard the limits of our reason with respect to its empirical use and set a limit to its pretensions.... .. . in all limits [Grenzen] there is something positive (for example, a surface is the limit of corporeal space, and is therefore itself a space; a line is a space, which is the limit of the surface, a point the limit of the line, but always a place in space), but boundaries contain mere negations.... [Tihe question now is, what is the attitude of our reason in this connection of what we know with what we do not, and never shall, know? [There] is an actual connection of a known thing with one quite unknown (and which will always remain so), and though what is unknown should not become in the least more known- which we cannot even hope-yet the concept of this connection must be definite and capable of being rendered distinct.... We must therefore think [denken] an immaterial being, a world of understanding, and a Supreme Being.... But as we can never know [erkennen] these beings of understanding as they are in themselves, that is, as definite, yet must assume them ... we are at least able to think [denken] this connection by means of such concepts as express their relation to the world of sense.'5 The "mere negation" of skepticism, Kant implies in these passages, would claim to know the world as empty of supersensible beings, because it takes the knowledge of its own limits as absolute, that is, because it believes that the knowledge of limits is not itself limited, i.e., is itself supersensible. Kant thus implicitly points to a contradiction in skepticism, that in negating all super- sensible knowledge, in claiming to know that we can only know the empirical world, it relies on the supersensible nature of its self-knowledge. The critical insistence on positing a relation to the supersensible thus preserves negative 15.

The word "concepts" in the last line refers here strictly speaking to the ideas of "thinking" rather than the concepts of "knowing."</page><page sequence="13">CATHY CARUTH 29 self-knowledge from erroneously attributing a supersensible status to itself. It maintains a completely rigorous negativity precisely bypositing or "thinking" a relation to the supersensible, rather than claiming to know either the pres- ence or absence of this supersensible world. The "thinking" of the relation thus remains, primarily, self-reflexive, because what it says is only that self- knowledge must limit itself in a certain way. It says, that is, that criticism can know where its knowledge of knowledge stops-it can know the difference between knowing and thinking. It is the rigor of this distinction which permits the negativity of limit-knowledge to produce a closed and systematic philosophy. The question Kant insists must be answered, however, is preciselyhowwe can conceive of a relation which is "thought" rather than known. Kant's dis- cussion of this problem will center, again, on a debate with Hume, concerning one specific question: whether or not "God," as a supersensible being, can be thought in a fully critical (i.e., relational) manner. Hume has insisted, Kant says, that God can only be thought "anthropomorphically, " i.e., by a transfer of qualities from the sensible world (specifically, understanding), and hence only erroneously, as a fiction of a supersensible being which is in fact thought entirely in sensible terms. For this reason Hume denies any truth to this repre- sentation. The skeptical "negation," Kant implies, thus rests on the belief that the representation of God is the attempt to know a supersensible object. Kant argues for another kind of representation: ... we stop at this limit [of experience] if we limit our judgment merely to the relation which the world may have to a Being whose very concept lies beyond all the knowledge which we can attain within the world. For we then do not attribute to the Supreme Being any of the properties in themselves by which we present objects of experience, and thereby avoid dogmatic anthropomorphism, but we attribute them to the relation of this Being to the world and allow ourselves a symbolical anthropomorphism, which in fact concerns language only and not the object itself. If I say that we are compelled to consider the world as if it were the work of a Supreme Understanding and Will, I really say nothing more than that a watch, a ship, a regiment, bears the same relation to the watchmaker, the shipbuilder, the commanding officer as the world of sense (or whatever constitutes the substratum of this complex of appearances) does to the unknown, which I do not hereby know as it is in itself but as it is for me, that is, in relation to the world of which I am a part. [Prolegomena, 105-06] Criticism, Kant suggests, permits a different way of representing God, which is not an attempt to know the supersensible, but only a relation to it. The sym- bolic anthropomorphism does not know, but, Kant implies, only thinks God. The difference between skepticism, the most advanced of precritical philoso- phies, and criticism, thus comes down to a difference between two concep- tions of anthropomorphism: dogmatic and symbolic. With this distinction, Kant rests the entire weight of the critical system-the full rigor of negative thinking-upon the capacity for a certain kind of figuration. Or rather, upon</page><page sequence="14">30 Yale French Studies the capacity of criticism to know this figuration, i.e., to distinguish between the dogmatic and symbolic anthropomorphism, or to define the symbol rigorously and completely. Since the symbol is, ultimately, the form in which thinking as such takes place, the definition of the symbol will amount to the definition of the distinction between knowing and thinking, and will thus constitute the most rigorous form of critical self-knowledge. What is most significant in the definition of the symbolic anthropomor- phism is its self-reflexive capacity, made possible by its purely relational char- acter. Where the dogmatic anthropomorphism transfers properties from the world of sense to God, Kant says, the symbolic anthropomorphism transfers only relations. The symbol does not claim to know God, but only something about our relation to this being. Since the knowledge of relation is, however, always a knowledge of knowledge, the symbolic representation of the super- sensible will also be a reflection on the very establishing of the symbol, a symbol of symbolic thinking. To think a symbolic relation is thus to represent the supersensible in terms of the very act of thinking which makes this repre- sentation possible. The symbol, that is, always remembers that it is, only, a symbol. It knows, one could say, that it posits. The symbol thus mediates between thinking and knowing, or the negativity of knowledge and the knowl- edge of that negativity. It is this self-mediation which gives rise to the pos- sibility for criticism to distinguish itself over against skepticism, to dis- tinguish between what is and what isn't a symbol. In the symbol, criticism first knows itself as what knows the difference between knowing and thinking. All other points of articulation in the system, such as the exemplary structure, in which concepts reflect systematically on their own relation to their sensible objects, refer back to and are grounded upon this knowledge of thinking made possible by the symbol. In defining the rigorous negativity of symbolic representation, however, Kant does not confine himself to a discussion of knowledge, but introduces another term as well, "language" (die Sprache): the symbolic anthropomor- phism, he says, "in fact concerns language only and not the object itself." The symbol, that is, reminds us not only that it is given by thought, but that it is given by language. It is not entirely clear what it means, here, to concern "language only," since the relation between the knowing/thinking distinction and language has not been defined. It would appear however that the introduc- tion of this term indicates that the knowledge of the symbol cannot be con- tained completely by the terminology of thought. The thinking of the symbol has put a certain pressure on the critical argument that compels it to change its terms. At this point, the burden of the argument shifts from the attempt of critical thinking to know itself fully, to the attempt of critical language to represent itself adequately. The unity of philosophy as a discursive science rests entirely upon the possibility of this achievement. The attempt to represent the symbol adequately produces a reformulation</page><page sequence="15">CATHY CARUTH 31 of the definition, in the next paragraph of the section, in terms of analogy: "Such a cognition is one of analogy and does not signify (as is commonly understood) an imperfect similarity of two things, but a perfect similarity between two quite dissimilar things" (Prolegomena, 106). The concept of the analogy presumably represents the relational character, the self-reflexive ca- pacity, of the symbol which has just been defined in the previous paragraphs. But the reformulation of the definition in terms of analogy brings with it new examples as well, as if the examples which have just been provided were not fully adequate. These examples are given in a footnote: There is, for example, an analogy between the juridical relation of human actions and the mechanical relation of moving forces.... Here right and moving force are quite dissimilar things, but in their relation there is complete similarity.... By means of such an analogy, I can obtain a notion of things which are absolutely unknown to me. For instance, as the promotion of the welfare of children (=a) is to the love of parents (=b), so the welfare of the human species (=c) is to that unknown character in God (=X), which we call love; not as if it had the least similarity to any human inclination, but because we can suppose its relation to the world to be similar to that which things of the world bear one another. But the concept of relation in this case is a mere category, namely, the concept of cause, which has nothing to do with sensibility. [Prolegomena, 106, fn. 1.] These examples differ from those in the main text in an interesting way: they are both linked closely to the categories which bind transcendental philosophy to metaphysics, i.e., to the "analogies" which are linked to the three laws of motion. Thus they would appear to have a special status, a privileged place in the linkages which make up the system: they seem to correspond directly to the exemplary structure which Kant finds so "remarkable" and which is also so troubling for the system. This would be the case, in particular, for the symbol which represents God's relation to man in terms of "love," since this is based on the concept of causality, and is thus the symbolic correlate of the example of inertia. The special status of this particular analogy in representing the symbol links the "remarkable" quality of the metaphysical example with the concept of analogy by which the self-reflexivity of symbolic language is represented. The narrative that emerges in the discussion of the law of inertia would thus seem to point to this extra symbol in the footnote, the symbol of God's love. The privileged place of this symbol seems to be represented, moreover, by its particular term of comparison, "love," since love would appear to be the relation par excellence, in particular the love of a parent for a child. Yet the analogy remains somewhat unclear, because it is not so much the feeling of love that represents God's relation to man, but the causality of love, the causal relation of parental love to the child's welfare. Of all symbols to exemplify a causal analogy, love does not seem to be the most obvious. The impact of the</page><page sequence="16">32 Yale French Studies figure of love in the symbol does not seem congruent, that is, with its strictly conceptual function as a relation of causality. As was the case in the example of inertia, the symbol of love seems to say more than the causal analogy suggests. Kant indeed came back to this symbol ten years later in Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone. Here again, he discusses the necessity of repre- senting supersensible ideas in sensible form, or "the personified idea of the good principle." In a footnote to the section with this title he writes: It is indeed a limitation of human reason, and one which is ever inseparable from it, that we can conceive of no considerable moral worth in the actions of a personal being without representing that person, or his manifestation, in human guise. This is not to assert that such worth is in itself [kat'alethein] so conditioned, but merely that we must always resort to some analogy to natural existences to render supersensible qualities intelligible to ourselves.... The Scriptures too accommodate themselves to this mode of representation when, in order to make us comprehend the degree of God's love for the human race, they ascribe to Him the very highest sacrifice which a loving being can make, a sacrifice performed in order that even those who are unworthy may be made happy ("For God so loved the world . . ."); though we cannot indeed rationally conceive how an all-sufficient Being could sacrifice a part of what belongs to His state of bliss or rob Himself of a possession. Such is the schematism of analogy, with which (as a means of explanation) we cannot dispense. But to transform it into a schematism of objective determination (for the extension of our knowledge) is anthropomorphism, which has, from the moral point of view (in religion), most injurious consequences.16 The "schematism of analogy" which Kant attributes to Scripture here is an extension of the analogy discussed in the Prolegomena: there, God is repre- sented symbolically by comparing his relation to man with the loving relation of parent and child; here, God's love for man is further represented in terms of the specific means by which this love is responsible for man's welfare (i.e., how God's love makes man "happy"). The analogy here, that is, explains the specif- ic application of the causal category in the symbolic love-relation. This causal efficacy of parental love is represented in terms of the operation of the sacrifice. It is God's sacrifice that permits "even the unworthiest" of men to be made happy, i.e., to be "saved." It is thus the specific structure of a sacrificial relation which permits the creation of the symbolic analogy between the phenomenal causal relation and the relation to the nonphenomenal being. That is, the structure of the symbol as a symbol of symbol is linked, not to any causal relation, but specifically to the sacrificial one. God's "love" has a privileged status as a symbol because it is defined by this structure. The appropriateness of the sacrificial structure as the privileged symbol would seem to lie in its representation of the negative character of symbolic self-knowledge: the sacrifice is a loss suffered in the service of a gain. In its broadest outlines in the footnote, this relation appears to be the loss suffered by 16. Immanuel Kant, Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone, trans. T. M. Greene and H. H. Hudson (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1960), 58.</page><page sequence="17">CATHY CARUTH 33 God, "robbing himself" of a possession, or sacrificing "part of his state of bliss, " in order for man to be made "happy, " or to achieve his own state of bliss. The sacrifice thus establishes a relation between God and man that is struc- tured like a chiasmus, or an inverted analogy in which God and man exchange the properties of bliss and unhappiness through the agency of the sacrifice. Put in terms of the parent-child relationship of the earlier analogy, the chiasmus would appear as follows: Parent's bliss Parent's unhappiness Child's unhappiness Child's bliss This figure represents the negative relation between man and God (the bliss of one is the unhappiness of the other) as the principle of the unity between them. The symbol thus represents its own negativity in terms of a loss of the knowl- edge of God regained as the knowledge of the mere thinking of God, i.e., the knowledge of the limit. If we examine the footnote carefully, however, the notion of the sacrifice does not appear to be entirely straightforward. The passage which Kant cites from the Gospel of John reminds us that the loving sacrifice for the human child also involves another parent-child relationship: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.'7 God's loving relation to man as his child depends on a relation to another child, the only true child. The parental relationship between God and man is medi- ated through the parental relationship between God and Christ. But in this mediating relation, the "sacrifice" is not the sacrifice by the parent but rather of the child: in sending his true son into the world so that the world might be saved "through" him, God is sending his first son to his death. The loving relation between parent and child now depends upon a relation in which the parent sends another child to its death: man is only related to God as the beloved child by being the second, foster child, the one that comes after the first child is eliminated. If "parent and child" represent the two-term rela- tionship par excellence, the introduction of the Christ story suggests that there is an extra child somewhere that had to be eliminated in order for parental love to be established. The balance of the four terms of the analogy, or of the two relations, depends on the suppression of another relation which makes the establishment of the analogy possible in the first place. This other relation creates an imbalance which can be thought of in terms of the chiasmic structure of the sacrifice. The extra child, or rather the death of 17. John, 3, 16-17, King James version.</page><page sequence="18">34 Yale French Studies the extra child, creates an asymmetry in this structure, which must be refor- mulated now not in terms of bliss and unhappiness but in terms of life and death: Parent's life Other child's death Child's death Child's life The appearance of the other child's death in the analogy displaces the sacrifice from its position between the terms "God" and "man" to a position "outside" of them, where it cannot be considered an act of either of them. Similarly, the agent of this "death, " or the other child, since it appears only in function of its death, cannot be considered a child in any understandable sense of the word (one could say that Christ, in so far as he appears here only as a child to be sacrificed for the parental love of man, is already dead, and hence not a "be- loved" child from the beginning). The other relations within the analogy are thus placed in relation to an "event" which cannot be understood as either sensible or supersensible, an act or property of man or of God. The negativity of this other relation-represented as death-thus remains incomprehensible, since it cannot be properly associated with either term: for man, it is God's death, for God, it is Christ's death. This other relation is not, therefore, com- prehensible in terms of any kind of thought or knowable difference. If God's relation to the living child becomes comprehensible through the relation to the dead one, the latter cannot be considered a "relation" in any known sense of the term. The other's death, as it were, holds a place for man in the analogy, it opens up the relation in which a place will be reserved for man, even as it closes off the complete understanding of itself as a comprehensible event.18 This imbalance within the symbolic analogy, which both permits it to work, and makes its complete self-closure impossible, indicates the impos- sibility for the symbol to represent itself adequately as language. What remains after the symbol has symbolized itself is always another term that is not con- tained within the symbolic structure. Thus the examples of the symbol given in the main text of the Prolegomena produce the examples in the footnote, and these generate other examples in other texts. The movement from symbol to symbol marks the excess of the language of the system in relation to its concep- tualization, or the excessiveness of language as occurrence in relation to its self-representation. The division between thinking and knowing in the sys- tem, which takes the form of a self-closing structure, might thus be considered a displacement of the difference between event and representation in language, a difference that does not permit systematization as a structure. The attempt to contain this difference, this lag between the event and its representation, 18. The place of Christ in these examples has implications for the traditional understanding of the Christ story as a meaningful redemption of Abraham's sacrifice. Kierkegaard's version of the Abraham story in Fear and Trembling is relevant in this context. For a reading of Kierkegaard see Kevin Newmark, "Between Hegel and Kierkegaard: The Space of Translation," Genre 16 (Winter 1983).</page><page sequence="19">CATHY CARUTH 35 would produce, within the structure of the division between knowing and thinking, the narratives that emerge at points of articulation within the sys- tem. Thus, while the parent-child analogy in the first symbol of love is under- standable in terms of a structure of comparison, the introduction of the Christ child is possible only through a narrative, a relation between a "first" and a "second" child, a life and a death that has already taken place. The temporal ordering of this narrative would attempt to contain the difference that cannot be systematized in conceptual structures. Like the narrative that appears in the metaphysical part of the system, this narrative exceeds the conceptual struc- ture of the critical argument. But its emergence in the symbol indicates that the temporality of the narrative does not derive from an empirical model. The story that emerges at the joints of the system tells of the impossibility for the language of the system to close upon itself in its representation, a nonclosure that appears as the irrevocable "priority" of an event. We might think of this nonclosure in terms of the difference between the symbol and its concept, or the symbol and its representation as an analogy. If the symbol represents the thinking of the relation of the sensible to the super- sensible, the concept of the symbol-the definition of the symbol in critical discourse-enacts a kind of positing that cannot be recuperated symbolically. This nonrecuperation would be marked by the proliferation of examples, not "empirical" examples, but examples in the argument, linguistic examples, which would always eventually take the form of a narrative. The concept of the limit which structures the system would thus be made possible by the symbol and impossible by its concept. The articulation of parts of the system by the symbol would be made possible and impossible by the disarticulation of the symbol with itself. The limit, we might say then, is divided between the structure which the symbol symbolizes, and the story which its example tells. 19 We recognize this story, moreover, in the metaphysical example. If we reexamine the exemplary relation between transcendental philosophy and metaphysics in terms of the workings of the symbol, the narrative which emerges in the former-the death of matter for philosophy-appears to retell, or repeat, the symbolic sacrifice. Force, or the conceptualization of motion as continually falling, must be read not only in reference to a scientific calcula- tion, but also in reference to the "fall" narrated in the symbol. But this latter reference is not a purely conceptual foundation of the example in the symbol, or the exemplary structure of empirical knowledge in limit-knowledge; for the "death" in this story is not part of a system of conceptualized relations. Rather, 19. One might need also to reread the relation to "Hume" in the argument which defines the symbolic anthropomorphism as "not" a negation. What exactly is the status of this "not"? This would lead as well to a reconsideration of the role of "error" in general in the understanding of the "ideas": unlike empirical concepts, the ideas are first "given" not from something outside of reason (sensible or supersensible) but in error, i.e., the texts of previous metaphysics. The relation between knowing and thinking is thus not just a difference between a relation to the sensible and the supersensible, but between a relation to the sensible and to texts.</page><page sequence="20">36 Yale French Studies the "death" of matter, as the event of "force," re-marks the event in the self- symbolization of the system which founds and yet also exceeds its own knowl- edge. The enigmatic externality of the event called "force," its exemplary position as an empirical example, marks an event that occurs, not in the em- pirical world, but "in" the system itself as language. The threat of the meta- physical example, that the conceptual system might be determined by some- thing outside of it, is not therefore a threat that comes from the empirical world. In other words, the externality upon which the system relies is to a certain extent only figured by the empirical world. The narrative that emerges in this figuration says very little indeed about the empirical world as such, and a good deal about the "externality" of the system to itself.20 The "remarkable" quality of the metaphysical example, in particular the example of inertia thus lies in its double relation to physical science on the one hand, and to the symbol on the other. While on the one hand the example of inertia exemplifies the articulation between the discursive science of philoso- phy and the laws of the empirical world, on the other hand it tells of a disar- ticulation of the discursive system with itself in the symbol. The relation between philosophy and empirical science is thus disrupted by the relation between the symbol and the example, a relation which would be akin to the relation between the different linguistic examples of the symbol in the text of the Prolegomena and its footnotes. The empirical example becomes, in this context, yet another linguistic example of a symbol. It tells less about the relation between discursive and nondiscursive knowledge than about the im- possible relation of discursive knowledge with itself. This double aspect of the exemplary-symbolic structure sheds some light on the split between "experience" and "empirical science" in Kant's system. For if "empirical science" refers to observation and mathematics, "experi- ence" refers first of all to a philosophical vocabulary, the vocabulary of em- pirical philosophy (and in particular that of Hume). "Experience" is not a concept derived from empirical observation but a figure generated by discur- sive arguments to supplement their own self-representation. "Experience" thus functions as the linguistic example that always accompanies the em- pirical example. One could thus say that no matter how much it wants to, and indeed does refer to empirical law, a discursive text must also say "experi- ence." And in saying that, it has left the empirical realm altogether and is telling the same old story of love and death, a story with neither a purely experiential nor purely spiritual meaning. The impossibility of fully symbolizing itself thus turns philosophical crit- icism into something like a literary criticism. This is not a failure, indeed, but a form of rigor, the rigor that exhibits the necessity and impossibility of linking 20. On the traditional difficulties of linking the verbal and nonverbal sciences see Paul de Man, "The Resistance to Theory," in his The Resistance to Theory (Minneapolis: University of Min- nesota Press, 1986).</page><page sequence="21">CATHY CARUTH 37 the laws of language to the laws of the empirical world, or of achieving system- atic access to a "world" through language. To the extent that all discursive theory is subject to these necessities, the knowledge of theory will always fall into a similar pattern. What nondiscursive theory knows will always be that it cannot know, entirely, what it is: and to this extent its object will always be "linguistic." That is, in Kant's symbolic terms, there can be no falling, in theory, that is not also falling in "love. " And the story of this love is not only a recollection of the world we know, but also a repetition of the event which divides us from it.21 21. Can we not hear, in Kant's claim in the "Doctrine of Method" (quoted above) that philoso- phy and mathematics "go hand in hand" (also in the German text), this very love story?</page></plain_text>
