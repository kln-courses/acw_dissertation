<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Abba Kovner:   The Ritual Function   of His Battle Missives Michal Arbell AbstrAct During the 1948 Israeli War of Independence, Abba Kovner—Holocaust survivor,  Jewish partisan and poet—served as an educational officer in the Givati Brigade,  writing more than 30 battle missives between June 1948 and May 1949. These mis- sives, which were distributed among the soldiers, were a novelty that Kovner intro- duced to the IDF, and their poetic register, expressionist style, high pathos, and blunt  and extremely violent rhetoric put them in stark contrast to all other IDF propaganda  of the time. The missives were immensely popular among Givati Brigade soldiers but  were met with harsh criticism from other quarters in the IDF and from prominent po- litical leaders. Kovner, I argue, persisted in writing his missives in the face of this  opposition because in his eyes they served a necessary and important function.  Through his gory battle missives, Kovner sought to cleanse the fighters of the guilt and  shame of bloodshed and to give words to an unspoken trauma. Keywords: Abba Kovner, battle missives, Givati Brigade, guilt, trauma I n the early hours of June 9, 1948, two days after the surrender of Kibbuts Nitsanim and just before the harsh battles at Gezer and Hill 69, which also ended in the defeat of Israeli forces, the Gi- vati Brigade’s newly arrived educational officer, a Holocaust survivor,  Jewish partisan, and poet named Abba Kovner, wrote his first daf  kravi, or battle missive, entitled “Failure.” It comprised a harsh indict- ment of the defenders of Nitsanim, denouncing them for not fighting  to their last drop of blood and for not defending every inch of terri- tory with their lives. By failing to do so, Kovner claimed, the  surrendering fighters demonstrated to the Egyptian enemy that it  Michal Arbell, “Abba Kovner: The Ritual Function of His Battle Missives,” Jew- ish Social Studies: History, Culture, Society n.s. 18, no. 3 (Spring/Summer 2012):  99–119 </page> <page sequence="2"> was possible to vanquish the defenses of a Jewish settlement within a  matter of hours and undermined the conviction, essential to the mo- [100] rale of every Israeli fighter, that the few are capable of defeating the  many. Toward the conclusion of the missive, Kovner vehemently  Jewish called out, “Better to fall in the trenches of home than to surrender  Social to a murderous invader. To surrender—so long as the body still lives  Studies and the last remaining bullet continues to breathe in its magazine— • ’tis a disgrace! To emerge to the invader’s captivity—’tis a disgrace  Vol. 18 No. 3 and a death!” 1 The missive caused an immediate outrage. It was, in fact, released  with the approval of Brigade Commander Shimon Avidan and his bat- talion commanders. The only issue discussed before its publication was  the title: should it be “Failure” or, more harshly, “Treason”?2 It is impor- tant to remember that the missive was written in a time of crisis; the  defense lines on the southern front were crumbling, the invading  Egyptian forces were advancing on Tel Aviv, and the Givati Brigade suf- fered horrific losses in fierce battles.3 Nevertheless, the missive elicited  poignant criticism from the affronted defenders of Nitsanim. On their  return from captivity in Egypt, they complained that they were being  scapegoated in an effort to cover up the brigade’s own blunders. Mem- bers of the Zionist leadership and the commanding ranks of the Israel  Defense Forces (IDF) also expressed misgivings about the missive’s  message and tone. In May 1949, the military committee that had inves- tigated the affair released its conclusions, both vindicating the Nit- sanim fighters and denying any wrongdoing on the part of the Givati  Brigade’s commanders.4 The committee’s conclusions did not, how- ever, put an end to the debate surrounding the missive. The emotion- ally charged issues of failure, betrayal, blame, and guilt, which framed  the Nitsanim affair, left an indelible mark on Israeli society, and the af- fair is in fact still publicly mentioned from time to time.5  The Nitsanim battle missive has been widely discussed in both aca- demic studies and the popular media, and it will not be addressed any  further here. Instead, I would like to shift the focus of attention to the  30 missives that followed it. They were written in four batches, in close  proximity to the dates of the battles themselves, the first batch in June  1948, before the first ceasefire; the second batch between July 9 and 20,  between the first and the second ceasefires; the third during the battles  in October and November 1948; and the fourth between January and  May 1949, when the brigade had moved from the Negev to the Sharon  region and was charged with halting the Iraqi invasion. These battle  missives were no longer concerned with denouncing surrendering Jew- ish fighters; their rhetorical force was now directed mainly at the  </page> <page sequence="3"> enemy. The distinctive features of the first missive, however, recurred  in the ones that followed. These later missives also displayed an extrem- ist, blunt, and violent rhetoric, rich in pathos, and used a high-flown [101] poetic register. They, too, proved to exert great influence on the sol- diers; and they, too, were met with reservation, criticism, and even Abba Kovner scorn both within the IDF and in the wider public. • The battle missives were a novelty that Kovner introduced to the Michal Arbell IDF. He was the IDF’s first educational officer, and his activity in this  capacity was intensive and wide ranging and had a remarkable effect  on the brigade. Kovner regularly addressed the fighters just before  they left for battle. And despite his oddness, his use of high-flown po- etic language (some of which immigrant soldiers must surely have  found difficult to understand), and the oversized helmet that hung  awkwardly from his head, his words clearly left an impression. Uri Av- neri, a fighter in the Givati Brigade’s Shu‘alei Shimshon,6 relates in a  1953 article that Kovner’s words not only sketched a clear outline of  the ensuing battle and eased soldiers’ anxieties but also instilled in  their hearts a sense of the battle’s great significance: “In your hands,”  Kovner told the soldiers, “you hold the fate of Tel Aviv, of the entire  country.”7 More than 40 years after the war, Avneri still had vivid  memories of how Kovner’s words helped motivate the soldiers to go  out night after night to fight in harsh and bloody battles, drawing on  the staying power and determination that Kovner inspired in them.8 Kovner talked to the soldiers on the eve of battles and at swearing- in ceremonies and rushed to lift the spirits of companies that had  suffered terrible losses. But his duties did not end there. He devoted  himself to the education of immigrant soldiers, finding them adop- tive families in nearby settlements, and was attentive to their special  needs. Kovner also provided the soldiers with cultural events, con- certs and lectures, and entertainment. He founded the Hishatron,  effectively the first military entertainment ensemble in the IDF,  which was headed by the famous singer Yaffa Yarkoni. The effect on  the soldiers was remarkable. Eliyahu Eshel, the brigade’s adjutant,  who at first objected to the establishment of the Hishatron, later  came to recognize its benefits: “the soldiers listened to Kovner and  wept, listened to Yaffa and wept. It was like a prayer, a catharsis. We  always knew many of them would shortly be killed.”9  During the second ceasefire, Kovner organized a parade of the Gi- vati Brigade in Rehovot. It was the first military parade held in Israel,  and it was promptly criticized for its “Bolshevik” and even “Fascist” mili- tarism.10 But Kovner was not deterred. The parade strengthened the  powerful fraternity of fighting men and provided them with public  </page> <page sequence="4"> recognition of their contribution and sacrifice. Kovner’s empathy for  the fighters was deep, and his actions were guided by an understand- [102] ing of their emotional needs. His devoted and unceasing work on  their behalf had a crucial impact on the morale of the brigade. His  Jewish activities—education, welfare, entertainment, indoctrination, cere- Social monies, and more—served above all to instill in each soldier a strong  Studies sense of solidarity.  • This was not a small task. In 1948–49 there were as many as 9,500  Vol. 18 No. 3 soldiers in the Givati Brigade, and it was by far the largest brigade in  the IDF and demographically the most diverse. The soldiers came  from kibbutsim (collectives) and moshavim (cooperative villages), as  well as from cities. Some were born or brought up in pre-state Israel,  and some were new immigrants from Europe, America, North Africa,  and Arab countries. Some were refugees from Europe, recently re- leased from British detention camps in Cyprus; others were volun- teers, Jews and non-Jews, who came to fight the war. Some of the  soldiers were veteran fighters from the British army; some were for- mer members of the Haganah and Etsel paramilitary organizations,  but many others were youngsters with no former military training.11  For all that, Zvi Zur, the second commander of the Givati Brigade’s  54th Battalion and later the IDF chief of staff, had stated that the Gi- vati Brigade, its heterogeneous demography notwithstanding, was  the most cohesive and unified brigade that he had ever encountered  in all his years of service.12  Solidarity between Israeli fighters who had grown up in neighboring  settlements and trained together in the elite units of the Palmah was  expected, as were the bonds between these fighters and their own fami- lies and communities in the surrounding kibbutsim and villages. Yaa- kov Prolov (Perry), the commander of the Givati Brigade’s 52nd  Battalion, described the “outstanding ties” between the brigade and  the neighboring settlements that it defended. At night, civilian volun- teers came to dig trenches so that the soldiers could get some sleep, and  in the morning fathers met with their sons, who then went out to fight.  Volunteers also buried the dead, looked after the wounded, consoled  bereaved relatives, and arranged financial aid for families that had lost  their sole providers.13 The Givati Brigade’s unique achievement was not  in cultivating those preexisting social ties but rather in ensuring that  the new immigrants, as well as the youth from the poor southern neigh- borhood of Tel Aviv, would not be shunned by this tight social group  and could fully partake of the solidarity within the brigade. The  (largely) successful (at least to a certain extent) integration of soldiers  from very different social backgrounds into the brigade was attributed  </page> <page sequence="5"> to Shimon Avidan’s personal charisma and great devotion, which cer- tainly influenced the brigade’s senior and junior commanders.  Kovner’s activity as an educational officer, however, was equally impor- [103] tant. It was Kovner who assured the soldiers that each one of them was  an essential part of the “fighting collective”14 and that their command- Abba Kovner ers, and the brigade as a whole, cared for them, looked after them, and • relied on them. This sense of confidence and comradeship enhanced Michal Arbell the fighters’ loyalty and strengthened their readiness to risk their lives  repeatedly in battle. As Porat notes, this task of uniting Jewish fighters  struck a chord with Kovner: “Kovner’s Vilna ideas about Jews joining  forces and cooperating regardless of origin, language, or political  opinions, were transformed into ‘the fighting collective,’ a term he  coined in the forest.”15 Kovner could not, of course, reach every unit just before it departed  for battle. And so, in order to widen the dissemination of his exhorta- tions, he began to compose battle missives. The missives became im- mensely popular among the soldiers, and, to answer increasing  demand, he translated some of them into Yiddish and several other  languages. The missives were always written at night, both because  Kovner would stay up waiting to hear the news from the front and be- cause he was unable to sleep soundly, for years keeping bunkmates  awake as he screamed in Yiddish in his sleep. Indeed, these missives  carry a sense of urgency that infected the soldiers. As Porat puts it,  The battle pages were dramatic and rhetorical. They exhorted and en- couraged the soldiers to victory in battle, promised that devotion, pa- tience, courage, and brotherhood in battle would, in the end, bear fruit,  praised the commanders and fostered trust in their judgment despite  the first defeats, and reminded them that the key to victory was not the  official estimate of the relative strengths of the forces but rather the  spirit of the individual fighter.16  The missives compared the Egyptian army to the biblical Egyptian op- pressor and the Israeli fighters to the biblical David, who defeated Goli- ath, a stronger and bigger enemy than himself, and to Samson, who did  not hesitate to sacrifice his own life fighting the Philistines on the very  same land on and for which the Givati Brigade was fighting its own bitter  battles. These comparisons between the 1948 war and biblical events, as  well as the call for vengeance in the name of the six million Jews mur- dered in the Holocaust, put the Givati Brigade, in Porat’s words, “into  the perspective of Jewish history”: they “created a continuum of great- ness and heroism; they were part of a war between good and evil.”17  </page> <page sequence="6"> Nothing similar appeared in the IDF’s propaganda of the time.  The literary character of Kovner’s battle missives, and their excited  [104] tone and high-flown rhetoric, stood in stark contrast to the matter-of- fact prose of special daily commands and other military publications  Jewish during the war. Even the most flowery “special commands of the day,”  Social such as the command that named the Moriah Battalion and assigned  Studies it the task of protecting Jerusalem in March 1948,18 lack the dramatic  • power and high literary style of Kovner’s missives; they are more  Vol. 18 No. 3 pompous and less direct and have little in common with the missives’  startling and violent content.  Kovner’s missives make liberal use of literary elements. One of the  most conspicuous features is their dense intertextuality. Reuven Sho- ham points out the numerous allusions to the Bible, to the Hebrew po- etry of Hayim Nahman Bialik and Natan Alterman, to the novels of the  Soviet writers Nikolai Ostrovsky and Alexander Beck, and to the prose  of Ernest Hemingway. Shoham explores further the influence of the  Hebrew poets Shaul Tchernichovsky and Uri Zvi Grinberg on the mis- sives.19 But the missives’ literary nature does not begin or end with these  cases of intertextuality. They oscillate between sober accounts of the  military situation in mundane, matter-of-fact prose, and extravagant,  often poetic rhetoric. Kovner even includes the opening of one of the  missives (dated October 23, 1948), with minor modifications, in his  long poem “Farewell to the South,” published in 1949.20 Another mis- sive, dated October 12, 1948, is a poem constructed of a long quote  from Psalm 18:34–43. Other missives include short poetic passages.  Some of the titles could easily have been used as titles for poems, such  as “Let Not the Tired Heart Betray” (July 19, 1948) or the biblical  “Pitched Between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes-dammim” (October 23,  1948).21 Most of the missives use the kind of expressionist poetics also  found in Kovner’s first long poem, “While Still There is Night,” pub- lished in 1947, which focuses on the experience of a Jewish partisan in  the woods near Vilna.22 Prominent poetic features of the poem—tense  rhythm, created by repeated, distraught outcries that end with excla- mation marks; short, almost severed, sentences; paratactic syntax and  anaphoric repetitions; the use of spread letters for emphasis; nightmar- ish images of personified body parts, weapons, vehicles, buildings,  plants, and forces of nature that operate as independent beings, in  which the partisan appears as a beast’s claw and the enemy as a menac- ing tooth—all of these expressionist elements resurface in the battle  missives. The world that Kovner creates in the missives, like the world  he creates in “While Still There is Night” and in his later long poem,  “Farewell to the South,” is constructed and measured by the “enormous  </page> <page sequence="7"> yardstick of his emotions,” to borrow a phrase from Kasimir Edschmid’s  seminal expressionist manifesto, published in 1919. “This outburst  from inside,” writes Edschmid about the expressionist poet, “relates [105] him to everything.”23 In the missives, the stark shifts between un- adorned reports of battles and “outburst from inside” generate the tur- Abba Kovner bulent, expressionist quality of the text. • The battle missives were set apart from all other IDF propaganda Michal Arbell communications not only by their literary style but also by their ex- treme content and violent rhetoric. They are saturated with blood: the  blood of the defenders, the blood of the enemy soldiers, the blood that  must be avenged, the blood that fertilizes the land, and the biblical  plague of blood that struck the ancient Egyptians. All the missives,  from the second up until the last batch (except the last few missives,  which were written in 1949, after the fighting had ended) open with the  heading “Death to the Invaders!” printed in bold font. Calls for the en- emy’s death also appear in the missives’ text. For example, the missive  “The Plague of Stench” (July 17, 1948) ends with the call: “With a curse,  with a prayer, with love—pull the trigger: Slaughter. Slaughter. Slaugh- ter. And to the invaders there shall be no hope.”24 The missives refer to Egyptian soldiers in dehumanizing meta- phors: they are called “dogs,” “Nile dogs,” “snakes,” “vipers,” “shred- ded snake,” and “dangerous wounded animals” to be slaughtered.  The dead bodies of enemy soldiers are denied the respect conven- tionally accorded human corpses, being referred to instead as beastly  carrion. They become filth, dead meat for vultures to clean off the  earth (October 21, 1948); or the “waste of the invaders’ corpses” that  will “yet fertilize our blooming fields” (July 12, 1948); or reeking, re- pellent, and contaminated feces (July 17, 1948). Kovner ridicules a  bulletin from Radio Cairo announcing that King Farouk had visited  wounded Egyptian soldiers and was pleased by the high spirits of his  noble warriors. Referring to the stench that came from the unburied  corpses of Egyptian soldiers, Kovner calls out to the king:  King Farouk, King Farouk, could you be kind enough to take off your  draping majestic gown, come to the fields of Negba and pick up the  stinking leftovers of those high spirits? They make our lives very diffi- cult—because by now we are used to breathe the clean, fresh, pure air of  our homeland. Kovner concludes: “King Farouk—he won’t come to pick up his feces.”25 Although today such words would likely be condemned as abhor- rent, in Israel in 1948—not many years after World War II, when some  </page> <page sequence="8"> Soviet propaganda took similar lines—they were less obviously outra- geous. Some of the Givati Brigade’s commanders had mixed feelings  [106] about the missives, regarding them as stimulating but problematic and  pompous. But other commanders had nothing but high praise for  Jewish them.26 Nine years after the war, Avidan celebrated Kovner’s capacity to  Social discern precisely the psychological needs of the warriors, as well as his  Studies outstanding writing skills. According to Avidan, Kovner’s much-criti- • cized slogan “Death to the Invaders” was as effective as a whole battal- Vol. 18 No. 3 ion. 27 The brigade’s soldiers, at least the large majority of them, eagerly  anticipated the missives, and the missives’ reputation traveled beyond  the brigade and the IDF.28 Kovner’s rhetoric even had an impact—al- beit limited—on other IDF publications. After the second ceasefire, the  IDF headquarters’ Cultural Department supplemented the matter-of- fact prose of their updates with the concluding exclamation “Death to  the invaders!”29 A more complex example of the missives’ influence can  be found in the “command for the day” (pekudat yom) issued by General  Moshe Carmel, the commander of the north front, on October 31,  1948, celebrating the triumph over Fawzi al-Kaukji’s Arab Liberation  Army in the Galilee. Unlike the IDF’s usual propaganda, Carmel uses  lofty language, rhythmic repetitions, and excited rhetoric, referring to  the enemy as “the savages from the desert” and concluding with a recog- nizably “Kovnerian” exclamation: “Death for those who wished us  dead!! Freedom for the people of Israel and the land!”30 Nevertheless,  Carmel’s text, though certainly flowery and triumphant in its rhetoric,  avoids entirely the more disturbing contents of Kovner’s missives.  Nonetheless, it remains the case that the positive reception of  Kovner’s themes, style, and rhetoric within the IDF was limited and that,  by and large, his battle missives met with scathing criticism. Kovner’s  propaganda dominated an entire meeting of education officers on Au- gust 1, 1948. Kovner was not present and his name was not mentioned in  the meeting’s minutes. The general view was that, although it was neces- sary to use propaganda in order to invigorate the fighters’ spirits, and  although the battle against the invading forces demanded harsher  tones, the Givati missives had crossed the line. One officer remarked  that the missives bordered on sadism and that the Jewish people, who  had felt the blade of slaughter on their own flesh, should not be advocat- ing such slaughter. Others were concerned with the missives’ potential  to render soldiers uncivilized wild beasts; in the future, those soldiers  might become civilians who would permit themselves to commit rape.31  Some officers criticized the missives’ shrill tone and inappropriate use  of slogans coined by the Soviet army in World War II; the soldiers, they  claimed, found the missives’ turns of phrase laughable.32  </page> <page sequence="9"> In the same month, Kovner was summoned to the administrative  officer of the southern front, Ornan Azaryahu (nicknamed Sinai),  who was shocked by the missives. He attributed the teaching of hate [107] that the missives spread to the influence of Soviet World War II pro- paganda and told Kovner that the Egyptians were not Nazis. Kovner Abba Kovner retorted that Azaryahu, who was never a warrior, understood nothing • about fighting—that it is impossible to fight without hate—and de- Michal Arbell clared that he intended to keep writing the missives unless ordered  otherwise by Shimon Avidan. Another meeting between Alon, Az- aryahu, Avidan, and Kovner took place in August 1948. Tensions be- tween the Palmah and the Givati Brigade had risen, and it was evident  that Alon saw eye to eye on this matter with David Ben-Gurion, Isra- el’s prime minister and minister of defense. Nevertheless, Avidan, the  much-admired and willful commander of the Givati Brigade, sup- ported Kovner and rejected the views of Alon—his own com- mander—disregarding the ensuing political fallout.33 The officers  decided that future missives would be approved by Alon before publi- cation, but this decision was never implemented.34  A more consequential rebuke, however, came from Kovner’s own  Ha-shomer Ha-tsa‘ir movement. Kovner knew that members of Ha- shomer Ha-tsa‘ir condemned his missives as “Fascist horror propa- ganda,” and after receiving a letter of rebuke from Meir Ya‘ari, the  leader of Ha-shomer Ha-tsa‘ir, Ha-kibbuts Ha-artsi, and Mapam,  Kovner demanded a meeting in order to resolve the matter. In January  1949, Kovner met with prominent leaders of Ha-shomer Ha-tsa‘ir, who  strongly advised him to stop writing his controversial texts. Kovner was  deeply offended and felt betrayed by his own people.35 This meeting,  however, left a mark on Kovner, and his last missives were indeed writ- ten in a comparatively restrained tone. Calls to “cut off the enemy’s  claws” remain,36 but all in all his 1949 missives are less gory and de- meaning, and some of them emphasize the importance of treating the  Arab villagers and captive Arab soldiers humanely and discourage loot- ing. It should be noted, though, that nearly all heavy fighting had ended  on January 7, 1949. At this point, the Givati Brigade was stationed in  the Sharon region, and the military situation was entirely different  than it had been in the days of Kovner’s more vitriolic missives. Perhaps  Kovner, for all his stubbornness, saw no serious harm in trying to pla- cate the leaders of his movement, the primary threat having passed and  the motivation for teaching hatred significantly lessened.  But why was teaching hatred so important to Kovner in the first  place? What drove him to such extreme rhetoric, no matter the op- position or the fallout? In the years before the 1948 war, Kovner  </page> <page sequence="10"> suffered acutely from the schism between himself and the leadership  of both the Zionist movement and Ha-shomer Ha-tsa‘ir, as a result of  [108] his plan for vengeance after World War II. Keeping that in mind,  Kovner’s readiness to alienate himself again from the country’s lead- Jewish ers, as well as from his movement, seems puzzling. There is no doubt  Social that in his view the missives served an important purpose. But what  Studies was that purpose?  • Kovner’s fellow officers, and later researchers such as Shalom  Vol. 18 No. 3 Lurie, 37 offered two explanations for the missives’ hate-mongering.  One explanation is that Kovner was utterly captivated by Soviet World  War II propaganda. As Lurie notes, Kovner gave one of his missives  (July 13, 1948) the title “Negbagrad,” referring to Stalingrad; an- other title, “Invaders, for whom did the bells toll?” (November 11,  1948), alludes to Hemingway’s antifascist novel, For Whom the Bell  Tolls; and he kept repeating the famous Spanish Civil War slogan non  passarán—“they shall not pass.” According to Dina Porat, however,  Kovner expressly distanced himself from the Soviet politruks’ (politi- cal commissars’) style as soon as he arrived in pre-state Israel.38 An  alternate explanation for his extreme rhetoric is that Kovner chan- neled vengeful feelings, originally directed at the Nazis, toward the  Arabs. Following World War II, Kovner founded a group whose ex- press aim was to kill six million Germans by poisoning the water sup- plies of large German cities. Kovner had arrived in pre-state Israel in  order to rally support for the group and to procure a potent poison  for a more restricted revenge plan, the target of which was detained  SS soldiers. Although he encountered quite a bit of resistance from  Zionist leaders of the Yishuv, including Ha-shomer Ha-tsa‘ir leaders,  Kovner did not abort his mission and was in fact able to get hold of  some poison. He was, however, caught by British authorities while try- ing to sneak out of the country on board a navy ship, disguised as a  British soldier, and had to throw the poison into the sea.39 Are the  battle missives, then, the product of Kovner’s frustrated revenge  plans? As Lurie points out, Kovner calls the Egyptian soldiers kal- gasim (cruel enemy soldiers), a derogatory word commonly used in  reference to the Nazis. In a missive signed by Avidan, Kovner urges  the citizens of Israel, the defenders of the settlements, and the sol- diers of Givati to avenge the death of six million Jews in the Holo- caust by fighting the Egyptian soldiers:  With love. With hate. / For our homes, for the lives of our children, /  and the eyes of eighty generations which are raised towards us, / and  the souls of six million—the souls that did not get to see the day—call  </page> <page sequence="11"> us from the ground: let the great revenge come—let the people of Israel  be free, forever!40 [109] Porat rejects this explanation, too. She claims that although Kovner  equates the Egyptians with the Nazis at various junctures, he also takes Abba Kovner care to distinguish between the two. Nor does he call for indiscrimi- • nate massacre. He beseeches the soldiers in one missive not to harm Michal Arbell captive enemy combatants and in another to avoid looting enemy prop- erty (July 9 and December 5, 1948). His vehement anti-Egyptian rheto- ric notwithstanding, Kovner sees the common Egyptian soldier as a  victim of exploitation by the high command and politicians, members  of the Egyptian upper classes. In the beginning of 1949, as the Givati  Brigade was fighting Iraqi forces in the Arab Triangle region, Kovner  took pains to distinguish the invading army from the local Arab popu- lation, instructing soldiers to treat the Arab villagers decently, as they  were to share the same country in the future.41  Indeed, according to the testimonies of Givati Brigade command- ers, Abba Kovner tried to teach the soldiers to avoid war crimes:  From the first days of war Givati was characterized by its high standards  of behavior. I don’t claim that no one of our men ever looted, but it was  rare. I don’t claim that we never expelled [villagers] and that we always  treated the captives as we should have done, but it seems to me that we  were better than others, and that because of the great efforts taken by  the leading group—Shimon [Avidan], Me’irke [Davidson] and Abba  Kovner—who had high moral values and emphasized the importance of  all that, making sure that the message would be delivered to the  troops.42  Reuven Shoham claims that in Kovner’s long poem on the 1948 war,  “Farewell to the South”—in contrast to the battle missives—there is a  distinct theme of empathy for the Arab villagers and guilt for the  ruin of their villages.43  Porat offers a different explanation for the missives’ extreme rhet- oric. It stems, she argues, from Kovner’s nationalistic views and from  his mental state of acute anxiety during those stressful months:  The War of Independence only helped to distance Kovner from official  Hashomer Hatzair leftist ideology. At the center of his worldview stood  his unequivocal fear and unshakable concern for the continued exis- tence of the Jewish people and the need to defend it. To his general fear,  born during the Holocaust, was added the information, in 1948, that  only a hair’s breadth separated victory from defeat during the War of  </page> <page sequence="12"> Independence and that at the end of May and the beginning of June the  state of Israel was very close to being a brief historical episode.44 [110] Although Kovner was disappointed with Soviet Bolshevism and re- Jewish garded the regime as antisemitic, murderous, and oppressive, it  Social seems likely that he was influenced by the Soviet propaganda of  Studies World War II, especially Ilya Ehrenburg’s articles and columns. Al- • though he did not confuse the Egyptian soldiers with the Nazis, he  Vol. 18 did construct in the missives a coherent narrative connecting the bib- No. 3 lical Pharaoh, the Nazis, and the modern Egyptian army. It is also  probable that Kovner’s agitated state of mind during the heavy bat- tles in the summer and fall of 1948 had an impact on the tone of his  writing. Nevertheless, none of those influences, political views, and  anxieties completely dictated his choices with regard to the missives’  style and contents. Kovner’s writing was guided to a significant extent  by a deliberate and particular choice: he was writing for a certain  purpose, and the striking style and rhetoric of the missives are best  explained in light of that purpose.  Kovner was a prolific writer of pamphlets and educational texts from  very early in his career, when he was a group leader—and later the  head—of the Ha-shomer Ha-tsa‘ir youth movement in Vilna.45 This ac- tivity continued when he was a leader of a Jewish underground group  in the Vilna ghetto. The unique style of Kovner’s battle missives is evi- dent in his famous manifesto from January 1, 1942, originally written  in Yiddish and later translated by Kovner into Hebrew. He states—for  the first time in occupied Europe, and three weeks before the “final so- lution to the Jewish question” was presented in the Wannsee Confer- ence in Berlin—that the killing of the Jews by the Germans is not  sporadic but part of a concerted and systematic plan to annihilate all  the Jews in Europe, starting in Lithuania. Kovner concludes by calling  on youth “not to go like lambs to slaughter” and to resist the Nazis. Many of the characteristics of Kovner’s battle missives are already  evident in this early text, including the unique style of Hebrew, the  literary qualities (for example, the ubi sunt [“where are they”] for- mula),46 the excessive use of repetitions, questions and exclamations,  and the admixture of information and agitated prescriptions. More- over, Kovner imports, with some modifications, the penultimate line  of the ghetto manifesto—“Brothers! Better to fall as free fighters  than live at our murderers’ mercy!”—into his first battle missive. As  noted before, the controversial Nitsanim missive builds up to the ex- clamation: “better to fall in the trenches of home than surrender to a  murderous invader.” Nevertheless, there is a substantial point of  </page> <page sequence="13"> difference between the ghetto manifesto and the later battle missives:  the former text is not saturated with blood, nor does it render the  Nazis inhuman; surprisingly enough, it does not teach hatred. [111] It was Soviet propaganda that introduced Kovner to the rhetoric of  hatred that he would use later. In June 1941, immediately after the inva- Abba Kovner sion of Russia by the Nazis, Ilya Ehrenburg started to write his famous • war articles in Russian newspapers. In a time of crisis, during which Michal Arbell three million Soviet soldiers were killed and four million captured,  with the German army advancing toward Moscow, Ehrenburg took it  upon himself to prepare the soldiers for battle mentally. Driven by a  sense of great urgency, Ehrenburg wrote approximately two thousand  articles over four years of fighting. In his eyes, the problem was that So- viet soldiers did not hate their enemy enough. He had to uproot the  soldiers’ misplaced respect for the Germans’ “higher culture” and their  misplaced sense of solidarity with the simple German soldiers, who  were themselves workers or peasants. As Joshua Rubinstein writes, “It  was Ehrenburg’s self-appointed task to shatter these myths and teach  the Red Army how to hate.”47 In the beginning of 1942, with the Ger- mans in control of nearly half of Soviet territory, the desperate Ehren- burg quoted in an article entitled “Kill!” three letters that had been  found on dead German soldiers and that described the enslavement,  systematic starvation, and physical abuse to which captive Russian   soldiers were subjected. Ehrenburg concluded his article with the  dec- laration that the Germans were not human beings and repeated his  command: “Kill!” Ehrenburg made use of bloody imagery and of refer- ences to historical events and to European literature, to the Bible, and  to Greek mythology, although it was clear to him that many of the sol- diers were not familiar with those literary and religious texts: “We will  liberate Kiev. The enemy’s blood will wash the enemy’s footprints. Like  the ancient Phoenix, Kiev will rise from the ashes, young and beautiful.  Sorrow feeds hatred. Hatred strengthens hope.”48 Ehrenburg’s popu- larity and prestige among Soviet fighters, and among the socialist parti- sans near Vilna, was enormous, and Kovner’s later battle missives  undoubtedly show the marks of Ehrenburg’s influence, not only in  their hate-mongering but also in their evocation of history and culture  and in their gory rhetoric. It may be the case that Kovner saw himself as following in the foot- steps of Ehrenburg, whom he met in Vilna in a new historical context  after World War II. Nevertheless, although Kovner was influenced by  Ehrenburg’s writing, he was certainly not copying the style and content  of his articles in an indiscriminate manner. Far from it, Kovner was al- ways his own man, opinionated and stubborn. He appropriated from  </page> <page sequence="14"> Soviet propaganda what he found useful and constructed his own dis- tinctive brand of rhetoric, fit for its own historical context and purpose.  [112] What, then, was the purpose of Kovner’s calls for slaughter? Unlike  Ehrenburg, Kovner was concerned neither with the Israeli soldiers’ re- Jewish spect for the Egyptians nor with their feelings of comradeship toward  Social the enemy’s working-class soldiers. What end does the portrayal of  Studies enemy soldiers as animals and of their corpses as carrion serve? What  • drove Kovner to describe the night of fighting, in a missive entitled  Vol. 18 No. 3 “The Anglo-Farouk Dogs Are under Our Wheels!” (July 14, 1948), as  “the plague of blood”? Why did he conclude the missive with the words:  “And suddenly—the earth grew supple—dead bodies! Dozens of bodies  under their wheels! / The driver recoiled: human beings under our  wheels! Wait. He remembered Negba, Beit-Dars—and ran over! / Do  not recoil, boys: murderous dogs—blood be their lot!”?49  I suggest that the fundamental purpose of this shocking text, and  the purpose of many other of Kovner’s battle missives, was to free the  soldiers of guilt, to purify them, in a ritual manner, from the killing  and the death. In the battle missives, Kovner undertakes a sort of sha- manic role. One of the main activities of shamanism is the exorcism  of evil spirits;50 Kovner became the soldiers’ magician-priest, purging  them of the contamination of bloodshed. The ritual character of the  missives is evident in the stimulating rhetoric, in the hypnotic rhythm,  constructed through repetition and rhyme, and in the language of  oath, which carries an almost bewitching power.  The attribution of a shamanic self-construction to an ardent so- cialist might not be as far-fetched as it seems. In 1956 Kovner traveled  for four months in South America as an emissary for Ha-shomer Ha- tsa‘ir. According to him, the most impressive event in the whole visit  was his participation in a Candomblé religious ritual in a rural area  in northern Brazil. Kovner put this experience into words in his  fourth long poem, “Earth of Sand,” published in 1961. During the  ritual, amidst people with whom he was unable to converse, Kovner  felt a spiritual elation that he had never felt before. The hypnotic, re- petitive roar of drums and the stomp of many dancing feet, without a  word, for long hours, drew Kovner forcefully to the performed “pan- tomime of the soul.”51 Through the collective ecstasy he sensed the  presence of a powerful, intangible entity; and when it was all over, as  he was waking up, his long-dead mother was speaking to him as he  held her in his arms.52 Kovner addressed his task as a purifier of guilt, first and foremost, by  meeting the horror head-on. The battle missives articulate this horror  and set it at the forefront of the stage. In stark contrast to all the other  </page> <page sequence="15"> educational officers of his time, and to the IDF’s propaganda depart- ment, he does not ignore the horrible things that the soldier does, the  horrible things that are done to him, the sights that he sees and the [113] stench that he smells. Kovner pointedly does not construct a wall of  sanitized speech between the soldiers’ traumatic experiences and the Abba Kovner arena of public discourse. If, during hand-to-hand fighting, a soldier • must insert a bayonet into the body of the man in front of him, each Michal Arbell man clearly seeing the eyes of the other, Kovner writes about it (Octo- ber 19, 1948); if the enemy tries to choke him or to bite his throat,  Kovner writes about it (October 21, 1948); if the soldier wades in enemy  blood or if the wheels of his jeep run over enemy corpses, Kovner writes  about it (July 14, 1948); if the brains of his comrade spill on the ground,  Kovner writes about it (November 10, 1948); and if the stench of enemy  corpses is carried through the air, Kovner does not ignore the horrible  stink but writes about it (July 17, 1948).  Following his work with shell-shocked veterans of World War I, Sig- mund Freud realized that the trauma lying at the heart of these sol- diers’ war experiences is unspeakable; it can only be accessed through  repetition.53 Kovner’s first long poem, “While Still There is Night,”  portrays one night in the life of a Jewish partisan in the woods. No  horrors are presented in the poem, and not one death is described.54  In the introduction to the poem, Kovner writes:  And I have told myself: let me try to write all this in a book. Let the story  of the woods rise.   Strange. When I began pondering it—a picture floated, of many vi- sions, and was fixed before my eyes with no order, devoid of the develop- ment of a story. In the absence of progress in walking, paths crisscrossed  each other. The sequence of time was blurred, the strands of the plot  were unwoven—and from the memory of anguish I could extract noth- ing but blotch after blotch.55 This passage may plausibly be interpreted as a reflection on the  expressionist character of “While Still There is Night”; but it is pri- marily a testimony to the difficulty of putting trauma into words. For  Kovner, then, the trauma of the battles in the Negev in 1948 is a re- curring one, and he can—partially, imperfectly, with difficulty—give  words to it as well as to the horrors of the past;56 and it is his expres- sionist poetics that allows him to echo the cry of war. By speaking the  unspeakable, Kovner releases the soldier from his isolated prison of  shameful horror that cannot be spoken of, that must not be spoken  of, that has no place in the outside world. For Kovner, those horrors  of the battlefield are not the abject, the unspeakable residue that  </page> <page sequence="16"> should be quietly separated from the heroic and so-called respect- able aspects of war.  [114] Through the battle missives, Uri Avneri says, “that man with the sad  eyes became a receptacle which absorbed the spirit of the entire bri- Jewish gade, which listened to its heartbeat and expressed its unspoken feel- Social ings in wonderful words, flying and echoing in space.”57 According to  Studies Avneri, Kovner’s missives unified the soldiers into a collective. As Emil  • Durkheim argued, creating, preserving, and reflecting the community  Vol. 18 No. 3 as a cohesive collective is the essential function of ritual activity. 58 Kovner cleanses the guilt of blood with blood—and lots of it. This  is a practice mentioned as early as Heraclitus.59 And, indeed, the bat- tle missives are flooded with blood: “And yet another week. Another  week of momentous efforts. Two days of desperate attempts by the  enemy to tilt the balance in his favor—and in blood, in blood he was  submerged. Instead of occupation, loss upon loss. Instead of a pa- rade, a platform of carcasses” (July 15, 1948).60 “Captives fell into our  hands, some officers among them. Their commander fell. The dep- uty fell. And his officer—taken captive. The enemy will try to realign  itself. Please, Pharaoh’s great-grandsons, please: only in puddles of  blood!” And, “After the attack, the canyon leading to Gal-On was red  with blood.” And yet again: “And if the enemy rises again, the canyon  too will rise and gush with blood” (July 16, 1948).61 Kovner renames  the newly taken Iraq-Suidan police fortress Yoav Tower, after “Yitzhak  ‘Yoav’ Dubno, Negba’s commander, whose brain nourished a defended  land in Israel, his blood quenching the thirst of the homeland’s soil.  And the children of Negba will plant flowers in the mountain” (No- vember 10, 1948).62 The most important accomplishment of the missives, then, is the  articulation of the horrors of war. It is through that very articulation  that the cleansing ritual takes place. But Kovner does not stop there;  he further redeems the soldiers from the stain of bloodshed by stress- ing the justice of their deeds. A strain of ethical reasoning recurs in  the missives—as if to say, “We did not want this war; the enemy rose  against us to annihilate us, foreign forces invaded our territory, and we  had no choice.” A day after the first battle in which Givati Brigade  soldiers had to use their bayonets to fend off Egyptian forces, Kovner  spoke of the horror of the physical struggle, incorporating an altered  segment of a poem by Hayim Nahman Bialik: “You must have hated  us to no end / to turn us into beasts of prey / and the entire nation  shall rise/ and call: revenge!” (October 19, 1948).63 According to this  passage, the Egyptians, in their hate, forced on the Israeli soldiers  beastly behavior: hand-to-hand fighting, stabbing, and biting. For  </page> <page sequence="17"> this offense the fighters shall rightly seek revenge. The guilt incurred  by stabbing a human being to death thus becomes an indictment of  the enemy. In the battle missive of the following day, Kovner—adapt- [115] ing a poem by Natan Alterman and thereby inverting its meaning— repeats what he takes to be the moral justification for bayonet Abba Kovner fighting: “For righteous is the bayonet. And the blood has been let. • Because the vision of reprisal says: Avenge! Avenge!” (October 21, Michal Arbell 1948).64 To this ethical justification Kovner adds a metaphorical one,  perhaps more powerful than the former. If the enemy is considered  to be not human but a lowly animal—a dog—or a dangerous one—a  snake—then killing him is not tantamount to taking a human life. To  step in the blood of the snake, to run over the snake’s corpse, to seek  to rid oneself of the putridity of the snake’s flesh—these are not the  sorts of actions and feelings that transgress the appropriate attitude  of a civilized human being toward the body of the deceased.  The last cleansing ritual concerns the death of comrades. The Gi- vati Brigade’s fighters went out to battle after battle, always returning  without some of their closest friends, bearing the guilt of survival  and, at the same time, fearing that they too might soon fail to return.  Kovner adopted the Soviet—and partisan—custom of naming weap- ons looted from the enemy after fallen members of the brigade. The  missives named the dead of the previous day, described their valor,  and announced which weapons would from then on bear their  names. Thus, the soldier who only the day before saw his friend die  now went out to battle holding the mortar that bore his friend’s  name, reassured that no one was forgotten. Dan Miron argues that “Farewell to the South,” Kovner’s long poem  on the 1948 war, stresses the danger of blurring the distinction be- tween life and death. After the Holocaust and the death of six thou- sand young soldiers in the 1948 war, the sense of grief and guilt  oriented toward the dead must be acknowledged, so that the living  may be properly separated from the dead and the young country em- brace life. In the poem, Kovner uses—and defies—the potent image  of ha-met ha-hay, the walking dead (son, lover, comrade, soldier),  molded by Natan Alterman and much used by the poets and writers of  the 1948 generation. Renouncing the ethos of worshiping the dead,  Kovner concludes his long poem with the dead hero—Dambam—tell- ing his beloved Shlomit not to “touch” his death and not to cling to his  dead body on a “nightly road.”65 In this work, written in the wake of  the war, Kovner the poet addresses the complex need to acknowledge  guilt and grief and to leave the dead on their nightly roads. In the mis- sives, however, written during the crucial and uncertain days of heavy  </page> <page sequence="18"> fighting, Kovner the politruk-shaman takes it upon himself to  cleanse the soldiers from their burden of guilt and grief and summons  [116] the dead, reincarnated as firearms and machines of war, to accom- pany them on their way to battle.
