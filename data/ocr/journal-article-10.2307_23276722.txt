<plain_text><page sequence="1">exhibition preview A Grassfield's Chiefdom Paul Gebauer's Photographs of Kom in the Exhibition "Heroic Africans: Legendary Leaders, Iconic Sculptures" Yaëlle Biro Research undertaken in preparation of the sec tion dedicated to Kom commemorative repre sentations of royal ancestors in the exhibition "Heroic Africans: Legendary Leaders, Iconic Sculptures"1 (see LaGamma, this issue) high lights the richness of the Paul Gebauer archives in the Photo Study Collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and their continued relevance for art historians.2 In "Heroic Africans," great care has been given to the selection and presen tation of a varied and enlightening contextual documentation.3 The gallery devoted to the arts of the Grassfields abounds in such documents, which focus on the personalities of the chiefs, or fon, of the kingdoms of Kom and Mankon: Angwafo III, the present-day fon of Mankon is at the center of excerpts selected from a 2010 documentary, and an ensemble of largely unpub lished photographs of Kom by Paul Gebauer is prominently dis played. The exhibition provides an opportunity to pay particular attention to his lively and intimate portraits of several genera tions of Kom leaders. Images of impressive and imposing archi tectural monuments bring to the foreground the rulers' roles as ambitious patrons of the arts. Complementing the photographs is written documentation that provides a wealth of information on Kom's leadership. In 1977, German-born American anthropologist and Baptist missionary Paul Gebauer (1900-1977) bequeathed his extensive library of field photographs to the Photograph Study Collection (PSC) of the Metropolitan Museum's Department of the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas.4 Living in the Grassfields region of northwestern Cameroon from 1931 to 1961, Gebauer witnessed the remarkable social and political changes that marked the country's transition from colonialism to indepen dence. From this vantage point, he documented the many chief 66 alrlcan arts spring 2012 doms that dominated the political landscape during the period, capturing, through thousands of photographs, field notes, and letters, important aspects of the cultural life of the region. This record is an invaluable source of knowledge on the Grassfields. Gebauer's photographs have appeared on several occasions in the pages of African Arts. In addition to his posthumous book Art of Cameroon (Gebauer 1979), the cross-cutting topics of his articles "Art of Cameroon" (1971a), "Dances of Cameroon" (1971b), "Architecture of Cameroon" (1971c), and "Cameroon Tobacco Pipes" (1972) allowed Gebauer to publish a wide array of photo graphs taken throughout the Grassfields. Looking back at these articles today, it is somewhat surprising that none of them focused more specifically on the chiefdoms that were his strongest area of research, in particular Kom, Bamum, and the Mambila peoples.5 Also surprising is the small number of Gebauer's photographs to have been used and published by other scholars,6 despite the repeatedly acknowledged relevance and quality of this documen tation7 and former PSC curator Virginia-Lee Webb's efforts to make accessible the archival collections Gebauer deposited at the Metropolitan Museum. From his first tour of duty under the auspices of the Ameri can branch of the Cameroon Mission between 1931 and 1934 until his last visits in the 1970s, Gebauer photographed Kom time and again. Unfortunately, most of Gebauer's photographs taken before 1934 were lost in the sinking of the ship that was bringing him back from his first extended stay in the Grassfields.8 When he returned to Cameroon the following year, accompanied by his wife Clara Kratt, he resumed his activities immediately by collect ing field notes and photographs. Paul Gebauer's first rolls of nega tives in the Photo Study Collection depict the Gebauers' arrival in Cameroon by boat and their journey by road to Kom.

It documents in chronologi cal order the Gebauers' arrival at Laikom, the capital of the Kom kingdom, and Claras first introduction to dignitaries. As this sin gle plate of negatives demonstrates, Gebauer was thorough in his photographic documentation of Kom: he captured the kingdoms breathtaking landscape and architecture, scenes of everyday life, sculptural works, and portraits of various dignitaries. During the subsequent decades, a recurrent subject of his pho tographs was the three fons that succeeded one another: Ndi (r. 1926-54), Lob (r. 1954-66), and Nsom (r. 1966-75). The longlast ing and trusted relationship Gebauer built with the peoples of Kom allowed him to take this series of intimate portraits of the chiefdom's leaders. His portraits attest to the sensitive quality of his photography, far removed from a purely documentary style. In the 1940s, Gebauer started shooting with Kodachrome slides, which have preserved a vivid, almost saturated color. They imbue the subject they capture with an extraordinary liveliness and vibrancy. Handwritten notes kept in the Gebauer archives pro vide essential insight on these three rulers. We learn that much of the information Gebauer gathered on Kom's institutions, his tory, and arts were shared with him by Fon Ndi (Fig. 2), whom he describes as an active promoter of the arts.9 Fon Lob (Fig. 3) is described by Gebauer as a ruler whose power was largely reduced by the late 1950s due to the many political revolts that shook the Grassfields at that time.10 Fon Nsom looks toward the camera and firmly holds a prestige pipe of iron and brass (Fig. 4); despite a hint of melancholy, he does not convey the image of a declining king, yet by the time he was enthroned in 1966, the royal power of the fon had diminished even further.13 Due to Gebauers interest in Kom's history, arts, and social organization, several of his manuscript notes on the kingdom's institutions were particularly relevant in the context of "Heroic Africans."14 In notes for a presentation titled "Traditional Systems of Government and Alien Modifications," Gebauer describes in somewhat laconic terms Laikom's mythical origins: Historic Unity: one migration, at one time, from one spot. Myth: Mother Nandong and her three daughters led the migrants from Ndobo to Fumban, to Bamessi, to Nso, to Jottin, to Ajang, to Laikom, assisted by python path.15 Indeed, the legend of Kom's founding is traced to a sacred python whose path led its peoples to the site of Laikom. Follow ing this tradition, the Kom state was informed by the essential precepts of ancestral guidance and matrilineal descent. While the mythical mother Nandong was seen as the founder of the kingdom, Jinabo I (r. 1755-85) was its first ruler. To commemo rate these legendary beginnings and further the longevity of the inaugural reign, the final destination of the python trail in Lai kom became the site where Jinabo I was buried. Marked by an immoveable stone throne, this site, ntul, became the place where his successors were presented and enthroned. A photograph of Ndi, probably dating from the early 1950s, depicts him seated at the revered site (Fig. 5). His legs are covered by a spotted wrap that suggests a leopard pelt, one of the Grassfields' foremost symbols of royalty. The throne is surrounded by other stone symbols: the sacred circle etwi—a circle of stone stelae which is the traditional site of justice—and headstones used as royal grave markers. Other stone markers punctuate Kom's moun tainous landscape. These stone platforms, or lookouts, are large sacred basalt monoliths positioned at strategic elevated locations that allowed the successive fans to survey their kingdom (Figs. 6-7). These photographs, taken in 1937 and 1940, depict Fon Ndi accompanied by an attendant and one of his wives, overlooking Kom's hills from two different lookouts. It is possible to think of the revered landmark of ntul as the prototype referenced in the monumental effigy thrones commis sioned by individual Kom leaders to commemorate their ances tors. The veneration of royal ancestors was among Kom's central institution and these large-as-life presences in wood, painstak ingly decorated with beads and sheets of copper, underscored the continuity between past and present at the especially delicate moment of succession. A prominent focal point of installation rites, their presence affirmed the new fan's legitimacy. The com memorative figures presented in the section dedicated to Kom in "Heroic Africans" pay tribute to two of the kingdom's leaders from the first half of the nineteenth century, Nkwain (r. 1825-40) and Tufoyn (r. ca. 1840-55), as well as their female counterparts, identified as Queen Mothers Nindum and Naya.14 (See also Fig. 13 in LaGamma, this issue.) Throughout the years, Gebauer collected precise information regarding Kom's royal genealogy.15 He was particularly interested spring 2012 african arts</page><page sequence="3">in the personality of Fon Yu due to his fame as a carver. Among the documents he gathered is the following paragraph:16 Fon Yuh. 1868-1012 (spelled Yu or Yu' in official reports) Tradition credits him with the large stool-figures, with the large fig ure-posts I have seen at Laikom, the prosperity of the arts among the Kom people. He must have been a tremendous man, in every respect and the legends have enlarged on his talents. He supervised work shops at Laikom. It is said that he brought Bamum craftsmen to his palace. The traditions he established at Laikom did flourish under Fon Ndi into 1956. Fon Ndi proclaimed the large stool-figures the products of Fon Yu. He and I studied the photographs [of Yu] of the German publications and, also, the frontispiece of Lips' book.17 The similarities between Fon Ndi and the artist in Lips book are startling: facial expressions, height and body.18 Despite the tradition, it appears that what Gebauer describes as "the large stool-figures" predate Yu's reign and were created under his predecessors (La Gamma 2011:140). Yu was neverthe less a talented carver. Gebauer credited the "large figure-posts" as Yu's creations (Fig. 8). Located inside the king's court at the north end of the main public square, they reached thirty feet in height and supported the roof structure. Carved in the round, they featured representations of royal retainers holding buffalo horns filled with palm wine and leopards. Impressed by Laikom's stunning location and complex archi tecture, Gebauer documented repeatedly its impressive public buildings and landscape (Fig. 9). Long passages of his 1971 article dedicated to the architecture of Cameroon are devoted to Lai kom. In his own words, "In the 1930s, Laikom was worth the stiff climb and the exposure to its bitter cold nights, for it was a jewel of architectural daring. Artistic rulers had made it into a show case of towering buildings and a maze of courtyards" (Gebauer i97ic:4ô). Situated at 6,800 feet above sea level, in the heart of Cameroon's Bamenda mountain range, Laikom was strategically positioned at the summit of a challenging ascent that provided natural protection from external enemies. During Yu's reign, Koms capital became a center of innovative architecture. Pyra midal thatched roofs, large courtyards, high ceilings, and mon umental carved house posts were characteristic of architecture promoted by Yu. At left of Figure 9, the royal palaces courtyard and the carved pillars that flank its entrance are easily recogniz able. A photograph of a Kom village (Fig. 10) demonstrates the same architectural model repeated at a smaller scale throughout the confederacy of ten chiefdoms and forty-two villages that the Kom kingdom encompassed by the nineteenth century, a cen tury after the founding of Laikom. Among the large structures Gebauer documented repeatedly is the Manjong clubhouse. In 1937, construction of a new build ing took place on the main square, in front of the clubhouse (Fig. 11). Such labor involved complex logistics and an abundance of materials. Men precisely assembled raffia palm and wood with out nails or bolts to create major structures. Located opposite the royal palace, at the southern end of the public square, the club house hosted the weekly assembly of a society of war veterans. It is distinctive for its rectangular shape and thatched roof held by a row of monumental posts and might have served as a model for the great houses that came to be introduced into the royal compounds. Each carved out of a single piece of wood, nine of the thirteen posts were sculpted with anthropomorphic and zoo morphic elements, evoking famous hunts and battles (Fig. 12). One can identify stylized representations of the sacred python, the earth spider, and the double bells that declared the author ity vested in the officials of the Manjong society. The three bars placed horizontally and vertically expressed the threefold prayer of every man of Kom for progeny, prosperity, and prestige. Gebauer left Cameroon in 1961, but regularly returned for short visits during the following decade. In November 1970, he commented on his latest journey to Kom with a poignant note filled with desolated observations: Nfü, the house of the retainers, is burnt Manjong, the house of the warriors, is burnt The palace and total old core, burnt in i960. The lookout is overgrown, the steps have fallen, the spot illustrates the total neglect of Laikom. The fire of i960 under Fon Lo'o did away with every building of the times of Fon Ndi. Even the palace perished. Reconstruction of a new gate stopped halfway. The walls of the core are fallen. Grass grows over the assembly square. [...] All in all: The glory has departed [...]. The last great ruler, Fon Nsom, rules over a Kingdom that is falling apart.19 This pessimistic note emphasizes the importance of Gebauers photographs of the Grassfields as vital documents that link the great leaders of the past to a more palpable present. In "Heroic Africans" the display of photographs is complemented by excerpts from a 2010 documentary filmed by a team of renowned Euro pean scholars.20 This footage brings to life the ceremonial and courtly etiquette surrounding the persona of Fon Angwafo III in present-day Mankon, a chiefdom neighboring Laikom. The film documents Angwafo's Golden Jubilee in December 2009, which celebrated his fifty years as fon of Mankon. Looking back in the Gebauer archives at a later stage of the exhibition planning, it was no surprise to discover yet another portrait taken by Gebauer rel evant in this context. Probably taken during the 1960s or '70s, this photograph depicts Angwafo III in state attire combining an pres tige garment, a pipe in brass and wood, a decorated flywhisk, and an impressive headdress made of elephant hair that underscores his role as Mankons supreme leader (Fig. 13). Gebauers acute photographic eye combined with his deep knowledge and love of Cameroon and its peoples resulted in unique, emotion-filled photographs that act as invaluable his torical records. Through the lens of his Leica, he captured the glorious days of the kingdom as vividly as the great works of art that survived in Western museums. His photographs are power ful tales of continuity and disruption. Yaëlle Biro is assistant curator for the Arts of Africa at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

For their help in performing the research, printing, framing and hanging the photographs, editing the labels, and creating the graphic designs, I would like to thank Alisa LaGamma, Nicole Cuenot, Ross Day, Mar cie Muscat, Mortimer Lebigre, Robert Sorenson, Rebecca Fifield, and Martin Bansbach. 3 An important ensemble of historical postcards functions as a visual thread throughout the installation; newly created maps punctuate each of the exhibitions eight sections; contemporary photographs by American photographer Phyllis Galembo signify the end of the exhibition. 4 On Gebauer s bequest to the Metropolitan Museum, see Webb 1987a, 1987b, 2006. According to the original acquisition papers dated June 7,1978, the photographic holdings consisted of 972 photographs, 9036 black-and-white 35 mm negatives, and 2409 Koda chrome color slides. Field notes, correspondence, and articles augmented the documentary value of the photo graphs, while the Robert Goldwater Library became the repository of 229 books from Gebauer s extensive library. 5 Virginia-Lee Webb underlined that much of Gebauers accumulated documentation concerns Mam bila, Kom, and Bamum (Webb 1987^78). 6 Among them one can cite, for example, anthro pologist David Zeitlyns (1994) work on Mambila. 7 Cole and Ross (1985) and Vogel (in Gebauer i979:xiv) commented on the visual quality of his pho tographs; Yonker and White underlined on the impor tance of his work and his love of Cameroon (Yonker 1980; White 1977); Webb 1987a, 1987b, and 2006 empha sized the role of the collection as a tool for researchers. 8 Some of these photographs survived and are in the hands of the Gebauer family: Virginia-Lee Webb published a group of black-and-white photographs shot in Kom between 1931 and 1933. See Webb 2006. 9 Letter from Paul Gebauer to Katherine White Reswick in "Kom" folder, Bequest of Paul Gebauer, PSC: "To Kat at Bratenahl (Kom Stool, The Katherine White Reswick Collection), November 3,1969." 10 Genealogy of kings, from an interview with Bobe Nkwain, in "Kom" folder, Bequest of Paul Gebauer, August 1965. 11 Ibid. 12 Among the particularly relevant documents kept in the Gebauer archives are several genealogies of Koms fons, one of which he collected from dignitary Bobe Nkwain, August 1965; detailed presentations on Koms society and system of government; an eyewitness account of Loo's funeral rites provided to Gebauer by William Tayui, a member of the Cameroon Baptist Mis sion; 1972 correspondence between Gebauer and Kom historian Paul N.

In this same letter, Gebauer adds a paragraph regarding the Kom rulers and the arts. "Fon Nkwain worked in iron and wood; Fon Tufoyn was a carver, traditions state; Fon Yuh was a sculptor of fame; Fon Ngam supported the arts as much as his predecessor; Fon Ndi did not carve but promoted Kom arts—from him I gathered a great deal about Kom history, Kom arts, politics, etc." 17 For this photograph, see Fig. 133 in LaGamma 2011. Gebauer refers here to the frontispiece of the book by Julius Lips, The Savage Hits Back (Lips 1937), in which a photograph of Yu in the process of carving a commemorative figure of a princess, now in a private German collection, is reproduced. 18 Letter from Paul Gebauer to Katherine White Reswick in "Kom" folder, Bequest of Paul Gebauer.
