It is the monument recast in contemporary terms by artists working with postmoder means and concepts. As for the criticism concerning the imboko- do, the source lies in the song of protest, and the stones are an African female icon, not an invented or imported one. The imbokodo speak for a different technology, one that departs from the dressed sandstone from which the Union Buildings are constructed. This small female sign now participates in a once white, male, political preserve. A common, everyday object has been transformed by its commemo- rative function. The form, meaning, and placement provide a counterinterpretation to that of the perpendicular monolith speaking for women. But the imbokodo are not the only part of the monument, and the relationships with the other elements expand their meaning. In the dialogue between the imbokodo and the high- tech elements, the polarities of this country might be seen to have found expression. The Monument to the Women of South Africa, despite the controversy, is neither a denial of progress nor a subversion of the monument genre but rather a rethinking of it. The ques- tions then are, Can installation in its postmod- ern guise address issues of commemoration? and Can this way of making avoid the traps of racism that are so firmly embedded in the media and methods of earlier monuments in South Africa? E Rayda Becker winter 2000 ? african arts Last April, as part of "an awareness-raising cam- paign," the International Council of Museums (ICOM) issued a press release, extensively ex- cerpted here, that describes categories of African archaeological artifacts most endangered by loot- ing and theft. Complete information is available at http://www. icom.org/redlist. THE ICOM RED LIST Eight categories of African archaeological ob- jects are under particularly serious threat from looting today. These figure on the ICOM Red List, which aims to inform museums, art deal- ers, and police and customs officials about the systematic theft to which certain types of cul- tural property fall victim. These artifacts are among the cultural property that is the worst affected by looting and theft. They are protected by legislation, banned from export, and may under no cir- cumstances be put on sale. An appeal is there- fore being made to museums, auction houses and collectors to stop buying them. Illicit archaeological excavations in Africa irreparably undermine the historical sources of the continent and those of humankind as a whole. The objects looted in Africa are resold in Europe and in North America. The histori- cal context of the places in which the objects were found is thus wiped out and can never be reconstituted. As a result we will never be able to learn about the civilizations that pro- duced these artworks. The Red List contains objects that are in par- ticularly grave danger, but it is not exhaustive. Every time an archaeological object is put on sale, the question of the legality of its export arises. Nok Terracottas Provenance The Bauchi Plateau, Northern and Central Nigeria, and the regions around Katsina and Sokoto, North-West Nigeria Characteristics The Nok culture covers an extensive area about 500 km long and 170 km wide on the Bauchi Plateau. Terracotta statuettes with common characteristics have been found in more than 20 different sites, Nok being where the first head was discovered in 1928. The towns of Katsina and Sokoto are located at the northwestern end of the region. These are heads (Fig. 1) or whole figurines, mainly human effigies, but occasionally repre- sentations of animals (in most cases snakes). The size may vary, some heads being life-size, whereas other full-length figurines are only a dozen centimeters high. All have been pro- duced in a relatively unrefined clay containing many small stones. 9 LO 0) 0 CY) z 0 0 O i</page><page sequence="2">In most cases, the heads are cylindrical, sometimes conical or spherical. Their main characteristic is the treatment of the eyes, whose lower part is a triangle or half circle, bounded above by an eyebrow formed by a segment of a circle. In many cases, the pupils are represented by round perforations, as are the ears and orifices of the nostrils and mouth. Human figures have elaborate hairstyles, in a shell or braid motif, or if not wear headgear. They are adorned with pearl jewelry. Other terracotta work from the same re- gions has appeared on the art market, and has received the name of "Sokoto" or "Katsina" on the basis of purely formal criteria, after the name of the places where some statues were discovered. At present it is impossible to say whether these items stem from differ- ent cultures. The Urgency of the Situation The objects generally known as Nok are prob- ably of considerable cultural diversity, both in time and geographically. Indeed, while there are traces of the Nok culture from the early 9th century B.C., connected with one of the oldest metallurgical technologies of the conti- nent, this culture has also left traces down to the end of the first millennium of the Christian era. The provenance of items kept in Nigerian museums has been well identified, although their discovery was accidental, and occurred during tin mining or construction work. Yet the official corpus is in no way repre- sentative of the culture as it appears in the art- works now traded on the market. The museums do not own any complete sculp- tures, although these are plentifully available on the art market, but neither located nor identified. Demand from the European and American art markets, combined with specu- lation, leads today to looting of archaeological sites, causing irrevocable destruction and final loss of information. Left: 1.

Substantial numbers of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic sculptures (elephants, rams, etc.) mainly in terracotta, but also in brass, were produced in the region between the 11th and the 15th centuries. Human and animal representations with the same characteristics were also added in high relief on spherical pottery. All these items are known on the market as "Ife art," although they may come from other cities such as Owo. These brass objects (commonly known as "bronze") are strikingly realistic, although they are almost certainly idealized portraits of dead kings or Oni. In most cases, they are iso- lated life-sized heads, sometimes busts broken off, and exceptionally full-length figurines around 50 cm high, crowned and wearing heavy necklaces. Some heads are circled with a diadem, whereas others exhibit perforations around the skull and on occasion on the neck, chin and around the mouth. The terracotta heads are far more numerous and varied (Fig. 2). Their height ranges from 25 cm to close to life-size. Effigies of bodies, whole or fragmented, have also been found else- where. The heads from Owo generally carry headgear in the place of diadems, and many of them are gagged. Some of the faces, whether made of brass or terracotta, carry vertical paral- lel incisions. Alongside these naturalistic fig- ures, some highly abstract human heads were produced. On a cone, a mouth has been gouged out, and eyes are represented in the form of round holes. A number of horn-like excres- cences emerge from the top of the skull. The Urgency of the Situation The policy adopted by the Nigerian authori- ties from 1945 onwards, of keeping the local population informed, has led to the setting up Continued on page 89 I ge t?bee ii j? \2 5' F il l a k' IuI 9. _ L Ih .

But the scarcity value of items now avail- able on the market, combined with rising demand over the last few years, has been an incentive to violence and robbery on a massive scale from Nigerian museums. Between April 1993 and November 1994, some forty items were stolen from the Ife museum. Between May 1993 and May 1997, security staff in the Owo museum were savagely attacked, one killed and others seriously wounded. In the last ten years, dozens of objects of this kind have appeared on the art market in Europe and North America. However, three terracotta heads stolen from the Ile-Ife National Museum were recovered in Paris and restituted to Nigeria in 1996. Stone Statues from Esie Provenance Village of Esie, South-West Nigeria Characteristics Around 800 statues in steatite (soapstone) were found together in the bush near the vil- lage of Esie. Their date is uncertain, and the only thing that can be said with certainty is that they precede their discovery by the fore- bears of the current inhabitants, who moved to the region during the 19th century. The mater- ial used for these realistic human representa- tions, and the fact that they represent a single large collection, make them quite unusual in this part of Africa. 3.

Musee Nation- al de Bamako, Mali. Right: 5. Statue from the Bura system, terracotta. ? Institut de Recherches en Sciences Humaines, Niamey, Niger. These sculptures represent men and women generally seated on stools (Fig. 3) and very occa- sionally kneeling. The figurines sometimes play musical instruments, hold machetes, or have their hands on their knees. The highly elaborat- ed hairstyles are rendered with great accuracy in this soft stone. Some sculptures are decorated with necklaces and bracelets. Statue sizes range from 14 cm to more than 1 meter. The Urgency of the Situation These works constitute an exceptionally large find, this being the largest known collection of African stone sculptures. To protect them, a "House of Images" was built in Esie in 1945. In the 1960s, all the works were photographed and catalogued, and the National Museum of Esie was specially set up in 1970, containing an altar where these statues, endowed with reli- gious significance by the local population who found them, may be worshiped. All Esie statues belong to this Museum, which has now become a target for looters. On 25 March 1993, 13 statues were stolen after the museum's main door was forced and the guards beaten. On 13 May 1995, the museum was once again broken into and the security staff attacked. On this occasion 21 statues disappeared. Terracotta, Bronzes, and Pottery from the Niger Valley Provenance Niger valley, Mali Characteristics These objects come from mounds on the flood plains of the Niger River. They are usually known as Jenne after the name of the town close to the archaeological site of Jenne-Jeno, but are actually found throughout the Niger valley. This site is a national heritage site and is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. These terracotta sculptures, whose height ranges generally from 20 cm to 40 cm, repre- sent mostly human figurines (Fig. 4), often found intact. The human form is represented either kneeling or sitting, with arms crossed over the chest, or hands on thighs, gestures often being asymmetrical. Some horsemen and footmen may have their torsos wound about by a cross belt supporting a quiver. The bodies are smooth or covered with round pastilles, made from fine-grained clay. Pottery, some of which includes anthropomorphic motifs, and metal figurines are also found in this region. Among zoomorphic representations, snakes feature prominently. The shaven-headed human heads some- times wear headgear and are characterized by protruding lips, triangular noses and above all by projecting eyeballs, whose brows are in the form of concentric grooves, and whose eye- lashes are incisions radiating out from the eye. 90 One subgroup stands out. It features longer and cylindrical bodies, smaller eyes not sur- rounded by incisions, as well as a large number of bracelets. These artworks are often classi- fied into styles, from Bankoni and Segou. They come from the Bamako, Segou and Bougouni regions of the south of Mali. The Urgency of the Situation The Musee National of Mali owns all statuettes found during official excavations. The majority of other statuettes known to exist from the Niger valley have been put into circulation by the looting of archaeological sites, 80% or 90% of which have been violated. Very little is there- fore known about the cultures which produced these items, in spite of the very large number of objects now available on the art market. Their exact provenance will remain forever un- known, as also their date. The range of dates which the thermoluminescent examinations can provide is so wide that it leaves unresolved the problem of accurate dating. Given the urgency of the situation, pro- grams to raise awareness among the local pop- ulation have been set up and the authorities are in a position to intervene and seize looted objects, as in Thial in 1990, and more recently in the spring of 1999, in a village close to Jenne. Terracottas, Bronzes, Pottery, and Stone Statuettes from the Bura System Provenance The system of sites of Bura, South-West Niger, East Burkina Faso Characteristics Scientific excavations carried out since 1983 by the Institut de Recherches en Sciences Humaines (I.RS.H.) in Niger brought to light the so-called Bura objects (Fig. 5). These are large terracotta funeral jars, which may be tubular or ovoid in shape, topped by heads, effigies or even horse- men. Also from this region are the stone sculp- tures now available on the art market, a few examples only of which were found during official excavations. The heads of these figurines are generally flat, rectangular or oblong in shape. A large number are scarified, and the busts are often crisscrossed with intertwined pearl-strung shoulder-bands carrying quivers and weapons. Bracelets have been added to the arms. The jars on which these statuettes were fixed are deco- rated with incisions. Some jars form the body itself of the figurines, the upper limbs being represented in relief. The Bura copper-based items accompanying these finds are essentially made of decorative bracelets and arrowheads with upturned ends. The Urgency of the Situation The rigorous methods used in excavation work, both at the surface and in stratigraphic analysis, have enabled information on burials in the Bura system from the 2nd to the 11th centuries to be gathered. It throws light on the meaning of the statues and the particular functions of each site. But once the existence of these ancient cul- tures became public knowledge, particularly in Western countries, widescale looting ensued. A whole network for the illegal export of objects, using neighboring countries among others as channels, has resulted in the massive loss of sculptures. On the Western art market, these have sometimes been "identified" as being from Mali or Burkina Faso. Archaeologists are very alarmed, as all the archaeological sites in the region are systematically looted, and the infor- mation contained in these sites is destroyed.

Sao terracotta. ? Musee National du Tchad. Characteristics In these regions, carved stones are found planted in the ground. These objects are of two types: fu- nerary steles (Fig. 6) and so-called fertility statues. The funerary steles, placed over the tombs of persons who had lived into extreme old age, are made of flat stone, and have two main fea- tures. Some have a rectangular base, the upper part of which has distinctive carved geometri- cal forms. Others are rendered in more human contours, and the upper outline has the round shape of a head. The facial features are carved in slight bas-relief: round eyes, oval nose and slightly open mouth. The lower part is deco- rated with incisions, sometimes representing folded arms in a lozenge shape. These stones are of a very varied size, and some can mea- sure more than a meter. Fertility cult statues evoke a human sil- houette with carved forms for head, arms, stomach and legs. The Urgency of the Situation The funerary steles are placed above tombs generally to mark the presence of the tombs. Hence the discovery of a number of burial grounds under the mounds of soil in which the steles were anchored. Once looted, it is impos- sible to localize the burial grounds and to re- establish the relationship between stolen objects and buried archaeological materials. A significant portion of the information relating to the funerary practices of the population has hence been lost. The thefts of fertility cult stat- ues which took place between 1990 and 1994 in winter 2000 ? atrican arts Oure and Taga were dramatic for the local pop- ulation, who considered them a living part of their cultural heritage. These stone sculptures are extensively and illegally sold in neighboring countries, as the looters have taken full advantage of the absence of regional agreements. In a continent where cultural frontiers are not necessarily synonymous with political borders, cross-bor- der cooperation is absolutely vital. Terracottas from Northern Ghana and the C6te d'Ivoire Provenance Terracottas, Komaland region in the far North of Ghana. Terracottas, Odienn6 region, North- West C6te d'Ivoire. Stone statues, Central and Western C6te d'Ivoire. Characteristics In Ghana and the C6te d'Ivoire, terracotta sculptures have been found in burial mounds on the same latitude. In 1985, excavations by the University of Ghana in the north of the country brought to light the remains of a culture which appears to have flourished from the 14th century to the 18th century. Investigations of burial grounds have brought to light anthropomorphic and zoomorphic sculptures in terracotta, both intact and in fragments. Most of these items are made from a mixture of clay and sand, of dark and granular appearance, although some are in yellow and finely textured earthenware. In most cases these are isolated heads, from 7 cm to 24 cm high, whose base is either broad or pointed (Fig. 7). Whole human figures mea- suring between 14 cm and 55 cm have also been discovered. Some are highly ornate and repre- sent persons in static posture, hands on knees. Others are dressed in clothing with pompons and sleeves, and are armed with daggers. Some effigies are Janus style or bear faces side by side on the same body. This is a special feature of these finds. Animal representations are few but extremely varied. In all of these works, the same details of facial features and ornamentation are worked in high relief. Incisions emphasize beards and ornaments. The eye is globular, rimmed by heavy eyelids in earthen strips. Nostrils and ears are perforated. In the C6te d'Ivoire, the archaeological mate- rial consists of terracotta statuettes of human forms and animals. Fragments of all parts of the body have been found, ranging from heads on tubular necks, to arms decorated with spirally wound bracelets, and hands. In Central and Western C6te d'Ivoire, carved generally oval faces in stone of porous appearance have also been found. The Urgency of the Situation In the year following the first official excava- tions, archaeological sites in Ghana were loot- ed, and the so-called Komaland terracottas appeared in ever-increasing quantity on the art markets of Dakar, Paris and New York. Items from the C6te d'Ivoire are identified as such only by chance discoveries, made dur- ing illegal excavations and left in the Abidjan museum. Nothing is known about the soci- eties that made these objects, and the current extent of looting gives every reason to fear that everything will be destroyed. Sao Terracottas and Bronzes Provenance South of Lake Chad. This culture has a foot- hold in three countries, Northwest Nigeria, the far north of Cameroon and Western Chad. Characteristics These objects (Fig. 8) seem to come from places of worship inside the mounds emerging from the low-lying plain running up to the southern 91</page><page sequence="6">edge of Lake Chad. Zoomorphic items were produced from the 2nd century B.C. onwards; however it is only in the 12th and 13th cen- turies A.D. that large numbers of terracotta anthropomorphic and zoomorphic sculptures, measuring between 1.5 cm and 35 cm high, were produced. These statuettes were found alongside copper alloy items, small human figurines, and more especially many items of jewelry, sometimes adorned with small-scale human heads or animal forms. A number of these human representa- tions are heavily stylized, such as cylindrical busts with eyes perforated through the clay, and a mouth marked by an incision. A spe- cial feature is the horned excrescence on top of the head. Other busts support a simple, flat oval head. Another group of sculptures, which in- clude zoomorphic representations, stylized busts and figurative human statuettes, are characterized by eyes made up of a sphere slit horizontally, and chevron incisions. The b O kS Continuedfrom page 15 rations of the term Barumism create much- needed intellectual space for the seamy side of "serious" educational displays, subtexts that are fraught with irony, play, voyeurism, and the unexpected distortions of often rigid or conventionalized content. Erlmann's essay on the African Choir begins with compelling issues of how nonwhite colonial subjects may seek an imagined, almost talismanic connec- tion with a global ecumene in a politically and culturally disconnected world. He ends, how- ever, with too little said about the choir itself, made up of young black South African men and women who toured Britain and Europe, or about the meanings that can be reasonably inferred from their dress and dramaturgy. Two essays, thematic vignettes from longer biographical works, focus on the activities of exceptional individuals. Peacock's contribu- tion on the Great Farini (born William Leonard Hunt) focuses on how differently the showman conceptualized his display of Zulus, his first foray into African entertainment genres, com- pared to the more sedate and educational exhi- bitions of San people that he produced later in his long and wide-ranging career. Peacock emphasizes the extraordinary life and persona of Farini himself, how he recruited performers and learned about Africa by traveling there, and his role in popularizing images of the Zulu and San with American audiences. Gordon's essay, by contrast, looks at Donald Bain's pet objective: setting up a "Bushman Reserve" from the public impetus he hoped to gain from the exhibition of San people in Johannesburg's Imperial Exhibition. This failed philanthropic project reflects the changed intellectual climate surrounding the display of colonial subjects in the years leading up to the Second World War. The remaining three essays deal with a more difficult and less studied subject: how the African performers lived through and respond- 92 shaven heads of the figurative statuettes are tiny, whereas the lips and chin are prominent. The short arms of the statuettes carry sashes crossed over the bust, and jewelry. Other sculp- tures are hybrid, being made up of a cylindri- cal body mounted by an animal head. Some isolated heads have their faces engraved with circle motifs. The Urgency of the Situation Most of the objects came to light during official excavations and were placed in the custody of Muse6 National du Tchad at N'Jamena. However, a part of this collection was scat- tered in 1979 at a time of political crisis. Since then, looting has also taken place at the site of the archaeological excavations themselves. The cultural authorities reacted by setting up an emergency plan to inform the population about the need to protect their heritage. There has been a special effort to promote the construction of museums by the inhabitants in the regions affected. C ed to the remarkable experience of being people on show. The essays by Green on the six imper- turbable "pygmies" who visited the Queen and Westminster, and lived for a time in Yorkshire; by Killingray and Henderson on the public masquerade and private homosexuality of LoBagola/Lee; and by Parsons on the cross- Atlantic epiphany of a brutalized Taaibosch as "Clicko, the Dancing Bushman" are works of careful scholarship. More important, they pre- sent a rather tricky premise in extremely polit- ically correct times: that within the exploitative structure of the shows, these individuals in their travels may have fueled their own intel- lectual cpriosity and even experienced personal growth. Greene makes this point subtly and provides abundant documentary evidence to support his argument that the six diminutive African men and women had an extremely var- ied impact on the considerable number of peo- ple whom they met and performed for over a number of years, and that in certain circles of both elite and ordinary Britons, they were very well regarded. Parsons makes a similar point in a more candid fashion within the context of Taaibosch's otherwise very brutal life. His description of Taaibosch's later years as a "sideshow artiste" with Ringling Bros. Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus cogently makes room for an alternate voice of "Clicko" as shaman, even within the overlay of structures of imperialism, racist paternalism, and ethnic stereotypes. The case of LoBagola is unique and research is still in progress, but the authors make it very clear that LoBagola's invention of his African persona enabled him to earn a living while enjoying a colorful and cosmopolitan life that would other- wise have been impossible for an American black man in the United States and Britain. These three essays are important and innovative works that balance the discourse on the display of exotic peoples, so that the impact is felt on either side of the stage and the disjuncture of the experience of modernity is shared. [] notes Notes, from page 25 [This article was accepted for publication in October 2000.] 1. Victor Turner, undated and unpublished manuscript, the University of Zambia. 2. Research by historians such as Joseph Miller (1969), archae- ologists including Carlos Ervedosa (1980), and others has also contributed to the body of documentation relevant to the peoples discussed here. 3. Although Jose Redinha in particular (1965, 1974) made major contributions to art history in the region, he focused mainly on collecting and cataloguing pieces, and to some extent describing them. Bastin was concerned with analyzing art styles and types, and identifying specific symbols that she interpreted with the aid of assistants. 4. Besides generally addressing style distinctions among these peoples, Bastin (1982:246-87) discusses a "style of the country of origin" and an "expansion style" meant to distin- guish nineteenth-century court art styles, mainly in figurative sculpture. 5. If one were to survey a number of museum and private col- lections, and published exhibition catalogues, it would appear that Chokwe and related peoples created only a handful of mask types. In fact they have a large repertoire of ancestral mask characters, most of which remain underdocumented. This situation is due in part to collectors' taste for wooden (vs. fiber and resin) examples. Wood is used in a selected number of character types including Pwo, Chihongo (male chiefly ancestor), and a few animals. Similarly, nineteenth-century royal figures have been the subject of several articles, although there is little or no documentation to explain their actual con- text and use. The more schematized hamba ancestral figures, another example, remain grossly understudied. 6. Some Lunda call the female character Mubanda, which also means "woman." Other names are also used. 7. The teeth recall the practice of teeth filing that was favored by the Chokwe. 8. Throughout her career, which spanned more than forty years, Mme. Bastin visited and studied a great number of museum collections, and almost everything Chokwe-related was in one way or another brought to her attention. I focus on her Dundo study here because it solidified the definitions of Pwo styles and meanings that still shape our approach to such masks. 9. For an excellent study of the Dundo museum-Portuguese colonial campaign in Angola, see Porto (1999). Dundo was established by the former Portuguese Companhia de Diamantes de Angola (Portuguese Diamond Company of Angola). 10. The sixty-seven fiber and resin masks apparently did not include any versions of Pwo made in those materials. 11. This defined style is applicable to other Chokwe anthro- pomorphic wooden masks such as Chihongo, the male coun- terpart of Pwo. 12. It is impossible to ascertain whether the Songo-collected example is actually Songo. It may very well have been carved by a Chokwe artist and bought by a Songo client. The oppo- site alternative is also possible, because masks in the same style have been documented among the Chokwe as well as the Songo. 13. Here Bastin applies an earlier definition of a Lunda style of carving (which she considers nonexistent) to the Lwena. 14. Baumann collected a number of pieces that he meant to take to Germany, but because of exportation restrictions they were left at the Dundo museum. He had earlier collected other excellent pieces that are now in Berlin. 15. A zoomorphic wooden sculpture (in my opinion a mask made to be placed atop the head as opposed to the face), excavated in central Angola and (carbon-14) dated to over 1,000 years ago, indicates an artistic tradition that predates the presence of Chokwe-related peoples in the same locale. The fact that zoomorphic masks, documented in the region since the nineteenth century, exhibit similar stylistic traits suggests a continuity that can be traced to an ancient, local model. That Chokwe became the dominant art emissaries does not mean they were the originators of particular art forms, types, and styles. 16. It may be argued that the image represents the illustra- tor's general or interpreted version of what the mask or mask performer actually looked like. However, given the large number of illustrations published by Carvalho, and the degree of detail in all the objects and scenes illustrated, I believe that the illustration is probably accurate. 17. Not all masks show scarification details. None or few scar- ifications often indicate that the character portrayed is a young person-in this case a young woman, or Mwana Pwo. 18. I base this observation on numerous examples I have seen in field performances in Zambia as well as on my study of over two hundred masks (several well documented, in private and museum collections) that are from the men- tioned regions and display similar stylistic traits (Felix &amp; Jordan 1998). 19. This. point is significant because it refutes the idea that more subtle styles are decadent or artistically less accom- plished versions of an older "classic" canon. 20. It certainly is important to document Chokwe styles in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as they may relate to those of neighbors such as the Mbangani, Luluwa, Pende, and others. 21.
