<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ZENO CHAPEL: A PRAYER FOR SALVATION (Plates XXXI-XXXVII) INTRODUCTION The chapel of San Zeno at S. Prassede, Rome, with its decorations in mosaic, opus sedile and marble, is known from inscriptions and literary texts to be the work of Pope Paschal I, 817-24, who built it to house the tomb of his mother, Theodora Episcopa, and to hold the remains of the Early Christian priest, Zeno, and two other martyrs, which he had brought from the Roman catacombs as part of a programme of translation of the relics of the saints.1 The actual burials have disappeared from the Zeno chapel, and the decoration that immediately surrounded them has been destroyed. Nevertheless, the cruciform chapel retains its original opus sedile floor, its marble revetements and sculptures, and the main part of its mosaics, which clothe the main vault and upper walls, as well as the tunnel vaults and lunettes of the three short arms of the cross. There is also a splendid mosaic in the south aisle of S. Prassede above the Zeno chapel door. This study is confined to the figurai elements of the decoration, and ornament will be considered elsewhere. The iconography of these elements is analysed zone by zone, and the programme's iconographic sources within the art of Early Christian Rome and Ravenna, and of Byzantium, is determined. Attention is also given to its origin in the theological ideas of the iconoclast and post-iconoclast periods in the East. The Zeno chapel's importance as the earliest surviving example of a classical Middle-Byzantine decorative programme, as well as its place among the earliest purpose-built funeral chapels with its programme still in place, is discussed. This allows the scriptural and liturgical content of the programme to be related to the function of the building and the purpose of its decoration. I THE MOSAICS OF THE VAULT (Plate XXXIa) The Zeno chapel's vault mosaic is only one in a long series of variations on a compositional formula which was in use from classical antiquity through the lThe carved inscription beneath the outer lintel of the Zeno chapel door which reads TAS- CHALIS PRAESVLIS OPUS DECOR FVLGIT IN AVLA QVOD PIA OPTVLIT VOTA STVDVIT REDDERE DO' is followed by the monogramme of Paschal I.

Some early examples of the motif survive in Rome and Ravenna, others are known from literary sources and drawings. An important Roman example, now lost, but obviously known to Paschal I, was the vault mosaic in the chapel of S. Croce at the Lateran baptistery, on which a cross inside a medallion was held up by standing angels.2 Two other chapels at the baptistery featured an image of the Lamb of God, which was held up by diagonal garlands.3 These models may well have inspired PaschaPs design, but there is one striking difference: in the Zeno chapel Christ takes his human form within the central medallion, in place of the symbolic lamb, cross, or chi-rho. This is the very first example to survive of such a placement of Christ's image, which would later become the normal decoration of the vaults of post-iconoclast Byzantine churches. Moreover, the Zeno chapel Christ antedates the end of iconoclasm in 842 by about a quarter of a century. The evolution of the figurai from the non-figural image is therefore of great interest, as is its origin in doctrines defined at the Church Councils of 692 (the Quinisext) and 787 (the Second Council of Nicaea) . It has been suggested that this shift towards the anthropomorphic image may have occurred in response to the ruling of canon 82 of the Quinisext Council, which required that Christ be shown as a man rather than symbolically as a lamb so as to remind Christians of his sacrifice. To explain the time-lapse between 692 and 817, Beat Brenk maintained that whereas the 82nd canon had been strictly adhered to in the East since its inception, (that is from 692 to the start of iconoclasm in 726), it was unknown in the West until after the Second Council of Nicaea, in which it had played an important part.4 This would bring the theological basis for the innovation at the Zeno chapel significantly closer to 817. However, it has been demonstrated by Nordhagen that as early as the opening years of the eighth century a papal patron did adhere to the ban, and substituted Christ's human form for the Lamb, making a new composition, the 'Adoration of the Cross' out of the earlier 'Adoration of the Lamb'.5 Brenk's theory that Canon 82 had a belated influence in the West, and was directly responsible for the Zeno chapel imagery, is put in jeopardy also by Paschal's other mosaics, which frequently include the symbolic lamb. Three prominent examples occur at S. Prassede, including one in the left lunette of the Zeno chapel itself, (Fig. 10), which makes it impossible to explain the vault mosaic, a few feet away, as an illustration of the newly-discovered 82nd canon. It is more likely that by the ninth century the Quinisext council was no longer really influential, at least in Rome, and that the two formulae were considered to be interchangeable, with the choice depending upon the source of the iconographic model. Thus, where Christ appears as Lamb in Paschal's mosaics, the imagery was borrowed from the Early Christian past; on the other hand, where he appears as Man, as in the vault, the idea 2Giuliano da Sangallo, Vat. Barb. lat. 4424, fol. 33r. 3The decoration of the chapel of St. John the Evangelist survives: a similar scheme at the Baptist s chapel was recorded by Ciampini, Vetera Monimenta, I, 1690, pl.

Although this type of vault image is often loosely referred to by the term Pantocrator, it has recently been proposed that this title should be reserved for the few examples which are actually so inscribed, which, significantly, are later and of widely different iconographic types.6 Whatever the preferred title, the Zeno chapel Tantocrator's' origins must first be sought among the standard medallion images of the Early Christian programmes of Rome and Ravenna, which themselves probably derive ultimately from a pre-iconoclastic icon in Constantinople, perhaps even the one over the Chalke Gate.7 A contemporary source describes the omission of Christ's lower limbs in such images as a way of placing visual emphasis on his divine nature which was retained throughout his earthly life.8 The Zeno chapel figure, being bust-length, is also an example of this overall concept, but differs from the medallion models in other respects. It lacks, for example, the gospel book, the severe expression, and the distinctive hairstyle. The hands, scroll, and expression of the Zeno chapel's Christ are evidence of a different origin. In place of a book, the Christ of the Zeno chapel holds a rolled-up scroll, the scroll of the New Law. His right hand grasps its top end, while his left is hidden behind the laurel wreath frame. This use of both hands to hold the scroll like an 'antique philosopher figure' was discussed by Megaw and Hawkins who found that in the East it was already archaic by the mid-sixth century: by this time there the scroll was normally 'held vertically between the lowered left hand and the knee'.9 This freed the right hand to be raised in the orator's gesture of speech, which would only later be transformed into the blessing. The situation was different in Rome, where the 'archaic' type did not merely survive into the eighth century but continued to be extremely popular. This is proved by the survival there of several examples of this iconography, one of them securely dated to the reign of Pope Zacharias, 741-52,10. All of them show the Christ-child holding the roll in the 'archaic' way. This, then, is the model which is ancestral to the Zeno chapel's Christ, giving it both the scroll and the Child's youthful and mild expression. Is there significance in the choice of such a youthful model for the Zeno vault's Christ? I believe that the choice may reflect ninth-century beliefs about his actual physical appearance. Although Cyril Mango has theorised that there was little interest in producing a physical likeness of the prototype when painting an icon, so 6According to Jane Matthews. J. T.

Epiphanios' descrip- tion of 'the corporeal nature of Christ'12 could be taken for a description of the Zeno chapel image, from which it differs only in some minor details. I therefore propose that the intention of the Zeno chapel programme was to depict Christ's human likeness, and further, that the choice of a youthful Christ holding the scroll of a philosopher, implies an interest in illustrating his teaching role. Placing Christ in the vault-medallion occupied by the Lamb in earlier compositions implies that the anthropomorphic image has the same symbolic content as did the Lamb, namely Christ's sacrifice offered through the incarnation for humanity's salvation. The location also reveals a further level of meaning, for Christ's depiction in the vault which symbolises heaven should be interpretated as a statement of his presence in the realm of God, from which he looks down as if through an oculus. The composition thus contains an orthodox statement about the dual nature of Christ, in which his human nature is represented by the image and his divine nature by the setting. Use of one image and its setting to reveal both the human and the divine nature of Christ in visible form has precedent in the earlier use of paired images of Christ which, in the sixth and seventh centuries, had been applied to the same or closely related objects to suggest his two natures, as defined at the Council of Chalcedon. André Grabar has interpreted these paired images as antimonophysite statements of orthodox belief,13 an overall meaning which also applies in the vault of the Zeno chapel, where the image of Christ risen in glory yet contains references to his ministry on earth and to his passion. Christ's medallion is lifted up into the golden mosaic 'dome of heaven' by four angels who span the chapel's symbolic zones, maintaining a visual link with earth through the marble columns on which they seem to stand. Representatives of an ancient iconographic tradition, they also fulfil the role, newly defined in the hierarchical scheme of 787, of attending on Christ, Lord of the universe. II THE UPPER WALLS (a) The Altar Wall (Plates XXXI*, XXXIIa) The upper wall over the altar, facing the entrance, was the site chosen for the most important theme of the upper wall decoration. This theme, the deesis, is central to the unified decorative scheme of the upper walls of the chapel. The term deesis will be used in its usual sense of 'Christ represented between the Virgin and St. John the 11 Mango, Art of the Byzantine Empire, 149-50. 12See M. Chatzidakis, 'An Encaustic Icon of Christ', Studies in Byzantine Art and Archaeology, London, 1972, 201 and note 15 for text and translation. 13André Grabar, U Iconoclasme byzantin, dossier archéologique, Paris, 1957, 11, uses the Gross of Justin II as a basis for discussion of adjacent use of different images of Christ to express different aspects of his being.</page><page sequence="5">176 GILLIAN MACKIE Baptist,5 with the additional shade of meaning that it is a theme of intercession symbolising Judgment day.14 The figures of the Virgin and of John the Baptist occupy small triangular spaces on either side of the window over the altar. Identifying this composition as a deesis raises a problem: the absence of the central person, Christ, whose usual central position is pre-empted by the emptiness of a window. Various ingenious solutions have been advanced by scholars. M. A. Asmussen has recently suggested that the light streaming through the window symbolises the presence of Christ.15 According to Guglielmo Matthiae the central figure is suppressed, its place being taken by the 'real presence' on the altar below, the Mystical Body of Christ.16 This view is supported by the iconoclast theory of images, which states that ca true image had to be consubstantial with its model' or prototype, and hence 'the only genuine image of Christ was the consecrated bread and wine of the Eucharist.'17 However, in the Zeno chapel, while the figures of Mary and the Baptist are situated on either side of the area above the altar, their gestures and glances are not directed downwards towards it, but upwards and outwards towards Christ in the dome. Clearly, his is the central figure of the deesis composition, to whom the prayers for humanity are addressed.18 This composition also complies with the idea of deesis in the older, Byzantine sense of 'petition,' describing a picture of the Virgin or a saint at prayer. According to Walter deesis was the usual word for petition, used by the church fathers in connection with the need for a mediator in heaven whose role, just like that of an earthly courtier, was to represent a petitioner who was too humble to speak for himself.19 1 he Zeno chapel composition, with its unorthodox layout, is one oí the earliest surviving illustrations of the deesis idea. In fact, it is difficult to find any one, incontestable deesis image, in the sense of prayers for humanity offered before Christ on Judgment day, that dates before 817. The earliest may be at St. Catherine's, Mt. Sinai, where the clipeate images of a man and a woman in the outer corners of the triumphal arch are often referred to as a deesis?0 The subject, which in the Zeno chapel and St. Catherine's displays a non-typical iconography, is to become formalised as a triple image in middle-Byzantine art, where it always represents the last Judgment. There, as here, it is a reminder of the second coming of Christ, when "Christopher Walter, Two Notes on the Deesis,' Revue des Etudes Byzantines, XXVI, Paris, 1968, 311-36. 15Marianne W.

(b) The Lateral Walls The subject of the left (north) wall, (Plates XXXII¿ and c)&gt; is the Roman women martyrs, Práxedis, Pudentiana and Agnes, identified by inscription. On the right wall facing them are three apostles, also identified. John the Evangelist is nearer the altar; Andrew and James occupy the larger space (Plates XXXIIItf and b). Choice of Práxedis and her sister Pudentiana depends on the presence of their relics, which were found by Paschal in the catacombs, transferred to this church on July 20th, 817, as recorded on the marble plaque outside the Zeno chapel door, and interred in the relic room under the high altar.21 Legend identifies them as the daughters or granddaughters of Pudens, with whom Paul lodged on his arrival in Rome. Their Acts tell that they incurred grave dangers by succouring the martyrs, sponging up their blood and preparing their corpses for burial, while escaping martyrdom themselves.22 Paschal's mosaic inscription in the apse of S. Prassede tells how he built and decorated the church, and by placing the bodies of Práxedis and other saints within it, hoped to gain entrance to heaven through their intercession.23 Their relics, then, sanctified this very place: Paschal by placing their images in his mother's funeral chapel invoked their prayers for her soul also. Agnes, one of the most venerated of Roman martyrs, was included because of her connection with the site. From the early eighth century, a monastery dedicated to her stood on the Esquiline hill adjacent to the site of S. Prassede;24 furthermore an oratory of Agnes situated at an Esquiline monastery called Duo Furnas received a gift from Leo III, 795-81 6. 25 The S. Prassede marble slab mentions three chapels at the basilica, dedicated to the Baptist, Zeno and Agnes.26 This chapel of Agnes was probably the Duo Furnas oratory, incorporated into the new monastery, which was known later on as 'SS. Práxedes et Agnes qui appellatur Duas Fumas.'27 The choice of saints John the Evangelist, Andrew and James reflects the order of precedence among the apostles wherever they are listed in the New Testament. Even though there are great variations in the placement of the lesser apostles, Andrew, 21 Where they were found in a marble sarcophagus during Benedict XIII's excavations of 1 729. See E.

In the Zeno chapel, Peter is included on the entrance wall. James and Andrew (Plate XXXIILz) form an abbreviated procession on the south wall, with James in front. They hold sealed scrolls, rather than the crowns of martyrdom which they had earned. They may have been included as the patrons of Jerusalem and Constantinople, in a scheme designed to represent the prayers of the whole and undivided church, which were spoken here on behalf of Theodora. John the Evangelist occupies the triangular portion of the right wall near the altar, and so is physically isolated from James and Andrew, an isolation increased by his golden garments. He alone of all the figures on the upper walls faces away from the altar. He holds a closed, jewelled book upright in his arms: it is not offered to Christ. All the other evangelists are absent from this zone. Since the subject matter of the sanctuary mosaics at S. Prassede is apocalyptic, and the Zeno chapel has a funerary purpose, I believe this book must represent John's Book of Revelation. Significantly, his gaze is directed towards the prepared throne of Christ's second coming on the entrance wall. (c) The Inner Entrance Wall (Plate XXXIIIc) The theme of the witnessing apostles is an old one in Christian art, and the figures of Peter and Paul seem to be derived from the pairs of saints whose figures adorn the upper walls of earlier, centrally-planned monuments. In Rome, the oratory of S. Croce at the Lateran Baptistery, 461-8, is recorded as having had 'the walls between the windows . . . covered with mosaics, representing Peter and Paul, John the Baptist and John the Evangelist, Lawrence and Stephen, James and Philip528 A similar and contemporary decoration, survives in the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia in Ravenna, where there is a pair of unnamed saints on each upper wall. The iconography shows one pair to be Peter and Paul, each of whom gestures with his right hand towards the vault above, as at the Zeno chapel. The similarities in iconography thus include stance, gesture and attributes. It is clear that the Zeno chapel saints follow such a model. The empty throne, above the arch of the window, contains a cushioned seat on which a cross is depicted. After the Peace of the Church, the throne was an imperial attribute which was attached to Christ in his role as ruler of the universe. Early examples of thrones of this sort include the one over the triumphal arch at S. Maria Maggiore, Rome, adjacent to S. Prassede, which is also flanked by Peter and Paul.29 The meaning is confirmed by the well-known text of the Council of Ephesus, 43 1 , which 'congregated under the presidency of Christ our Lord, for on a holy throne lay a venerable Gospel'.30 Thus in Early Christian art, the empty throne represents 28In the words of the sixteenth century Roman antiquarian, O.

In post-iconoclastic Byzantine thought, the empty throne took on an additional shade of meaning, and came to symbolise the throne prepared for Christ's second coming, the etoimasia. This is the preferred meaning in the Zeno chapel, where the whole emphasis of the programme is eschatological. The throne is placed on the inner surface of the chapel's entrance wall, making it the earliest surviving example of last Judgment imagery in this location, which would become the standard site in later programmes such as those of Torcello and S. Angelo in Formis. The Programme of the Upper Zone °f the Chapel The upper zone that includes the vault and the walls of the drum appears, by virtue of its gold background, identical borders, and paradisical green grass and flowers, to represent a unified area of the chapel's decoration, with Paradise as its setting. What then is this zone's overall theme? Klass, who also recognised that the upper area of the chapel formed a single unit, interpreted it as focussed on the throne as celestial altar, around which the saints gather at a 'celestial prototype of the Christian sacrament', with St. John the Evangelist as deacon.32 Apart from the difficulty of orientation if the focal point of the decoration, the 'altar' is situated over the entrance, it seems more likely that the liturgical prototype is related to the chapel's funerary function than to the Mass. It is known that the deesis, with its content 'an evocation of the last Judgment',33 was a frequent theme in the apses of Byzantine funerary chapels after iconoclasm. Therefore it is not surprising to find the same theme, intercession for humanity, above the main 'apse' of the Zeno chapel, which had the known Eastern connection of the congregation of Greek monks which Paschal I has installed a there.34 Indeed, this theme forms the core of the upper zone programme, for it is evident that the abbreviated processions of saints on either side are participating in the prayers for humanity as they are expressed in the proficiscere of the Western burial rite35 or the nekrosimon theotokion of the Eastern:36 liturgical prayers for the dead which are designed to help the departed soul at the hour of judgment, and are represented here in visual form. Peter and Paul, patrons of the Roman church, were also often associated with the deesis in an expanded theme of intercession of eastern origin, the 'great deesis\ 31Ibid, 80. 32Margo Pautler Klass, The Chapel of St. Zeno ™ St. Prassede in Rome.

It therefore seems that the whole upper zone of decoration is best interpreted as an illustration of the theme of intercession which expresses the basic idea of the expanded deesis. This interpretation explains the choice of the holy figures in terms of each one's participation in the actual funeral rite. It is plain that by depicting them here on these walls Paschal intended to ensure their mystical presence in the Zeno chapel as intercessors beside Theodora on Judgment day. The Mosaics of the Three Niches In contrast to the unified composition in the upper part of the chapel, the decorative scheme of each niche is self-contained, though the subject matter of each relates to the funerary purpose of the chapel, and forms an integral part of the programme. Ill THE ALTAR NICHE (Plate XXXIVa) The transfiguration mosaic in this niche follows the synoptic gospels, which describe how Christ, in a brilliant aureole, changed before his followers' eyes from Man to God to Man again. Here, he is accompanied by the prophets Elijah and Moses, and by two of the three apostles mentioned in the texts. There are no inscriptions. Patristic commentary on this event generally dwells on the meaning of Christ's discourse with the apostles, in which he foretells his coming death and resurrection. Pope Leo I, 440-61, for example, saw the transfiguration as 'freeing (the apostles) hearts from the scandal of the Cross', and reconciling them to the necessity of suffering as a prelude to redemption.38 Another even more important commentary on the transfiguration dogma in the context of the Zeno chapel's iconographic programme, is the eschatological interpretation of St. John Chrysostom, 347-407. In his Homily on the Metamor- phosis Chrysostom writes But if we will, we also shall behold Christ, not as they then on the mount, (Tabor), but in far greater brightness . . . For whereas then, to spare His disciples, He discovered so much only of His brightness as they were able to bear; hereafter He shall come in the very glory of the Father . . . For as it is with judges when they judge publicly, even so then likewise all men shall see him sitting . . ,39 Chrysostom continues by describing in some detail how those who merit it will go to heaven, while others will be consigned to torment. 37Mouriki, Iconography, 72, note 118. 38Leo I, Sermon 51, Migne, Patr.

Chrysostom, by contrast, sees the vision on Mt. Tabor as an exact prefiguration of the second coming of Christ, when all will be judged, and the worthy will reach Paradise. This must also be the meaning of the transfiguration panel in the Zeno chapel. Its important, axial position immediately opposite the prepared throne on the inner entrance wall, surely implies a typological connection. Moreover, the transfigura- tion only fits into the overwhelmingly eschatological programme of the chapel if it is seen as a prefiguration, fitted for the weakness of mortal eyes, of the awesome majesty of Christ's return. This visual reference to the theology of Chrysostom, most respected of eastern exegetes and author of the Byzantine liturgy, suggests an eastern hand in the composition of the Zeno chapel's programme, an input which may be explained by its 'Greek' congregation. Interestingly, it is in the East and the Exarchate that the best known monumental versions of the transfiguration occur. These are the apse compositions of S. Apollinare in Classe, Ravenna (c. 549) and of St. Catherine's, Sinai (548-65). Together with a ruined example on the outer east wall of the Basilica Euphrasiana at Porec in Istria (c. 550), they represent a group which may once have been much more extensive.40 The purpose of these images, it has been suggested, was dogmatic propaganda. Their creation coincided with the death of the empress Theodora, a monophysite sympathiser, in the year 548. They might well have been created at statements of orthodox belief in the dual nature of Christ. If this is so, another and more fundamental layer of meaning is suggested by Chrysostom's teachings, and this is that these monumental compositions foretold the second coming of Christ. This would, incidentally, give them a very similar iconographic content to the great series of Roman apse mosaics which, starting with that of SS.

A propaganda message has also been suggested for the early ninth century transfiguration on the triumphal arch at SS. Nereo ed Archilleo, Rome (c. 816). Diega Giunta has proposed that the mosaic illustrates the papal desire to counter the revival of Adoptionism in Visigothic Spain at the end of the eighth century.41 However, despite the close correspondence ot date ot the two surviving Koman transfiguration mosaics, built around 816-17, it seems that the private nature of the 40 Another recorded example, now lost, was in the apse at the Basilica Stephania, Naples, 535-55.

An iconographic peculiarity which has drawn attention to this mosaic, is the uneven green outline which encloses the three central figures. This has sometimes been interpreted as a mandorla. Brenk, for example, chose this feature as the basis for a comparison of the Zeno chapel transfiguration with one from the early ninth- century Chludov psalter (Moscow, State Historical Museum, MS 129) in which Moses and Elijah are depicted standing with Christ inside his mandorla.42 A closer examination of the Zeno chapel mosaic, however, reveals that what appears to be a nimbus around the three figures is actually the rather uneven outline of Mt. Tabor, and is continuous on the left with the mountain's deeper horizontal base. This observation is confirmed by Wilpert's photograph,43 and has been well revealed by the 1987 cleaning of the chapel. The mountain outline includes short, asymetrical contour lines on either side of Christ. These lines have not escaped comment, and have been interpreted as an iconographic device to stress the primacy of Peter.44 In fact, the outline and the contour-lines have little in common with the smooth curve of a mandorla, and probably represent an attempt at naturalism. In this case, both the continuity of the outline and the attempt at contouring suggest that the intention was to locate the scene on Mt. Tabor, as in the texts. The source of the confusion is to be found in early drawings, for example that of the Cassiano Album (e. 1630)45 and Canma's (1846), which was probably based on it. Both show Christ and the prophets inside a perfectly hemispherical mandorla. Baldoria in 1891 described the extremely dirty condition of the mosaics,47 which along with the poor lighting probably explains the error. It is however certain that there is no mandorla and therefore that the prophets cannot stand with Christ inside it. Perhaps the mosaicist intended the mountain outline of Tabor to double as a mandorla. If so, this is without precedent, as indeed is the complete omission of this important icono- graphic element. A second problem which may be solved by the old drawings, is the original position of the third apostle, who is missing from the mosaic. There is insufficient space available below the bust length figure of Christ for a Sinai-type solution, in which the third disciple would be prostrate at Christ's feet. In the Cassiano drawing, part of a kneeling figure is shown on each side of the altar entablature. (Plate XXXVIfl) However, where the original mosaic survives, on the left, it consists only of the contour outline and deeper base of Mt. Tabor in green on gold, and lacks 42Brenk, Bildprogramm, 213-21. 43J. Wilpert, Die Romischen Mosaiken und Malereien der Kirchlichen Bauten vorn IV-XIII Jahrhundert, II, Freiburg, 1917, pl. 114, 1.

On the right, the area beside the entablature is bare of mosaic: possibly an extra figure once existed there, and was used by Cassiano's artist as a model for his symmetrical version. If so, the mosaic followed the usual grouping, with Peter shown on Christ's right, and James and John to his left. IV THE LEFT (NORTH) NICHE (Plate XXXIV* and c) The upper panel in the lunette, with its deer drinking of the waters of Paradise, appears at first glance to be more appropriate to a baptistery than to a funeral chapel, since the opening words of the forty-second psalm, 'As a hart longs for flowing streams, so longs my soul for thee, O God', are accepted as symbolic of the catachumen's thirst for salvation through baptism. Nevertheless the metaphor may equally refer to the soul's longing for Paradise. When, as here, the composition includes the lamb, the reference is to the apocalyptic text, 'then I looked, and lo! on Mt. Zion stood the Lamb', (Rev. 141). In the Zeno chapel Christ the Lamb, the sacrifice for salvation, is presented on the mountain-top standing on a disc like a liturgical paten, a clear reference to the commemoration of his sacrifice in the Eucharist. From the disc flow the four rivers, symbolically equivalent not only to the four Gospels, but also to the baptismal waters. Thus, the resurrected Lamb through his sacrifice is the source of salvation, which is attained through baptism. At baptism, there is a symbolic death of the unregenerate soul, and rebirth 'by water and the spirit'48 into the church, just as death, for the Christian, is thought of as rebirth into eternal life. These are the ideas being expressed in funerary art, when, as at the Zeno chapel, the imagery of deer drinking from flowing streams or overflowing vessels is used in a mausoleum. Although this motif does occasionally occur in a funerary setting, as at the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia in Ravenna, and the catacomb of Pontianus in Rome, it is quite unusual, and one is tempted to see the Ravenna chapel - which shares other iconographic features with S. Zeno - as a possible source for Paschal's imagery in this niche. Below the baptismal scene the panel as it now stands shows the half-length images of four women (Plate XXXI Ve). Lack of a border pattern beneath them, and evidence that each figure has been reset from the neck down, identifies the mosaic as the remnant of a larger composition, which occupied the niche before the insertion of the full-width doorway below. Can this larger composition be reconstructed? The area of restoration involves the lower one-third of the panel. Almost the whole of all four bodies, as well as the lower half of the second face from the left, and the chin of the figure on the extreme right, are within this area. In the upper part of the mosaic the womens' jewels and garments match those worn by other female figures in the chapel, but in the lower area they wear anachronistic front-opening cloaks. The individual on the extreme left is identified by inscription as Theodora 48John 3, 5.</page><page sequence="13">184 GILLIAN MACKIE Episcopa, mother of Paschal I.49 The white veil which completely covers her hair may be the sign of a religious vocation: her other clothing falls within the area of restoration. Her 'square halo' implies that a likeness is intended.50 Although the other women are not named, identification is possible because Paschal's mosaicists created recognisable facial features which were used wherever a certain individual was portrayed, allowing comparison of unnamed figures with the named figures in the chapel.51 The central figure has the features of the deesis virgin, moreover at each shoulder above the restorations there is a dark-blue area continuous with the gold- edged veil over her head. These areas form part of her original garment, a maphorion, with her short gold necklace a remnant of its golden border. The young woman on Mary's left, despite the restored chin, is recognisable as Pudentiana, while to Mary's right the young saint has the pointed chin and broad brow of Práxedis. The equal and open spacing between these three women, which contrasts with the closeness of Práxedis and Theodora, suggests that the three form a group, in which Mary, though she is the same size as her companions, is raised up and has a larger space around her: indications that the original composition included a throne. The restoration pattern that rises up beside Mary's chin on each side, confirms that this throne had a back. Evidently she once held the Christ Child centrally upon her lap, for the distinctive outline of Mary's cloak, which is drawn in to a central gold clasp and then pulls apart again to form a semicircular outline below, follows the former outline of the Child's halo, as if the restorers put the impressions of the original mosaic setting to new use. Obviously the figure of the Child was eliminated because the new lintel cut through the Child's head. The Virgin must have been of the Nikopeia type, with the Child central on her lap and looking straight ahead. This iconography was favoured elsewhere in the patronage of Paschal, who chose it for the medallion over the outer door of the Zeno chapel (Plate XXXV¿), as well as for the main subject of the apse mosaic at S. Maria in Domnica.52 A lost mosaic on the arch at S. Cecilia, known from Cassiano's album, included a central Virgin Nikopeia,53 this a variant in which the Child's arms were flung apart in greeting. The thirteenth century Zeno chapel altar mosaic also features this variant,54 a possible clue to the original iconography of the Virgin and Child in the left niche there. The Cassiano drawing of this niche as it was in the 1630s (Plate XXXVIè) confirms that the mosaic panel was already truncated at that time, but reveals rather surprisingly that the rear wall of the niche was still in place. Its lower third, undecorated, was flush with the upper part of the wall, and was the right size for an antique sarcophagus. Above it, the drawing shows a horseshoe arch filled with 49The inscription horizontally above the halo, EPISCOPA, and vertically on the left, THEODO(RA). The last two letters are missing, being within the area of restoration. ^For meaning of the 'square halo,' see Gerhart Ladner, 'The so-called Square Nimbus', Medieval Studies, 3, 1941, 15-45.

It is plainly the artist's version of a mosaic panel in the back of an arcosolium. The design probably represents acanthus scrolls, as in the side lunetes at the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia. Since this artist always schematised ornament, the horseshoe arch should probably be seen only as an error of proportion. When an exact full-width semicircle is inserted above the tomb area, there is enough room left for the full-length figures of Theodora and the saints to stand beside the enthroned figure of Mary, and this is the reconstruction I propose. Theodora's position beside the saints implies that this mosaic was part of her own funeral monument, and that her sarcophagus did indeed rest in this niche. It also implies that she sought the held and protection of the Virgin and of the Child through the intercession of Práxedis, beside whom she stands. In a similar way Paschal had sought the intervention of the saints on his own behalf at the threshold of Paradise.55 The placement of a portrait of the deceased over the tomb is known elsewhere in ninth century Rome, and so is the use of a 'square halo' to denote a funerary portrait rather than a donor image.56 Nevertheless, the iconographic scheme of which Theodora's funerary portrait formed a part, must have been unusual in its richness and in the fact that it was prepared for a woman. It remains the sole location where a well-preserved portrait of a woman with a square halo has come down to us.57 The Anastasis Panel (Plate XXXIV¿) The subject of the small narrative scene on the right wall of this niche is the anastasis. The panel, which fits in below the curve of the vault, is cut short at the bottom. Thus, only the upper half of Christ's figure, in the centre facing right, survives, while Adam and Eve are even more truncated. Satan's figure is entirely eliminated, along with all the other usual elements of the lower part of the composition. The Old Testament kings, however, survive, rising from a strigillated sarcophagus, and appearing for the first time anywhere in this composition.58 An angel looks out from behind Christ's mandorla. It used to be agreed that the textual source for anastasis imagery in the West was the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus, which is known in older Greek and more recent Latin variants.59 Anna Kartsonis, however, has recently cast doubt on this direct connection, rejecting this text as the ultimate source on the grounds that early illustrations did not include all the text's iconographic elements, and vice versa.60 The earliest surviving Descensus chapter of the Gospel, which contained the actual anastasis text, is the Latin version, but even it cannot be dated earlier than the sixth century,61 and was based on older, eastern liturgical texts and homilies dating from 55See the S. Prassede apse inscription, note 21. 56See Osborne, 'Anastasis', 269 and 282.

By the time of the Zeno chapel, the Book of Revelation had achieved canonical status in the West, and the anastasis had become the preferred resurrection formula, though the early history of this choice has not fully come to light, and it is not even clear whether the anastasis in art was first introduced in the East or in the West.63 As far as the Zeno chapel is concerned, the ultimate source is not all that important, for by 817 the Gospel of Nicodemus can be assumed to be widely available in the West. All the earliest surviving monumental examples of the imagery are Roman, and date from the pontificate of John VII, 705-7, an era of strong Greek influence on the monumental art of Rome.64 It might be supposed that the Zeno chapel anastasis derived from the earlier Roman examples, if any of these three included an angel. Since none of them do, the origin must clearly be sought outside Rome, where we find that around the year 800 angels were characteristic of Lombard-inspired versions of the anastasis, as well as of the illustrations to the later, South-Italian Exultet Roll, such as Vat. Lat. 9820.65 This distribution persuaded Davis- Weyer that that the angel motif had spread from north to south via Rome and the Zeno chapel, with the ultimate source an illustrated Gospel of Nicodemus produced in Ravenna between 650 and 750, and now lost. However, it appears that the Zeno chapel anastasis cannot be directly on the line of evolution, for it replaces the pair of angels shown in all Davis- Weyer' s earlier examples with a solitary one. This implies that a different model was used or that a different text is illustrated. The angel is the only clue to the exact text chosen, since the lower part of the panel is missing. Davis- Weyer believes examples with paired angels illustrate the text from the Gospel of Nicodemus which tells that angels accompanied Christ on his descent Then the King of Glory took hold upon the head of the chief ruler Satan and delivered him unto the angels and said 'Bind down with irons his hands and his feet and his neck and his mouth.'66 We do not have to look far for a text with a single angel, the Archangel Michael, as a subsequent chapter of the Latin version tells how Christ holding the hand of Adam [as at the Zeno chapel] delivered him onto Michael the Archangel and all the saints followed Michael the Archangel and he brought them all unto the glory and beauty of Paradise.67 If this is indeed the moment illustrated beside Theodora's tomb, as I believe, its 62James, Apocryphal N.T., 95. 63See Cecilia Davis-Weyer, 'Die Altesten Darstellungen der Hadesfart Christi, des Evangelium Nikodemi und ein Mosaik der Zeno Kapelle,' Roma e l'età Carolingia, Rome, 1976, 183-95. ^These include the two paintings in S.

The anastasis theme - Christ's triumph over death, hell and Satan, and his retrieval of the souls of the Just who had died before his promise of salvation had been implemented, was important to Christians because it confirmed their hope that death would lead to eternal life. The resurrection, as symbolised by the anastasis, was central to any funerary programme, and so has survived in a tomb context in other Roman locations.68 It is not surprising, then, to find resurrection imagery adjacent to Theodora's tomb. It not only fits the overall programme of a funerary chapel, but it also places an image of promised salvation where Theodora would first see it on rising to her feet on Judgment day. The west (left) wall of this niche also once featured a figurai panel below the springing of the vault, situated lower down than the anastasis panel, on the same level as the figures in the lunette. Little remains of this mosaic but a heavily restored golden background with a few unreadable patches of colour. The last organised fragment depicts a tiny piece of a manufactured object such as a tomb or a sarcophagus at the bottom right-hand corner:69 probably this panel also illustrated a resurrection scene, most likely the raising of Lazarus. A precedent in Rome for placing these two scenes in apposition is the lost mosaic of the Oratory of John VII, 705-7, at Old St. Peter's.70 The importance of this niche in the overall scheme ot the chapel was emphasised by its unusually extensive decoration, which undoubtedly once enveloped the burial site right down to the level of the sarcophagus, marking it as the focal point of the chapel. The Right Niche (Plate XXXVa) The right niche also contains a mosaic in the lunette above the doorway, which, lacking a border pattern on the lower edge, has also been truncated by insertion of a doorway. There is no trace of mosaic on the side walls. The central subject of the panel is Christ. He stands between a tonsured and bearded elderly priest wearing a red chasuble and an elderly secular figure wearing court dress. The priest holds a golden book, his companion has a small gold cross and remnants of a martyr's crown. In the absence of inscriptions, identification of these figures depends on drawings and tradition. The evidence of another drawing from the Cassiano album shows that, as on the left, a complete rear wall survived in the right niche into the ^For example, the tomb at S.

The base of the niche was occupied by an altar with a central fenestrella covered by a grille, which presumably enclosed the fragment of the column of the flagellation, present in the chapel from 1223.71 Above this altar was a plain chest or sarcophagus which probably contained the relics of saints Zeno and Valentine, described by Panvinio in 1570 as 'above the column', and still visible there as late as 1699.72 The arrangement of the niche shown in the drawing cannot be earlier than 1223, when the column relic was brought from the Holy Land, and there is no evidence that the relics of Valentine formed part of the original endowment of the chapel: the earliest, and unverifiable, tradition places them there only in the thirteenth century.73 We are theretore torced to conclude that the lay hgure in the mosaic cannot represent Valentine. Possibly, it portrays Pudens, the virgin saints' forbear, in the court dress of a senator. The priest on Christ's right is probably Zeno, whose name is mentioned both in the marble plaque as 'Zeno the priest' and in the Liber Pontificalis, where it is recorded that Paschal's chapel was dedicated to Zeno, 'Martyr of Christ'. Even here, though, there is uncertainty, for the priest depicted lacks martyrs' attributes. Regretfully, we must conclude that it is not possible to identify either saint with certainty. The priest seems most likely to be Zeno; the lay person, Pudens. Whatever their exact identity, the purpose of portraying saints in this location was to evoke the memory of those holy individuals whose remains sanctified the chapel, and whose mystic presence had therefore represented the whole communion of saints at the burial of Theodora. The simpler decoration of the right niche as compared with the left, again emphasises that the chapel functioned primarily as a mausoleum, with its focus in the burial niche, and that the relics served the funerary function in a secondary role. V THE MOSAIC DECORATION OF THE FAgADE WALL (Plate XXXV6) The rectangular fagade mosaic is centred on the lunette window above the entry door on the outside. Two series of portrait medallions are arranged concentrically around this window. An inner arc includes eleven medallions of equal size. At the summit, the Virgin, dressed in a dark blue maphorion, holds the Christ Child in 71Baldoria, Capella, 263-4, 'scrive il Panvinio che i corpi di san Zenone e di san Valentino giacevano sopra di questa colonna, la quale fu ivi collocata nell'anno 1223.' 72O.

Their present location is unknown. 73A text which would date the transfer of relics of Valentine to the papacy of Nicholas IV, 1288- 92, could not be reconfirmed by John Osborne in the alleged source manuscript (cod. Vat. 3407, fol. 20).

To her right is a young cleric in a yellow tunic, to her left, the elderly priest in red from the right niche reappears. In additional medallions, four to a side, are the images of eight young women in jewelled collars and crowns. In the centre of the outer arc, there is a large medallion bust of Christ, surrounded by the bust-length, three-quarter view figures of twelve unnamed men, obviously the apostles. Triangles at the top corners contain medallion portraits of grey haired prophets. Oblong mosaic panels at the outer bottom corners are recent: the subjects, popes in double tiaras, probably reflect the early frescoes which once occupied these locations.74 Inclusion ot clipeate images ol apostles, prophets and saints on the lagade ol the Zeno chapel is another example of PaschaFs return to traditional formulae for his mosaic programmes. It was normal in Early Christian times to represent deceased but victorious saints, apostles and martyrs in medallions, a custom taken over from the funerary practices of the Romans and containing also an element of victory iconography.75 These images were presented in frontal or near-frontal view, like icons prepared for the devotion of the faithful. It may have been this icon-like quality of the Zeno chapel medallions that caused Klass to interpret the facade panel as the iconostasis screen of a Byzantine sanctuary, built by Paschal for the Greek monks at S. Prassede,76 an interpretation which ignores the chapel's documentation as mausoleum and martyrium. Rather, since it has been shown that the chapel's interior programme was created for the express purpose of aiding Theodora's salvation, it seems most fruitful to presume the outer panel expresses some part of this concept. In general, I believe that this outer panel reflects in miniature the Early Christian custom of decorating the upper facades of basilicas with mosaic. Paschal himself revived the old formula at S. Prassede, where the last traces of a mosaic decoration can still be seen in a window embrasure above the entrance door. His choice of grouped medallion images set around an archway also refers back to an Early Christian formula. As early as 424-34, at Ravenna, ten secular figures in medallions - Christian members of the imperial family - adorned the edge of the soffit of the triumphal arch at S. Giovanni Evangelista.77 The subject matter soon became standardised: Christ or his symbol at the summit of the arch was surrounded by the apostles, or, more rarely, by male or female saints, each in his own medallion. Examples from the sixth century survive in Ravenna at the Archbishops' chapel and at S. Vitale, as well as at Lythrankomi in Cyprus and at Porec. Nearer home, medallion images formerly adorned the triumphal arch at S. Sabina, Rome (422- 32), where fourteen - or possibly sixteen - apostles and saints in medallions flanked a central image of Christ.78 As at the Zeno chapel they adorned an archway, and each 74Baldoria, Capella, 266. * Al tempo del Giampini ( Vet.

Inscriptions seem to have been absent, and the figures, unusually, were shown in three-quarter view. In all these respects, the S. Sabina example was closest to the Zeno chapel, and may well have been the model for its outer arc of medallion images. It only remains to attempt to identify PaschaPs choice of individual prophets, apostles and virgin martyrs, as all are without inscriptions. Convention usually limited the apostolic collegium in art to twelve, in accordance with mystical ideas. The San Zeno facade apostles include a group - Peter, Paul, Andrew, James and John - who are recognisable, as they are identical with the named saints inside the chapel. None of the others can be identified with certainty. The figures in the top corners follow the venerable but generalised iconography of the major prophets.79 On the right is one identical with Elijah in the chapel's transfiguration panel. A clue to his companion's identity is found in the Gospel of Nicodemus Descensus chapter, where we read that Enoch and Elias (Elijah), 'two men, ancients of days' were taken up alive into Paradise to fight the Antichrist. There the Archangel Michael met them as he took the Just souls to Paradise.80 In actual fact, Enoch and Elijah were often seen as types of Christ's ascension, because each, according to the Old Testament, like Christ had been assumed bodily into Heaven.81 Since the ascension itself was seen as a necessary preliminary to Christ s second coming, this iconographic content would also fit within the chapel's programme. The virgin martyrs of the facade panel pose even greater problems of identification. Antecedents include the six at the Archbishops' chapel, Ravenna, and the full dozen at the Basilica Euphrasiana, Porec. All these are named, and so are the twenty-two virgin martyrs in procession at S. Apollinare Nuovo, Ravenna. This latter series has been analysed by Otto von Simson, who found that each saint was listed in the diptychs of the Roman or Ambrosian Canons of the Mass, or was specially invoked in Ravenna's ancient litanies.82 Thus, all were seen as being present at every eucharistic rite. Possibly, the same sort of thinking inspired Paschal to portray some of the women martyrs invoked in the canon of the Roman mass on the Zeno chapel facade. These frequently recited names - Felicitas, Perpetua, Agatha, Lucia, Agnes, Cecilia and Anastasia - must have been so familiar that their identity, like that of the apostles, was considered self-evident. Doubtless the medallion portrait-series also included Práxedis and Pudentiana. The Sources of the Iconographic Programme It has long been recognised that the purpose of sacred imagery in early medieval churches was neither primarily didactic nor simply decorative. The intention was rather to express the canons of religious belief in visible form through the creation of dogmatic statements in art. Thus, religious images served as reminders of the mysteries of the faith, but they also had meaning even in the absence of a viewer as 79Mouriki, Iconography, 48-51 and note 21. ajames, Apocryphal N.T., 140-1. 81For Enoch, Genesis V. 24.

These ideas explain the retrospective component in Paschal's iconography, which is rich in Early Christian quotations. It was obviously seen as logical to use models which, having been made in times close to the actual sacred events, were hallowed by sacred tradition. Early Christian elements of the Zeno chapel programme include the 'caryatid' angels holding up a disc, as well as the medallion images of Christ, his mother, the prophets, apostles and saints. The jewelled throne, the gesticulating saints, the Lamb on the hill of Zion, the roses and the waters of Paradise with their thirsting deer, the inhabited scroll, laurel wreath and jewelled borders, all have antecedents in the Early Christian art of Rome, and many of them also occur at Ravenna. Records show that Ravenna's mosaics were widely admired and even coverted in the Carolingian period, notably by Charlemagne,83 suggesting that the Zeno chapel's apparent references to Ravenna may be more than coincidental. Its resemblance to the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia is particularly striking. Not only do the two buildings share many features of iconography and ornament, but they share an architectural plan and a funerary function, as mausoleum for a high born woman. Of course, although these resemblances are striking, there may have been an even closer iconographic model among the numerous but lost chapels built around the early Roman funerary basilicas. Close iconographic links also exist between the Zeno chapel and S. Apol- linare Nuovo, whose virgin martyrs share most details of dress and stance. A good case can be made for an outline drawing of a Ravenna virgin being used as a pattern at the Zeno chapel.84 The use of pattern books and sheets is confirmed for the twelfth century;85 presumably they were also used in Paschal's time. Manuscripts may also have served as portable models. Therefore it is not unreasonable to seek for models in Ravenna, while remembering that there may have been very similar examples closer to hand in Rome itself, since the artistic formulae of Early Christian art were widespread. Paschal's mosaicists had another, somewhat idiosyncratic source of imagery at S. Prassede itself, in the form of the carved antique marbles which had been assembled for reuse there. Elements of these carvings were copied in the ornamental and vegetal areas of the mosaic, where the mosaicists were evidently free to improvise. For example, the strigillated sarcophagus from which the Old Testament kings arise in the anastasis panel is unique for this period.86 It could well be based on the strigillated sarcophagi which Paschal provided for the relics of the saints.87 The 83Pope Hadrian I's letter to Charlemagne authorising him to take mosaics for his buildings in Aachen from Theodoric's palace in Ravenna: Codex Carolinus, letter 67, Monumenta Germaniae Histórica, Epistolae Merowingici et Karolini Aevi, Vol. 1, 614. 84Mackie, Thesis, 40-1. 85D.J.A.

See also Otto Demus, Byzantine Art and the West (New York, 1970), 32-3, for a discussion of this and other pattern books and sheets. ^Kartsonis, Anastasis, 91, has commented on this sarcophagus, and sees it as part ot a continuing Western tradition. Since the examples she gives are all later than that in the Zeno chapel, it is likely that the iconographic detail originates right in the S. Zeno chapel, where a model was actually at hand. 87Two strigillated sarcophagi were found below the high altar of S. Prassede in the excavations of 1 729; they were joined by two others in the reconstructed crypt, which possibly came from the Zeno chapel.</page><page sequence="21">192 GILLIAN MACKIE prepared throne above the chapel's entry follows a standard Early Christian design, enriched here by Ionic capitals which terminate the jewel-studded legs below the seat. (Fig. 8) Ionic capitals had been chosen for the chapel's main doorway, as well as for the aedicule on the altar: they seem to have been a late antique reference, little used in intervening centuries.88 Classical egg-and-dart moldings are present on many of the carved marble architrave sections which are reused for the S. Prassede nave and transept; they reappear in mosaic disguised as the outer leafy element of the victory wreath surrounding Christ's image in the vault (Plate XXXI0). The inhabited scrolls of the altar vault and the window embrasure above also contain references to the chapel's sculptured marbles: the grapes of the window scroll (Plate XXXIi) copy the carved column bases (Plate XXXI¿); the distinctive acanthus plants of the altar vault echo the acanthus 'bindings' of the columns which now stand against the sanctuary walls, but formerly, it is surmised, formed a fastigium before the altar.89 A third, and major, influence on the S. Zeno programme was Byzantium. The Byzantine element is frequently mentioned in the literature, but has nevertheless not been precisely defined. Most recently, Brenk has searched the programme for components which, occurring singly or together, seem to be related to Byzantine programmes from before or after iconoclasm.90 Among these he lists the stylistic details of Christ's mandorla which he compares with those of the early ninth century Chludov psalter (Moscow, State Historical Museum, MS 129). There are obvious parallels between the anastasis mandorla (Plate XXXV6) with its white rays breaking through the outline, and the very similar examples that illustrate Psalms 679 (fol. 63v) and 8111 (fol. 82v) in the Chludov psalter. Nevertheless, the 'exploding mandorla', as Kartsonis calls it,91 was already known in Rome more than a century before, occurring in the anastasis at the Oratory of John VII at Old St. Peters. The 'mandorla' of the S. Zeno transfiguration, since it represents the outline of Mt Tabor, is not a valid comparison. Brenk also lists hieratically arranged medallion portraits as Byzantine, compar- ing the Zeno chapel with examples in the ninth century Byzantine Homilies of Gregory of Nazianzus (Milan, bibl. Ambrosiana, cod. E, 49-50). This comparison does prove the use of this motif in the East at this period, but it ignores its Early Christian origin, as well as the probability that the Zeno chapel medallion facade is derived locally from a monumental model, probably the one at S. Sabina. Brenk also derives the Christ on the Zeno chapel facade from the image on the Byzantine coinage, and the portal's Virgin Nikopeia from her image on the seals of the patriarchs Heraklios and Photios. These models were obviously available in the West: but their use underlines the eclectic nature of Paschal's inspiration, rather than confirming that a Byzantine programme was his direct source. The iconographic groupings which Brenk distinguished as Byzantine are the deesis with the etoimasia and the deesis with the transfiguration, two pairs each of which contains the deesis. Whereas images of the transfiguration or of the prepared ^Krautheimer, Rome, Profile of a City, Princeton, 1980, 134. 89Ibid., 134, Fig. 109. ^Brenk, 'Bildprogramm', 213-21. 91 Kartsonis, Anastasis, 91-2.</page><page sequence="22">THE ZENO CHAPEL 193 throne might refer to western models, any iconographic combination that includes the deesis obviously has a Byzantine origin, since this is a uniquely Eastern formula which symbolises the Last Judgment in Byzantine art. Its presence here is firm proof of an eastern component in the Zeno chapel programme. Since the deesis is the key to the entire decoration of the upper walls and vault, the whole upper zone must be read as eastern, a three dimensional 'greater deesis' which makes a coherent statement about the 'four last things' - death, judgment, heaven and hell.92 Thus the programme of this entire area, of which the deesis forms so integral a part, must be Byzantine in origin. Even though the chapel was built as a mausoleum rather than for the celebration of the liturgy, it shares many of the features of the classical post- iconoclastic Byzantine church, as defined by Otto Demus.93 It will be remembered that in this system the placement of images in a centrally planned church reflected the positions that the prototypes of such images occupied relative to each other in the universe. The holiest image, that of Christ, was largest, and was placed in the heavenly zone, the dome, where he was attended by his angelic court. Mary occupied the next highest place, usually the bowl of the apse. Narrative scenes of Christ's life, though absent in the earliest, classical scheme, later came to occupy the squinches of the dome. The lowest, earthly zone was taken by the saints: apostles, martyrs, church fathers, holy women, who were also hierarchically arranged, as if at a royal court. Great emphasis was also laid upon a symbolic correspondence between the architectural space of the 'cross in square' church and the universe itself. The figures of the icons stood against the golden mosaic backdrop as if they were in front of golden walls which represented the 'outer skin' of a magical space. Thus the interior of the church, the microcosm of the universe, was a space in which the holy saints were actually present, in accordance with the theory that the properly made icon had a 'magical identity'94 with its prototype. The worshipper who entered the church was seen as mingling with the saints, who, far from being mere images, peopled the interior space and interacted across it as if the whole church constituted a three-dimensional, living icon. These features of the Middle-Byzantine church also strike the observer at the Zeno chapel, and it is these similarities, far more than any resemblance between individual iconographic elements, that enable us to recognise the strong Byzantine component in its iconographic programme. Hierarchy, the positioning of the individual images, and above all, their interactions across the interior space of the building, are the important Byzantine elements in the mosaic programme of the chapel.95 92Oxford English Dictionary, under 'Eschatology'. 93Otto Demus, Byzantine Mosaic Decoration, London, 1948. 94Ibid, 7. 95Asmussen, Chapel of S. Zeno, 69, tries to establish the chapel's conformity to the Middle Byzantine schema by measuring the comparative size of the figures. On the basis of discrepancies of size she underemphasises the Byzantine element, and stresses the retrospective Western roots of the decoration. However, it seems more likely that hierarchy of size could be subordinated to the availability of space, when, as here, it was necessary.</page><page sequence="23">194 GILLIAN MACKIE These interactions are emphasised by the carefully rendered glances and gestures of the mosaic figures which ensure the correct interpretation of the iconographic content. The gestures of the deesis Virgin and Baptist towards Christ in the dome; the attitude of John the Evangelist, who faces the prepared throne of the second coming with his book, supposedly of his Revelation, in his arms;96 the larger procession of saints who join the petition of the primary intercessors in the deesis, are all examples of this three-dimensional interaction of the images within the chapel, which make the programme seem truly Byzantine in its feeling, as well as in its hierarchical layout. The carefully defined interactions between individual figures in the decoration are also the keys to understanding the overall meaning of the programme. No figure is alone, each by interacting with the others take part in a sacred drama: the re- enactment in perpetuity of the funeral rites which were once spoken here on Theodora's behalf. In the upper zone, Mary, the Baptist, the chosen apostles and the virgin martyrs repeat the prayer for Theodora's salvation as long as their images endure. The stage setting reveals that the drama takes place in Paradise, complete with celestial meadows thick with thornless roses; the undimmed gold of the firmament; the victorious Christ among his angels after his ascension. To this zone also belongs the jewelled throne which will be occupied on Judgment day. Below, Theodora stands among the sponsors who, sanctifying this place, will speak for her on the last day: Christ's resurrection and his coming in judgment are foretold above the altar, and the decorations around Theodora's tomb tell of the human soul's salvation through baptism and of its resurrection by means of Christ into eternal life. Many people have been puzzled by the premature appearance of such an obviously middle-Byzantine programme at the Zeno chapel twenty years before the end of iconoclasm, and in the West. The middle-Byzantine decorative scheme, however, did not arise de novo in the years following the end of iconoclasm in 843. It is rooted in the second council of Nicaea, 787, at which the validity of images was confirmed, and where several bishops individually agreed that images should again be venerated in churches.97 The subjects of such images were listed hierarchically: Christ, Theotokos, saints, apostles, martyrs, fathers and ascetics. Subsequently, the fourth session of the synod agreed officially that this series of images should be displayed, as it still is within the hierarchical decoration of every Byzantine church. Naturally the question arises of whether this sequence was expressed in art in the East before 816 and thus of whether a model did exist there antedating the Zeno chapel. Opinions differ on this question. Cyril Mango suggests that the brief period of icon worship under the Empress Irene, 780-802, which is poorly documented, probably produced little in the way of art, and that what there was, was non- figural.98 Robin Cormack, however, uses indirect evidence from the Carolingian West to postulate some continuity of figurai art during the first period of 96 As I have suggested, p. 13-14 above. 97Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, 7, col. 552-76.

Grabar suggests that the post-iconoclastic programmes were indeed prepared during the period after the Council of 787, and that although nothing in the East survived the second wave of iconoclasm, the lost works are reflected in Paschal's mosaics in Rome. In this connection he singles out the S. Prassede arch mosaics, and the decoration of the Zeno chapel, 'the earliest example to be preserved of a complete iconographic decoration applied to a cubical building with a central dome'.100 Paul Speck also decided in favour of the period between 787 and 816 being one of artistic activity, which he thought to be localised within monastic circles.101 It seems fairly clear that the new programmes drawn up in eastern monasteries at this time would become the models, after a considerable interval, for the official art of the capital after the final defeat of iconoclasm in 843. 102 However, suppression and eventual acceptance were not to be the only fate of the decorative schemes formulated in this period, for the harsh persecutions that iconophiles suffered in the East led many of them to seek refuge in the West, bringing their ideas and sacred arts with them. It has been demonstrated that Byzantine clerics sought refuge in Rome in the eighth and ninth centuries to escape persecution at home, and that the most persecuted of all were those who were especially associated with the production of images, the 'artist-monks'.103 Therefore, the documented Greek connection of the Zeno chapel, with its congregation of Greek monks, may provide a major clue as to why, while the iconographic models for the individual components of the Zeno chapel mosaics were taken from Early Christian art, the overall programme so obviously depends on a Byzantine model. This dichotomy raises interesting questions about the authorship of the programme and the identity of the mosaicists. Since the monks fleeing from Constantinople in the second period of persecution must have included numbers of the artist monks who were most vulnerable to attack, should it be assumed that these immigrants were responsible for the programme or the workmanship of the Zeno chapel mosaics. I think there is little doubt that the iconographic programme at the Zeno chapel had some input from the immigrant monks who arrived in Rome around the time of construction of S. Prassede in 817, and were installed in the new monastery by Paschal. Since it seems unlikely that Paschal would have sent for artistic advisers from Constantinople in a time of renewed iconoclasm, the Zeno chapel's pro- gramme, a completely up-to-date visual expression of the ideas of the Second "Robin Cormack, 'The Arts During the Age of Iconoclasm', Iconoclasm, Birmingham, 1975, 35-44, esp. 42-3. 100A.

It is possible that the choice of this eastern imagery reveals Paschal's desire to support the dogmas of 787 and the veneration of images, in opposition to the newly emerged iconoclasm.104 His position is made clear in the fragment of a letter written around 818 to the iconoclast emperor, Leo V, 81 3-20. 105 Here Paschal refutes the iconoclast position. He writes, in part, 'If God detests images, why do we consider it our highest prerogative to be made after the image of God?5 However, quite apart from any political statements that Paschal may have wished to make about figurai imagery in the context of iconoclasm, he also apparently wished to provide his mother with the most powerful and up-to-date religious imagery in her place of burial as an aid to her salvation. The actual work, we may surmise, was not put into the hands of monk-artisans from the East. Rather, it appears that local mosaicists were chosen, since not only did they draw on models which were at hand and which had the authority of ancient Roman usage, but they also carried out the work in the local, Roman style. This Roman style has been defined by P.J. Nordhagen, who in his study of seventh and early eighth century mosaics in Rome has distinguished two schools at work: the 'glass school5, which used glass tesserae exclusively, even for faces, and the 'marble school5 in which flesh is rendered in marble. He sees the 'glass school5 as representing the indigenous Roman tradition which stretches back to antiquity. The 'marble school5, by contrast, is seen as an import from the East, and the Roman works in this style, among them the fragments of Pope John VIFs oratory at Old St. Peter5s, as products of the patronage of the long series of eastern incumbents who dominated the papacy between a.d. 642 and 742, and probably imported materials and workmen from the East for their mosaics.106 Nordhagen has chosen the mosaics of the S. Venanzio chapel at the Lateran baptistery (c. 640) to typify the glass school. The work is carried out in brilliantly coloured glass. Garments, faces and features are rendered in large, uniformly sized cubes. The style is impressionistic, with isolated patches of red tesserae forming the facial highlights. The 'strongly plastic5 style of the heads contrasts with the linear treatment of the clothing. It is clear that the Zeno chapel mosaics, along with other works of the Carolingian revival in Rome, belong to this school. Their materials - all glass, of a uniform tessera size107 - and their impressionistic facial style characterised by strong orange highlights - contrasting with a linear garment style - are direct descendents of the S. Venanzio mosaics. The revival of this style in the Carolingian era has often been seen as consciously retrospective, in keeping with the revival of ancient forms that characterises the patronage of the popes of this period.108 This same tendency is 104 A position not too different from that of Hadrian I. See A. Freeman, 'Carolingian Orthodoxy and the Fate of the Libri Carolini', Viator, 16, 1985, 65-108, esp 70 f. l05Text in Giovanni Mercati, Mote di Letteratina Biblica e Cristiana Antica, Rome, 1901, 227-35. 106Per Jonas Nordhagen, The Mosaics of John VII (a.d. 705-7): The Mosaic Fragments and Their Technique', Acta ad Archaeologiam et Artium Historiam Pertinentia, II, 1965, 154-8. 107Asmussen, Chapel of S. Zeno, 80, claims the mosaics, while mainly of glass, incorporate marble in figures and costumes, and 'pebbles' in the flowers. As far as I can see, this is not the case. 108For example, by Nordhagen, ibid., 158.</page><page sequence="26">THE ZENO CHAPEL 197 also seen in architecture,109 and in iconography. However, although the decision to create mosaics is certainly strongly retrospective, since the medium - so brilliant, durable and expensive - typified the glories of Early Christian Rome, the actual stylistic features of the mosaics must have been dictated by the availability of materials. Krautheimer believes these works are made of recycled tesserae.110 JNordhagen, also, has recently pointed out that many ot the tesserae in the Koman mosaics of the early ninth century are worn by the roasting process which cleaned them of lime before reuse.111 This implies that Paschal's mosaicists were restricted wholly or in large part to the materials that were available from demolitions in Rome. It should not cause surprise then, to find them using traditional Roman materials - glass tesserae of a uniformly large size. The uneven availability of colour would also be explained: in the Zeno chapel, for example, pale green is at a premium, while rare, peg-shaped, opaque yellow tesserae are used in the virgin martyrs' robes to mimic gold. The precise source of the spoils remains open to speculation, for huge quantities were required for the vast mosaic programmes of the early ninth century. Perhaps they were taken from the ancient baths which by the year 800 had fallen into disuse. Recycling of tesserae in this period was not unknown, as is clear from Charlemagne's letter from Pope Hadrian I, 772-95, allowing him to take tesserae from Ravenna to Aachen for reuse in his Palatine chapel (dedicated 805). l12 Patrons in Rome may even have been inspired by this example, though in Paschal's case recycling of materials fitted in with his whole approach. His churches themselves were rebuilt from ruins, rather than being completely new foundations; the sculptural and architectural elements were carefully arranged ancient spoils, with modern work being used only to fill in gaps; it now appears that even his mosaics - crowning glory of his patronage - not only revived the iconographic formulae of bygone days but were created out of ancient materials, carefully cleaned and recycled. The harmony and beauty of the result must surely be considered even more remarkable. So it seems certain that the Zeno chapel mosaics are Roman made, in traditional, even reused materials, and fit into the general pattern of antiquarian revival practiced by popes of the Carolingian era. No information, however, is available about the artisans who were responsible for carrying out Paschal's decorative schemes. Discussion has usually assumed that mosaic was not made in Rome during the long period between the patronage of John VII, 705-7, and that of Leo III, 795-816, and that Carolingian mosaics were therefore products either of imported eastern artisans or of a new and initially not very skilful Roman workshop.113 This assessment must be adjusted to take account of a surviving 109R.

The recorded inscription attributes the mosaic to the reign of Paul I, 757-67, and reveals that mosaic art had not completely died out in eighth century Rome.114 It is even possible that there was continuity: if not, by Paschal's time there had been plenty of time for the craft to get re-established in Rome. It is clear that by 817 several workshops were already active.115 These had already been involved in the mosaic decoration of the Lateran triclinium (c. 798-9), the apse of S. Susanna (795- 9), the repairs at S. Maria Maggiore (e. 809), and the apse and arch at SS. Nereo ed Achilleo (e. 815-6). Paschal's mosaic programmes probably employed all the available local resources. Different hands - perhaps even various workshops - can be detected in the idiosyncratic ways of drawing facial features and using colour in the different monuments.116 This would not be unexpected in such a widespread campaign of mosaic as Paschal's, which covered the apses and arches at three large basilicas and a second transept arch at S. Prassede, in addition to the interiors of two vaulted chapels: Paschal's mother's funeral chapel at S. Prassede, and his own, now lost, in the left transept of Old St. Peters.117 What can be learned from the Zeno chapel mosaic programme and from the patronage of Paschal in general about the tastes and interests of this pope of seven short years? The son of a Roman, Bonosus, schooled at the Lateran Palace in the Old and New Testaments, the Psalter and church music, he had come to the Papacy from a position as superior of the monastery of S. Stephen the Protomartyr near the Vatican. His biography speaks of his piety and modesty and of his great love for the poor and his ready charity, though his qualifications for sainthood are not known, and his later years as pope were clouded by scandal.118 But quite apart from the flattering words of his biographer, the less flattering assessment of history, and our knowledge of Paschal's physical appearance which is marvellously preserved in mosaic three times over in his churches, a personality does emerge from the study of his patronage. A Roman, conscious of the greatness of the era of Constantine and of the revival of artistic patronage among his own predecessors, he sought to do honour to Mary; to the saints whose memory was especially venerated in Rome, scene of their martyrdom; and to Christ, the redeemer whose millenium drew near. Above all, perhaps, he sought to honour the memory of his mother, and help her achieve paradise. Paschal's works, though hurriedly erected, have endured, so that we know more about him as an individual than about any other pope of his era. We learn of an energetic patron, knowledgeable in the Faith, and in the expression of this ll4Waetzoldt, Kopien, 65, cat. 847 and pl. 463. 115Spain- Alexander, Carolingian Restorations, 18, deals with the restorations at S.

Study of the Zeno chapel, though, reveals another, more personal side of Paschal I. Although he had followed the traditional papal role in the official acts of patronage in his three basilicas, which are full of antiquarian references to the great early days of Christianity in Rome, when it came to the more private purpose of smoothing his mother's path to heaven by building and decorating a mausoleum for her, he chose the most modern and innovative programme that was available anywhere in the Christian world. His enthusiastic adoption of the new eastern iconographic programme makes it clear that he was by no means an exclusively antiquarian patron: rather, he was able to take the modern eastern formula and use it as the framework in which the ancient images of the Christian past could be displayed. His choice of the contemporary at the Zeno chapel forces a reassessment of his patronage, which clearly operated on two levels: official and private. And it is his private monument, the Zeno chapel, which offers a glimpse of the most modern art of the early ninth century: the new sacred art of the Byzantine capital in the period of renewed image between 787 and 816. This was obviously a period of great artistic activity, of which the Zeno chapel is a rare survivor.
