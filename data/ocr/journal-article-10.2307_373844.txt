<plain_text><page sequence="1">D. H. LAWRENCE'S THE TRESPASSER The Trespasser D. H. Lawrence's Neglected Novel LEO GURKO For a half century Lawrence's second novel, The Trespasser, has rested ob- scurely in its chronological place be- tween The White Peacock and Sons and Lovers. Most of the attention paid it has been brief and scornful. Graham Hough found parts of it "grossly and flamingly bad ... with the second-hand poetry of the woman's magazine."' Harry T. Moore called it the poorest of Lawrence's novels, "hectically over- written" in prose often "thick and gummy."2 F. R. Leavis remarked that "short as the book is, it is hard to read through. . . ."3 Even before the novel was published, Ford Madox Hueffer, who had "discovered" Lawrence, printed his early poems and stories in The Eng- lish Review, and arranged for the pub- lication of The White Peacock, called Professor of English at Hunter College, Leo Gurko specializes in 20th-century literature. His most recent book is Joseph Conrad: Giant in Exile. 1The Dark Sun (New York, 1957), p. 34. 2The Life and Works of D. H. Lawrence (New York, 1951), p. 86. 3D. H.

It has no construction or form-it is ex- ecrably bad art, being all variations on a theme. Also it is erotic-not that I per- sonally mind that, but an erotic work must be good, which this is not."4 Lawrence himself was of divided mind, and in his letters oscillated be- tween admiration and nausea for the novel. In October 1910, he thought it contained "some rattling good stuff." On December 17, 1911, he wrote to Edward Garnett: "It is a work too charg6, too emotional. It's a sponge too full of vinegar, or wine, or whatever- it wants squeezing out. I shrink from it rather." A month later: "At the bottom of my heart I don't like the work, though I'm sure it has points, and I don't think it retrograde from The White Peacock.... I hate it for its fluid, luscious quality." When the book ap- peared in 1912 and was reviewed, Law- rence rushed to its defense: "My beauti- ful Trespasser called a Reprehensible Jaunt. It is the joy of F.'s [Frieda's] soul.""5 One other reader found kind things to say. In an introduction to the Phoenix Edition of the novel (1955), Richard Aldington exclaimed over "the nympho- lepsis, this ecstasy of sky, sea and earth" that informed the story, and considered Helena to be "almost the most interest- ing of all Lawrence's women charac- ters." It took cold critical courage for Aldington to be this appreciative, for there are sentences in The Trespasser atrocious enough to kill literature out- right. He was nevertheless right, and the novel, for all its erratically ver- balized emotional sludge, is at once an essential prefigurement of the later work and a striking achievement in itself. The best and worst of Lawrence are on dis- play in it, with a dazed intensity of feel- ing and a savagely incandescent rhetoric not to be found in The White Peacock. The second novel, as much as the first, captures the author's peculiar genius. At its center is a professional violinist with the irritatingly flamboyant name of Siegmund. He is engaged in the characteristic Lawrence search for a human vessel, preferably female, into which he can freely pour his energies. Only in this way can he release into life his own separate self, mysteriously hidden in some fold or other of the buried consciousness. The discovery of this separate self is the prize at the end of the treasure hunt, and it is a sign of Lawrence's imaginative power that he can persuade us, with so little advance evidence, that the prize is worth all the Sturm und Drang to be endured en route. Though he earns his living at it, music seems to mean little to Siegmund, just as ten years later, in Aaron's Rod, the flute which Aaron plays so well is not essential to his being. Painting to Paul Morel, writing to Richard Somers -protagonists of other novels-are voca- tions in the workaday world, not keys to the major journey. Lawrence is not in the tradition of Flaubert, James, to some degree Conrad, and of his own contemporary, James Joyce, to all whom art was the instrument by which life was transfigured. Moral sensation, rather than aesthetic control, governed his voyage into self. Lawrence emerges, instead, from George Eliot and Hardy, whose novels he studied at an early age and whose influence he acknowledged. There are numerous references to Wagner in The Trespasser, but these are programmatic rather than musical. Helena, Siegmund's mistress during the five-day interlude on the Isle of Wight that occupies most of the novel, has studied the violin with him, and the two of them are full of topical chatter about music. The chatter has a hollow ring, 4Quoted by Lawrence in a letter to Edward Garnett, 18 December 1911, Letters of D. H. Lawrence, ed. by Aldous Huxley (New York, 1932), p. 17. 5Letter to Edward Garnett, 11 June 1912, Letters, p. 45.</page><page sequence="3">D. H. LAWRENCE'S THE TRESPASSER 31 and decorates the story verbally with- out advancing it emotionally. Lawrence uses Siegmund's violin for purely liter- ary purposes. After his death, it "lay in the dark . . . in its red silk shroud. After two dead months the first string had snapped, sharply striking the sensitive body of the instrument. The second string had broken near Christmas, but no one had heard the faint moan of its going."' The departure of Siegmund is thus poignantly memorialized in the un- stringing of his instrument. When alive, however, his relationship to the violin is not always so happily established. Two of the worst sentences in the book de- scribe his playing, with embarrassing anthropomorphism: "He had infused it with his life, till its fibres had been as the tissue of his own flesh. Grasping his violin, he seemed to have his fingers on the strings of his heart and of the heart of Helena" (p. 8). It is not art, but love, that Siegmund pursues. Not finding it with his wife, despite four children and years of co- habitation, he seeks it with Helena. Their lovemaking on the Isle of Wight is as rough an idyll as any in Lawrence. She turns out to be one of those women, Sue Bridehead is one, and Miriam in Sons and Lovers will presently be an- other, "with whom passion exhausts itself at the mouth." Kissing and talking about love, being verbally rapturous about it, are enough for her. But this kind of aesthetic-platonic lovemaking is not enough for him. He wants and needs the real thing, yet she cannot mask her aversion. "She sank away from his caresses, passively, subtly drew back from him .... His heart sank, his blood grew sullen at her withdrawal" (p. 23). In the end Helena does yield sexually, but it is anything but joyful and con- tains the same disturbing sacrificial ele- ment present when Sue gives herself to Jude and finally to Phillotson, and when Miriam does reluctantly give way to Paul's importunities. They thus rebuff one another. She injures him by her unwillingness and he cuts straight across her grain by his in- sistence. Recoiling, each seeks comfort and assuagement in the third party to their love affair, nature. Her hatred of the night's sexuality is cleansed by the ablutions of the day: "She tried to wash herself with the white and blue morn- ing, to clear away the soiling of the last night's passion" (p. 34). Siegmund, in turn, denied the fullness of love with Helena, seeks it in the arms of the sea. He makes love to the sand, the sun, the very stones on the beach and in the water. One of the novel's remarkable aspects is this transferred lovemaking. Siegmund assaults the elements, seeks to merge with them as surrogate vessels for the rejecting woman. He does not succeed. No man in energetic pursuit of his own particularity is likely to find nature, however entrancing, an adequate replacement. But faute de mieux, Sieg- mund makes a desperate lunge at it, and in the process generates much of The Trespasser's momentum. Lawrence finds analogues in nature to the passions of men. For brief flashes his characters turn into birds, anemones, wind currents, and undulations of water. Helena becomes a butterfly; she fuses with the bay. Siegmund and the sun- shine meld. These transmutations light up the landscape, compelled by the powerful current of energy rocketing through everything. The lovers all but pollenize, with "the seed-dust" of their love breeding "new blossoms" and ferti- lizing other souls. Flowers rise in aston- ishing tumescence: "A few poppies here and there among the wild rye floated scarlet in sunshine like blood-drops on green water." (p. 49). The throb of the physical universe is at times so great that it almost drowns the lovers in the pulsa- tions binding up sea, sun, birds, blos- "The Trespasser (London, 1955), p. 7.

The Isle of Wight, which penetrated so deeply into Law- rence's senses during the month he spent there in 1909, is the appropriate micro- cosm for one of the novel's great phrases: "Siegmund lay in the molten daze of love" (p. 13). This molten daze -already an imprimatur of Lawrence's art at this early stage-hangs over the story like an ecstatic cloud, at times smothering it in formless intoxication. The tragic difference between the lovers is manifest in their approach to nature. Siegmund wants to absorb it and "a sympathetic knowledge of its ex- perience" into his blood. To Helena nature is only a kaleidoscope of pretty objects whose mystery and magic she does not wish to penetrate but to keep at a distance (her approach to Siegmund as a lover is exactly the same). She wants to have an aesthetic experience, to visit nature like a tourist with highly de- veloped taste. Siegmund says to her, "'That is why you want to go again to a place, and I don't care so much, be- cause I have it with me' " (pp. 53-54). To her the world, and all the objects and people in it, are pieces of scenery, not moments of life. Siegmund recoils at being treated as scenery: ". . . she only wants to explore me like a rock- pool, and to bathe in me" (p. 100). This schism between them, painfully defined in their nights together, is measured with equal finality in the days they spend wandering about the island. Their disharmony is not a matter of misunder- standing or intellectual adjustment or arbitration of negotiable differences but a cleavage of temperament, for which there is no cure. The radical certainty of this lends the novel its central purpose. It is also responsible for the scene which brings the lovers' relationship to a jarring climax. Moved by sexual re- vulsion, her Wesleyan upbringing choking her with a sudden sense of sin, Helena turns momentarily ugly. The earth seems to her filled with gray ash and Siegmund an unfeeling brute com- pletely alien to her inner self. One day on the beach, unnerved by these sen- sations, she stares at him with sick despair. Bewildered, he seeks to comfort her, but she rejects him with such visibly contemptuous loathing that he is thrown back upon himself painfully. It is the final shattering. Since her rejection comes without warning, explanation or cause, he feels it to be in the nature of things and experiences it as one of those calamities that are all the more terrible for being endemic. "The sense of hu- miliation, which he had got from her the day before, and which had fixed itself, bled him secretly, like a wound. His haemorrhage of self-esteem tortured him to the end" (p. 101). She recovers from this mood and resumes her normal manner, but the damage has been done. The last line of Lawrence's story "The Blind Man" fits Siegmund's psychic situation: "He was like a mollusc whose shell is broken." Their island idyll over, the lovers re- turn to London. Images of dissociation surround them on the journey: the downs "dead asleep in the sun," the railway embankments covered "with exhausted hot flowers," the travelers themselves sitting "opposite each other with averted faces" (p. 109). At one point a swarm of German tourists en- ters the train and forces them apart with sweaty flesh and noisy jollity. During the Channel crossing their steamer al- most crashes into a pleasure launch, in- fecting Siegmund with thoughts of death. For him "the day is transparent and shrivelling"; he sees "the darkness through its petals" (p. 115). He sud- denly wishes that he and Helena would take different trains to London. But they are doomed to remain in the same compartment, locked in their coil of love and hate, of acceptance and rejec- tion, from which Siegmund has no real wish to free himself, convinced as he is that there is nothing for him else-</page><page sequence="5">D. H. LAWRENCE'S THE TRESPASSER 33 where. And so he returns home, to a resentful wife and to children whose stone-cold hostility freezes him, and the reader, to the bone. Chapter 22 of The Trespasser, which sets forth this melancholy homecoming, is one of the memorable sequences in Lawrence. It is written in his "objective" style, soon to be on more extended dis- play in the early parts of Sons and Lovers. The focus is the external event as it affects characters anchored in a commonly shared physical world. There is none of the fragmented impression- ism or magnetized undulations of feel- ing that mark Lawrence's "subjective" style, teemingly incandescent at its best, mucous at its worst. The chapter begins with a rapid description of London night movements: Lawrence is as alive to the rhythms of the city as he is to the splendors of the countryside. They remind Siegmund that the world is won- derful, far too wonderful for him, and underline his sense of removal from it as he enters his house. His wife and older son and daughter do not look up when he comes in, give no sign that they are aware of his pres- ence. "There was only that unnatural tenseness of people who cover their agi- tation" (p. 126). So they all sit in stony silence, nursing their sick, resentful un- happiness, like figures in hell. Leagued with their mother, the children refuse to meet his gaze, answer his questions only after an insolent delay, and drama- tize their repudiation by setting a place only for him at the supper table. They refuse to eat with him, subverting the ancient ritual to indicate that they re- gard their father not just as a stranger but as an enemy. He retreats to his bed- room in greater despair than ever. Only one more life tie remains to him. The next morning he meets his five- year-old daughter in the bathroom, hop- ing against hope that she is too young to have been drawn into the family quarrel. But she has been just enough disturbed by it to mar the encounter. Instead of throwing herself into his arms, she stands off suspiciously. If he went away, why didn't he take her with him? The rapport between them crum- ples, and with it crumples Siegmund's last barrier to destruction. These dam- aging family scenes, with their fragile proportions, are rendered with great delicacy. They reveal Lawrence's talent for dramatic realism, the traditional mode of nineteenth-century fiction that he had absorbed from the earlier English masters, the mode that was to save his intuitive side again and again from sink- ing into formlessness and self-indul- gence. The novel now rushes to Siegmund's suicide, but the details of it and the post- script chapters that follow are an anti- climax. With the central illuminations behind him, there is a lessening of Law- rence's interest. The drama of Sieg- mund's life reduces itself to the melo- drama of his self-inflicted death. In a kind of epilogue reminiscent of Vic- torian fiction, Lawrence feels compelled to tell us what happens to the surviving characters. Siegmund's widow runs a boarding house and slips contentedly into a lower-middle-class burble. Helena consoles herself in someone else's arms, though the sunburn she suffered on the Isle of Wight remains with her with in- trusive symbolism through the winter that follows. These developments have an external logic but they are unrelated to the emotional life of those involved and do not move us. Like the twanged snap- ping of a violin string, the novel reaches its last climax in the separation of Seig- mund and his small daughter. Since it draws its principal sustenance from him, as he dies the heat and glow pass from it. Like the opening chapter that begins after his death, the closing chapters are cold catalogues of figures cut off from the flow of energy that forced them into life. In them Lawrence is going through the formalities of novel-writing, a pro-</page><page sequence="6">34 COLLEGE ENGLISH cess in which he has little interest and no talent, and which he will soon aban- don altogether. It is this abandonment that will give his later narratives the sense of beginning and ending in the middle, and lay them open to the charge, often pedantic, of being carelessly con- structed. However, his departure from tradi- tional procedures has not yet sustainedly begun, and The Trespasser, in terms of plot, develops along conventional lines. But Lawrence's heart is not in tying up loose ends and releasing the expectations of the reader. He does not enjoy the task, as Trollope so plainly does. He does not pursue it with the dogged sense of duty that in Hardy's case often sub- stituted for a sense of belief. And at the end of Sons and Lovers he is to abandon it altogether. The deliberate ambiguity of that novel's final pages marks the end of Lawrence's concern for the rounded tale. Henceforth his characters are to be emanations of psychic energy rather than standard figures in one or more of the three dimensions, and the novels themselves will be vibrational rather than logical. The Trespasser is both. There is room in it for Lawrence's intoxication with feeling as well as his preoccupation with fact. But the duality of the world, that he strove throughout life to overcome, was more easily stated than solved, and in this early book the gap between sen- sation and event is throbbingly visible. Siegmund's experiences are to be under- stood as attempts to close the gap, to find in others equivalents of himself. But his wife crawls into the cocoon of domestic security and does not respond to his sentient being, while his mistress, an aesthete and bluestocking, filters ex- perience through a delicately artificial screen of feeling that he cannot pene- trate, that he can only violate. His search for correspondence in the flesh and person of others is thus defeated, and the current of life energy thrust here back upon himself turns into a cur- rent of death. Siegmund is unlucky in the women chance sends his way. His dependence on the right personal relationships un- derlines Lawrence's somber view of the human dilemma. Men can get at them- selves only through the responses of those they are intimate with; if they do not find the right intimates, they are doomed. Yet this element of subser- vience to fortune carries with it its own counterweight for it forces men, often against the movement of their own na- tures, into involvement with others. Left to their own devices, the characters in Lawrence would lapse into their solipsis- tic selves, a luxury they cannot afford in the pursuit of their peculiar happiness. Under the compelling need for self- realization they are driven, willy-nilly, into the larger world where they must undergo the difficult and chancy col- lisions, jostlings, and psychic negotia- tions that lead to equilibrium. Siegmund and Helena go through their five-day adventure. In terms of their ultimate purposes, it is a failure, and for Sieg- mund, no longer in his first youth, a par- ticularly disastrous one. But by drawing out their natures to a pitch of maximum intensity, the love affair supplies them with a meaningful life awareness that is almost the equivalent of emotional success. Thus the principle of luck is balanced by the principle of experience. In their interpenetration lies the bridge between matter and mind in Lawrence, the link between the dualities of his universe as well as between his solid and his palpitational modes of writing. The uneven execution of The Tres- passer extracts a heavy price from the reader, but the novel yields its treasures. Its very detachment from Lawrence's early life had a liberating effect upon him. Unlike The White Peacock it did not take place in the familiar Derby- shire landscape of his childhood. In con- trast with Sons and Lovers its charac-</page><page sequence="7">35 ters were not drawn from his father, mother, and the close companions of his youth. Its minor figures were based on persons he knew at the school in Croy- don where he was teaching at the time, while the principal characters were sug- gested to him by a friend, Helen Corke, who was herself writing a novel on the same subject.' Though he was of course committed to the story as a writer, he was not as a man, and while their separa- tion may have reduced the emotional clarity of The Trespasser, it raised its value as a free imaginative exercise. It is at once less controlled in its effects than Lawrence's first novel and more polar- ized in its triumphs and failures. At times his natural frenzy gets out of hand; it succeeds in penetrating the soul tissue of the lovers with a corrosive energy that all but consumes them. One of the excesses of the novel is that Sieg- mund and Helena are subjected to more pressure than they can bear, for Law- rence lunges at them with too much fire power. Yet the illuminations thus achieved are almost worth the damage done. Upon reexamination, The Trespasser emerges as a work of quite remarkable interest. It is more than a swatch of early Lawrence. It unmistakably reveals where The Rainbow and Women in Love come from, and though it is cer- tainly a compendium of all his faults, it is also a coherent assemblage of nearly all his virtues. Nor are they neatly balanced against one another. They are instead strewn every which way over the whole landscape of the book. But at various points they give off that fierce blaze which was Lawrence's spe- cial signature. 'Moore, pp. 82-83.</page></plain_text>
