<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES THE HEBREW CONCEPTION OF PERSONALITY IN RELATION TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD1 Recent studies * in Hebrew psychology have made us familiar with two important aspects of Hebrew thought, first, that the physical body was fundamental, and second, that there was no knowledge of a central organ unifying and controlling the rest First, then, we are not to think of mental processes as such in isolation from sense reac tions and bodily feeling. Emergent emotions reveal themselves in the snorting of the nose {'aph, nose, also means anger), in flushing or paling of the face (Jer. xxx. 6), the clapping of the hands and stamping of the feet (Ezek. vi. n), the lightening of the eyes or of the face (Num. vi. 25 ; Ps. xxxi. 16), the queer feeling at the pit of the stomach (Jer. iv. 19), or the rapid beating of the heart (2 Kings vi. 11). Simi larly, external objects apd dam of experience are known and recognized by the physical reactions which they arouse.1 Physical, psychical, and spiritual were undifferentiated ; the fundamental thing in man is his body.4 Secondly, the independent functioning of organs and limbs which goes hand in hand with the non-recognition of a central unifying organ may be said to imply diffusion of consciousness. Each several organ or limb should be pictured as self-operative and capable of psychical as well as physical function. The ascription to tfie eye of such qualities as pride,, humility, or purity (Ps. cxxxi. 1 ; Jobl^xii. 29 R.V. mg.; Hab. i. 13) or such feelings as desire, pleasure, and satis faction (Ezek. xxiv. 16 ; Mic. iv. 11 ; Prov. xxvii. 20) means that to some extent the eye is regarded as having 'a moral and psychical life of its ' A paper read to the Oxford Society of Historical Theology on 22 November 1945· 2 Notably those of P.

They are more than " united " : the body is the soul in its outward form', Israel, I-II, p. 171. The impossibility of divorcing mental from physical processes is, of course, recognized for all levels of thought, although our own habits of speech and thought tend to obscure the dependence between them, Whitehead, Modes of Thought, 1938, Lec. VIII, pp. 208 ff. XL VII</page><page sequence="2">2 . THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES own These things must not be taken to be mere metaphors as they have become for us.1 In view of these two modes of thought and of the strong sense of corporate personality from which the Hebrews only slowly emerged, we may well ask whether they had any sense of self-identity and of individuality, and if so, wherein it lay ? It is consonant with this diffusion of function that Hebrew did not readily come to use any one word to express the strong personal or reflexive pronoun (such as the Accadian râmânu)* but drew on a number of words. The word most frequently so used is nephesh, 'soul'.3 Other words, denoting parts of the body, are similarly but much less frequently used.4 Of these, heart and face may be singled out for special mention, the one for its close approximation to nephesh in meaning, and the other for its use in speaking of God. ' Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread' said the father-in-law in Jud. xix. 5, and in Prov. v. 12 the sage's pupil is warned to avoid association with the 'strange woman' lest he be forced to say, on reflection, 'How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof'.5 One of the clearest instances of the use of ' face ' in this sense is in 2 Sam. xvii. 11 where the R.V. text reads : ' And that thou go to battle in thine own person' and the margin, 'that thy presence (Heb. face) go to the battle'. Another is to be found in Exod. xxxiii. 14 'and he (Yahweh) said, My presence (face) shall go with thee'.6 The Hebrew, in his realism, thought and spoke of himself in terms of that organ which was the centre of interest or of operation at the moment ; the other organs, if they come into reckoning at all, remain auxiliary. Pedersen thus speaks of this habit of thought: 'When, e.g., a man looks at some thing, then the eye at that moment is the particularly active part of the soul, but this activity includes the whole of the soul, just as it 1 See H. W. Robinson's essay in Mansfield College Essays, p. 275. 1 Ungnad, Babylonisch-assyrische Grammatik, par. 11. 3 e.g., Ps. vi. 4. Nephesh occurs about 730 times in the Old Testament: 200 of these are to be taken as instances of the usage here indicated, in 113 instances the word may be translated 'person', and in a further2ii 'life' i.e., the principle of physical life. See Mansfield College Essays, p. 271 ; Kônig, Syntax der Hebraischen Sprache, 1897, p. 11. Accadiari used the cognate napishtu less frequently than râmânu in this sense. 4 e.g., bones, eye, face, flesh, hands, head, heart, liver, loins, mouth, spirit, (voice). 5 Kônig, op. cit., Dhorme, Revue Biblique, 1921, p. 391. Briggs, Psalms, vol. i, p. 199, commenting on Ps. xxii. 27, says, ' The heart here stands for the man himself, in late usage, confounding leb with nephesh'. 21 instances of this usage may be counted. 6 Also Deut. iv. 37, the LXX of Isa. lxiii. 9, and the refrain of Pss. xlii f.

Therefore the soul is at that moment eye op. cit., p. 176. The self is, as it were, local ized in the operative organ. This 'fluidity of reference" from the part to the whole and the whole to the part is also further indicated by examination of the usage whereby one or other of the two words used of the inner life or being of man—heart (leb) and ' soul ' (nephesh)—is coupled or contrasted with an external organ or limb in such a way as to express .the whole man, e.g., heart and hands (Gen. xx. 5), 'soul' and eyes (x Sam. ii. 33).* The more or less regular use of one or other of these two words to express the centre of thought, will, and emotional energy indicates a feeling after the unity of the individual, but the diffusion of psycho physical functioning amongst the external organs is not thereby super seded.3 In view of this usage it is only a rough generalization to say that ' an exhaustive description of human personality was given by saying 'body and soul' (as in Isa. χ. i8)'.4 Soul and body are linked together four times only, whereas with other organs nephesh is linked some 25 times and leb some 100 times. Admittedly, the Hebrews only gradually reached a conception of the independence and unity of the individual, even as they emerged bit by bit from the more primitive ways of thought.5 Although they had no suitable word for it, there are not wanting signs that they did come to recognize the fact of individual personality. The existence, already mentioned, of a number of instances of circumlocution for the strong personal pronoun points to some such recognition, as does the more or less regular use of heart or soul for the inner side of human life. In this connexion a difference of usage between nephesh and leb may be noted. Leb as the centre of thought, and will is used in conjunction with other parts of the body so much more frequently than nephesh that one cannot resist the inference that the latter is the more comprehensive term and more properly conveys the sense of self-hood and individuality.6 Nephesh comes as near 1 Phrase used by H. W. Robinson in a slightly different connexion, ' Cf. also Eccles. xi. 10; Ps. lv. 21; Prov. xxi. 23, &amp;c. 3 The frequency with which heart is coupled with other parts of the body is as follows: flesh (basar) 5, liver 3, palms 5, bowels 2, lips 8, mouth 8, mouth and lips 2, eyes 17, eyes and ' soul' i, eyes and ears 3, bones 5, arm 1, flesh and bones I, 'soul' 26, soul and flesh 1, face 4, kidneys 5, tongue 3, step 1, fingers 1, neck i, flesh (sh'ar) 1, head 1, knees, loins, and face 1, heart and hands, spirit and knees 1. Nephesh is used in a similar way but much less frequently, perhaps because of its wider connotation. 4 H. W. Robinson, The People and The Book, p. 362. 5 The persistence of the sense of corporate personality until quite late— indeed it was never fully lost—is illustrative of the slow emergence from the primitive level. 6 In 200 instances it means 'self' and in another 113 it means 'person'. Its</page><page sequence="4">4 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES to expressing the essence of human personality as anything in Hebrew can.' This sense of self-identity and individuality is further strengthened by the giving of a personal name. 'Why does everyone as a matter of course', asks R. R. Marett, 'find himself possessed of a personal name ? ' 'Now self-identification he goes on to say, ' by such homely means is bound to enhance the sense of a man's self-identity." Like other ancient peoples, the Hebrews attached a great deal of importance to the name and in some respects seem to have regarded it as identifi able with the person to whom it was given.' The name was also the key to the personality, as is evidenced by Abigail's caustic comment pn Nabal : 'for as his name is, so is he, Nabal is his name and folly {nabal) is with him' (i Sam. xxv. 25). The personality of a man might be summed up in his name and might even survive in it. It was desirable, in the absence of any hope of individual resurrection, for a man to earn a ' good name ' that it might live on in his descendants after his death. A man's personality is somehow wrapped up with his name. This raises the question of so-called 'extensions of the personality'. Anthropologists tell us that primitive man did not arrive at any clearly defined conception of the individual, that its 'limits are variable and ill-defined' and that 'the "appurtenances" (clothes, belongings and other things that have had contact with the person) are an "extension of the individuality'".4 It is true that certain incidents and turns of speech in the Old Testament can well be explained in the light of such primitive thinking, notably the attempted use of Elisha's staff .to restore life (2 Kings iv. 29 ff., though it is to be noted that it proved ineffective !), and the implied objectivity of the word and the name, but such interpretation ought not to be made the only key to Hebrew mentality. An atomic view of personality, such as this might well lead to, does not readily fit instances of the extension of personal influence by physical contact. Such extension of influence or power beyond the individual may be seen in the laying of Moses' hands on Joshua to transfer the 'majesty' of office (Num. xrvii. 20-3), or in the placing of the hand on the head of the person receiving a blessing (Gen. xlviii. 14) or beneath the loins of the person to whom an oath is made (Gen. xxiv. 2, 9, xlvii. 29). In very rare instances was the power so strong as to be capable of indirect transmission, as it were, through use in the plural in this sense goes against the conclusion drawn by Dr. A. R. Johnson, The One and the Many in the Israelite Conception of Godrp. 12. In Ps. lxxxiv. 2 it occurs in parallelism with heart and flesh. 1 Pedersen, pressing this fact to an extreme, can say : 'Such as he is, man, in his total essence, is a soul', op. cit., p. 99.

II These three elements in the Hebrew conception of personality were primary factors in the development of awareness and knowledge of God. It is true that God Himself may far transcend man's capacity to know Him (' man shall not see me and live '), and j^hat man's experience of Him may rise far above what he has the pd^rer to articulate, but nevertheless in both knowledge and articulation man presses on to a measure of attainment. In the attempt at articulation, however, man is bound to use the categories of thought available to him and every now and again strains to break free from them. i. The significance of physical sense. We may not dismiss too readily as metaphors such descriptions of man's awareness of God as depend on the use of the senses of sight, hearing, and touch (even, perhaps we may add, of taste, Ps. xxxiv. 8; cf. Pss. xix. 10, cxix. 103; Ezek. iii. 3). Undoubtedly those that have passed into current use have become metaphors and symbols,1 and may even have done so within the limits of the Hebrew Bible. The basis of human personality in Hebrew thought was flesh (and neither spirit nor soul) and, what ever else it may mean, the perplexing phrase in Job xix. 26 cannot naturally be translated 'without my flesh shall I see God' (R.V. mg.). Vision of God, realistically imagined, has come to be a feature of the future life, but in the Old Testament it was a potential feature of this life, however fraught with danger to mortals and however rare a privilege it was conceived to be. On the whole it was a privilege accorded in. its fullness only to Moses.3 The visions of the prophets " See also Federsen, op. cit., pp. 165,170, 198, and Bertholet, Dos Dynamis tische im Alien Testament, 1926. 1 Cf. Edwyn Bevan, Symbolism and Belief. 3 Exod. xxxiii. 11; Num. xii. 8; Deut. xxxiv. iio. The tradition in Exod. xxxiv of the reflected glory shining in the face of Moses enhances the intimacy. It was looked upon as so rare a privilege, however, that one account denies him a full frontal view of God's glory and allows him to see ' only His back . . . i.e., so to say, only the afterglow* (Driver, Exod., p. 363). On one occasion the 70 elders 'beheld God, and did eat and drink' (Exod. xxiv. 11). The conversion into metaphor of such visual experience is perhaps to be seen most directly in the phrase 'come to see God's face' which came to mean simply a visit to the sanctuary. The Masoretes, obsessed by the sense of divine transcendence, altered the phrase to make it mean 'come to appear</page><page sequence="6">6 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES differed by being, as it were, a degree less intimate and immediate (or 'personal') than Moses'. Nowhere is any attempt made to give an objective account of the figure of God ; the canonical prophets offer no details, and even in Ezekiel the only positive note struck is that of persistent brightness. We may be entitled to claim that such visual experience of God resembled that of seeing bright concentrated light as of lightning or fire. This idea certainly underlies the con ception of the glory of God.1 With less frequency but with equal force did the sense of touch enter into spiritual experience. Isaiah felt the touch of the live coal on his lips, vi. 7, and Jeremiah the touch of God's hand on his mouth, i. 9. The hand of God became an element in prophetic inspiration, Jer. i. 9, xv. 17 ; Ezek. i. 3, ii. 9, iii. 14, 22, viii. 1, xxxiii. 22, xxxvii. 1,2; Isa. viii. ii.2 Hearing was a much more constant feature and naturally lent itself to subsequent metaphorical adaptation. Sound is incorporeal and suggests movement and power. It was, so to speak, less immediate than sight and less dangerous to mortals. ' Ye saw no form, only ye heard a voice', Deut. iv. 12.3 There was manifold variety. God was heard in the garden in the evening, or coming with His host to battle and heard in the sound of the mulberry trees (2 Sam. v. 24), or speaking to Elijah in the loneliness of retreat (1 Kings xix), or in Eliphaz's own room ' when deep sleep falleth on men ' and ' stillness and a voice' was heard (Job iv. 12-16). Interpretation is made the more difficult by reason of the well-known fact that Hebrew had but one word for thunder, sound, and voice. Before the knowledge of secondary causes began to encroach on the spiritual field the thunder was the voice of God (Ps. xxix), but even within the Old Testament some distinction began to be made ; hence we read in Ezekiel of the voice of Yahweh ' like the sound of many waters', xliii. 2. before God' and committed a solecism thereby. The unaltered phrase has remained only in Gen. xxxiii. to and Job xxxiii. 26. The altered phrase is found in Exod. xxiii. 15, xxxiii. 23, xxxiv. 20, 23, 24; Deut. xvi. 16, xxxi. 11; ι Sam. i. 22; Isa. i. 12; Ps. xlii. 3. It is important to note that though the Old Testament speaks frequently of the face of God (139 times, apart from prepositional uses of panim), very rarely (probably 3 times only) may it be translated presence. See the writer's article 'The Face of God in the Old Testament' in Expos. Times, Sept. 1939. 1 See the article 'The Presence of God' by the writer in Expos. Times, Oct. 1945. 1 The Hebrews seem to have had a vivid and responsive sense of touch: cf. Exod. x. 21 : ' darkness which may be felt', and one recalls the story of Elisha's revival of the widow's son by contact of limb with limb (2 Kings iv. 34). In this connexion may be mentioned the legend that Moses died by the kiss of God, which developed out of the Targumic rendering of Deut. xxxiv. 5. 3 On this see J. Hempel, op. cit., p. 9, n. 3.</page><page sequence="7">ARTICLES 7 The sense reactions involved in awareness of God may well be illustrated by Eliphaz's vivid account of his experience, Job iv. 12-16. Such reactions as these, when they are taken up into the experience of the prophet, become an important element in prophetic conscious ness. A recent writer, Abraham Heschel,1 finds in the human sympathy with the emotions (the pathos) of God, known primarily through sense media, the key to the proper understanding of prophetic revelation. 2. Out of this complex of experience there emerged very gradually a measure of concreteness in the conception of God. He was known through channels of sense and in ways typical of human relationships and such bodily organs were ascribed to Him as were appropriate— face and eyes for sight, hands, right hand and arm for touch, and voice, mouth, and lips for speech and hearing.2 This corresponds to the diffusion of function among the parts of the body which is so marked a feature of human psychology. At no place, however, apart from personifications like that of the blood-stained warrior (Isa. lxiii. 1-6), does one find more than the barest hint of definite and therefore limited corporeality. The clearest such reference is Genesis i. 26, 27, ' Let us make man in our image (çelem), after our likeness (d'mûth) '. It is not true to Hebrew realism to interpret this, as has been done, as referring to the capacity to govern the created world.3 The clue to its meaning is rather to be found in Gen. v. 3 : ' Adam . . . begat a son in his own likeness, after his image, and called his name Seth.'4 ' For many generations ', wrote Montefiore, ' the common belief clearly was that Yahweh had a body and a shape : and this shape was probably conceived as very similar to—only larger and grander than—man's. Traces of this belief, ending up with mere metaphor, are scattered throughout the Hebrew Bible.'5 The familiar verse from Auguries of Innocence comes readily to mind : God appears and God is Light, To those poor souls who dwell in Night ; But does a human form display, To those who dwell in realms of day. 1 Die Prophétie, 1936, p. 98.

Ps. xxxix. 7 is a quite different usage. Only in very late Jewish literature does the likeness to God come to have psychical and spiritual content only, Wisdom ii. 23. (Moore : Judaism I, p. 448.) 3 The Old Testament and After, p. 17.</page><page sequence="8">8 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES God's form, however, was not for man to behold, except in the rarest of circumstances (Deut. iv. 12; Num. xii. 8).* It was also strictly forbidden to make an image or likeness for the purpose of worship (Exod. xx. 4). Along with this anthropomorphism went the vivid anthropopathism of the Old Testament and both were enriched by the occasional. personifications of God.* There was a reticence in representing the full 'form ' of God (His person, as we might say) which does not seem to have been felt in regard to the mention of the several limbs and organs representing Him in action. This reticence may have been an instinctive safeguard against sterilization in the idea of God and is to be linked with the strongly aniconic nature of Yahwism. Yet the fact remains that the reality of the presence of God, coupled with an awareness of Him that was physical in origin and form, was undiminished and matched that universal craving in man for a God who not only hears man's cry to Him but is ready at hand to help. This contrast of reticence on the one hand and of concrete reality on the other may be but one aspect of the problem that is expressed in another way by Solomon's question : ' But will God in very deed dwell on the earth ? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee ; how much less this house that I have builded ! ' 1 Kings viii. 27. The paradox involved seems to have led the Hebrews (probably unwittingly) to experiment in finding the right speech media for the description of God's person (or personality) as it was apprehended on earth by men. 3. This leads to the third fact of Hebrew personality, the developing sense of individuality and self-hood. Against a background of multi plicity of gods—a common feature of Semitic religion-^Israel developed a belief in the uniqueness of Yahweh and ultimately in His universal sovereignty. Yahweh does not seem ever to have been pictured as a corporate person embracing all other gods as, for example, was the war-god Ninurta in a text from Assur in which '... all the important deities are listed successively as parts of the body of Ninurta : e.g. his face is Heaven; Enlil and Ninlil-are his two eyes; the protecting goddesses of his two eyes are Gula and Belili (Belit-ilani) ; his chin is Ishtar of the stars ; his lips are Anu and Antum ; his tongue is Pabilsag ; his gums are the vault of heaven and earth ; his ears are Ea and Damkina ; his skull is Adad ; his forehead is Shala ; his neck is Marduk ; his throat is Sarpanitum ; his breast is Nabu—and so on down to the lower ex * Cf. alio Job iy. *6; Ρ», χνϋ.,ιό. 2 For anthropopathiams see Jer. ix. 33; Isa. lx. 10; Zeph. iii. 17; Isa. xvii. 13; Deut. xii. 31; Jer. xiv. 19; Ps. cvi. 40; Lev.'xx. 33; Exod. xx. 5; and for personification, Gen. iii. 8, xi. 5; Exod. iv. 34; Judges v. 4, 5; Isa. lxiii. 1-6; Mic. i. 3 f. ; cf.

Even the multiplicity of ' forms ' in which God manifested Himself on earth seems to resolve itself into a sequence rather than into a composite group.1 They, arose out of the need and desire to express the self-hood and presence of God, but it was inevitable that the basic element in God's personality should be sought elsewhere than in a body of flesh.3 One way was not far to seek, viz. the use of nephesh and kindred words with the force of strong personal pronouns. That is how the term ' face of Yahweh' comes to be used of the 'presence of Yahweh ', but it should be noted that there are only three instances of this—one of the three being by reconstruction from the LXX— namely, Exod. xxxiii. 14; Deut. iv. 37; and Isa. lxiii. 9 (LXX). In effect it means Yahweh Himself, in person.4 Another way lay in the use of the name of Yahweh. The very name yahweh is expressive of individuality and personality. Just as a man's name may sum up and express his whole personality, almost objectively, so God's name came to be the expression of His whole personality or being—His earthly presence. The phrase 'to call upon the name' undoubtedly long retained some of the magical element with which it came into use, and it was clearly felt that the solemn usé of the divine name assured God's presence (Exod. xxxiv). In pursuit of this idea we may perhaps say that wherever the idea of the name occurs in a theophanic con nexion it carries with it the sense of God's immediate presence, as in Exod. xxiii. 20 f., where Yahweh's name is said to be in the Angel. In Deuteronomy we read of 'the place which the .Lord thy God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there'. This conception of the relationship between God and His sanctuary is limited almost entirely to passages where the Deuteronomic editor's hand can be traced or where there is possibility of Deuteronomic dependence.5 Beyond this the 'name' conception occurs only in Isa. xxx. 27. May it not be said that it came into use, remained for a while and served its turn, and then fell into disuse ? It was the way in which the Hebrews for a time expressed the personal presence of Yahweh. It was God's earthward self. Was it identical with God or was it an ' extension of 1 Albright, From the Stone Age to Christianity, p. 165. 1 The concept of corporate personality best explains the relationship between Yahweh and His prophets or His worshippers (H. W. Robinson, ' The Council of Yahweh', J.T.S. 1944, and A. Causse, Du Groupe Ethnique à la Communauté Religieuse) rather than God in Himself (against A. R. Johnson, op. cit.). 3 The contrast between men and God is strongly felt in Isa. xxxi. 3 ; Gen. vi. 3; a Chron. xxxii. 8; Jer.xvii. 5; Pes. lvi. 5, lxxviii. 39,ciii. 14-17; Job x. 4, 9; seePedersen, Israel, pp. 176 ff., and Eichrodt, Théologie des Alien Testa ments, i. 106,107. * Fr.

The Angel, as is well known, is but a pale reflection of the anthropomorphic presence of God and, apart from later literary uses, is very largely confined to the two Pentateuehal narratives J and E. It was Ezekiel, as far as we can tell, who coined the use of the word Glory to express the apprehensible presence of God on earth. It has for its basic element that awe-striking brilliance as of fire or lightning which was so marked a feature of theophanic experience. Ezekiel was followed by the Priestly writers and here and there elsewhere in post-exilic books: The Wisdom books, approaching the problem from a different angle, find in the Wisdom conception one that brings together both the universal and the particular, both the cosmic-creative and the national redemptive elements in God's earthward dealings. In these ways and severally did the Hebrews crystallize their consciousness of God's presence and personality. Woven into this ever-changing surface and yet going much deeper in validity and in usefulness is the idea of the Spirit of God. Unlike the ideas so far mentioned, it persists, more or less, throughout the whole Old Testament, often conveying little more than the sense of power—an outward thrust, as it were, of the person ality of God—but now and again expressive of the full personality of God. The personality of man was conceived in terms of a body animated by God's inbreathed, life-giving spirit, whilst the personality of God came to be expressed in terms of that animating power itself. We have travelled far from the realm of anthropomorphism in its simple sense of the corporeal presence of God, but there is a common bond that holds both that and the spirit conception in the forefront of our religious thinking. Both are dynamic. Of Israel's anthropomorphism Professor G. Ernest Wright says :3 ' Her God was no abstract idea or principle. He was a living, active, powerful God. Hence, anthropomorphism in Old Testament religion was the very reason for its dynamic and virile character.' And of the Spirit of God Dr. H. W. Robinson wrote : ' Where God is present, He is always 1 The term used by Dr. A. R. Johnson in The One and the Many in the Israelite Conception of God, following Levy-Bruhl. 2 F.
