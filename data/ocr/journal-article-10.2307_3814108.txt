<plain_text><page sequence="1">JAMES H. VAUGHAN Folklore and Values in Marghi Culture Relations between folklore and culture should be of primary interest to cultural anthropologists, for not only is folklore a part of culture, and as such a topic of investigation, but it serves as a "commentator" on its own society.l It constitutes a body of material which objectifies many of the subtleties of life. Values which can only be inferred from observed behavior are frequently made explicit in folklore. Of course folklore is not exclusively an explicit statement of values, for it is couched in social and cultural circumstances that may be far from familiar to the investigator. Finally, what it does not say may be as important as what it says. It is widely understood that an adequate understanding of the relation between a culture and its folklore is dependent upon an appreciation of the cultural context of the lore.2 An additional emphasis must be added when our interest is more anthropological than aesthetic. The wider meaning of folklore can only be abstracted from a representative sample of the lore that is actually told in a society. In the extreme case it may be that anthropologists would be better advised to collect tales from audiences than from tellers, because the tales that are being told are of more importance to him than the repertoire of what can be told. Many collections of folklore fail to indicate an awareness of this statistical consideration. This presentation attempts to illustrate some of these points through a description and interpretation of folklore in a single society. It pro- l This is a revision of a paper presented at a joint meeting of the seminars on Con- temporary Africa and Folklore Theory and Techniques at Indiana University in April, 1964. I am indebted to the members of the seminar for their constructive criticisms. 2 Cf. William R.

VAUGHAN ceeds from a general description of the culture,3 to a discussion of the nature and role of folklore in the society, and finally to a consideration of the values implicit in the lore. CULTURE The Marghi, who number about 75,000, live in northeastern Nigeria in the southern portion of the Chad Basin and extend into the Mandara Mountains which form a part of the border between Nigeria and Camer- oun. Their culture is not notably homogeneous, undoubtedly as a consequence of three factors. First, they have no historical homogeneity, being comprised of numerous clans of several distinct traditions who immigrated to the area from different directions. Second, they have for some time been organized into autonomous and frequently hostile kingdoms. Finally, there is differential acculturation among Marghi with Muslim tribes of the north and west. The materials presented in this paper were collected from the central and eastern areas which are, however, more homogeneous and unacculturated. Traditionally Marghi reside in compact hamlets or villages which are usually found atop mountains or at the bases of inselbergen in the Chad Basin. This pattern results in a surprisingly dense population, particularly in the mountains. The densities of some of the mountain kingdoms undoubtedly exceed 200 persons per square mile. Vegetation is of a savannah type, though some of the mountains are more densely forested. Rain, which measures about 35 inches annually, falls only during five summer months. The oral histories of the Marghi indicate gradual and sometimes circuitous migrations from the east, but the recent history is more specifically concerned with the continuing hostilities with the Fulani during the past century-and-a-half. Throughout this period, the eastern 3 More detailed descriptions of Marghi political organization and religion can be found in James H. Vaughan, "Culture, History, and Grass-roots Politics in a Northern Cameroons Kingdom," American Anthropologist, LXVI (1964), 1078-95; and by the same author in "Religion and World View of the Marghi," Ethnology, III (1964), 389-397.

Murdock, "African Cultural Summaries," unpublished manuscript in the Human Relations Area File, New Haven, Connecticut (1958).</page><page sequence="3">FOLKLORE AND VALUES IN MARGHt CULTUE 7 Marghi were generally driven back into the mountains or contained there, while in the Chad Basin, the inselbergen served as refuges onto which they could retreat when they were attacked. This enforced mountainous life was compatible with their eastern mountain origins, and it seems probable that Marghi in great numbers have resided in the open plains only in very recent times. The Fulani were never of suicient numbers to occupy the area effectively, and Marghi did venture off the mountains or out of the valleys from time to time, but they had to be on the alert for slave raids. In one case a Marghi kingdom organized a retaliatory force, but they were defeated in a campaign that is recalled in legend and song and whose battlegrounds are still visible. Some of the worst conditions for the Marghi were in the first quarter of this century and are still remembered vividly. Their adamant confidence in their own institutions has seemingly highlighted their hostility towards the Fulani and casts its shadow into the future. Afarghi are agriculturalists and the land is generally fertile. With checks placed upon the Fulani by the British, the valleys and plains have been farmed increasingly, and we find that land tenure offers no problems to contemporary Marghi. Where there is terrace farming in the mountains there may be a scarcity of arable land, but this does not seem to be general. With the aid of the short-handled hoe and the sickle, a consistent, though small, surplus is produced and distributed through weekly markets. The only significant economic specialization is practiced by an endogamous caste called aakyagu who do all smithing (though not smelting), leatherwork, grave digging and corpse care, and scarification. Female aakyagu also make all pottery. Cycles of activity characterize the economic system which often merges imperceptibly with what might be called leisure. The annual dichotomy of wet and dry season dictates the cyclical nature of work. The agricul- tural season is short and work correspondingly intense. Other activities are usually carried out in concert with neighbors and kinsmen, and the social context of work, apart from routine farming, is very noticeable. Building houses, making mats, fences, and roofs, decorating calabashes, preparing food are all usually done in groups of friends. A solitary worker is rare. Politically, Marghi are organized into small autonomous kingdoms, the largest of which is approximately 7,000 persons. Kingdoms are apparently rare among the tribes of the Mandaras, and it may be that</page><page sequence="4">8 JAMES H. VAUGHAN the Marghi are unique in that respect, for Lembezat has characterized ';les montagnards du Mandara" as having "apparente anarchie sur le plan qu'on dirait politique."4 Nevertheless, Marghi have sovereign communities presided over by single hereditary heads possessing judicial and executive powers. These heads are assisted by representatives in charge of sub-systems within the sovereign whole. This seems sufficient to call the unit a kingdom and the executive a king. Furthermore, the king conforms with what we know of the typical "divine king" in Africa. He is in part a priest with specific religious duties, and his office is surrounded by mystical sanctions and taboos. The king is the embodiment of his people, and many minor customs which surround him may reflect idealized customs of Marghi; as, for example, when he is granted max- imum privacy-no one may see him eat, defecate7 or with his head uncovered. On the other hand, some of the customs surrounding him seem to recognize the symbolic tie between the king and kingdom and tend to promote the happiness and vigor of the kingdom through the king. For example, a king should never mourn nor attend a funeral, nor should he tire himself with work in the fields. The life of the king should be serene and thus the serenity of the kingdom be assured. On one occasion when there was a prolonged lliatus in the spring rainsf it was widely said that this was the result of an untoward act which had befallen an important king. The comprehensiveness of the kingship even includes the aakyagu caste, for in some kingdoms the king may marry into it, and the king's burial is according to the customs of a chief blacksmith's burial. There are also legendary ties between the ruling clan and the aCkyagu. The king's officiation at major public rituals is necessary for the growth of the crops. In such activities there is an implicit notion that his per- formance is directly related to the well-being of the kingdom. He is, therefore, surrounded with a supernatural aura. These uIlique and mystical qualities are the basis of the king's power. However, the power of the king is not entirely located in the office, for it is sustained through a complex centralized organization. Without going into detail, we might emphasize that one division of the structure advises and thus legitimizes the king, while the other administers the kingdom. Since these powers never overlap, none of the advisers are 4 Bertrand Lembezat, Les populations palennes du Nord-Cameroun et de l'Adan10l{cT (Paris, 1961),p. 37.</page><page sequence="5">9 FOLKLORE AND VALUES IN MARGHI CULTURE also administrators nor vice versa. This then prohibits anyone but the king from having autonomous power and results in a peculiarly indirect system of goverment with only circuitous checks on the possible excesses of a king. In some kingdoms of the Marghi this consolidation of power is incomplete, and there are more checks than this picture would indicate. However, in other kingdoms the structure is hierarchical rather than pyramidal as those characterizing the kingdoms of West Africa, particular- ly the Guinea Coast.5 Even in the most hierachical Marghi kingdoms there is one effective check, which is characteristic of systems of divine kingship. The power of a divine king is difficult to curb since divine power tends to become absolute power, and consequently the solution used by many societies is the institutional regicide. Marghi regicide (thlida) is not automatic, as among the Jukun, for example; rather it comes only when the king has failed in his role or when his rival can muster enough forces to attempt a coup. The Marghi family is patrilineal, patrilocal, and patripotestal. The elementary unit is composed of a man, his wivesS unmarried children, and occasionally dependent siblings or the family of a newly married son. Each such family unit resides in a compound of separate mother-child households. Since patrilocality is the rule, a hamlet or a village is com- posed of related compound heads, though this aggregate is not a recog- nized kinship grouping. There is considerable residential mobility based on sibling rivalry. After the death of a father and the distribution of the inheritance, the younger sons occasionally move away, sometimes into new hamlets or villages but often to the village of their maternal relatives. This explains the sporadic occurrence of avunculocal residence which Murdock naively assumes to indicate prior matriliniality.6 The clan is the only formal extended kin grouping. Clans have ten- dencies to be localized, at least each has its presumed home, but the mobil- ity of the population causes the membership to be disbursed. Each clan has two names one masculine and one feminine-its own cus- toms, and a distinctive history. There is virtually no authority structure to a clan and few binding injunctions except that members should help one another in times of crisis. Probably this has not always been the case, a I am here following the distinctions made by Aidan W. Southall in his Alur Society, a Stady in Processes and Types of Dozninafion (Cambridge, 1953), p. 250 ff. 6 MUrd°Ck P- 437-</page><page sequence="6">10 JAMES H. VAUGHAN as there are indications that the political system has emasculated the clans. The rules of exogamy are not phrased explicitly in terms of clan; rather they extend bilaterally, prohibiting marriage between persons more closely related than third cousins. However, the degree of relationship is much more distant in most marriages. In small clans, intra-clan marriage is not possible, though in large ones it is. In one case, a clan has divided into two exogamous sections, but the typical development, it seems, is to continue marrying out of the clan until the clan is so large that intra-clan marriage is not challenged. Clans are constantly in the process of segmentation and reformation as people migrate from one place to another. There is another kin grouping called jil composed of putatively distant bilateral kinsmen. It is an amorphous unit without permanence and plays little role in the life of the people. In general, Marghi kinship is of a generational type, though the uni- versal familial functions of authority and affection are sharply diSerenti- ated between the lines of the father and the mother respectively. There is little ambiguity of role in their kinship system: one knows just what to expect from each individual. A male may expect from father and father's siblings instructionn discipline, and a general proprietary concern; but from mother and her siblings, particularly the maternal uncle, one can expect comfort, a certain amount of indulgence, and even open af- fection. Even after divorce, which is quite common, the differentiation of role persists. The dichotomy is revealed in the contrasting attitudes toward the villages of one's father and mother. The former, which is usually the village of oness youth, is thought of as a place of discipline and authority, while the latter is a refuge inhabited by indulgent af- fectionate "mothers. ' Society is divided into three classes, plus the aUkyagu or blacksmith caste previously mentioned. At the top are the members of the royal clan, who actually enjoy few advantages if they are not closely related to a king; next are the commoners who comprise the bulk of the society; and finally slaves constitute the third class. Though the position of slave is hereditary, it is not depraved and they may marry freely with non-slaves, and some slaves have considerable prestige as a consequence of their wealth and political position. It is difficult to place the aUkyagu in any kind of social hierarchy. Notions of superiority and inferiority, while not altogether irrelevant, are not primary considerations. Rather, black-</page><page sequence="7">ll FOLKLORE AND VALUES IN MARGHI CULTURE smiths are looked upon as being essentially different and, because of this, even a bit frightening. They are thought to practice unusual and repulsive customs and occasionally to have unnatural powers. In con- versation a person who is a blacksmith is an aUkyagu, not a Marghi, though in broader contexts it is recognized that aakyagu are Marghi. The theology of the Marghi is based upon a belief in three categories of supernaturals. Iju the supreme entity is the cause of everything, good or evil. Though Iju is personalized in a few myths, sayings, and beliefs, on the whole it is a remote and impersonal concept, perhaps better translated "fate" than "god." The other two categories of supernaturals are malevolent or mischievous, the immediate causes of most misfortune. They may be good only by not doing bad. Yal are the more dangerous of these two, being capable of causing death and serious illness. They are anthropomorphic in habit though not in appearance and are believed to reside in or at unusual natural phenomena, such as large rocks, trees, springs, or similar locations. Shatar, the third class of supernaturals, are similar to yal except that they cause less serious illnesses and are occasionally only mischievous. They are more numerous than yal and their abodes less specific, though ant hills are one popular habitation. One special form are dwarfs who live in the earth and mischievously cause people to become lost. Though shatar are not as sinister as yal, they cannot be treated lightly. It should be emphasized that the supreme power, Iju, is superior to the other two in that it causes them and can countermand them. Ancestors, both paternal and maternal, occupy minor positions in Marghi theology. The most recently deceased ancestor is revered, and sacrifices at the ancestral shrine are conducted only once a year. The influence that an ancestor has over the living is poorly conceived but by concensus it seems to be largely malevolent. The eldest living male descendant is responsible for the patrilineal shrine, while a deceased woman's youngest son is responsible for her shrine. The concern with female ancestors is almost negligible and not universal among Marghi clans. Because Iju is omnipotent and omnipresent, there is a distinctly fataIistic theme in the world view of the Marghi. However, since this power is remote, it is only implicitly concerned with daily routines and the problems of men. Such matters are in the immediate province of the lesser deities yal, shatar, and occasionally ancestors. These forces</page><page sequence="8">12 JAMES H. VAUGHAN are not, however, intraetable and llence the actions of men, through ceremoniesv influerlce them. Man, tllerefore, is not helpless in the faee of a specific supernatural power, such as a yal or shcltar, except to the extent that all things are governed by Iju, the remoteness of which is almost beyond his concern. This world view is not unusual in Africa and has the advantage of allowing Man to control or attempt to control -his fortunes while also allowing him a final explanation of failure that does not destroy his beliefs in the effieacy of religious rites. He may, in brief, be predestinarian without being passive. This helps explain an apparent contradiction between theology and belief, on one hand, and ritual and behavior on the other; for in fact the fatalistic belief system is superficially masked by the system of rites. The vast majority of rituals center about the lesser deities and are coneerned with propitiating them for the alleviation of specific ills or with building a store of good will against the uncertainties of the future. Witchcraft occurs occasionally in Marghi society. Witches are usually women who figuratively eat their victims' souls. They are revealed either through an ordeal or by a witch-finder usually a male who is a self-eonfessed witch. Revealed witehes must agree to give up their victims or else they are severely punished, enslaved, or killed. Talk about witches is not uncommon, and though there were instances of witchcraft during my fieldwork, I do not believe that it has occurred frequently in the reeent past. By some standards the aesthetic development of the Marghi is minimal, for they have virtually no "objet d'art." They have no tradition of art carving, such as masks, headdresses, or statuary. Though calabashes and other utilitarian objects are commonly deeorated, there are no persons who specialize in deeorations, and any decoration is secondary to utility. Roek pain,tings are done by southern Marghi, but these are an essential part of an initiation and betrothal rite through which every male must go and are not done by specialists.7 It is not only the poverty of art obieets which eauses me so sumrnarily to dismiss graphic and plastic arts as a part of Marghi culture. I am as much swayed by my interpretation of the Marghi aesthetic which states, briefly, that art is in the act of ereating rather than ill the thing ereated. They are, in general, more coneerned with performance than product. 7 James H. Vaughan, "Rock Paintings and Rock Gongs Among th Marghi of Nigeria," Man, LXII (1962), 49-52.</page><page sequence="9">13 FOLKLORE AND VALUES IN MARGHI CULTURE ProductsS both material and immaterial, are unchallenged, empirical parts of reality (excepting taste which is always subjective). Qualities of productss including their "goodness" or "badness," are also empirical and not open to question. Marghi rarely express subjective opinions about "thingss' but readily do about actions. As a consequence of this aesthetic concept, their greatest interests seem to be in the performing arts-music, dance, and folklore. Music plays an important role in Marghi life, for social dancing is the institutional method of social intercourse for the unmarried. Dances take place after the larger weekly markets and at night during the full moon. Drumming accompanies all dancing, and though they have several other instruments, the drum predominates. FOLKLORE Marghi distinguish between two types offolklore (kumtu); kumturmbamdu, which are riddles and proverbs; and kumturna, which are tales and by far the most widely-told form of folklore. Riddles are not recounted in question and answer form, but made as statements which must then be interpreted. For example, "One of my goats has two skins" may be inter- preted as a reference to a calabash gourd which when picked and divided becomes two containers. Similarly, ;'I have two gowns; the one which I wear does not become old, but the one which I put away becomes old quickly" can refer to the fact that a road which is used is much better than one which is unused. These kumturmbamdu are told primarily for amuse- ment and doubtlessly to test the wits of the young; literally they are "tales to catch people." In some cases it may be conceded that the answers are more a matter of rote learning than deduction, for many kumturm- bamdu are obscure. For example, s;My motherss muzha (a kind of food) dissolves in the sea" is to be interpreted as a reference to the moon for it shines everywhere. Proverbs are also kamturmbamdu presumably because they too need to be interpreted and may indeed ;'catch people." Many are readily understood by Euroamericans. La shiwur awandi lifu translates "'Eyes stink' says the blind man" or Iju yu misipar scll is "God is the magical charm of man." But others are more obscure; Ndzibur imi di wudu is literally "Diving into water with body" but refers to getting into a</page><page sequence="10">14 JAMES H. VAUGHAN situation without understanding what it is all about, or Dankwadu lifu, "Grass rope (of a particular type) blind man" refers to a pointless act as the rope made by a blind man would unravel even as he made it. Kumturna are the basic folktale of the Marghi. They are tates in which the rules of evidence are suspended. Not only are the acts of magic a regular part of these tales, but the sequences of events and general logic are not as they are in the world of men. Events take place in a kind of fantasy world. The fantastic and the bizarre are commonplace, and because they occur in kumturna they are unchallenged. Both human and animal characters are popular and occur frequently in the same tale. Songs are often included in the tales, and this un- doubtedly accounts for the term kumturna, s1 meaning "to sing.' idealiy, the storyteller will sing the song, but actually he or she may sErnply refer to it as "a song about ...." The central characters are almost invariably male, even when the characters are animals. The hero is usually an individual of considerable wit, and often he has magical power. He ls usually of humble origin and accedes to wealth and high status. Frequently the hero is the youngest son who is opposed by his brothers. One popular motif has the hero as the youngest of seven sons; the eldest son is frequently an ally of the youngest in the motif. Another male character is the king, though he seems never to be the central character of the story. He has magical powers, notably a whip which causes death but which can also restore life. He is not, however, depicted as being the center of a political system like that discussed above. The king is frequently duped and occasionally succeeded by the hero. The hero often has a companion who, although depicted as his friend, is frequently an adversary; this motif is particularly apparent in animal tales where the friends are often squirrel, who is known for his wit, and hyena, who is known for his greed. Although the central characters of stories are male, the most pre- dictable characters are female. Interestingly, heroes are usually described specifically as the sons of women, the father not loeing mentioned. The hero's mother is a rninor character who quickly dlsappears, though there is occasionally a reunion at the end of the story when the hero returns to his destitute mother. The wives of the hero are important characters. There is the favorite wife described as the most beautiful woman in the kingdom, who often is the cause of all the troulole, and the "chorus" of co-wives, who are envious of the favorite. In rare instances</page><page sequence="11">15 FOLKLORE AND VALUES IN MARGHI CULTURE the beautiful girl is the central character of the story, in which case she is opposed by her co-wives. An evil magical woman, variously described as a woman of death and a cannibal woman (though never in my sample as a witch) is often the hero's greatest adversary. Finally, there is the old woman, the malabjagu, who is wise and often clairvoyant and who has a notorious appetite for eggs. It is she who usually reveals duplicity and aids the hero in the solution of his problem. There is, in general, very little character development in African folklore, and Marghi lore is no exception. Characters are stereotypes whose nature is ascribed. Youngest sons, kings, old women are characters who will behave in predictable ways. Character ascription is most noticeable in the instance of animal tales, wherein each breed is imprinted with a type of behavior. Such ascription, of course, gives a frame of reference for the audience which allows them to anticipate behavior. Yal and shatar, the malevolent deities, are only occasionally depicted in kamtu, though it is often assumed that evil characters with their magical powers are the representations of yal and shatar. Iju, the supreme deity, does not figure predominantly in tales. Kumtu are told only at night, and traditionally they are told by old women (cf. the "old women" character above), though in practice anyone may tell them. There is a saying that to tell kumturna during the daylight will cause one's grandparents to die. However, no one believes this statement to be literally true, though the pattern of night telling is well established. Each tale begins with "Taskumtida," a word which seems to be a compression of words and which I have never been able to translate meaningfully. A formal closing is less general. Often the teller pulls his nose or sometimes says, "Ki na dam kumtu giya," which means "pay back my story." Although tales may be told in intimate groups of two or three, they are popularly told in large sessions, often in sequence by several people. Everyone likes to listen to kumtu; though they are ideally told for children, often the young are brushed aside or hushed so that elders may hear. The rapport between a good teller and his audience is not unlike that between certain preachers and their congregations in our society. There is mutual stimulation, with comments by the audience highlighting the points of the story. However, there is no attempt by the audience to direct or modify the story. The best teller I knew was a middle-aged man with a deep and sonorous voice who could tell a story with humor, realism, or excitement. In one re-</page><page sequence="12">1G JAMES H. VAUGHAN cording, the comments of the audience are clear and their laughter and interjections make the performance memorable. One Marghi youth in the United States found it so exhilarating that he wanted a copy of the tape. It seems significant that he wanted a copy of the "telling,' not the taleu a point which strengthened my interpretation of the WIarghi- aesthetic (supra pp. 12-13). Oral histories which are widely known are not included in kumtu, and cannot be considered a part of folklore so long as that term refers to oral art or literature. fiIistory to them is rather like history to us a col- lection of ficts to be judged in terms of its accuracy instead of its artistic qualities. For this reason I do not refer to Marghi clan and political histories as legends. Clan histories are told in a routine manner with little embellishment, and generaliy comply with rules of evidence; by which I mean that the credulity of the audience is not tested. In some cases feats of magic are reported, but they are told for the better portrayal of an individual and not as an essential part of history. There is virtually no consideration given to artistry in recounting history. As an anthropo- logist, I became well-versed in the histories of some clans and kingdoms. I got as many versions as I could, collated them with other historiesS synthesized themv and worried about details. This activity was not un- noticed and in a very short time r was recognized as an expert in clan and political history; on several occasions my king deferred to my superior historical knowledge. But in no sense was this akin to being an expert story teller, for that involved aesthetic abilities beyond my command. Since history is, then, set apart from other forms of oral tradition I will not discuss it in this paper. FOLKLORE AND CULTURE We come now to a discussion of life and values as expressed in Marghi lore. Although a concern with family life is often more implicit than ex- plicit, one generally sees emphasis placed upon large families and the tragedy of childlessness. Both the importance and the frangibility of friendship are stressed in tales, and Marghi have an institutional form of friendship in which confidences are shared. The stresses of marriage, which have already been noted, are very characteristic of family life. Co-wives are usually antagonistic towards one another and a wise man</page><page sequence="13">17 FOLKLORE AND VALUES IN MARGHI CULTURE has little to do with his wife socially; there is too much of an opportunity for jealousy. In every case in which a character in tolkore has a favorite wife, trouble ensues. This is also widely believed to be characteristic of real life. For though men talk of favorite wives, no one admits publicly to having one. It may be as one man told me, "The wife in your room is your favorite." The Marghi may be characterized as reserved and defensive concerning the uncertainties of life, yet aggressive against open threats to order. They live in a potentially hostile and unpredictable world in which man must survive by his wits. He must not commit himself openly, for then to fail would cause intolerable embarrassment; he must persevere through duplicity, guile, and cleverness. It is not surprising then that the most consistent theme in their lore is that of cleverness and wit. The hero, for all his strength and magic, is above all clever. But so, too, is his adversary, and thus Marghi learn both to be clever and to expect clever- ness in return. Very often the hero is deceived by trickery once7 but when it is tried a second time he has learned his lesson. Once in my experience when I had been deceived by a rogue, I was discussing it with a group of men who urged me to retaliate. Not wishing to engage in the usual protracted Marghi dispute, I recited to them our proverb, "If you cheat me once, shame on you; but if you cheat me twice, shame on me." I could not have picked a better comment; they immediately understood and thought me wise. Trickery is akin to thievery in many instances, especially if the victim of the theft is an alien, and, as we shall see, there is a sense in which all outsiders are aliens to Marghi. Certainly thievery is a noticeable theme of Marghi lore. Occasionally the hero is a professional thief who climaxes his achievement by outwitting another thief? and often heroes resort to thievery to achieve their ends. In Marghi society thievery is a fact of life. Though it is intolerable to steal from one's own people, stealing from outsiders is permissible and often expected. During the dry season many boys and young men migrate to urban centers with the avowed pur- pose of thieving. Theft not only is supported by the value placed upon cleverness and guile, it also is consistent with the uncertainties of life. Marghi are themselves subject to thefts, and locks, security measures, and suspicion of outsiders are constant. Cleverness is not only used as an offensive maneuver in Marghi lore, it may be defensive as well. Frequently, persons who have been out-</page><page sequence="14">18 JAMES H. VAUGHAN witted resort to guile in order to disguise their loss. This, too, is charac- teristic of their world view, for they attemlpt to control their world to the extent that they will not admit defeat, but try to hide it. The most elaborate circumlocutions and precautions are taken to effect an air of confidence. Pregnant women are called "dead women," and newly-born infants are not socially born and recognized until seven days after bio- logical birth. In the former case they condition themselves to tlae higll maternal mortality, and in the second they can "deny" the deaths of their most prized possession during the most critical period of life. Marghi defensiveness is also characterized by a very low tolerance for ambiguity. They cannot abide indecision and will often force decisions, following a logic that seems to say that failure is preferable to uncertainty. This can be illustrated along with several other points made above in the following tale which is related in substance just as thle teller set it forth. Squirrel and hyena go out to beg The wise makes jests and the fool repeats then1. Taskumtida. One day a squirrel and a hyena went to a town to beg. They agreed in advance to take new names so that the last name spoken should receive the item offered. When they were outside the town squirrel asked his friend what name he wanted. But hyena said, "First, tell me yours." Squirrel replied, ';My name is Give-it-to-them." But when hyena said that was the name he wanted, squirrel took the name Either-of-them. Now they agreed to these names. Whom do you think will get the most things? Let us continue and see. They entered the town and went into a compound which had two women and four children. They said that they had come from a far place to beg anything from the people of that town. They then sang a song for the people. One of the women said to her son) "Here is a cloth. Give it to them." When hyena heard this, he said to squirrel, "That will be mine because she spoke my name." But squirrel cautioned hyena to listen to the final word. The boy who was bringing the cloth asked his mother to whom should he give it, and she replied, "Either of them." So it was given to squirrel. They did this many times and squirrel got many things, even a cow. After they had been in that town for some days they decided to return. Along the way, hyena said they must kill the cow and divide the meat. Squirrel agreed and the cow was killed. After they had skinned it, and as the sun was about to set, squirrel said to hyena, "Go get some of that fire so we may cook some of the meat." And hyena left in the direction of the fire. What do you think was the fire? It was the setting sun. Of course the sun went down and darkness came. By that time hyena was</page><page sequence="15">19 FOLKLORE AND VALUES IN MARGHI CULTURE far away and could not find his way back. Squirrel had all the meat. Hyena was deceived. We may see in this tale that by agreeing on the procedure of the names that the probabilities of conflict are reduced. They commit themselves to a course of action which reduces their personal involvement. We may also see here the theme of cleverness, the stereotyped character of the animals, and to some extent the attempts of the teller to involve his audience in the tale. The manipulation in this tale is also characteristic of general Marghi behavior. Just as the hero manipulated his friend into choosing the wrong name, Marghi manipulate persons into offering desired ends. This is partly due to their belief that it is impolite to ask or take first choice, but it is mainly due to the belief that to ask is to humiliate one- self, to become dependent upon another, and of course to risk rejection. The abhorrence of being dependent upon others (apart from one's family) is constantly reinforced through tales which depict the unreliability of others. Time and again when the hero depends upon another he is disappointed by deception or simple failure. His success is in the end usually his own achievement. The hero himself is the prototype of loyalty more than his designated friends. Though children are their most prized possessions, Marghi regard them from a very early age as "modified adults," and children, beyond infants, are not indulged. They are treated as though they were grown, though of course, it is fully realized that children lack the skills, power, and status of adults. Consequently, children tend to be victimized though not severely-by their superiors. For example, one never pays a youth as much for a bundle of wood as he would an adult for the same bundle. This characteristic is also noticeable in the folklore. Children are used by their parents for their own purposes. In one case when a magical monster is capturing farmers in their fields, the villagers send their children to do the work. It is interesting, I believeS that there is no hint that this is inappropriate, nor do the children of the stories seek vengeance upon their parents. There are a number of seeming inconsistencies which may be inform- ative. I am not speaking here of the depiction of forbidden acts, which are not very numerous in Marghi lore, but rather to apparent contradictions or omissions of contemporary Marghi culture. It may be</page><page sequence="16">20 JAMES H. VAUGHAN that in at least some instances the folklore illustrates a prior culture. It is surprising that there are so few references to surrounding tribes in Marghi tales. This, I believe, is explainable in terms of a general absence of tribal identity. If we may judge by the other Mandara tribes8 and the histories of MEarghi kingdoms, the Ur-Marghi consisted of autonomous localized clans, suspicious of and hostile to their neighbors. Today some of the [ountain Marghi prefer to be known by their locale rather than the term S'Marghi," and all of the historic kingdoms have been as hostile to one another as to other tribes. Thus, their folklore, in re- flecting a lack of tribal identity in others, indicates an absence of their own tribal identity. This is an important view in understanding their political structure. One incongruity which I find surprising is a complete absence of references to mountains or the characteristics of mountain life. While it is true that they reputedly liave migrated from the plateau of north central Cameroun, this is nevertheless a rugged, rocky area. There are two inconsistencies of economic life which are noticeable. The first is the frequent references to starvation or, conversely, the over-emphasis upon food, as in the cases of the villages in which every- thing is made of meat and in which the people do not excrete. The focus on food is also noticeable among Marghi in the fear that healthy adults have of missing a meal, all despite the fact that they have plenty of land and can produce all their sustenance requirements with relative ease. Child training probably is relevant here, for though Marghi children are weaned late (2 to 4 years), it is usually accomplished through the abrupt withdrawal of the mother. We may also note that warfare has tradi- tionally resulted in scarcity, particularly when kingdoms were under siege by the Fulani. The second incongruity of economic life is the absence of references to markets which are today so central to Marghi life. It is difficult to tell if markets are truly indigenous; they are certainly firmly established today and have been for some time. They also occur throughout the Mandaras, and Lembezat too has puzzled about their antiquity.9 Surely they were less prominent in the past when travel was more restricted. In a way the absence of marked economic specialization makes them some- thing of anomalies. 8 Lembezat, pp. 7-61; Meek, pp. 252-327. 9 Lembezat, p. 29.</page><page sequence="17">21 FOLKLORE AND VALUES IN MARGHI CULTURE The folktales reveal no evidence of hierarchical political structures. The histories of kingdoms and some of the official titles would indicate a relatively recent development in this aspect of culture. This is an illustration of the care with which one must use statements which say that folklore sanctions the institutions of a society. The king and king- dom of Marghi folklore are at most rudimentary forms of the historic institutions. One other incongruity of social life concerns the rigid male-female roles of Marghi society. Marghi men are "super-masculine"; nothing they do is "feminine." Furthermore, they profess to know nothing of homosexuality or even masturbation, though they admit to beastiality, presumably on the grounds that it is heterosexual. This amount of rigidity would seem to entail some ambivalence toward females and require some projected expression. This may in part be seen in folklore. Several stories of my collection have the hero being forcibly raised as a woman and then marrying a male-in every case the marriage is to a king. The problem is then resolved by the transvestite changing into a woman permanently or asserting his masculinity and overthrowing the king. The latter solution is more common. In one instance the transvestite cuts off the king's penis, and in another the king kills himself. A further point which bears upon the matter is the common picture in folklore of conflict between man and wife. These themes may possibly allow the expression of repressed sexual anxieties and emphasize the dangers of marriage. There are few references in folklore to overt religious behavior. Even the theological system is scantily treated. Iju, as we mentioned, is re- ferred to passively, and the yal and shatar are only implicitly a part of some tales. However, religion per se does not constitute a clearly dis- tinct part of Marghi life.l° One could almost make a case for the absence of a distinct "aspect" of religion in Marghi life. The pervasiveness of religion in the form of a world view is so complete that its values and the values of folklore are one. The world view expressed in their theology is the matrix of life, and it is that view which is restated in folklore. No mention has been made to this point about tales of mythical origin or creation (as distinct from histories) nor to explanatory or etiological tales. In fact, I collected almost none. Although Meek re- 10 Vaughan, "Religion and World View of the Marghi," p. 395.</page><page sequence="18">22 JAMES H. VAUGHAN ports a creation myth,ll I never heard it, nor could I elicit it from any- one. The only etiological tales I collected told of the separation of men from Hu, why the dead are buried, and why white men are superior to black men; and all of these came from one informant. But let me state my position carefully: I do not for a moment think that Meeks tale is bogus or that one could not find other explanatory tales. Indeed, I remember once telling the story of why the bear has no tail which was received indifferently with the comment that they had a similar tale about the hyrax though it was not told to me. I return to some comments made at the beginning of this paper on the importance of a culturally representative sample of folkore. This is relevant llere because I want to stress that though one might be able to collect etiological tales, they are in fact seldom told. Marghi do not rely upon mythical explanations of the nature of things, a point which goes beyond folklore for in general they do not hypothesize about con- ditions. Rites and traditions are carried on because ;;that is the way we do thenl'' or "that is the Marghi custom." A persistent 'swhy' is usually answered "Iju9' (fate). The importance of validating myths is widely recognized among anthropologists. Malinowski enunciated it clearly, and Bascom suc- cinctly phrased the issue as follows? "When dissatisfaction with or skepticism of an accepted pattern is expressed, or doubts about it arise whether it be sacred or secular, there is usually a Inyth or legend to validate it; or a so-called 'explanatory tale'...."12 The tribes of the Guinea Coast, which are familiar to Bascom are replete with such tales. However, with the Marghi we have a tribe either lacking sucll tales or in which such tales are unimportant. This very striking absence led me to reassess Marghi values and culture. The result, I believe, is a more in- tegrated view of the culture which has predictive value and which sheds light upon the diSerences between Marghi and Guinea Coast cultures. Societies which place great importance upon legitimization and that is what explanatory tales do-may be characterized as having "consummatory vatue systems." In such systems the means of activity are as important as the ends, for they are institutionally sanctioned and as such are legalized and to an extent crystallized. The way one does a thing is as important as the end to be achievedS because the way is vali- Me.ek, pp. 221-222. 12 Bascom, p. 344.</page><page sequence="19">23 FOLKLORE AND VALUES IN MARGHI CULTURE dated by the culture. Or, as David Apter has put it, "the values asso- ciated with daily activity and the acts taken as a means of rendering those values satisfying are strongly ritualized and meaningful in them- selves.''l3 Societies with such value systems characteristically place a great deal of importance upon explanatory tales. Ways of behaving- the means to ends have mythical sanctions. Many Guinea Coast societies which place a great deal of importance upon explanatory tales seem to follow this model.l4 In contrast to these societies are those in which ends and means are not confused. Means are clearly secondary to ends and in a sense are justified by the achievement of desired ends. Such value systems are called "instrumental." In these systems it is less important how a thing is done than the fact that it gets done. It is a system which places a high value upon practicality and viability. Legitimization and ritualization of means is an encumbrance and incompatible with the system. Marghi values seem to fit this pattern. For example, they place no premium upon conformity in ritual; to the contrary, there is considerable in- dividual variation in ceremonies. Religious paraphernalia are entirely instrumental. When ritual objects are broken or damaged through ac- cident or negligence, no one cares; even the king's sacred staff is casually discarded and replaced if it splits from desiccation. They are ever pragmatic and realistic. A clear indication of the instrumental value system is apparent in Marghi political organization. That political structure, which I have only briefly described here, is also in contrast to those of the Guinea Coast. There the structure is pyramidal, whereas among the Marghi it is hier- archical. It has been pointed out by Apter that ideally pyramidal sys- tems with a multiplicity of legitimizing agencies characteristically have consummatory value systems. Hierarchical structure as we have already seen is characteristic of the Marghi, and their concept of government seems remarkably instrumental. The important political reality for the Marghi is the kingship; so loIlg as this end is unencumbered, changes may take place. In recent years a great deal of adaptation and adjustment among the political life of the Marghi has taken place: elections, uni- 13 David E.

VAUGHAN versal suffrage, political parties have all been introduced, modifiedl, and accepted, but the kingship remains.ls Although one might observe instrumentality of Marghi values in their politics, their religion, or in some other aspect of culture, it was first apparent to me through their folklore. An instrumental value sys- tem may explain why Marghi lore omits references to markets, moun- tains, and other aspects of their life. Certainly, the absence of etiological tales is consistent with an instrumental value system, for although such tales validate culture, as noted by Bascom above, they provide a conform- ity and an emphasis upon means that is inconsistent with ends-oriented cultures like the Marghi. Things are as they are because they work best that way. Elaborate validations of behavior, particularly in a mythical mode, are not only unnecessary but divert attention from what they con- sider the essential ends of culture. It is of course true that those ends, such as the kingship and the man-Iju relationship, are sacrosanct, but they are so firmly established that they need little verbal validation. It would appear that the instrumental value system of the Marghi will allow them an important measure of cultural continuity in the coming period of change. In conclusion we may see that not only does Marghi folklore comment upon the culture and perhaps indicate its pastn but it gives some hints of its future. 15 Vaughan, "Culture, History, and Grass-Roots Politics in a Northern Canzeroons Kingdom."</page></plain_text>
