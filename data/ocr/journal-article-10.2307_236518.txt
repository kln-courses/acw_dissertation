Studies on Ger- sonides: A Fourteenth-Century Jewish Phi- losopher-Scientist.

As is well known, anniversaries of the birth or death of important figures of the past often provide rich occasions for new and compre- hensive scholarly assessments. The 700th an- niversary of the birth of Gersonides (R. Levi ben Gershom [1288-1344]) was just such an occasion. Two international conferences de- voted to the life and times of this Jewish phi- losopher, astronomer, and biblical exegete, held in France in 1988, produced two fine anthologies of original and useful essays by scholars already known for their work on Gersonides and by several others in related fields. The first, edited by Gilbert Dahan, is entitled Gersonide en son temps (Peeters, 1991); the second is the volume under re- view. Studies on Gersonides focuses more on the scientific achievements of this versatile in- tellectual and thus should be of greater inter- est to the readers of Isis, although both vol- umes are important and they complement each other nicely. Gad Freudenthal divides his col- lection into four sections: Gersonides' astron- omy, his work in mathematics, the relation of his scientific work to his philosophy and theology, and two biobibliographical essays. The essays are generally of high quality and offer several new insights for the study of Gersonides' scientific project. The only per- spective relatively lacking is that of the "ex- teral history" of Gersonides' science, the social context of his intellectual world within both the Jewish and Christian cultures of Or- ange and Avignon. (Several essays in the Da- han volume partially address this subject.) Given my limited space, I will comment briefly on only a small number of some of the best essays in the Freudenthal collection. Bernard Goldstein has contributed more than any other scholar to the study of Gersonides as a scientist, and he appears to have been a guiding force in conceiving this collaborative effort as well. The volume begins with his useful synthesis of many of his earlier writ- ings, emphasizing Gersonides' originality as a thinker and inventor, along with his bold commitment to observation in challenging the views of the ancients. Jose Luis Mancha's study of the Latin translations of Gersonides' astronomy offers new information on the pos- sible collaboration of Gersonides with his translator, the hermit friar Petrus of Alexan- dria, revealing the possibilities of creative dialogue between Jews and Christians in fourteenth-century Provence. Tony Levy pro- vides an annotated French translation of two mathematical works of Gersonides. Herbert Davidson lucidly discusses Gersonides' un- derstanding of the material and active intel- lects within the context of earlier discussions of these critical notions in medieval philos- ophy. Y. Tzvi Langermann's treatment of Gersonides' views on magnetism and solar heat explains quite effectively the interrela- tionship of Gersonides' philosophical, astro- logical, and theological concerns. Gad Freu- denthal makes the connection between Gersonides' science and theology even more understandable in his important essay on the thinker's soteriology, epistemology, and as- tronomy. By elucidating Gersonides' reli- gious need to understand the heavens, Freu- denthal enables his scientific "realism" and his commitment to scientific progress to be more easily grasped. The volume, well edited and handsomely produced, concludes with a most comprehen- sive and usable bibliography of works by and on Gersonides by Menachem Kellner, offer- ing an indispensable guide for all future re- search on medieval Jewish civilization and its most original scientific thinker.

Vienna: Verlag der Oesterreichischen Aka- demie der Wissenschaften, 1992. OS 840, DM 120 (paper). Vienna manuscript 2372, dating from the second half of the fourteenth century, assem- bles the oldest known collection of alchemi- cal tracts written in a Germanic language. It includes translations into Flemish of the Tab- ula chemica by "Senior Sahid" and of the Liber secretorum alchimie by Constantine of Pisa. After a series of recipes by Gilbert de Laindrac comes the text edited by Helmut Birkhan, "Enech god jn drie persone...." This verse is a highly original document, and difficult to locate historically. Birkhan retains the hypothesis that the author's name might be related to the "Garsias" who is mentioned along with "Gilbertus" by Vincent of Beauvais. The question of sources is a vexing one. Book 2, "Salomon's Wisdom," purports to have been written in 1180 by "a master here in Paris, called filius philoso- phi." Although this text may well have be- longed to the numerous magical treatises that circulated from the late twelfth century on- Birkhan carefully traces the thirteenth-cen- tury background-the lapis-Christ parallel points to fourteenth-century sources. Birkhan convincingly argues that the poem is made up partly of paraphrased translations of several Latin sources, partly of original extensions. It probably originated in Ghent (as peculiar- ities of dialect indicate) and in a bourgeois milieu (one of the magic stones gives access to castles). The originality of the text lies, first, in its giving instructions in the use of magic for the production of the philosopher's stone, which itself has magical virtues. In general, the bulk of medieval alchemical tracts are devoid of magical elements. As the author's interest is entirely centered upon practical efficiency, physical theory has no place in the tract. Second, the cosmological frame is unique, entirely different from the more usual one found, for example, in the "Book of the Liber secretorum alchimie" (see my study in Mi- crologus, 1 [Turhout, 1993]). Here, the whole work of alchemy is projected onto the firmament, the celestial circles being filled with alchemical vessels. They bear such names as fumera and tenicula. The favorable or hos- tile influence of the 136 stars, playfully des- ignated as ato, beato, creato, delo . . ., de- termines the success of the alchemical operation. Birkhan gives a fine analysis of yet another, new cosmological feature, the Christianization of the sky (see also the stud- ies by W. Huebner). A third original feature of the text is the allegorization of the chemical process. The personified substances are involved in a pas- sionate drama of love, hate, and jealousy, leading to violent acts such as beating with sticks. The burlesque setting makes one think of popular theater. Surprisingly, Birkhan does not pay much attention to this formal aspect of the text; its analysis against the back- ground of fourteenth-century allegorical lit- erature would be worthwhile. As a matter of fact, the problem of rhetorical strategy is overshadowed by the extensive discussion of other fundamental issues, especially the problem of animism. According to Birkhan, the occurrence of personifications is to be ex- plained by a general tendency in human thinking to anthropomorphism, which he takes to be a "continuation" of animism (p. 60). My own view-to which Birkhan is in part responding-is that the acceptance of per- sonifications and of biological metaphors in alchemy does not reveal anything as to whether there is, or is not, a "croyance en la matiere animee" (Birkhan adopts Gaston Bachelard's position). The manipulation of spirits is an- other matter. As Birkhan rightly points out, the magical tradition present in this tract is quite distant from the sober Aristotelianism of the Liber secretorum alchimie. With admirable tenacity, Birkhan tracks down every possible alchemical text that might help throw light on the innumerable obscur- ities of the document. He makes extensive use not only of earlier texts, down to antiquity, but also of later ones. I cannot, however, agree with some of the theoretical premises under- lying his analogical method. Birkhan empha- sizes the-unquestionable-continuity of patterns of thought in the allegorizing al- chemical literature that originated in late an- tiquity, to which the Gratheus text is indebted (Tabula smaragdina). But to state that "few changes from the seventh century on" take place in alchemy (pp. 52-53) is equivalent to cloaking the history of alchemy in atempo- rality. True, late antique texts were transmit- ted to the Latin West via the Arabs from the twelfth century on, but they underwent thor- ough adaptation to a completely different so- cial and intellectual context. Moreover, a specifically Western Latin alchemical litera- 316</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS-ISIS, 85 : 2 (1994) ture developed from the thirteenth century on; this cries out for greater study. On the whole, Birkhan's edition is a major contribution to the history of medieval al- chemy. All of the manuscript's 175 draw- ings, mostly of stars, are reproduced as part of the text. BARBARA OBRIST Cornelius O'Boyle. Medieval Prognosis and Astrology: A Working Edition of the Aggre- gationes de crisi et creticis diebus. With in- troduction and English summary. (Cam- bridge Wellcome Texts and Documents, 2.) 92 pp. Cambridge: Wellcome Unit for the History of Medicine, 1991. ?6 (U.K.), ?7 (elsewhere in Europe), ?11.50 (elsewhere in the world) (paper). "Fame, fortune, and plenty of friends" were rewards promised for the study of medicine in the Aggregationes, as in several early writ- ings. A medical case, whatever its outcome, offered the satisfaction of deepening the prac- titioner's knowledge (gnosis) of its history, current condition, and, above all, future course. The Hippocratic-Galenic interest in prognostication, with the doctor in the dual role of judge and seer, shapes the substance of this compendium on the "crisis" or deci- sive moment of a disease and on the "critical days" that marked a turn for the better. Such days were determined by clinical observation (via experimenti) or by computation based on terrestrial variables and celestial constants (via rationis). Medical astrology is limited to so- lar and lunar influences here, in noteworthy contrast to parallel treatises that included zo- diacal projections and reflected stronger Ar- abic influences. Two further chapters, much shorter and in a different vein, offer a tax- onomy of morbid signs and instructions for reading them. Cornelius O'Boyle assigns the treatise to around 1280, in a context of translations from Galen that had increasing influence on med- ical curricula. Several manuscripts ascribe the Aggregationes to a "Magister B.," and O'Boyle is understandably tempted to in- clude among the candidates Bartholomew of Bruges, the subject of his 1987 dissertation. He realizes, however, that chronology makes this candidacy unlikely; one may add that current doubts about the attribution of several commentaries on the Articella diminish this master's status as a "prolific medical au- thor." The transcription appears flawless, and the minimal apparatus secures the readings (al- though I wonder whether no manuscript reads the more likely "essentialibus" for "sensu- alibus" on p. 82). The English summary, while it lacks the precision of a full translation and the clarity of a synoptic table, affords a view of the treatise's thematic scope and logical structure. This important text, brought to us without frills but expeditiously and reliably, is a boon for the study of medical teaching. LUKE E. DEMAITRE Paola Zambelli. The Speculum astronomiae and Its Enigma: Astrology, Theology, and Science in Albertus Magnus and His Contem- poraries. (Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, 135.) xvi + 352 pp., frontis., bibl., indexes. Dordrecht/Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1992. The Speculum astronomiae, the bibliograph- ical and methodological introduction to fun- damental problems of astrology, is one of the key texts for understanding thirteenth-century intellectual life. It is anonymous, but for a long time was attributed by consensus to Al- bert the Great; after 1910, following studies by Pierre Mandonnet, it began to be credited to Roger Bacon, although the manuscript tra- dition of the Speculum never mentions Ba- con's name; finally, Lynn Thordike tried to reattribute it to Albert. Questions about the authorship of the Speculum certainly contrib- uted to the lack of interest in the work during Albert's centenary in 1980. Paola Zambelli's volume on the Speculum presents an edition of the text with exhaustive notes and a commentary, as well as a dis- cussion of the historical and historiographical questions concerning the authorship of the work, its intellectual context, and its influ- ence. The historical material is composed of three parts. Part 1, a historiographical case study, is a detailed critical report of the de- bate on the authorship of the Speculum as- tronomiae that lasted from 1910 to 1955. Part 2 discusses astronomy at the time of Albert. This is a study of the scientific and philo- sophical context of the Speculum, comprising chapters entitled "Albert's 'Auctoritas': Con- temporaries and Collaborators"; "Astrology in the Early Dominican School and Gerard of 317</page></plain_text>
