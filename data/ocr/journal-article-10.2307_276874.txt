<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Clay Figurines of the American Southwest. NOEL MORSS. Papers of the Peabody Museum of American Archae- ology and Ethnology, Harvard University, Vol. 49, No. 1, Cambridge, 1954. x+115 pp., 31 figs. $3.50. The main purpose of Morss's report is to describe in detail a series of 11 elaborate unfired clay figurines found in 1950 by a local rancher cached in a recess of an occupational cave near Price in northeastern Utah. The pieces are believed to date from the 11th century. In attempting to appraise the chronological position and cultural significance of the cache series the author reviewed all of the data on archaeological occurrences and ethnographic functions of such items, and in bringing together these varied data he has per- formed a task for which everyone interested in the subject will thank him. The figurines, each approximately 6 inches tall, are elaborately decorated with fillets of clay representing hairdress details, ornaments, and clothing. All are painted, particularly with stripes on the face. It is pre- sumed that one figurine has strayed or been lost, since 10 are matched as male and female pairs, leaving one unattached female. The distributional survey of figurines takes up first the "northern tradition" (Basketmaker II, III, and the Utah-western Colorado areas) with the conclusion that the 11 in question are outstandingly elaborate examples of the Northern Periphery figurine complex and can be dated as of the 11th century. Next the "southern tradi- tion" (Mogollon, Hohokam, and peripheral western Arizona and northern Mexico) figurines are cited in detail with the conclusion that the early Anasazi figur- ines (Basketmaker II, III) were perhaps derived by "stimulus diffusion" from the earlier southern complex. Attention is paid to areas outside the Southwest, and Morss inclines to view the Central California figurines as historically connected with the "northern tradition" figurines of the Southwest. Western Texas, the Lower Mississippi, and Plains are surveyed, and Mexico as a source of Southwestern figurines is discussed with little result. The babe-in-cradle figurines are widespread and are suggested as evidence of an ancient and widespread increase cult, and the main conclusion of the study is that "the gynecomorphic figurines of the Southwest . . . are related to a human increase cult involving concepts basically unchanged since Paleolithic times, and not to an agricultural increase cult or to concepts of a Corn Mother or Corn Maidens." Morss sensibly suggests that the joint appearance of pottery and agriculture in early horizons may have offered a means for the production of imperishable figurines, and that there is no necessary functional linkage of figurines and farming through agricultural fertility rites. Altogether this monograph goes a long way toward synthesizing the scattered data and trying to fathom the purposes for which figurines were made. Newer data, accumulating ever more rapidly (EDITOR'S NOTE: see FACTS AND COMMENTS, this issue), and differences of interpretation of the cultural significance of miniature anthropomorphic figures will make the subject a contin- ually live one, but Morss must be given credit for hav- ing written the first major American contribution on the subject.

University of New Mexico Press and School of American Research, Albuquerque, 1953. 174 pp., 84 figs., 15 pls. $4.50. In 1938 the University of New Mexico Press published in its So Live the Works of Men series the original edition of this compilation of Hewett's reconnaissance and excavation on the Pajarito Plateau, west of Santa Fe, New Mexico, in the early years of this century. This volume had been out of print for several years prior to this revision. Dutton, The School of American Research, and the University of New Mexico Press deserve credit for making this work once again generally available. It is unfortunate that other, perhaps more im- portant, anthropological studies, such as Bandelier's Final Report, can not be reprinted. From a technical viewpoint, the Press has continued its high standard of competence. Two minor criticisms, however, should here be noted. A foreword by the revisor, stating her intentions, revisions, additions, and deletions from the original should have been included. There is, of course, always the question of whether the revisor should incorporate his or her remarks in the general body of the text, thus leaving the reader in doubt as to the original author's exact remarks, or relegate them to footnotes or parenthetical statements. Secondly, the illustrations of pottery vessels could have been more precisely identified as to type; and the list of illustrations in the original edition should not have been omitted from the revision. The new edition follows generally the same outline as the original and Hewett's easy style has been very little altered. In the Preface and Part 1 the author set down some of his "archaeological philosophy." While the writings of some early Southwesterners are not now considered in the best scientific style, many of them, such as those of Hewett, emphasized points of modern concern such as the inseparableness of archaeology and ethnology. In Part 2 Hewett describes the physiography and the major ruins of the Pajarito Plateau, and in a third sec- tion relates, in a not too detailed manner, his excava- tions there. It is in these 2 portions that Dutton has made most of her contribution. While little actually has been revised here, a number of worthwhile addi- tions to the original text have been made. Prefacing the site descriptions, Dutton briefly discusses the ce- ramic taxonomy for the region, and following each description she lists the principal pottery types of the site, with their approximate dates. Treering dates, where 194 [ XXI, 2, 1955</page><page sequence="2">As a report of excavations, the monograph impresses me most favorably. Wendorf selected 2 sites, Flattop to exemplify the earliest period of occupation in the area, and Twin Butte, the subsequent period. His exca- vations appear to have been carefully done, despite the handicap of uncomfortable climate, and they are reported in detail, with good illustrations of both the architectural features and the artifact types. Each de- scriptive section is followed by one of comments, in which the features or types are thoroughly compared with finds in other parts of the Southwest and, wherever possible, are also interpreted functionally. The result is a nice picture of the older remains in the Petrified Forest, their resemblances, and their cultural significance. In an introductory chapter, preceding the reports of excavation, Wendorf presents a review of current meth- ods of classifying cultures in the Southwest, which is to be recommended as a succinct, unusually dispassion- ate, and up-to-date review of the subject. In it, he proposes to use both the Pecos classification and the Gladwin-Colton system of phases (foci). He keeps the two quite distinct in the reports of excavation, using the Pecos classification primarily to refer to divisions of the Anasazi sequence and the system of phases only when referring to units within the Hohokam, Mogollon, and Sinagua traditions. In the concluding, interpretative chapter, on the other hand, he treats the stages of the Pecos classification purely as time periods and dates the phases of Anasazi as well as Hohokam, Mogollon, and Sinagua culture with reference to these periods. The reports of the excavations would have been clearer to me if he had followed the same practice there. Also in the introductory chapter is a brief but com- prehensive discussion of dendrochronology in the South- west, in which Wendorf concludes that this method is not very useful for the dating of phases in the present stage of its development. In its place, he proposes to rely upon ceramics and, in particular, to equate each of his phases with the corresponding period in the Pecos classification by the use of a single diagnostic criterion, such as neck-banded gray pottery in the case of Pueblo I. He justifies this procedure by assuming that pottery diffuses more rapidly than other elements of culture and is therefore the best "index fossil" for establishing contemporaneity of phases, especially in instances of cultural lag, for example, when an architectural pattern typical of Pueblo I time has persisted into the Pueblo II period. As Wendorf points out, this is a common practice in many parts of the New World. It is, how- ever something of an innovation for the Southwest, although the Gladwins come close to it when they line up the phases of their various branches chronologically by equating them with divisions of the Pecos or Globe classification. Using this approach, Wendorf concludes that the Flattop site represents a new, Flattop phase of culture, dating from Basketmaker II time. He assigns the Twin Butte site to the already well-known White Mound phase, which is Basketmaker III in age. The Flattop phase is characterized by pottery of the Adamana Brown type; small, oval to round, slab-lined available, are given. Ruins located within the bound- aries of the Los Alamos atomic facility and hence unavailable to visitors are also noted. At certain points where it is felt that the reader may desire additional information, references to materials published since the date of the original edition are made. The fourth, and final section of the book, which originally was called "The Debris of Pajaritan Culture," has been retitled, in recognition of the present-day residents of the Pajarito, to read "The Continuity of Pajaritan Culture." In an added part the development of the region from the founding of a private school in 1917 to the establishment of Los Alamos County in 1949 is recounted. Of more interest to anthropologists, however, are the data on possible historic and modern Tewa relationships to the prehistoric Pajaritans. While Hewett considered this, he did so primarily in the light of Tewa tradition, and Dutton has not, in the revision, utilized to the fullest the recent data bearing upon the question. While it is recognized that this book was and is intended primarily for the nonprofessional, the re- visor could well have outlined current opinions, especi- ally of Hawley and Reed, which tend to strengthen, in part, Hewett's attempted correlations. In summary, while many creditable data have been added, certain of the criticisms leveled by Spicer in his review of the original edition (1940, Am. Antiq. Vol. 2) are valid for the revision. For the "general reader," this work will provide enjoyment and some understanding and appreciation of archaeology. For the professional anthropologist, a more detailed analysis of material remains, correlated with those of subsequent excava- tions and ethnological investigations in the region, would have been highly desirable.

Shepard and special sections by Kate Peck Kent and Earl H. Morris. Museum of Northern Arizona, Bull. 27, Northern Arizona Society of Science and Art, Flagstaff, 1953. x+ 204 pp., 96 figs. $6.00. The Petrified Forest in east central Arizona is of importance archaeologically because it lies between the areas of distribution of 4 "cultural traditions": Anasazi to the north and east, Sinagua to the west, Hohokam to the southwest, and Mogollon to the south and south- east. Excavation in the earlier Petrified Forest sites might be expected to reveal significant information concerning the origin and interrelationships of the sur- rounding "traditions." In an effort to realize this poten- tiality, Wendorf made a survey of collections from the Petrified Forest in 1947 and excavated there in 1949 and 1950. His publication consists both of a report of the excavations and a discussion of their significance for the problem of relationships. REVIEWS 195</page></plain_text>
