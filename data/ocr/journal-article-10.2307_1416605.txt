<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS crime, for they have failed to formulate the causal problem in terms of the de- pendent and independent variables; nor can they tell us whether criminals can or cannot be differentiated from non-criminals in terms of any set of factors. Though the authors distinguish between the subject matters of psychology and sociology they have a blanket condemnation of research studies contributed by both. Many of the studies cited are not, of course, the work of psychologists. On the constructive side they propose plans for an institute of criminology and criminal justice to attempt a solution of the two basic problems, the theoretical problem of etiology of criminal behavior and the practical problem of control. They recommend that the kind of research that is now being done be discontinued. It is significant that in the criminological division of the proposed institute, psychologists and sociologists would be replaced by logicians, mathematicians, statisticians, and physicists, the latter for their knowledge of the basic concepts of empirical science. It is the contention of the authors that the psychologists and the sociologists, lack- ing broad philosophical orientation, adequate knowledge of the methodology of science and the instruments of logic and mathematics, "have shown themselves utterly incompetent to construct a science of criminology." An exception is made of the special field of psychometry where an empirical science is developing. A weakness of the book is its self-conscious attempt on theoretical grounds to place all psychology outside of the closely circumscribed "empirical sciences" with- out adequate consideration of psychological contributions other than criminological. This thought-stimulating book is, however, a challenge to psychologists, sociologists, and other students of criminal behavior. To such it is a valuable and, in the re- viewer's opinion, a very important contribution. Dartmouth College EDWIN POWERS Revelation in Mormonism. By GEORGE B. ARBAUGH. Chicago, Univ. Chicago Press, 1932. Pp. x, 252. This book constitutes an excellent case-study of the development of a sacerdotal religion. Of all the major anthropomorphic religions Mormonism is unique in that it is more modern, that the sources are observable, and that more critical attention has been given to them. In spite of the fact that the background of Mormonism has been considerably blurred and distorted because of the bias of early proponents or opponents, the mass of evidence seems adequate to characterize it. The author presents a very intimate account of the various expediencies of the pro- moters of an organized cult. The first part deals with the craze of a century ago in rural New England for the discovery of buried treasure and lost manuscripts of ?ancient times. This craze infected Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith and culminated in the Book of Mormon and several other books and pamphlets, and finally in the restoration of an ancient but lost priesthood and church organization. The second part deals with adaptive changes by which revelations became familiar and mundane, and were used by Joseph Smith to obtain for himself a monopoly in seership and social control. The third part presents a period of competitive and contradictory revelations, in affirmation or rebuttal of various claims of succession to the headship of the church after the death of Joseph Smith. A number of the resultant sects are yet in existence, but revelation, in the old sense, has been tacitly abolished by the larger groups and the heavens are again silent. The mystic element has never been prominent in Mormon revelation. The appeal 373</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS has always been in terms of economic and familial advantage, institutional sanction, and theological phantasy, rather than in ecstatic rapport with the Divine. It is notable that Mormonism has never inspired any important poetry, art, or music. The apparent service of this study is chiefly that it does a thorough job of as- sembling the available data. The author does not attempt a great deal in the way of either a psychological or a sociological interpretation of these data. He holds that the revelations were altogether the product of deliberate fraud, rather than of split personality as advocated by I. W. Riley. The obvious opportunism in them is cited in support of this view. There is virtue of course in calling a spade a spade, but on the other hand one can be too dogmatic about his categories, especially in regard to religious and spirit- istic phenomena. Deliberate fraud, self-deception, hallucination, and social leadership are, in religion, such a part and parcel of each other that they are seldom seen in pure form. A comparative interpretation is always more truthful. This fact is dem- onstrated by the author's own testimony that the defrauded, gullible ones became in their turn the defrauders. In most religions there seems to be a queer paradox of coexisting deceit and sincerity. There is an abundance of references to sources, and a valuable bibliography is appended. University of Colorado THOMAS H. HOWELLS The Gestalt Theory and the Problem of Configuration. By BRUNO PETERMANN. Tr. by Meyer Fortes. New York, Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1932. Pp. xi, 344. This treatise on the Gestalt theory is unique in its presentation in that the author does not overwhelm the reader by shoving the whole system before him at once. By a careful analysis of publications on the subject Petermann introduces one concept after another in their genetic order. By this method he is able to take into account the shifting of standpoints within the literature. Furthermore, it enables him to attribute the various concepts to individuals rather than to the system as such. Finally, Petermann's genetic method enables him to present systematic concepts in their inextricable relation to experimental findings. IWithin the last score of years we have heard much of the "new" Gestalt Psychology which is purported to have had its origin in Wertheimer's investiga- tion, Ober das Sehen von Bewegung, in 1912. Petermann shows that the principle characteristics of the "total situation" of behavior, which seem to constitute the groundwork of the configurational theory, are traced in their progressive develop- ment from Von Ehrenfels through Cornelius and Lipps. Other contributions to this concept are Benussi's "Production" theory, and G. E. Miiller's "Coherence" theory. After giving us a clear statement of the working principles of the Gestalt theory in Book I, Petermann summarizes the systematic field of the theory as follows: (1) The theory is not confined to psychology. Its essential principles are applicable to biology and physics as well. (2) Psychological Gestalten are essentially physical prototypes. (3) In biology the theory attempts to resolve the controversy between vitalism and mechanism. (4) In psychology, it undertakes to derive "the entire range of psychical phenomena from one unitary and determinate basal doctrine, in the form of a unitary theory." In Part 2 of Book II there appears a review of the literature on figural structures upon which the Gestalt theory has relied for empirical verification of its proposed 374</page></plain_text>
