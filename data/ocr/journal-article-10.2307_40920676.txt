<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Färg, fárg!"- Strindberg's Chromatic Language in Ett drömspel Mark Mussari Tucson, Arizona We dream - it is good we are dreaming - It would hurt us - were we awake - Emily Dickinson Ejtdrömspel ( 1901; A DreamPlay, 1912) Strindberg moves the associative value of color beyond symbolism thus helping to set the stage for expressionist chromaticism. His colorific language breaks with mimetic notions of time and space and attempts to recreate the ever-changing &lt;cchaos of color55 he speaks of in Des arts nouveaux! où Le hasard dans la production artistique (1894; cThe New Arts, or the Role of Chance in Artistic Creation55 1968). At times the play's colors function for themselves: the green of the Billposters prized possessions, She5s blue dress, the elusive green lighted area off-stage. In the description of Skamsunds strand [Foul Strand], Strindberg paints one of the first truly expressionistic landscapes on stage,1 a nightmarish place heavily dependent on black and red. The symbolism Strindberg had begun in Till Damaskus I (e.g. , the haunting seascape with three masts) moves another step closer to depicting mental states in Ett drömspel, as the playwrights visual sense paves the way for such future imagists as Eugene O'Neill and Federico Fellini.2 Especially in Ett drömspel, Strindberg institutes 1. See also the Asylum scene in Till Damaskus I. 2. Freddie Rokem observes that "in Strindberg's expressionistic plays we again find our- selves in the vast landscapes that have to be understood and interpreted as metaphorical explorations of the vast inner landscapes of the subjective mind" (108).</page><page sequence="2">48o Scandinavian Studies the expressionistic predominance of image over meaning- a hierarchy that has been turned on its head by late-twentieth-century critics intent on finding a "text55 within the image.3 The expressionistic sense that the soul is in revolt against any mimetic notion of reality can be traced through Strindberg to a strong romantic fealty toward one's imaginative capabilities in defiance of empirical approaches to existence. Within his artistic manifesto, Strindberg, describing the fantasy of creating sans adherence to chromatic norms, comments on some painted panels at Marlotte. He notes that "the colors had a harmony- very understandable, since they had belonged together in a painting. Freed from the pain of finding the right colors, the artist's soul had spent all its forces in seeking shapes" (99). As someone who always saw as a painter, he could not help but craft visually charged language. In an 1899 article celebrating Strindberg's fiftieth birthday, his friend the painter Richard Berg comments that "Strindberg sag pâ samma satt som vi inalare ser. Hans fárgstarka ock formkarga bilder stod lika levande för vâr inbillning som de tavlor vi med vara malarögon sag i den svenska naturen" (Söderström, "Strindberg" 74) [Strindberg saw in the same way that we painters see. His strongly colored and sparingly formed pictures were just as alive for our imagination as the canvases we saw in Swedish nature with our own painterly eyes]. Laud- ing Strindberg's painterly literary sense, Berg notes that Strindberg's pictorial eye is always present in his descriptive language. On the chromatic front, Strindberg's interest in the subjective power of color also surfaces in his derision of photographic realism in his Dagens Nyheter essay "En titt pâ Konstforeningen I-II" (8 March 1876). Strindberg chides this mimetic approach for being as boring as "en utgissad gâta, och man lyssnar förgäves efter den dar osynliga fárgmusiken" (205) [a completed puzzle, and one listens in vain for the invisible music of color]. One is reminded of van Gogh's wonderful "I couldn't care less what the colors are in reality"4 Strindberg's essay also reveals his own already enlightened color sense. He asks rhetorically: "Huru skall [en malar] kunna mâla . . . dâ han icke vet vad fárg är ?" (203) [How can a painter paint ... when he does not know what color is?]. Strindberg claims that judging the drawing in a picture is an easy task 3. In a Panofskian approach, for example, art is read instead of viewed; the visual is subordinated to the sign, the symbol. 4. Letter to Emile Bernard (18 June 1888).</page><page sequence="3">Strindberg's Chromatic Language 481 but that "fàrgen har alltid varit ett mysterium" (203) [color has always been a mystery]. In a nod to the French painters of his time, he adds that a revolution "i koloriten" has taken place in France and only in the past year taken hold in Sweden. In a Goethean turn, Strindberg even mentions the optical effect of seeing green on a white wall after looking at red (201). His insistence on the importance of color over representation is best made in a fictive dialogue between a traditional- ist and himself.5 Exasperated with Strindberg's unconventional eye, the traditionalist finally asks: ccVad i Herrans namn ser ni da?" [What in God's name do you see then?], to which Strindberg replies: "Färg, fárg!" (205) [Color, color!].6 In a later article (2 June 1876), "Konsten, det konstiga och naturliga," Strindberg calls color "malarens uttrycks- medel" (219) [the painter's means of expression] and asks rhetorically why this most important of resources is used so infrequently and not "riktigt" [correctly]. Like many early expressionists (the Fauves, for example), Strindberg searches for what lies beneath common temporal and spatial existence. In his 1908 essay Notes d'un Peintre, Matisse, highly influenced by the writings of Henri Bergson and his conception of durée, explained his own intentional movement away from impressionism in essentialist terms: Sous cette succession de moments qui compose l'existence superficielle des êtres et des choses, et qui les revêt d'apparences changeantes, tòt disparues, on peut rechercher un caractère plus vrai, plus essentiel, auquel l'artiste Rattachera pour donner de la réalité une interpràatim plus durable. (238) (Underlying this succession of moments which constitutes the superfi- cial existence of beings and things, and which is continually modifying and transforming them, one can search for a truer, more essential char- acter, which the artist will seize so that he may give to reality a more lasting interpretation. [39]) In Strindberg's attempt to peal away "superficial" reality, he also uses color as a pictorial/linguistic device to depict the essence hiding behind 5. In Strindberg och bildkonsten Söderström describes Strindberg's afhandlinpf as a Kierkeg- aardian dialogue between a realist and a romantic arguing about painting; ironically, Strindberg had sided at that time with the realist. 6. In Des arts nouveaux! Strindberg calls "Philistines" those who find modernistic paintings "incomprehensible": "At first you see in them only a chaos of colors, then it begins to seem, it resembles- but no; it resembles nothing.... the painting keeps renewing itself, changes according to the light, never wears out, is rejuvenated by the gift of life" (102).</page><page sequence="4">482 Scandinavian Studies mundane existence. Matisse derides painters who try to remove them- selves entirely from nature and insists that the artist must feel he has copied nature: "Et même quand il s'en est écarté, il doit lui rester cette conviction que ce n'a été que pour la rendre plus complètement" (241) ["And even when he departs from nature, he must do it with the convic- tion that it is only to interpret nature more folly55 (42)]. Strindberg, even in his most surreal moments, shares this sense of nature5s importance. Göran Söderström describes the technique in the dream plays and the pre-surrealistic chamber plays as the act of gathering together "fragment av verkligheten till nya fantastiska kombinationer, kombinationer med en ny, halvt fördold mening55 ("Strindberg55 106) [fragments of reality into new combinations, combinations with a new, half-hidden mean- ing]. Strindberg^ oneiric plays open the door to that part of life which the painter Paul Klee dubbed "the secretly perceived.55 In his essay "Om fárgen55 [On Color], Isaac Grünewald, echoing Matisse5s thoughts, describes the progression from impressionism toward expressionism7 in terms that parallel Strindberg's dramatic development from his naturalistic plays to the supernatural post-Inferno plays: Eft er den kulmen i naturalistiskt och realistiskt natumtergivande som äßde rum i Frankrike med impressionisternas insatspâ 70- och 80-talen uppstod hos deyngre honstnärerna ett kravpâ mer plats for känslan,fir drömbilden, ßruttrycket. (n) (After culminating in naturalistic and realistic depictions of nature that occurred in France with the impressionists' efforts in the 1870s and '80s, there arose among the younger artists a demand for more place for feeling, for dream imagery, for expression.) These thoughts may also be applied to Strindberg^ post-Inferno visual language, especially in Ett drömspel Though Strindberg had deemed himself a "symbolist55 at this point in his career, his imagery reflects the inception of a more subjective approach. In his introduction to Expres- sionism as an International Literary Phenomenon, Ulrich Weisstein cites subjectivism as the link between symbolism and expressionism but also delineates a telling distinction: expressionism adds "the turning outward in a violent projection of soul states55 (16). Characters5 mental states, their moods, take precedence in works in which reality is turned inside 7. In the late 1920s, Grünewald did set designs for Ett drömspel.</page><page sequence="5">Strindberg's Chromatic Language 483 out. If Gauguin (whom Strindberg knew well in Paris) was accurate in his attack on impressionism as an art in which thought had "no place ," Strindberg's visual language is the complete antithesis of such an approach. Especially in Ett drörnspel, thought takes center stage. As Strindberg's dream plays indicate, the subjective will plays a vital role in the movement toward a more expressionistic approach. Jan Jozef Lipski takes this notion further in an excellent discussion of symbolism and expressionism, one which has bearing on Strindberg's post-Inferno production. Lipski comments on the tension in expressionism between the human will, freedom, and notions of the soul, on one hand, and determinism, necessity, and matter, on the other. Lipski stresses a dichotomy: "Symbolism [is] a form of Platonic idealism, while Expres- sionism has its closest counterpart in the Hindu idealism of Sankara, as indeed one can trace its Indian antecedents- so fashionable in the modernistic period- to Schopenhauer" (Weisstein 300). The teachings of the Hindu metaphysician Sankara (circa 700 ce) reinforce the inner, subjective focus of expressionism: one of his central tenets is that the inner self or soul (atman) is identical with the essence of being (sat), brahman itself. The reference to Schopenhauer is particularly relevant. In Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung (1819; 2 ed. 1844), Schopenhauer had established his view of the external world as a "construction" of the intellect; the blind will to live is the "inner reality of nature." Relying predominantly on the image, Strindberg constructs that inner real- ity on stage. As Schopenhauer stated in his opening sentence: "Die Welt ist meine Vorstellung" [The world is my idea].8 In Strindberg's subjective, expressionist view, the world becomes a field of projection. Söderström notes "en syntetiserande expressionistisk förenkling" [a synthesized, expressionistic simplification] in Strindberg's post-Inferno scenes; realistic objects are exaggerated into expressionist symbols that "dominera scenen" ("Strindberg" 108) [dominate the stage]. Whether we are reading the plays or seeing them, these expressionistic signs are, 8. inParerga undParalipomena (1847), Schopenhauer views life as a struggle against sleep; a tired intellect results in a sleep filled with strange, senseless dreams. Gunnar Ollén contends, though, that "vad som främst skiljer Strindberg i Ett drömspd frân Schopenhauer med dermes förlamande pessimism är de inspirerade skildringar han gör av det som sedan ska konfronteras med sin motsats: kärlekslyckan, skönheten, godheten, det jordiska paradiset" (150) [what most separates Strindberg in A Dream Play from Schopenhauer with his paralyzing pessimism are his inspired depictions ofthat which is confronted eventually with its opposite: the joy of love, beauty, goodness, the earthly paradise].</page><page sequence="6">484 Scandinavian Studies more often than not, actually telling the story (or, more accurately, they are the story). Color serves an important function in the ideas staged in the post- Inferno plays, especially the dream plays. Bergson, in a lecture on dreaming first published in the Revue Scientifique in 1901, observes that "sounds do not play in our dreams so important a part as colors. Our dreams are by and large visual, and even more visual than we think55 (World 27). Strindberg reinforced color's importance in Ettdrömspel in a letter to the Intima Teater in which he suggested that painted scenery be replaced by "color effects55; he also noted that the red plush curtain could take on different shades of color merely by being lit from various angles. Evert Sprinchorn5s comment that Strindberg used the theater in Ett drömspel "as painters like Kandinsky and Pollock were later to use canvas55 (642) points also toward Strindberg^ heightened awareness of the importance of arrangement of color to any artwork. The musicality resulting from that arrangement to which Strindberg alludes in his note to the play also reflects Kandinsky's assertions in Concerning the Spiritual in Art about the connection between color and sound: "An artist who sees no goal for himself in the imitation of natural phenomena, even in an artistic one, and who is a creator wanting and having to express his inner world, jealously sees how such goals are naturally and easily reached in todays most immaterial art, i.e., music55 (36). In Ett drömspePs opening scene (i.e., Strindbergfs 1907 "Förspel55), Indra's Daughter's first observation of Earth, seen through the clouds, is related in chromatic imagery: Jag ser ... att dar ärskönt ... medßröna skogar, Med bläa vatten, rita fäll och gula gär den ... (163) (I see ... how beautiful it is ... Green woods, blue waters, white peaks, golden fields [650]). She views the world first and foremost in chromatic terms thus lending a primary quality (in the philosophical sense) to color. We cannot be fooled, though, by what appears to be conventional chromatic represen- tations of nature. From a distance the world may appear chromatically mimetic, with green forests and yellow fields, but Indra5s Daughters descent into the "third world55 is an incarnation in a non-naturalistic setting. An underlying irony drives the ensuing imagery: whereas it appears that Indra5s Daughter is a spirit taking corporeal form, she actually enters a world in which (as Richard Bark indicates in Strindbergs</page><page sequence="7">Strindberg's Chromatic Language 485 drötnspelsteknik - i drama och teater) time and space are frequently turned on their respective and connected heads. Indra's Daughter's journey will take her (and us) not into a purely material world, but instead into a fourth dimension; the vision of the world seen through an opening in the clouds is an inverted parallel to the cosmic opening in Strindberg's painting Underlandet (1894). A strong expressionist approach is also achieved in the bird's-eye view that Indra and his daughter share in heaven. The bird's-eye view constitutes a meta-view- the sense that a larger picture than the simple mimetic one exists. It also reinforces the subjective point of view by imposing a "bigger" order on disparate aspects of existence. In "Expres- sionist Literature and Painting," Paul Hadermann observes that in the bird's eye view relationships are "falsified by the painter or writer in favor of a subjective order. Distances are abolished in a desire for cosmic communion" (135). Strindberg's opening scene implies that there is a larger, cosmic view of existence more real than the one with which we are familiar in common time and space9- and that view is colored. He reinforced this notion in a letter to Emil Schering about the meaning of Ett drömspel dated May 13, 1902: "Tid och rum existera ej; en minut är som mânga âr" [Time and space do not exist; a minute is as many years]. The tall, colorful flowers that dominate the backdrop in the play's opening section further indicate the importance of Strindberg's chro- matic sense. As for many pictorial and linguistic colorists, childhood plays a dominant role in driving Strindberg's imagery. The Wonder- land-backdrop of "jättestora Stockrosor" [giant hollyhocks] points to the child's heightened imagination, a state to which Strindberg's char- acters struggle to return in the surreal shifting of scenes that comprise Ett drömspel.10 The flowers' size also emphasizes the setting's unnatural 9. Note the Magisterrfs question to the Officern in scene 9: "Tror du att tid och rum existerar? ... Antag att tid existerar, dâ skall du kunna säga vad tid är! Vad är tid?" (70) [aDo you think time and space exist? Suppose time exists. Then you should be able to tell me what time is. All right, what is time?" (696)], to which the Officer can only stand motionless, his finger alongside his nose. 10. The similarity to Lewis Carrol's fanciful work was in evidence in a 1998 production of Ett drömspel directed by Robert Wilson at Stockholm's stadsteater. In a review in Svenska Dagbladet Lars Ring notes that "Agnes blir ocksâ en Alices syster- det underland Wilson skapar korresponserar absolut til Lewis Carroll.... Agnes i underlandet" [Agnes is played like Alice - the wonderland created by Wilson corresponds completely to Lewis Carroll. . . . Agnes in Wonderland].</page><page sequence="8">486 Scandinavian Studies quality. Renoir once told Matisse: "When I have arranged a bouquet in order to paint it, I go round to the side I had not seen" (172). The strange feel of Strindberg's towering flowers takes us immediately to the other side of life. In "The Coherence of Ett drömspel /A Dream Play" Egil Törnqvist notes that the size of the flowers "indicates their anthropomorphic nature" (160), a subjective humanizing of a natural phenomenon (another move into expressionism). Some influence from H.C. Andersen's "Sneedronningen" [The Snow Queen] may also be at play here; like Carroll's Alice, Andersen's Gerda has a long conversa- tion with flowers about the whereabouts of Kay. Gunnar Ollén points out that in 1901, while he was writing Ett drömspel, Strindberg had reacquainted himself with Andersen's Eventyr and had been moved by them (127). The hollyhocks are described in a spectrum of colors weighing heav- ily on reds: "vita, skära, purpurröda, svavelgula, violetta" (9) [white, pink, purple, sulphur-yellow, violet]. An alchemical influence seems to be working in Strindberg's choice of colors (while in Paris Strindberg sought to invent a formula for making gold). The four stages of the ancient alchemical process were colored: malanosis (blackening), leu- kosis (whitening), xanthosis (yellowing), and iosis (reddening). Even Strindberg's use of "sulphur-yellow" hints at the alchemical process of incubation in which sulphur represents the "male" element. If we disregard Strindberg's "Förspel" we go from the blackness of the unlit scene (the first stage in the alchemical process) to the white, purple, and yellow flowers dominating the original first scene. These colors also appear in Strindberg's 1896 essay "En blick mot rymden" [A Look at Space], in which he comments on the visual effect of pressing against his eyeballs in the dark. He talks about seeing "kärvar av rött ljus" (354) [sheaves of red light] and När nu trycket minskas, upphör ljusfenomenet och ettfàrgspel börjar. I mitten synes engrop i Scabiosanspurpur, omgiven av ett miltsvaveigultoch liknande i teckningen en solfläck. Ar det da ögats inre som astronomen àterger i ord och bild.... Var börjar jaget, och var slutar det? (354) (As the pressure lessens, the light phenomenon ceases, and a play of colors begins. In the center appears a Scabiosa purple depression, sur- rounded by a soft sulfur yellow, and resembling a sunspot in design. Is this then the eye's interior, that the astronomer renders in words and pictures.... Where does the self begin, and where does it end?) The same purple and sulfur-yellow appear in the descriptions of both the hollyhocks and the color patterns in Strindberg's eyes (yellow and</page><page sequence="9">Strindberg's Chromatic Language 487 purple are also complementary colors, pointing to the many contrasts still to come in the play). If the colors have bearing on their counterparts in Ettdrömspel, then answering Strindberg's rhetorical questions in his essay, we may say that we have entered the play where the self begins, in the pictures of the eye's interior (i.e., the mind's eye). As Strindberg posits in "En blick mot rymden": "Och vad är ljuset? Nâgot utom mig eller inom mig, subjektiva förnimmelser?" (353) [And what is light? Something outside of me or inside of me, subjective perceptions?]. At one point in his essay, Strindberg even quotes Schopenhauer's contention that the world is a "cerebrala fenomen" (355) [cerebral phenomenon]. Strindberg's reliance on the red end of the spectrum in the play's opening also reinforces red's primary role among colors. In ancient and medieval times red was frequently considered divine, the very color of light; even purple's preeminent place in ancient Greece owes as much to its redness as to the difficulty in producing that hue. Strindberg's penchant for red (evident, for example, in the Rose Room in Till Dam- askus and, of course, his 1879 novel Roda Rummet) and its association with childhood also indicate the color's relevance for later Scandinavian literary chromaticists such as H. C. Branner and Jens Bjorneboe, who frequently employ red to express early consciousness.11 Later in Ett drimspel, whenifrm [He] speaks his verse paean to Fair Strand, He refers to the bay as the place where "jag drömde mina första rosendrömmar" (61) [I dreamed my first rosy-dreams]. Strindberg offers a range of reds in the flowers: from solid, power- ful red to the very weak pink and violet (Newton referred to violet as the weakest and darkest of colors). He also adds two colors associated with pure light, white and yellow. Still, the hollyhocks are earthly: they stand below, closer to the ground than the towering blue monkshood (which replaces the golden bud of the first scene).12 Color functions as the perfect meeting ground for a naturalist/ spiritualist mind like Strindberg's. As Leonard Shlain explains in Art &amp; Physics: "Color is the subjective perception in our brains of an objective feature of light's specific wavelengths. Each aspect is inseparable from the other" (170). Discussing the primacy of red, Shlain contends that red has always been the primordial color: "Of all the truths that humankind consid- 11. In 1963 Bjorneboe wrote a heartfelt defense of Strindberg against the Norwegian press: "Strindberg- den fruktbare." 12. Törnqvist feels that the bud and monkshood represent "Golden and blue: sun and sky" (i6on). We may have another contrast here, though: yellow and blue, the colors most identified respectively with light and darkness.</page><page sequence="10">488 Scandinavian Studies ers indisputable, it is this: The color red stands for vitality, energy, and power" (181). Green and blue play a significant role in Ett drömspel: their func- tion throughout the play reveals that Strindberg was well aware of the power of these two colors. In "On Color and Affect55 Ernest G. Schachtel observes that "the preference for green - and possibly also for blue- is probably closely related to the romantic and sentimental view of landscape55 (402). This chromatic influence surfaces in Strindberg^s autobiographical Tjänstekvinnans son (1909; Son of a Servant Woman, 1913), when "Johan55 makes his first attempt at painting by copying the landscape drawing of some castle ruins: När hanfick se den blaafàrgen verka som en klar himmel blev han grifen av sentimentalità och när han sedan trollade fram ßröna buskar och en grasmatta blev han outsäylifft lycklig som om han ätit haschisch. (339) (When he saw the blue color appear like a clear blue sky, he was moved by sentimentality; and when he later conjured up green shrubbery and a lawn, he became indescribably happy, as if he had eaten hashish.) Strindberg^s use of green in his paintings (cf. the turbulent Night of Jealousy, 1893) indicates his sense not merely of green5s powerful associa- tion with nature, but also its duality of effect: green can be restful and sylvan or elemental and deadly.13 The scene revealed once the backdrop of Ett drömspel rises consists of an opening onto an alleyway leading out to "en grön ljus plats55 (18) ["a bright green area55 (658)], indicating green's positive, springtime effect (the linden tree with the "kolsvart stam55 [pitch-black trunk] also has a few "ljusgröna löv55 [light-green leaves]).14 More importantly, this area is not defined nor is any shape or form associated with it. Instead, it consists solely of green light, i.e. color. Though Kandinsky contends that form can stand alone but that color cannot- it "läßt sich nicht grenzenlos ausdehnen55 (51) ["cannot dispense with boundaries of some kind55 (28)], Strindberg has come as close as he can to creating a pure color space on stage. Next to the Affischör [Billposter] rests "en Sänkhav med grönt skaft55 [a dip net with a green handle], and even the cloverleaf cutout in the door the Officer longs to enter implies a green space. Strindberg sets 13. This latter quality serves as a leitmotif among expressionists, with its origins more than likely in the more lurid paintings of van Gogh. 14. Kandinsky refers to green as "the most restful colour that exists" (38).</page><page sequence="11">Strindberg's Chromatic Language 489 up these spring-time colors to reinforce the contrast that will eventually emerge when the scene shifts to brown, autumnal tones and withered leaves (later in scene 3 and again in scene 5). Here, Strindberg functions, chromatically, more like an expressionist by using colors to convey feel- ings and to inspire those same feelings in the reader/observer. In the beginning of scene 3, Indra's Daughter and the Billposter discuss the human proclivity for complaining. The Billposter informs her that he has stopped complaining since he got the dip net "och en grön sump55 [and a green fish pot], a childhood dream. The irony does not escape Indra5s Daughter, who questions whether fifty years of waiting was worth a dip net and a fish pot. The Billposter replies: "Enjjrön sump, en ¿frön ...55 (19) [A green fish pot, a green ... ].15 The value of his seemingly meaningless youthful dream is captured in the italicized color green, with all its connotations of naïveté and spring (Törnqvist's contention that the green fish pot represents "worldly values55 [160] seems too narrow). The color is the thing, Strindberg5s character claims. Though it seems to leave Indra's Daughter nonplused, the Billposter's humble comment reflects Charles A. Riley's observation in Color Codes: "For the greatest of literary colorists, as for their compeers in painting and music, color is an element, not just a way of coding the map55 (222). Strindberg is well aware of both sides of that element. In the fol- lowing scene, the linden tree has been stripped bare of its light green leaves, the blue monkshood has withered, and ccsynes det gröna i gân- gens perspektiv höstbrunt55 (27) [55the green patch seen through the perspective of the alleyway has turned autumn-brown55 (664)]. The turning from green to brown carries traditionally symbolic qualities of aging, of passing from spring to autumn, reinforced in Eit drömspel by the Officer's dead, petal-less roses and his hair and beard, which are now^ra [gray].16 For Strindberg, some wisdom accompanies aging. A similar quality is achieved in the botanical metaphor and comparably phallic imagery of Yeats5s epigrammatic "The Coming of Wisdom with Time55: Though leaves are many, the root is one; 15. Even in the final scene at the fire, the Billposter refuses to give up the green fish net: "Affischerna far gâ, men sänkhaven aldrig!" (118) [The posters can go, but the fish net- never!]. 16. Much has been written about the Officer representing Strindberg, and these brown, autumnal moments in the play have an autobiographical feel about them, reflecting his then middle-aged perspective.</page><page sequence="12">49O Scandinavian Studies Through all the lying days of my youth I swayed my leaves and flowers in the sun; Now I may wither into the truth.17 When the Billposter returns, he reveals that his green net has not been "sã som jag hade tankt mig" (28) ["exactly what I'd imagined" (666)]. The Officer repeats the Billposter's words and praises him: "Det är utmärkt sagt!" (28) ["Perfectly put!" (666)]. The disappointment of fulfilled youthful dreams is reinforced by Indra's Daughter's chromatic observation to the Billposter: Dottern: Hur hade ni tankt er haven? Affischören: Hur?- Det kan jag inte säga ... Dottern: Lat miß sägaftl-Ni hade tankt er den sa som den inte vari Grön skulle den vara, men inte det gröna/ (29) (daughter: How had you imagined it would be? billposter: How had I- &gt; Well, its hard to say ... daughter: Let me say it. You had imagined it different from what it was. It was supposed to be green, but not that green! [666]) The colors we search for exist first and foremost in the mind. The imagination, Strindberg says through Indra's Daughter, sees and longs for its own colors in Ufe. Rarely are they found. Similar to his subjectiv- ist comment about the color of the Mourners and Pallbearers in Till Damaskus I&gt; Strindberg once again moves color into the jurisdiction of perception and away from objective reality. As Hadermann observes about the chromatic move from symbolism to expressionism: Not only do the colors of "vision" fail to correspond to those registered by the normal retina, but sometimes they also have a tendency to break away from their objects.... From here it is but one step to complete color autonomy, which is relative, to be sure, since . . . color often recalls the objects whence it originated. (132) Strindberg also joins a long list of pictorial and literary artists who have recognized the expansive power of blue. Like the theosophists, his sense of blue is Goethean: In color charts in Thought forms (1901) andMan Visible and Invisible (1902), Besant and Leadbeater claim blue represents high spirituality and pure religious feeling (see Gage 248). 17. The Irish poet William Butler Yeats was, like Strindberg, also fond of Swedenborg^ teaching and involved in the occult and spiritualism. Commenting on Strindberg's ability to innovate in many forms, Michael Robinson writes: "Of his near contemporaries in any art, perhaps only Yeats achieves something similar" (5).</page><page sequence="13">Strindberg's Chromatic Language 491 The blue monkshood that towers over Eitdrömspel functions not unlike the hyacinth at the conclusion of Spöksonaten; it serves as a natural symbol of a higher spiritual state. An unattainable quality accompanies the blue of Strindberg's monkshood. Shlain contends that Matisse was the great liberator of blue (as in The Dance, 1909), but the color's retreating quality has resulted in a long tradition, both pictorial and literary, of representing the ethereal, spiritual side of existence.18 The French avant-garde painter Yves Klein, who in the 1950s made a career of his daring, monochromatic use of ultramarine blue, once attempted to explain the color's potency. Klein felt blue functioned outside the dimensions confining most colors. Like many artists, he viewed colors as psychological spaces: "Red, for example, presupposes a hearth emit- ting heat. Colors always lead to associations with concrete, material, and tangible ideas, while blue, at the very most, recalls sea and sky, which are the most abstract aspects of tangible and visible nature" (78). Strindberg also associates sky and sea with the elusive quality of blue in a letter (8 March 1884) to his friend, the painter Carl Larsson: "Blatt är allt vatten när himlen är blâ! Min hustru . . . och jag hafva förgäfves sökt efter det der förbannadt blâ i lüften och i vattnet" [The water is totally blue when the sky is blue! My wife ... and I have searched in vain after that same damn blue in the air and in the water]. Strindberg's "kolossal blâ Stormhatt" (18) [colossal blue monkshood], which will bloom, wither, and bloom again, also has roots in childhood memory. As the Officer states: Den dar blâa Stormhatten dar ute! Den harjag sett sen jag var barn . . . Är det somma en?- Jag minns i enprastgard, da jag vor sjuâr ... det sitter iva duvor, blâa duvor under den dar hatten ... (23) ("that blue flower out there- that monkshood. I remember it from the time I was a child. Can't be the same one, can it? ... It was at the parsonage, I remember, the minister's house- the garden. I was seven years old.... Fold back the top petals- the pistil and stamen look like twodoves"[662])19 Finding "doves" inside the flower of a monkshood is a piece of popular Scandinavian folklore. As V J. Brondergaard points out in Folk qg flora 18. Note Goethe's remark in Farbenlehre: "Wie wir den hohen Himmel, die fernen Berge blau sehen, so scheint eine blaue Fläche auch vor uns zurückzuweichen" (io:234§78o) ["As the upper sky and distant mountains appear blue, so a blue surface seems to retire from us" (311)]. 19. A somewhat problematic translation by Sprinchorn: note the absence of the repetition of the color blue to describe the doves.</page><page sequence="14">492 Scandinavian Studies 2' "Venusvogn er bornenes mest beundrede blomst, sä vidunderlig bygget, sa rig pa fantasi, at de barndommens haender, der en gang har leget med denne fine blomstervogn aldrig kan glemme fantasiens flugt med de lyseblâ duer" (187) [Monkshood (Venus's Coach) is children's most admired flower, so wonderfully constructed, so rich in fantasy, that once childhood hands have played with the fine flowery coach, they can never forget fantasy's flight with the light-blue doves]. Thus, Strindberg's giant monkshood, appearing as it would to a small child, has more than a spiritual aura about it, thanks to its blue color. It also represents a classically romantic image of childhood's heightened imagination, the Blakean capacity to "see a world in a grain of sand." The Officer's blue memory is as wistful as the Billposter's green net and fish pot. Strindberg repeated this image in Stora landsvägan (1908; The Great Highway, 1981): Min barndomms blommor. Den blâa Stormhatt med tvà duvor i- . (195) (My childhood's flower. The blue monkshood with two doves within.) Ett dröfnspefs cyclical structure is reinforced later in scene 3, after another blackout, by the return of the leafy linden, the blue monkshood, and the green light at the end of the alleyway. The Officer, however, continues aging (in Sprinchorn's translation he is still "gray-haired," but Strindberg describes the character as "vithârig" (29) [white-haired] in the original).20 His longing to enter the doverleaf door, to reach the light, restful "green," remains intact (compare the French "mettre au vert": to give a rest, to settle down to a quiet life). Strindberg employs an expressionist tendency to use white to convey angst in his Munchesque description of 'the Advokaten [lawyer] : "Hans utseende vittnar om oerhörda lidanden; det är kalkvitt med faror, och skuggorna aro likvioletta" (34) ["His appearance suggests he has expe- rienced indescribable suffering in his life. His face is white as chalk and scarred with deep wrinkles, and the hollows of his face are filled with purple shadows" (670)]. Misery accompanies an achromatic existence: Kandinsky refers to white as the "Symbol einer Welt, wo alle Farben, als materielle Eigenschaften und Substanzen, verschwunden sind" (80) 20. See Byron's The Prisoner of Chulón (i.i): "My hair is gray, but not with years, / Nor grew it white / In a single night, / As men's have grown with sudden fears."</page><page sequence="15">Strindberg's Chromatic Language 493 ["symbol of a world from which all colour as a definite attribute has disappeared" (39)]. A religious connotation accompanies the Lawyer's purple shadows. The color most associated with Lent in the Christian church, purple possesses a confessional quality in Western culture.21 Indra's Daughter comments that she will not give the Lawyer her shawl to burn up all the sorrows it contains: "Inte an, min broder, jag vili ha den riktigt full först, och jag önskar framför allt fa uppsamla dina smärtor, dina mottagna förtroenden om brott, laster, orätt fanget, baktal, smädelser ..." (34) ["Not just yet, Brother Axel. First I want to fill it to bursting. Above all, I want to gather up all your pains, all the confessions you've had to take to your heart, of crimes and vices, false arrests, libels, slanders" (670)]. In Colors and Their Characters, Benjamin Kouwer observes that "in the Catholic Church [purple] is sometimes regarded as the color of repentance: sin (red) covered by morality (blue), the emotional desire for ideality" (129). The horrific quality to the Lawyer's white and purple face is best expressed in his (assuredly autobiographical) comment that the worst case of all is divorce: "Da är det som om det skrek in i jorden och uppe i himmelen" (35) ["A divorce case is like a cry from the center of the earth, a shriek heard in heaven" (671)]. The play's next allusion to purple is Indra's Daughter's romantic desire in scene 7, after her marriage to the Lawyer, for "en heliotrop," a flower whose leaves tend to be light to dark violet in color. Here, the purple flower functions as a sign for the impossible, a longing for beauty in the midst of what has obviously become a colorless and impoverished marriage. In Giftas (1884; Getting Married, 1972), Strindberg writes: "pâ spegelbordet lag Helenes bukett och sände dövande dofter av nejlika och heliotrop" (243) [on the vanity lay Helène's bouquet and the emitted deafening scents of carnations and heliotrope]. That the color is associated with a romantic state becomes clear in Strindbergfs letter (8 June 1904) to Harriet Bosse, in which he refers to "din fárg, det ljusaste violett" [your color, the lightest violet]. Color abets the flip-flopping of scenery that signifies the beginnings of scenes 8 and 9, as "Fagervik" [Fair Haven] and "Skamsunds strand" 21. Strindberg is fond of the notion of confession (see the Dominican Confessor in Till Damaskus I). In a letter to Emil Schering, he writes: "Säger icke Goethe i aus meinem Leben att heia hans författeri var en Confession" (25 October 1902) [Doesn't Goethe say in Aus meinem Leben that his entire work was a Confession].</page><page sequence="16">494 Scandinavian Studies [Foul Strand] exchange places in the reader's/viewer's perspective (a rather cinematic play of perspective).22 Strindberg's description of Foul Strand is undeniably expressionistic, particularly in the use of red, black, and white: "man ser till höger i förgrunden branda berg med röd ljung och svarta-vita stubbar efter skogseld; röda svinstior och uthus55 (54) [ccIn the foreground to the right are charred hills covered with the red brush and black and white tree stumps remaining after a forest fire; also red pigsties and privies" (684)]. Strindberg has again found a naturalistic object, charred foliage, aided by color to convey a mental state, a feeling of despair and angst. An aura of death also pervades the description. As Kandinsky observes, "das Schwarz ist etwas Erloschenes, wie ein ausgebrannter Scheiterhaufen, etwas Unbewegliches, wie eine Leiche55 (81) ["black is something burnt out, like the ashes of a funeral pyre, something motionless like a corpse55 (39)]. The red is dominant here, lending a sense of urgency to the disturbing scenery. In the distance, Strindberg employs the positive illusory connotations of white in the boats moored along the beautiful shoreline. In a letter to August Falck about a 1908 production of Ett drömspel, Strindberg suggested statues as emblems of Fair Haven and Foul Strand: "En hvit = Fagervik, En svart = Skamsund55 [A white = Fair Haven, A black = Foul Strand] . His choice of color extremes hints at the eventually disclosed sameness of the two settings. In a semiotic study of symbolic forms, Meyer Schapiro points out that black and white have striking features in common. Both are achromatic and extremes of brightness, and in these respects are interchangeable as symbols, if what has to be symbolized is an extreme state. Both black and white can convey the void of death. Either can serve as a negation of the vital, the growing, the natural. (47) Recalling Indra5s Daughters initial chromatic observation of earth, the reader/viewer can see that an effacement of color (as in the black Foul Strand and the white Fair Haven) implies an unnatural state of existence. In Ett drömspel the dreamy white imagery, like the green of the Billposter's childhood, holds empty promise on closer inspection. At first Strindberg creates a fairy-tale image in the scene introducing Han och Hon [He and She] : "En vit bât i drakform med ett ljusblâtt sidensegel pâ guldrâ och gyllene mast med rosenröd vimpel glider fram i sundet frân vänster55 (61) ["Gliding into the straight from the left comes a white 22. Freddie Rokem refers to this technique as a "turn-around" (120).</page><page sequence="17">Strindberg's Chromatic Language 495 boat shaped like a dragon, with a pale blue, silken sail hoist [sic] on a golden arm and a rose-colored pennant flying from a golden masthead" (689)]. Though white handkerchiefs call to the dragon boat from the shore of Fair Haven, the Karantänmästaren [Medical Inspector] waves a yellow flag as the boat is pulled toward Foul Strand. Kandinsky calls yellow "ausgedrückte] Gewalt ... die typsich irdische Farbe" [insistent, aggressive ... the typically earthly color]; any "Abkühlung durch Blau" [intermixture of blue] (here, the blue sail of the dragon ship) makes yellow "einen kränklichen Ton" [a sickly color] (37-8).23 He and She would prefer to stay in their white dragon boat heading instead for the unreal white shore of Fair Haven, but they are dragged ashore on Foul Strand. The reader learns that She also wears a blue dress, uniting her with the monkshood and the dream of a better spiritual life. When the Medical Inspector lights the stove, She voices concern for her dress: "O! min blâa klänning skall mista fárgen!" (63) ["But this blue dress will lose its color" (691)] (the remark is physically accurate: in blue light, the blue dress will lose its color). This effect is exactly what the Medical Inspector is after: "Och bli vit! Dina roda rosor skola ocksâ bli vita!" (63) ["And turn white! And those red roses will turn white!" (691)]. In the final scene, he must toss his "svarta mask" (119) [black mask], which he says made him act against his will, into the fire. Strindberg also comments on the factors that reduce colors to white in his essay "Blomstrens Hemligheter" (1887): "det finns även andrà omständigheter som reducera ner en starkare fárg till vitt. Lättast sker detta med de bla blommorna" (211) [there are other circumstances that reduce a stronger color to white. This occurs most easily with blue flow- ers]. On a spectral note, Strindberg concludes that this phenomenon proves that "den blâ fárgen är den sist tillkomna i utvecklingskedjan" (211) [the blue color is the last in the chain of development]. Because yellow ("den gula fárgan") most retains its saturation, Strindberg places it first in the spectrum. Strindberg reinforces a negative association with white: to remove all color from life requires destruction, a reduction of everything (and everyone) to sameness. This quality to white also surfaces in the beginning of scene 9 when Fair Haven moves to the front of the stage.24 Despite the white ships 23. Kandinsky also refers to yellow as the color of "madness" (for example, the walls of the yellow-frame house, behind which lie the schoolhouse, where any form of logic has broken down). 24. Törnqvist feels that The true significance of all the scenic transformations and trans- positions is that they evoke a feeling in us that we cannot trust our senses" (161).</page><page sequence="18">496 Scandinavian Studies anchored by the pier (including an ironic warship) giving the illusion of "frid och lycka i ferietid" (66) [peace and joy at vacation time], "hele landskapet är i vinterdräkt med snö pâ avlövade träd och pâ marken" (66) ["the landscape as a whole suggests winter, with snow on the ground and on the bare trees" (693)]. Strindbergfs snow is another device for defying time and carries negative connotations. In his 1902 letter to Emil Scher- ing about the play, he writes that there are "inga ârstider; snön ligger i sommarlandskap" [no seasons; snow appears in a summer landscape]; and, in his essay "En titt pâ Konstföreningen," Strindberg, discussing landscape coloring, observes that "det icke finns nâgon fárg i terrängen da snön äter upp allt ljus obrutet" [no color is found in the terrain when snow totally devours all light] and that "ögatt vämjes vid dessa ofárgade tapeter" (201) [the eye is disgusted by these colorless wallpapers]. In La terre et les rêveries du repos, Gaston Bachelard discusses the masking quality of color, its ability to express and conceal at the same time.25 The white masking of snow, Bachelard observes, also reflects on its obscure interiority. In the Riviera part of scene 10, Strindberg plays with this quality; the "vit mur" (80) [white wall] to the left of the foreground partially covers the "fruktbärande orangeträd" [fruit-laden orange trees] on the other side, offering only a glimpse of what lies behind the whiteness (the Coal Haulers never reach for the fruit, for they fear the police will come and arrest them). Throughout the play distance, both spatial and temporal, is mis- leading. Just as the Billposter's green fish pot could not live up to his childhood expectations, and marriage for Agnes and the Lawyer looked better beforehand, the snowy summer landscape of Fair Haven is a place of contradictions. Its illusory quality, exploded upon closer inspection, was reinforced in a 1998 production of Ett drömspel at Stockholm's stadteater in which the sets for both Skamsund and Fagervik were painted in a sad gray-blue indicating their sameness once the audience/reader gets past the flags and boats. A number of critics have commented on the importance of Fingal's Cave as an image for Strindberg, but little attention has been given to its chromatic rendering in his stage instructions. Although the sea has 25. Bachelard wrote in Uair et les songes: Essai sur l'imagination du movement: "Strindberg est écartelé entre ciel et terre.... Il est chimiste et visionnaire. C'est un être à deux mouve- ments, ce qui produit en lui une sorte de malheur dynamique" (71) ["Strindberg is torn between heaven and earth.... He is a chemist and a visionary. He is a being with two motions, a fact that produces a kind of dynamic unhappiness in him" (58)].</page><page sequence="19">Strindberg's Chromatic Language 497 been referred to as "det blâa havet" [the blue ocean] throughout the play, it is described as "langa gröna böljor" (87) [long green waves] sur- rounding Fingal's Cave (scene 10). The addition of a "rödmalad ljudboj" [red-painted whistling buoy] in the foreground recalls Strindberg's 1892 painting Ruskprick (Broom Beacon). In Ruskprick the heavy green waves covering the lower third of the pictorial plane have a stormy, elemental power about them. An icy blue sky, painted thick as an ice- berg, takes up the remainder of the canvas. The heavy green is offset by a thin red broom that, instead of bobbing out of the water, seems to be floating atop the entire surface of the picture; the broom's red shaft complements the ocean's choppy green waves. Söderström notes that in Ruskprick, as in Slätprick (Spar, 1892), Strindberg "släpper varje krav pa naturalistisk âtergivning av himmel och hav" ("Strindberg" 93) [lets go of any demand for naturalistic reproductions of sky and sea]. One senses power surging behind Strindberg's heavy green waves, and a parallel appears in the words of Indra's Daughter in her ccVindarnes klagan" [lament of the winds] : Gröna vagßor, vi vagor, Vota aro vi, och salta; Likna eldens lagor; Vât a lagor aro vi Släckande brännande Tva'ttandc, badande, Alstrande, avlande (90) ("Green cradles, wet and salt, shaped like flames, flames of water, slaking, burning, cleansing, bathing, spuming, spawning." [711-2]) That Strindberg has used green to evoke the more frightening aspects of nature (as opposed to the linden leaves or the green light calling to the Officer in earlier scenes) becomes evident in Indra's Daughter's apostrophe to the waves: "Falska vâgor och trolösa; allt vad pa jorden icke brännes, det dränkes- i vâgorna" (90) ["False and faithless waves! Everything on earth that doesn't get burned up gets drowned- in the waves" (712)]. Nature's insouciance is reinforced in the red buoy that "räddade sig själv, men lät den nödställda forgâs" (90) ["saved itself and let the souls in distress go down" (712)] and that is later described as looking like a human lung with the larynx attached. As the waves become truly threatening when the sea rises, they turn white.</page><page sequence="20">498 Scandinavian Studies A disturbing play of light and dark appears in the Poet's description of "en hed i snö, en exercished" (99) [a plain in snow, a drill field]. Curi- ously, this scene is related by the Poet, not illustrated on stage, forcing the reader and viewer to imagine the scene as it is described. The scene is most negative in the morose feeling that remains after the description. As the scene is dependent on the light from the sun, the Poet bemoans the appearance of a cloud which "släckte solens eld" (99) ["put out the sun's fire" (718)]. The shadow of the church tower has existed only because of the sunlight which "skapte tornets mörkerbild" ["created the dark tower"]. The long shadow of the church tower is eradicated by the dark cloud which "kvävde" [smothered] it. Strindberg has conveyed death not only in the Poet's claim that "den första vilken trampar pa tuppen mäste dö" (99) ["the first one who steps on the weathercock at the top must die" (718)], but also in his use of black/darkness swallow- ing white/light to express annihilation. As the Poet and Indra's Daughter (and we) reach the castle in the final scene, Strindberg chromatically turns the set on its head by moving blue from above to below: "marken nedanför Slottsgrunden är nu tackt med blommor (Bla Stormhatt, Aconitum)" (113) ["the ground below the footings is covered with flowers (blue monkshood or aconite)" (727)]. A chrysanthemum has usurped the blue monkshood's hierarchi- cal position, though Strindberg provides no chromatic signifier for the flower (is it gold like the original bud of scene 1 ? ) . The chrysanthemum's multi-petaled association with the myriad of faces appearing in the play's final moment, as the castle burns and the flower blooms, recalls the rose and the spiral of souls at the end of Dante's "Paradiso."26 The blue of childhood imagination and spirit has moved to the bottom of the stage just as Indra's Daughter is about to experience death and return to a still higher state ("till tronen"). In a cinematic turn, we are returning to the play's opening bird's-eye view from a different angle- this time from below, emphasized by the blue field of monkshood now beneath the characters. Color has once again abetted Strindberg's depiction of a soul state. Strindberg gave color a primary place in his visual world. In Strind- berg som bildkonstnär Söderström defines Strindberg's initial attraction to painting in terms of color's elusive power: "Vad som främst lockade honom var fárgernas förmaga till omedelbar illusionism, den skenbara enkelheten att i mâlningen ge uttryck ât en stämning" (21-2) [What most 26. Harry G. Carlson compares Indra's Daughter to Beatrice, who guides the hero of Dante's epic poem through the "Paradisio" (313).</page><page sequence="21">Strindberg's Chromatic Language 499 attracted him was color's capacity for immediate illusion, the apparent simplicity that in painting gives expression to a mood]. Color's ability to create illusion serves a central purpose in Ett drömspel. In the play's shifting scenes, heavily dependent on color to convey their tone and emotion, the image takes precedence. In a letter to Richard Berg (14 September 1904) Strindberg said of Ett drömspel: "Det var bara sciop- tikonbilder jag gaf Dig frân Furusund! Förvandlingsbilder, dissolving views! Men sä är val hela liívet" [They were merely projections I gave you from Furusund! Shifting images, dissolving views! But so is all of life].27 27.
