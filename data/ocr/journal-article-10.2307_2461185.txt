SPIESS Department of Biological Sciences, University of Illinois at Chicago Circle, Chicago, Illinois 60680 Submitted October 9, 1981; Accepted November 12, 1981 After the centenary of Darwin's book The descent of man and selection in relation to sex (Campbell 1972), interest surged in finding evidence for sexual selection. That surge has generated a sizeable literature. Some pertinent reviews are Blum and Blum 1979; Halliday 1978; Lande 1980; Maynard Smith 1978; O'Donald 1980; Parker 1978; Wade and Arnold 1980; Williams 1975. Those of us who were educated during the decade of the 1940s had the impression that Darwin's concept of female choice of mates in the evolution of secondary sexual characters was to be considered a form of natural selection. ("Choice" and "preference" are anthropomorphic attributes often applied to insects. For want of more precise terms, I shall use them but restrict their meaning to the following: Choice will refer to the selection by an individual from a set of alternatives; preference implies a bias for or against a particular choice from those alternatives. Preferences could conceivably be genetically or conditionally determined or be influenced by both genotype and conditioning. In order to be selective [i.e., to choose], a fly must be able to discriminate [to sense differences] among alterna- tives and to respond accordingly. A fly could sense differences and be dis- criminatory yet appear to choose at random if choices are made proportional to input of alternatives; in such a case the fly would appear to be nondiscriminatory.) Huxley (1938) criticized the female choice aspect of Darwin's sexual selection, bringing about its temporary refutation, and he coined the term epigamic selection to refer to one sex exerting selective pressure on the other, in contrast to intrasex- ual selection, or competition between members of one sex for mates. Neverthe- less we of the 1940s in overlooking shortsighted criticisms or modifications of Darwin's sexual selection began to analyze genetic variation as it affects repro- ductive success of both sexes, particularly in Drosophila (Bateman 1948; Merrell 1949; Bastock 1956; Manning 1965; Spiess 1970). When changes in frequencies of genetic variables within experimental populations were analyzed for fitness com- ponents of the life cycle, adult fertility and reproductive success factors were often found to be far more critical to determination of the selection outcome than early developmental stages or viability (Prout 1971; Anderson and Watanabe 1974, for example). We demonstrated the rare male mating advantage (Ehrman et al. 1965; Ehrman 1966; Petit 1951, 1958; Petit and Ehrman 1969; Ehrman and Spiess Am. Nat. 1982.

What the selective benefits might be to individuals with geno- types that control behavior such that choice or preference will be exercised in accepting mates is just beginning to be investigated. First we must examine whether prospective mates actually exercise choice or preference before we can proceed to ask about the Darwinian fitness involved in making the choice or the genetic basis for the behavior that may lead to choice. Females in many animal species determine that mating will occur by their receptivity to particular males (see references cited above); thus they become the selective agent for genotypes and traits expressed in males. When types of courting males are unequal in frequency, or rather when females experience courtship unequally from alternative types of males, females often accept the type of male lower in frequency, so that they mate with that type in greater proportion than would be expected from its incidence in the population. In fact, empirical demonstration of this effect now includes a number of organisms (wasps, Nasonia [=Mormoniella] vitripennis: Grant and coworkers, 1974, 1980; flour beetles, Tribolium castaneum: Sinnock 1970; fish, Poecilia reticulate: Farr 1977) in addi- tion to seven species of Drosophila (Ehrman and Parsons 1981; Ehrman and Probber 1978; Dal Molin 1979; Fontdevila and Mendez 1979). No doubt many other animal species, particularly those with polygamous mating systems will be found to express the same effect. In contrast, there are notable instances where experiments carefully designed to test the rare male mating advantage have produced negative results, including some of my unpublished work with Drosophila persimilis and D. melanogaster. Lack of advantage of disadvantage to the rare male type was observed in experiments by Markow and coworkers (1978, 1980), Pot et al. (1980), D. J. Merrell and L. Partridge (personal communications) with Drosophila, and Childress and McDonald (1973) with houseflies. These "failures" may be instructive in helping to track down any likely behavioral mechanism responsible and some of the genetic and environmental conditions that may influence the rare male advantage. How significant the advantage of rare types can be to evolution has been discussed often as an important example of frequency-dependent selection leading to balanced genetic polymorphism wihout a genetic load (see Ayala and Campbell 1974; Clarke 1979; Spiess 1977). In such discussions, details of how the sexes may discriminate among individuals of opposite sex for mates have not been considered; such details have been regarded as belonging to the realm of behavioral investiga- tion rather than population genetics; it has been sufficient for population genetic expectations to demonstrate the magnitude and consistency of frequency de- pendency. Nevertheless it is necessary to know by what mechanisms) a female fly chooses her mate, and once having discovered and described the mechanisms) we should have new insight not only into the evolutionary significance of the rare male effect but also into more fundamental questions concerning the consequences of mate choice. It is my intention to argue that the rare male mating advantage is a secondary effect. Its significance lies in the fact that it demonstrates discrim-</page><page sequence="3">DO FEMALE FLIES CHOOSE THEIR MATES? 677 inatory ability on the part of females, and I judge that we need to evaluate that ability for its Darwinian fitness, how genotypes and conditions determine and modify its expression, and how it operates in the evolution of mate recognition systems and the efficiency of mating as a focal point in the life cycle. Expressions and arguments that try to find evolutionary reasons for females' preference to- wards rare males "put the cart before the horse"; they divert our attention from the main point. (Nevertheless Lacy [1979] is correct when he points out that the net fitness of offspring from females mating with rare males would be greater than from females mating with common males when heterozygotes have fitness superiority.) Tests with several pairs of flies in which rare male advantage is to be analyzed for overall mating combinations do not by themselves reveal sufficient detail of female discriminatory ability; such tests in which large groups of flies must be collected are time consuming, and they do not elucidate the mechanism or the evolutionary significance of the causative factor. We should devise ways to test individual females, measuring this ability, its genetic basis, and its norm of reaction. (It goes without saying that male flies might also possess discriminatory ability to some extent and deserve to be investigated similarly as done notably by Wood and Ringo [1980], but female flies generally control whether a mating will take place.) I find in the recent literature that devotees of the rare male testing techniques tend "to stick to a single track" as if that were the only or best method for experimenting with fly discriminatory behavior (Dal Molin 1979; Fontdevila and Mendez 1979). We need to switch to new and hopefully more favorable methods for exploring details of sexual selection in Drosophila. First, I shall review briefly a working hypothesis of fly mating choice. Second, I shall summarize some recent experi- ments that test single females courted by alternative types of males. Thereby the working hypothesis may be improved to include concepts of conditioning the females and demonstrating their discriminating ability. Extension of this work to explore some effects of genetic background and environmental conditions on female discriminating ability will illustrate techniques by which individual females may be tested. I shall discuss an important alternative model that has been applied to rare male advantage tests, namely that of O'Donald (1977, 1980) concerning type preferences of females. Some cases fail to demonstrate any advantage to rare males, and some possible explanations for those failures can be considered; at least I want to encourage further exploration. I shall speculate a bit based on these results about discriminatory ability as a fitness character and how it might evolve through stages leading to ethological isolation between genetic systems. REVIEW Slightly modified from the original (Spiess 1968), my current working hypothe- sis is: When a population of virgin flies consists of females with two types of males in unequal frequencies, females "recognize" that alternative types of males are present and the females' receptivity changes in favor of the males that they experience as the less frequent of the two types. I arrived at the likelihood of this conclusion by varying frequencies of alternative types (AR and PP arrangements</page><page sequence="4">678 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST of Drosophila pseudoobscura) among males or females in separate tests with the opposite sex frequencies held constant at 50% of each type. The rare type advantage was achieved only when frequencies were varied among the males. Similarly Ehrman (Ehrman and Spiess 1969; Ehrman 1970), by using a double chamber technique, demonstrated that males introduced in the lower portion could either nullify the rare advantage in the upper chamber or induce the advan- tage depending on whether the extra males compensated for a minority above (1969) or added enough to upset an equality of types above (1970). Females introduced in the lower chamber had no effect. Thus it could be concluded that females were the selective agent in the choice of male types and that signals from courting males could be communicated to females without direct contact. ALTERNATIVE MECHANISM: O DONALD S TYPE PREFERENCE IN FEMALES If female receptivity does not change after courtship experience but is fixed by a genetically programmed constant preference for one type of male or the other, it can easily be shown (O'Donald 1977, 1980) that when two types of male are varied in frequency, the amount of mating to each type of male is frequency dependent with the rarer type gaining an advantage. In other words, rare male favoritism would amount to an artifact of proportionality, if female type preferences exist and are constants. For example, assume there are two kinds of females, (1) those with preferences (for either type A or type B among the males) and (2) those that mate at random, according to proportions of types A and B among the courting males. Further, assume males are polygamous so that any male can mate with more than one female. Let a = frequency of females preferring to mate with A males; 0 = frequency of females preferring to mate with B males; u = input frequency of A males; v = input frequency of B males; (1 - a - 0) = frequency of randomly mating females. A numerical example will help clarify the situation: If a = 0 = 0.20 and u = 0.10, v = 0.90, then 0.40 of females will display preferences in mating and 0.60 will mate randomly. The matings will be as follows: x A males: 0.20 + 0.10(0.60) = 0.26 matings; x B males: 0.20 + 0.90(0.60) = 0.74 matings. Thus A males will mate 2.6 times as much as their input, while B males mate only 0.82 as much as theirs. If the inputs were reversed, the outcome would favor B males by the same amount. According to this model, if preference parameters were to be unequal, there would be an advantage to the rarer male as long as the following inequality holds: u/v &lt; a/O. No change in female receptivity toward either type of male would occur in this model, yet the outcome will be frequency dependent favoring the rare male. O'Donald proceeded to apply the maximum</page><page sequence="5">DO FEMALE FLIES CHOOSE THEIR MATES? 679 likelihood method to estimate the constant female preferences that he postulated would explain data from empirical studies (Ehrman 1967; Ehrman and Spiess 1969; Spiess 1968; Spiess and Spiess 1969). It remained for a behavioral analysis to resolve the controversy of interpretation which I now hope to clarify. EXPERIMENTS WITH SINGLE FEMALES (BROWN EYE MUTANTS OF Drosophila melanogaster) The main problem was, How do females recognize two kinds of male and then favor the rarer type? [Using data from Spiess and Schwer (1978), Spiess and Kruckeberg (1980), and Wasserman (1976) 1 determined that at least three hypoth- eses could be eliminated when females courted by a small number of males were being tested:] (1) The female does not mate with the rarer male immediately, that is, she does not recognize him first "across a crowded room" when courtship starts and then choose him immediately. (On the contrary, she tends to reject him if he courts first.) (2) The rare male does not compensate for his rarity by increasing his courtship in order to succeed. (Rare males that mated had no significant increase in courtship over those that failed to mate.) (3) The female probably does not become sufficiently habituated to the majority males' cues, as proposed by Spiess and Spiess (1969) to account for the rare male's advantage; at least we do not need to invoke sensory habituation to account for the advantage. We found what appeared to be a reliable model system for analysis in a pair of alleles at the brown eye locus (bw, 104.5 on chromosome 2 in D. melanogaster, and bw 75) combined with scarlet (st, 44.0, chromosome 3). With bw 75; st, homozy- gotes have red (R) eye color while heterozygotes bw 75/bw; st have orange (0) eye color. What proved to be the most important observation was uncovered as we asked the question, Is the rare male successful irrespective of whether he was first to court or later to court? The answer (apparent in an earlier case, Spiess and Schwer [1978]) was most clear from data of Spiess and Kruckeberg (1980). The female tends to mate with the type of male that is not first to court about 80% of the time, irrespective of the input ratio. At an equality ratio (3: 3), the female receives stimuli in approximately equal amounts from both types of male so that we can rule out sensory habituation to cues from the majority (possibility 3 above). It is evident that the result is not in conflict with the working hypothesis, namely that the female tends to distinguish the two types of male and either avoids the signals from the first to court or simply chooses to mate with a male different from the first one. The female is apparently conditioned by the signals from the first male. Her usual initial response is to refuse to mate. Though she is probably receptive hormonally, she has a nervous threshold to be lowered by courtship activity, and by hesitating she samples more than one male. When a male of the majority type tends to court first, he tends to be rejected. The R and 0 males were found to differ in courtship sequence duration and wing vibration bout length, traits which are some of the elements in the mate recognition cues by which females may distinguish the two types of males courting.</page><page sequence="6">680 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST TABLE 1 A SIMPLE MODEL TO FIT THE MATING DATA OF SPIESS AND KRUCKEBERG (1980), TABLE 5, FIRST MALE TO COURT Model: Let u, v = input frequencies of R and 0 males, respectively d = proportion of females discriminating against type of male first to court (1 - d) = proportion of females mating randomly Females mating: R males 0 males Discriminating: dv du Random: (1 - d)u (1 - d)v Total matings: d (I - 2u) + u d(l - 2v) + v Example values: assume d = 0.80 Ratio Input Percentage Females Model Predicts Observed R :0 u(100) v(100) Mating Matings Matings XRd x 0 xR d xO 3:3 50 50 Discriminating: 40 40 Random: 10 10 Total 50 50 56 44 5:1 83.3 16.7 Discriminating: 13.3 66.7 Random: 16.7 3.3 Total 30.0 70.0 30 70 1:5 16.7 83.3 Discriminating: 66.7 13.3 Random: 3.3 16.7 Total 70.0 30.0 74 26 A SIMPLE MODEL OF AVOIDANCE The simplest model to fit these observed mating frequencies (Spiess and Kruck- eberg 1980, table 5, first male to court), using the principle that a proportion of the females is conditioned against mating to the first male to court, can be expressed as in table 1. Let u, v = input frequencies of R and 0 males, respec- tively, and d = the proportion of females that becomes conditioned by the first male to court so that they mate with the opposite type (discriminating), and (1 - d) = the remaining proportion of females (random mating). Assume that first courtships occur in frequencies equal to the input male frequencies. (This as- sumption is reasonably valid from the data cited, though R males court first slightly more than their input frequency throughout all ratios.) Discriminating females (d fraction) conditioned against the first type of male to court will tend to mate with the opposite type (frequencies of dv by R males and du by 0 males). Matings observed then conform closely to the model's predictions. We should note that this model has certain similarities to O'Donald's (1977), described above; but the causes and consequences of these models are in marked contrast. This avoidance model (table 1) proposes a constant proportion of fe- males conditioned against the type of male first to court. The O'Donald model</page><page sequence="7">DO FEMALE FLIES CHOOSE THEIR MATES? 681 proposes innate preferences toward each type of male, but I propose that courtship experience changes the female's receptivity toward the types of males present. Under courtship conditioning females may regulate the mating outcome depending on male input, but the preference model has fixed components pre- scribed for any male variants. No doubt the constancy of these parameters in the avoidance model is an oversimplification of the real process, but the close agree- ment with observed mating frequency does indicate that at least a major parameter is ascertained. REPEATABILITY OF SINGLE FEMALE TESTS: GENETIC BACKGROUND AND OTHER CONDITIONS About two years after termination of experiments by Kruckeberg, I planned further experiments to learn more about female discriminatory ability and its consequences to the population, but after a few initial tests I rediscovered to my distress the old adage: "Never repeat a successful experiment!" First attempts to confirm the earlier results indicated that either the strains of mutants (kept as double mutants bw; St and bw75; st) or conditions or both had changed, because the level of avoidance was less than before. I repeated experiments with single females courted by equal numbers of the two types of male (3 R: 3 0) as done previously (Spiess 1981). My objective was to find a set of genetic and environ- mental conditions that would approximate Kruckeberg's observed result; namely, about 70% to 80% of females discriminate against the male type first to court. Four sets of conditions were used: (1) mutants "off the shelf"; (2) mutants outcrossed to a wild type strain and recombinants tested; (3) mutants used as in (1) but males stored either with R and 0 together in lots of 3: 3 or separately and then aspirated 3 R: 3 0 into a mating vial; and (4) double outcross of mutant strains to three wild strains with recombinants R and 0 extracted and tested. The two storage condi- tions for males in experiment 3 were meant to test the following. If males of each eye color differed in some property such as odor, the difference in that property would be expected to lessen by storage together so that females would be less able to distinguish between them than if they were stored separately. Outcrossing to wild-type strains (experiments 2 and 4) incorporated more heterozygosity into the genetic background. If females were distinguishing males from courtship experi- ence and being conditioned by the first to court, a test of random acceptance (equal mating to either first or second to court) would be contradicted by a significant excess of one type, provided that both types had equal opportunity for courtship. Details of procedures and results are given in Spiess (1981). A brief summary of results follows. Experiments 1 and 2 indicated some negative association between the type of male first to court and the type that mated for those tests in which both males courted. For tests in which just one type courted, the female had presumably no opportunity to distinguish the two types of male present. These tests included two sorts of trials: (1) those in which the female was so receptive that she mated to the first courting male after three or fewer bouts (low threshold female), and (2) those in which the female had a moderate to high threshold but all three males of one</page><page sequence="8">682 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST type failed to court. These two sorts of trials constituted about 46% of all matings in both experiments. Possible bias introduced by excluding these "one type only courting" trials will be discussed later under type preferences. Matings to the second type to court were greater (64%) than the expected proportion (50%) by about the same amount for both experiments, but the frequency was less than that observed by Kruckeberg (80%). It is apparent that crossing mutants off the shelf or outcrossing to just one wild-type strain did not restore the previously observed discrimination frequency. In experiment 3, R and 0 males stored together produced fewer matings to the second to court (37.5%) than to the first (62.5%), though the difference is not significant (P = .12, X2 = 2.3); when male types were stored separately, females accepted each type of courting male about equally (51% to second courters, 49% to first). Thus there was no favoring of second courting males in either case though there was an apparent increase in the separate storage condition compared with the first, but again the difference is not significant. Results within each storage condition were homogeneous among the R and 0 females' acceptance, however, so that such tests may well be worth reinvestigation. Experiment 4, with genetic background contributed from three wild strains, used separate storage conditions for the two types of males and were carried on through three successive generations of backcrossed progenies plus a repeat of the parental cross as a control for the inbred generations. For the parent generation, its repeat, and first generation progeny in which both types of male courted, there was a consistent excess of matings by the second type of male to court (74%), a proportion of the same magnitude as that observed by Kruckeberg (1978). The mildly inbred generations (G2 and G3) contrasted in that first and second courting males mated equally. Thus inbreeding led to random acceptance by females while incorporating heterozygosity from three wild strains was associated with females' discrimination against the first type of male to court. The possibility remains also that one or more of the wild strains into which the mutants were outcrossed could have contributed some factor(s) before recombination in G2 that may control the specific behavioral trait observed. IS EITHER "VIGOR OR TYPE PREFERENCE A FACTOR IN FEMALE DISCRIMINATION? While we cannot yet answer the question of what a female fly looks for, listens for, smells for, or otherwise senses in her prospective mate before accepting him, there are some anthropomorphisms in the literature and a counterargument to the notion of preference that need discussion. First, the word "vigor" is often in- voked to explain mating models (Kence and Bryant 1978; Bryant et al. 1980) or proposed as a predominant factor in a female's choice of mate. For example, O'Donald stated (1980, p. 31), "Males whose courtship is more vigorous and intense produce more sexual stimuli: they will more rapidly raise a female's level of stimulation, and thus elicit her response." "Vigor" implies an intrinsic metabolic property and is not clearly defined. Some data from Kruckeberg (1978), given in table 2 as one way for measuring vigor (that is, by relative amount of time spent in courtship [number of bouts or length of bouts or both]), demonstrate that</page><page sequence="9">DO FEMALE FLIES CHOOSE THEIR MATES? 683 TABLE 2 RELATIVE TIME SPENT IN COURTSHIP ("vigor") VERSUS MATING SUCCESS (data from Kruckeberg 1978, in 3 R :3 0 males) GREATER MATING TIME IN X2 CON- COURTSHIP* R 0 TOTAL TINGENCY With R female: ........R 21.5** 17 38.5 .23, NS o 5.5** 6 11.5.2,N Total 27 23 With 0 female: ........R 17 15 32 .87, NS o 12 6 18 .7N Total 29 21 * More courtship bouts or longer bouts or both in total time. ** One trial with both types of male spending equal time. this vigor has no association with mating success. 0 males were less "vigorous," but their mating frequency is nearly equal to that of R males. A contingency chi-square test is nearly zero when applied either to the outcome with R females or with 0 females. In addition it is my observation that males tend to increase their courtship when continuously rejected by recalcitrant females, but the increase usually gives them no advantage. In Hawaiian picture-wing species, Drosophila silvestris (Spiess and Carson 1981), wild-caught males courted about half as much as laboratory strain males but achieved more matings. Thus vigor in courtship does not seem to be important to the female, as long as the male achieves some minimum amount of signals in conformity with the mate recognition system of the species. I want to emphasize that a constant difference between two types of males which might be construed by an observer as a difference in vigor could be recognized by females and thus effect a rare male mating advantage to either the high or the low vigor type. If one sort of male is injured artificially by having a wing damaged, for example, so that its effective courtship is reduced, I would expect the rare male advantage or the avoidance of first to court type to be demonstrable. Thus any condition recognizable to females as a courtship dif- ference between males would be expected to produce the rare male effect, as long as the females are discriminating. A potentially serious issue has been pointed out in a personal communication from Linda Partridge (University of Edinburgh). In my interpretation of the experiments described (that females are conditioned by the type of first courting male), I have not given due consideration to the preference hypothesis of O'Donald. In fact by discarding the trials where only a single type of male courted (Kruckeberg's experiments), a bias may well have been introduced that would favor my interpretation. Suppose that some or all of the females are programmed for preferences toward one or the other eye color type male; further, suppose females having preference for R males are more frequent than females preferring 0 males. If an R male courts first, a female that prefers R will tend to mate with</page><page sequence="10">684 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST TABLE 3 COMPARISON OF R MALE MATING FREQUENCIES (percentage) IN TRIALS IN WHICH ONLY ONE TYPE OR BOTH TYPES OF MALE COURTED EXPERIMENT COURTING 1 2 3 4 One type male .......... ..... 75.8 70.2 83.8 69.1 N = 62 N = 47 N=68 N = 123 Both types male ......... ..... 65.7 69.2 72.1 64.9 N = 70 N = 52 N = 104 N = 174 X2 ......................... 1.61, NS 0, NS 3.15, NS 0.56, NS NOTE.-X2 based on 1:1 expected. N = total trials. him before an 0 male courts; then that trial will be discarded as a case where only one type of male courted. The residual group of females first courted by R but not mating with R will have the frequency of females preferring R lowered, and thus there will be more matings with 0 males for the trials where both types of male courted. Similarly females preferring 0 males would be discarded by first courtships and matings to 0. If such preferences existed, then courtship experi- ence would not be a factor determining the mating choice. In the four experiments just described in the last section, several trials of one type of male courting were discarded; there were about 30% to 40% of such trials in these experiments. Since R males court more than 0 males, more trials where females might have prefer- ences for R would be eliminated, so that there would be fewer R males mating in trials where both types courted than in trials where only one type courted. Frequencies of trials in which R males mated are grouped by whether only one type or both types of male courted (table 3). There is a slight but never significant decrease in R matings in the trials where both types of male courted. Thus if these females do prefer one type of male, the preference cannot be of much magnitude and any bias that might result does not really change the outcome to any degree. At best the females might have some slight preference for one type of male, but the conditioning effect of courtship overcomes any such preference particularly in the outcrossed experiments. EXPERIMENTS WITH WILD-TYPE Drosophila If females tend to be conditioned against the type of male first to court, it becomes essential to extend observations to wild type in several species to determine how general this tendency may be among Drosophila females. Also a fundamental question arises when we consider a genetically polymorphic popula- tion. Assuming that males differ in their courtship signals, do females detect individual differences and discriminate between any male first to court and one that couts subsequently? Is a female's threshold lowered faster if she is courted by different males or by males that differ in courtship signals? Drosophila silvestris.-With these questions in mind, I visited the laboratory of H. L. Carson at the University of Hawaii to test the Hawaiian species, D.</page><page sequence="11">DO FEMALE FLIES CHOOSE THEIR MATES? 685 silvestris. Tibial bristle variation in males from populations occupying opposite coasts of the island of Hawaii functions in courtship (Carson and Bryant 1979), and the possibility was explored that females could distinguish males that came from separate populations differing in the tibial trait. Carson had not only worked out many techniques for observing matings in this species but he had been successful in breeding strains from populations differing in the tibial trait, so that mating tests could be carried out efficiently over a few months' time. Details of these tests and results are presented in Spiess and Carson (1981), but a brief summary is pertinent to this discussion. In Hawaiian picture-wing species, males display lek behavior, and if two or more males are confined to the same space they quickly become combative towards each other. Our objective was to ascertain female acceptance conditions, so we designed mating tests to give each female and male an alternative choice between two individuals of opposite sex every 30 min. At the start of a test, two males were set into each chamber and allowed an initial period of combat to determine a "winner" and a "loser"; the former were usually used in tests when it was found that the latter hardly achieved any matings. Intrapopulation tests (strains from Kilauea with extra tibial bristles) involved 185 females of which 55.1% mated and were classified into categories according to the readiness of the female to mate and the sequence of courtship. About 30% of the females were low threshold (accepting the first male after less than 4 courtship bouts) while females with higher threshold accepted first and second courting males about equally (25: 36, respectively). Thus if individual differences do exist among males, females did not detect them and were not conditioned to any significant degree. Among interpopulation tests (strains from Kilauea alternating with strains from Kahuku which lack the extra tibial bristles), with 52.1% mating of 186 females tested, females with moderate to high threshold favored the second-to-court male over the first to court particularly when the second male was from the Kilauea strain (extra bristles), by a ratio of 41:15. Thus when a morphological feature (tibial bristles) and population differences did exist among males, females were con- ditioned against the first-to-court male. Drosophila persimilis. -In our laboratory at the University of Illinois, Lyn Guinsatao has tested two strains of D. persimilis that differ in karyotype (KL/KL vs. MD/MD) as well as in locality of origin (KL from the redwoods locality of northern California, the double-cross hybrid tester used by Spiess and Yu [1975]; and MD from McDonald Ranch, Napa Valley, a highly receptive strain used by Yu and Spiess [1978]). Mating tests were similar to those designed by Kruckeberg with a single female and six males, three of each type, with one type marked by poking a hole through one wing. Courtship sequences and matings were deter- mined by observation in shell vials. Pertinent data are given in table 4, sec. A. The KL double-cross hybrid females were more highly receptive (low threshold) than the MD females. It is important to note that the percentage of females mating with the second-to-court male averaged about 80% irrespective of the strain.

He isolated high (H) and low (L) lines after generations of selection. At first he made them available to me for testing H and L females for discrimination of first versus second-to-court males in single female tests with 1 H: 1 L male per test (see results in EBS sample, table 4, sec. B); and he tested the same strains 4 mo later (CW sample, table 4) along with the original parent strains (LS and CS) and a third, wild strain (Or-R), with 50 females per strain, and all single females with 1H: IL males. Results in table 4, sec. B indicate discrimination in favor of second-to-court males, 66.7% for the 60 matings out of 180 from the H- and L-selected strains in which both males courted. The LS strain was repeated with 50 more females with the significant frequency of 74% favoring the second-to-court male while the other two strains (CS and Or-R) are either neutral or slightly favoring the first-to-court male. A control test was done with LS females courted by males from the same strain but with either a hole poked through one wing (o male) or not (+ male). Out of 75 females tested, 33 were courted by both o and + males: 15 mated to the male first to court while 18 (55%) mated to the second. Thus mating appears random and I conclude that LS females cannot detect differences among individual males of their own strain but can detect differences between H and L males. Females in the H- and L-selected lines are likely to be more heterozygous than the original inbred strains even after 17 generations of selection since the regimen involved gene flow between H and L components of the population. Thus the significant excess above 50% choosing the second-to-court male could have a genetic basis similar to that proposed for the repeatability tests of R and 0 eye color mutants described above. Alternatively, the result with the LS strain could imply a genetic factor(s) charac- teristic of that strain, since it was also used in the outcross of the repeatability experiment 4. RARE MALE MATING ADVANTAGE UNOBSERVED The working hypothesis that a female fly discriminates between courting males can now be modified as follows. A receptive female with moderate to high threshold tends to be conditioned by the first courting male so that she will accept a male that differs from the first in some element(s) or feature(s) of his courtship. Thus the rare male advantage ought to be observed when the female is so conditioned. Discrimination as a result of such conditioning is expressed best by heterozygous females, and mutant males court more actively when their genetic background is heterozygous. Either extreme homozygosity in females or lack of differences between males in courtship elements or both would be expected to eliminate the rare male advantage. Markow (1978) took care to isogenize all chromosomes in tests between mutant sepia and wild type (CS) of D. melanogaster. Either sepia and wild type males were identical in courtship or females were not discriminating or both. Isogenicity of all flies probably precluded the demonstration of rare male advantage. In a later experiment (Markow et al. 1980), a slight rare male advantage was detectable when Or-R and CS strains were used. If females were low in discriminatory ability because of their extreme homozygosity and if in addition the two wild-type strains</page><page sequence="14">688 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST of males did not display courtship differences (males were not tested by these authors) negative results might be expected. Their geo-positive and geo-negative strains used had been selected for over 200 generations and were certainly homozygous over much of their genome; in addition there had been no testing of males to indicate their likelihood of differences in courtship. The wild type CS strain females are not entirely undiscriminating however. In other experiments, Markow and her colleagues (Long et al. 1980; Markow et al. 1978) found that virgin males were more successful than males that had mated ("experienced") one hour or less previously in spite of near equality of factors such as time spent before and during courtship, being first to court, and overall mating speed. Also for males of different ages, the older was more successful than the younger. Unfortunately we do not know the order of courtship in these experiments (whether mating success was associated with being second to court or not), so that we do not know whether the males' success results entirely from factors of female discrimination similar to those which we have found. It is apparent that females of an inbred wild strain can discriminate between males that differ in age or in mating experience. The males predominantly chosen were most produc- tive, so that females exercising choice benefited most. Also Markow (1980) dis- covered that her CS strain would demonstrate a rare male mating advantage with males marked with fluorescent dust (pink vs. blue varied in ratios 8:2, 5:5, 2:8) if the minority males were chosen from near the tops of the storage vials. When minority males were chosen from the bottoms of the vials, the two colored forms of males mated according to the input frequencies. In separate tests, males from the tops of storage vials mated nearly three times more frequently than males from the bottoms. Thus males could be distinguished by females when they differed in activity (and possibly geotaxis) because those from the tops of vials moved more than those resting quietly on the food at the bottom of the vial. Until more details of courtship are observed, however, we cannot speculate further on that experi- ment. In other reports of negative rare male effects, trying to account for the lack of effect becomes more perplexing. Van Delden's group (Pot et al. 1980; Knoppien et al. 1980) have demonstrated mating success differences in experiments with strains of D. melanogaster with electrophoretic fast (F) and slow (S) variants of alcohol dehydrogenase, but they were unsuccessful in the demonstration of rare type advantage when they varied both sexes simultaneously in ratios of 5 F: 45 S pairs, 25 F: 25 S pairs, 45 F: 5 S pairs. Since both sexes displayed parallel sexual activity differences (F being more active and successful at warm temperature than S for example), it is likely that if any rare type advantage were to be demonstrable that varying both sexes simultaneously would dilute the effect as I observed with D. pseudoobscura (Spiess 1968). REPEAT MATING Most Drosophila females become unreceptive directly following a mating. Manning (1967) found that inhibition to a second mating has two components inD. melanogaster: (1) an effect from copulation which wears off after 48 h; and (2) an effect of live sperm in the seminal receptacles which gradually diminishes over 8</page><page sequence="15">DO FEMALE FLIES CHOOSE THEIR MATES? 689 to 10 days. Nevertheless repeat mating occurs frequently enough to make us realize that female flies that mate with just one male are probably exceptional, and our expectations for populational change must take remating into consideration. Selection for reducing the time between successive matings has been shown to be effective forD. melanogaster (Pyle and Gromko 1981), with genetic determination of rapid remating predominantly by a relatively small number of recessive factors on the X chromosome. Studies on repeat mating (see Cobbs 1977; Gilbert et al. 1981; Prout and Bundgaard 1977) have focused on the male's fitness values, given that sperm mixing or displacement may occur following the second mating. However repeat mating experiments need to be done with the female's viewpoint in mind. Namely, we need to know whether the conditioning of first courtship has any lasting effect and whether the type of male accepted in the second mating is related in any way to the type accepted in the first. Only a few experiments have been performed to ascertain any effect of prior experience on female choice (Pruzan and Ehrman 1974; Pruzan 1976; O'Hara et al. 1976). Drosophila pseudoobscura females with AR and CH chromosomal arrangements (homokaryotypes) were used in the extensive experiments of Pru- zan. Initial mating experience of 4-day-old virgin females was given by mating with males in the following combinations: AR x AR, CH x CH (homogamic matings) and AR females x orange-eyed (ST) males, CH females x orange-eyed (ST) males. Females that produced fertile eggs were aged until 11 days old and then were tested for repeat mating in observation chambers where 20 females were given a choice of 20 males (AR females were paired with AR + orange-eyed males while CH females were paired with CH + orange-eyed males). Alternative types of males occurred either in a ratio of 1: 4, 1: 1, or 4: 1. In comparison with similarly aged virgin controls, Pruzan found females that mated a second time tended to remate with the same type of male with which they had originally copulated at 4 days of age. If these results are taken at face value, it would appear that male types accepted at first mating tend to be chosen in repeat matings. Unfortunately the original matings at 4 days of age were forced, in that females had no choice except to mate or not to mate. No opportunity was given for conditioning of first-male-to-court experience such as we find tends to occur when the rare male advantage is demonstrated. Consequently, we have no way of telling from these experiments whether a female's choice once made would hold (whether the conditioning would be effective) or not. We can only conclude that both age and experience affect the female's choice of mate, but we must await critical experiments to find out the consequences of repeat mating for selection of male genotypes. DARWINIAN FITNESS AND MATE CHOICE If female flies exercise discrimination in mate choice, what fitness value does such discriminatory ability have? Second, if the discrimination is exercised fol- lowing a conditioning against the first type of male to court, what benefit to the female might ensue from her waiting? Third, if discrimination and/or conditioning are best expressed by females that are highly heterozygous compared with more</page><page sequence="16">690 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST homozygous random mating females, what might be the consequences expected for the population? Based on some experimental evidence, we can discuss how discrimination in mate choice may function as a fitness character; for example, how might exercise of discriminatory ability improve the fitness of progeny? Partridge (1980) de- scribed experiments with a wild-type outbred stock of D. melanogaster kept in a large laboratory population from which females were either allowed to choose their mates or given no choice but to mate (or not mate) with single males chosen by the investigator. Fitness was measured in terms of competitive ability of progeny larvae. In the first experiment, 100 virgin females mated within the population cage were presumed to have done so by choice while another 100 were mated to males in single pairs (no choice). In a second experiment, 100 virgin females emerging in the population cage were allowed to choose mates from 300 males while a second 100 females were mated individually as before. All females after mating were separated into batches of 10 and allowed to lay eggs for one day at a time; first instar larvae were collected in batches of 200 from the "choice" and "no choice" females separately, planted on food in vials along with 200 mutant sparkling larvae for competitors (400 larvae per vial), and the proportion of wild-type flies emerging measured competitive ability of larvae and pupae. In all cases a slightly higher proportion of wild type emerged from vials parented by the " choice" females, but the differences were small (1%-2.2%) though significant (by virtue of low variance between vials within treatments). Thus exercise of mate choice demonstrated an increase in fitness (competitive ability in progeny). Compare this experiment with Markow's (Long et al. 1980; Markow et al. 1978) in which the males predominantly chosen were most productive. This kind of experiment only whets the appetite for more testing to discover how mate choice may influence reproductive capacity (fitness). Partridge's ex- periment, though stimulating, leaves many questions unanswered. With some knowledge of individual female's discriminating ability, we would be able to discern more exactly what the fitness value of that ability might be. What benefit to the female might ensue from her conditioning against the first courtship experi- ence (signals from the first male to court)? Obviously she must first distinguish her own species. For males of her own species, the first to court are likely to possess reproductive traits and signals near the average for the population. A female that samples potential mates has an opportunity to make a better than average choice. Of course theoretical considerations (Maynard Smith 1978) tell us that in a popu- lation at genetic equilibrium any genetic variation that improves fitness will not be increased in frequency (zero heritability); that is, if a female mates with a fitter than average male, her offspring will not be fitter. However, if a population is not at equilibrium, the situation may be different. Also even if it is at equilibrium, it may be necessary for maintenance of the equilibrium to keep a measurable number of matings between individuals of higher than average fitness. If heterozygosity should prove to be generally associated with discriminatory ability in flies, we may expect a balance between randomly mating homozygotes, perhaps in low density populations following inbreeding (a founder event or a low point in a flush-crash cycle), and discriminatory matings as a population reaches optimum</page><page sequence="17">DO FEMALE FLIES CHOOSE THEIR MATES? 691 density for the species. Group selection between such contrasting populations might ensue. Finally, in stages of evolution that we might expect for development of ethological isolation, it seems logical that an early stage must first include genetic variation controlling discriminatory ability, followed later by fixed preferences in mating; that is, establishment of stimulus signals of a highly specific fine tuning between potential mates and their nervous system cognition and response to those signals. Ultimately assortative mating (mates choosing their own type) must be established as a mate recognition system for efficiency of species reproduction. These steps in the evolution of such systems might well be rapid and require few genetic steps. A fairly constant and unerring choice of mates would characterize the last step so that mixing of populational genomes would be lessened or pre- vented. In summary, we would like to find out whether discriminatory mating behavior leads to improvement in the efficiency of reproduction, that is, greater numbers of progeny or fitter progeny than nondiscriminatory mating. My current plea is fourfold. First, carefully define discriminatory mating behavior. Second, ascertain the dimensions (limits) of this behavior as a recognizable trait. Third, determine its genetic basis so that we may work more intelligently toward the fourth objective, namely, the study of how mating recognition and ethological isolation might evolve.
