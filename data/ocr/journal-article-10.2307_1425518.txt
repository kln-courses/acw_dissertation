<plain_text><page sequence="1">Popular Construction: Handbooks for Home Fronts ANNETTE FIERRO, University of Pennsylvania Product selection and technical coordination-practices encountered in the architecture profession in the United States-are a domain of technological thinking yet to be conceptualized and incorporated in the design process. Examined through issues of housing, the ordinary product, as sold in contemporary construction warehouses, is investigated for a variety of implications, from allowing inhabitants to interact with their own surroundings to incorporation into methods of standardized, economically viable construction. As a methodology of study, collage, montage, and assemblage are examined, both for ideological content related to the use of the ordinary product (from such sources as dadaist collage) and for coincidences that techniques of production share with methods of construction. DESPITE THE RECENT STRUCTURAL OVERTURES OF VARIOUS ENGINEERS abroad, most notably Peter Rice/RFR Engineers and the wave of British architects characterized as the new "high-tech," it has become increasingly apparent in architectural practice in the United States that technological endeavors in the present economic sphere have changed significantly in the past three decades away from an idealized venture initiated within the principles of engineering. Truly technological production has been located, not in architectural practice or the academy, but within the confines of industry, where the development of products and constructional systems has mandated research facilities available to only the most specialized of industries. The explosion in this country of a variety of systems, materials, and individual products has occurred without the intervention of either architects or builders, whose sphere of influence has been defined by the demands of the market and not active participation in the design of the products and systems themselves. The term custom-designed now indicates, not design produced by the architect, but the architect's accomplished navigation through systems largely defined by the industry; architects' "customization" is typically limited to the parameters established by manufacturers. The limited direct influence of architects is in the field of industrial consultants, most of whom were educated in typical architecture curriculums, now practice in fields of research, marketing, and sales and are only tangentially involved with the traditional office practice. This trend might indicate the demise of the golden age of structural exploration and material invention in architectural pro- duction. Nevertheless, the current specialization of various indus- tries and products shows few signs of abating; economic structures continue, if anything, to erode further the potential of architects to journal ofArchitectural Education, pp. 16-22 ? 1997 ACSA, Inc. become actively involved in the products and systems they specify. The economics of the typical American practice makes it unfeasible to support research and development within budgets barely able to sustain the briefest of design-development stages. Indeed, for con- temporary architectural practice, knowledge of products produced elsewhere and the coordination of their usage have perhaps become the central arena of what might be renamed technical expertise. The imperative nature of this knowledge increasingly raises questions about conventional technological pedagogy within the academy, as do changes in the architect's professional responsibilities. The typi- cal structures course motivated toward the sizing of members through various types of calculations, for example, has perhaps been rendered obsolete; few if any architects will be allowed by liability standards to take final responsibility for such activity. A strong case might be made (elsewhere) for shifting emphasis from productive exercise-that which might be used to determine final specifica- tions-to conceptual knowledge perhaps more suitable for the broader comprehension necessary to mediate between the expertise of more thoroughly trained consultants. In addition, introducing architecture students to critically important aspects of coordina- tion-for example, between the different technical consultants and among the bewildering array of products available for use-is absent in most curricula, yet as a single component, certainly in terms of expenditure of time, it dominates contemporary American practice. I want neither to propose a return to a previous operational mode nor to instigate particularized training within the academy that is necessarily distant from the needs of the industry itself. Instead, I want to argue for making the upheaval in the construction industry and marketplace part of the conceptual underpinning of the design project itself, especially in the speculative realm of the academy, as the nuances of the assembled object (a conglomeration of mass-produced pieces) are held up against the presumably wholly crafted artifact (a singular event of particular material making). Equally important is simulating a mode of production that is a continuous process of mediation, of substitutions of pieces and parts, a constant compromise and fluctuation in the constitution of the finished piece. These are certainly not new issues; the call to examine the consequences of mass production dates to early modernists in the Bauhaus and even to such figures as Frank Lloyd Wright.' It is curious, however, that little current speculation addresses the effects of this radical change in contemporary construction, not only on the nature of practice but on the consequences for the finished product, a reconstitution of mass- produced pieces struggling for resonance within a world already comprised of the mass-produced. Still intact in most architecture September 1997 JAE 51/1 1 6</page><page sequence="2">schools is the reification of a shop experience that enshrines the crafted object as the idealized form of production, however unattain- able in today's construction. Too often, theories of technology fo- cus entirely on mystically oriented practices of making, presuming that the architect still acts with a religious power to create raw ma- teriality. Yet a more accurate description of the architects' current charge lies in the nuanced confluence of the negotiator and bricoleur: an arbiter ever sensitive to the consequences of various decisions among consultants and product catalogs. These questions become particularly relevant to the evolution of the warehouse construction marketplace, particularly Home Depot, whose strategy of undercutting prices offered even to the trade-contractors and architects-has essentially begun to redefine a material sensibility for a range of different building types, from mass-produced housing to small commercial buildings. It is likely that this influence will be extended to higher budget projects as Home Depot's enormous buying potential redefines, through demand structure, the range of products that will be available for any type of use. There are a number of potential implications of this transformation for the American home. In The Practice ofEveryday Life, Michel de Certeau outlined possibilities of the dominated to navigate subversively through imposed structures: "The actual order of things is precisely what 'popular' tactics turn to their own ends, without any illusion that it will change any time soon. Though elsewhere it is exploited by any dominant power or supply denied by an ideological discourse, here order is tricked by an art."2 In a richly developed argument outlining the potential of enunciating practices previously kept furtive, de Certeau maintains that tactics exist in spaces of everyday life that act in a celebratory way to invert and undermine authoritarian systems-strategies-in infinitely mobile ways, impossible to anticipate. The paths that these tactics inhabit are termed trajectories, barely perceptible fluctuations in ordering systems that the ultimate operants-in de Certeau's argument constituted by the oppressed-have had little say in defining. It is under the guise of an uncannily similar sentiment that Home Depot's services have proliferated, especially for American residential building. By contrast with other home-center retailers who offer similarly discounted products to the do-it-yourselfer- Hechingers, Builders Square, Mr. HOW, Payless Cashway-Home Depot operates on a principle that emphasizes not only the purchase of items, but includes education on self-installation procedures, sales staff trained as consultants to consumers, and weekly public seminars on various topics. This unabashed agenda of self-empowerment has provided the American consumer with the ability to eliminate the hated middleman, be it the contractor or the laborer, as enthusiasts spend weekends in seminars on topics as var- ied as electrical rewiring to the correct laying of ceramic tiles: "And they are just plain fed up with lousy service. They are tired of con- tractors who pad their bills, of repairmen who don't show up when they're supposed to, and of house painters who trample their bushes and stain their carpets."3 And there is the perceived redundancy of the architect, who is seen as adding much to a budget more plea- surably spent on the materials themselves. Yet inherent in these gi- ant warehouses, normally located on urban peripheries in close proximity to their suburban market, lies the opportunity for the individual consumer to operate as outlined by de Certeau's utopian vision: Not only do these empowered consumers have the ability to resist the conventional structure and economics of the design and construction trade, but the knowledge imparted also gives them the power to reinvent uses for the products provided by Home Depot in ways not originally conceived by the manufacturer or supplier. In addition, Home Depot offers an opportunity (little advertised to its constituents) to custom-order products not normally stocked and displayed. The conflation of de Certeau's prediction of an (un)organized revolt with a "space of its own"-albeit here founded in an affluent middle class rather than an oppressed minority-and the traditional American emphasis on individual self-reliance has proved a tremen- dous success. Between 1979 and 1986, when most "do-it-yourself" centers were growing at a rate of 11.6 percent, Home Depot excelled at 82 percent, since then expanding from a Southern/Central United States market into a national chain with a significant command of the market. Between 1981, when Home Depot went public, to 1988, its share price increased 6,300 percent.4 These staggering figures, however, do not reflect the full influence of Home Depot, which might include the amount of labor, as well as the nonexpended design time, wholly appropriated by consumers. This market share remains completely unquanti- fiable, silent and inaccessible to predatory interests, from architectural marketing strategies to federal and local taxes. It is ironic to reiterate the writings of de Certeau in this exaggeratedly capitalist venture (de Certeau's constituents were again the truly disadvantaged and not merely the disgruntled), yet pieces of his writing are pertinent: "What is being counted is what is used, not the ways of using it. Paradoxically, the latter become invisible in the universe of codification and generalized transparency. Only the effects (the quantity and locus of the consumed products) of these waves that flow in everywhere remain perceptible."' The movement of inventory off the high shelves of Home Depot serves as the phan- 1 7 Fierro</page><page sequence="3">tom trace of an underswelling of design and construction enter- prises carried out largely without the sanction or critical interven- tion of official disciplines or agencies. The role of the architect seems to be verging on obsolescence, and perhaps this is indeed the case; the truly vernacular dwelling is after all by definition one in which the architect has never been involved (although the participation of higher income groups certainly does extract a portion of the market from architects). The central question here, however, is not intended to position the architect in such ventures, but rather to examine how to incorporate these issues in design, particularly in the studio, and to evaluate the possibility of a real extension into a world of practice that operates just outside the parameters of the vernacular home: in small commercial projects, but especially in multifamily dwellings. Here, the effects of coordination and new market structures join with the implications of the acts and practices of individuals, reinvigorating questions posed many times over, from Le Corbusier's housing project at Pessac to Nicholas Habraken's later theories of modifiable infrastructures, in the potential of the individual to intervene in the physical configuration of her dwelling. Yet before redefining such infrastructures (or determining that infrastructures are indeed called for), several issues must be addressed. In the realm of ordinary construction, the first obstacles to remove (within the sanctioned architectural community) are existing biases against both the aesthetic appeal of products available to large audiences and the weightier connotation that such a product has in a consumer society. I hope that it is unnecessary to argue the aesthetic merits of one material over another outside of technical or functionalist issues-that is, properties of the material used to construct a product or the degree of functionality that one material holds over another in particular applications. A disposition in favor of certain materials based on purely aesthetic attributes must admit its dependence on a cultural frame both multivalent and continuously fluctuating. Examples that seem particularly noteworthy have to do with the use of products manufactured out of artificially produced material, especially plastics or paints, which many architects have long held in disdain. It is especially in this current era of a wide diversification of new materials that such resistance seems outmoded and bound up with values based on a tradition of handmade craft. I do not mean to infer, however, that associational or conno- tative qualities of materials are irrelevant; actually, my intentions are quite the contrary. I want to search for techniques to raise the stature of the ordinary: ordinary demands of life and ordinary products as- sociated with that life. The briefest survey of this topic leads imme- diately to contemporary art. Architecture falls far behind not only in using the commonplace, but also in recognizing the content-laden significance both of the ordinary and of the consumerist product. As early as the twenties, the dadaist movement advocated a conscious choice to identify with common materials, a practice that originated in the synthetic cubist collages of Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso but that dadaists imbued with a pointedly ideological slant. Based on the belief that the inclusion of ordinary materials would serve to reno- vate art, the use of ordinary materials was intended to signal a retreat from associations of precious materials favored by the upper classes. Common materials were seen to embody the principles of open pro- test, especially in Berlin, where efforts by the dadaists were as much in the form of written political material as they were visual photo- montages; the paradigm of the dadaist ready-made was centered around the idea of individual creation as a trap of the bourgeoisie. Later developments, particularly in the work of Marcel Duchamp, who flatly rejected the unique art object in favor of elements from the "real world," continued to challenge the world of everyday objects for their inherent content and associative potential to connect to lived life. His work spawned generations of influential contemporary art- ists, from Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns to John Cage. This particular movement spectacularly culminated with images of com- mercial products made into cultural icons by Andy Warhol, whose caustic commentary nonetheless had a certain amount of reverence for the persona and product that had managed to attain cult status.' Warhol not only reinvented the significance of the popular product within the elevated circle of fine art, but intrinsically changed the self- awareness of popular culture to its own artifacts.' A contemporany of the dadaists, the Viennese architect Adolf Loos, wrote, "Any utilitarian object whatsoever will tell us about the customs and character of a people."' Loos declared that the conse- quence of redesigning the ordinary might be seen at best as a cultural redundancy, at worst an oxymoron: To redesign those objects that already carried essential cultural meaning served to negate their in- trinsic value as cultural signifiers. Loos asserted that contemporary construction was equally a component of semiotic significance and should not be tampered with, as it inherently contained seeds of con- tent. Of the roofer, Loos wrote, "He makes the roof. What kind of roof? A pretty roof or an ugly roof? He doesn't know. The roof."8 These same sentiments might be easily attributed to de Certeau who wrote, after Ludwig Wittgenstein, that expressibility was limited to the domain of ordinary language (everyday life) and mentioned spe- cifically the call of Adolf Loos for a functional austerity. It is essen- tial to note, however, that by contrast with Loos's written adherence September 1997 JAE 51/1 1 8</page><page sequence="4">to existing culture through modes of construction, his design work did not preclude overt manipulation in the larger organization of the elements of the basic constructional language to produce effects that were deliberately disquieting to contemporary Viennese society. Stripping the exteriors of his constructions to the facts of their own making indeed provoked outrage over the silent anthropomorphic mask placed aggressively on the urban street. So while conventional construction might be adhered to quite consistently, the end to which this language-"the silence of technique"-was used in Loos's work was not based on the advocacy of polite coherency but rather on a markedly dadaist effort to disturb through the inclusion of the displaced familiar.' Examined in a contemporary setting, the ma- nipulation of the stature of the ordinary through overt exploitation of the vernacular is exhibited in the work of Frank Gehry, particu- larly the early works-the Familian House project of 1978, the Spiller House in Venice of 1980, and his own house of 1978-which commented on the ad hocism of the ubiquitous Californian stud wall and chain-link fence construction, a recontextualization (within its original setting) of vernacular construction. A similar exploration appears as recently as the reinvented Parisian limestone wall in the American Center of 1993. Despite the emphatic sculptural empha- sis of the work and Gehry's own notorious aversion to articulating a critical position, his long and celebrated association with the artist Claes Oldenburg illustrates a telling continuity from the dadaists to the latter stages of pop art to which Oldenburg belongs. There is inherent in this proposal, however, a flawed contradic- tion against which de Certeau issues clear warnings: "Truly 'popular culture' will always resist established order .... [It] is not a corpus considered as foreign, fragmented in order to be displayed, studied, and quoted by a system which does to objects what it does to living beings."'o Techniques of referential estrangement infer necessarily an exterior position from which that reference is observed: Dadaist art relies on the familiarity of the bourgeoisie with historic notions of art in order to supplant these with revolutionary measures. In issues of housing, this position of exteriority contradicts the stated premise of incorporating the actions and desires of the occupants themselves, a system of meaning necessarily constructed internally. A position of exteriority proposes a seemingly insurmountable obstacle to that of a situation through which individuals-the consumers of Home De- pot, the inhabitants of a hypothetical housing project-produce, through the making of their surroundings, discourses of their own. This particular dilemma seems unresolvable and even more problem- atic when extended to its natural conclusion: Does housing, by defi- nition, elude the possibility of an intellectual conception? It is important to follow the implications of the popular product a bit fur- ther. First, it is impossible to escape referent systems in general, at- tested to in the realm of popular culture by the enduring popularity of brand names, be it Nike shoes or Speakman facets, above and beyond quality and equitable pricing. More important, however, is the vulnerability of even these externally imposed meanings (according to de Certeau) to be subjugated by users who act continuously to appropriate, no matter what structure is imposed. Thus, equally important in the example of the Nike label is the story of the reinvention of its signification: In certain urban territories, for example, Nike shoes tossed over electrical wires establish gang meeting spots. However deliberate the attempt to inscribe legible systems of singular meaning in the use of structures and products and materials, inhabitants will often take these over and re-create them for their own purposes. As seen in the most recent appropriation in the contemporary art of the eighties (Jeff Koons, among others), works are placed directly within and sometimes hardly distinguishable from a popular context: Mechanisms of art, as privileged experience transforming society from the vantage point of the museum, are seen to break down into states of simulacrum (Jean Baudrillard). A circuit of exchange between contradictory signs is eventually uninterrupted: signs ultimately cancel each other out. Understood in this manner, it is perhaps only within the realm of a popular architecture that a blurring of boundaries between an art examining "lived life" and the rest of production is finally achieved, as perceived use coincides with actual use." To raise the stature of the ordinary, several key ideas might still be gleaned from an examination of dadaist techniques, from collage to montage and their three-dimensional extension into the art of assemblage. There is nothing inherently subversive about the collage/montage process: Montage does not reproduce the real, but constructs an object (its lexical field includes the term 'assemble, build, join, unite, add, combine, link, construct, organize') or rather mounts a process ('the relation of form to content is no longer a relation of exteriority, the form resembling clothes which can dress no matter what content, it is process, genesis, result of a work') in order to intervene on the world, not to reflect but to change real- ity."12 As the similarity in constructional terminology suggests, the analogy of collage to a building process dependent on pieces im- ported from other sources-pieces and parts bought in the ware- house or from a catalog and applied to a base construction-shares the aspect of a particularized disjunction, an assemblage and reassemblage into a diverse unity of fragmented parts. Both pro- cesses are equally marked by factors of choice and substitution at all points of their production; continuous substitution constitutes a fluidity of process that is the primary characteristic of the technique 1 9 Fierro</page><page sequence="5">of production. Finally and perhaps most important, the principal character of collage and assemblage is their complexity. The asso- ciations set forth by the inclusion of the ordinary are never singu- lar-the multiplicity and temporality of possible interpretations are exactly the essential character of such work: "Its [collage's] hetero- geneity, even if it is reduced by every operation of composition, imposes itself on the reading as stimulation which could be neither univocal nor stable."'13 Techniques (Some, of Many) In the assemblages of Joseph Cornell, the multiplicity of associa- tions discussed above arises in the permutations found in combina- tions of the unknown (and often esoteric), placed immediately adjacent to the commonplace. This simple technique, recognizing the effect of juxtaposition, offers a number of possibilities for do- mestic architecture, particularly in the use of premanufactured pieces intended for overt personalization-shelving, windowboxes, storage systems, even large-mullioned windows-placed to allow for a simple discrepancy between these anonymous systems of con- tainment and objects of personal significance. This idea might also incorporate a conscious use of display as personal items are chosen (by the inhabitant) to be revealed consciously, presumably to a larger public sphere. The anonymity of the display systems chosen crystallizes the contrast of the personal nature of the items to be displayed versus an exquisitely crafted set of mahogany shelves, for example. A similar use of juxtaposition is exemplified in the work of Jasper Johns or Robert Rauschenberg (e.g., Johns's Painted Bronze, 1960, or Rauschenberg's Canyon, 1959), where contrast is provided between literally incorporated objects-found objects- and constructed forms; the disparity between these two binary ele- ments recalls Le Corbusier's use of standard plumbing fixtures set adjacent to flowing surfaces in the entry and bathrooms of Villa Savoye.14 The first of these techniques-juxtaposing the common- place against the unknown-suggests possibilities in the design of primary systems: ordinary base construction (stud walls, masonry bearing structures, plasterboard) manipulated to bring forth the nature of its own construction simultaneously contrasted by impo- sitions by inhabitants, comprised of secondary systems-accesso- ries, window treatments, shelving systems, or simply the provision of empty nooks and crannies-to be accommodated (and perhaps marked) in the primary system. The latter of the two techniques, using literally incorporated objects, suggests a careful analysis of the character of the ordinary pieces proposed and a distinction to be drawn (or a particular form of sympathy) to the character of the adjacent constructional surround. Both of these techniques, in accommodating both the ordinary product with a more standard- ized form of construction, also raise the possibility of an infrastructural treatment, allowing discrete systems to coexist suc- cessfully but operate independently. This new possibility of infra- structure, however, is not derived by an order of comprehensive, immutable rules, but rather comprises fluctuating conditions ac- commodating multiple occasions of use (or misuse). In addition, both of these techniques also depend on localized methods of con- struction, particularly on details at points of connection or adja- cency of disparate elements: Traditional notions of craft might be reengaged here as particular degrees of conjunction or disjunction are implied by the composition of the mediating joint. Aspects of performance as well as implications of "environ- mental tableaux" (such as in the art of Jim Dine, Claes Oldenburg, and Ed and Nancy Kienholz) raise latent theatrical possibilities found in discernible architectural "settees." The prefabricated kitchen element, for example, placed particularly in space might choreograph elements of movement or spatial sequences around the actions of the inhabitants, participants, and spectators in scenarios of unstaged acts of daily living. Doors and windows might provide series of unexpected, atypical openings and closings between spaces and carry the same potential, as do accessorized pieces more eccentrically located: operable mirrors, movable partitions." An argument for the recognizability of the premanufactured "set- piece"-the element detailed elsewhere to connote home-is exactly that supported by the nuances of Duchamp's ready-made, again providing reference to the acts that are assumed to be part and parcel of daily life but vacillate in inferring the stability and instability of the original location of home. In more conceptual work, systems of chance (as in Yves Klein's interpretation of Jean Arp) might be particularly productive in forming definitive strategies-games-for the incorporation of the continuous contingencies of typical construction, from the substitutions provoked by product availabilities to the vacillations of client desires. All of this work is characterized by a sense of coherency not typically or easily understood, composed of a dissemination of bor- rowed pieces within ruptured settings, thereby indicating the ulti- mate struggle of the method of production. In housing, this characteristic of tenuous finality is compounded: For economic rea- sons, systems must be repeated, undermining the defining particu- larity of the new recontextualization. Yet the effect of estrangement that repetition in itself carries out suggests another possible tech- nique for giving new status to the ordinary: By repeating an ordi- September 1997 JAE 51/1 20</page><page sequence="6">nary screen door a number of times, the presence of the screen door is made evident. The necessity of repetition also offers other defi- nite advantages, primarily that of imbuing a number of discrete pieces with the legibility of a collective whole, a collection of pieces, but also a community of individuals. This play in levels of collec- tivity offers a wide range of possible mediations and characteristics. The permutations of screening elements in Renzo Piano's fiberglass concrete curtain wall in his recent housing project in Paris, for ex- ample, generate a play between the personal objects of the inhabit- ants placed just behind that screen and layers of complexly systemized construction. These techniques borrowed from contemporary art propose a number of different alterations to a thinking that is termed technological. Here, it is not the efficiency or efficacy of the system or material that governs the design of systems and material usage, but rather a more holistic incorporation of the implication of a variety of factors, from evident market structures to desires of clients to the real demands experienced in the design and subsequent construction of built work. And although architects are encouraged to reinvigorate the call of traditional modernists for emphasis on collective housing, there is a latent warning of consistently rationalized "systems"; infrastructures might most often be generated on contingent circumstance, from the perceived quality of the ordinary object to the imagined events of typical life: expressions of the individual occupants themselves. The vision of housing sought in this article incorporates both the open-ended association of products and materials as well as an opening for inhabitants to determine the final qualities of their dwelling. The particular structures examined constitute a vision of a reaestheticized domain, incompletely composed of fragments of recognized parts and pieces, to be joined and manipulated finally by the occupants, their acts and belongings, the events of their lives. And though this vision for housing requires the architect to relinquish control before the final "finishing," the role of the architect might never be so necessary (and difficult) in establishing parameters for constructions that might lead to unanticipated ap- propriations by the inhabitants themselves. The phenomenal success of Home Depot provides substantial evidence of these repressed urges to personalize and to instill personal creativity. This need to admit creative process and differentiate the space and material of the home-especially the interior-seems strong enough to confront the heterogeneity implied by the threat of diminished resale values, the specter posed as a central motivation behind American adherence to convention. As Home Depot's suc- cess suggests, the location of these urges within groups of the most seemingly conventionally oriented homeowners-those of the middle and upper-middle classes-provides ample confirmation of a large undercurrent of dissatisfaction, across boundaries of economic status, with normative constructional products and practices. It is within the realm of truly marginalized cultures, however, that approaches advocated in this article present the most resonant opportunities to address not only the space and material of the inte- rior, but also the exterior structure and outlying spaces of the street. As Margaret Crawford has noted with regard to Latino households in East Los Angeles, there is a wealth of observable experimentation in the housing of subcultures that have been resistant to market con- formity, exactly in coincidence with issues cited here. Spatial struc- tures and forms of construction that admit intervention allow these groups privileges far beyond providing a sense of self-determined aestheticization: "In its decommodified form, the house becomes a vehicle for mobilizing social identity, making a purely legible state- ment that provides residents with a new sense of agency. Thus rede- fining the political field to include issues clustered around the home, daily life, and urban residential space offers the residents of East L.A., massively underrepresented in official political channels, new venues for collective activity."" It is this series of implications and opportu- nities, of urban and political nature, incorporating the facets and rituals of ordinary life as they are expressed through ordinary ele- ments and constructions, that finally offers hope for extending the agendas of the original social utopians. Within this realm, architects might fully engage a range of possibilities given a commitment to cutting cost-another imperative coincidence between "ordinary construction" and the very real impositions of economic viability. These agendas, however, must never again be mistranslated into fi- nite structures; by definition they must be left as definitively unfin- ished-an ambition that might finally result in the dadaist "sublation of art into the praxis of life," otherwise coined aptly in an inversion of the famous remark by Andy Kaprow directed at the sixties "hap- penings"-here it is not the potential of art to seem closer to life, but an opportunity for life to approach that of art.

Loos's famous dictum relegating the artistic component in architectural production strictly to the domains of either the "tomb or the monument" is nevertheless contradicted by the effect of "shock" (the paradigmatic technique of the dadaists) as a means of "shattering" bourgeois reception through the imposition of forms of technological development. See Peter Burger's discussion in "The Avant- garde as the Self-criticism of Art in Bourgeois Society," in The Theory oftheAvant- Garde (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1992). Although Loos's use of construction differs fundamentally from the dadaists' inclusion of the ordinary in their collages to disturb the reception of the work of art in the museum (and thus the institution of art in bourgeois society), the working hypothesis here of shared interests between Loos and the Dadaists relies on this mutual technique: disturbance to normative fabric as a revelation/implosion of bourgeois suppositions. 10. de Certeau, Practice ofEveryday Life, p. 26. 11. The issues of this study are very closely shared with those of Ben Nicholson in Appliance House (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1990), yet the implications of setting work within economically viable construction-with a curtailed range of formal speculation-is supported by an ambiguous reading within a "popular" (vernacular) realm. 12.
