<plain_text><page sequence="1">Levinas and the Project of Jewish Philosophy* Shmuel Trigano In "violence and metaphysics"1, Jacques Derrida undertakes to under- stand and to weigh the import of the thought of Emmanuel Levinas by resituating it within the perspective of Western philosophy as the latter defines itself in relation to its Greek origins. But, while the Jewish di- mension of this thought is well underscored in Derrida's essay, the cri- terion for this Judaic element remains undetermined, despite the fact that Derrida delineates its boundaries: "It is neither a Jewish theology, nor a Jewish mysticism (it could even be understood as the challenge to theology and mysticism). Nor is it a dogmatism or a religion, or even a moral philosophy. In the last analysis, it never derives its authority from Hebraic theses or Hebraic texts"2. Derrida, in fact, comes to define Levinassian thought as "the explanation and reciprocal overflowing of two origins and of two historical speeches, Hebraism and Hellenism. Does not a new momentum, a certain strange communality, announce itself in Levinas' thought, which would not be the spiraled return of Alexandrian promiscuity?"3. Our query will continue that of Derrida but we will pursue our investigation not from the starting point of the Graeco-European philosophical heritage but, symmetrically, from the starting point of Hebraism and, more specifically from the starting point of that "Alexandrian promiscuity" to which Derrida refers and that we, * Translated by Prof. Annette Aronowicz (Franklin &amp; Marshall College). 1 In Jacques Derrida, L'écriture et la différence.

What is the status of Hebraism in Levinas's thought and in what way does this thought go beyond it, perhaps inaugurating something other than "Jew- ish philosophy"? Until now, the analysis of Levinas' connection to the universe of Jew- ish thought seems always to have started with the assumption - implicit and never unpacked - that there is a massive intellectual base, identified as "Judaism" (Derrida distinguishes "Hebraism" from "Judaism", be- cause no doubt, he views the latter as a religion). Into this "Judaism", analysts have, without differentiating among them, mixed elements and sequences drawn from a Jewish tradition that nonetheless witnessed di- verse periods and diverse intellectual enterprises (When speaking of Jew- ish tradition I am not only speaking of a Hebraic one. I am referring especially to the Talmud, written in Aramaic, and to rabbinic thought, often not expressed in Hebrew either). Indeed Talmudic thought is not Kabbalistic thought, which is not the thought of "Jewish philosophy", which is not the ethical thought of "Judaism", even if it is true that a structural matrix common to all these modes of Jewish thinking could be made to appear. It is within the framework of this temporal and literary succession of phenomena that we thus find "Alexandrian pro- miscuity", "Jewish philosophy". Before evoking Levinas' link to any of these intellectual corpuses, one must see him against the background of this "Jewish philosophy". This will help us understand both his "He- braic debt" and how his work "goes beyond Hebraism", as Jacques Derrida proclaims. It is, in fact, the link of Levinas' thought to Jewish philosophy that should be probed, more than its apparent kinship to Talmud. For the effort to "translate" Judaism4 into a (Greek) philosophical language, or to think the message of Sinai in Greek categories, or to bring about a synthesis of Greece and Israel, or to philosophize within a Jewish in- spiration and thus necessarily, in all these cases, to "go beyond" Hebra- ism5 is twenty centuries old. "Jewish philosophy", in any case, is not necessarily far removed from the Talmud. Saadya Gaon, one of its main figures, was the chief of the Talmudic Academy in Babylon. This school (Jewish philosophy) of thought was born, in fact, at the same 4 It is at that moment that "Judaism" begins to designate the entire (and plural) fabric of the civilisation of the Jews, still fundamentally marked by the religious. The term ioudaïsmos appears for the first time in Hellenistic Greek, as a concept opposed to that of hellenismos. 5 We have here as many possible definitions of the specificity of "Jewish philosophy" relative to other Judaic corpuses.</page><page sequence="3">(2001) Levinas and the Project of Jewish Philosophy 281 time as the Pharisianism which would produce the Talmud and later rabbinic Judaism... Its founder is Philo of Alexandria (-20/40) who, relying on the recent Greek translation of the Bible, the Septuagint, undertook to read the Bible in terms of philosophical language and thought, inaugurating a unique experience of communication between different intellectual and cultural universes. It could be said that it is from this communication that the West was born, through Christianity. But the communication continued beyond Christianity, giving rise, to cite only the greatest names, to Saadya Gaon (882-942), Maimonides (1135-1204), Mendelssohn (1729-1786), Hermann Cohen (1842-1918) or Rosenzweig (1886-1929) ... The project of Jewish philosophy The project of this school of thought is astonishing: it purports to in- scribe Jewishness ("judeïté") right within the center of something else (Greece at its philosophical center). It purports to leave the bailiwick of its identity to make itself understood, in its very depths, in Greece. In this respect, one must beware of the first impression such an enter- prise might make. Despite the stated intention of "Jewish philosophers" to defend and illustrate the ideas of Judaism, their intellectual experi- ence was of a thought in exile, in exodus from itself, taking up residence in a mental universe foreign to it. This thought was foreign to others and became foreign to itself, since it approached itself in the language of others. It is an adventure with a double meaning which begins here, taking a direction different from that of the nascent Talmudic school which also reads and studies the (Hebraic) text in another language (Aramaic) but without resorting to the "concept". To ground this bold equivalence between the Torah and the logos, the Jewish-philosopher (I use the adjective not as an ethnic identity-marker6 6 If we are to understand "Jewish" in "Jewish philosophy" as referring not to Jewish identity but to a universe of thought and culture, the equation of Jewish philosophy with a language is, on the other hand, more problematic. We cannot, in fact, speak of "Hebraic philosophy" since no text of "Jewish philosophy" was written in Hebrew (rather, in succession, in Greek, Arabic, German and in French). However we can conceive of the Hebrew language as the chief problem of "Jewish philosophy" since it was possible to think it through only with some distance: in a "foreign" language (but "foreign" in relation to what, if the eponymous founder of Judaism is Abraham, the Aramean, or Moses, the Egyptian? ). Indeed, it is the centrality of the Mosaic book for the "Jewish philosopher" which puts Hebrew at the center of his investigation and inscribes it in the depth of all the languages of "Jewish philosophy", hidden in these</page><page sequence="4">282 Shmuel Trigano JSQ 8 but in order to designate a school of thought) is systematically con- fronted by a series of questions whose interweaving constitutes the "ori- ginal stage set" of the Jewish philosopher. He is thus inevitably led to ask the question of origins (in theological terms, of "creation") in a way that contrasts sharply with the initium of the philosopher. In asking the question of being, the Greek philosopher is led to erase his sensual and intellectual experience (even if it is in order to go further in the discovery of transcendental frameworks). The Jewish philosopher on the other hand begins with the Torah, with a given creation, the law, the absent presence of the divine Creator. Because he undertakes to think this given together with the philosophical question, he is confronted by three fun- damental questions which challenge the entire biblical text and, in fact, ask in more philosophical terms, the question of the infinite, the relation to an infinite and perfect being with a finite and imperfect world. In other words, from the very beginning, the Jewish-philosopher confronts the question of revelation, of the manifestation of the infinite in the world of finiteness (the world, in this specific case, of the biblical text): *the question of language and of textuality: why is the Torah a narra- tive and prescriptive text if it is meant to make understood the unfolding of the logos! How can the infinite speak in a specific language (in this case, Hebrew)? How can it speak in the first place? It is the question of anthropomorphisms. *the question of God: if God is the Supreme Being, the One, the Good, what need is there to call Him by proper names? What need is there to languages in order to be able to be thought. Recourse to the concept of "Jewish phi- losophy" would be possible only when the adjective "Jewish" refers to this cross-roads of (four) languages circling around the Hebraic text, too intense to be said in its lan- guage. The adjective "Jewish" in "Jewish philosophy" would refer, then, to all the Jew- ish experiences, thinking and thinking themselves in the language of others and in conceptual articulation with Greek philosophy. "Jewish", that is what could not be said in any language exclusive of the others (and which, through this, could really have a hold on the universal). Because of this, from now on, we will write Jewish- philosophy for "Jewish", here, is not a predicate delimiting philosophy but is one with philosophising . What philosophically, is at stake is the addition of the "Jewish" reference, the adding on of something other to the philosophical concept which wants to be a totality. Can anything be added to the concept? Can it come outside of totality? Can the other come to us not in retrenchment, as a lesser-being but in the abundance of what is added on, what is excess? We can well see that this is the chief problem of Levinas' philosophy, who in this respect, can be counted as a real Jewish-philosopher! On all these questions, Cf.. S. Trigano, La demeure oubliée, genèse religieuse du politique (1984, second edition, Gallimard, "Tel", 1994), ( from now on LDO), entirely devoted to the study of the project of Jewish philosophy as one at the major paths of modernity and Philosophie de la loi, l'énigme de la politique dans la Tora (Cerf-Passages, 1991), which takes the question up again philosophically).</page><page sequence="5">(2001) Levinas and the Project of Jewish Philosophy 283 express Him in the language of the senses? It is the great theological question of the "attributes of God" which we see here. How can the infinite have a relation with the finite? *the question of the political community: if the Torah is the speech of the universal, why is it the story of the deeds of the Jewish people in particular, even if its story is always told as a responsibility to the other? How can the infinite have a single interlocutor, be it an individual (Moses, the prophet) or a collective (the people assembled at Sinai)? Here, the questions of the Law and the political community arise. It is in asking these questions (the question of the universal and the particular, of absence and of presence, of what is given and of freedom) that the Jewish philosopher connects the thought deriving from the Si- naitic book with Greek philosophical discourse. I perceive three great stages in the philosophical systems engendered by this questioning7: 1. The '' 'childhood of the art " The Philonic system that inaugurates Jewish philosophy brought the answer of the logos, of a mediation between infinite and finite, a logos which simultaneously separates and unifies. This logos preserves the in- tegrity and unity of God, for every contact of God with the finite and all the anthropomorphisms of the biblical text concern only the logos. De- spite its nature as mediator, however, Philo sometimes sees it as a real lieu-tenant (in place) of God, as a quasi divine being, to the point of defining him as a "second God" (deuteros theos), such that Christians will find here the foundation of their doctrine defining Jesus, "son of God", as God who has become man. Taking over the same concerns, Saadya Gaon invents the doctrine of the "created Glory". It plays the same role as the logos, the only differ- ence being that, here, contrary to Philo, the logos in question is "cre- ated" (and is thus artificial, instrumental) by God to communicate with human beings. The "Glory" (kavod), the divine agent in the world, is formed from a "created light" (zohar nivra). This is what appears of God. In this manifestation, the "speaking" of God (the dibbur, the Le- vinassian "saying") speaks. This dibbur is specially created and thus autonomous in relation to the visible manifestation. Moses, alone among the prophets, has heard the "saying" without the manifestation 7 S. Trigano, LDO. § XIII, 1 "La dynamique de la modernité", p. 332.</page><page sequence="6">284 Shmuel Trigano JSQ 8 of the "Glory", while all the other prophets - at a lower prophetic level - needed this manifestation in order to hear the divine voice. 2) The "great art" Maimonides introduces the notion of the negative and turns the givens of the "childhood of the art" completely upside down by formulating the following principle: "every attribute is either an attribute of action or, if its aim is to make understandable the essence of God (and not his action), it must be considered as the negation of what, in the attribute, is a lack" {Guide for the perplexed, I, 53). In short, for Maimonides, one cannot imagine God (the infinite being) positively, except by way of negation, or, more precisely, by way of the "nullification of lack" (She- lilat Haheader). As far as God is concerned, we must deny everything that we know through demonstration to be unacceptable about him. "The nullification of lack cannot be applied to a thing whose mode it could never be. I cannot say: "the wall cannot see", but only "the wall is a non-seeing thing" or "the wall is not blind". What is the problem here? For Maimonides, we cannot accept attributes which are anything else but the essence of the modified subject that they qualify, for they would add to the subject (and thus to the infinite) and thus would put it in the situation of being subject to accidents. The attribute which adds some- thing raises the question of the non-identity between essence and attri- bute. Maimonides sets aside the attributes that indicate the action of God and for the attributes concerning the essence of God (life, power, knowledge, will) he thus works out the negative interpretation of affir- mative propositions. Instead of saying: "God is powerful", one says: "God is not weak"; instead of saying: "God is one", one will say: "God is non-multiple". What is unacceptable to attribute to God (weak- ness and multiplicity) one keeps separate from God. We have an infinite proposition here ("A is non B"): it eliminates from an infinite number of possible attributes only one attribute. Thus infinity remains untouched. For Maimonides, this negation is the highest manifestation of a positive knowledge. 3) The decline After Maimonides, the fundamental Jewish-philosophical effort of working out a system relating the finite to the infinite will decline. So</page><page sequence="7">(2001) Levinas and the Project of Jewish Philosophy 285 will (in its conceptual version) the effort to relate the particular to the universal (for what is at stake on the level of the relation of God to the world is also at stake on the level of the relation of Israel to the nations of the world in history), in which Jewish uniqueness does not relinquish the universal. The common destiny of the universal and the particular will split apart and the (transcendental) Judaic will increasingly be thought as the destiny of the unique alone, without access or desire for the universal. This is the Spinozean moment of the Theologico-Political Tractate. If, nonetheless, there still exists a Jewish-philosophy after Spi- noza (who cuts the Judaic off from the universal to reduce it to the unique before decreeing its obsolescence), it is thanks to Mendelssohn. He will seek (in a limited way) to find a place for Jewish uniqueness in the midst of the universal (the modern political community). But the Judaic in his thought no longer has the force of the universal and it no longer has the daring to think it so that it can measure itself against it. With Mendelssohn, perhaps, we come to the end of Jewish-philoso- phy in its attempt to achieve an articulation with Greek philosophy in which both partners were equal (that is both at the level of the univer- sal), inscribing what is at stake in the Judaic (and in Jewish identity itself) within the totality proper to thinking about being, to speak in Levinassian terms. If Jewish-philosophy continues after Spinoza, its bases have been un- hinged in the following fashion: Jewish-philosophers, mostly Judeo-Ger- man, in contrast to their Judeo-Arabic counterparts, gave up on the historicity of Israel, which the latter had tried with all their might to inscribe within the universal. The essential mark of this historicity was the taking upon oneself of the polis and of the political, translated into fact by a discourse on the relationship of the Tora and the polis. Spinoza in the Tractatus, as in an apocalypse (for the Tractatus deals with the excellence of the State of Moses), eliminated this universality, by reduc- ing it to a political entity, defined as Jewish, that is to say, only particu- laristic and, in any case, defunct, in a perspective, where the universal is no longer at stake. There would no longer be a Jewish polis but Jews in a political community whose universality was out of their hands or, perhaps, a polis of Jews (Spinoza in fact left this possibility, henceforth deprived of meaning, open). Jerusalem became a suburb of Athens. What is at stake in the political no longer occurred within Judaism but outside it. It is upon the basis of this particularisation of Jewish being that the German- Jewish-philosophers will later build an idealist and universalist thought about Judaism, whose connection to the Jewish polis and to the political historicity of Israel will be only theoretical,</page><page sequence="8">286 Shmuel Trigono JSQ 8 even legendary (as in Mendelssohn) or denied (as in Rosenzweig), while the universalist ethicization of Judaism will swell up to a degree hitherto unknown, as if to compensate for the giving up of the politico-historical. The more historicity gave way, the more idealism gained ground. After Spinoza, Jewish-philosophy thus experiences a radical change on the level of the synthesis between the universal and the particular, in its confirmation of the non-relevance of the political and historical dimen- sion of Jewish existence. This is why mediaeval Jewish-philosophy pro- vides the classical paradigm of the Jewish-philosophical school, the only basis from which one can think out its history. The Legitimacy of the Enterprise Is our project to read Levinas within the perspective of Jewish philoso- phy legitimate? Does it do violence to the self - definition of Levinas, who never missed an opportunity to declare that he was a philosopher and Jewish but not a "Jewish philosopher"? One must, of course, keep in mind the intention of a thinker and the explanation he gives of his work. Nonetheless, familiarity with Jewish-philosophy leads one to see in Le- vinas' work, if not a reiteration of Jewish-philosophy, then, at least, an outgrowth, an unexpected revival. This is a real sign that the period of Jewish modernity of which Mendelssohn was a paradigmatic figure is being replaced by an as yet unclear period which, for lack of a better word, I will call "post-modern". In it, perhaps, something more than Jewish-philosophy is shaping itself but something which could be neither something less nor something other than it. Levinas has certainly written texts directly inspired by Judaism, his famous "Talmudic readings". But he took care to establish a division between his different inspirations, distinguishing his "philosophical" writings from his "confessional writings". He thus separates the writings defined as purely philosophical - pertaining to the logos even if they challenge it - from writings limited to the "religious" ("confession" in- dicates something yet more narrow than "religion": "faith", in the style of the 19th century). The chief problem that our approach presents de- rives precisely from the fact that we plan to interpret his philosophical text in the light of "Jewish-philosophy", that is, if we hold to Levinas' judgment, in the light of a "confession". One could ask upon which criteria Levinas' division between philo- sophical and confessional writing resides. Does it have to do with a textual criterion? Would the "confessional" be defined by the references</page><page sequence="9">(2001) Levinas and the Project of Jewish Philosophy 287 to the texts of the Talmud? It is true that in the philosophical texts, the silence about Jewish texts is rather loud. It is the reference to philosophy which dominates. The absence of the practice of "quoting" (the texts of Judaism) as well as the absence of semantic references to Hebrew is very noticeable in the philosophical works. In the end, Levinas cites only the Talmud and practically not the Bible, an intellectual feature character- istic of the Lithuanian Jewish tradition, his own. It is the rabbis' tradi- tion (that is consistent with the tradition of rabbinism that came out of the Talmud), leaning essentially on the Talmudic text and neglecting the biblical text as such or having access to it only through the hermeneu- tical grid of the Talmud. I would like to defend the thesis that the division Levinas makes between 'confessional' texts and 'philosophical' texts results from a stra- tegic choice and not from a claim about a difference in register in his thought. As we wish to demonstrate, this division in fact does not hold up to an intellectual investigation made on the basis of Jewish sources, whose impact on his thought in general is evident most of all in the philosophical texts (this explains why I will not deal with his so-called 'confessional' writings). Why did he use such a strategy in his work? Without invoking Leo Strauss, one must at this point refer to trivial realities. Had not Levinas sought shelter behind the formal proclama- tion of the 'philosophical' (non 'confessional', that is non Jewish) char- acter of his work, he would not have been taken as seriously as he was, in the first place by Christian thinkers and second by the secular ones, at the end of a long journey through the desert which is revealing about the reality of the French University and intellectual milieu, which is very secular indeed even anti-religious, all the more so when Judaism is at stake. It is through Levinas the philosopher, the phenomenologist that the Jewish Levinas could make a stage entrance. Thus, the 'philosophi- cal' writings hide the specificity which the confessional writings openly claim but the same Jewish particularity is present everywhere. Beyond its aspect as a strategy, this way of doing things teaches us, after all, about the objective status and condition of specificity and Jewish political ex- istence (historicity) in universality, in Levinas' set of questions. Nonetheless, if the Biblical is present in Levinas' philosophy only as something skipped over, his thought, for anyone with ears attuned to the Hebrew language, refers back in a massive way to a Hebraic register. Philosophical study of it is very often a sight translation of the Hebrew language within the French language. The best proof of such a hypothesis is that the often surprising terms of Levinas' language and thought can be explained when they are put back in the framework of Hebrew.</page><page sequence="10">288 Shmuel Trigamo JSQ 8 The Hebraicisms of Levinassian speech A few examples of some concepts, among many others, will illustrate this hypothesis. Take "proximity", for instance, a very strange concep- tion which sees in the coming closer to the other human being a loss of self which opens unto the other human being: "Proximity is a responsi- bility which does not send me back to my free condition of creator in a world in which nothing is at stake ... the condition of hostage8 "I come closer to the infinite by sacrificing myself. Sacrifice is the norm and the criterion of coming closer"9. "Proximity (indicates) rather the lack of mediation, an abrupt and sudden immediacy . . . The immediacy of proximity is the exact negation of spatial proximity, of "being in the neighborhood of"10. We are indeed in the presence here of the Hebrew korban, the Biblical "sacrifice", in which there is no sacer ("sacred" in the Latin meaning) at all but in which there is kerev, that is, "the near". The kerev is a sacrifice offered to the divine, a wholly other, to atone for a sin toward Him or toward the neighbor. By the gift and the divestment it brings about, the kerev is like a rupture of the synchronicity between myself and the other at the moment I draw closer to the other because it is a breakdown of the enclosedness of the self. This is what allows Marc Faessler11 to speak in a very Kabbalistic fashion of a "proximity in with- drawing", accomplished in order to escape all ensnarement. The notion of being "hostage" to the other, at the heart of Levinassian responsibil- ity, makes audible, from another angle, a correspondence between the term "responsibility", arev, whose root aruba gives us "guaranty" from which is derived ben aruva, "hostage". The concept of "Face" brings to mind the definition that Maimonides gives of panim, the face ( Guide 1,37): "The presence of a person on the spot in which he stands". He defines this presence through the notion of the "face-to-face", panim el panim, that is of a presence of one to the other without an intermediary. Maimonides evokes Deuteronomy 4:12: "You heard the sound of speech but saw no image, there was nothing but a voice". This, he tells us, is what has been called "face-to-face". Moses heard the (divine) voice without the mediation of an angel. The sentence: "And my face shall not be seen" (Ex. 33:13) also indicates the same meaning of "presence", that is the reality of existence as it is and as 8 EDE, p. 233. 9 DL II 119-120. 10 EDE 215, AE154. 11 M.

Verdier 198, p. 121.</page><page sequence="11">(2001) Levinas and the Project of Jewish Philosophy 289 it is incapable of being grasped. "The face does not express: it is expres- sion"12 says Levinas, in a similar vein. Maimonides brings up additional meanings of panim as well. First of all, an ethical meaning. Biblical Hebrew uses this term to indicate "respect", "attention", "caring" for the other human being (for example, in Lev 19:15: "You will have no consideration for the poor"). He also catalogues a usage oí panim as a time adverb: "formerly" (Ps. 102:106) to designate anteriority. Finally panim is an adverb of place meaning "in front" (the Targum of Onkelos, the Aramaic paraphrase of the biblical text, translates Ex 33:23 as fol- lows: "And those who are before Me cannot be seen"). Nothing reca- pitulates better Levinas's notion of the "Face" then these few lines of Maimonides. The Face as the other always precedes me in an anteriority which is not in the past tense, obligating me towards it from all eternity onward. If we now turn to the concept of the "there is" (illeity) which desig- nates "existence without beings 13, "being in general"14 and which has something terrifying about it ("the brushing against the there is is a feeling of horror"15, we cannot but think of the notion with which rab- binic thought expresses the idea of creation ex nihilo (yesh me-eyn: "the there is (drawn from) the there is not"). The terrible nature of the there is that of the abyss of the tohu-bohu of Genesis, indicating the moment equivalent to "the destruction of all things (which) would thus dissolve into an abstract presence, the presence of impersonal being"16. The "there is" is still very close to the non-being of the "there is not". It is this "there is not" that Faessler17 seems to recognize: "it is the "in" of the In-visible and the In-finite ... the distance that cannot be bridged". As a result, by the sheer fact of our existence we are "bound-to-the good", "the condition of the possibility of ethics". Indeed, in the He- brew in-finite (the eyn sof that is, "the there is no end") we go from the infinity of God to the finiteness of creation, by means of the in-, the "there is not"18. In God's withdrawal, creation comes forth. Why does the presence of the other human being "consist in coming toward us, in making an entrance, why is the epiphany of the face a 12 Sylvano Petrosino, Jacques Rolland La vérité nomade.

Why does its presence make an entrance? Because the word which indicates the act of reunion, the "assembly" (knesset, which will give us "synagogue" and ekklesia, church), comes from a root, kanes, meaning "entrance". If, to get together with others in Athens, one leaves home in order to go to the Agora, in Jerusalem, on the other hand, one "enters" one's home. It is inside, in the half dark, in concealment that the "other is encountered in his face"20. Finally, let us pay attention to the concept of "nudity": "in proximity, the skin is neither a container nor the protection of an organism, nor the straightforward surface of a being. Rather, it is nudity, a presence aban- doned by a departure, exposed to everyone and thus, also - unfaithful to itself - failing, but also handed over to things, contaminated, profaned, persecuted - at fault and in misery"21. This notion irresistibly suggests the biblical erva, designating a being as it is exposed to exteriority, con- sidered, in an untimely way, as perfected in a non-perfected word, re- maining in manifestation and in realization when being is, in virtuality, hidden22. There is a "nudity" of the human (it is incest) but also of the earth. Erva indicates all relationships in which there is a non-redeemed exteriority. (The goal of "sanctification" - in Hebrew, "separation" - is to hide the erva, nudity. Thus, to practice incest is said in Hebrew: "the unveiling of nudity"). There are innumerable exemples showing the underlying Hebraic structures in Levinas's thought. Why should this be astonishing? In phi- losophy, do we not always go back to Greek in order to think? The novelty here is that philosophy would be given a Hebraic soul or, put another way, that Hebrew would directly express itself in a philosophical language, in this case, linguistically speaking, French. This philosophical reading of Hebrew does not, to be sure, go without saying. It is the product of a subtle alchemy, of a labor, of a permanent coming and going between two registers. The Hebrew "hidden" in Levinas's philo- sophical language in fact brings to light all of its intellectual richness. 19 Cf. S.

We will limit ourselves in the context of this article to the problem of the relationship of the finite to the infinite which, as we have seen, is the key relationship. In the following few sentences taken from Totality and Infinity23, one is in the presence of a veritable journey across the history of Jewish philosophy. We will intersperse our own re- marks between these sentences: "The other is the very locus of metaphysical truth and is indispensable for my relation with God" One already notes that the other human being is in the classical position of the relationship of infinite and finite in Jewish-philosophy and is in the position of the logos or of the negative. "He does not play the role of a mediator" This is a critique of Philo and of Saadya "The other is not the incarnation of God" This is a critique of the Christian outgrowth of Philo' s philosophy. "But precisely by his face, in which he is disincarnate, he is the manifesta- tion of the height in which God is revealed" (pp. 77-78). This is Maimonides' position. "What is essential to created existence is its separation with regard to the infinite. " There is no better definition of the idea of creation ex nihilo. "This separation is not simply a negation. Accomplished as a psychological process. A critique of a simplistic Maimonidean position. "It opens precisely into the idea of infinity." (p 105). Maimonides' negative opens into a "mystic" void in the manner of Abu- lafia's conception. God or the Other Human Being. It is through the notion of the Face that Levinas conceives the relation- ship to the infinite, but in an altogether novel way, for the Face, as opposed to Philo's logos-Son of God is not fully a being, nor is it a created being as it is for Saadya, nor the negative of the world of posi- tivity, as it is for Maimonides. It un-defines itself in looking towards the infinite (the otherwise than being), thus positively but without positivity. 23 Pp. 51 et 78.</page><page sequence="14">292 Shmuel Trigano JSQ 8 "I am not saying that the other human being is God but that in his face I hear the word of God."24 The Other or the Face is at once the locus in which all human beings meet but it is also God creating the world ("as if the entire weight of the world rested upon his shoulders"25) and withdrawing himself, absenting himself from the world in exteriority. The Face is the trace: the void into which the world unfurled itself but at the same time the infinite insofar as it summons us and hails us and to which I respond like Abraham: "here am I!" In this sense, every subject is a substitution for the other human being, that empty space. The other human being sets the limit of the subject and exceeds this limit in the subject and outside the subject. To behold the other ("that which in the face expresses itself while re- maining hidden"26) is to be sent back to one's own void, to the discon- tinuousness of the self, which is nonetheless the condition of a coming closer. Levinas also uses in a surprising way Saadya Gaon's notion of "(cre- ated) Glory", (precisely with the same intention as Saadya: "to avoid the contamination of God by being.")27. "The glory which does not come to affect me as representation {this is Saadyä) nor as an interlocutor {this is Philo) before which and before whom I place myself, glorifies itself in my saying, commanding me through my mouth". "Interiority, as a result, is not a secret place somewhere within me. It is a reversal in which the eminently exterior... precisely because of this eminent exteriority, of this impossibility of being contained . . . infinite exception to essence con- cerns me and encircles me and commands me through my very voice. A command, ... the infinitely exterior becomes inner voice but a voice testifying to the fission of the inner secret, beckoning to the other." (Is it not God who manifests himself in the commandment?). In a word, it is as if Levinas had reworked Saadya's "glory", using Maimonides' negativisation, for there is something affirmative in the other human being but there is no positivity. He is the movement of creation (which is a sort of new take on the created nature of Saadya's glory.) It is the opening, the fissure through which creation occurs. But, in contrast to Maimonides, for whom the negative is determined in rela- tion to the positivity of the world, we have a turn-about: negative media- 24 "Philosophie, justice et amour, entretien avec Emmanuel Lévinas" in Esprit 28/10/ 1985, n° 20, "697", p. 13. 25 HAH, p. 50. 26 Pétrosino, op. cit., p. 109. 27 Cited by Lévinas in Némo, op. cit., p. 106-107, who reproduced this quotation drawn from A.

"That there could be a more than being or an above being is expressed in the idea of creation which, in God, exceeds a being eternally satisfied with itself."28 (This last definition evokes one of the biblical names of God (Sha- day), wrongly translated as "all-powerful" but which Jewish thought reads as the God "who (she) (has said) enough (day) to his own expan- sion and who nonetheless is also the God "who-has-enough" for him- self, who knows no diminution when creating the world). Thus glory (Kavod) is heavy (Kaved) with another being.29 "To support the universe is a crushing charge, but a divine discomfort"30? "Structured as a multi- plicity, creation is a dynamics. Multiplicity has as an inherent condition, the openness to what is different. The face is the very expression of the different, preventing me from possession and from enclosure within my- self. This obstacle is not a lessening but a rolling back to the recognition of the multiplicity that defines creation 31." Separation is conceived as being turned toward the other and not toward me. It generates the "face". Creation In Levinas' thought - many of his interpreters recognize this - the no- tion of creation has a distinct centrality. It could even be understood as a quasi-mystical (theological?) story of Creation (even though this story is essentially ethical, abstract and non-religious.) "A rigorous concept of creation which would be neither a negation nor a limitation (this is a critique of Maimonides) nor an emanation of the One (Kabbalah): exter- iority is not a negation but a marvel32." Let us not forget the problem for Jewish-philosophy that the idea of creation poses - another way of speaking about the relation of the finite to the infinite. This is no doubt the feature distinguishing Jewish-philosophy from Greek philosophy. Maimonides accepted everything from Aristotle except the idea of the 28 TI, p. 193. 29 RDD, Aleph, II "La volonté créatrice," p. 54. 30 AE, p. 157.

Creation, precisely as the withdrawal of God that opens unto his infinite proximity to the creature, is marked by an unbridgeable gap that Levinas approaches through the notion of "anteriority", of an-ar- che, which indicates the world a moment before it is created. It is a time out of mind and forever "lost", to which we cannot go (back). It will forever inscribe upon the creature the sign of its strangeness, of a de- position (the condition of the creature) at the basis of its position. (The creature is nonetheless free and autonomous, although created.) A clas- sic metaphor of midrashic thought can help us understand this: why does the Torah begin with the second letter of the alphabet (bet), if it is the text of the creation of the world? Why is the aleph skipped over, hidden? Anteriority is precisely this aleph, which is at the beginning but is kept silent, with the promise of being rediscovered in the future. The anterior is thus proclaimed as promise and future, which is precisely a turning upside down of the arche (an-archy), the apparent beginning of Genesis but whose appearance is illusory. If the real beginning is not in the manifest beginning, it becomes a promise. Anteriority shatters the totality of a time irremediably closed because it began positively. This is what, in Hebrew, can be indicated by the word Kedem, designating what came before. But in one of its inflexions, Kidma, it means "progress" (Kadima meaning "forward"). Thus one should not understand the prayer wishing "renew our days as before (Kedem)" as signifying the going back to a golden age but as a projection into an unheard of future, although already there from the beginning, a theme we have developed elsewhere. But this anteriority, another name for the other human being, preced- ing the other and the same, is, in Levinas' thought, the occasion for a very mysterious narration, for a plot concerning what he calls "elec- tion". I could define "election" in Levinas' thought as the epic of the other, or else as the story of creation, be it from the point-of-view of the creator or from the point-of-view of the creature. The "the other human being" is structurally in the position of logos, of created glory, of the not-without-a-name (the Unnamed, the negative of lack) of Maimonides, which one can discern by way of negation, as if "the whole weight of creation rested upon (his) shoulders".33 I write incorrectly the "the other human being" ( in French, V Autrui, when it 33 Cf. RDD, Mem II, 2,3 § "Le temps retrouvé du vav renversif ", p. 244, and PDL, Introduction "Du commencement en politique," pp. 1 1 et seq.</page><page sequence="17">(2001) Levinas and the Project of Jewish Philosophy 295 is usually said Autrui, without the definite article) an expression that Levinas would have vigorously opposed (for the other human being is neither an individual nor a person), but I resort to the definite article ("the") to indicate it from the point-of-view of an outside observer who would compare this concept to those within Jewish-philosophy which are formally close to it. The fact that Levinas says "the face" and not "face" emboldens us in this direction (even if the face does not manifest itself through its qualities, Kat'auto, but expresses itself).34 The "the Other", the face, can also be qualified, have qualities attrib- uted to it. (The alterity of the other human being is as if a "quality in itself but not a quality of the other"35). These qualities are way beyond the negative (of Maimonides): responsibility, alterity, nudity, weakness, vulnerability, proximity, guilt ; separation, substitution, the condition of hostage. For Levinas, it is not a matter, to be sure, of "attributes" in the sense in which we speak of the "attributes of God" for none of these qualities is added on to the subject, to the other human being. They themselves constitute the subject. There are not definitions of a positive being: they are like the trace, the presence of what has never been there, of what has always passed, of what disturbs the order of the world. The "the Other" has no place but it is the place of places. Let us take as an example the attribute "goodness", a more directly theological notion which defines election. Levinas evokes "the original goodness of crea- tion"36, characteristic of the pre-original (the Kedem): "The good con- fers freedom ; it loves me before I have loved it. Through this anteriority, love is love37. I call this definition (with some slight intent to provoke) "theological"38 (even if in my conception there cannot be - in Jewish- philosophical terms - a logos of God (a theo-logy) for logos, created glory, designates God only insofar as he establishes a relationship with the world) for this "goodness" irresistibly evokes the hesed of Talmudic and Kabbalistic thought. Hesed is grace, gratuitous generosity (short of, and at the same time, a surplus beyond justice within which God created the world. Levinas himself evokes39 a very meaningful midrash which 34 HAH, p. 50. 35 EE, p. 161. 36 AE, p. 156. 37 AE, p. 13 (note7). 38 E. Lévinas, "Envers autrui"..., op. cit., p. 291. 39 «why are there two accounts of creation? Because the Eternal - called Elohim in the first account - had wanted at first - all this is only a moral fable, of course - to create a world based exclusively on justice. It would have not lasted. The second ac- count, in which the Tetragrammaton appears, attest to the intervention of mercy". Levinas' reservation ("all this is only a moral fable, of course") is very meaningful.</page><page sequence="18">296 Shmuel Trigano JSQ 8 relates that God had created thousands of worlds before ours but that they could not stand because they rested on justice alone. It is only when "he added on" grace, that the world could stand, and this is our world, which I would define as the apex of goodness! We find this again in the idea of "the overflowing of the infinite"40. Not only is the creature called to excess (the "overflowing") despite the separation from God in which it finds itself, but also this separation, the process of the "otherwise than being", does not annul the promise of unity for the human being, ap- parently at the opposite end of the separation. We have here a reversal of perspective: the (Lurianic) withdrawal of God, defined as exteriority, is seen from the angle of the open fullness of the infinite and not from that of the lack resulting from withdrawal. The other no longer limits the same. The same is supported, (un)defined by what is greater than it, the "the Other", the unlimited. Otherwise than the Text or "Beyond the verse" This definition of goodness and the "attributes" of the "the Other hu- man being" show both the difficulty of our demonstration and the orig- inality of Levinas's thought. Everything is in fact very close to Jewish- philosophy and everything is very different from it, for Levinas' reading of the themes of Kabbalah and Talmud is ethical. And this is what is new (not in the sense that ethics would have been missing from the ear- lier works but that here the interpretation is nothing but ethics). This is what makes it difficult for me to demonstrate my point fully, for it is very clear that in Levinas' discourse itself the "the Other human being" does not play the role that Saadya's "created glory" once played. It is not even certain that the God of the otherwise than being is the biblical God. What, earlier, in classical Jewish-philosophy, was attributed to God or dissociated from this infinity - insofar as it is turned toward the human being - seems, in Levinas' thought, to have to do as much with man in his moral life as with God. "Epiphany comes in the saying of him who received it"41; "the revelation is made by him that receives it"42 But this does not necessarily suppose a divine presence behind man, "as if the entire structure of creation rested upon his shoulders43." "Rev- elation can occur without making of God the theme of a religious shock or of a received knowledge (which would interpret him in terms of 40 TI, pp. 268-269. 41 AE, p. 190. 42 AE, p. 199.</page><page sequence="19">(2001) Levinas and the Project of Jewish Philosophy 297 presence, immanence)."44 The radical nature of Hebraic monotheism, is, on the other hand, more clear-cut. The terminology Levinas uses is very disturbing from this point-of- view: it refers to the human before anything else, all the while indicating more than the human. Without even a passing glance, the order is re- versed: "revelation is made by him who receives it45". In this last pro- nouncement, one could find something that has already been said in Jewish-philosophy: anthropomorphic attributes (that seek to define God in human terms) answer to the need of man, to the language of man but they do not answer God's "need" (He has no such need). Nonetheless, if it is obvious that for Philo or Saadya Gaon the "logos" or the "created glory" takes the shape of a man ("the appearance of a man, the Ancient of days", says the prophet Daniel (7:9), quoted by Saadya Gaon in this instance46), God is kept apart from such a likeness (which is more precisely the deepest concern of Maimonides). In this, while Levinas obviously relies on some elements of the philo- sophy of Kabbalah and of Talmud, he nonetheless positions himself out- side the Jewish-philosophical project and outside of the intellectual "ob- ligations", outside the inevitable "obstacle course" deriving from it. For him, language (just like the attributes of God) does not constitute a philosophical problem. "The statement of the beyond being of the Name of God does not let itself be imprisoned in the conditions of its enunciation47." But the chief philosophical problem for the Jewish-phi- losopher is that he must start to think with a text, the Book of Moses. The question of the book is considered settled for Levinas. It does not constitute a problem. As a result, he has no need of allegory, of prophet- ic interpretation: "The God of the Biblical verse can no longer serve as proof, the God of the Biblical verse, despite all the anthropomorphic metaphors of the text, can remain adequate to thought for the philoso- pher48." "We have called face autosignificance par excellence.49" "The presence of the other human being or expression is the source of all meaning50." "Without mediation (the other human being) means by himself." This is as much as to say that, like the biblical God, he slips 43 HAH, p. 50. ** haessler, op. cit., p. 135. 45 AE, p. 147. 46 AE, p. 199. 47 Cf.

The (revealed) text is no longer held by the philosopher as a mirror of the sign: it induces a journey across itself without, for that matter, leading somewhere. Language is no longer a sign, but is intrinsic meaningfulness. This is what Petrosino52 calls "the epiphany of the infinite, but it is nonetheless neither the sign nor the image nor the icon of God. Not referring to anything it refers. This is what Levinas expresses when he distinguishes the "saying" from "the said", preferring the saying. The "saying" precedes all ontology, pre- cedes the said. It is a locus of truth and beyond language. This event precedes any communication of a context and is in relation with the other human being. The saying is pre-original, an-archic, a meaningful- ness lent to the other, before any objectification. This saying makes one think of the conception of Saadya Gaon: the "speaking", the dibbur, speaks in "glory" (the Kavod), for the prophets of limited spiritual rank who need a concrete vision in order to hear the divine word. Moses heard the "saying" without needing to see the glory. In the Biblical text relating the Mosaic deeds we frequently find the expression: "YHWH spoke (vaydabber) to Moses in order to say (lemor)" or "Elohim spoke (vaydabber) to Moses and said to him (vayomer): I am YHWH." (Ex. 6,2). From another angle, for Talmudic hermeneutical thought the "say- ing" (lemor) always indicates an incestuous potentiality in human rela- tions. "The said which speaks of it translates the ineffable only at the price of a betrayal which thought is at every moment called to dimin- ish53." With Levinas, the Jewish-philosopher no longer has to make the words that say God in the text coincide with the idea of God . "The ideatum of the infinite surpasses its idea54." "The infinite presents itself anarchically, but thematisation loses the anarchy which alone can ac- credit it. Language about God rings false or becomes a myth, that is, can never be taken literally55. We are far from Maimonides for whom it is by "convention" (politeness-law, for here the Hebrew nimus [polite- ness] comes from the Greek nomos ( law) that one can imagine in lan- guage a relation between two beings of whom one has absolutely noth- ing in common with what is outside him (Guide to the Perplexed, I, 52). This "convention" is blurred in Levinas' thought ("language speaks in the place where the commonality between terms is missing56" who no 51 EDE, p. 194. 52 Petrosino..., p. 104. 53Faessler..., p. 141. 54 TI, p. 19. 55 AE, p. 155. 56 AE, p. 45.</page><page sequence="21">(2001) Levinas and the Project of Jewish Philosophy 299 longer feels obligated to probe into the status of language. "The relation with language supposes the transcendence of radical separation, the for- eignness to each other of the interlocutors, the revelation of the other to me. Language is spoken at the moment that the commonality between the terms of the relations is missing57." Likewise, Rashi remarks that when God speaks to men, strangely, "he speaks to himself58." At bottom, Levinas bypasses the text as obstacle or threshold of the true. The text becomes an occasion for a journey toward the "otherwise than the text". This thought is neither a commentary nor an interpreta- tion, even if it obviously derives from the text. One therefore does not find in his thought the laborious back-and-forth between the "letter" and the "spirit", dear to Philo. Nor do we find the word-for-word trans- lation of the Bible into the philosophical language of the beginning of the Guide to the Perplexed, nor Maimonides' theory of allegory. Hebrew is no longer explained in Greek: Greek is considered to be speaking Hebrew directly. The Bible text is no longer an obstacle to philosophiz- ing. Otherwise than Being and Totality and Infinity are presented as de- riving their authority from themselves, Levinas citing the Bible here and there but without being bound to it, as if going beyond it. Following very logically from this, Levinas, in this trajectory, does not ask himself the classical question of Jewish-philosophy: the connection between the particular and the universal. Above all, he does not ask about the destiny of the particular (in this case, about the "letter" from Sinai, about the God of Judaism and about the Jewish people) confronting a universal in full glory. In Levinas' thought, the philoso- phical intention is quite different. Far from defending the universal, as his predecessors have done, led as they were to reduce the particular in the Sinaïtic text, he goes to war against it as totality. But this critique lands neither in particularism nor even in a thought about the historical particularity of the Jewish sign. "While speaking of our universalism - as strange as it might seem, and as self-contradictory - we wanted it to be a "particularistic universalism." The Jew does not want to be a uni- versalist by evaporating, by sublimating himself, by turning himself into thin air. He wants, on the contrary, to be universal within the conscious- ness of his particularity. It is, in any case, the very mystery of the moral phenomenon. I am the only one capable of performing the moral act. I have to be the most emphatically myself to perform the sacrifice which is 57 Idem. 58 PDL, Livre II, chap. VI "La voix du signe prophétique et l'éthique politique", § 1, "II n'y a rien à communiquer".</page><page sequence="22">300 Shmuel Trigamo JSQ 8 the supreme morality. We are all for a universal humanity, a great human family, but a great human family founded on the basis of my unique consciousness of my irreplaceable duty, which institutes as em- phatically as possible my existence as person59." The universalization of the unique This is where the difficulties deepen when one starts from the categories of Jewish-philosophy, for Jewish-philosophers always feel obligated to define and to establish (justify?) Jewish-collective-being, an identity or sameness facing the universal, even to propose for it, like Maimonides, a political constitution. This move is in fact almost inevitable, since Jew- ish-philosophy starts with the hypothesis that the forms of uniqueness (the text, the people, the God of Israel) carry the universal. In Levinas' thought, the story of election (despite its strong contemporary and non- classically Jewish connotation of "hostage" and "persecution", relating to the Shoa) is no longer that of the people of the covenant but that of every human being who thus finds himself called and chosen because he is a creature. "Each person must act as if he were the Messiah60." "Each time Israel is mentioned in the Talmud, one is certainly free to under- stand by this term a particular ethnic group . . . but . . . one would have forgotten that Israel signifies a people who has received the Law and, consequently, a human nature which has reached the fullness of its responsibilities and its self-consciousness61." In the end, Levinas repeats the acts of the Pharisees: he extends the demanding condition of the great priest (demanding from the point-of-view of moral purity) to all human beings. The Pharisees, in order to oppose the priestly caste and to do away with its mediation, had extended it (morally and vitally) to all Jews. The process of negativization that Maimonides had applied to the Divinity is applied by Levinas to the "people of Israel". We once again discover the ethical dimension and its generality. "An ethics with law, without concepts", Derrida could say62. In Levinas's thought, the particular or the unique, if it is conceived and valorized as dismembering totality (the Talmud, "the special disci- 59 Discours de clôture du Colloque des intellectuels juif s ...

This guards from ideology63.") is not, despite this, the opposite of the universal. It becomes universalised, in a paradoxical manner, "frac- tured" by and toward otherwise than being. "In this election, I am not a "particular case" of the universal (which would suppose a universal concept of self). It is me as a unique I (that is, resisting the concept) which is at stake64." Election is affirmed but without thematisation. It consists, in fact, in divesting itself, emptying itself of its being65." Levi- nas also speaks of "the dislocation of the self in relation to itself66", thinking, no doubt, of the limping of the patriarch Jacob, whose hip was dislocated after his struggle with the angel. Thus, all the theological categories of the elected Israel are brought back to the abstract subject. Subjectivity is defined by election, that is, by a non-identity. The effect of this is to extend the category of Israel (classically understood by Judaism as a "dis-identity 67"). But, in exchange, it bypasses the ques- tion of the "place" of Israel, one of the most important obstacles against access to the universal for Jewish-philosophers. The question of the fi- niteness of the historical Israel, of its "selfhood68" is thus avoided. In the otherwise than being, the unique is in fact thought in relation- ship to excess, to surplus. It is not lacking vis-à-vis the universal. In such a manner we can understand - he carries the universe: "the self is sub- jectum, it is under the weight of the universe, responsible for every- thing69." Would this explain why there is no "economy" (necessarily founded on the principle of scarcity and penury) of the universal and the particular in Levinas' thought? Can one still say, paraphrasing Der- rida, that we have here a conception of the "universal in its Jewish, not Greek, particularity?" It is no doubt by way of this conception of the unique and the parti- cular, which is at the same time a concept of the universal, that Levinas innovates in relation to the heritage of Jewish philosophy. He stands in sharp contrast to its most classical problematic, by throwing overboard its aporias and the principle of scarcity which undergirds its entire think- ing. In this respect, he would be closer to the principle of abundance and flow which energizes Kabbalistic thought. In positing the unique as be- 63 ADV, pp. 98f. 64 AE, p. 131. 65 AE, p. 149. 00 BE, p. 50. 67 PDL, Livre II, chap.

But in universalizing it, on principle, through the image of the election of the subject, he cuts it off from historicity . Perhaps he thus plays out to the end a profound tendency of Jewish philosophy, which always had trouble with the historico-political (the letter, the flesh, the community, the people, Jewish social being, the language, the names of God, etc.) but which did not necessarily always cross over71 to what, in Levinas's thought, is silently equivalent to an extreme circumventing of the Jewish sign. The unique is present everywhere but remains, in fact, unthought, infinitized, no longer posing any problem. Why would it pose any? Be- yond totality, it is rather an indicator and an affirmation . No doubt, in the most classical Jewish consciousness, election is a de-position, a dis- identification, a responsibility for the other human being. Nonetheless, the Jewish consciousness which conceived of such an ethic (remaining for the Jews a horizon, a model in the future tense toward which to aspire) always experienced the necessity of accounting for it, of assum- ing in history and in the face of human beings the responsibility for this responsibility for the other. It is because they conceived the project of the universal as "for the other" that Jewish philosophers undertook to "give an account" of Judaic uniqueness and particularity. This was not in order to exalt its identical sameness but, on the contrary, to trace a boundary between this uniqueness and the universal, which it dreams of bearing within it. As I see it, this boundary corresponds, in fact, to a double demand, both historical and moral. A historical one, because the Jews and Juda- ism exist in reality (Is it indecent to recall it? Jewish existence is also a historical condition). If one puts forward such a universalizing aim, evidently marked by "Judaism", one must certainly know the status (no doubt transcendental in Levinas's thought) of this Judaic aspect in relation to the non- Jewish world and especially in relation to the socio- logical Jew himself who (like every human being) rarely totally incar- nates such a moral stature. This move is all the more necessary in a period in which, following the shock of the Shoa, the Jews are going through a time of reestablishing and restoring their unique identity. All the more so since they now wield power and no longer experience the 70 PDL, Livre III, § I "La théorie de la part gardée". 71 This was the case for Philo's followers (with Christianity and Karaism), it was the case for Maimonides (with the allegoricalist philosophers who followed) and for Men- delssohn (with the Enlightenment movement), a recurring phenomenon which shows well that there is in this line of thought a temptation to bypass the unique in the design of the universal.</page><page sequence="25">(2001) Levinas and the Project of Jewish Philosophy 303 condition of victim. It would be a mystification to think about power behind the façade of the ethics of victimhood, of the 'hostage of the other'. From this point-of-view, to determine the status of Jewish "iden- tity", as such, is a condition of moral health and of honesty in the relationship with the other and not the sign of a particularistic apolo- getic. It is ethically imperative to think the unique in order for the hori- zon of the other to come into view. The universal is indeed a dangerous game which can lead to totality and to the negation of the other. To determine the status of the unique is to avoid such a development. It does not seem possible to act as if, by starting from Judaism, one were immediately in the universal, thus skipping over historicity. This ideal (the Levinassian vision) can only be the conclusion of an effort, a test of reality in immanence which is, above all, a testimony of modesty, vis-à- vis the other. The fact that Levinas does not take on this test explains why he re- mains at bottom insensitive to the political while in Jewish-philosophy, hermeneutical theory is simultaneously a theory of the political commu- nity. Maimonides thinks about the Jewish community in the midst of a system of the text: the prophet, a master of allegory, of the double mean- ing of the text, is the only one capable of governing the City. He brings together in his discourse (commentary) the wise man and the unedu- cated crowd, who do not have access to the same comprehension of the text72. Philo, for his part, in a very topological manner, opposes the mikropolitaï, the citizens of a small state (who keep to the letter), to the citizens of the world, who keep to the spirit73. Nothing of any of this in Levinas. The eclipse of the political could be structural in his thought, even if a few texts try to demonstrate the contrary. But, think- ing the political is urgent in such an enterprise for it is to consider the criterion of the ethical validity of the project of the universal, simulta- neously in regard to the other and to oneself. This is the very condition for a critique of the self, measured against the transcendental model which, otherwise, runs the risk of becoming an ideology rationalising the failures of the real. The boundary also corresponds to a moral exigency, that which the relation to the other brings with it. We find ourselves here in the debate with Buber on reciprocity. If I can share with Levinas his conception of anteriority, of an-archy, I can accept less his definition of the election of the subject as absolute passivity, especially when we go from the level of 72 LDO, op. cit., Livre premier, §IV "Maïmonide". 73 Idem, Introduction, I, "L'homme à l'image de Dieu".</page><page sequence="26">304 Shmuel Trigamo JSQ 8 transcendence to the level of individual or collective existence. This con- ception is a sort of Protestantization of Judaism because of the meta- physical predestination which it could involve. On the other hand, if the condition of the 'hostage of the other' is understandable on the ethical plane, it is unacceptable on the political plane, for it could lead to tyr- anny. This definition of the condition of the subject could in fact become a strident caricature whose dimensions can be grasped in the Jewish experience of the Shoa, 'that concrete projection of Calvary and of all human suffering, a concrete symbol of humanity which learns to recog- nize itself, and a providential préfiguration of a future messianic human- ity'74. One could conclude that for Levinas the Jewish tradition defines itself in terms of radical victimhood. One can surmise that no Jew today would accept it in practise, neither in the Diaspora nor in Israel, for the entire Jewish resurgence since the war occurred in opposition to such a destiny. We have here two different spheres which must be separated in order for the political not to be corrupted. Levinas perceives this well when he feels obligated to specify ; "I am responsible for the persecu- tions I suffer but only I! My "relatives" or "my people" are already the others and for them I demand justice75." In the area of politics, even limited, even illusory, human relations cannot be founded on the suspen- sion of freedom76, of the will, of engagement, in a word, of the "cove- nant". We notice regarding this, within this perspective, how much the notion of "covenant", so central in the biblical text, seems surprisingly missing in Levinas' writings, even if we can find in the idea of fracture, characteristic of proximity, an element of the notion of covenant. (In Hebrew, one says "to break a covenant" in order to mean "to make a covenant"77.). But it is this notion which constitutes in Judaism the prism of the relation between finite and infinite (God and human beings), of the particular and the universal (Israel and the nations), of the spirit and existence (Israel and itself). Michel Haar expresses a simi- lar worry: "The other ... is non-place, outside-place. Can an ethics (ethos means "a stay" or "customs") unfold outside of all places, outside of all positive reciprocity, and of all objectification78?

Levinas separates the concept of re- sponsibility from that of liberty and intelligibility. On the contrary, he connects "responsibility" to the most radical passivity . . . How to think of a gift which would be torn from a pure passivity80? Levinassian re- sponsibility and, consequently, Levinassian ethics is paradoxically not a relation or a communication but an unrelative movement, absolute, in- ternal to the subject81. Can the self ... deprived of a centre as well as of periphery . . . still encounter the other and what can he bring him82? If every one in particular is a non-space, always threatened by everyone together, no community can be established . . . Should we not rehabilitate the self against the literally unbearable excess of the other?83" In contradistinction to this last intention, in my mind, the question lies not in rehabilitating the same but above all, in not avoiding the question of the unique and therefore of historicity and of the political. It is the condition, as I see it, of the capacity of being "for the other". This is why I underscore the importance of the political, which is the very realm in which the disjunction between the universal and the unique, utopia and the real must take place. This disjunction, in that it is at once a separation of the self and the other and also the way to their covenant (cf. the covenant as brit I break)84 is the very condition of the possibility of the other. Does the covenant, which necessarily involves the voluntary act of two separate individuals insofar as they are placed in the world of reality and who thus reunite, still have a place in Levinas' philosophy? This is the biggest question I ask myself when I try to resi- tuate this philosophy in the perspective of "Sinai". Perhaps light can be shed on Levinas' thought - exactly on the critical aspects that we have just indicated - by looking at the historical situa- tion in which it comes about: the post-war period. Its range is much greater, in fact, when it is placed in the context of the Shoah than when it is placed in the context of the contemporary Jewish condition in a world in which Jews are no longer necessarily the victims. Would not the universalization of (Judaic) uniqueness that Levinas undertakes de- rive, in fact, from the experience of the Catastrophe? Right after the Shoah, Levinas writes, it was as if an obligation existed to "maintain within the persecuted his human essence85." It is as if in the destruction 79 Idem, p. 525. 80 Ibid, p. 530. 81 Ibid, p. 532. 82 Ibid, p. 533. 83 Ibid, p. 536. 84 Ibid, p. 537. 85 PDL, Livre II, Chap.

It is as if, in the midst of destruction, cut off from humanity, the Jews had gathered in all the humanity of their time. "In the Shoah, Israel was called to die the death of all, to go to the very end of death86." To find, at the moment the Jews were coming out of abandonment, having just been destroyed as a particular people87, such strength and such an aim toward the universal in Jewish consciousness shows the heroic nature of the Levinassian project and its true importance. But, on the historical plane, it is Jewish specificity which was exterminated in the Shoa and it is Jewish specificity that the Judaism of the post-war period tried to redeem. With Levinas, we no doubt have, and it has been little noticed, the great philosophical thought of the period after the Shoa. This observa- tion only accentuates the questions we have raised. Does not Levinas himself announce that "Jewish uniqueness awaits its philosophy88?" Of course, so that it can "become heavy" with the universal, which is its promise and its "glory". Jewish specificity is thus at the center of philo- sophical questioning for contemporary Jews, the opposite of what was the case in the modern period. But the stakes go beyond the limits of Jewish collective being. And perhaps it is precisely in this that its experi- ence is a source for a universal teaching. The destiny of the unique is indeed the crucial question of modern history and politics, in a still more radical way after the Shoa. This is why the 'ethical' current which has dominated modern Jewish-philosophy cannot cross the threshold (in the form of a rupture) which the Shoa represents in its history. If Jewish- philosophy has a future, it is only at the expense of a radical transforma- tion in which it will rediscover the question of the political insofar as it is of another nature than the realm of subjectivity, of interiority and of the interpersonal. The universal, the neo-Kantian principle of ethics in Ju- daism came out of the Shoa in shambles. It is a meditation upon the elements of the real, metaphysics as well as history, which henceforth impose themselves upon Jewish thought. If we had to find a summariz- ing formula, we would say that if the other human being precedes me from all eternity - which we accept (such that we would back off from the idea of a radical reciprocity), in history, the entire stake is that I 86 DL II, p. 362. 87 Le "614 ème commandemenfin L'Arche n°291, p. 55. 88 Cf.
