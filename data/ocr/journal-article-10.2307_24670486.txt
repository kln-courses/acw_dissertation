Edited by Yaron Z. Eliav, Elise A. Friedland, and Sharon Herbert. (Interdisciplinary Studies in Ancient Culture and Religion, 9). Leuven-Dudley, MA: Peeters, 2008. Pp. 769. Paperback. €85.00. ISBN 978-90-429-2004-0. The "mass media" of the Roman world, statues, are the subject of this impressive volume: almost eight hundred pages, enriched by figures and maps, a rich bibli ography and a useful index, which focus on the eastern shores of the Mediterra nean, Syria, Arabia, Judea, and also Egypt, Asia Minor and Persia, during five hundred years, from the second to the seventh century C.E. The purpose is that of revealing their cultural contexts, significance and meanings, examining the political, religious and social messages they convey. The essays presented, stemming from an international conference that took place at the University of Michigan and the Toledo Museum of An in the autumn of 2004, investigate Roman sculpture from multiple perspectives, encompassing the manifold disciplines and fields of research involved, from art history to archaeology, classics to history, and folklore to religion. Statues offer an excep tional opportunity to study a class of "material culture" used throughout the Roman world and to investigate the complex matrix that emerges from the encounter between people and the physical reality in which they lived. First of all, Part I deals with cultural patterns: the differences between the Hel lenism of the Roman Near East and that of the Byzantine Near East (by Bower sock); the cultural ambiguity emerging from the Syrian world, where language, housing and religion show that Greek and local worlds interlock, conflict with, and supplement each other (by Sartre). (Similar conclusions also emerge from Friedland's examination—see Part IV—of the disparate depictions of one specific deity, Athena and Athena-Allat, throughout the regions of eastern Mediterra nean, where universal characteristics conflate with local visual traditions). As for Judea, the opposition to Hellenism operating in previous times apparently soft ened in the early centuries C.E., a development identified by Oppenheimer with the decline in the attractiveness, and thus threat, of pagan worship. Part II discusses the origin, production and later fate of sculpture in the Roman Near East. It is in Judea, Foerster argues, that the richest discoveries of marble sculpture of the Roman period in the Near East have been found; issues of space arrangement and location within the urban fabric are dealt with by Rockwell, who reconstructs the tools and techniques of the artists, as well as the perceptions of the buyers, while Tsafrir examines the role of the classical tradition in the late antique period. This part ends with two articles by Trombley and PolliniPollini that explore how statues were used, reused, damaged or destroyed. Cases of bust-crowns intentionally and systematically destroyed by Christians are exam ined by Pollini, who also expands on the Roman governments attitude toward other religions.

Probably not, and Pollini is probably correct in relating the imperial decision to the destruction by Jews of the altar set up by Greeks at Jamnia. On the other hand, is this enough to prove "insanity" on the part of the Jews? Pollini s forthcoming article (cf. 190, note 54) is entitled "The 'Insanity' of Caligula or the 'Insanity' of the Jews." One may also wonder whether we are entitled to relate this episode with the events which had taken place in Alexan dria one year before, and, moreover, whether the anti-Jewish pogrom may be really regarded "rioting between Jews and Greeks in Alexandria, in which Greeks and Jews were equally culpable" (192, note 61), a highly speculative conclusion. The destruction of statues is treated by Frankfurter, too, at the end of the vol ume, in a fascinating essay which shows that in Egypt the destruction of statues by Christians went hand in hand with the well-attested contemporary appeal and continuation of the traditional Egyptian divine cult of images. Part III is devoted to two-dimensional landscapes: representing statues in other media such as wall paintings, mosaics, and inscriptions originally attached to free-standing statues. Part IV deals with godly matters. Stewart examines divine, non anthropomorphic "aniconic" objects, primarily stones that did not "depict" the gods but were regarded as embodying them: sacred stones, usually called "baetyls," which did not belong to the primitive prehistory of Greco-Roman art, but coexisted with more conventional images through the Roman imperial period. The following four articles, along with those of Sartre and Friedland in Parts I and II, constitute an excellent contribution to the study of the Hellenistic culture in the East, focusing on various kinds of combinations of "classical" rep resentations with local indigenous iconographic motifs and practices in different sites such as Petra, southern Syria, Palmyra and Dura-Europos. In Part V, the functions of sculptures at Antioch, Ascalon, Caesarea Maritima and Sepphoris are examined in their urban context, while Part VI focuses on social, political and religious issues connected with statues, arguing for a mytho logical framework instead of an allegorical one (Isaac), and against the common opinion that Jewish and Christian reactions to Roman statuary were always hos tile (Eliav). Focusing on the Babylonian Talmud, Kalmin concludes that some Palestinian and Babylonian rabbis found idol worship "far more attractive than scholars imagined." The question, however, may be asked: who were the persons attracted to polytheism? Phenomena such as the vitality of pagan cults in the time of the Mishnah and the Talmud and economic and confessional aspects of Jewish attrac tion to polytheism have recently been thoroughly examined by Emmanuel Fried heim in a number of articles and in a monograph published in 2006 (Rabbinisme(Rabbinisme etet Paganisme en Palestine romaine: etude historique des Realia talmudique (I-TVsie cles),cles), Leiden-Boston 2006). From these works it emerges that since the rabbinic material often offers us a narrow legalistic or moralistic look at a social and reli gious reality much more complex and wide—and it is not always clear whether</page><page sequence="3">Review of Books / Journal for the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 366-438 389 the attitudes towards paganism found in the haggadah and in the halakah reflect theory or historical reality—it is always necessary to combine these sources with archeological, epigraphical and literary testimonies. The whole picture confirms that in the period of the Mishnah and the Talmud, for religious conviction or for economic necessity, Jews were found who did partake of pagan cults, a phenom enon bitterly denounced by rabbinic authorities. This may be the "anxiety" which Kalmin recognizes in the passages quoted: in this case, however, this anxiety may well betray polemic concerning an undesirable reality, not an indication that "the rabbis were struggling to convince themselves that idolatry was worthless" (631). Of course, controversial essays are often the most stimulating ones, and we may be grateful to the editors and to the authors: these articles, which display remarkable scholarship, greatly enrich our knowledge in a wide range of domains and will certainly enhance further research.
