Knight ABSTRACT Western Montana rock art comprises 29 picto graph sites scattered throughout the mountainous Pacific-drained portion of the state. The sites, composed of panels of simple red, yellow or black pictographs, cluster along the major streams in the region. A variety of zoomorphic, anthropomorphic and geometric designs predominate. Traditionally Western Montana rock art has been assumed to be related to the rock art of the Northwestern Plains, however, this study demonstrates that functionally and stylistically its closest relationships are with Columbia Plateau rock art. Two style zones, each reflecting a different cultural influence, are recognized in the region. The majority of sites apparently served as vision quest sites for Salishan tribes that inhabited the area during the Late Prehistoric Period. A few sites in the extreme southern portion of the region are attributed to Shoshoneans, and relate most closely to the pictographs of central and southern Idaho. Although numerous rock art sites are scattered throughout mountainous Western Montana (Fig. 1), little is known about them aside from a few superficial site reports. To remedy this situation the University of Montana Statewide Archaeological Survey conducted an inventory of Western Montana rock art during the summer of 1974. Twenty-nine pictograph sites were located. Because the region offers varied environ ments, and because it is peripheral to both the Northwestern Plains and the Columbia Pla teau, a mixing of cultural traits might be expected. In this paper we will demonstrate that although influences from both the Plains and Plateau are known ethnographically and archaeologically, the rock art is most closely affiliated with the rock art of the Columbia Plateau in Washington, Idaho, and British Columbia. Typically, Western Montana pictographs are located on relatively inaccessible cliffs or outcroppings near water courses. Many are somewhat protected by being situated under overhangs. Preservation of the sites is usually good although some vandalism occurs at all of them. Often clusters of sites occur in favorable areas (Fig. 1). Designs found in Western Montana rock art can be grouped into four major categories: anthropomorphic figures, zoomorphic fig ures, tally marks, and geometric figures (Table 1). Anthropomorphic Figures Anthropomorphs are found at 22 of the 29 sites in Western Montana. Simple stick figures and a few outlined forms (Fig. 2) also 1</page><page sequence="2">B.C. v| ALBERTA WASH ^ MONTANA I-1-/Of^T 24LN530-J 24FH515 A X S \ 24LN510-J AA X jT j IDAHO \ Kv/ ORE( WYO / 24FH1008 1 -'-1 v 124FH1007 I KOOTENAI 24FH1009 ^""^ uswAnA iitah - RIVER 24FH1006 tTAa.

Previously this motif was thought not to exist in Western Montana (Arthur 1968:61), but the figures located at 24RA501 and 24RA506 are classic shield bearing warriors as described by Connor and Connor (1971:14). Elements often associated with shield figures, including a horned headdress (Fig. 3) and a staff projecting from behind the shield (Fig. 2a), are depicted. Zoomorphic Figures Zoomorphs are more numerous than anthropomorphs although they occur at slightly fewer sites. Generally zoomorphs are simple, solid-colored, block bodied forms or stick figures. Occasional outlined forms occur. Except in a few instances, little anatomical detail is portrayed. All figures represent quadrupeds, although at times strict side views show only two legs. Groups of figures, possibly representing herds, occur at three sites. Bison, deer, mountain sheep, 3</page><page sequence="4">C D Figure 2. Human figures. A, shield bearing warrior at 24RA501 (approximately 4 inches tall); B, 24FH1007 (approximately 11 inches tall); C, 24FH1007 (approxi mately 8 inches tall); and D, 24SA1022 (approximately 5 inches tall). horses, and a dog were identified. Bison are depicted at three sites. Five simple block bodied animals, each with a pronounced dorsal hump (Fig. 4d), are found at 24LA1026, and two more at 24LA1052 both sites at Flathead Lake (Fig. 1). Although horns are not portrayed, the hump is characteristic of rock art bison. In contrast, the two bison at 24FH1006, located on Ashley Creek northwest of Flathead Lake (Fig. 1), are anatomically much more elaborate (Fig. 5). Detailed anatomical features of these bison include horns, hump, ears, tail, tongue and hooves. One is portrayed in an inverted position. These bison (and a horse at the same site) are the most detailed zoomorphs found in the region. Although deer and elk are the most common large game animals in Western Montana, they were positively identified at only two sites. (Since representations of deer, elk, and even moose would be extremely similar if not identical, we use deer as a generic term.) One deer with poorly defined antlers was depicted at 24RA503 (Fig. 4a). The second occurrence of deer is a herd portrayed at 24SA1019 (Fig. 6). The posi tioning of the animals gives an extremely realistic impression of deer or elk travelling in a herd. Although none of these figures have antlers, it is unlikely that they are other than deer or elk, since deer and elk are the only herd animals common to the region. The single dog portrayal (Fig. 7) is part of a group of four figures at 24RA505 that we interpret as a hunting scene. The proportions of the animal and the position of its tail, along with its position relative to the other animal, and to the two human figures that it seems to be aiding in the hunt, suggest the identification. Two back-to-back figures at 24LA1021 are identified as mountain (Bighorn) sheep be cause of the characteristic shape of their horns (Fig. 4b). This characteristic horn shape identifies mountain sheep in rock art through out the western United States. Horses are depicted at two sites. A riderless horse with flowing mane and tail occurs on a panel with two elaborately detailed bison at 24FH1006. The horse is anatomically detailed, as are the bison, suggesting that the figures might be related. Another horse occurs at 24LA1021 (Fig. 4c). It is being ridden. A line connecting it with Figure 3. Shield bearing warriors at 24RA506. Larger figure is painted in red with right interior half of shield painted yellow. Smaller figure (note horned head dress) is entirely yellow. 4</page><page sequence="5">another anthropomorph suggests that the horse is being held or led. Although bears have been tentatively identified at 24LN510 (Taylor 1973:40), we question the identification. Unidentified figures at two different sites may represent abstract animals. One resem bles a turtle, another a bird, and a third figure may represent a lizard or insect. The majority of zoomorphs are unidenti fiable. The artists may have intended to represent individuals of many different spe cies, but the lack of anatomical detail precludes specific ^identification. Animals portrayed in an orthograde or inverted position rather than the normal pronograde position may represent animals that have been killed (Connor and Connor 1971:21,24). Animals portrayed in these "dead" positions include one of the two bison at 24FH1006 and unidentified animals at 24FH1007, 24LA1006, and 24LA1026. These "dead" animals may have been meant to serve as hunting magic or as a record of a successful hunt. A B C D Figure 4. Identifiable zoomorphs.

Note horns, ears, hooves, tail, hump and tongue (beard?). Tally Marks Tally marks?series of short, evenly spaced, vertical lines?are the most common pictographic motif in Western Montana rock art. They occur in series of two to more than twenty. Usually several series occur at a site. Occasionally a series is vertically oriented, with marks oriented horizontally and placed one above the other, much like rungs in a ladder. Although the tally marks vary greatly in length (1-8 inches), thickness (1/8-1% inches), and spacing, the marks in any particular series are almost always consistent in length and thickness, and the paint is usually spread evenly along the full length of the line. Tally marks have been interpreted vari ously as day counts, counts of people or animals, or as marks resulting from the artist cleaning his fingers or other paint applicator. If they do represent counts, the nature of the objects counted is speculative. Malouf (1961:9) has suggested that they record the number of days a supplicant spent at the site during his vision quest. Except in the few instances where the marks are poorly executed such as some of those at 24LN530 (Taylor 1973:71) and a few at 24FH1007, 24RA7, and 24RA518, tally marks were probably intentionally made. The regularity of the lines in most of the series of tally marks indicates that they were not the result of cleaning a paint applicator. Geometic Figures A large group of various designs is best classified as geometric (Table 1), not to imply stylistic or functional relationships, but rather to facilitate description. 5</page><page sequence="6">6 Inch? cot* Figure 6. Deer herd at 24SA1019. Head of figure at far lower left destroyed. Sunburst circles (Fig. 8) occur at five of the pictograph sites in the northern portion of Western Montana. These designs are inter preted as sun symbols. Simple circles found at the same sites as sunbursts, and at other sites, may also represent the sun. Circles with one or more long trailing lines occur at three sites. Those at 24LA1026 are extremely similar to the one at 24LA1023. A third, slightly different example occurs at 24FH1007. Ribbed figures (Fig. 9a) are found at two sites-24MO505 and 24SA1019. Small crosses occur at five sites. Else where, similar crosses have been interpreted as representations of stars or crossed trails (Connor and Connor 1971:31, Teit 1930:284). Horizontal and vertical zig-zag lines occur at three sites. Similar designs elsewhere have been intrepreted as snakes, but since none of Figure 7. Hunting scene at 24RA505. Note dog to right. Hunter approximately 10 inches tall. the lines in Western Montana has anything that might represent a head, no identification is hazarded. Series of dots, in various arrangements, are found at ten sites. Elsewhere dots have been intrepreted as tracks, celestial bodies or counts. Here, in three instances, dots are associated with anthropomorphs (Fig. 2d) in a relationship suggestive of a pictographic signature such as those reported by a Kutenai informant to Malouf and White (1953:31) and illustrated by Mallery (1972:442-460). Rake-like figures occur frequently in Western Montana pictographs. These are series of vertical lines connected at the top or bottom by a horizontal line. In some, both top and bottom lines are present. Some of these figures resemble tally marks with an added connecting line, but others, unlike tally mark series, ha^e vertical lines of several shapes. The short vertical lines of several rakes at 24FH1007 resemble anthropomorphs. Strik ingly similar figures in the Great Lakes region are interpreted as men in canoes (Dewdney and Kidd 1967). We believe that the figures at 24FH1007 may also represent canoes. Many site panels included abstract geo metric forms. Some are simple combinations of lines or lines and circles; a few are extremely complex (Fig. 9c). These are generally well-executed, apparently inten tional designs, with no two being alike. It is unlikely that these are merely "doodles" as has often been suggested. 6</page><page sequence="7">Pigments Red is by far the most frequently used color in Western Montana pictographs; it is the most common pigment at all of the 29 recorded sites. Yellow is found at four sites. Yellow figures include two anthropomorphs and part of another at 24RA506 (Fig. 3), part of an abstract figure at 24LA1023, and tally marks at two other sites. Black occurs at 24LN510 where it was used to paint an indistinct geometric form (Taylor 1973:40), and at 24LN1021 to paint an animal and tally marks. Only two polychrome figures?a red shield figure with a partially yellow shield at 24RA506 (Fig. 3) and a red and yellow abstract form at 24LN1023?occur in the region. Iron oxides, common throughout the region, are presumed to be the base for both red and yellow pigments. This has been verified for the red paint at 24LA1026 (Elrod 1&amp;08:6). Black pigment may have been made from charcoal. INTERPRETATIONS Two art styles divide Western Montana rock art geographically into northern and southern zones, each zone seemingly reflect ing a different cultural influence. Four of a group of eight southern zone sites located near the headwaters of the Bitterroot River (Fig. 1) are probably attri butable to Shoshoneans. The four sites are 24RA501 and 24RA506, which include classic shield bearing warriors; 24RA505, a hunting scene; and 24RA504, which includes an animal similar in style to those at 24RA505 (see Fig.7). Figure 8. Sunburst at 24FH1009. t7 Inch? A ^l^^ c 'Mir-' i10^ 1 Figure 9. Geometric figures. A, ribbed figure at 24MO505; B, abstract figure at 24LA1026; and C, abstract figure at 24SA1022. Based on the distribution and relative age of shield bearing warrior figures, it has been suggested that they are Shoshonean in origin (Malouf 1968:13; Keyser 1975). Since Sho shones are known to have inhabited the upper Bitterroot Valley (Turney-High 1941:14) and surrounding areas (Davis 1974; Keyser 1974; Steward 1943), the classic shield bearing warriors at 24RA501 and 24RA506 may well be Shoshonean in origin. The hunting scene at 24RA505 (Fig. 7), which shows a spear-throwing hunter, his quarry, and a hunting dog, also is probably Shoshonean. The tall, linear anthropomorphs at this site are very similar to those at 24RA506. From ethnographic evidence it is known that the Shoshone used dogs for hunting (Dominick 1964:153; Steward 1943: 294). Hunting scenes attributed to Shoshones (Swanson 1972:12) and similar to that at 24RA505 (even including dogs) are found in central Idaho less than 200 miles from 24RA505. Similar scenes apparently do not occur in other areas of the Plateau. 24RA504, located less than one mile from 24RA505, depicts a single animal that is stylistically very similar to the animal being hunted in the panel at 24RA505. Hence, it may also be Shoshonean. The four other sites in the upper Bitterroot Valley cannot be attributed to Shoshoneans. 7</page><page sequence="8">24RA503 is located in a small overhang, high on a steep rocky ridge. Because of the stylistic similarities between 24RA503 and the sites in the northern portion of Western Montana it is included with the 21 northern sites. The panel at 24RA502 comprised only a few indistinct markings. It was destroyed by road construc tion several years ago before it was adequate ly recorded. Sites 24RA7 and 24HA518 both comprise large numbers of tally marks, and little else. They show no definite resem blances to any of the other sites in Western Montana, but their floodplain location is similar to the nearby Shoshonean sites rather than the isolated locations of the northern zone sites. The pictographs of the northern portion of Western Montana, including 24RA503, show distinct differences from the sites in the Bitterroot Valley. Most of these sites are located in relatively inaccessible places. Some are high on cliff faces, some panels at Flathead Lake are accessible only by water (Fig. 10). Zoomorphs are more common than anthropomorphs at northern sites. (The reverse is true for the sites in the southern Bitterroot Valley.) Often zoomorphs and human figures are closely associated at northern sites. Many of the designs found at sites in the northern zone resemble designs found else where on the Columbia Plateau. For example, the bison at 24FH1006 are stylistically similar to bison at a site on the Columbia River in Washington (Anonymous 1938; Cain 1950:21) and on the lower Snake River in Idaho (Nesbitt 1968:Fig. 9). Bison are extremely uncommon in Plains rock art (Connor and Connor 1971) and are neither as well executed nor as anatomically detailed (Connor 1962:13). A horse, on the panel that includes the bison, dates 24FH1006 to the Historic Period. That the bison portrayal style at 24FH1006 represents influence from the Columbia Plateau is suggested by the fact that Plateau groups travelled from the Columbia River region through Western Montana to the Plains to hunt buffalo ?principally during the Historic Period (Griswold 1970:22). Quite possibly this accounts for the stylistic similarity of Columbia Plateau and 24FH1006 bison. The frequency of bison in Western Montana rock art is notable considering the relative scarcity of bison depictions in Montana plains rock art (Connor and Connor 1971:24). The occurrence of bison in Western Montana rock art may indicate their impor tance, coupled with the difficulty in obtaining them, since Western Montana and other plateau groups were forced to undertake dangerous journeys into enemy territory on the plains in order to procure bison in any significant number (Turney-High 1941:35). Sunbursts and simple circles are common throughout Columbia Plateau rock art (Cain 1950; Corner 1968; Cressman 1937) where they are often assumed to represent the sun. Simple circles are uncommon in Montana plains rock art (Connor and Connor 1971:33). Sunburst circles are apparently also un common; at least they are rarely mentioned. Both sunbursts and simple circles occur commonly in Western Montana pictographs. The deer herd at 24SA1019 is almost identical to a herd depicted in southeastern British Columbia (Corner 1968:89). The style of the individual animals and the manner in which the "herd effect" was potrayed differentiate these sites from any in sur rounding areas. Ribbed figures are found in Western Montana at 24SA1019 and 24MO505. Similar figures are widespread in Columbia Plateau rock art. They occur at several sites in southern British Columbia (Corner 1968: 37,51), in Washington /(Cain 1950), and Oregon (Cressman 1937). A few ribbed figures occur at sites in Central Montana just east of the Continental Divide (Shumate 1960:21) but these Sites are attributed to the Pend d' Oreille, a Plateau tribe that lived on the fringes of the plains (Malouf 1961:5,6). Elsewhere on the plains ribbed figures are apparently uncommon since they are rarely mentioned. Tally marks also suggest a relationship with the Columbia Plateau rather than with the Northwestern Plains. Tally marks are the most common design in Western Montana pictographs, occurring at 23 sites. Some sites have hundreds of marks. Sites in Idaho have similar quantities of tally marks (Erwin 1930:57,60,66) as do British Columbia sites (Corner 1968). Tally marks are notably uncommon on the Northwestern Plains (Connor and Connor 1971:34). A few other designs?zig-zag lines, ab 8</page><page sequence="9">Figure 10. 24LA1023, located on Little Bull Island in Flathead Lake. Arrow indicates location of pictograph panel. stract zoomorphs, and crosses?occur fre quently in both Plains and Plateau rock art. Although it is difficult to establish with certainty the function of Western Montana pictographs, several lines of evidence suggest that many of them are related to the vision questing practices of the Plateau tribes. Teit (1930:194,283) documents the use of pictography in the vision quest of the Columbia Plateau tribes. Among these groups, a person seeking power or a spirit helper would retire to a secluded place. Often this was done at puberty but some groups allowed it at any time during an individual's lifetime. Aferwards, to commemorate his experience, the successful vision seeker would often paint pictographs of his spirit helper and other objects encountered in his dreams. Sometimes the supplicant painted his pictographic signature (Malouf 1961:9). Among some groups exceptionally important dreams were also recorded pictographically (Teit 1930:194). For the Pend d'Oreille, Kutenai, Flathead and Couer D'Alene?the groups that inhab ited Western Montana?animals, humans, inanimate spirits and celestial bodies all served as guardian spirits. The sun was regarded as a powerful guardian. Often animal spirits took an anthropomorphic form, but the species identity of the animal was still known (Ray 1939:82). It seems likely that many of the picto graphs of Western Montana are records of vision quests or dreams. Pictograph sites occur in relatively inaccessible isolated areas similar to those chosen for vision quests. The predominant designs are a variety of human and animal representations, sun symbols, dots, crosses, and abstract designs, all of which were used to pictographically represent guardian spirits or objects encountered in dreams or visions.The intimate association of anthropomorphs with animals and abstract designs, observed at several sites, might represent the appearance of a guardian spirit in anthropomorphic form [(as is the case with pictographs on clothing (Teit 1930:79)], or a pictographic signature. Whatever the reason for their origin, pictograph sites were thought of as places of power (Malouf 1961:9, Malouf and White 1953:31). Hence, they may have been reused as vision quest sites. Because they were 9</page><page sequence="10">revered locations, offerings may have been left at them. (A similar practice occurred at medicine trees which were also thought to possess power [Weisel 1951]. Offerings at medicine trees include jewelry, artifacts, and flakes [Keyser and McLean 1974; Malouf, personal communication 1974].) One pictograph site included such artifact offerings. Bone beads, animal claws, and projectile points were recovered by collectors from the deposit on the narrow ledge below 24GN1001. A similar situation probably occurred at 24FH1005, where the deposit on the narrow ledge below the paintings has been extensively vandalized. We recovered small chert flakes from the vandals' backdirt. Western Montana pictographs may also be related to hunting. In Nevada petroglyphs often occur at game ambushes suggesting that they functioned as hunting magic (Heizer and Baumhoff 1962:225). 'There is no such direct relationship evident in Montana plains rock art (Connor and Connor 1971:29) or Western Montana rock art, although hunting scenes are portrayed in both. However, it is our opinion that animal figures at several sites may represent attempts to invoke hunting magic in order to control game animals. 24RA505 shows two men and a dog pursuing an unidentified animal (Fig. 7). The man is thrusting a spear at the quarry. This hunting scene may simply record an event or it may have been intended as hunting magic. Animals portrayed upside down or in a pronograde position occur at 24FH1006, 24FH1007, 24LA1006, and 24LA1026. These are intrepreted as dead animals and may reflect hunting magic or record successful hunts. Herds of animals at three sites? 24LA1026, 24LA1052, and 24SA1019-may also indicate a concern with hunting. It is a common misconception that rock art is simply "doodling". This is unlikely since designs are usually well-executed, and re gional styles can often be defined (Steward 1929:225). Often sites show a non-random pattern resulting from their function (Heizer and Baumhoff 1962:239). These reasons, coupled with the difficulty in gaining access to many Western Montana sites, make it unlikely that very many of the designs represent prehistoric "doodling". The age of Western Montana picto graphs cannot be determined with any certainty. Sites 24FH1006 and 24LA1021 include horses which date them to the Historic Period. No instance of super imposition occurs to suggest a relative chronology for the minor stylistic differences noted among designs at the other pictograph sites. That some sites could be at least several hundred years old is suggested by the minor weathering that has occurred at 24LA1026 during the last 70 years. Photographs of the site taken in 1974 are essentially indistinguish able from photographs taken in 1903 (Elrod 1908:Plates l-IX). Aside from modern van dalism only one figure?which may also have been vandalized?shows any appreciable weathering. Dr. Erling Karlsgodt, owner of Little Bull Island on which 24LA1023 is located, provided photographs that indicated that no apparent weathering has occurred at this site over the last twenty years. Had significant weathering occurred over these measured spans of time, it could be inferred that none of the pictographs were very old; but since weathering is apparently very slow, these sites could be several hundred years old. CONCLUSIONS Western Montana rock art is restricted to pictographs. The only petroglyph in the region is a fake (Kehoe 1960). The absence of petroglyphs is unexplained, since they occur in all adjacent areas, even on rock similar to that found in Western Montana. Traditionally Western Montana rock art has been interpreted as relating mainly with Plains rock art (Malouf 1956:50; Grant 1967:98) even though it was recognized that its probable function was related to Plateau vision questing practices (Malouf 1961:9). These hypothesized relationships were based on the incomplete description of a few sites in central Montana (Shumate 1960; Arthur 1960) and a limited familiarity with a selected few Western Montana sites. At these sites several types of pictographs were distinguished (Malouf 1961). His Type I pictographs are simple, realistically depicted, solid-colored figures found in Idaho, Western Montana and British Columbia and occasionally along the east flank of the Rocky Mountains in central Montana (Malouf 1961:1,5). Classic Type I 10</page><page sequence="11">pictographs comprise more than 90 percent of those found in Western Montana. Simple red paintings also occur in central Wyoming and connections between Montana and Wyoming were suggested (Malouf 1961:5). However, further study has shown that these are probably not linked to the Montana Type I paintings since a different style occurs in the intervening region of southcentral Montana where Type I paintings are rare (Connor 1962:6). Later Type II and III pictographs found at sites in central Montana but seldom in Western Montana, according to Malouf (1961:6), are highly abstract outlined forms of men and animals. These show affinities to rock art in southcentral Montana and Wyo ming. We believe that the rare outlined forms found in Western Montana are better thought of as variations of the Type I theme, since they resemble Type I pictographs in all other respects. Recently collected data from many more sites serve to separate even further the styles and designs of the Montana plains from those of central and Western Montana (Connor 1962; Connor and Connor 1971). Thus, it seems more likely that Western Montana pictographs are of Columbia Plateau derivation since the Type I style and the designs common to Western Montana rock art are similar to Columbia Plateau rock art styles rather than Northwestern Plains rock art styles. Sites in central Montana with Type I pictographs and designs similar to those in Western Montana may well be attributed to the Pend d'Oreille and Flathead who occupied the fringes of the plains prior to the Historic Period (Malouf 1961:5,6). Later styles ?Types II and III ?at the central Montana sites are Plains styles that failed to penetrate into Western Montana. Functionally, many of the sites in Western Montana reflect Plateau Salish vision quest ing. Hunting magic may have been a minor function of some sites. The sites attributed to Salishans occur (with the exception of 24RA503) in the northern portion of Western Montana, supporting Malouf's (1961:6) asser tion that many of them were painted by the Pend d'Oreille. A few sites, located in the southern portion of Western Montana near the headwaters of the Bitterroot River, more closely resemble rock art found in southcentral Idaho, and are probably of Shoshonean origin. These sites include shield bearing warriors and a hunting scene. Their floodplain location differs from the relatively inaccessible locations of the Salishan vision quest sites. Their style and the ratio of human to animal figures depicted also differ from the sites attributed to Salishans. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors wish to express their gratitude to Dr. Carling I. Malouf, Bob Van Derhoff and Mae Vallance who gave information concerning site locations, Dr. Erling Karlsgodt who provided old photographs of 24LA1023, Phillip L. Maxwell who loaned us a boat thereby enabling us to examine the sites at Flathead Lake, and Dr. Floyd W. Sharrock and Dr. C. Melvin Aikens who read the manuscript and provided constructive criticism.
