<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Untraditional Serves Tradition Richard Grigg, When God Becomes Goddess: The Transformation of American Religion. New York: Continuum, 1995. 155pp. $22.95 (cloth). Richard Grigg makes the bold, yet not unfamiliar, claim that feminist theology is the most viable alternative for the revitalization — indeed, the survival — of Western religion in North America. He is convinced that fem inist theology is able to confront the impossibility of theodicy in contemporary religious thought more successfully than traditional forms of piety. Many feminist theologians have rejected the notion of an omnipotent God as pernicious and actively damaging to women; Grigg, too, finds this traditional theistic view of God as transcendent and omnipotent personal agent to be rad ically incoherent. The pathos Grigg points to is that this incoherent God is not only the God of the atheist, but the God of the theist; God is not dead, but He is largely irrelevant. God can no longer intelligibly be employed as the force behind events that lie outside the private, personal sphere; our scientific world view makes this view of God untenable. Yet a God restricted to the private sphere is no longer transcendent; is, in fact, no longer God. The impossibil ity of theodicy in the twentieth century renders this notion of God even more problematic: the advent of mass techniques of death, coupled with advanced medical technologies, leaves God no viable role in either preserving life or ex plaining death. "The crucial point is not that the contemporary form of the problem of theodicy makes belief in traditional theism's God impossible," con cludes Grigg, "but that it radically alters the use and thus the meaning of that belief" (37). The seeming continuity in the repetition of traditional formulae about God masks a radical change in meaning; feminist theology's seeming departures from tradition, on the other hand, actually manifest real continuity with the traditional meaning of God. In order to preserve the essential core of the notion of God as transcen dent source of life and meaning, Grigg argues, it is necessary to abandon the notion of God as personal agent. The transformation from God to God dess performed by feminist theology is just such a transformation; it proceeds from the assumption that "God is a relation that human beings choose to en act" (51-52). Grigg finds this redefinition of deity enacted by mainly white, middle-class, Euro-American theologians such as Ruether, Christ, Plaskow, Daly, and Schüssler Fiorenza, and claims that it holds sway across ideological and theoretical boundaries among feminists. The Goddess of what he therefore characterizes as "enactment theology" is not a self-originating deity, yet she is a transcendent one, in that she only lives and moves and has her being in and among right relations enacted among human beings and nature. This radically immanent Goddess remains transcendent in that the relation enacted always surpasses the individuals enacting it; like Buber's I-Thou relation, Goddess is more than the sum of her parts. She is not "merely" human; the inclusion of 560 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="2">the natural world and the "power of being" in right relation protects against a fall into anthropomorphic idolatry. The achievement of enactment theology and its concept of Goddess, then, lies in its ability to "preserve those essential elements of the notion of God that traditional theism no longer can" (67). Goddess is precisely not a privatized deity; she is embodied in history. She reclaims nature and the body for the sacred; even the traditional "otherness" of deity is preserved (in transformed fashion) by the respect she fosters for the concrete otherness found in other persons and in nature. Devotion to this Goddess is a historical and practical relation, not a noetic state of belief. Grigg finds that enactment piety entails more than just an intellectual or philosophical transformation of religion, yet his argument turns on the Tillichian definition of religion as being a matter of "ultimate concern." He claims that enactment piety possesses the ability to assuage the "anxieties" that traditional religious formulations have been understood to address: anxieties about fate and death, about whether we are living our lives rightly, and about meaninglessness. It does so partly through a new understanding of the self. Grigg notes that acceptance of a Goddess who is not "out there" but is instead precisely here among us also entails acceptance of the fragmented and shifting nature of the self and a concomitant acceptance of limitation and imperfection. Goddess cannot guarantee our "identity" in the way that the traditional God seemed to, cannot promise everlasting life for individual consciousness. Rather, enactment piety replaces a traditional religious understanding of human nature as having its telos in a Creator, with a new understanding of the "self" as found in its right relation to the world. Relation to the divine is seen in the form of resistance to oppression; ethics becomes not a matter of plumbing what already exists in one's ontological makeup, but of engaging in the very relations that create Goddess. Grigg is well aware of the fragility and vulnerability of enactment piety; the individuals and communities that support it are far from institutionalized. To fulfill its hopes of inspiring material as well as formal transformation in the world, he argues, it needs to be connected to social bases from which to act. Yet Grigg overlooks, perhaps, the extent to which feminist piety is indeed already interconnected with "secular" communities. In defending enactment piety as a truly "religious" phenomenon, he seems to draw closer the very boundaries which feminist theology seeks to complicate and expand. While he recognizes that feminist theology entails both real changes and real con tinuities in traditional piety, and judges its future attractiveness and viability mainly on the grounds of the continuities, he invites speculation that when a transformation in religion takes place, it transforms not only the answers (to questions about the "anxieties of being," for example) but the questions them selves. When God Becomes Goddess can be read as a work in transition between the modern question of how belief in God is possible, and the questions posed by feminist liberation theologians about the kind of God Christians proclaim, WINTER 1996/97 561</page><page sequence="3">and whether, in Schüssler Fiorenza's words, "religious faith and community make a difference in the struggle for the well-being of all." Grigg's analysis of the vitality and importance of the feminist reconstruc tion of divinity is timely and useful, yet ultimately not quite satisfying, perhaps because of his, and his feminist sources', continued reliance on mod ern categories — such as "religion" itself — that do not always do justice to the liberation concerns of feminist theology. Recognizing that the privatiza tion of religion was mainly a modern development, Grigg fails to take into account the accompanying realization that "religion" is in fact a modern in vention, and that to invoke it is to also invoke all the modern baggage, such as public/private dualism, that comes with it — a move that works against the very important argument he constructs about feminist theology's ability to "de-privatize" God/dess. Enactment theology's reconstruction of divinity has implications for the rethinking of redemption beyond the embracing of finitude and the allaying of "anxiety," and while Grigg demonstrates a pro foundly sympathetic awareness of the liberation concerns of feminist theology, his account of its transformative possibilities might be fruitfully extended by a consideration of other liberation theologies, especially womanist, mujerista, and Asian. When God Becomes Goddess is at once a powerful rebuttal to traditionalists who see only heresy and blasphemy in the reformulations and radical new di rections of feminist theology (think of the many responses from mainstream Christianity to the "Relmagining Conference"), and a heartfelt, though not completely successful, attempt to speak for the continuing meaning of Chris tian belief in a secular context. The book's greatest value lies in its constructive picture of the deity of feminist theology(ies), which suggests that "tradition" is in fact better served by feminist theology than by contemporary recapitula tions of traditional concepts. This continuity is expressed in not only functional but substantive terms. "Different deities, its seems, demand different kinds of piety" (81); the implications to be drawn from this comparison of "God" to "Goddess" stretch far beyond the boundaries of this short work.
