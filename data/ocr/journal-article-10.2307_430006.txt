<plain_text><page sequence="1">Editorial AND ART CRITICISM .... study, research, discussion, and publication in aesthetics .... to include all studies of the arts and related types of experience from a philo- sophic, scientific, or other theoretical standpoint.... visual arts, literature, music and theater arts. The above phrases come from the outside cover of this journal and its reverse. They seem all-inclusive, and in a sense they are -and they represent what one aesthetician has thought of as the unprofessional aspect of aesthetic writing. At the same time they represent that aspect of the Society's and the Journal's work which says something to a large number of people for whom "profes- sional" aesthetics in its more restricted sense is almost meaningless-and if not meaningless, at least trivial. This opinion may seem odd because literary people, at least, have always been free with the pen, have always aimed at devising an aesthet- ics-related literary criticism, and in the last several decades have almost created a vo- cabulary of their own-so much so that simplicity and directness of observation have been replaced by a certain arcane cast of speculation not surpassed in its obscurity and in its labyrinthine ways even in the writings of German metaphysicians. Still, there are many people, and often highly in- telligent ones, who can take or leave aes- thetics and who say about philosophy in general and about aesthetics in particular that-as was once said to me-"That is the road to folly; it is a dead end; it gets no- where." Even certain not-too-searching questions about the nature of the novel, let us say, and about certain works like James Joyce's Ulysses, for example, represent to The editorial in this issue is from the desk of Herbert M. Schueller, President of the American Society for Aesthetics. them that well-publicized dreariness of aes- thetics, and also almost symbolize a waste of time. To prefer Tom Jones to Ulysses, however, is already to make a judgment or many judgments, and to theorize about the nature of literary or any other judgment is surely an understandable possibility, though to desire not to approve of specu- lation about the technical and theoretical differences between the two novels seems not. This is not to say that people who find aesthetic questions intolerable are unable to distinguish between the novel and the poem. To them the difference is real, ob- vious, and patent and needs no theoretical justification. Yet even to classify similari- ties and differences is to try to understand what is going on, and to understand what is going on is part of intelligent and rational existence. (To ask why something is going on is just as rational, but different because usually the result is sheer speculation.) To ask what a modern tragedy is, how it differs from its ancient counterpart, to what ex- tent re-definition is necessary if the term modern tragedy is not to be a contradic- tion in terms, how such a term can be ap- plied to, let us say, Lessing's Miss Sara Sampson, why Lessing's play was such a shocker in its time: these are questions with aesthetic implications in both the broad and the narrow senses and call for answers in aesthetic terms neither meaningless nor irrelevant to criticism, thought, art, or cul- ture. Why was Benjamin West's The Death of General Wolfe a scandal in its day and</page><page sequence="2">EDITORIAL why, after gazing at it for some time, did Sir Joshua Reynolds declare it to be good de- spite the institutional conventions the eighteenth century had imposed on it and all other historical paintings? How does the Hofmannsthal-Strauss Electra differ from Sophacles'? Why did seventeenth-century Englishmen think they had to "correct" Shakespeare? What is the reason for the present fashionableness of Baroque music, and how do the characteristics of this music compare with those of Baroque painting or architecture? These questions call for aes- thetic analyses of works against environ- mental, cultural, and therefore historical backgrounds, and require the attention of the historian, the art-critic, and the music critic, who are asked to have some ac- quaintance with theoretical aesthetics and the multitude of questions it has already asked. There are basic theoretical considera- tions about which artists themselves could presumably write. And, indeed, one may ask, should non-professionals in art write about art from the point of view of criti- cism or aesthetics at all? "Most writing about art," said Delacroix, "is by people who are not artists; thus all the miscon- ceptions." That the practicing artist is the best judge of work in his medium is an opinion as old as Aristotle, or at least as old as Cicero, Pliny, and Quintilian; it has asserted itself repeatedly-only, of course, to be denied in practice and action. If crea- tive artists alone had written criticism and aesthetics, and philosophers had held themselves aloof, the history of aesthetics, even though artists' opinions have a value in themselves, would be poor indeed. With few exceptions, artists are notoriously one- sided and not always capable of judging either their own or others' works with im- partiality; the expression of mere preju- dice is not scientific either in politics or in art. And, no matter how much the artist may overwhelm them, even students do not hold to the view that the artist is the best judge of art as a whole and that the aesthe- tician does not know what he is talking about. In wanting to learn about art and judgment they seem to assume that the aesthetician need not be a professional writer in the usually accepted sense of that term, or a composer, a sculptor, or a chore- ographer. Students want answers: they want us to tell them why this is better than that, and why something is good in any case. Why is Milton better than Pope-if he is; Michelangelo than Copley; Ibsen than Noel Coward; Beethoven than John Cage (if they indeed are comparable)? What is a good artist? They want to know what good music is (a phrase, by the way, I find more and more cavalierly used in "professional" writing about aesthetics). Like us, students want certainty; like the ancients, they want permanent laws or nomoi; and like us, they discover that the unambiguous answer is hard to find: unfortunately, we cannot give it to them because we cannot give it to one another. And thus the constant striving for concreteness in our philosophical, his- torical, scientific, and theoretical pursuits. The best we can say is that on the basis of this or that assumption, this work is good or bad, good and bad meaning this and that, because the work has these and those phe- nomenal characteristics. The inclusiveness of the phrases I quoted above therefore explain why this Journal has always been noted for the variety of its approaches and-even more-why termi- nological, ontological, and logical analyses must be supplemented by aesthetic analy- sis of works on a comparative basis and by the art criticism which supplies a step be- tween the work and aesthetic principle "su- perior" to it. Here we are hampered in part by the tyranny of the masterpiece. As we teach and write, we describe circles. We treat only the "greatest" and "best" works (except for the few we casually name as metaphorical whipping-posts), and then in circular fashion show why the great are great. Our comparisons are not sharp enough. Masterpieces are difficult to com- pare, and such comparison is frequently unfruitful. We hesitate to employ the third-, fourth-, and fifth-rate. Some years ago when I was teaching the principles of tragedy according to Aristotle, a subject which always seems to compel attention, a student asked me if I did not think that the mother in Gene Statton Porter's The Girl of the Limberlost was a tragic figure. 244</page><page sequence="3">Editorial Because the students, I was sure, did not know the novel, or at least would not admit to knowing it-so much does snobbishness enter into our academic work-I failed to "use" what the student said, turned dis- cussion into different paths, and missed the opportunity of asking for a comparison of this figure with Jocasta, for example, or Medea. Both of these figures would of course have come out on top, as it were, and the students would have been able to demonstrate, as they did later when I had mended my ways, that they were equally as perceptive as I thought I was, though of course they did not have the currently proper vocabulary. (Later I discovered that through the comparison of masterpieces with lesser works students easily came to the same conclusions as reputable scholars who did have the vocabulary.) Surely aes- thetic principles can be consciously applied to any work of the appropriate genre, and one need never fear that Stella Dallas will be held to be superior to Anna Karenina, except, possibly, in Pickwickian terms. Trash has its aesthetic qualities too-wit- ness the popularity among intellectuals of the murder mystery and science fiction- though it may merely point up to the supe- rior qualities of the masterpiece. The em- pirical method, even as loosely used as I have described it here, may result in con- clusions-and articles-in value far beyond those about masterpieces in which aes- thetic principles are embodied and ready to be discovered. I have been referring to literature, the easiest of the arts to use for examples ap- plicable in teaching or writing in aesthet- ics, in this Journal or in any other. The visual arts are second in line in this re- spect, though monetary considerations limit the number of illustrations which can be employed. But at least two of the arts-music and the dance-are at a great disadvantage in aesthetic discourse be- cause they are arts of motion. The visual and literary arts, with exception of the special cases of sculpture moving within a restricted space, and of the art of the thea- ter in some of its aspects, stand still and lend themselves to summary, quotation, de- scription, and close analysis. (Sculpture and architecture are at a disadvantage be- cause their aesthetic wholes are made up of parts perceived and mentally "brought to- gether" as one walks around them.) The visual and literary arts are physically more "handleable" than music and dance. The printing of musical examples is cumber- some and costly, and this is why, I should guess, much writing about music from the aesthetic point of view often seems to ac- complish in words what a good student can perceive in music as crystallized and re- corded on paper or "realized" on records. The very notation of music, the printing of which requires a process of its own, stands in the way. Dance is even in a worse posi- tion: it has almost no notation which is in- telligible to the reader who normally reads writings in aesthetics-and there are no easily transportable recordings. For any reader other than the critic or aesthetician who was himself present at performances he is writing about, there is little to be di- rectly observed. The musical scholar and dance critic are in the almost impossible situation of having to communicate their re- spective arts in an almost totally alien language. Of the three arts-poetry, music, and dance-which were a Gesamtkunst called the triune choria in ancient times, only poetry lends itself easily to pub- lished aesthetic analysis, although all were thought to be governed by, to represent, and almost to be a harmony; after 3000 years in their later metamorphoses, in opera for example, they are still diffi- cult and awkward to treat and are still of course a challenge to the writer of cour- age. But the very history of aesthetics itself is neither complete nor accurate in the ab- sence of research about the arts, their history, and the history of the theories con- nected with them. Take, for instance, the common notion that, roughly speaking, the dominant theories in aesthetics have been those of imitation and of expression ap- pearing in that order in time. The pub- lished evidence is great, but the facts say it is not so. True, there are ages in which each predominates, but if one accepts the fact that theories can be latent, unex- pressed assumptions, then the two have 245</page><page sequence="4">EDITORIAL been intertwined from the beginning of western art, and the theory of art as emo- tional expression and effect came first. Homer was not a theorist but an artist- assuming, that is, that he was one per- son-and, to give only one example, when he says that the blind bard Demodocus in the Odyssey sang about the conflicts between Odysseus and Achilles at the gates of Troy and, inspired by Apollo, did this so feelingly that the audience was delighted and Odysseus himself was both moved to tears and transported-then he is declaring that art, and here "song," has an overwhelming emotional power. Mere literary analysis will not show that a theory of therapeutic and moral effects existed from the very beginnings of art. Only the history of theory will establish that the first clearly aesthetic theory was probably cosmological, an assumption of the Pythagoreans that the universe is a harmonious whole (made up, indeed, of various "opposites," which opposites de- pending on the philosopher involved), a synthesis and a totality. Furthermore, number was its basic category. Even Plato saw number as coextensive with being, and it surely must have been coextensive also with the forms, which were the "models" for imitation. In the Cratylus Plato says that the body through imita- tion can express the nature of things and that the expressions of voice, tongue, or mouth are simply imitations of what we want to express. Now, all things have sound and figure and many have color, and these are best imitated by music (poetry-and-music-and possibly-dance) and drawing, and in the Laws Plato clearly implies that there are two imitations, that of beautiful harmonies and rhythms in music and dance and that of words in poetry. Order (form) itself is beautiful and it delights a good man apart from what- ever moral uplift he may receive from the words. And in the Republic Plato seems to be saying that inferior art is imitative of appearances only whereas superior art imitates the universal qualities of order, rhythm, harmony, and so forth. Is he distinguishing "realistic" from "idealistic" art? Is the distinction itself a "universal" one? At any rate, may I say that imita- tion seems a criterion for production of works and not an aesthetic criterion at all? This is no place to argue the fine points, but it is true that the Aristotelian dis- cussion of tragic imitation is often thought to be the first ever-and this because of our predominantly literary education- though most persons forget Plato's opinions and Aristotle's emphasis on the many kinds of imitation, including "the music of the flute and of the lyre in most of their forms," in which harmony and rhythm alone are employed. I wonder how many teachers recognize the Pythagorean- cosmological significance of this har- mony and in it see the basic principle for Aristotle's anthropomorphic adjust- ment to the cosmological theory, an adjust- ment according to which the physical world was an imitation of "numbers," and the human world a further imitation aiming at the achievement in men of the same balance of "opposites," but now mental, physical, and emotional, which was the core of the universe itself. Instead, there usually is concentration, as of course there must be, on the outer elements of tragedy like the characters qnd the action with its beginning, middle, and end. What is more, Aristotle was working in the tradi- tion of a rule-governed aesthetic whereby it was supposed that the State has a right to impose the rules which art must ob- serve. Of course, Aristotle was much less conservative in this respect than Plato, but even so the idea is in part assumed by his very endeavor scientifically to de- termine the rules proper to tragedy-rules which, one supposes, Aristotle would have changed if circumstances had deemed change appropriate. Thus the Poetics is a combination of understood criteria which have aesthetic relevancy; and in addi- tion to those combining state and law, there are a theory of expression, that of the subordination of character to action, the well-known one (possibly therapeutic) of catharsis, and, above everything, the over-arching principle of harmony and order which, taking first place, penetrates artistic things as it does-or should- 246</page><page sequence="5">Editorial every part of the human body and soul and as it does every part of the universe itself. In part the Poetics is its context. All studies in aesthetics which concern themselves more than superficially with the arts-less than superficially is the rule today-and all studies in the arts which concern themselves more than su- perficially with aesthetics are hampered by a certain inter- and intra-professional war- fare. Studio artists and art historians nourish a mutual suspicion which is the amazement of the outsider who would not be either artist or historian, and cer- tainly could not see himself as a com- bination of both, which is a rare oc- currence, indeed. Musical scholars are of course the bane of "practical" musicians, especially if the scholars profess to be critics. And musicologists, devoted (as they think) to a science, pooh-pooh the efforts of aestheticians, whom they think of as taking the easy road through vague and quite pleasant fields of irrelevant and useless conjecture. The aesthetician can be warned not to tread on the musicol- ogist's territory, because among profes- sional men it seems a thing unforgiveable if one crosses disciplines, as not only writ- ing scholars, but also teachers of courses labelled "Humanities" well know. English departments have always been the great- est sinners in these respects: I mean that they have taught various literatures in translation. And of course aesthetics pro- fessors are notorious for supposedly being presumptuous in going beyond their fields of competence. The result is that there still do not exist certain studies which a journal like this according to its own aims is proposed to encourage. Histories of (visual) art aesthetics and criticism hardly exist, histories of dance aesthetics and criti- cisms do not exist at all, and those of music aesthetics and criticism exist only in one or two languages. What is the basis for competence in these fields? First of all, the capacity for grasping the phenomenological aspects of the work of art; it is the ability to hear and see what is before one. This is not as universal an ability as might be supposed. Perception at first is therefore everything. Then comes a grasp of philosophical aesthetics. All students of research in the arts, includ- ing those of "related types of experi- ence from philosophic, scientific, or other theoretical standpoints," should be able to write essays in analysis of works of art; and then from this point onward, any further approaches-psychological, soci- ological, or historical-do indeed rest on their proper foundations and do indeed become a part of the history of the life of the senses and of the mind.
