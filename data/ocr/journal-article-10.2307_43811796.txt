<plain_text><page sequence="1">METAPHYSICS WITHOUT ONTOLOGY1 The above title outlines Professor Collingwood's project for the reinstatement of metaphysics in answer to Kant's question, ' How can metaphysics become scientific? ' Since metaphysics has hitherto been a mistake albout metaphy- sics, it was time something should be done albout it. In the books called Metaphysical (ra fiera ra &lt;f&gt;vou&lt;á = the next after the physics = much the same kind of title as ' Collected Works,' vol. viii), says Professor Collingwood, Aristotle undertakes two tasks. The first is the study (First Science) of the presuppositions of the ordinary non-meta- physical sciences; the second is the construction of a science (ontology) of pure being, and therefore (natural theology) of God. As first science metaphysics is logically presup- posed iby all the other sciences, although from the learner's point of view it is approached only when the other sciences have been to some degree mastered. As last science (wis- 1 An Essay on Metaphysics. By R. J. Collingwood. (Oxford; 18s.)</page><page sequence="2">39 O BLACKFRIARS dom) it will be the ultimate goal of the scientist's pil- grimage, and the most explicit name for it will be theology. The first chapter of Professor Collingwooďs book is a condensed paraphrase of Aristotle's Metaphysics. The second separates the two tasks mentioned above and argues, in continuity with Berkeley, Kant, and Hegel, that a science of ' pure being ' is a contradiction in terms. The grounds of this conclusion are already visible in the paraphrase of Aristotle in his first chapter (p. 9). Speaking of the system of the subordination of the sciences, he says: 'At the base of the system of universais there are universais which are infimae species, not giving rise to any further sub-species. At iits top there are universais which are summa genera , not species of any higher genus. Or rather, strictly speaking, there is only one summum genus . The ten ' categories ' recognized by logic are the ten species of the genus being; they are the yevrj rœv ovrœv, the forms into which being is specified. Thus there is only one pyramid of universais, and at its peak the universal of being.' The effect of these words from the phrase ' Or rather, strictly speaking ' to the end is to sweep aside all the delicate and vitally important discussion which has centred on this point in St. Thomas, Cajetan, John of St. Thomas, Suarez, Garrigou-Lagrange, Penido, and indeed almost every scho- lastic writer of rank from the thirteenth to the twentieth century. Apparently Professor Collingwood has not even seen that a problem exists, or that his interpretation of Aristotle on this point could be questioned. The result of regarding being as the summum genus logically and univoce presupposed in all subordinate uni- versais is (a) to reduce being to a spurious logical concept, and ( b ) to empty it of meaning. In scholastic terminology ' being ' is not a universal but a transcendental, and there is a world of difference between these two terms. Aristotle does not himself draw the conclusion that the pinnacle of the pyramid of the sciences includes the ultimate genera in the same way that a universal includes its subordinate</page><page sequence="3">METAPHYSICS WITHOUT ONTOLOGY 39 1 species. At least five loci may be cited3 in which St. Thomas, as an Aristotelian, makes clear the impossibility of such a conception. Neither is it enough to say, as Pro- fessor Collingwood does, that Aristotle was aware of diffi- culties and so left the question open as an inclusion with a difference. For this difference cannot be that ' being ' (the limiting case of the abstractive process) has abstracted to the degree of taking everything out and so left nothing for science to investigate. ' Pure being ' in that sense is a fiction without foundation in reality, and it is small wonder that Professor Collingwood cannot distinguish it ' from anything at all or from nothing/ Neither can ' being ' in the sense of the logical nexus in a proposition be treated as the summum genus , for being, in this sense, merely answers the question whether a thing is so or not, as a tick or a cross «marks a child's exercise book. Its function is purely logical, though its truth or falsehood is measured by reality. It remains that being, as meaning the actual existence of things, is one concept not as a universal concept is one, but with an analogical unity; a unity of proportion hold- ing together, under one concept and in the participation of one reality, what is diversified not by superadded differ- ences (which can be transcended by abstraction), but by intrinsic diversity of existence. In saying that ' being/ in the sense he gives to the single summum genus , means nothing at all, it is well to insist, then, that Professor Collingwood is speaking of nothing at all, and that such a statement leaves Aristotle and scholas- tic ontology untouched. We are reminded of the man- servant in Surtees' novel, who, opening the cupboard in mistake for the window shutters, pronounced the morning was dark and smelt of cheese. 3 St. Thomas Comm. in Metaph. Lib. I, lect. 9, 139; Lib. 3, lect. 8, 433; Lib. 5, lect. 9, 889; Lib. 10, lect. 3, 1966; Lib. 11, lect. i, 2169.</page><page sequence="4">39* BLÀCKFRIÀRS It should be noted that ' being ' in the sense in which we answer yes or no to whether a thing is (the logical copula) has its validity in the mind joining together by means of it the elements into which it has analysed its ex- perience. ' Being ' in this sense is not the being by which things exist, and precisely as a concept of being it is not convertible with reality - for the obvious reason that it is not, properly speaking, a concept of being at all, but a link by which concepts are joined in judgment. Nevertheless, it is derived from reality in this sense that by means of it we join in judgment elements which in reality are found united, and we must appeal to reality to verify the propo- sitions we form by means of it. Its function is to join to- gether parts of a logical whole. It is a mental instrument and that is its mental work. Insofar as the world of our experience is a unity which can be analysed &lt;by the mind into component and inter-related parts, 4 being ' in this sense, as the logical copula, has work to do in composing what the mind has divided and in affirming relations which, though founded in reality, may, in fact, be only logical relations. Such logical relations are those of genus to its subordinate species, of a higher universal to the sub- ordinate universais logically included in it, in the way, e.g., in which the universal ' animal ' is included in the higher universal 4 bodily substance.' But again insofar as the world of our experience is a logical unity it rests upon presuppositions which are them- selves incapable of being further analysed; and the rela- tive presuppositions of any particular science again pre- suppose certain absolute presuppositions without which science as governed by laws of thought is impossible. When Professor Collingwood, as the result of rejecting the second of Aristotle's great tasks in the Metaphysics , i.e., the science of ibeing or ontology, defines metaphysics according to the first as the science of absolute presuppositions, it is evident not only that metaphysics has been flatly equated with logic, but also that the first tasķ has been misconceived.</page><page sequence="5">METAPHYSICS WITHOUT ONTOLOGY 395 For it must either be a spurious logic or find its support elsewhere. For Aristotle, at any rate, since laws of thought are founded in laws of being, both the logical work which com- prises a certain proportion of the Metaphysics and even that which is done in the logical books themselves arę un- intelligible save by at least ultimate reference to being and the laws of being. And ' being ' as presupposed in the sciences subordinate to wisdom is the being by which things exist. It is not the being of the logical nexus. So the logical subordination of sciences by virtue of the de- grees of abstraction has its validity from the depth to which the mind, by the degree of abstraction proper to each science, penetrates the real existence of things. By refusing to consider ontologically the absolute pre- suppositions of science, Professor Collingwood therefore rules out the question of their truth. It is, he says, a nonsense question. But if the question of their truth can- not arise, neither (and this amounts to the same thing) can the question of their foundation in reality and in ex- istence arise. That also is a nonsense question. For the conception of their truth hę substitutes that of their logical efficacy (the fact that, not being answers to any possible question that is not a nonsense question, they cause questions to arise), and for their ultimate foundation in being or reality he substitutes the fact of their being presupposed. (' The logical efficacy of a supposition does not depend on the truth of what is supposed, or even on its being thought true, but only on its being supposed.') Hence the conclusion, 4 Metaphysics is about a certain class of historical facts, namely absolute presuppositions/ The needed reform of metaphysics is that it should be aware of itself as an historical science. So aware of itself it ' will be systematic in the sense in which all historical thought is systematic and no other/ There is a certain inevitability in this. If in fact we havr mistaken the cupboard for the window we are at least</page><page sequence="6">594 BLACKFRIARS behaving consistently in presenting a slice of Stilton as a summer morning. In this way, metaphysics becomes a specialised department of the science of history. It is gracefully and neatly done. The logical positivists against whom this passage of arms is undertaken may well concede that a chair in metaphysical philosophy may even yet be to the good of science. Those, however, who have been brought up in a tradition which sees the point in what Aristotle did not say about being may simply point to the way in which Professor Collingwood bridges Aris- totle's silence with a sentence commencing ' Or rather, strictly speaking, . . . .' as the key to what happens in the rest of the book's three hundred and fifty pages. Cajetan remarks, with what may well look like arro- gance, but is in fact a simple insistence on truth, that with- out knowledge of analogy no one may begin to learn meta- physics. Some awareness of this principle would have modified a rather naïve attack on the principle of causality on grounds of its anthropomorphic origins which occupies a later section of the book. The conclusiveness of the chap- ters in question is comparable to that of Freudian psycho- logy against the existence of God. Bernard Kelly.</page></plain_text>
