Sjjcologjj anb §ihlial Criticism. BUSHNELL (H.)—GOD IN CHRIST: Three Dis¬ courses delivered at New Haven, Cambridge, and Andover. With a Preliminary Dissertation on Language. By Horace Bushnell. Post 8vo, cloth, 6s. The Theory of Language illustrated in the Preliminary Dissertation is, that the bases or types of all -words or forms of speech for the expression of spiritual ideas are to be found in the objects and operations of the physical w orld (an ar¬ rangement which implies an intelligent pre-adapting mind) ; and that as these types are fixed, while mind and thought are ever growing, they can furnish only an imperfect and temporary medium for the representation of ideas, and must, therefore, give place to new forms, which the ideas themselves will necessarily and spontaneously create. These views the Author applies to a solution of the many vexed questions of dogmatic Theology. Creeds are under the same conditions as Language in general, and, as human and materialistic efforts to express the Divine, are in their nature equally imperfect and temporary. The Three Discourses on "The Divinity of Christ"— "The Atonement"—and on "Dogma and Spirit," are in¬ cluded under a common title—"God in Christ"; and the Author's principles find their appHcation in exhibiting the grand Dramas of Creation and E-edemption as Revelations— imperfect and progressive—of the Absolute Mind, and in showing how contradictions insuperable by human under¬ standing are inevitably involved in every attempt to bring down the infinite into the finite, and to blend the divine with</page><page sequence="8">&amp; MR. CHAPMAN S PUBLICATIONS. the human.—The Trinity set forth in the first Discourse is a threefold condition of God's self-revelation to the universe. The true and absolute Deity—the Power which is the ground and vital energy of Nature—is declared to be incommuni¬ cable, the revelations of Pather, Son, and Holy Spirit dis¬ closing only certain aspects of his Infinitude. The second Discourse considers the atonement and the Scripture expressions relating to it as having a twofold sense, viz., the Subjective and the Objective. In the former sense, it is the deliverance of man from the moral enthral- ment and defilement of sin through the new moral power brought into the world by Christ. This is effected by an objective representation of Divine Love—by the dramatizing of the Divine relations and feelings towards man in the In¬ carnation, Life, and Death of Christ, the Divine Man,—an historic scene which acts morally and aesthetically upon the heart. The point which he has elaborated with most care in this objective view of the Atonement, is the notion that a series of physical types had been instituted from the begin¬ ning of the world to create a phraseology capable of adapta¬ tion to the death of Christ. In the Discourse on Dogma and Spirit, he sets forth the hope of a new religious era, to be produced by a general dis¬ placement of dogma, and the restoration of the church to the simple, life-giving spirit of the Apostolic Age; exhibits the distinction between Dogma and Spirit, or Science and Paith, with the province and uses of Christian Theology; and then, to fill out the true theoretic conception of the subject, in¬ quires into the causes under which the church lapsed into Dogma, and the advantages she will have gained when she emerges from it. FOXTON (P.)—POPULAR CHRISTIANITY: Its Transition State and probable Development. By Frederick Foxton, A.B., formerly of Pembroke College, Oxford, and Perpetual Curate of Stoke Prior and Docklow, Plerefordshire. Post 8vo, cloth, 6s. The author of this work is one of several clergymen who have renounced an advantageous position in the Establish-</page><page sequence="9">"POPULAR CHRISTIANITY. 6 ment, on the ground of their renunciation, not merely of its specific doctrines and formularies, but of dogmatic Christi¬ anity in general. In the first chapter the writer sketches the condition of the Churches—the want of cohesion in the Established Church, which is equally compromised by the laxity of Evangelicalism, and the stringency of the Anglicans; the dangerous admissions which the pressure of intellectual pro¬ gress is urging from her professed defenders; the want of vitality and consistency in religious bodies generally; and their utter failure in securing the sympathies of the people, who are nevertheless yearning for spiritual food—all wdrich he regards as proof that a great religious change is as immi¬ nent as it is desirable. According to him, in order to bring the teaching of the churches into correspondence with the intelligence of the age, and to form a truly Catholic Christi¬ anity, there must be a change in relation to the following points: the Inspiration of the Scriptures, Miracles and Prophecy, the Divinity of Christ, and the teaching of Christianity by dogmatical creeds and articles. Each of these subjects is considered separately in the succeeding chapters. The author examines the current ideas of Scrip¬ tural Inspiration, and contends that even the most restricted —that which supposes the sacred writers to have been pro¬ tected by Divine influence from the inculcation of moral error only—is untenable; that the ethics of the New Testa¬ ment are neither complete nor original, having been already taught by heathen sages; that its most important theological doctrines are anticipated in the writings of Plato, a fact which several of the Christian Fathers acknowledged and accounted for by attributing a share of inspiration to the Greek Philosopher; and that Inspiration, in the only ad¬ missible sense, has been given to men in all ages, in the present equally with the past. He maintains that the miracles of the Gospels are not different in then- character from those of the Nicene age, which Protestants reject; that the belief in miracles in any age is proportionate to its igno¬ rance ; that the Divine Philosophy of Christ is not suscep¬ tible of such evidence, nor needs it; and that the notion of Prophecy is founded in a misapprehension of the Divine government. The Divinity of Christ is accepted by the author in no other sense than that Jesus w^as the highest of men, endowed above all others with spiritual insight and divine wisdom, and that the supreme beauty of his life and b2</page><page sequence="10">4 MR. CHAPMAN S PUBLICATIONS. the influence of his unequalled personality were well calcu¬ lated to generate the enthusiasm wrhich saw in him " the fullness of the Godhead." The writer aims to show that dogmatic theology was of very gradual formation, and w as indebted for some of its materials, as well as for its form, to the philosophic systems with which it grew up, rather than to the Scriptures; he considers the dogmas of original sin, justification by faith, etc., their moral influence, as they are generally held, and the elements of truth they contain; and, lastly, he discusses the religious prospects of the age, main¬ taining that a true development of Christianity demands the abandonment of that ivorship of tlie Bible which the Re¬ formers substituted for the idolatries they renounced, and that the only path to a spiritual faith to mankind at large, is general education. GREENWOOD (F. W. P.)—SERMONS OF CON¬ SOLATION: By F. W. P. Greenwood, D.D., Boston, U.S. Third Edition, Post 8vo, cloth, 3*. This work is designed to supply the want which has been felt of books of a consolatory character, adapted for cultivated minds. It contains Twenty-seven Discourses, with the fol¬ lowing titles: " Sorrow and Joy "—" God Incomprehensible'' —" God All-Powerful"—" God the Guardian of Souls"— " Polly of Atheism "—" Dwelling in the Temple "—" Death an Appointment"—" The Time of Death "—" The House of Mourning"—"Consolations of Religion"—"Blessing God in Bereavement"—"Remembrance of the Righteous"— " Nothing without Christ"—" Perpetuity of Christ's King¬ dom"—"Independence of Human Sympathy"—"Christ our Fellow-Sufferer"—"Seeing the Departed"—"The Crown of Thorns"—"Recognition of Friends"—"Voices from Heaven"—"The Good Revealed"—"Walking by Faith" —"Lessons of Autumn"—"It is Well"—"Offices of Me¬ mory "—" Peacefid Sleep "—" Christ with us at Evening." The general character of the sentiments inculcated in the volume, are indicated in the following extract:—" Christianity does not consist in objects which are outwrard, and therefore liable to be worn and to be changed; it does not rest on</page><page sequence="11">"THE CREED OP CHRISTENDOM. 5 things which are passing awray: but it consists in and rests upon those thoughts, sentiments, affections, principles, and objects, which are rooted permanently within, and seated permanently above, and which cannot wear out, nor be weakened, nor pass away." GREG, (W.R.)—THE CREED OF CHRISTENDOM: Its Foundations and Superstructure. By William Ratiibone Greg. 8vo, cloth, 10s. 6d. This work is altogether popular in its method and style, and, apart from other sources of interest and value, may be regarded as a manual of modern biblical criticism for the unlearned. The following is an indication of the course of the writer's argument, and the tenour of his conclusions. The dogma of inspiration, which lies at the root of the popular theology, is, both in its more stringent orthodox sense, and under its recent relaxed modifications, without foundation: we have, in the Old and New Testament, records, not revelations— histories to be investigated like other histories—documents, of wdiich the date, the authorship, the genuineness, the ac¬ curacy of the text, are to be ascertained by the same prin¬ ciples as we apply to other documents. The ascription of the Pentateuch to Moses is an error, modern criticism ha\- ing pronounced that its first four books are a compilation from separate documents, the earliest of which was WTitten as late as the time of Saul, and that the Pentateuch, in its present form, had no existence prior to the reign of Josiah. The exercise of the prophetic gift among the Hebrews, as among other ancient nations, was accompanied by an exag¬ gerated enthusiasm, verging on madness; many of the pro¬ phecies are simply conditional promises or denunciations, while many have not been fulfilled at all, others but partially and loosely; on the showing of Scripture itself, there wrere more false prophets than true; there is little evidence, either external or internal, of the date at which the prophecies were written down; the book of Daniel especially is pro¬ nounced by the best critics to be spurious ; and the passages applied to Christ, in reality either are not prophecies, or</page><page sequence="12">6 MR. chapman's publications. related solely to individuals important in Israelitish history. The Theism of the Jews was impure and progressive: the Hebrews arrived at their monotheism by the same stages that characterize the development of the human race in general, the Old Testament history plainly showTing that the Hebrew Deity was originally the god selected by Abraham out of a multitude of others, to be his Fetish, that this family god was elevated by Moses into a national god, and that it was only the progress induced by contact wdth more refined oriental nations, together with the influence of poets and sages, which at length expanded the idea of him into the God of the universe. The writer then proceeds to the consideration of the New Testament. The five chapters on the origin of the Gospels and the Fidelity of the Gospel History, are a use¬ ful, well-arranged summary of the salient facts and argu¬ ments on their respective subjects, gathered chiefly from Strauss, Hennell, Hug, and Schleiermacher. The result of the examination is as follows:—We have no certitude as to the Gospels' containing the testimony of eye-witnesses ; the larger proportion of their materials presents the strongest intrinsic evidence of being legendary; and we can trust them no further than as giving an outline of the teaching and character of Christ. Hence, dogmas founded on say¬ ings which are attributed to Jesus, but which are inhar¬ monious wdth the general impression conveyed by the Gos¬ pels of his mind and doctrine, must be rejected: such are the dogmas of the Necessity of Belief to Salvation, of the proper Deity of Christ, and of the Atonement. As to the limits of apostolic wisdom and authority, it appears, that the apostles differed from each other in opinion, and dis¬ agreed among themselves; that they held and taught some opinions which we know to be erroneous; and that, both in their general tone and in some important particulars, their teaching differed materially from that of Christ, as depicted in the synoptical gospels. Miracles, wrought by any indi¬ vidual, are not, nor can be, a proof of the truth of the doc¬ trines which he preaches; they are not the basis of Chris¬ tianity, and cannot be a safe foundation on which to rest its claims, inasmuch as they can never be proved by docu¬ mentary evidence, still less by such documentary evidence as wrc possess. The Resurrection of Jesus, even if it wrere proved, which it is not, has not the doctrinal importance attached to it by divines, since, being entirely exceptional in</page><page sequence="13">"THE CREED OP CHRISTENDOM. 7 its character, it can convey no additional guarantee of im¬ mortality to the race. To the question, Is Christianity a revealed religion? Mr. Greg replies, that though Jesus wTas the most exalted religious genius God ever sent upon earth, the perfection of the spiritual character, surpassing all men of all times in closeness and depth of communion with the Father, yet his teaching contains nothing wdiich a genius like that of Christ, brought up and nourished as his had been, might not have disentangled for itself; and that not only is there no necessity for supposing that his views of God and duty were supernaturally revealed to him, but there is almost a necessity for adopting the opposite conclusion, since the Gospels afford much indirect, and therefore valid evidence, that he shared some of the mistakes of his contemporaries. Christianity, then, being no longer regarded as a'revelation, but partly as the conception of a lofty yet fallible mind, partly as the result of historical and doctrinal accretions, it follows that only so much of it is to be accepted as harmo¬ nizes wdth the reason and conscience—in other words, our Christianity becomes Christian eclecticism. Many of Christ's precepts are sublime; for example, those which inculcate the worthlessness of ceremonial observance, and the neces¬ sity of active virtue, purity of heart as the security for purity of life, universal philanthropy, forgiveness of injuries, self-sacrifice in the cause of duty, humility, and genuine sincerity. Next in perfection come the views which Chris¬ tianity unfolds of God as a Father. In the two great points essential to our practical life—our feelings towards God and qur conduct towards man—the Gospels contain little about which men can differ. He is our Father—we are all bre¬ thren. But other tenets taught in the Newr Testament are open to grave objections. The doctrine of the almost un¬ limited efficacy of prayer is at variance with the Scriptural, or wdth any elevated conception of the Deity. Resignation is inculcated, not as a self-renouncing submission to the Supreme Will, in wdiose wisdom and justice perfect confidence is reposed, but on the narrow ground that sufferings are specially ordained for the benefit of the individual. The highest motive—love of the good for its own sake—is rarely appealed to; the motive generally urged is the ultimate reward to be given by Him wdio sees in secret. The notion of the pardon of sin on repentance and conversion contra¬ venes the system on which man is trained and disciplined^</page><page sequence="14">O MR. CHAPMAN S PUBLICATIONS. and the entire scheme of God's government; the conviction that every breach of the Divine law is attended wdth inex¬ orable consequences being essential alike to a healthy con¬ dition of the conscience, and to a just theory of Providence. Lastly, the ascetic and depreciating view of life taught in the Gospels is incompatible with that energetic devotion to the improvement of our race, and with that delight in the innocent adornment of our existence in this world, which are indispensable to a noble and w^ell-balanced soul. Christianity being no longer regarded as a special revela¬ tion, the question of man's future existence remains the great enigma. On this point the views of Christ seem to have been less beyond those of Ms contemporaries than on others, many passages in the Gospels conveying an exagge¬ rated idea of compensation in the future state for the ine¬ qualities of the present, and asserting, wdiat, indeed, is the invariable doctrine of the New Testament, that the pains and pleasures of the life to come are unchanging and eter¬ nal. The WTiter concludes that reason is inadequate to meet the difficulties which surround the belief in a future life, but that this behef is an instinct of the same order as our belief in the reality of the external world—wre doubt a fu¬ ture life only when we begin to reason on it. HENNELL (C. C.)—AN INQUIRY CONCERN¬ ING THE ORIGIN OF CHRISTIANITY: By Charles C. Hennell. Second Edition, 8vo, cloth, 125. The first edition of this work appeared in 1838, when the present strong current of public opinion in favour of free religious discussion had not yet set in, and it probably helped to generate the tone of thought exhibited in more recent wrorks of the same class, to wdiich circumstances have given a wider fame—works which, like the above, in consi¬ dering questions of biblical criticism and the philosophy of Christianity, combine high refinement, purity of aim, and candour, with the utmost freedom of investigation, and with a popularity of style which wins them the attention not only of the learned, but of the practical.</page><page sequence="15">"THE ORIGIN OP CHRISTIANITY." 9 The author opens his inquiry with an Historical Sketch, extending from the Babylonish Captivity to the end of the first century, the design of which is to show how, abstracting the idea of the miraculous, or any speciality of divine influ¬ ence, the gradual development of certain elements in Jew ish character, and the train of events in Jewish history, contri¬ buted to form a suitable nidus for the production of a cha¬ racter and career like that of Jesus, and how the devoted enthusiasm generated by such a career in his immediate disciples, rendering it easier for them to modify their ideas of the Messiah than to renounce their belief in their Master's Messiahship,—the accession of Gentile converts and the destruction of the last remnant of theocracy, necessitating a wider interpretation of Messianic hopes,—the junction of Christian ideas with Alexandrian Platonism, and the decre¬ pitude of Polytheism, combined to associate the name of Jesus, his Messiahship, his death, and his resurrection, w itli a great moral and religious revolution. This historical sketch, which is under the disadvantage of presenting syn¬ thetically ideas based on a subsequent analysis, is intended to meet the difficulty so often urged, and which might be held to nullify the value of a critical investigation, that Christi¬ anity is a fact, for which, if the supposition of a miraculous origin be rejected, no adequate and probable causes can be assigned, and that thus, however defective may be the evi¬ dence of the New Testament history, its acceptance is the least difficult alternative. In the writer's view, the characteristics of the Essene sect, as traced by Josephus and Philo, justify the supposi¬ tion that Jesus was educated in their school of philosophy; but with the elevated belief and purity of life which belonged to this sect, he united the ardent patriotic ideas which had -previously animated Judas of Galilee, who resisted the Roman authority on the ground that God was the only ruler and lord of the Jews. The profound consciousness of genius, a religious fervour which made the idea of the divine ever present to him, patriotic zeal, and a spirit of moral reform, together with a participation in the enthusiastic belief of his countrymen that the long-predicted exaltation of Israel was at hand, combined to produce in the mind of Jesus the gradual conviction, that he was himself the Mes¬ siah, with whose reign that exaltation would commence. He began, as John the Baptist had alreadv done, to an- b 3</page><page sequence="16">10 MR. chapman's publications. nounce "the kingdom of heaven," a phrase which, to the Jewdsh mind, represented the national glorification of Israel; and by his preaching, and the influence of his powerful per¬ sonality, he won multitudes in Galilee to a participation in his belief, that he was the expected Son of David. His public entrance into Jerusalem in the guise which tradition associated with the Messiah, when he sanctioned the homage of the multitude, was probably the climax of his confidence that a great demonstration of divine power, in concurrence with popular enthusiasm, would seat him triumphantly on the throne of David. No such result appearing, his views of the divine dispensation with respect to himself began to change, and he felt the presentiment that he must enter on his Messianic reign through the gates of suffering and death. Viewing Jesus as a pretender not only to spiritual but to political power, as one who really expected the subversion of the existing government to make way for his own king¬ ship (though he probably relied on divine rather than on human means), he must necessarily have appeared in a dan¬ gerous light to those of his countrymen who were in autho¬ rity, and who were anxious at any price to preserve public tranquillity in the presence of the Roman power, ready to visit wdth heavy vengeance any breach of order, and to de¬ prive them of the last remnants of their independence; and hence the motives for his arrest and execution. To account for the belief of the disciples in the resurrection of their Master—a belief wdiich appears to have been sincere—the author thinks it necessary to suppose a certain nucleus of fact, and this he finds in the disappearance of the body of Jesus, a point attested by all the four Evangelists. The secret of this disappearance probably lay wdth Joseph of Arimatha^a and Nicodemus, who were anxious to avoid im¬ plicating themselves with that fermentation of regretful enthusiasm to wdiich a resort of the disciples to the grave might give rise. Animated by a belief in the resurrection, which, being more harmless in the eyes of the authorities than that in a living Messiah, they were permitted to preach with little molestation; the zeal of the disciples wron many converts; a new impulse was given to their cause by the accession of Paul, wdio became the chief missionary of the new faith, as construed by himself, to the Gentiles ; and the concurrence of the causes indicated above, modifying the early creed of the Apostles, and blending it with trains of</page><page sequence="17">"THE ORIGIN OP CHRISTIANITY." 11 thought already prevalent, bore along Christianity in its conquest over the minds of men until it became the domi¬ nant religion of the Roman w^orld. Having sought to show, in this preliminary sketch, that a belief in miracles is not entailed on us by the fact of the early growth of Christianity, the author enters on the inquiry, whether the claims of the Evangelical writers on our credence are such as to sustain the miraculous part of their narratives. The answer is in the negative. He dis¬ cusses, first, the date and credibility of each Gospel, and concludes, that while Matthew has many marvellous stories, incongruous in themselves, and not only unsupported but contradicted by the other Evangelists, he nevertheless pre¬ sents the most comprehensible account of the career of Jesus; that in Mark, evidently more remote in time and circumstances, both from his events and from Jewdsh modes of thought, the idea conveyed of Jesus is much vaguer and less explicable ; that in Luke there is a stdl further modifi¬ cation of his character, which has acquired a tinge of asceti¬ cism ; while in John the style of his teaching is wholly changed, and instead of the graphic parable and the pithy apothegm, he utters long mystical discourses in the style of the first epistle bearing the name of the same Evangelist. Mr. Hennell, however, adheres to the conclusion that the substance of this Gospel came from the Apostle John at an advanced age, when both the events of his early manhood and the scenes of his native land lay in the far distance. The writer then enters on a special examination of the Resurrection and Ascension, and the other miracles in the Gospels and the Acts, and inquires how far they are sus¬ tained by the Apostolic Epistles. He examines the prophe¬ cies of the Old Testament supposed to have been lulfilled in Jesus, and also the predictions of Jesus himself concern¬ ing his death and resurrection; and finally, he considers the character, views, and doctrine of Christ. According to him, an impartial study of the conduct and sayings of Jesus, as exhibited in the Gospels, produces the conviction that he was an enthusiast and a revolutionist, no less than a re¬ former and a moral and religious teacher. Passages are adduced from the Old Testament, and from the Apocryphal and Rabbinical writings, to show that there is scarcely any¬ thing absolutely original in the teaching of Jesus; but in the opinion of the author, he manifests a freedom and. indi¬ viduality in the use of his materials, and a general superi-</page><page sequence="18">12 MR. CHAPMAN'S PUBLICATIONS. ority of tone and selection, which, united with the devotion of his life to what he held the highest purpose, mark him to be of an order of minds occurring but at rare intervals in the history of our race. Shortly after the appearance of this wrork, it wras translated into German through the instrumentality of Dr. Strauss, who, in the Preface he prefixed to it, says:—"Not suffi¬ ciently acquainted with German to read continuously a learned w ork in that language, the labours of our theologi¬ ans were onlyaccessible to him" (the author of the 'Inquiry'), " so far as they were written in Latin, or translated into Eng¬ lish, or treated of in English writings or periodicals ; espe¬ cially he is unacquainted with what the Germans have ef¬ fected in the criticism of the Gospels since Schleiermacher's work on Luke, and even the earlier commentators he knows but imperfectly. Only so much the more remarkable is it, howrever, that both in the principles and in the main results of his investigation, he is on the very track which has been entered on amongst us in recent years That at cer¬ tain periods, certain modes of thought he as it were in the atmosphere and come to light in the most remote places Avithout perceptible media of communication's shown, not only by the contents, but by the spirit, of Mr. Hennell's work. No further traces of the ridicule and scorn wdiich characterize his countrymen of the Deistical school; the subject is treated in the earnest and dignified tone of the truth-seeker, not with the rancour of a passionate polemic; wre nowhere find him deriving religion from priestcraft, but from the tendencies and wants of human nature These elevated views, wrhich the learned German of our day appropriates as the fruit of the religious and scientific advancement of his nation, this Englishman, to whom most of the means at our command were wanting, has been able to educe entirely from himself. An Englishman, a merchant, a man of the world, he possesses, both by nature and by training, the practical insight, the sure tact, which lays hold on realities. The solution of problems over which the German flutters wdth many circuits of learned formulas, our English author often succeeds in seizing at one spring. To the learned he often presents things under a surprisingly new aspect; to the unlearned, invariably under that which is the most comprehensible and attractive."</page><page sequence="19">CHRISTIAN THEISM." 13 HENNELL (C. C.) — CHRISTIAN THEISM. By C. C. Hennell. Demy 8vo, cloth, 2s. 6d. This work is a sequel to the foregoing, being intended to meet the state of mind which follows on the relinquishment of Christianity as a revelation. It first answers the question: What then has Christianity done for the moral and spiritual wrelfare of mankind, and how far does it still contain elements available for this end The writer eloquently shows, that the feature which characterized Christianity at its birth—the pro¬ claiming of the Kingdom of Heaven and the exhortation to prepare for it by reformation of life—was but the form given by an ardent and noble Hebrew^ mind to that yearning and striving after the perfection of our race, consisting in com¬ plete harmony with the Divine Laws, which remains the characteristic of the highest class of minds. The devotion of Jesus to this idea, and the general excellence of his moral teaching, notwithstanding certain exaggerations and defects, secure him the reverential sympathy of the wise and bene¬ volent through all ages. But no longer anchored on Revelation, the soul asks where its hopes are to find a haven P In the teaching and the pro¬ mises of Nature, which, unlike the teachings of tradition, become clearer as time advances. The wise adaptations, the harmonious results in the external world, perceived by man to be analogous with the manifestation of design in his own works, speak of a universal intelligence—a Causing Mind; and the more and more evident tendency to the pre¬ valence of good, of joy and beauty, tells us that this Cause is benevolent. His will—the true table of His command¬ ments—is written in the natural consequences of actions, by which we are effectually taught what to seek and what to shun. God, through Nature, commands us to adorn and ennoble to the utmost the present life. Concerning the fu¬ ture, Nature is sdent; but the testimony she gives to the character of her Author, enables the soul to repose in im¬ plicit confidence on His goodness.</page><page sequence="20">14 MR.

The Religion of Nature holds in profound veneration the memory of Jesus of Nazareth. To him it is largely indebted for its development. His object was to lead men back from Conventionalism to Nature—from Tradition to Reason. His own doctrines have also grown into a Tradition, and are propagated as a Divine Revelation. The object of the First Lecture is to show that Christianity, held upon traditional evidence, as a divinely revealed Faith, cannot permanently subsist, since every traditional Religion contains within itself the seeds of decay. Every such faith must change; otherwise it will, in course of time, be found uncertain, unsuitable, or unintelligible; or it must be presented un¬ altered and comprehensible by methods which reduce Reli¬ gion to Superstition. Religion is a part of human nature universally inherent and necessary, the growth of which is difficult and ungrace¬ ful, solely from neglect and misdirection; the object of the Second Lecture is to showr, that Philosophy is the only means by which to educate rightly the religious sentiments of mankind. Religion is a necessity of our nature; and a Philosophical Religion is the necessity of our Age. IERSON (H.)—RATIONAL FAITH : Three Lectures, by H. Ierson, M.A. Post 8vo, paper cover, Is. The First Lecture is " an Argument addressed to the Reli¬ gious Classes," urging upon them that the pious experience of a few cannot justly overbalance the wants and feelings of the great mass of mankind; that a religion which does not meet, and which by its exclusive character refuses to hold in consideration, the spiritual necessities and claims and aspirations common to all men, but is contented to eat the bread of life in the solitariness of its own privileged election, denies to itself hi such exclusiveness the sole mark of di- vineness by which it could be generally recognized.</page><page sequence="21">"religious scepticism." 15 The Second Lecture is on " the value of Rational Religious Faith, an argument addressed to the Sceptical," showing that there may be uses in Religion apart from its absolute trubh; and that the Sceptic cannot disprove the religious ideas; and, further, that a solid basis of fact does exist in our nature upon which their truth may be established. The faults of scepticism and the faults of orthodoxy pro¬ ceed from the same source—from a partial survey of the facts of the case, and are characterized by the same spirit— bigotry. We must respect the facts of consciousness equally with the facts of external nature. We must study our own nature with simple faith hi wdiat it teaches. Blind doubt is as foolish as blind belief.

LANGFORD (J. A.)—RELIGIOUS SCEPTICISM AND INFIDELITY; Their History, Cause, Cure, and Mission. By J. A. Langford. Post 8vo, cloth, 5s. The History of Infidelity is traced in Rome, France, Ger¬ many, and England. Its Cause is the practical infidelity of Christian churches to their professions, Bibliolatry, Church Establishments, Sectarianism, and the antagonism which professors of religion have ever offered to Philosophy and Science. Its Cure wrould be effected by the restoration of the lost Ideal to the Churches, the Subordination of Doctrinal distinction to unity of Action, the complete alteration of the existing union of Church and State, and the recognition of the use of all our faculties as religious. Its Mission is to arouse the churches to a reconsideration of their principles of action—of their adaptability to the spirit and wants of the Age, and so to lead to attempts to realize purity of life, and truthfulness of thought, and energy of endeavour.</page><page sequence="22">16 MR. chapman's publications. MARTINEAU (J.)—THE RATIONALE OF RELI¬ GIOUS INQUIRY; Or, the Question stated, of Reason, the Bible, and the Church. By James Martineau. Third Edition. With a Cri¬ tical Lecture on Rationalism, Miracles, and the Authority of Scripture, by the late Rev. Joseph Blanco White. Post 8vo, paper cover, 4s.; cloth, 4s. 6d. In the preface to the third edition of this work, the writer states that it no longer fully represents his opinions, but that " the alteration in his point of view, which somewhat estranges him from the volume, consists not in the reversal, but in the further unfolding and prosecution of its judg¬ ments, and in the acquisition of other views so related to these, as to form their complement, and greatly to diminish their apparent magnitude. The path wdiich he has indi¬ cated, through the controversies and sophistries of the day, he still believes to be a right one ; and though well awrare how small a way it leads, he leaves it open for those to whose doubtful feet it may afford true, though temporary guidance." The object of the wrork is to vindicate the supremacy of the reason in matters of religion. According to the author, the doctrine of a special inspiration of the New Testament writers, guaranteeing them from error, and demanding the unconditional submission of the reason, is insusceptible of proof: for that demonstration of accuracy afforded by the independent experimental discovery of the declared truths, if coincident, would supersede the inspired revelation,—if subsequent, would come too late; enlightenment on one point, if proved, does not exclude error on another; the assertion of the party supposed to be inspired, even admit¬ ting his veracity, cannot be accepted as evidence, since he may be mistaken as to the source of his ideas; neither can the gift of miracles prove exemption from error, having been possessed by the apostles at a time when, on their own showing, they held false views of Christ and his mission. One external proof of inspiration is conceivable, namely, a supernatural voice, heard by a competent number of wit¬ nesses, pronouncing a person infallible. Such a divine tes¬ timony was given to none but Jesus; and even in his case there was no announcement that he was universally in-</page><page sequence="23">"endeavours after the christian life." 17 spired, but simply that he was morally the object of divine approbation. All other claims to infaUibility, wdiether made on behalf of the Catholic Church or of a Protestant creed, rest on the absurdity of demanding the renunciation of the reason in submission to an authority on whose credentials the reason must first decide, and of thus impeaching the vali¬ dity of their own foundation. There being thus no escape from a final appeal to the rea¬ son, what is due from us towrards writings which announce themselves as embodying a divine revelation, is not the pro¬ stration of that reason, but its utmost activity—its applica¬ tion, unbiassed by prepossessions, whether of the Calvinist, the Unitarian, or the Anti-Supernaturalist, to the work of ascertaining the character and meaning of the writers, by inquiring whether they wrere truthful in intention, whether and to what extent they wrere likely to err in judgment, and testing all doctrine and all precept by their harmony with those ideas of religion and morals which are gathered from the observation of nature and of human life, and which con¬ stitute the primary revelation of God to man. Such an un¬ biassed application of the reason is likely to issue in an acceptance of the apostolic testimony to the miracles and resurrection of Jesus, and the essential character of his teaching, while it will make manifest that the first promul¬ gators of Christianity shared in the limitations of their age and nation. The concluding lecture is an estimate of the influence of Christianity on morality and civilization. The appendix contains an interesting letter from Blanco White.

It endeavours to be Christian rather than to talk about Chris¬ tianity. In virtue of the close affinity of Religion and Poetry, preaching is essentially a lyric expression of the soul, an utterance of meditation in sorrow, hope, love, and joy, from a representative of the human heart in its divine relations. Under the inspiration of this ideal, the following subjects are discoursed of:—{First Series) The Spirit of Life in Jesus Christ; the Besetting God; Great Principles and Small Duties; Eden and Gethsemane; Sorrow no Sin; Christian Peace; Religion on False Pretences; Mammon- worship ; the Kingdom of God within us ; the Content¬ ment of Sorrow; Immortality; the Communion of Saints ; Christ's Treatment of Guilt; the Strength of the Lonely; Hand and Heart; Silence and Meditation; Winter Wor¬ ship ; the Great Year of Providence; Christ and the Little Child; the Christianity of Old Age ; Nothing Human ever Dies.

NEWMAN (F.W.)—THE SOUL: HER SORROWS AND HER ASPIRATIONS. An Essay towards the Natural History of the Soul, as the Basis of Theology. By Francis William Newman, for¬ merly Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford, and Author of ' A History of the Hebrew Monarchy/ Post 8vo. [See ' Library for the People/] This work probably gives expression to the convictions of many intelligent and devout minds, which, while accepting the verdicts of modern criticism on the letter of Scripture, and holding that the apostolic dicta carry no authority be¬ yond the degree in which they recommend themselves to the intellect and the moral sense, yet find in the Bible, and especially in the devotional parts of the Old Testament and the writings of Paul, the most complete representation of those instincts and emotions which constitute, in their idea, the communion of the human with the divine. The stand¬ point of the writer is this: that the mental phenomena which have been knowTi as " Christian experience" are not dependent on superstitious beliefs, and destined to vanish before the brightening light of human intelligence ; that, on the contrary, these phenomena, though they have been com¬ plicated and perverted by erroneous opinion, are, neverthe¬ less, the pulsations of the true spiritual life of man, wdiich will only gather intensity by a fuller development of his nature. The soul is that side of our nature by which we are in contact with the Infinite, the inner sense or organ by which man perceives Deity. The germ of this percep¬ tion is that awe, under the sense of the limitless unknown, which, as the individual and the race advance in the con¬ templation of nature and the observation of their inward life, expands into the recognition of an Infinite Mind, sus¬ taining the universe and possessing moral attributes, of which the moral instincts of man are faint reflections. The freedom of the human will, attested by the consciousness,</page><page sequence="26">20 MR. chapman's publications. is the main step to this conclusion; and it is this freedom of the will, essential in order to render man a moral being, which makes it possible to reconcile the existence of evil and suffering with the perfect goodness of the Deity, all evd being seen to flow from the antagonism of the human will with the divine. The soul, having reached this stage of belief, becomes conscious of its sinfulness in the presence of a perfect moral Being, the source of its existence and the just claimant of its entire obedience; but with the earnest desire for purity and harmony with the divine will, comes that confidence in God's love and acceptance which consti¬ tutes the essence of the doctrine of Justification by Faith. Here commences that sense of personal relation to God which is a well-spring of peace and joy, a sustaining influ¬ ence under heavy mental and physical suffering, and an in¬ exhaustible source of moral and spiritual strength. A deepening sense of the divine love rather enables the soul to resign itself in the absence of evidence as to a future life, than affords an assurance on the subject. The style of the work is lucid and simple, in accordance with the view which the writer urges, that theology is essentially popular, and that religion is a matter for spiri¬ tual insight, not for mental acuteness. In the last part, the author treats of the prospects of Christianity, and main¬ tains that its tardy progress has been owing to that mis¬ taken view of Christian evidences which aims at establish¬ ing the authenticity of the letter, instead of confiding hi the witness of the conscience.

The first doctrinal difficulty wdiich had a practical effect on the writer's career, was the conviction, arrived at wdiile he wras yet an Oxford student, that infant baptism was not a primitive institution; a conviction which, united with the perception that the genuine sense of the Chinch Ritual conveys the doctrine of Baptismal Regeneration, wrould, he saw, preclude his entering the ministry of the Church of England. The study of the Fathers tended to heighten his sense of the unapproachable superiority of the New Testa¬ ment, and served to determine his attachment to the Bible, in all its simplicity, as the only reliable source of religious guidance. The taking of his degree at Oxford, and the be¬ coming a Fellow of Balliol, were succeeded by his acceptance of a tutorship in Ireland, for fifteen months, during winch he fell under the influence of a remarkable man, wiiom he designates as " the Irish Clergyman." The enthusiastic but consistent literalness with wdiich this individual applied the text of Scripture to actual life, together with his owrn intense perception that the spirit of the apostolic teaching wras opposed to all energetic exertion for other than spiri¬ tual ends, assisted in determining the author to set out with friends of like mind on a mission to the East, not identified with any Church or sect. On his return to Eng¬ land, at the end of two years, a modification of his ideas concerning the Trinity, and other symptoms of a disposition to independent inquiry, had the painful effect of alienating from him most of his orthodox friends. Further study led to the gradual renunciation of Calvinism, of Biblical Infalli- bility, and of all faith at second-hand, or reliance on human testimony, as a foundation for belief in spiritual truths. The author finds his ultimate point of repose in the conclusion, that the nucleus or vivifying principle of all religions is the belief in the sympathy of God with individual man-1—a belief based on the intuitions of our moral nature. According to him, it is the pervading presence of this sentiment in the devotional works of the Hebrews, and in the Christian writ¬ ings, which, notwithstanding the admixture of erroneous conceptions, renders them, in distinction from all philoso¬ phical systems, the truest expressions of man's religious nature. This wrork is valuable, not only as the religious history of a distinguished mind, but also as containing important con-</page><page sequence="28">22 mr. chapman's publications. siderations on the general influence of Christianity, the veneration of Jesus as the Ideal Man, and other subjects interesting to the theological inquirer. NEWMAN (F. W.)— HISTORY OF THE HEBREW MONARCHY, From the Administration of Samuel to the Babylonish Captivity. By Francis William Newman, formerly Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford, and Author of c The Soul: her Sorrows and her Aspirations/ etc. 8vo, cloth, 10s. 6d. This work presents the results without the ostentation of research, and with perfect freedom of criticism unites a reverent and sympathetic spirit. It is equally adapted to guide the student and to interest those who are familiar with the writer's subject, and can, therefore, duly estimate his accuracy and comprehensiveness, and the soundness of his original suggestions. After a sketch of the land of Israel, the distribution of its tribes, their relations with the original inhabitants, and some of their prominent social characteristics, the history opens with the administration of Samuel, wdiose character is re¬ garded in a favourable light as that of a disinterested patriot and religious reformer, who sought to establish the nation¬ ality of the Hebrews by reclaiming them from the worship of other gods than Jehovah, and who, by founding " the schools of the prophets," eminently contributed to elevate his countrymen from religious and moral barbarism. In delineating the position and agency of the prophets, the writer showrs that they often blended, with a noble poetic faculty and high religious enthusiasm, no slight degree of fanaticism, as is perhaps indicated by the fact that the same Hebrew word signifies at once "to prophesy" and "to be mad," and more clearly by the extravagant acts wdiich they attribute to themselves, and which the Old Testament generally represents as appropriate to the pro¬ phetic character. Still it is maintained that the prophets were the true spiritual teachers of Israel, the denouncers of idolatry and ceremonialism, and that they essentially</page><page sequence="29">"HISTORY OF THE HEBREW MONARCHY." 23 differed from the minstrels and bards of the Gentile na¬ tions in this, " that their first and great aim and end wras to please and honour God, in faith, that from obedience to Him the highest good of man would assuredly follow." Throughout the work the author has occasion to show the untrustworthiness of the Chronicles compared with the books of Samuel and of the Kings, as constantly exag¬ gerating numbers, suppressing facts unfavourable to the sacerdotal class or its royal patrons, and interpreting events in a superstitiously Jehovistic rather than a moral spirit. In connection with the discovery under Solomon of the two tables of stone in the ark, the author suggests an interest¬ ing inquiry as to the existence of three diverse copies of the Decalogue. He points out the difference, uniformly over¬ looked by divines, betwreen the versions given in the 20th and 34th chapters of Exodus. The well-knowrn version in the 20th chapter is said to have been uttered by the voice of Jehovah, but is not in Exodus said to have been written on the tables, ch. xxxi. 18 simply stating that these wrere written on with the finger of God and given to Moses, but not telling us what wras written. The first pair of tables Moses broke, and in Exodus xxxiv. he ascends the mo ant with a second pair of blank tables, on wdiich Jehovah writes a Decalogue, presenting very important variations from the above. According to Exodus, therefore, the latter was the Decalogue written on the tables of stone, and Deuterono¬ my, wdiich sanctions the popular notion, contradicts Exodus. This might lead to the inference that the 34th chapter con¬ tains the genuine Mosaic Decalogue, and that the other is a modernized improvement. But the waiter observes that there are many complex phenomena to be considered before hazarding a conclusion; among the rest, the apparent exis¬ tence, in Exodus xxiii. 10-19, of a mutilated third copy of the Decalogue, wdiich is less spiritual even than that in the 34th chapter. In the course of the history, also, evidence is shown that the Levitical system and the centralization of worship in Jerusalem were of very gradual rise, and that the kings most lauded for their piety, before Josiah, permitted the worship of Jehovah on the high places, and under em¬ blems afterwards pronounced idolatrous ; but the author accepts the representation that Jehovah was the original Deity of the Hebrews, and that the worship of Baal and Astarte wras an apostasy into which they were seduced by</page><page sequence="30">24 MR. chapman's publications. intercourse and royal intermarriage with their Phoenician neighbours. It is argued that the four first books of the Pentateuch were a growth, not a composition, and that a considerable part of them, together with the wdiole of Deu¬ teronomy, must have been unknown prior to the religious reformation under Josiah. The subject matter of the vari¬ ous prophets, and their influence, as contrasted with that of the priests, are vividly characterized, and those move¬ ments of surrounding nations which had a bearing on the destinies of Israel are vigorously sketched. The chronolo¬ gical difficulties of the history are thoroughly considered. The entire work is an able attempt to render compre¬ hensible and interesting a portion of history wdiich, in England, has been comparatively neglected and little un¬ derstood. The struggles and successes of David, the cul¬ mination of Hebrew prosperity under Solomon, the subse¬ quent division of the kingdom, the revolution in Israel under Jehu and in Judea under the priest Jehoiada, the foreign alliances and hostilities of the nation with their bearing on its religious development, the ministry of the prophets, from the eloquent remonstrances of Joel to the hopeful strains of the later Isaiah—all the chequered for¬ tunes of the Hebrew people, from the time when they took a king " like all the nations" to the Babylonish capitivity,— appear, under the author's treatment, no longer exceptional, and, therefore, removed from the sphere of our understand¬ ing and sympathy, but as part of the same web with the rest of the wrorld's wrondrous history. PARKER (T.) —A DISCOURSE OF MATTERS PERTAINING TO RELIGION. By Theodore Parker. New Edition, Post 8vo, cloth. The author of this work is a minister of religion in Boston, United States, and is distinguished from the great majority of the ministers around him by his rejection of all authority save that of nature and reason,—the one as teacher, and the other as interpreter. Believing religion to have a constitu¬ tional place in the human soul and capable of development like morality or art, and believing that its development, hitherto, has been retarded rather than promoted by the</page><page sequence="31">"A HISTORY AND THEORY OF RELIGION. 25 different religious sects of Christendom, with their tradi¬ tions and systems, he throws himself into the arms of nature —assumes the functions of the Prophet, and speaks truth at first-hand, as it dawns upon him, instead of retailing it at second-hand, as delivered by authority. ITe holds Revelation to be a universal gift, and Inspiration to be a faculty capable of universal culture, wdiich has Prophecy in its original and largest sense as its appropriate function. The present work consists of lectures delivered in Boston on the establishment of the church over wdiich he presides, and contains a clear and full exposition of his viewrs on all the great questions of religious interest. The design is to recall men from the transient shows of time to the perma¬ nent substance of religion—from a worship of books and forms to a worship in spirit and in life. It is the author's hope that it will tend to satisfy the doubting soul, and help the serious inquirer to true views of God and man, so as to ascertain the true relation between them, and exhibit reli¬ gion in a light more congenial, and a divine life in a light more beautiful, than they ordinarily appear to the world. The ' Discourse' is divided into five subordinate Discourses, or Books, and these again subdivided into chapters. In fact, the ' Discourse' is a comprehensive and systematic treatise on the history and theory of Religion. The first Book is " Of Religion in general; or a Discourse of the Religious Sentiment and its manifestations," in wdiich he shows that the religious sentiment is a natural, essential, universal, and indestructible part of the human constitution ; —that Religion essentially consists in " a sense of depend¬ ence" (without, however, disclosing the character,and still less the nature and essence of the object on which it depends)— that the Idea or Fact of God is all that we can attain to, and is practically better than either resthig in the sentiment, which tends to pantheistic mysticism, or indulging in any imaginative conception, which tends to anthropomorphism and thence to polytheism. He then traces the develop¬ ments, characteristics, and moral influences of the three great historical forms of religion, viz., Fetichism, Polytheism, and Monotheism, and closes with an inquiry into the great religious doctrines of the origin and destiny of man; exhi¬ biting the various opinions on his primitive condition, and on his prospective immortality; showing the wronderful cu¬ riosity which has ever been manifested in regard to the twin question, whence he came, and whither he goeth. G</page><page sequence="32">26 MR. CHAPMAN'S PUBLICATIONS. The second Book is on the " Relation of the Religious Sentiment to God, or a Discourse of Inspiration," giving a comparative estimate of the three leading tendencies of spe¬ culation upon the subject, viz., the rationalistic view, or Na¬ turalism ; the anti-rationalistic view, or Supernaturalism; and the natural-religious view, or Spiritualism. The last is the view adopted and defended by Mr. Parker. The third Book is on the " Relation of the Religious Sen¬ timent to Jesus of Nazareth, or a Discourse of Christianity," in which he inquires into the real character of the Christian records, and into the leading elements and characteristics of the Christian doctrines; discussing, at the same time, the question of authority in relation to Christ, as wrell as illus¬ trating Christ's personal character, and the real nature of his mission. The fourth Book is on the " Relation of the Religious Sentiment to the greatest of Books, or a Discourse of the Bible," in which he examines the real character and history of the Bible, and the claims made for it to be a divine, super¬ natural, exclusive, and infallible revelation. The fifth and last Book is on the " Relation of the Reli¬ gious Sentiment to the greatest of human institutions, or a Discourse of the Church," in which the claims of the Chris¬ tian Church to be a supernatural institution are discussed, its gradual formation traced, its fundamental and distinc¬ tive idea indicated, its various sects in ancient and mo¬ dern times estimated, and in particular three prominent parties now struggling within her—the Catholic party, the Protestant party, and " the party that is neither Catholic nor Protestant." "We want real Christianity," says the author, at the close of his book, " the Absolute Religion preached with faith, and applied to life,—Being Good, and Doing Good. There is but one real religion; we need only open our eyes to see that; only live it, in love to God and love to man, and we are blessed of Him that liveth for ever and ever."</page><page sequence="33">THE LIFE OF JESUS." 27 STRAUSS (D. F.)—THE LIFE OF JESUS, CRI¬ TICALLY EXAMINED. By Dr. David Fried- rich Strauss. 3 vols. 8vo, cloth, 11. 16s. This work first appeared in Germany, in 1835, and speedily gained a European reputation. Its aim is to show that the narratives of the New Testament, like all other religious re¬ cords, are mythical, not historical; that in the Gospels we have not a statement of facts derived from the testimony of eye-witnesses, but a collection of myths and legends, having their source, on the one hand, in the Jewish conception of the Messiah, on the other, in the actual character and career of Jesus. In order to prove this position, Dr. Strauss en¬ ters into a minute critical examination of the Gospels ; and as he discusses with great fairness the chief opinions and in¬ terpretations opposed to his own, he thus presents us with a compendious survey of German criticism on this portion of the New Testament. The completeness of the negative part of the work,—the fullness with wdiich the waiter exhi¬ bits the arguments against the historical character of the Gospel narratives,—has given it an importance quite inde¬ pendent of the positive part, or his theory of their forma¬ tion. Many who deny that he has shown wdiat those narra¬ tives are, hold him to have satisfactorily proved what they are not. In the Introduction, the author traces the development of the mythical point of view, considers the nature and origin of myths, weighs the alleged objections on external and in¬ ternal grounds to the possibUity of myths in the New Testa¬ ment, and lays down the principles by which he will be guided in discriminating between the historical and unhis- torical in the Gospel narratives. The following is a sketch of this prehininary matter:—Wherever a religion, appealing to written documents, retains its supremacy through a suc¬ cession of ages, the progress of mental culture necessitates a corresponding change in the interpretation of those docu¬ ments. Examples of this are seen in the various philosophic explanations of the Greek mythology by the Stoics and others, and in the allegorical interpretation of the Old Tes¬ tament narratives by the more enlightened Jews, especially by Philo. Christianity, coming into the world in a civilized age, jarred at its very commencement with an already exist- c2</page><page sequence="34">28 MR. chapman's publications. ing mental culture ; in this case the disagreement felt was not, as before, between modern culture and an ancient reli¬ gion, but between a new rehgion and ancient culture. The allegorizing of Origen and the attacks of Celsus on the Chris¬ tian writings were symptoms of this disagreement. But as heathen culture was gradually submerged by northern bar¬ barism, wdiich submitted itself to the teaching of the Church, the struggle of the intellect with Christianity subsided into the quiescence of the Middle Ages. The Reformation was the first manifestation of a new culture strong enough to recommence the struggle, which in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries wras carried on in a hostile and con¬ temptuous spirit by the English Deists, and in Germany by Reimarus, the author of the celebrated ' Wolfenbiittel Frag¬ ments.' In opposition to this school, which impugned the integrity of the Christian writers, there arose in Germany the Rationalists, who, wdiile renouncing the miraculous in the biblical narratives, yet retained the supposition that they were records of contemporary events, and sought to defend the veracity of the writers by representing their supernatu- ralism as merely a figurative drapery proper to their age, wdiich the enlightened interpreter might easily draw aside, and disclose the simple historic fact. This rationalistic system of interpretation was first thoroughly applied to the Old Testament by Eichhorn, to the New by Paulus ; but it as little satisfied the requirements of sound criticism as of the religious sentiment, and the growing perception of the impossibility of according to the Old Testament narratives, at least, the character of history, gradually led to the adop¬ tion of the mythical point of view. The researches of the Germans into mythology generally, had thrown great light on the nature of the myth as a necessary element in the early history of all nations. The natural presumption that the history of the Hebrews would not form an exception, was confirmed by the strongly-marked mythical characteris¬ tics which, on an impartial examination, it wTas found to ex¬ hibit, and which De Wette, especially, has well discerned and pointed out. Greater difficulty was felt in applying the mythical system of interpretation to the New Testament, because myths were regarded as the product of the primi¬ tive ages only, when no written records existed, whereas at the Christian era writing was common among the Jews. But it was urged on the other hand, that Christianity was of popular origin, and that the events in the life of Jesus</page><page sequence="35">" THE LIFE OF JESUS." 29 were the subject of oral tradition for a considerable time be¬ fore they were committed to writing. Many distinguished theologians admitted the application of the mythical theory to the New Testament, though they failed to apprehend that application clearly, and shrank from consistently carrying it out. It is essential to the mythical system, that the writings to which it is applied shall have had their origin at a consi¬ derable interval after the events of which they treat. The external evidence as to the proximity of the evangelical writers to the occurrences they describe, is too vague and meagre to weigh at all against the internal evidence to the contrary which it is the object of this work to exhibit. There is nothing in the ancient testimonies to exclude the suppo¬ sition, which all a priori considerations render probable, that our four Gospels only gradually received their present form after the materials of which they are composed had been long floating on the current of oral tradition. It is only neces¬ sary to form a just conception of Palestine and of the real position of the " eye-witnesses," in order to understand how, even during the life-time of Jesus, legends respecting hiir. might be current. The popular Jewish mind with its native love of the marvellous, stimulated by a new religious enthu¬ siasm, with its stirring national traditions and Messianic ex¬ pectations, was exactly the soil for the fertile production of myths. If it be admitted that the biblical history is less offensive to our conception of Deity than the heathen mytho¬ logy, it is not less at variance with the idea which is the very essence of modern culture,—that, namely, of the invariabi¬ lity of cause and effect, or, to express it theologically, the conviction that " God acts upon the world as a whole imme¬ diately, but on each part only by means of His action on every other part, that is to say, by the laws of nature." The true conception of the myth does away with the imputation of fraud or premeditated deception. A myth is the gradu¬ ally wrought expression of popular ideas, which embody them¬ selves, not in the language of abstractions and generalities, but in imagined facts corresponding to the genius of the community. In the case of the early Jewish Christians the material for their myths was amply accumulated in the tra¬ ditionary details concerning the Messiah, drawn by rabbini¬ cal interpretation from the Old Testament. These traditions they firmly believed; but, on the other hand, they were equally convinced that Jesus was the Messiah. The natural result was the transference and accommodation to the life</page><page sequence="36">30 MR. chapman's publications. of Jesus of all the Messianic characteristics—a blending together of what the Messiah was expected to be, with what Jesus actually wras. The mythical materials of the Gospels are various in their character, some myths being purely con- ceptional, others probably having as their groundwork a specific fact or saying, round which oral tradition gradually deposited picturesque or supernatural incidents, while many unhistorical elements arc to be referred to the compiler's effort to give point and cohesion to his narrative. The chief criteria by wdiich the author distinguishes the unhistorical in the Gospels are—irreconcilability with the known univer¬ sal laws which guide the course of events ; inconsistency of a narrative with itself or contradiction of other accounts; a poetic form (though the absence of this is no proof that a narrative is historical); an appearance of having been mo¬ delled after prevalent ideas, the result of preconceived opi¬ nion rather than of experience, as where, in relation to the birth of John the Baptist, we know that the Jews were fond of representing their great men as the children of parents who had long been childless; with others already indicated in the foregoing observations. To establish the mythical character of any particular narrative, several of these criteria must concur. But, after all, it will be impossible to fix the boundary between the historical and unhistorical in the Gos¬ pels. The author, when he is obliged to conclude that we know not what happened, would avoid the imputation of pronouncing that nothing happened. The plan on which Dr. Strauss proceeds in his critical ex¬ amination of the Gospels is to treat the events in the life of Jesus under three great divisions,—the history of his birth and childhood, the history of his public life, and the history of his passion, death, and resurrection. In considering any one subject under either of these heads, he first gives all the matter relating to it to be found in the four Evangelists, and states the questions and difficulties connected with it; he then examines the solutions offered by the Rationalistic and Supranaturalistic theologians; and lastly, he either states his own conclusions, or shows that the arguments are too equally balanced for an impartial judgment to come to a decision. His searching criticism overlooks no detail of the Gospel narratives, no point of view from which they may be regarded, and he presents opposing considerations with philosophic impartiality. The following specimens of his results will show the bearing of his work on some much debated points.</page><page sequence="37">" THE LIFE OF JESUS." 31 In discussing the locality of the public life of Jesus, the chief theatre of which, according to the synoptical writers, was Galilee, according to the fourth Evangelist, Jerusalem, the author, after more than one alteration in the earlier edi¬ tions, at length contents himself with a full statement of the arguments on each side so as clearly to exhibit to the reader the state of the controversy. But it is evident, both here and in succeeding parts of his work, where he examines the discourses of Jesus in the fourth Gospel, and compares the style of narration which characterizes the different Evan¬ gelists, that he assigns a general superiority to the synop¬ tical writers, as conveying the more truthful and compre¬ hensible idea of the teaching and career of Jesus. To the question whether there was a political element in the Mes¬ sianic plan of Jesus, Strauss replies very decidedly in the negative. In his opinion, Jesus, at no period of his career, had any intention to make the zeal of his adherents an in¬ strument of political revolution, but expected the establish¬ ment of his Messianic reign as the result purely of a Divine interposition, the time and nature of which he regarded as the secret of his heavenly Father, apparently retaining his confidence even on the near approach of his end. Not that the Messianic idea of Jesus wras purely spiritual; it included, with a moral and religious reformation, a stupendous material change, a 7raXtyyevecrta or regeneration of external things; but the means by which it was to be fulfilled were entirely supernatural: it was the theocratic hope of his nation, spiri¬ tualized and ennobled by his own moral and religious views. After deciding that wre have no valid evidence of the Resur¬ rection, Strauss endeavours to account for the undeniably sincere belief of the disciples on this head, by supposing that a considerable interval elapsed between the Crucifixion and the first preaching of the Resurrection by the apostles in Jerusalem; that shortly after the death of Jesus his disciples returned, as a passage in Matthew indicates, to their homes in Galilee; and that here the profoimd conviction which Jesus had created in their minds of his Messiahship,—a con¬ viction only temporarily annihilated by his death,—revived, and led them, in accordance with Jewish notions of evidence, to the discovery of proofs in the Old Testament that an igno¬ minious death was part of his predestined Messianic career. This idea once established in their minds, Jesus was no longer lost to them, but had simply entered on one stage of his Messianic glory, from which their faith held it inevitable</page><page sequence="38">32 MR. chapman's publications. that he would vouchsafe some manifestations of his abiding love to his forlorn followers. An acquaintance with the his¬ tory of religious societies renders it easily conceivable that this faith of the disciples would either cause them to con¬ strue some natural event into a revelation or appearance of Jesus, or, in the more enthusiastic, would produce visions to which they assigned an external reality, and that these visions again would lead to the conviction that his body, as well as his spirit, had escaped from the bonds of the grave. Here was a nucleus for the creation of legends concerning his Resurrection, such as are found in the Gospels. In the concluding dissertation, on the dogmatic import of ' The Life of Jesus,' the author proposes to answrer the ques¬ tion—What significance have the Gospel narratives for the religious sentiment, when criticism has destroyed their his¬ torical authority He sketches the various Christologies, or theories concerning the import of the life of Jesus, and states the objections to be alleged against them. The Chris- tology of the orthodox system, developed on the basis of an implicit belief in the Gospel narratives, regards Christ as the God-man, who by the active obedience of his life and the passive obedience of his death satisfied, in our stead, the de¬ mands of the divine lawr, and wiio, being risen from the dead and exalted to the right hand of the Father, governs the world as a mediatorial king, and will finally appear as the universal Judge. Theologians of various schools have shown that this system is as untenable in the face of philosophy as of criticism. According to the Christology of Rationa¬ lism, Jesus was a Divine Messenger providentially endowed and sent in a fitting age of the world to be the teacher of a pure and excellent religion, which he illustrated and enforced by his exemplary life and sublime death. Schleiermacher, averse to the barrenness of the latter theory, but pre-emi¬ nently alive to the contradictions of the orthodox system, constructed an eclectic Christology, which takes as its basis the consciousness of the Christian, and infers from that ex¬ perience of spiritual influence which follows on communion with the Church, the perfection of Christ, its Head, as the Ideal of humanity. Kant also regarded historical proof in relation to the life of Jesus as of comparatively little mo¬ ment, and interpreted the Gospel narratives as a set of sym¬ bols shadowing forth spiritual truths. Lastly, the specula¬ tive Christology of the Hegelian school, to which Strauss himself adheres, holds that in the supposed life of Jesus the</page><page sequence="39">"CHRISTIAN aspects of faith and duty." 33 human mind has unconsciously embodied the eternal truths of man's nature and destiny, as a manifestation of the Di¬ vine. The work concludes with a consideration of the different courses open to the theologian, wdio, in consequence of his philosophical enlightenment, finds his inward conviction at variance with the form of doctrine which his position in the Church binds him to teach. TAYLER (J. J.)—CHRISTIAN ASPECTS OF FAITH AND DUTY. Discourses by J. J. Tayler, B.A. Post 8vo, cloth, 7s. 6d. The Religious Sentiment is recognized as having its seat in those primitive tendencies of our nature, which all reasoning tacitly assumes and acts upon. In the heart is the hidden fount of Faith, which must gush up within the man, and cannot flow into him from without. It has been the pro¬ blem of ages, how to uphold this primitive Faith—this Faith in spiritual realities and omnipresent mind—in free and living harmony with the irresistible conclusions of science, and the encroaching influences of material wealth. To as¬ sist in promoting this harmony is the object of this volume. Its aim is to exhibit the living spirit of the Religion of Christ; to kindle enthusiasm for what is pure and noble and generous; to urge to a high and self-denying virtue; to strengthen faith under affliction and trial; and to foster a calm and holy trust in the last great change. The topics of Discourse are—Spiritual Hunger and Thirst; Man's Ascent to God; God's Descent to Man; Christ the Mediator; the Harmony of the Divine and Human in Christ; the Distinctive and Permanent in Christianity; the Footsteps of Christ; the Veil taken from the Heart; the Coincidence of General and Special Providence; the True Expression of Human Brotherhood; Faith, the Assurance of the Soul; the Spirit of the Commandments, and the Spirit of Life; the Blessing of Sorrow; More Justice and less Charity; Simplicity of Heart; the True Knowledge of Life; the Religion of the Intellect, and the Religion of the Heart; the Grounds and Limits of Spiritual Authority; the Change of Death; Retrospect and Anticipation (deli¬ vered December 29th, 1850). c3</page><page sequence="40">34 MR. chapman's publications. TAYLER (J. J.)—A RETROSPECT OF THE RE¬ LIGIOUS LIFE OF ENGLAND; Or, the Church, Puritanism, and Free Inquiry. By John James Tayler, B.A. Post 8vo, 10s. 6c?. cloth. The aim of this work is to embrace, in a common point of view, the phenomena of the different religious parties, whose uniutermitted strife, and sharp contrast of manners and opinions, have given such a deep and varied interest to the spiritual history of England, especially during the three centuries which have elapsed since the Reformation. In pursuing this idea, the author has tried to discover the go¬ verning principle, and understand the characteristic working of each party—to apprehend their mutual relation—to show how they have occasionally passed off into each other—and out of their joint operation, to trace the evolution of a more comprehensive principle, which looks above the narrowness of their respective views, and, allying itself with the essen¬ tial elements of the Christian faith, may in time perhaps devise some method of reconciling an unlimited freedom and variety of the religious life with the friendliness and mutual recognition of universal brotherhood. " Our practical English mind—so different from that of our French and German neighbours—concentrates its inte¬ rest on the present. We may be—I believe wre are—in a course of progressive advancement; but the present is the daughter of the past—'Matre pulchra filia pulchrior'—and only as the present comprehends and wisely reverences that filial relationship, will she become the mother of a still more beauteous future." THOM (J. H.)—ST. PAUL'S EPISTLES TO THE CORINTHIANS: An Attempt to convey their Spirit and Significance. By the Rev. John Hamilton Thom. In 1 vol., cloth, 9s.

Paul's epistles to the Corinthians." 35 gious truth is in the desire, that spiritual things may by them be spiritually discerned; and who seek and worship truth, as they worship and seek after God, with a hunger and thirst for realities, and with a love that casts out fear. " This work will not serve for aU the purposes of a Com¬ mentary. It does not attempt to solve every difficulty of expression; nor even to notice all the accidental views, the investiture of circumstance and tradition, wdiich were clearly not inherent in the soul of Paul, nor essential to his con¬ ception of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus. I have not, indeed, avoided these matters when they lay in my way; much less have I tried to conceal that such things are; or sought to make St. Paul think like a modern, and write to Corinthians, in the first century of Christianity, as one sometimes, with longing, conceives of a Prophet and Apostle speaking to England and Englishmen in the nineteenth. But I have not gone far, nor frequently, out of my direct way for the sake of matters of mere antiquarian interest, that have no permanent relation to the human soul, or to Christian truth. What I undertake to exhibit is the strong, clear current of spiritual thought in the Apostle's mind, not all the immaterial elements it may have held in solution, or mechanically carried in its course." (Pref.) The twTo epistles thus handled are the liveliest pictures we possess of the first action of Christianity on the Religion and Philosophy of the Grecian mind. They exhibit, prin¬ cipally, the doctrines of spiritual freedom; of the direct intercourse of each soul with God, without the aid of sys¬ tem, ritual, or priesthood; of the moral salvation of oneness of heart and will with God, through the moral attraction of His Christ; and in their antagonistic aspects, they are mainly opposed to asceticism; to superstitious observances; to violations of unity of spirit; and to the admixture of speculative tenets with the simple acceptance of Christ as the Law of Life, the Image of the Father, and the first-born of many brethren to the holy power and glorious liberty of a Son of God. In this work, Christianity is exhibited as a spirit and a power, not as a form and a dogma. It is a revelation, not of speculative tenets to the intellect, but of moral beauty to the affections, and accomplished through the medium, not of emblems, but of realities; not of language, but of life, as being the most direct outward appeal that the spirit of God can address to the embodied spirit of man.</page><page sequence="42">£6 MR. chapman's publications. WILSON (T.)— CATHOLICITY, SPIRITUAL AND INTELLECTUAL : An Attempt at Vindicating the Harmony of Faith and Knowledge. A Series of Discourses. By T. Wilson, M.A., late Minister of St. Peter's, Mancroft, Norwich, Author of " Travels in Egypt and Syria," etc. 8vo, cloth, 5s. May be had separately, Is. each, paper cover. This work is an attempt at Discourses of a more expansive scope and less dogmatic tone than would be suited to an ecclesiastical pulpit. The spirit of Christianity is exhibited, but the letter of systematic theology, patristic or mediaeval, is not adhered to, when judged to interfere with the great pandects of religious principle asserted in the Gospel of Christ, and confirmed by the conscience of mankind. The transitional aspect of polemical divinity at the present time seems to the author to warrant some such experiment as that which he has here ventured upon. Passing events tend more and more to prove the actual doctrinal position of the Anglican Church untenable, assailed as it is, and is to be, on both sides at once, by forces rallying to one or other of the two hostile standards, hoisted as Moman or Mational. These two ensigns of the Past and Future are daily drawing round them some of the best and boldest spirits of the land, in search of that rest for the soul which reality and consistency can alone afford, but neither of wdiich they can henceforth find in the theory or practice of com¬ promise. The object in view in these Discourses is to vindicate the soul's jurisdiction in her own cause, asserting the sufficiency and supremacy of the inner Court of Appeal in all questions involving spiritual interests. Religion is considered as the service of the mind no less than the soul, but with a distinc¬ tion between the really Catholic culture of the devotional faculties, and that of the intellectual powers which go to the critical sifting of historic or external evidence, with the nice adjustment of conflicting probabilities. A deep and broad distinction is recognized between Faith as an earnest, hum¬ ble, and yearning aspiration Godward, and Opinion as a result of enlightened judgment, or Credulity as an ignoble</page><page sequence="43">"catholicity, spiritual and intellectual." 37 abnegation of the rights and obligations of manhood. These Discourses proceed upon the principle of rendering to the mind the things that are mental, and to the soul the things that are spiritual. Pursuing this method, the author dis¬ courses of the " Relative Rank of our Earth among Stellar Worlds," (aiming to elevate the reader from a merely mun¬ dane to a heliocentric position, and thence to have his vision trained to broader and. truer views of the universal scheme than are possible while bewildered in the labyrinths of scholastic theology), "The Inner Kingdom," "Salvation,"and " Scholastic Theology," together with an Appendix of expla¬ nations. In general terms it may be stated, that the only faith held worthy in this book, of the name of Catholic or universal, is a devout, earnest, and habitual trust in one all- wise and powerful Creator, whose perfect wisdom in every arrangement is not the less certain for its present partial eclipse to mortal vision; and the only worship wrorthy of such a God must be the reverential study and fulfilment of His laws. What we need to be convinced of is, the inevi¬ table and immutable nature of the divine laws of our exist¬ ence, however distinguished as physical, moral, intellectual, or spiritual. Let men once be assured that they can no more violate the eternal statutes of Truth and Equity with¬ out entailing commensurate degradation and suffering, than they can thrust their hand into the fire without bodily mis¬ chief, and from that hour all priestly systems of " substitu¬ tion" or "imputation," all attempts to evade law or amend law, would come to nought. This volume is addressed to those who do not and cannot find rest in priestly systems; and to some, whose faith is still unsettled, it may suggest one that at least thoroughly satisfies the author.</page><page sequence="44">38 MR. chapman's publications.

By and through An¬ drew Jackson Davis. 2 vols., 8vo, cloth, 18s. This is a work of unprecedented character and pretensions. It consists, professedly, of the consecutive revelations and reasonings of a spirit freed by a process, the philosophy of which is explained, from the obstructing influence of the material organization, and exalted to a position which gave access to a knowledge of the structure and laws of the whole material and spiritual universe. It appears in the form of a verbatim report of the utterances of the clairvoy¬ ant, who spoke only as directed by his own internal prompt¬ ings, without any suggestions or interrogations from those around him. He is described as a youth of a mild disposi¬ tion, pure life, and of harmonious mental development, but nevertheless ignorant and illiterate, possessing absolutely no knowledge of the subjects with which, in his peculiar abnormal condition, he displays such an intimate and com¬ prehensive acquaintance. Testimony in evidence of such an extraordinary origin is furnished in the Preface and Introduction. The book may be divided into two portions—one consist¬ ing of declarations concerning subjects and objects which we have no means of absolutely verifying, comprehending statements in reference to the heavenly bodies, to the inhab¬ itants of various planets of our solar system, to the conditions and modes of existence in a future state, to the ethnography of our earth long anterior to the date of any tradition or historical record, and to many other phenomena too nume¬ rous to name here;—the other relating to scientific, philo¬ sophical, mythological, theological, moral, and social ques¬ tions, which are within the reach of the ordinary compass of hiunan faculties and knowledge. Hence, after stripping the book of all its claims to an extraordinary origin, and of all the parts which are beyond</page><page sequence="45">"memoir of fichte." 39 the reach of verification, there still remains a work of no ordinary scientific and theological pretensions. The first Part, designated the "Key," unfolds this funda¬ mental idea of " Spiritual Causation" or belief in the reality of spirit, as constituting a substratum and cause of all phe¬ nomena. The second Part enters upon the formation of the uni¬ verse, including our Solar System. The origin and geolo¬ gical history of the earth is described with a minuteness which evinces an intimate knowledge of the various physical sciences, and a comprehensive acquaintance with the whole subject in all its details and technicalities. This is followed by accounts of the early geography of our planet, and the origin and migrations of Man, the origin of language, of mythological theology, and of creeds and institutions that have no foundation in Nature. The Old and New Testa¬ ments are included in this survey, together with the great moral and religious teachers of different ages and nations. The remaining sections are occupied with the phenomena of death, and the mode of existence in a future life. The third and last Part of the work consists of a descrip¬ tion of Society as it now exists, showing how the interest of every man is opposed to that of his neighbour; how the poor are oppressed, and the labourer lives unrewarded; how the mechanic and the tiller of the soil feel no interest in the production of their labour beyond the paltry sum given for the toil; how the tradesmen are engaged in isolated pursuits diametrically opposed to each other; how the lawyer's in¬ terest is opposed to general peace and righteousness; how the physician's interest consists in the amount of organic violation that occurs ; how the interests of the clergy con¬ sist in the prevalence of ignorance on psychological subjects; and thus, throughout the whole social circle, how mutual opposition and selfishness prevail. This is followed by a number of practical precepts and remedial measures, the latter of which are only to be realized by associative efforts. FICHTE (J. G.)—MEMOIR OF JOHANN GOT¬ TLIEB FICHTE.

In addition to the usual information expected in a Biogra¬ phy, this work contains incidental notices of the system of</page><page sequence="46">40 MR. chapman's publications. philosophy promulgated by Fichte under the title of the " Wissenschaftslehre;" and traces the development, under circumstances of peculiar difficulty, of that noble, impres¬ sive, and strongly marked character which is thus described by Mr. Carlyle in his admirable essay on the state of Ger¬ man Literature, when rebutting the charge of mysticism preferred against the philosophers of Germany:—" But above all, the mysticism of Fichte might astonish us. The cold, colossal, adamantine spirit, standing erect and clear, like a Cato Major among degenerate men; fit to have been the teacher of the Stoa, and to have discoursed of beauty and virtue in the groves of Academe! Our reader has seen some words of Fichte: are these like words of a mystic We state Fichte's character as it is known and admitted by men of all parties among the Germans, when we say that so robust an intellect, a soul so calm, so lofty, massive, and immoveable, has not mingled in philosophical discussion since the time of Luther. We figure his motionless look, had he heard this charge of mysticism! For the man rises before us, amid contradiction and debate, like a granite mountain amid clouds and wind. Ridicule, of the best that could be commanded, has been already tried against him; but it could not avail. What was the wit of a thousand wits to him The cry of a thousand choughs assaulting that old cliff of granite ; seen from the summit, these, as they winged the midway air, showed scarce so gross as beetles, and their cry was seldom even audible. Fichte's opinions may be true or false; but his character as a thinker can be slightly valued only by such as know it ill; and as a man, approved by action and suffering, in his life and in his death, he ranks with a class of men who were common only in better ages than ours."—State of German Literature, by Thomas Carlyle. THE VOCATION OF THE SCHOLAR. By Johann Gottlieb Fichte. Translated from the German, by William Smith. Post 8vo, cloth, 2s.; paper cover, Is. 6d. In these Lectures, delivered at Jena in 1794, Fichte sets forth, with that energy of thought and fervency of style which are his peculiar characteristics, the Vocation of Man as an Individual, and as a Member of Society; the sources of the different Classes into which Society is divided, and</page><page sequence="47">"the nature of the scholar." 41 the duties arising from these distinctions; and lastly, the Vocation of that particular Class whose separate calling has its origin in the common desire of man to hnoio, and who have chosen the acquisition and imparting of knowledge as their share in the general labours of the race;—assigning the duties of the Scholar, as the Teacher and Guide of Mankind, the highest place among the varied forms of human activity; and to the Scholar himself, in so far as he worthily fulfils these duties, the most honourable place in human society. The fundamental principle of this doc¬ trine, which places the true Vocation of Man in the con¬ tinual advancement of culture, is illustrated by contrast in an examination of Rousseau's celebrated paradox concerning the influence of Art and Science on the well-being of Man. ON THE NATURE OF THE SCHOLAR, AND ITS MANIFESTATIONS. By Joiiann Gottlieb Fichte. Translated from the German, by Wil¬ liam Smith. Second Edition. Post 8vo, cloth, 3s. 6d. In this work the Scholar is represented as he who, pos¬ sessed and actuated by the Divine Idea, labours to create for that Idea an outward manifestation in the World, either by cultivating in his fellow-men the capacity for its recep¬ tion (as Teacher); or by directly embodying it in visible forms (as Artist, Ruler, Lawgiver, etc.). Mr. Carlyle has described Fichte's mode of treating this theme with pecu¬ liar force, insight, and truth, in his lectures on ' Heroes and Hero-Worship' in the following terms :— "Fichte, the German philosopher, delivered, some forty years ago, at Erlangen, a highly remarkable course of lec¬ tures on this subject: 'Ueber das Wesen des Gelehrten (on the Nature of the Literary Man).' Fichte, in conformity with the transcendental Philosophy, of which he was a distin¬ guished teacher, declares, first: That all things which we see or work with on this earth, especially we ourselves and all persons, are as a kind of vesture or sensuous appearance: that under all there lies, as the essence of them, what he calls the ' Divine Idea of the World;' this is the reality which ' lies at the bottom of all appearance.' To the mass of men no such divine idea is recognizable in the world; they live, merely, says Fichte, among the superficialities,</page><page sequence="48">42 mr. chapman's publications. practicalities, and shows of the world, not dreaming that there is anything divine under them. But the man of letters is sent hither specially that he may discern for himself, and make manifest itself in a newr dialect; and he is there for the purpose of doing that. Such is Fichte's phraseology; with which we need not quarrel. It is his way of naming what I here, by other words, am striving imperfectly to name; what there is at present no name for; the unspeak¬ able Divine Significance, full of splendour, of wonder and terror, that lies in the being of every man, of everything— the presence of the God who made every man and thing. " Fichte calls the man of letters, therefore, a prophet, or, as he prefers to phrase it, a priest, continually unfolding the godlike to men. Men of letters are a perpetual priesthood, from age to age, teaching all men that a God is still present in their life; ' that all appearance,' whatsoever we see in the world, is but as a vesture of the ' Divine Idea of the World,' for ' that wdiich lies at the bottom of appearance.' In the true literary man there is thus ever, acknowledged or not by the worid, a sacredness: he is the light of the wrorld; the world's priest;—guiding it, like a sacred pillar of fire, in its dark pilgrimage through the waste of time. Fichte discriminates with sharp zeal the true literary man, what we here call the hero as man of letters, from multitudes of false un-heroic. Fichte even calls him elsewhere a ' nonentity,' and has in short no mercy for him, no wish that he should continue happy among us! This is Fichte's notion of the man of letters. It means, in its own form, precisely what we here mean."—Heroes and Hero-Worship, by Thomas Carlyle. THE VOCATION OF MAN. By Johann Gottlieb Ficiite. Translated from the German, by William Smith. Post 8vo, cloth, 4s. 6d. In this interesting work, all the great phases of metaphysical speculation are condensed, with admirable lucidity and com¬ prehensiveness, into an almost dramatic picture of the suc¬ cessive developments of an individual mind. It contains the most systematic exposition of Fichte's philosophy which could be presented in a popular form; and he himself says that he has here "taken a deeper glance into Religion" than ever he did before. After carrying his representative Ego through the various stages of sensuous perception,</page><page sequence="49">"characteristics of the present age." 43 doubt, mere intellectual knowledge, and absolute Scepti¬ cism or unbelief, he proceeds, by a deeper analysis of the fact of consciousness, to lay the foundation of a Higher Faith on that innate feeling of inferiority, dependence, and derivation, underlying both our emotional and intellectual nature, which, in its relation to the one, gives birth to the Religious Sentiments, and, wdien recognized and elaborated by the other, becomes the basis of a scientific belief in the Absolute, or God,—the materials of the edifice being fur¬ nished by our intuitions of the Good, the Beautiful, and the True. By thus raising our Faith in the Divine from the rank of a mere inference of the Understanding, to that of a direct intuition of reason, the chasm is again bridged over by which analysis had formerly separated Reason from the simple Faith of common humanity; consciousness becomes the manifestation or self-revelation of the Absolute, and the Absolute itself the ground and substance of the pheno¬ mena of Consciousness, which, no longer a purely subjective and empty train of fancies, is now seen to contain nothing which does not rest upon and image forth a Higher and Infinite Reality; and thus Idealism itself becomes a sub¬ lime and Absolute Realism. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PRESENT AGE. By Johann Gottlieb Fichte. Translated from the German, by William Smith. Post 8vo, cloth, 7s. Tnis work is the application of the leading principles laid down in the 'Nature of the Scholar' to the subject of the Philosophy of History. From the consideration of the Individual and Social relations of men, Fichte now proceeds to the wider field of the History of the Progress of the Human Race. Setting out from the principle that there is a Plan in the Divine Government of the World, and that this Plan is recognizable by the human mind, he lays down, as the fundamental Idea of this World-Plan, and therefore as the End of the Life of Mankind on Earth, that the Race shall, in this life, order all their relations with Freedom according to Reason. The Life of Mankind on Earth is divided, with reference to this fundamental idea, into Five Epochs. I. The Epoch of Reason as Instinct. II. The Epoch of Reason as Instinct changed into an External Ruling Authority. III. The Epoch of Liberation from this</page><page sequence="50">44 MR. chapman's publications. Outward Authority. IV The Epoch of Reason as Science. V. The Epoch of Reason as Art. Briefly but comprehen¬ sively tracing the progress of the Race through the first and second of these Epochs, and assigning to the Present Age its place in the third, he proceeds to the delineation of its more prominent Characteristics, hi contrast with the Life according to Reason, passing it under review in the several aspects of Science, Art, the Social Relations of Men, Morality, and Religion. In his strictures on the multiform degeneracies of his Age, Fichte maintains throughout the character of a clear-sighted, rigorous, and austere censor, delivering, as from a lofty judgment-seat, the stern but salu¬ tary lessons of a sublime morality. THE WAY TOWARDS THE BLESSED LIFE; Or, The Doctrine of Religion. By Johann G. Fichte. Translated by William Smith. Post 8vo, cloth, 6s. In this work Fichte approaches the highest theme of human contemplation. The same great ideas which in the 'Nature of the Scholar' were applied to the delineation of a parti¬ cular phase of human activity in the Individual, and in the ' Characteristics of the Present Age' to the elucidation of the Earthly Life of Mankind as a Race, are here still further developed by their application to the Science of Universal Being, and in making manifest the sure foundations of Religion, deeply rooted in a profound Ontology. The True Life or Being is sharply discriminated, both in its essence and its manifestations, from mere Apparent Life or Being; and the identity of the Doctrine of an Eternal and only Blessed Life, as revealed by Philosophy, and that taught by Christianity, is established. This Idea is realized by an Analysis of the highest elements of Ontology, in which True Being, which is One and Simple in its essential nature, is followed out to its necessary Manifestation in Consciousness as a Manifold Existence genetically reposing on its Un¬ changeable and Eternal Original, in union with which its True Blessedness consists. With this separation of the One Primitive Divine Being into a Manifold and Conscious Existence, there arises, in our conception, a similar division of the world, with reference to its form, into a world of infinite multiplicity and change. In our reflection on this</page><page sequence="51">THE DOCTRINE OF RELIGION. world we recognize five different modes of viewing it and its relations to ourselves, viz.—the first, or lowest, being that of the prevalent philosophy, in which reality is attributed to the Sensuous World, or Nature :—the second, in which reality is placed in a Law of Order in the existing world, addressed to Freedom; the Standing-point of Objective Legality or of the Categorical Imperative:—the third, which places the same reality in a new Creative Law, addressed to Freedom within the Existing World; the Standing-point of the Higher Morality :—the fourth, wdiich places reality in God alone, and in his manifested Existence; the Standing-point of Religion:---and the fifth, which clearly discerns the Mani¬ fold in its outgoings from the One Reality; the Standing- point of Science. True Religion, however, is not possible as a mere view, but exists only in union with an Actual Divine Life. After a detailed proof that the doctrine here set forth regarding the Divine or Blessed Life, is also the doctrine of pure Christianity as taught by the Jesus of John's Gospel, and an explanation of the distinction between the Historical and the Metaphysical in Christianity, the author proceeds to an exposition of the possible modes of Man's Enjoyment of the World, founded on the previously enu¬ merated modes of viewing it which have arisen in reflection. Such an exposition is necessary to demonstrate the Blessed¬ ness of the Religious Life. In the course of this exposition he passes in review the affections and motives which are called into play by the view of the world from the five dif¬ ferent standing-points; introducing a critique of Stoicism and its principles; an exposition of the true nature of Free¬ dom ; a delineation of the New World created by the Higher Morality within the World of Sense, as the immediate Life of God in Time; and, finally, a comprehensive survey of the whole subject from the ultimate Standing-point of Religion (that of Science being here excluded), from Avhich Love is ..regarded as the creator of the abstract conception of God; as the source of all certainty; as that which alone in Life embraces the Absolute in its conception; as that by which Reflection is extended into an Actual Infinity; and, lastly, as the Source of Science. The work concludes with a deli¬ neation of the Blessed Life as exemplified in that of the Moral-Religious Man.</page><page sequence="52">46 MR. chapman's publications.

The first lecture is a state¬ ment of the evils of Competition in Trade, and the second is intended to point out its falsehood and injustice as a regu¬ lator of the reward of labour. The third and fourth lectures embrace the subject of Poor-laws, a statement of the prin¬ ciples on which pauper labour should be organized, and a sketch of the attempts made in this country and on the continent to suppress able-bodied pauperism by providing employment. The fifth lecture is an inquiry into the right to private property in Land, the principles on wdiich land should be held, and the advantages of both the large and small farm systems. The sixth lecture treats of Machinery, its present and future relations to the prosperity of the working classes. Lectures seven and eight treat of the principle of Association, showing how far it may legitimately come within the province of the state, and how far it is the interest and the duty of individuals. The Lectures are fol¬ lowed by a copious Appendix, illustrative of the subject- matter of the lectures, including a reply to the objections of Mazzini, and a view of the operation of the competitive principle upon the morals of trade. Notwithstanding the</page><page sequence="53">"the elements of individualism." 47 interest which Socialism has excited in this country, it would be difficult to name a single book on the subject, containing a clear and popular statement of those general principles on which the great bulk of its adherents are agreed. Socialism is not necessarily allied with any pecu¬ liar metaphysical doctrines, religious creeds, or irreligious antagonisms. But in the minds of the large majority of those who have not looked into the subject for themselves, Socialism has become identified with such special views, and, in consequence, has been the theme of endless abuse and misrepresentation. These considerations have been held a sufficient motive for the issuing of the present work, in wdiich Socialism is placed upon the neutral ground of political ethics and experiment. MACCALL (W.)— THE ELEMENTS OF INDI¬ VIDUALISM. A Series of Lectures. By Wil¬ liam Maccall. Post 8vo, cloth, 7s. 6d. Each man has certain qualities which all other human beings more or less possess: this constitutes his Manhood. Each man, moreover, has certain peculiarities, distinguishing him from all other human beings: this constitutes his Individu¬ ality. An Individual Man, therefore, has certain qualities in common with his fellow-men, along with certain others which are exclusively his own. Such is the doctrine of Individualism, expounded and applied in the Thirty-five Lectures of which this work con¬ sists. In the first four Lectures the author unfolds his " Confes¬ sion of Faith," "The Teacher's History," "The Teacher's Mission," and "The Mission of the Teacher's Brethren;" and then, in successive Lectures, he elucidates his principles, showing that the Unity of the Universe necessitates mfinite Multiformity in the Universe (v.), in Man (vi.), and in the Individual (vii.), and that that community is the happiest, holiest, and most beautiful where this law is most faithfully obeyed (viii.) ; that in the Individual the Divine and the Human are identical, not opposite, and that the more Human he is, the more Divine he is (ix.); that Religion is the</page><page sequence="54">48 MR. chapman's publications. yearning of the Human Spirit for more harmonious and joy¬ ous identity with the Spirit of Universal Being (x.) ; and that this yearning is most surely, speedily, and fully satisfied when the Individual is faithfullest to his Individual Nature (xi.) ; that every Individual best helps all others to develope their Individuality, by most perfectly developing his own; and that Morality is thus simply that fidelity to our Nature in action, wdiich Religion is in consciousness (xii.) ; that every man, in proportion as he developes his own Individuality, will be more desirous that other men should develope theirs, which is true Tolerance (xiii.) ; that the Revelations of Grod are perpetual, and that the nature of every Individual is the highest of all Revelations to himself (xiv.) ; and not there¬ fore to be interpreted by sacred boohs, but sacred books by it (xv.) ; that the Teacher, or Reformer, or Prophet, at what¬ ever time he may appear, does not so much utter new truths as proclaim the Great Unspoken Want of the Age, which has been, with growing but unconscious force, fermenting in all hearts (xvi.) ; that a Church best fulfils its functions by progressively embodying, in as large a measure as possi¬ ble, the different elements of Human Nature (xvii.), and a Government its functions by harmonizing in the largest de¬ gree, and evolving the vitality of all the various conflicting interests, tendencies, opinions, and activities of the commu¬ nity (xviii.) ; that National Education can only be a national blessing, in as far as it recognizes the claims and developea the powers of the Individual (xix.) ; that the Past should be regarded as the Preparation of the Present, and the Guide of the Future, but not the Model for either (xx.) ; that Society developes one principle of Human Nature after another (xxi.) ; that in the Individual likewise the faculties are successively developed (xxii.), so as to combine into a beautiful and harmonious whole; that Nations also have their successive developments and missions (xxiii.) ; that Art is necessary to Education (xxiv.) ; that Truth should be expounded in its Positive aspects (xxv.) ; that Institutions, etc., should be estimated, not by the Understanding merely, but by our entire Individuality (xxvi.) ; that the value of Opinions and Faiths consists in their suitableness to the Indi¬ viduality of the Individual (xxvii.) ; that every man, as the Child of Infinitude, is both better and worse than he seems (xxviii.) ; that every man is good in proportion as he mani¬ fests the Spirit of Love, and great in proportion as he mani¬ fests the Spirit of Sacrifice (xxix.); that the Good, the</page><page sequence="55">"the agents of civilization." 49 True, and the Beautiful, which constitute the Human Trinity, should be harmoniously cultivated in the Indi¬ vidual and in Humanity (xxx.) ; that sects and parties are, at best, merely instruments of Truth and Progress, and as such should always be regarded and used as subordinate to the end for wdiich they exist (xxxi.) ; that the grand obstacle to the development of Individuality, as well as to the spread of the doctrine, is Conventionalism (xxxii.) ; that the greatest truths have had the feeblest beginnings (xxxiii.) ; but that all obstacles can be vanquished by the Power of Enthusiasm on the part of the Prophet and his Disciples (xxxiv.). The last Lecture (xxxv.) gives utterance to " the final, fervent, and familiar Word." "This book," says the author, "is not for critics, but for those deep and earnest souls who have sinned, suffered, struggled, and doubted much, but yet have yearned with a great yearning for holiness, truth, and faith." MACCALL (W.)— THE AGENTS OF CIVILI¬ ZATION. A Series of Lectures. By William Maccall. 12mo, cloth, 3s. 6d. The Introductory Lecture is on the characteristics of the Present Age, and on the causes which contribute to advance or modify modern Civilization. The succeeding Lectures may be described as giving the Natural History or Philosophy of Civilization. Starting from the first rude elements of social existence, the lecturer traces the rise and progress of the various agents who have brought society to its present position, defines their charac¬ ter and relations, and analyses then' influence. In this spirit he depicts the Hero, or Representative of Human Strength (Lect. ii.) ; the Poet, or Representative of Human Fancy (hi.) ; the Priest, or Representative of Human Au¬ thority (iv.) ; the Artist, or Representative of Human Grace (v.) ; the Prophet, or Representative of Moral Power (vi.) ; the Philosopher, or Representative of Intellectual Power (vii.) ; the Apostle, who is not any of these agents singly, but the Representative of that portion of them all which can be popularly expounded and applied (viii.) ; and lastly, the</page><page sequence="56">50 MR. chapman's publications. Martyr, the Representative not of the Human, but of the Divine—the most God-like of all the labourers in the cause of Humanity (ix.). MACCALL (W.)—THE EDUCATION OF TASTE. A Series of Lectures. By William Maccall. 12mo, paper cover, 2s. 6d. Individuality has a progressive development, now exhibit¬ ing one phase, and now another, till at a ripe season of life the distinctive faculty mounts the vacant throne, and domi¬ nates and harmonizes the whole. The development of a man's individuality, and the expression of its successive phases at the time is the best service which he can render to society. (Lect. i.) Taste is not a capricious fancy or liking for a particidar class of objects ; for it requires an equdibrium of the facul¬ ties which is hostile to such likings. It is not a faculty, but that state of our faculties by which they can equally appreciate and equally enjoy whatever is presented to them. It is the individual in the completeness of his individuahty, who seeing feels, and feeling knows, and knowing enjoys, objects in their completeness. (Lect. h.) The culture of Taste is a branch of the culture of our entire individuahty; and in that respect is akin to Genius and Religion. (Lect. iii.) The modification which this idea of Taste will introduce into popular opinions on various subjects is strikingly shown in the succeeding Lectures on "Taste and Religion" (iv.) ; "Taste and Morality" (v.); "Taste and Politics" (vi.) ; "Taste and Manners" (vii.) ; the concluding Lecture (viii.) contains a synopsis and defence of the author's doctrines of Individualism.</page><page sequence="57">" THE PROGRESS OF THE INTELLECT." 51 MACKAY (R. W.)—THE PROGRESS OF THE INTELLECT, as exemplified in the Religious Development of the Greeks and Hebrews. By R. W. Mackay, M.A. 2 vols. 8vo, cloth, price 24s. The subjects comprised in this work, which is intended to be suggestive of new, and possibly more correct, viewrs in regard to matters of classical and biblical interest, are ar¬ ranged as follows:—A prehininary notice as to the nature of intellectual religion, its hindrances, aims, and instruments, is followed, in the first volume, by an attempt to present a general conception of "Ancient Wisdom," as applied to the three great topics of Nature, God, and Man; exemplified, as to the first of these, out of the Hebrew Cosmogony; in the second, principally from the mythology and philosophy of the Greeks ; in the third, from the views respectively taken by Hebrews and Greeks as to the great moral problem of the Divine relation to man, and the origin of evil. The second volume contains an analysis of various me¬ diatorial forms of religion,—those practical schemes wiiich have been adopted for restoring into harmony or union with Grod that imperfect human nature which the awakened con¬ sciousness had discovered to be estranged, corrupt, or " fal¬ len." Among the Greeks, as elsewdiere, we see the two prominent religious aspects, the active and the speculative, the heroic and the mystic forms, separated to a certain ex¬ tent in symbol and record, but tending to convergence. The specific form of mediation prevalent among the Hebrews, called the Messianic theory, was greatly affected by the views they held as to the Divine retribution, and as to im¬ mortality ; and the modifications it assumed from different shades of political or speculative opinion are exemplified in the constructions which appear to have been put by different classes of men upon the Messianic character of Jesus. In speaking of Christianity, the writer's aim has been to distinguish its essence, that which may be supposed to have been mainly contemplated by Jesus, from that wdiich is merely formal, adopted out of ancient or recent symbolism. In the concluding part, he has attempted to give a connected outline of the speculative or spiritual phase of Christianity, its origin and development. D 2</page><page sequence="58">52 MR. chapman's publications. The general design of the work is to glean a lesson from the past, in regard to the intellectual state and prospects of the present; to trace in the records of opinion, as exempli¬ fied in the religious development of ancient nations, that spirit of progress, which appears to be the distinguishing characteristic of rational beings. This progress, it will be seen, is a manifestation of the intellect. It is this which, from small beginnings, tends, in the course of education and civilization, to establish a use¬ ful control over the vague promptings of the senses and sentiments. For we feel before we learn to feel rightly; so that wdiile feeling remains nearly the same, remarkable changes occur in its direction and mode of expression. It is interesting to observe how, in the intellectual education of the world, hnagination becomes sobered by the growth of reason; how the husk of superstitious forms, necessary perhaps at first, but in time becoming an absolute incum¬ brance, is thrown aside by the advancing mind, until mytho¬ logy ripens into philosophy. The topics common to religion and philosophy, are God, Man, and Nature. These three, which undoubtedly are closely connected and illustrative of each other, were by early speculation confounded—God was mixed up with nature, and arrayed in human attributes. The results of these processes, issuing into an endless variety of symbols and legends, at first hesitatingly set forth, afterwards be¬ coming more distinct, as poetry and sculpture shaped them more plainly to the eye and to the memory, are not to be treated as matter of mere childish amusement, but as a serious lesson reflecting our own mental eccentricities and weakness. For since we can express only what wre know, and all human knowledge is imperfect, all human expression must be imperfect also, and mythi are only extreme instances of its inherent and inevitable defect, that of assigning to inward conceptions the character of external realities. Of such transformed conceptions, one of the most con¬ spicuous is that which represented the self-conscious defi¬ ciency and imperfection of human nature as a "Fall," fol¬ lowed by some scheme of reconciliation or redemption. A perfect Being, it was thought, must have created a perfect work, and man must originally have been innocent and happy. The aim of religion is to restore the original state; to reconcile man to God and to himself. Its remedial or mediatorial formulas vary with varieties of temperament and</page><page sequence="59">"the progress of the intellect." 53 civilization, and according to the theories entertained as to man's nature and God's retributory dealings. Some rely on moral effort, occasionally placing in the van of renovated humanity a pre-eminent hero who shall scale Olympus, or reahze an ideal kingdom; some, based on the more profound Oriental thought of an inevitable degradation of the spirit through association with the flesh, anticipate its deliverance by dreamy speculation or self-inflicted mortification. Yet, after all, the schemes for effacing the depravity of man, or in other words, of raising his condition, differ more in ap¬ pearance than reality. Socrates and Jesus inculcated the same aspiration, that of moral perfection, of being as good and wise as possible. St. Paul, with little more of mysticism than several ancient philosophies, extolled a spiritual mhid- edness, of which the type indeed was Jesus, but which requires to be engrafted into ourselves. All these methods of mediation, whether termed a new or spiritual life, the love of God, or the love of wisdom, which is "philosophy," blend and harmonize together. For they all strive after reunion with the primal source of truth and goodness; seeking not worldly pageantries, but the things beyond the world. All find their realization when, to the true external law contemplated by Jesus, is applied the spiritualized or cultivated intellect capable of comprehending and conform¬ ing to it; and though religion, so long as it remains formal and dogmatical, seems to be divorced from philosophy, the separation is but temporary, since the two are naturally united, and, indeed, are only varying aspects of one thing. But in order to read history aright, and to find in it a correct view of intellectual progress, we must not be content with the representations of those later compilers who coidd not attribute to their ancestors opinions differing from their own; we should question the independent indications of every age and school. It is demonstrable, for instance, that the Epic or Homeric mythology was by no means the earliest religion of Greece, but assumed its place in men's minds as a connected system only through the representations of the writers in which we now meet with it. So of the He¬ brew religion, it may easily be seen by a clear mind, that the best form of it was not the earliest, but the latest; that the God of Abraham and of Moses was a Being delighting in blood, who prescribed human sacrifices; that this Being wras not a strange God, but Jehovah himself; that at length, principally through the indignant remonstrances of the pro-</page><page sequence="60">54 MR. chapman's publications. phets, a reform took place, through which a minority of the people began to see, that the true Jehovah could never, un¬ less by way of penal infliction, have authorized so dreadful a practice; finally, we find Stephen and St. Paul, (the latter of whom, however, revived the Moloch symbol in reference to the crucified Jesus,) boldly declared that the sacred oracles, which were the pride of the Jews, had throughout been en¬ tirely misconceived and misinterpreted by them; and instead of those unaccountably recurring backslidings from sound rehgion suggested by a superficial view of the history, we find here, as elsewhere, a tolerably constant progress from grossness to spiritualism. Christianity, the last Jewish reform, adds perhaps little to wiiat has already been indicated by the great prophets ; but it makes all clearer, being the practical realization of wdiat they had but imperfectly conceived. The novelty involved in it became more clearly evident in the Pauline theory, which, partly based on the Spiritualism of Alexandria, partly on the Apostles' inward conviction of the powerlessness of human effort after perfect legal observance, and the conse¬ quent necessity of an imputed or imparted justification, first asserted for Christianity, considered as a new era hi human development, a substantive independent existence. How¬ ever, its two grand subdivisions, the Jew Christianity and the Pauline, though differing in form, essentially converge. Jesus proposed an exalted type of " righteousness" according to the true law written in the heart; Paul proclaimed a righteous disposition descended into the heart from Grod. In both systems, the problem of human deficiency is happily solved. The nightmare about the hereditary curse is dis¬ pelled, and man is reconciled. Yet human effort is not su¬ perseded; for although, from the phraseology employed, it might seem as if, through some external arrangement of the Deity, every purpose of Creation were, as the early Chris¬ tians imagined, already accomplished, we now find that wdiere superstition ends rehgion has to begin, and that Christianity is in fact only the commencement of a new cra? signalized by the achievement of an escape, circuitous perhaps but certain, from a false and noxious prepossession.</page><page sequence="61">"lectures on political economy." 55 NEWMAN (F. W.)—LECTURES ON POLITICAL ECONOMY. By Francis William Newman, Author of ' Phases of Faith/ ' History of the He¬ brew Monarchy/ etc. Post 8vo, cloth, 7s. 6d. These Lectures were originally delivered at the Ladies' College in Bedford-square. They are not only a popular exposition of the principles of Political Economy, but also present the writer's individual views on many of our so¬ cial evils and their remedies. The Lecturer is by no means a mere Economist, regarding the doctrines of his science as a panacea for the ills of society. He is careful to show that wealth, not being synonymous with well-being, Econo¬ mical science, which is but the theory of wealth, must be subordinate to Political; and that, though the statesman must not neglect the teachings of the Economist, his mea¬ sures must have as their primary object the moral rather than the financial interests of society. He also showrs that Economists have presupposed a degree of flexibility in hu¬ man powers, and of facility in the transference of capital, which does not exist; and that hence, in their rigid state¬ ment of consequences, they overlook many evils and diffi¬ culties, so as often to appear widely at variance with fact. The following is an indication of his views on some im¬ portant points. Competition is the necessary condition of buying and selling; and without it there can be no such thing as price. Blindness to this fact is the economic error of Sociahsts, who, if they succeeded in organizing great Social Families, would still find competition inevitable beyond the hmits of the Family, unless they renounced foreign traffic, which would be absurd. Socialists also err morally in speaking as if a man's duties were ahke towards all mankind, and in undervaluing the difficulty of subduing selfishness; while they err politically in not seeing that a community, if men were free to choose their occupations, would break asunder from their rival preferences, or if it were subjected to the disposition of a single mind, would sink into apathetic stu¬ pidity. (Lect. i.) The doctrine of Malthus, that Population has a tendency to increase faster than Capital, is undeniably true, since it is demonstrable that the population of Great Britain and Ireland alone, if it doubled every forty years, would in</page><page sequence="62">56 MR. chapman's publications. 1080 years cover the globe, so that each individual would have no more than a square foot of ground to stand on. But every practical application of the above doctrine by Malthus and his followers is perniciously false. The ex¬ ample of Ireland proves that the absence of Poor Laws has no tendency to check population; and if the good were per¬ suaded to become Malthusians, the only result would be that the bad would quickly outbreed them. The proper checks to over-population will grow out of a general advance in well-being and refinement. Moreover, excessive population is not the source of our economic difficulties, but rather that ignorance and want of versatility in workmen which prevent them from quitting an old trade, when it is over¬ stocked through the increased efficiency given to human labour by the invention of machinery, etc. This wrant of versatility should be remedied by a thorough industrial education of the people, together with the enacting of laws to forbid the premature and excessive work of young people. The absolute ownership of land by individuals is a viola¬ tion of natural right; the State, as the representative of the Community, being the legitimate proprietor of the sod, wdiich it is bound to dispose of for the general good. Under the feudal system, lands were held by the Barons as a trust bestowed by the State, on condition of their rendering cer¬ tain public services; and rent was paid to them as an ac- knowdedgment of protection. By the gradual, alienation of the Crown estates and the exemption of landholders from feudal service, this old feudal theory was merged in the com¬ mercial idea of land, as a thing to be bought and sold like other commodities. Land being the gift of nature to the whole race of man, and not the product of human labour, any claim to its possession on the part of an individual must give way before the needs of the community, a rea¬ sonable indemnity being offered, just as, in a state of siege, a private well is seized for public use, the owner being in¬ demnified, not for the water, but for the expense of his well. In fact, more than this principle is already acted on in the case of canals, railways, etc., landholders being com¬ pelled to renounce possession simply on the ground of pub¬ lic convenience. Certain reforms in the proprietorship and tenure of land wroidd go far to remedy many of our social evils: for example, such a measure for Ireland as once saved Prussia—the converting of its cottier tenants into proprie¬ tors ; or, at least, the compelling every landholder to sell to every cottier on his estate who desired it, a small portion of</page><page sequence="63">"the laws of man's nature," etc. 57 land: in England, extensive home colonization, an increase hi the number of small freeholds, greater fixity of tenure for the farmers, the introduction of a modified metayer system, by wdiich the labourer might become a sharer in the produce; the imposing of a legal limit on landed incum¬ brances, etc. But the grand desideratum, alone capable of re¬ covering us from our present disorganized condition, is the restoration of Local Rights, which would create a sphere for the ambition and intelligence of the provincial popula¬ tion, and establish between inhabitants of the same district those moral relations necessary to a healthy state of society. The functions of the central Government should be restricted to purposes purely national, and there should be local legis¬ latures which would manage all the affairs of their own dis¬ trict or township, with a reservation of appeal, in special cases, to the Imperial Parliament. Such a change in our system would furnish the means for that practical education of the people which will best tend to give them character and purpose, and, with increased leisure and means of cul¬ ture, will help to annihdate the antipathy between the pa¬ trician nature and the plebeian. Every legal encourage¬ ment should be given to adoption, by which destitute chil¬ dren might have secured to them the influence of domestic- ties, instead of being turned out on the world after regi¬ mental training in orphan asylums. The above are some of the writer's special views; but the bulk of the work consists of a brief, clear, and interesting exposition of the subjects strictly comprised under Political Economy,—the definition of Private Property, the nature of Capital, Profits, and Wages, the theory of Rent, Tithes, Taxes, etc. ATKINSON AND MARTINEAU.—LETTERS ON THE LAWS OF MAN'S NATURE AND DE- • VELOPMENT. By H. G. Atkinson and Har¬ riet Martineau. Post 8vo, cloth, 9s. This correspondence was set on foot by Miss Martineau, in order to elicit the views and experience of Mr. Atkin¬ son, who, to scientific knowledge and philosophic aims, unites an extensive acquaintance with mesmeric phenomena. d 3</page><page sequence="64">58 mr. chapman's publications. Miss Martineau's letters amount to no more than a fourth of the entire matter, and consist chiefly of preconcerted questions and illustrative anecdotes, given in her well- known clear and spirited style. The design of the work is to invite the attention of scientific and philosophic inquirers to a comparatively unexplored region of phenomena hi the constitution of man; to record the most striking points in the experience of an observer who has had peculiar oppor¬ tunities of research in that region, the facts he believes himself to have discovered and the speculations they have suggested; and to indicate the bearing of these subjects on the actual condition and future prospect of our race. Mr. Atkinson is an ardent disciple of Bacon, and, in com¬ mon with well-knowTi writers, urges the vital importance to human progress of applying the inductive method to the study of mental philosophy. He holds that the human mind is no exception to that submission to the law of cause and effect, or invariable sequence, which is recognized as the basis of science in every other department of inquiry; and that, since we know nothing of mind apart from organization, the primary source of a sound theory of man's nature must be the observation of the material conditions which precede and accompany the various mental phenomena. Of these material conditions, the constitution of the brain is the imme¬ diate one and the most important. According to the writer, the researches of Gall have proved (what is in thorough analogy Avith Sir C. Bell's discovery, that motion and sensi¬ bility have distinct nervous media) that the different parts of the brain have specific functions, constituting the various mental manifestations; so that a true mental philosophy must comprise, and have as its basis, a correct physiology of the brain. But while thus convinced that the discoveries of Gall rested on an unshaken foundation, Mr. Atkinson felt that they left, as might have been anticipated, much to desire towards a complete theory of mind; and hence he regarded an expansion of the phrenological system, afforded by the phenomena of mesmerism, as having much antecedent pro- babUity hi its favour. In his extensive practice of mes¬ merism, as a curative agent, he believes himself to have seen not only the strongest confirmation of the principles of phrenology generally, but also evidence to establish the existence of a constant relation between certain sensational and intellectual manifestations and portions of the brain not previously specified or included in the phrenological</page><page sequence="65">"the lawts of man's nature," etc. 59 classification. One of the most remarkable powders exhi¬ bited by certain somnambules is that of introverting their perception, so as to recognize the structure and function of the various parts of the brain, and also that of calling any organ into activity at will. In two letters on the organic arrangement of the brain, the writer gives the results he has obtained by putting the above powers into requisition in a peculiarly gifted patient, as well as by other methods of observation; which results, he considers, taken in con¬ nection with the phrenological facts previously ascertained, " present a remarkable show of consistent relations." Of these results the most important are, that the cerebellum contains the organs of muscular motion and force, that it is the seat of sensibility to boddy pains and pleasures, tempe¬ rature, etc., and that it has a special connection with all the physical and vital functions; that there are organs for the Arrangement of Ideas, the Love of Industry, the desire for Permanent Union or Marriage, for what Mr. Atkinson calls the Eye of the Mind, or intuitive power, for Conscious¬ ness and for Will, the three last being inner convolutions lying beneath Benevolence, Veneration, and Firmness. Suc¬ ceeding letters contain facts and observations illustrative of the nature and action of the senses and of the nervous sys¬ tem generally, consisting chiefly of singular phenomena oc¬ curring in the writer's experience as a mesmeriser; amongst others, the case of a ladjr blind from her birth, who sees in her sleep; considerations on the Association of Ideas, the Sense of Identity, Ghost-seeing, etc.; and Speculations on the nature of Light. In connection with the above subjects, Mr. Atkinson de¬ velopes his ideas concerning the relation of mind and matter, the origin and destination of man, and the idea of God; and he animadverts both on prevalent theological beliefs and on social practices. According to him, the datum, which alone gives value to observation and renders reasoning possible, is the recognition of the permanence of law—that like causes always produce hke effects: if any element were an excep¬ tion to this position, it would thereby be excluded from the sphere of science, and its investigation would be useless. Mind and matter are terms expressive of a distinction which is merely relative, and dependent on the imperfection of our knowledge; we know nothing of the essence of either, and all we do know exhibits what we call matter as the antecedent and cause of mind. Man is simply the highest organization</page><page sequence="66">60 MR. chapman's publications. on the earth, a further development of those tendencies in nature wdiich are exhibited in the lower species—his mind a more complete reflection of objective nature. To attain the highest state compatible with the limitations of his being, he must study those material conditions of which alone he is cognizant as causes, not substituting for these a supposed spiritual cause, which is a mere phantasm, the projection of his own limited nature. Man is a phenomenon among phe¬ nomena, and can know nothing of real causes ; the true prin¬ ciple which lies at the foundation of phenomena must ever be hidden from him, and to speculate upon it is a wTaste of energy and a diversion of the mental powers from their right occupation. The true object for all the faculties of man is to be found on this earth, which appears to have reached in him the term of its organic development; nor is there any just reason to conclude that he has a destination to another state of being. All theologies, therefore, are baseless, since they profess to give an account of that which lies as it were outside of the human mind and beyond the sphere of its fa¬ culties. They are useless as a foundation of morals ; good¬ ness and virtue, in their true sense, being facts in nature, as much as the vital influence of oxygen or the beauty and fra¬ grance of flowers, and being dependent on those impulses in man wliich are to be evolved solely by the regulation of his material condition in obedience to the dictates of nature. To argue from the action of the human intellect or sentiments to the nature of the primary cause can only issue hi a species of spiritual anthropomorphism, and is more calculated to shock than to ehcit the reverence of a cultivated mind. The writer, however, states that he " reposes on the deep and solemn conviction of an eternal and necessary cause,—such a cause as that, with our faculties, wre could not see and live." (P. 241). In the Appendix to this work there is much valuable and curious dlustrative quotation. THE PURPOSE OF EXISTENCE. Popularly con¬ sidered, in relation to the Origin, Development, and Destiny of the Human Mind. Crown 8vo, cloth, 7s. 6d. The object of this work is threefold. In the first place,</page><page sequence="67">"the purpose of existence." 61 it proposes to show the purpose for wdiich man exists; secondly, the reason why he has hitherto failed to accom¬ plish it; and thirdly, the way by which it may be attained. The positions which it endeavours to establish in the first Part are:—That the universe consists of two parts, Spirit and Body—the moving powrer and the moved body; that, for the development of spirit, matter is employed in various forms,—first of inorganic, and then of organic structure; that through a succession of these forms, in vegetable and animal order, spirit is at length brought into man; that the human frame is furnished with external organs, by means of which the objects of sense make their impressions on a system of internal nerves, which receive and convey them in endless variety to the brain; and that these impressions evolve a regidar order of expanding facidties, subservient and conducive to the progress of spirit to a higher state (ch. i.-vii.). The successive orders of faculties thus evolved are:—1st, the receptive, or those which receive impressions through the senses, viz. Consciousness (ch. viii.), Perception (ch. ix.), Observation (ch. x.), and Combination (ch. xi.) ; 2nd, reten¬ tive, or those which retain the impressions so received, viz. Memory (ch. xii.), and Inference (ch. xiii.) ; and, 3rd, abstrac¬ tive, or those which abstract or withdraw the mind from present facts, to work up the stored treasure of impressions or ideas into new forms, viz. Reflection (ch. xiv.), Imagina¬ tion (ch. xv.), and Reason (ch. xvi.-xix.). The second Part answers the question: " Has man accom¬ plished the purpose of his being?"

SMITH (J. S.)— SOCIAL ASPECTS. By John Stores Smith, Author of 'Mirabeau, a Life His¬ tory/ Post 8vo, cloth, price 6s. The cause of all national decay, as of all national prosperity, originates in the social condition of the people themselves; and therefore social reform should go hand, in hand with political reform (ch. i.). Impressed with this conviction, the author surveys the phenomena of social life, descanting on the social and domestic tendencies of the age (ch. ii.) ; on its moral health (ch. iii.) ; on the education and position of woman (ch. iv.) ; on the aristocracy of Mammon (ch. v.) ; on association and moral mechanism (ch. vi ; on literature (ch. vii), and on the duties and true vocation of the literary man (ch. viii.) ; and lastly, on the spiritual aspects of the times,—the great root of which these symptoms, social, do¬ mestic, moral, and intellectual, are but the folious develop¬ ment (ch. ix.). SPENCER (H.)—SOCIAL STATICS; Or, the Con¬ ditions Essential to PIuman Happiness Speci¬ fied, and the First of them Developed. By Herbert Spencer. 8vo, cloth, 12s. Setting out with the belief that a true system of Ethics must be one rigorously deduced from some self-evident first principle, Mr. Spencer preludes his inquiry by showing that none of the existing systems are so deduced. He argues that the Expediency-theory is the reverse of scientific, see¬ ing that what it takes for a first principle is not an axiom, but the problem to be solved. We do not want to know that "Greatest Happiness" is the thing to be achieved: we want to know how " Greatest Happiness" may be achieved. On this point, however, the disciples of Paley and Bentham give us nothing but opinions, and not rules logically in¬ ferred from some necessary truth. If we are left to follow our own judgments, unguided by any system of positive de¬ ductions, to say that we should do what is " expedient" is to say that we should do what we think we should do!</page><page sequence="69">"social statics." 63 In commenting upon the Moral Sense doctrine, Mr. Spencer assigns various reasons for concluding that there exists some faculty "whose duty it is to dictate rectitude in our transactions with each other;" but he asserts that Shaftesbury and his followers have erred in supposing this faculty " to be capable of intuitively solving every ethical problem submitted to it." He proceeds to show that only its fundamental intuition is trustworthy, and that it remains for the intellect to logically unfold its intuitions into a sy¬ stematic morality. Drawing an analogy between the moral sense and that geometric sense, as we may call it, by which we apprehend the ground truths of mathematics, he argues that " as it is the office of the geometric sense to originate a geometric axiom, from which reason may deduce a scien¬ tific geometry, so it is the office of the moral sense to ori¬ ginate a moral axiom from which reason may develope a scientific morality." The constructive part of his work Mr. Spencer com¬ mences by defining morality as "the law of the perfect man—the law in obedience to which perfection consists;" and hence he argues, that " a system of pure ethics cannot recognize evd, or any of those conditions which evil gene¬ rates." "It knows no such thing as an infraction of the lawrs, for it is merely a statement of what the laws are." To all questions which presuppose some antecedent unlawful action, morality can give no reply, because it does not recognize the premises. " The question, What are the right principles of human conduct is one thing; the question, What must be done when these principles have been broken through is another and widely different thing." And Mr. Spencer points out that moralists are in error in treating of them as parts of one science. In his next chapter the author aims to prove, that the ultimate fulfilment of this perfect law is inevitable; and that, in its essence, civilization is the acquirement by man¬ kind of the ability to fulfil it. "All evil," he says, "re¬ sults from the non-adaptation of constitution to conditions;" and he maintains that, " in virtue of an essential principle of life, this non-adaptation is ever being rectified." The truth of these twro propositions he variously dlustrates; and sums up his argument on the "evanescence of evil" thus,— " All imperfection is unfitness to the conditions of ex¬ istence." " This unfitness must consist, either in having a faculty</page><page sequence="70">G4 MR. chapman's publications. or faculties in excess; or in having a faculty or faculties deficient; or in both." " A faculty in excess is one which the conditions of exist¬ ence do not afford full exercise to; and a faculty that is deficient is one from which the conditions of existence de¬ mand more than it can perform." " But it is an essential principle of life that a faculty to which circumstances do not allow full exercise diminishes; and that a faculty on which circumstances make excessive demands increases." " And so long as this excess and this deficiency continue, there must continue decrease on the one hand and growth on the other." " Finally, all excess and all deficiency must disappear: that is, all unfitness must disappear; that is, all imperfec¬ tion must disappear." Treating next of " the Divine Idea and the Conditions of its Realization," Mr. Spencer says that, had Bentham simply assumed " greatest happiness" to be the creative purpose, his position would have been tenable; but that he erred in assuming greatest happiness to be the immediate aim of man. " It is for us to ascertain the conditions, by conform¬ ing to which this greatest happiness may be attained ;—not to put trust in guesses, not to do this or that because we think it whT be beneficial, but to find out what really is the line of conduct that leads to the desired end. For unques¬ tionably there must be in the nature of things some definite and fixed pre-requisites to success." He then proceeds to point out what these pre-requisites are, and explains the first of them thus:—" The sphere of activity of each individual being limited by the spheres of activity of other individuals, it follows that the men who are to realize this greatest sum of happiness, must be men of whom each can obtain complete happiness within his own sphere of activity, without diminishing the spheres of activity required for the acquisition of happiness by others. For, manifestly, if each or any of them cannot receive com¬ plete happiness without lessening the sphere of activity of one or more of the rest, he must either himself come short of complete happiness, or must make one or more do so ; and hence, under such circumstances, the sum total of happiness cannot be as great as is conceivable, or cannot be greatest happiness." To this first pre-requisite, the fulfilment of which we ex¬ press bv the word jwtice, three others arp annended; but a»</page><page sequence="71">"social statics." 60; " Social Statics" is confined solely to the development of the foregoing one, it is needless here to specify them. In the succeeding chapter, on the " Derivation of a First Principle," this proposition is reduced to a more concrete form, by carrying out a line of argument which is briefly summed up as follows: —" God wills man's happiness. Man's happiness can be produced only by the exercise of his faculties. Then God wills that he should exercise his faculties. But to exercise his faculties he must have liberty to do all that his faculties naturally impel him to do. Then God intends he should have that liberty. Therefore, he has a right to that liberty." " This, however, is not the right of one but of all. Wherefore, we arrive at the general proposition, that every man may claim the fullest liberty to exercise his faculties compatibly with the pos¬ session of like liberty by every other man." The objections that may be urged against this first principle are examined at some length, and reasons are given for concluding that, though there exist other limitations to the freedom thus enunciated, yet, " in drawing from it deductions respecting the equitable constitution of society, we may safely assert in full this liberty of each, limited alone by the like liberty of all—must so assert it." Under the head " Secondary Derivation of a First Princi¬ ple," Mr. Spencer goes on to show that " this first and all- essential law, declaratory of the liberty of each, limited only by the like liberty of all, is that fundamental truth of which the Moral Sense is to give an hituition, and which the in¬ tellect is to develope into a scientific morality." In evidence of this, he cites the fact that, " out of some source or other in men's minds, there keep continually coming utterances more or less completely expressive of this truth;" and he quotes from laws, charters, books, etc., the various forms in which it has been embodied. " So spontaneous," he says, " is this faith in the equality of human rights, that our very language embodies it. Equity and equal are from the same root; and equity literally means equalness." To these facts he adds sundry arguments, to prove that some such faculty as this supposed one is needful for the completion of the human constitution, and that its existence is implied by vari¬ ous phenomena in our conduct and thoughts. Devoting his following chapter to the " First Principle" itself, Mr. Spencer, after summing up the evidence, finally states it to be, that " Every man has freedom to do all that he loills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other</page><page sequence="72">66 MR. chapman's publications. man:" adding, that " though further qualifications of the li¬ berty of action, thus asserted, may be necessary, yet we have seen that, in the just regulation of a community, no further qualifications of it can be recognized. Such further qualifica¬ tions must ever remain for private and individual application." The rest of the work is a development of this first princi¬ ple into a series of propositions, bearing upon our social and political arrangements. It consists of chapters upon " The Rights of Life and Personal Liberty," " The Right to the Use of the Earth," " The Right of Property," " The Right of Property in Ideas," " The Right of Property in Charac¬ ter," " The Right of Exchange," " The Right of Free Speech," " The Rights of Women," " The Rights of Chil¬ dren," " Pohtical Rights," " The Right to Ignore the State," " The Constitution of the State," " The Duty of the State," " The Limit of State Duty," " The Regulation of Commerce," " Religious Establishments," " Poor Laws," " National Education," " Government Coloidzation," "Sani¬ tary Supervision," " Currency, Postal Arrangements, etc.," " General Considerations," " Summary," " Conclusion." In the foregoing analysis of " Social Statics," nothing but a bare outline of its abstract principles has been attempted. In the work itself these are enforced by numerous facts and illustrations ; and, as the titles of the chapters show, its latter half is practical in its applications. STALLO (J. B.)—GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE: With an OUTLINE OF SOME OF ITS RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AMONG THE GERMANS. By J. B. STALLO, A.M. Post 8vo, cloth, 6s. The great diversity of scientific pursuits in our day naturally prompts the mind to trace their several lines of direction to a point of concurrence, or at least to search for some general principle, under whose dominion the assemblage of so many individual figures may give rise to a significant picture. To this craving for mental unity the present work owes its existence. It is divided into two parts. The First has the character of a programme, and simply assigns the general points of view for a philosophical study of the natural</page><page sequence="73">"THE PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE." 67 sciences. The Second Part consists of an abstract of the leading German writers on the "Phdosophy of Nature" (Naturphdosophie), embracing principally the philosophical systems of Fichte, Schelling, Oken, and Hegel, preceded by an analysis of Kant's " Critique of Pure Reason." The work is the result of a long and serious study bestowed upon the original works of the writers referred to. Unfortunately, the materialistic utilitarian tendencies, wdiich at present per¬ vade every branch of science, under colour of a misconceived Baconianism, have interrupted the harmony between philo¬ sophical pursuits and the investigation of nature. Specula¬ tion is utterly disavowed, and the very worst passport which a naturalist could carry about him is that of a metaphysician. The assumption that the creative source of free thoughts, the mind, should be even distantly akin to the immutable forces wdiich actuate the movements of the universe, is held in abhorrence. The present work, however, is based on the principle, that the different manifestations of the vitality which bursts forth in nature's phenomena are comprehen¬ sively united, centered in the mind; that the implacable rigour of cosmic lawrs, which sways extensive matter, is iden¬ tical with the eternal freedom of mind in its infinite intensity. The author supports this view by contrasting it with the current opinions to the contrary, and showing the difficulties and contradictions the latter involve, when consistently car¬ ried out. These difficulties are exhibited in strong relief, in the exposition of Kant's phdosophy, the acme of the old dualism, where the contrast between the Material and Spi¬ ritual, the objective and subjective, is salient in the extreme. It is suggestive of the national characteristics of the Germans, and serves to discriminate between the spirit alive in them and that animating the French and English, that even in the philosophy anterior to Kant, the Germans, and among them Leibnitz and Wolf, always set out from themselves, from a few axiomatic notions relating to being, thought, ideas, the Deity, etc., and upon these synthetically constructed their system of science; whereas the English and French began with objective nature, analysed it, and then by generalizations sought to arrive at absolute conclu¬ sions. The Germans could not descend to the material world—hence they became Idealists : the English and French could not ascend to the summit of the Absolute—on that account they remained Materialists.</page><page sequence="74">68 MR.

In the Preface to the second edition of this work the author thus vindicates its character and intention:— " Whoever is familiar with Plato may remember the con¬ cluding portion of the second book of the ' Republic' He is speaking of the religious education of the Athenians, and he there rebukes the criminal folly of pre-occupying the minds of chddren, when they are too young to protect them¬ selves, with the traditions of the old mythologies. " Either," he says, " when they grow to be men, they whT become Atheists, not believing that those be gods of whom such things are told; or, if they continue to believe, it is because by these stories their minds will have become vitiated, and they will bow before beings whose service is even worse than Atheism. What Plato says of the mythology of the Greeks, I say of that of the Hebrews. I do not mean that the He¬ brew mythology is as insulting to the pure majesty of God, or as injurious in its direct effects to those who are brought to believe it. But I am sure that it contains things which are both insulting and injurious; and because, to ah thinking persons who conscientiously use the faculties which God has given them, large portions of it have become equally incredi¬ ble with the Greek, it may therefore, indirectly, be even more injurious, as permitting the mind to cling to it with an at¬ tachment which will render the straggle at parting, more violent and more convulsive. " It is this struggle which I have painted in the history of Markham Sutherland; a struggle which, as it seemed to me, his conscience forced upon him—which the tenderness of his nature made more painful than it would have been to a per¬ son with less in him of material of good—and out of which he only escaped with his moral insight distorted, and with his spiritual constitution too shattered to enable him to face successfully the trials of life. He is a person ill qualified for</page><page sequence="75">"tales of nurnberg." 69 such a struggle, as he shows himself in his first letter. It is not likely to prosper under the best circumstances, such kid- gloved daintiness and fingering with life. To a man in his case, employment, grasped strongly and vigorously, is the only resource. It is as idle for the mind to hope to specu¬ late, clear of doubt, in the closet, as for the body to be phy¬ sicked out of sickness kept lying on a sofa. Employment is for one wdiat exercise is for the other. He felt this himself in a way, but he chose the employment for wdiich he was least fit, and which his conscience ought to have forbidden to him. Naturally, therefore, failing, and by his failure having dis¬ qualified himself for trying anything else, what after befalls him is but what w^e should all of us be prepared to see follow in real life with such a person in such circumstances. " We cannot shut ourselves up and hve alone. Go where we will, we are forced out among our fellow men, among our duties and temptations. The order of the world cannot be set aside to suit our private necessities, and Sutherland is but placed in a position in which any one of ourselves might find nimself. He falls, as we feel he must fall, but as he would not and need not have fallen, if the seeds of religion, which had been sown in his chddhood, had been able to grow up freely, and had not been so mixed with fable and falsehood, so twisted and entangled into system, that his heart had bled to death in the effort of delivering himself."

MARIOTTI (L.)—ITALY: PAST AND PRESENT. Or, General Views of its History, Religion, Politics, Literature, and Art. By L. Mariotti. 2 vols. Post 8vo, cloth, 10s. 6^. Down in a southern clime, amidst the silent waves of a tideless sea, there lies a weary land, whose life is only in the past and the future. It is the purpose of this work to in¬ terrogate the monuments of her Past—to throw some light on the mystery of her Future. The history of nations is naturally divided into distinct epochs; and it is never so well studied as during those intervals of sdence and torpor, dur¬ ing which the exhausted nation supplies its empty veins with new blood, and developes strength for new action. The history of Italy, from the extinction of the Roman Empire to the fad of Napoleon, offers the advantage of a complete drama, which we are enabled to embrace at a single glance.</page><page sequence="78">72 MR. chapman's publications. The history and the literature of Italy, from the earliest re¬ vival of civilization in the Middle Ages down to the age of Leo X., may fairly be regarded as the history of the progress of the human mind in all the Christian wTorld. The seeds of civil and religious hberty were first developed on Italian sod; all branches of industry and commerce, of letters and arts, had reached their meridian splendour in that country two long centuries ere a faint twdight began to break through the darkness that reigned on the other side of the Alps. The present work, indeed, does not profess to be a history of Italy and her literature: its object is only to give con¬ tinuous essays on both subjects, as essentially connected to¬ gether; to study the sources of Italian greatness in the Middle and Modern Ages, and of its gradual downfall, en¬ deavouring to refer all that is said of the past as a lesson for the present and the future. The author divides the history and literature of Italy into five distinct eras. The first embraces the Middle Ages, and comprehends the history of the Italian nations from the time wdien they sprang vigorously forth from the mixture of the northern and eastern invaders with the remains of the Roman world: it goes back to the sources of modern institutions, manners, and feehngs, such as they arose from the contact of the rude but active temper of the conquerors with the corrupted but enlightened manners of the conquered: it examines the in¬ fluence exerted upon both by a new religion, which came to soothe, to level, to heal; and, sketching the course of events, it discloses how the new seeds of hberty and independence were gradually developed; it relates how the ancient seeds of Greek and Roman lore, buried under the barbaric allu¬ vions, began slowly to germinate in the theological and phi¬ losophical universities instituted by Charlemagne and his successors: it gives a short account of the semi-barbarous writings of the "Fathers" of the Church, of the monkish chronicles of the Middle Ages, and of the more active and living pursuits of the doctors of law in the universities of the newly-emancipated republics ; it traces the rise and pro¬ gress of the modern Italian language, and the influence ex¬ erted by the glowing poetry of the Arabians and Provencals, and the warlike songs of the Germans and Normans on the future start of Italian genius. From such a long course of events, and from so many heterogeneous elements, Nature proceeded to the formation of the age of Dante.</page><page sequence="79">"ITALY: PAST AND PRESENT." 73 The Second epoch in the age of liberty embraces the glo¬ ries of the Italian republics, from the first sanctioning of the independence of the Lombard cities down to the last agony of hberty in Florence under the repeated assaults of papal perfidy and imperial violence in 1530. From the sdence of the cloisters where it lay confined, the new literature started into life, wdd and fiery as the stormy age which it was called to enlighten; a blessed age, when the heart of the writer was glowing and the hand trembling with the agitation of public life,—when the scholar w_as at once a citizen, a warrior, a magistrate,—when genius moved uneonfined in its orbit, swayed by no power but the feeling of the importance and dignity of its mission. This was the literature of the age of Dante. It embraced the whole of the fourteenth century, but it descended also partially through the following epochs, wherever a faint breath of hberty was found to foster it. The Third age—the age of domestic tyranny—the age of the Este and the Medici, commenced at the court of the first Cosmo and his grandson Lorenzo de' Medici, and embraced those "golden ages" of Leo X., of the first and second Al- phonso of Ferrara, down to the last patronage granted to literature by the Dukes of Savoy, by the patrician aristo¬ cracy at Venice, and at Rome in the days of Queen Chris¬ tina of Sweden. Literature now abode in courts. The charms of poetry and eloquence learned to dress flattery in all the pomp of a courtly garb. It was an age of theatres and academies, of refinement and luxury, of ebriety and extravagance. Next comes the age of foreign dominion, or the age of de¬ cline, commencing with the first invasion of Charles VIII. of France, and ending with the epoch of the French Revolu¬ tion ; and from hence to the present time is the Fifth and last epoch—the age of re-action and recovery,—when, in the depths of her prostration under Austrian brutality, the name of Italy began to sound clear, glorious, and sacred, though undefined, vague, and new in the ears of her sons, and the desire and. will arose in their hearts, ardent, eternal, inex¬ tinguishable, of having an " Italy." This retrospect forms the material of the first volume. The author's views on all these periods he throws into the form of sketches of the greatest and most famous men of each age—including, in the first volume, Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Macchiavelli, Michael Angelo, Ariosto, Tasso, Vittoria Colonna, Galileo, Alfieri, and Napoleon.</page><page sequence="80">74 MR. chapman's publications. In the second volume (which relates to the Present of Italy) his plan is, in a similar way, to select some noted liv¬ ing Italian for the text of each chapter, and then to discourse on the whole department in which the selected person has distinguished himself. " Mazzini" heads a chapter on Young Italy—on the successive revolts which, in their failure, led to the formation of a Young Italy party. "Foscolo" gives occasion for observations on English treatment of foreigners, and on the English character generally. "Manzoni," " Grossi," "Pellico," " Giusti," are the titles of chapters on the recent literature of Italy—poetic, dramatic, fictitious; while " Litta," the author of 'Illustrious Families of Italy,' leads to some interesting notices of the old Itahan aristo¬ cracy. "Mayer" and Italian Education; "Anna Pepoli" and Italian women; " Gioberti" and Italian Catholicism; "D'Azeglio" and the modern practico-liberal Italian move¬ ment; "Pius IX." and the prospects of Itahan freedom, form the remaining topics of the wrork.

Jean Paul (as he styled himself in his writings) occupies the highest rank in the list of German litterateurs. Born in 1763 and dying in 1825, his career spread itself over the most interesting period of German literary history. In the num¬ ber and popularity of his philosophical novels, he was the Sir Walter Scott of Germany. Secured by his pension from want; happy in his domestic relations ; blessed with numerous friends, and an almost childlike amiableness, wdiich enjoyed to the last the pleasures of nature, as if they had been always new; having innumerable admirers ; unambitious of vain distinction or objects beyond his reach; with a heart suscep¬ tible of the noblest emotions ; believing in man's goodness, and in his immortality, he may bo said to have been one of the happiest men that ever trod this earth. Such is the cha¬ racter portrayed in this work, wdiich is presented to the reader as an authentic life, though not a translation of any one of the biographies of the great German poet-plhlosopher. It is well known that he was the most frank and unreserved of writers, and that he has interwoven in all his romances much of his personal experience. In addition, he left an autobiography, which constitutes Part I. of the present work. It is continued from ' Wahrheit aus Jean Paul's Leben,' (Truth from the Life of Jean Paul), Spazier's Bio¬ graphical Commentary, and Paul's Correspondence with his friends. Apart from the interest of the work as the life of Jean Paul, the reader learns something of German ltfe and German thought during the most interesting period of its history, and is introduced to Weimar during its most dlus- trious period,—when Goethe, Schiller, Herder, and Wieland were there, the monarchs of a literary court, which had attracted the attention and admiration of Europe. e2</page><page sequence="82">76 MR. chapman's publications. SCHEFER (L.)— THE ARTIST'S MARRIED LIFE; Being that of Albert Durer. Translated from the German of Leopold Schefer; by Mrs. J. R. Sto- dart. 1 vol. fcp. 8vo, ornamental binding, 6s. Three centuries and a half ago, in his native city of Nurn¬ berg, the great artist, Albert Durer, married a beautiful wife. The artist's soul, hungering and thirsting for beauty, must have that vitally present about his fireside and easel; there¬ fore Diirer's chosen Agnes wras the loveliest of Nurnberg's maidens. But she must also understand her husband, learn his nature and habits by heart, and, without the introduction of sharp angles, connect gracefully the sphere of his inward life with those of the actual world. But dowrn through the dim centuries comes floating the whispered scandal that Du¬ rer's Agnes could not do this; and out of the delicate and embarrassing materials of Diirer's matrimonial experience, the German novehst, Schefer, has constructed a tale, the ob¬ ject of wdiich is to show that even the trials of genius are part of its education—that its very wrounds are furrowrs for its harvest. SCHEFER (L.)—THE BISHOPS WIFE : A Tale of the Papacy. Translated from the German of Schefer, by Mrs. J. R. Stodart. Fcp. 8vo, cloth gilt, 4s. This is an Historical Tale of the times of Gregory VII., and is based upon the decree of that resolute potentate for en¬ forcing the celibacy of the clergy. This state, to wdiich the clergy of the Western Church were already bound by the decision of St. Gregory, had long ceased to be usual among that body. A tacit disregard of the custom had been so prevalent, especially among the German clergy, that its enforcement was as obnoxious as its introduction. The vio¬ lent ferment which this inflexible resolve of Gregory occa¬ sioned, the manner in which it was regarded as an outrage on the dearest rights of humanity, are here hTustrated in the story of the heroine Irmengard, the wife of a German bishop, who follows her husband to Rome, whither he goes</page><page sequence="83">"life of judge story." 77 to protest against the edict, and where he is imprisoned for disobeying it. The indignation of the sufferers at length grows into a conspiracy, in which Cenci, the powerful pre¬ fect of the city, is the principal, and which results in the violent abduction of the Pope to his castle, whde engaged in the celebration of Mass. Here the Pope, who at the time of the assault, pretends death, untd the Countess Matdda, the powerful and devoted adherent of the " Holy See," has sum¬ moned a strong party to besiege the tower and revenge his death. Just as the budding has been set on fire, the Pope appears at an open window, and, by assuring the spectators that he is stdl alive, is in time to prevent its destruction. The unhappy Irmengard, after an interview with the Pope, in which she beseeches him, in the most impassioned terms, to relent his cruel purpose, and restore her to the condition of a married woman, and gives vent to her outraged feelings in a storm of upbraidings and invective, flings herself and her boy from the top of the Torre de' Cenci. As a Supplement to the tale, and as a corrective of its historical transgressions, the translator has appended an historical sketch of the life and times of Hddebrand, w ho, from being the son of a humble joiner, pushed forward in the career of ambition, till he attained a power above kings and emperors.

It gives a fine insight into the internal history of the legal profession and the Federal Government, during their period of development and consolidation. Personally, he was a remarkable example of native force working its wTay through obstacles to a position of eminence and usefulness ; and to the student, therefore, his life is full of stimulus and guidance. THOM (J. H.)—THE LIFE OF THE REV. JOSEPH BLANCO WHITE. Written by Himself. With Portions of his Correspondence. Edited by John Hamilton Thom. 3 vols, post 8vo, cloth, 11. 4s. JosEPn Blanco White was by birth (1775) a Spaniard, and by profession a Catholic Priest. Being of good family, and possessed of superior talents and acquirements, he was ra¬ pidly rising to high preferment in the church, and high repu¬ tation in the country. At an early period, however, his thoughtful mind had become awakened to the evils and errors of the system which he was doomed to uphold; and subse¬ quently, through conversation with secret freethinkers among the higher clergy, and the perusal of the works with which they supplied him, he became an unbeliever in Christianity, which at that time he identified with Romanism. Seeing be¬ fore him the alternatives of death or life-long hypocrisy, he took advantage of the confusion occasioned by Bonaparte's invasion of Spain, and, under a political guise, which charit¬ ably concealed from his relatives his real motives, fled from the thraldom of superstition, under which he had long groaned, and, as a Spanish refugee, reached the free shores of England (1810) where he was hospitably received by Lord Holland and other English gentlemen, with whom his posi¬ tion and character had brought him into contact in his native</page><page sequence="85">"LIFE OF BLANCO WHITE." 79 land. For the first few years he found employment in edit¬ ing Spanish journals, both political and literary, which found their way from London to Spain and its colonies. Having become reconciled to Christianity in the more favourable aspects in which he saw it in England, he became a Pro¬ testant clergyman, and removed to Oriel College, Oxford, (1814,) then in its highest renown, for the purpose of study¬ ing English theology. Here he associated with Whately and Hampden, Senior and Hawkins, Baden Powell and John Henry Newman. On Whately's promotion to the see of Dublin, he accompanied him thither in the capacity of tutor to his son. He never accepted church preferment himself, lest he might give occasion for questioning the purity of his motives for having taken up his pen so vigorously against the Cathohcs. But though a Protestant and a Christian, he had never become a convert to " Orthodoxy," from which, indeed, he further and further receded, as he extended his acquaintance with the Scriptures and with the liberal theo- gians of England and Germany. His anti-trinitarian and anti-dogmatic convictions eventually became too strong to admit of further concealment or compromise; and again, in his old age, his integrity and love of truth compelled him to renew the sacrifices of former years, and to tear himself from the archbishop's fanuly, whose friendship, however, both in word and deed followed him to his grave. Avowing himself a Unitarian, he removed to Liverpool (1835), where he remained tdl his death (1841), and where, among new friends, he found an asylum in his declining years, and, in their religious sentiments and services, a faith and a worship congenial to his spirit and views. The work is an autobiography; or, rather, furnishes the materials of one. It is divided into three Parts. Part I. gives a connected narrative of his life from 1775-1826, in the form of a letter to Archbishop Whately, which, besides detading the outward circumstances of his early career, gives a lively insight into the social condition of Spain—the state of education at the universities—and especially into the operation of Catholicism upon youth and age, females and families. Part II. gives a sketch of his mind in England, from 1812-1824, showing the struggles of his reason against the common view of Christianity, and furnishing the free reflections of an original and meditative mind on the funda¬ mental doctrines and principles of religion and philosophy, which at that time were quietly exciting the attention of philosophical theologians. Part III. gives extracts from his</page><page sequence="86">80 MR. CHAPMAN'S PUBLICATIONS. Journals and Correspondence from 1824-1841, not only with his Oriel friends before referred to, but also with Southey, Coleridge, and Neander; Lord Holland, John Stuart Mill, and Mrs. Hemans ; and, latterly, with Channing and Norton, of America. " When I have thought of crossing the ocean," writes Dr. Channing, on hearing of his death, " the pleasure of in¬ tercourse with him has risen to my mind, among the chief I should find in England. Perhaps there was not a man in your country whom I wanted so much to see. I felt that no mind could open to me so interesting and instructive a history. I shall wait impatiently for his autobiography." THREE EXPERIMENTS OF LIVING: Within the Means. Up to the Means. Beyond the Means. Fcp. 8vo, ornamental cover and gilt edges, Is. The Three Experiments are exhibited in the history of Frank and Jane, a young married couple, who begin life in poor circumstances, but with hopefulness and prudence, deter¬ mined to incur no debts and to live within their means. Getting on in the world, and attaining the reputation of be¬ ing " respectable," they endeavour to keep up a correspond¬ ing appearance, and soon find themselves, not without anxiety, living up to their means, and, ere they are aware,—beyond. Frank speculates ; his affairs become perplexed; and ruin overtakes them. Reduced again to poverty, they re-com¬ mence life on their original principle, and learn by expe¬ rience that real happiness and independence consist in " Living within the Means." VERICOUR (DE.)—HISTORICAL ANALYSIS OF CHRISTIAN CIVILIZATION. By Professor De Vericour. Post 8vo, cloth, 10s. 6d. It is the design of this work to furnish a brief but conti¬ nuous and comprehensive outline of the history of Europe from the Christian era to the present time, and to place the</page><page sequence="87">" HISTORY OF ANCIENT ART." 81 science of history upon its lofty and real basis;—viz., the doctrine of Progress. Discerning, amid the tumult and dis¬ cord which appear on the theatre of life, that humanity in general, and nations in particular, are undergoing an organic development, which will ultimately exhibit, in perfect har¬ mony, the individuality of each and. the unity of all, it is the author's endeavour to trace this in his rapid sketches of the advancement and vicissitudes of civilization in Christendom; and so to deduce a philosophy of history, less exclusive, more comprehensive, more eclectic, and of a nobler moral bearing than that embodied in the generality of similar works. It is a history of " Christian Civilization," inasmuch as Christianity has sown the ideas, wdiich, during eighteen cen¬ turies, have been the moving power of European nations;— Liberty to the enthralled, and Equality to all; National Brotherhood, and Human Unity. The history is divided into five great periods, and presents the leading facts and features, opinions and discoveries of each; leaving more minute details to special histories (a co¬ pious classified list of which is given at the end of the wrork). Particular attention is paid to Chronology; the dates are con¬ tinuously marked, and chronological tables appended, recall- ing, m regard to each country, the succession of events, which is necessarily broken up in the body of the work. This ' Historical Analysis' wdl form a useful text-book in schools and famdies. In the present state of society, and especiaUy with the rising generation, such studies must prove both interesting and important. WINCKELMANN (JOHN.)—THE HISTORY OF ANCIENT ART AMONG THE GREEKS. By John Winckelmann. From the German, by G. H.Lodge. Beautifully illustrated. 8 vo, cloth, 12s. This volume is one of a series on the History of Ancient Art in general. It treats of Greek art alone, the monuments of which are far more numerous and interesting than those of any other nation. It presents a systematic exposition of the principles by which the author supposed the Greek artists to have been governed in the conception and execution of those e3</page><page sequence="88">82 MR. chapman's publications. works which still stand the noblest creations of artistic genius, and about which the students and the lovers of beauty, grace, and majesty, still gather with admiration and reverence. " I have endeavoured," says the translator, " to render this translation a worthy tribute to the memory of the illustrious author, whose innate feeling of the beautiful and elevated, and whose masterly apphcation of their principles to the formative arts, eminently qualified him for his task. His heart felt the beauty and grandeur of ancient art, and his understanding justified his emotions. Fearlessly he holds up to admiration the repose, the simplicity, the purity, and the truth to nature of the antique. He does not deal merely in the names and the dates of artists and their works; he is more than an antiquarian—he is the phdosophical historian of ancient art. He is not contented with presenting to view the most beautiful monuments of human genius, but he in¬ vestigates and exhibits the sources of their beauty, the cha¬ racteristics of their stylo, and the reasons why they stdl com¬ mand the admiration of the world, even as they did hi those distant ages wdien, Idee Minerva, they came into being, ra¬ diant with wisdom and beauty. Our own feelings tell us that he is right, when he refers us back to Nature as the sure guarantee of their undying fame. He expounds the causes and principles of the origin and cultivation of the arts; the circumstances, both external and internal, which pro¬ duced their flourishing state, and those wdiich brought about their decline and fall; and also the causes to which may rea¬ sonably be attributed the points of resemblance and difference observable in the arts of different nations. The soundness of his judgment, the acuteness and originality of his obser¬ vations, and the copiousness of his iUustrations, drawn from an intimate familiarity with every extant monument of ancient art, and with everything in ancient classic literature which could elucidate the subject to which he had devoted his hfe, render him the most trustworthy, instructive, and delightful of the writers on art. I cannot but think that a careful study of Winckelmann's History, and a thoughtful conside¬ ration of the great principles embodied in it, must necessa¬ rily tend to form a pure, correct, and elevated taste." 1</page><page sequence="89">83 MsoIIwtea. &amp; BEESTON (W.)—THE TEMPORALITIES OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH, as they are and as they might be; Collected from authentic Public Records.

CHAPMAN (J.)—THE COTTON AND COM¬ MERCE OF INDIA, CONSIDERED IN RELATION to the Interests of Great Britain; with Re¬ marks on Railway Communication in the Bombay Presidency. By John Chapman, Founder and late Manager of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway Company. 8vo, cloth, 12s. The cotton manufacture of England (which occupies capital to the amount of upwards of £30,000,000, wdiich affords em¬ ployment directly to probably half a million of persons, and indirectly to a great many more, and wdiich supplies two- fifths of our £53,000,000 of annual exports) has reached a magnitude far exceeding that of any other industrial enter¬ prise in ancient or modern times, and has a bearing, hi vari¬ ous ways, on the welfare of our own and other countries, acknowledged and felt by all. The activity and steadiness of this great system depend on a sufficient supply of the raw material, which at present practically depends on a single source, a fact wdiich, in itself, causes great and growing solicitude on the part of the manu¬ facturers ; whde the peculiar circumstances which affect that single source greatly aggravate the danger. (In fact, Lan¬ cashire may any year be laid prostrate by causes from whose action she has no escape, and over wdiich she has no control.) It is now very generally admitted that there is no chance of a large, effectual, and early relief from any of our colonies, nor from other quarters, whether under European or native government, nor indeed from any country beside India. But as doubts are entertained whether, as to quantity and quality, India itself can afford the needed relief, an inquiry is first made into the present state of the Supply of cotton from that country, so as to discover the causes wdiich have retarded its improved cultivation. Pud information is afforded in reference to the varieties of the plant itself—the peculia¬ rities of soil and climate—the implements and processes of agriculture—the state of the markets and mechanical arts— the efforts of the Government and private capitalists to effect improvements,—together with questions of a more general kind relating to the employment of European agency in the growth of the article, as wed as for buying it when grown,</page><page sequence="91">" THE COTTON AND COMMERCE OF INDIA." 85 and to the effect of the native local demand and to the influence of the land-tax. The general conclusion arrived at is, that In¬ dia can afford the supply which is required—that the cause of its shortcoming is to be found, not so much in the obstacles generally pointed to, and here examined, as in the want of adequate means of conveyance to the coast, without wdiich ah other remedial measures wdl prove, as they have hitherto done, comparatively ineffectual,—and that wdien, with this want supplied, our demand becomes steadier, and the natives have embarked their interests in making provision for us, we may reasonably expect the same improvement, which took place in America, from the same cause. (Ch. i.) From a detailed account of local investigations, extending to all the great cotton-fields of India, old and new (Bengal, Dacca, Bundelcund, Orissa, the Madras district, the Northern Circan, the Concan, Mysore, Guzerat, etc.), it is shown where a supply may be looked for (Berar alone being capable of producing three times as much as we could take) ; and from a comparison of the exports of the different districts, as well as of prices, it appears that even under the present disad¬ vantages of all kinds, the fact remains, as the actual result of the sum total of the circumstances which have existed, and do exist, that cotton acceptable in England, and obtaining, in our market, prices varying from So7, to 5d. per lb., can always be had in the large markets of the country between the Kistna and the Nerbudda for ±\d. or l%d. per lb. (Ch. ii.) The practical question now to be discussed is this—What has prevented the cotton of India from being sent to England under the operation of those prices And hi order to obtain a reply, inquiry is next made hito the causes of the increase of the exports up to a certain period, and of the cessation of increase after that period; and the facts adduced clearly prove that Carriage is the grand obstacle, and that with a radway, the indigenous cotton of Central Peninsular India, of its present quality, wrould have a safe and constant market at Liverpool, which it has not had, and could not have had, while employing the present means of conveyance. (Ch. hi.) To show that this measure is not only necessary as, regards England, hut highly desirable as regards India, attention is directed to the changes and improvements, immediate and ultimate, which would result from it, both of an agricultural, commercial, social, and moral nature. Questions are raised and information afforded about matters connected with the</page><page sequence="92">86 MR. CHAPMAN'S PUBLICATIONS. general welfare of the country, which are calculated to prove interesting to the philanthropist and general reader as well as the merchant. (Ch. iv.) A comparison of our general commerce with India with that of South America serves to show, to some extent, what force there is in the considerations of different kinds, and coming from different quarters, which have been adduced to account for the small amount of our general trade with our Eastern possessions: whde our Indian exports are equal, in absolute and gross amount, to our South American, they are not more than one-seventh per head wdien the relative popula¬ tion of the two countries is considered—a difference not to be accounted for by better government, lighter taxation, more liberal tariffs, etc., or by anything save a difference in the means of transit, or, at least, of accessibility. This result is stdl more clearly obtained by a comparison of the different states of South America with each other; our exports to Mexico, situated in the interior, and badly furnished with roads, amounting only to Is. 4i\d. per head, per annum, while to Hayti they amount to 5s. per head, being four times as much, in proportion to population, as to Mexico, and almost five times as much as to India; and to Cuba they amount to 10s. 11^. per head, while, with a taxation nine times per head greater than that of India, its own exports are £5. 5s. lid. per head, or forty-six times those of India. No aspect in which the question can be viewed seems to afford an escape from the conclusion that the same considerations, and no other, affect both cases; and that if it be want of facilities of exchange, which, notwithstanding similarity of race and habit, keeps Mexico and Central America below Venezuela and Peru, and stud further below Hayti and Cuba, the de¬ pression of India to the same point as Mexico may be safely attributed to the action of the like causes; and this argu¬ ment is strengthened by the fact, that within India itself, where differences of race, habit, or government cannot be alleged, the very same cause, viz. difference in the facilities of exchange, produces precisely the same effects as elsewhere in varying the amount of commerce. (Ch. v.) The latter portion of the work is confined to an exposition of matters connected with the Railway system of Western India, with which years of willing attention, and the fulfil¬ ment of responsible duties, have made the author familiar. The discussion is conducted in the form principally of an examination of Col. Grant's book in advocacy of the route</page><page sequence="93">"THE COTTON AND COMMERCE OF INDIA." 87 by the Bhore Ghaut to Poonah, stating the author's objec¬ tions to the character and direction of the line proposed by that gentleman and others, and his arguments in favour of the route by the Malsej Ghaut, proposed by himself, ap¬ proved by R. Stephenson, Esq., C.E., and adopted by the Great Indian Peninsular Radway Company. The writer advocates the subordination of radways in India, as in England, to commercial rather than to military convenience, as more likely in the end to serve the true interests of the Government, by serving the interests of the country; the safety and tranquillity of India peculiarly depending on the industrial and social improvement of its people, and on the maintenance, by practical means, of the opinion that they are better under British than under native rule. (Ch. vi.) The superiority of the route by the Malsej Ghaut is fur¬ ther showm by presenting the Engineering Features (ch. vii.), and Profits of the contrasted hnes, embodying careful esti¬ mates of the cost of construction and working, as well as the amount of traffic already created, which, if transferred to the railway, would, independent of passengers, give a profit available for dividend of 11 per cent, per annum; while the probability is, according to aU radway experience, that this would be very soon doubled. (Ch. viii.) "What then are the practical steps to be taken?"—a question which suggests another—"Why, with such flattering prospects, so wed certified, has no greater progress been made with this and other Indian radwTays and why is there so little apparent likelihood of greater rapidity of progress in future ?" The chief cause of delay has been the timidity of capitalists, arising from insufficient knowdedge of the facts of the case, and necessitating protracted negotiations for a government guarantee for a minimum dividend of 5 per cent. This measure is scrutinized on the grounds both of principle and policy; the respective characteristics of Government management and private enterprise are delineated, and the proper functions of each are discriminated; and, finally, the immediate practical steps to be taken are indicated, and the subject commended to the earnest attention of the capitalists, merchants, manufacturers, and Engineers of England—the natives and government of India—and philanthropists in general.</page><page sequence="94">MR.

A Complete Edition. Translated from the Second German Edition. By Catherine M. A. Couper, Author of ' Visits to Beechwood Farm/ f Lucy's Half-Crown/ etc. 2 vols., Post 8vo, cloth, 10s. 6c?. In 1788, William von Humboldt, then a Gottingen student, passed three days at the Spa of Pyrmont, and there became acquainted with Charlotte—a young lady, a passing guest hke himself, who had accompanied her father, a clergyman in easy circumstances, to that watering-place. " We lived," says the lady, hi her Preface to the Letters, " in the same house, sat next each other at the table d'hote, and, along with my father, spent three of the happy days of youth as inseparable companions in our walks among the charming avenues and adeys of Pyrmont. We had so much to say to each other—so many views and opinions to impart—so many ideas to interchange, we had never done." A few lines which the young student wrote in Charlotte's album on taking leave, and a profound impression wdiich his conver¬ sation and engaging manners had left in her heart, were all that remained of this short holiday. There had been no love made on either side: on Humboldt's none appears to have been felt. A quarter of a century had elapsed; the lady had been mar¬ ried, and was a chddless widow; her property had been lent to the government, and could not be recovered, which, with other losses, had reduced her to poverty. After vainly trying ah the means within her reach for obtaining her rights, she bethought her of applying to the great statesman, then (1814) seated among the representatives of Europe, whose steps she had been watching in secret for the six-and-twenty</page><page sequence="96">90 MR. chapman's publications. years since the parting at Pyrmont, with all the tenacious fondness with which woman will often chug to the recollec¬ tion of a first love when the rest of her life has been unhappy. To Humboldt she wrote, and received an immediate answer, responding in cordial language to her reminiscences, giving her all the help and counsel that was in his power. From this moment the correspondence began; and was continued without interruption untd Humboldt's death. The purpose is obvious throughout—to console, guide, and enliven, by advice and reflections at once elevating and serious. Its character is grave and whoUy intellectual. There is no gossip, hardly any personal notice of daily events, nothing sentimental or frivolous in the letters. The writer gives minute and careful details of the internal occupation of his mind upon many subjects; chosen, we may see, because of their application to the circumstances of his friend. The letters were preserved on both sides, equally by the wish of both parties, in unbroken privacy. " They contained nothing," says the survivor, "that in itself need to have been kept a secret; the whole world might have known their con¬ tents: but they were written to me; they were a sacred relic of my life, which I preserved in sdence, and hid from other eyes." Later, when the prospect of her own end be¬ came nearer, she felt that such letters ought not to be lost to the view of others, who reverenced the memory of her friend. A selection from them was copied out by her own hand, and left to be published after her death. MARTINEAU (J.)—HYMNS FOR THE CHRIS¬ TIAN CHURCH AND HOME. Collected and Edited by James Martineau.

The natural condition of worship has fostered, while the rationalistic has checked, sacred art. And as with art, so with poetry. Every simple utterance of a deep affection, not poured out with an aim, but merely overflowing, is poetry in its essence, whatever be its form: and on the other hand, no expression of thought or feeling, which has an ulterior purpose of instruction or persuasion, can have the spirit of poetry, though it may receive the usual diction and rhythm of verse. It is easy to perceive on what principle of selection a com¬ piler of hymns must proceed, who is impressed with this idea of the relation between poetry and worship. The hymns in the present volume are for the most part the productions of periods or of churches least affected by the intrusion of the rationalistic spirit into their devotion.

SMITH (J. T.)—LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT AND CENTRALIZATION : The Characteristics of each, and its Practical Tendencies as affecting Social, Moral, and Political Welfare and Progress: including comprehensive outlines of the English Constitution. By J. Toulmin Smith. Post 8vo, cloth, 8s. 6c?. If we take the constitution of the human body, with the relations and functions of its several members, as the true type of the constitution of the body politic, it will appear that right ideas neither of government, nor of freedom, are con¬ veyed by the common classification of governments as mo¬ narchical, aristocratical, democratical, or mixed. Such terms have no reality as illustrative of the inner and actual condi¬ tion of any nation wdiich, under any one of them, may be a nation of freemen, or, with the name unchanged, a nation of slaves. A more fundamental distinction is that indicated in the title of this work. The most natural, and therefore the most healthful condition of the community, as of the individual, is to be so constituted, and so circumstanced, as to have all its varied interests fairly attended to, and ad its varied powers fully and harmoniously developed; reaching its destined stature and symmetry, by freedom, growth, and</page><page sequence="99">"local self-government." 93 action everywdiere, without coercion, stagnation, or counter¬ action anywhere, securing, by the proper functional activity of ad the members, at once a stimulus to duty, and a cheek to usurpation; and attaining by the cementing power of mutuality and responsibdity, to the vital consciousness of national unity and aim, and to the energetic maintenance of national manhood and honour. The performance of any particular function by the appro¬ priate organ in the body politic is expressed by the term "Local Self-government;" wddle the performance of that function for the appropriate organ by any other usurping organ Avhatsoever is expressed by the term " Centraliza¬ tion." Every nation must have, as the consequence of its national existence, certain external and general relations, and must accordingly have institutions for their management; but these are subordinate in vital importance to those inner and particular relations, which enter into the dady transactions of affairs between man and man. And as each man is best acquainted with his own affairs, and best able to manage them, it must necessarily be the same, by an ascending step, as to every special district or associated group, were the right conceded, and the opportunity afforded, for gathering that experience which practice alone can furnish. Local institutions, sufficient in number and variety for all the ends of self-government, are therefore needed,—institu¬ tions not of a representative character, nor intended to supersede such, whether local or central, but true Parlia¬ ments of the people—convocations of the units of the nation —exercising legislative powers on all matters connected with their own local interests, and deliberating on ad matters connected with the nation of which they form a part; fur¬ nishing a complete machinery for the education and expres¬ sion of individual opinion, and for obtaining an accurate census of public opinion, and so rendering delegated legis- gation altogether unnecessary, and confining representative assemblies of every kind solely to administrative functions. Such is the idea of freedom and of government developed in this work. It is, moreover, not only maintained that such otight to be the character of a free government, but it is shown that such free institutions have actually existed iu England, and are still the birth-right and inheritance of every English freeman. By a copious induction of facts gathered from</page><page sequence="100">94 mr. chapman's publications. ancient national documents, legal commentaries, early histo¬ rical records, and other sources of information, the original Anglo-Saxon institutions are, historically at least, resusci¬ tated, and the true characteristics and practical realities of the English constitution delineated. A description is given of the "Folk-motes," or local convocations of shires, cities, boroughs, hundreds, wards, etc., with their functions and privileges. These institutions were maintained in vigorous activity in England for centuries, and their skeletons, capa¬ ble of full re-invigorated activity, still exist; and are, in spirit and principle, of as much importance and as applicable to our own day as to former times. The practical resusci¬ tation of similar institutions in Hungary was the work in which Kossuth was laboriously and peaceably engaged, before his country was involved in war and its misfortunes. Certain of the more general applications of these princi¬ ples are discussed and contrasted with the growth and re¬ sults of centralization, serving to individualize and bring directly home the importance of the whole inquiry. The Crown and Parliaments; Common Law and Statute Law; Right of Petition and Trial by Jury; Delegated Legislation and Commissions of Inquiry; Education, Protestantism, and Popery; Partnership and Communism; Public Health, Poor Law, and Police; Standing Armies and Militia; Taxation and Land Tenure, are severady considered in relation to the leading idea of the work. Reform Panaceas are likewise re¬ viewed, and the practical course of the true friends of free¬ dom and human progress pointed out. The work is designed to give a view of broad and lasting principles. It is not temporary either in its subject or object; though the principles developed, and many of the obsolete legal forms brought to light, will find immediate application to many questions of interest at the present time. It is, perhaps, proper also to remark, that the work is intended for the general reader, and divested accordingly of the obscurities and technicalities of expression to wdiich such discussions are liable. To those wdio know the value of national traditions as well as theoretic principles, and who, instead of merely basing their claims on abstract grounds, would aid in developing the nationahty of the future out of the historic soil of the past, or to those who require to see what English freemen have been, to assure them of what they might be, this book will be welcome.

But if there is one subject noAV less studied and less understood than another, it is this.

A QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY AND LITERATURE. Price 2s. Qd. The ' Prosnective Review' is devoted to a free theology, and the moral aspects of literature. Under the conviction that lingering influences from the doctrine of verbal inspiration are not only depriving the primitive records of the Gospel of their true interpretation, but even destroying faith in Chris¬ tianity itself, the work is conducted in the confidence that only a living mind and heart, not in bondage to any letter, can receive the living spirit of revelation; and in the fervent belief that for ah such there is a true Gospel of God, which no criti¬ cal or historical speculation can discredit or destroy. It aims to interpret and represent Spiritual Christianity in its cha¬ racter of the universal religion. Fully adopting the senti¬ ment of Coleridge, that " the exercise of the reasoning and reflective powers, increasing insight, and enlarging views, are requisite to keep alive the substantial faith of the heart," —with a grateful appreciation of the labours of faithful pre¬ decessors of ad churches,—it esteems it the part of a true reverence not to rest in their conclusions, but to think and hve in their spirit. By the name ' Prospective Review,' it is intended to lay no claim to discovery, but simply to ex¬ press the desire and the attitude of Progress; to suggest con¬ tinually the duty of using past and present as a trust for the future ; and openly to disown the idolatrous conservatism, of whatever sect, which makes Christianity but a lifeless formula. Twenty-seven Numbers have been published.</page><page sequence="102">96 MR. chapman's publications. il]c Westminster JjMieto. Published Quarterly. Price 6s. The Review is designed as an instrument for the develop¬ ment and guidance of earnest thought on Politics, Social Philosophy, Religion, and General Literature; and is the organ of the most able and independent minds of the clay. The fundamental principle of the work is the recognition of the Law of Progress. In conformity with this principle, and with the consequent conviction that attempts at reform —though modified by the experience of the past and the conditions of the present—should be directed and animated by an advancing ideal, the Editors seek to maintain a steady comparison of the actual with the possible, as the most pow¬ erful stimulus to improvement. Nevertheless, in the deli¬ berate advocacy of organic changes, it wdl not be forgotten, that the institutions of man, no less than the products of nature, are strong and durable in proportion as they are the results of a gradual development, and that the most salutary and permanent reforms are those, which, wdide embodying the wisdom of the time, yet sustain such a relation to the moral and intellectual condition of the people, as to ensure their support. In contradistinction to the practical infidelity and essen¬ tially destructive policy which would ignore the existence of wide-spread doubts in relation to established creeds and sys¬ tems, and would stifle all inquiry dangerous to prescriptive claims, the Review exhibits that untemporizing expression of opinion, and that fearlessness of investigation and criticism, which are the results of a consistent faith in the ultimate prevalence of truth. Aware that the same fundamental truths are apprehended under a variety of forms, and that, therefore, opposing sys¬ tems may in the end prove complements of each other, the Editors endeavour to institute such a radical and compre¬ hensive treatment of those controverted questions which are practically momentous, as may aid in the conciliation of di¬ vergent views. In furtherance of this object, a limited por¬ tion of the work, under the head of " Independent Contri¬ butions," is set apart for the reception of articles ably set¬ ting forth opinions which, though not discrepant with the general spirit of the Review, may be at variance with the</page><page sequence="103">" THE WESTMINSTER REVIEW." 97 particular ideas or measures it wid advocate. The primary objeet of this department is to facilitate the expression of opinion by men of high mental power and culture, who, while they are zealous friends of freedom and progress, yet differ widely on special points of great practical concern, both from the Editors and from each other. The Review gives especial attention to that wide range of topics which may be included under the term Social Philoso¬ phy. It endeavours to form a dispassionate estimate of the diverse theories on these subjects, to give a definite and in- teUigible form to the chaotic mass of thought now prevalent concerning them, and to ascertain both in what degree the popular efforts after a more perfect social state are counte¬ nanced by the teachings of politico-economical science, and how far they may be sustained and promoted by the actual character and culture of the people. In the department of Politics careful consideration is given to ad the most vital questions, without regard to the distinc¬ tions of party; the only standard of consistency to which the Editors adhere being the real, and not the accidental rela¬ tions of measures—their bearing, not on a ministry or a class, but on the public good. In the treatment of Religious Questions the Review unites a spirit of reverential sympathy for the cherished associations of pure and elevated minds with an uncompromising pursuit of truth. The elements of ecclesiastical authority and of dogma are fearlessly examined, and the results of the most advanced Bibhcal criticism are discussed without reservation, under the conviction that religion has its foundation in man's nature, and will only discard an old form to assume and vi¬ talize one more expressive of its essence. While, however, the Editors do not shrink from the expression of what they believe to be sound negative views, they equady bear in mind the pre-eminent importance of a constructive religious philo¬ sophy, as connected with the development and activity of the moral nature, and of those poetic and emotional elements, out of which proceed our noblest aspirations and the essen¬ tial beauty of life. In the department of General Literature the criticism is animated by the desire to elevate the standard of the public taste, in relation both to artistic perfection and moral purity; larger space is afforded for articles intrinsically valuable, by the omission of those minor and miscellaneous notices which are necessarily forestalled by newspapers and magazines, and F</page><page sequence="104">98 MR. chapman's publications. equivalent information is given in a single article showing the course of literary production during each preceding quar¬ ter.

I. SKETCHES OF EUROPEAN CAPITALS. By William Ware, Author of 'Zenobia, or Letters from Palmyra/ f Aurelian/ etc., Is. This work came into existence, like so many others uow-a- days, as a convenient way of disposing of matter previously used in the form of lectures. They are the sketches of a traveller, and aim to give the first rapid impressions of places visited during a year's absence from America. Delineations of Italian life and scenery occupy nearly the whole of the present volume. "Ancient Rome," "St. Peter's and the Vatican," "Florence," "Naples," "The Italians of Middle Italy," and " London," are successively touched off in a very picturesque and attractive style.</page><page sequence="105">LIBRARY FOR THE PEOPLE. II. LITERATURE AND LIFE. LECTURES by E. P. Whipple, Author of c Essays and Reviews/ Is. Mr. Whipple is the Macaulay of the ' North American Review,' having contributed to that Journal some of its most brdliant and elaborate essays. The Lectures in this volume were delivered before different literary societies in the United States, and are chiefly of an entertaining character. The subjects are as follows:—"Authors in their relations to Lde ;" "Novels and Novelists—Charles Dickens;" "Wit and Humour;" " The Ludicrous Side of Life;" "Genius;" " Intellectual Health and Disease." III. REPRESENTATIVE MEN. LECTURES, by R. W. Emerson. Is. 6d. The various phases of human thought and action find an incarnation in Men as well as in Institutions. Such men are Representative Men ; and as, in each class, one must necessarily be conspicuous among his fellowrs, he is the Re¬ presentative man of the class to wdiich he belongs. Thus Plato is discoursed of as the type of the Philosopher; Swe- denborg, as the type of the Mystic; Montaigne, of the Scep¬ tic ; Shakspeare, of the Poet; Napoleon, of the Man of the World ; and Goethe, of the Writer.
