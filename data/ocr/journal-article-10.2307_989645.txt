<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Matter of Metaphor: Literary Myths of Construction WILLIAM ALEXANDER McCLUNG Mississippi State University Since classical times, the dialectic of Art and Nature has found expression in architectural theories and practices that have claimed for the preeminent craft of Architecture the discovery of a system of correct design, construction, and ornament grounded in natural laws. The intellectual arguments that have made such systems plausible are rooted in assumptions about legitimacy in the choice and use of materials of construction, and assumptions about the right relationship of materials to structural function. Imaginative and ethical literature have most fully articulated these assumptions, although modernist architectural rhetoric sustains and renews them. In the Stoic eye, all craft is suspect as an illegitimate reordering of natural forms and natural processes; medieval esthetic systems may classify architecture as the bastard child of man and nature. The most effective and pervasive mech- anism by which architecture has circumvented such strictures is the functionalist formula that in essence requires identity of con- tent with form, of dweller with dwelling, of hollow with shell, as both a physical and a metaphysical unity. Such a metaphoric formula is realized fully only in imagina- tion, finding its fullest expression in English estate poetry of the i7th century. There, a complex set of literary devices permits the formulation of ideal structures in conformity with natural law, however defined, drawing on broad paradisal myths as well as narrower historical and architectural quarrels to establish a permanent dichotomy between the "natural," "functional" structure and its contrary. In the exaltation of form over content, and in the rehabilita- tion of luxury in construction, modern architectural theory and practice has radically modified the classical formula, while re- taining its essential terms. THE I 2.TH-CENTURY esthetician Hugh of St. Victor, having classified architecture as a subdivision of fortification, offers an entertaining etymology for the term "mechanic," which in his system is one of the four categories of philosophy and which embraces fortification and six other arts: Mechanica is so called from maechor-aris, that is adulteroraris, because, just as an adulterous woman is despised in comparison with a legitimate wife, so the mechanical arts are despised in respect to the liberal arts. I He was not alone in implying that architecture in some sense violated the natural order of things. In the same century Pierre le Chantre, who had joined his voice to St. Bernard's attacks on splendid buildings as denials of charity to the poor, added also that the impulse to build was a kind of disease (morbus aedifi- candi).2 In one instance architecture is unfavorably compared to a natural act legitimized and therefore fulfilled by law (marriage); in the other, the model is that of a healthy or diseased organism. In neither case does architecture qualify, either ideally or in prac- tice, as "healthy" or "natural." The English schoolman Alex- ander Neckham argued that because all things tend to seek the center of the earth, which is a sphere, therefore walls naturally should not be perpendicular to the ground, but built angling outward along the lines of force.3 His rehabilitative effort, how- ever grotesque, points up the difficulty of reconciling the act of construction with "nature," conceived of as a system of instruc- tions as well as of absolute relationships. "The history of human consciousness," Richard Gilman has recently written, "might be thought of, in part, as a struggle, through error, toward an equal- ity with nature, or at least what is posited as the 'natural' ";4 Neckham's quaint recommendation as well as his contempo- raries' arguments locate "the case against architecture" within a complex body of received ideas on the equivalence between acts of construction and nature, ranging from an antique moral an- tagonism to luxury to a modern redefinition of the concept of "nature" itself. At the center of the large body of works that either consign architecture to its proper ethical status or that make use of build- ings as literary subjects and symbols is the private house in its landscape, and a few texts bearing upon the English country i.

These texts, poems in praise and blame of country house life, continue and elaborate the arguments of classical moral essays that fix the normative conceptions of the relationship between nature and craft, and they epitomize the crafts in architecture. Several venerable tradi- tions in literature and the moral essay combine in these texts in unusual ways, joining to familiar arguments about charity and luxury a series of specific debates on current and past architec- tural practices. In drawing a distinction, both ethical and phe- nomenological, between "being" and "seeming," country-house poets join local quarrels about particular buildings and practices of construction to great moral touchstones of virtue and vice in human behavior. Their houses are persistently anthropomor- phized, and, whether good or evil in character, sustain Hugh of St. Victor's powerful but elusive condemnation of architecture as an illicit act, or illicit union. It is in the light of this censure that both "nature" and "craft" must be examined to discover what kind of building qualifies as legitimate. The Quarrel in the Background The idea of the English country house in poetry is a metaphor, a sustained figure of thought that holds up to practitioners and patrons of architecture a model half-grounded in actual struc- tures, half verbal or purely imaginary. In this figure are contained elements of an old intellectual debate, one that in its widest applicability puts one great definition of the ethical status of art (in its large sense of craft as well as "fine art," i.e., reXv- , ars) in conflict with another. One position has recently been well re- stated: ... first, that intellectual acts and products differed from works of chance by observing and embodying certain basic relations of fitness-of matter to form, means to ends, parts to wholes; and second, that the means to fitness could be specified as artistic principles or precepts.5 By this definition, art completes or fulfills nature, as Aristotle argues (Physics i99a16-17); his essential position is that virtue must be put into practice, and that arts either parallel nature in that they cause things to come into being in accordance with predetermined ends, or both parallel and supersede nature be- cause they carry the creative process beyond what nature can accomplish. Paul Valkry has given perhaps the most inclusive modern statement of "the case for architecture": If, then, the universe is the effect of some act; that act itself, the effect of a Being, and of a need, a thought, a knowledge, and a power which be- longs to that Being, it is then only by an act that you can rejoin the grand design, and undertake the imitation of that which has made all things. And that is to put oneself in the most natural way in the very place of the God. Now, of all acts the most complete is that of constructing.6 The antagonistic position, less systematically formulated, has been more widely diffused; in extreme form it is argued by Sen- eca in his 9oth Moral Epistle, a general assault on all the artisan crafts. Classical writers were fond of rationalistic reconstructions of the "first age" and of the origin of building: how "it must have been" and why man first built. Seneca is no exception; like Lu- cretius and Vitruvius before him he accounts for the first use of tools and the first shelters. But his purpose is to say not "how" but "why" building originated, and in so doing he translates a moralist's commonplace, applicable to all men at all times, into an historical event. Multa petentibus desunt multa, Horace had put it in the previous century: those seeking many things lack many things. Seneca transforms this state of mind into a crisis, located at the crucial moment in history when man, seeking to appropriate some part of the world to himself, in a stroke lost his mastery over nature. This is his version of "the fall," epitomized in the first impulse to seek artificial shelters against the elements, thus ending that "happy age, before the days of architects, before builders!" Such is the extreme position, disallowing all architecture, all acts of building, all crafts; the natural shelter of cave or tree that Seneca will tolerate is the limiting term in the series of primitive huts, rationalistic reconstructions of man's original habitat that are, in Joseph Rykwert's words, right because they are first.7 In all instances to the inside, so to speak, of the radical Senecan position, there must be compromise: nature is modified by craft to some degree, however faint or slight, and these versions of the "primitive hut" may serve as models to legitimize subsequent acts of building if both the forms (or processes) and the ends of architecture can be identified with or argued into a relationship with "nature." The definition of this acceptable synthesis of na- ture and craft has taken many forms, but before it is identified with any actual architecture or dogmas of building it should be recognized as a verbal, metaphorical construction, as a union of matter and idea in a moralized structure that depends for its legitimacy on a metaphysical "content," and on the faithful man- ifestation of that content in its form. The ideal house, or building of any sort, that perpetuates while claiming to override the primal divorce between man and nature, is an elusive synthesis of the concrete and the verbal, a metaphor for matter. The Modernist Model Modern architectural ideology has long depended on this model; it has served as an intellectual bridge between architects as unlike as Wright and Le Corbusier, in the light of assumptions that the new architecture 5.

That is, it was to be inevitable and predestined and in the nature of things. It was not to be one possibility among many, but the only possibility; and thus it was necessary that its determinants should seem to be outside the sphere of choice ... .8 Modernist rhetoric of the kind described here has been eschato- logical in that it has proposed or claimed to have discovered ultimate and universal forms (hence "inevitable" and "the only possibility") and ethical in that these forms have pretended to an identity with nature ("the nature of things") and thus are "right" or "legitimate" in some sense that is "outside the sphere of choice." The words rather than the buildings of Wright and Le Corbusier are documents in the debate, with its frequent redefi- nition of terms, over the proper relationship between nature and craft. Wright's The Natural House is suggestively titled; he argues that ... it is in the nature of any organic building to grow from its site, come out of the ground into the light-the ground itself held always as a component basic part of the building itself. And then we have primarily the new ideal of building as organic. A building dignified as a tree in the midst of nature.9 A single metaphor controls our mental picture of both the house and the tree, forcing an equation between them; both are figured as dynamic systems of outwardly evolving spaces (and thus asym- metrical). Such structures are natural ("organic") and therefore possessed of a moral character ("dignified"). That trees have no interior spaces to speak of, and that houses do not "grow" by means of cellular division from an original unit containing a sort of genetic programme, are obvious objections. But the metaphor is powerful because of the unspoken assumption that the house is a metaphysical unity, a "body," rather than a synthesis or agglomeration of distinguishable parts; hence the notoriously uncomfortable furniture of Wright's design, and the invective on ornament: Have no posts, no columns, no pilasters, cornices or moldings or orna- ment, no divisions of the sort nor allow any fixtures whatsoever to enter as something added to the structure. Any building should be complete, including all within itself. Instead of many things, one thing. o That "one thing" should have "structure-pattern made visibly articulate and seen in the building as it is seen articulate in the structure of trees or a lily of the fields." These words constitute an extreme statement of the theoretical identity or unity of forms and their functions: architecture, properly understood, is nature, and nature is implicitly "right" because it precedes all craft. Le Corbusier in the 1920s implicitly shared Wright's concep- tion of architecture as an organism or a body, in the sense of Horatio Greenough's division of the term "organic" into cate- gories of mechanical as well as of vital functioning entities.11 It is the engineer, he wrote in Vers une architecture, who puts man in accord with natural law; it is the beauties of geometry that are most "natural." The "nature of nature" lies in the consistency and unity of all phenomena, which are described by physical and mathematical laws and bodied forth in visible forms. Nature exists in essences rather than in particulars, in "pure forms in precise relationships... implacable... infallible."12 These forms constitute a natural language from which we deduce an architec- ture anterior to arbitrary "style." Like Wright's conception of the nature to which architecture is referred for validation, Le Corbusier's "nature" exists not primarily in particular and dis- crete manifestations but in systems of dynamic relationships; those relationships are metaphorically expressed as vital systems in Wright's case, as mechanical in Le Corbusier's, although the anthropomorphic model emerges fully in both architects' largest projects of the 193os, Broadacre City and the Ville Radieuse. The "radiant city's" four functions-living, working, circulat- ing, and recreating-are figured biologically (the commercial center is the head, factories and warehouse the stomach, and so on), while Wright describes the highways of Broadacre City as veins and arteries and the buildings as cellular tissue. 13 In each case, identification of the city with the natural model-here, the healthy human body-is made on the scale of the whole rather than of any member. The rhetorical parallels are both structural and ethical: structural in that each architect refers his system of building to a coherent metaphysical pattern inherent in and iden- tifiable with "nature," and ethical in that each sets such architec- ture in contrast with that which is "unnatural" and therefore in various senses wicked, unhealthy or dishonest. The implicit as- sumptions are complex: that "nature" exists, as a system of just, right, primary and good processes, and that architecture can and should imitate, or align itself with, these processes. The Pattern at the Center In English estate-poetry of the i7th century these assumptions are examined in the form of an argumentative dichotomy be- tween categories of houses variously judged as primary in time, virtuous and fructifying, or as novel, arbitrary, and dangerous. The most important are Ben Jonson's "To Penshurst" of about i6 i1 and Andrew Marvell's "Upon Appleton House" of about 1652, on the Kent and Yorkshire estates of those names; be- 8.

N., from Wrest," on the Wrest Park, Bedfordshire, of that time.14 The claims of some of these poems to be part of a formal genre of estate poetry may be challenged, just as other texts may petition for admission, for the boundaries of their subject matter as well as of their literary conventions are not rigid. But collectively these poems bring architecture and ideas about architecture together in the creation of structures that occupy a middle ground between matter and metaphor, and they help explain the rhetoric of modernist archi- tectural ideology. The opening lines of "To Penshurst" establish an ethical con- trast between two buildings, a difference immediately referable to materials of construction and architectural features both of Penshurst and of its unidentified foil: Thou art not, PENSHURST, built to envious show Of Touch, or Marble, nor canst boast a row Of polish'd pillars, or a Roofe of Gold: Thou hast no Lantherne, whereof tales are told, Or stayre, or court, but standst an ancient pile.... (11. 1-5) The rival house is conspicuously architectural, with elements (the lantern, the exterior staircase) that may more or less plau- sibly be linked with new or lavishly remodeled houses like Wol- laton Hall or Knole. These conspicuous features, rather than mere bulk (Penshurst itself is enormous) excite the sin of envy, and the greater sin of pride is subsequently assigned to them less for their size than for their assertiveness; they are "those proud, ambitious heaps" (1. i o i). A natural and therefore virtuous house by contrast specifically rejects architectural "statement." Carew's praise of Wrest is rep- resentative: ... pure and uncompounded beauties blesse This Mansion with an usefull comelinesse Devoide of Art, for here the Architect Did not with curious skill a Pile erect Of carved Marble, Touch, or Porpherie, But built a house for Hospitalitie. (11. 19-24) The implicit ethical metaphors are rich. Natural beauties are "uncompounded," not (as we might say) "synthetic"; art is op- posed to "use" (utility), which here as in other estate-poems is expressed in hospitality, the sustaining of a community of de- pendents and guests. Splendid materials are by their nature de- structive of "use" or (as we might say) "function." Carew forces the evaluation by a literary manoeuvre: No sumptuous Chimney-peece of shining stone Invites the strangers eye to gaze upon, And coldly entertaines his sight, but cleare And cheerefull flames, cherish and warm him here. (11. 25-z8) The antithesis is that of being to seeming, enforced by the judgment that an elaborate mantel actually precludes the warmth of a fire. There is no room for compromise; "art" actually is said to frustrate rather than parallel or fulfill the ends of nature, and architecture (here, by synecdoche, the chimneypiece) is figured as the opposite of "life" or "living," furnishing a cold image for the eye rather than fire to warm the flesh. What might be called the "exclusivity trope" is summed up in the closing lines (99-02oz) of "To Penshurst" as an antagonism of form to content, and of architecture to life: ... Penshurst, they that will proportion thee With other edifices, when they see Those proud, ambitious heaps, and nothing else, May say, their lords have built, but thy Lord dwells. It follows that the poets should denounce the "curious Skill" of the architect, the specifically conceptual faculty that trans- forms "building" into "architecture," or that subjects the pro- cess of building to an idea beyond the apparent and immediate requirements of "use." Thus at Wrest, "No Dorique, nor Corin- thian Pillars grace / With Imagery this structures naked face" (11. 29-30); what can be singled out as "architecture"-the orders -is merely cosmetic. Such architectural increment is both super- ficial and pernicious; in a representative passage Carew draws together the connected theses of contemporary architecture's destruction of function to serve appearances: Nor thinke, because our Piramids, and high Exalted Turrets threaten not the skie, That therefore Wrest of narrownesse complaines Or Streightned Walls, for she more numerous traines Of Noble guests daily receives, and those Can with farre more conveniencie dispose Than prouder Piles, where the vaine builder spent More cost in outward gay Embellishment Then reall use: which was the sole designe Of our contriver, who made things not fine, But fit for service. (11. 47-57) These distinctions and those of the other estate poets, which are similar, are superficially political and economic; the consis- tent literary position is that an antique system of largesse and charity has been eroded by the diversion of the wealth of estates into the glorification of their masters, and that in the simple sense 14.

It is this dimension of the poems' arguments that has engaged unsympathetic historians and critics like Ray- mond Williams, who in The Country and the City marshalls historical evidence and peels away layers of rhetorical distortions to argue that literature, particularly the Renaissance estate- poems, consistently forces an equation between antiquity, or "old time," and nature, or "timelessness." The intention, or at least the effect, is to devalue the contribution of serf or tenant to the estates' productivity, and by special pleading to locate in the rule and routine of the old manorial estates the maintenance of an ideally "natural" system of agricultural wealth and distribu- tion. Blame for such actual or supposed misfortunes as land enclosure or the decay of customary hospitality and charity at- taches, in literature, exclusively to the newcomers, the parvenus, the critique of whose architecture is one weapon employed to establish their "unnaturalness" or illegitimacy. Such is what we might call the "Tory theory of nature," draw- ing strength from the ambiguous status of the past as both irre- coverable and authoritative, or primary in the sense of the Latin priscus, which means both first and pure. Usually the application is to the life of the farm: Beatus ille qui procul negotiis / Ut prisca gens mortalium; Ben Jonson renders Horace's lines exactly as "Happy is he, that from all business clear / As the old race of mankind were. .. ." By a suave gradation upward from the cottage that timelessly recreates the mythical rural past to the great but ancient manor that perpetuates the historical rural past, the authorizing label priscus attaches to architecture of the old order. Yet this element in the poetic chain of reasoning lies well beneath the arguments on the surface. Renaissance poets have little taste for assigning praise and blame anywhere but to the characters of men and women who alone are responsible for the fruitfulness or barrenness of a society, and in directing their critiques against contemporary architecture Jonson and his suc- cessors refer us to the personal sin of Pride rather than to imper- sonal forces of class and economics. Insofar as their criticisms are of architecture, their houses are anthropomorphic, incorporating virtues and vices into their structures; as such these literary build- ings occupy a middle ground between descriptions of structures and figures of rhetoric. On the one hand, they refer us to specific or likely sources such as Penshurst or Wollaton Hall,'is encourag- ing us to examine the history of these estates and their architec- ture for a validation, or at least an understanding, of the literary positions taken. On the other hand, they make metaphysical claims for, or attacks upon, architecture by synthesizing actual or imagined but plausible structures with moral positions or arguments about the nature and meaning of construction. The kind of literary architecture that exemplifies both dimen- sions of poetic technique most simply and clearly is allegorical. About zo years before "To Penshurst," Spenser sketched such a model in the House of Pride: A stately Pallace built of squared bricke, Which cunningly was without morter laid, Whose wals were high, but nothing strong, nor thick, And golden foile all over them displaid, That purest skie with brightnesse they dismaid: High lifted up were many loftie towres, And goodly galleries far over laid, Full of fair windowes, and delightfull bowres; And on the top a Diall told the timely howres. (The Faerie Queene, I.iv.4) Architecture is under assault here at several levels. In the simplest sense, the house is both modish and luxurious, with its long galleries and abundant glass. The towers are suspect merely for their splendid display, but they, and the high walls, move us closer to a figurative rather than a literal structure by alluding to Babel. The impossible extravagance of gold layered all over the walls-echoed in the "Roofe of gold" of Penshurst's rival- takes us beyond Hampton Court as a possible architectural source to the Temple of Solomon (I Kings 6:zz), a building symbolic both of Israel's favored status with God and of her loss of that status, and thus charged with ambivalent historical and ethical meanings. The House of Pride lacks mortar, suffering not so much from an architectural as a spiritual deficiency; the cun- ning of its construction cannot ultimately compensate for its inner moral vacancies or perversions, or arrest its decay. The clock announces the subjection of the house to secular time. The House of Pride is literary architecture at its most exem- plary, synthesizing the material with the verbal or figurative in a portrait that associates splendor and fashion in architecture with both the Biblical history and the timeless psychology of the vice that is the structure's metaphysical content, its anima. Its com- plement in the Faerie Queene is the Castle of Temperance of Book II, whose medieval arrangement of apartments (hall with kitchens to one end and private quarters to the other) is imposed upon a point-by-point correspondence of the castle to the human body. In both instances architecture is evaluated as phenomenon and as idea: the contrasting forms of timeless castle and modern palace are intrinsically natural or perverse in their materials of construction and disposition of apartments, and each, in the heightened and explicit fashion of allegory, bodies forth the moral content of the life within, prideful or temperate. Their explicitness serves as a yardstick for all literary architecture, like that of the estate-poems, that less overtly synthesizes architec- tural phenomena with evaluations of the life lived within them, or in shorthand terms, "form" with "content." Literary architecture is, then, informed by much more than the 15. For example, I have argued that the "Lantherne whereof tales are told" of "To Penshurst" alludes to the lantern at Wollaton; see The Country House in English Renaissance Poetry, ch. 3.</page><page sequence="6">284 JSAH, XL:4, DECEMBER 1981 ';?? ;; t. ? ?? * r* ; a?it i? -, y?;? te? r i?t4T)"; ?~ \ ? a' O Q 1:t i 2. r Ba-r ".:r: a;,'i?? sr s4 ~???? u c? ?? , t ?,; J i. i e j ~?

Emblem 14 from Book IV of George Wither's Collection of Emblemes, Ancient and Moderne, London, 1635 (by permission of the Houghton Library, Harvard University). antique dialogue between luxury and frugality, and the apparent absurdity of praising vast estates like Penshurst at the expense of vast estates like Theobalds-the absurdity that has engaged Ray- mond Williams-will seem less so in the light of a fuller under- standing of the ethical core of the poetic formulas. The kinds of houses generally on the receiving end of Renaissance panegyric are for the most part medieval or early Tudor, at least at their cores, and generally share several characteristics that distinguish them from Elizabethan and Jacobean great houses: asymmetri- cal plans and elevations, lack of systematic organization of masses, and lack of a formal or systematic architectural vocabu- lary. Like their vainglorious antagonists, these "natural houses" are anthropomorphic, and the virtues of the master become the virtues of the house by incorporation into its structure. "Upon Appleton House," on Lord Fairfax's Yorkshire estate, although not medieval in fact, emerges as such a literary synthesis. Humility is its poetic mortar: "Humility alone designs / These short, but admirable lines .., where all things are composed / Like Nature .. ." The governing metaphor is the equivalence of man and house: The beasts are by their dens exprest, And birds contrive an equal nest; The low roof'd Tortoises do dwell In cases fit of Tortoise-shell: No creature loves an empty space; Their bodies measure out their place. ("Upon Appleton House," 11. 11 -16) The verses refer to George Wither's popular emblem of 163 5 of a tortoise before a rural cottage, both types of proper accommoda- tion (Fig. i). In the contrary sort of structure, the continuity between inside and outside, dweller and dwelling, content and form is sacrificed to an idea more intellectual than merely gross; the rival house is "a hollow Pallace," "a marble crust," the work of an architect Who of his great design in pain Did for a model vault his brain, Whose Columnes should so high be raised To arch the brows that on them gaz'd. ("Upon Appleton House," 11. 5-8) The brain rather than the body has determined the dimensions of a jeu d'esprit at once dangerous in its violation of nature (quar-</page><page sequence="7">McCLUNG: LITERARY MYTHS OF CONSTRUCTION 285 ries have been exhausted, Marvell says, and forests levelled to build it) and blasphemous in its likeness to Babel (the architect thought "by Breadth the World t'unite / Though the first Build- ers fail'd in Height"). It is both easy and reasonable to discount literary positions like this, especially if one finds English Renaissance architecture distinguished by vigor and originality; but to so discount is to argue from a different set of assumptions about what the act of construction means. In the poets' consistent hostility to the "prodigy houses" (as the great English country homes of the period are often called) we can see something like the reflection of that architecture's self-referring and idiosyncratic rhetoric, and locate the literary antagonism to architecture specifically in those qualities of the houses that appear to work against "na- ture." Longleat in Wiltshire, or Wollaton and the other Smyth- son houses, can hardly, whatever their virtues, sustain the bio- logical metaphor that with some justice is often applied to me- dieval manors like Penshurst or Haddon Hall (Derbyshire). If the older houses "grew," putting out segments (wings, ultimately courtyards) in response to "internal pressures" or necessities of function, then by contrast the new houses, with their symmetri- cal massing and frequently centralized plans, invite admiration as shaped things whose exterior surfaces have highest priority. Most estate-poems pay tribute to ancient manorial hospitality, several offering elaborate set pieces of communal dining in the great Hall, the reduction in importance of which is striking in the plans of prodigy houses. Because the estate-poets join praise and blame of structures to praise and blame of conduct, the architectural changes that ap- peared to be replacing the "functional" hall by the "frivolous" parlor tended to be understood as moral changes, and moral issues. One need not-in fact, should not-accept these com- plaints as accurate social analysis; they are too similar in sub- stance and tone from the i4th through the 18th centuries. Nor is there any reason to suppose that specifically medieval (or Eng- lish) systems of construction and design alone qualify as "natu- ral"; no onus attaches to a modern house if it is free of the characteristics of a "house of pride." In fact the consistently negative formulas of praise, and the persistent polarity of good house and bad house, ensure that a proportionate relationship is maintained. The key terms of the "contract with nature" are relative absence of ornament, unprepossessing architectural lan- guage, modest use of natural resources, and maintenance of a proper system of human relationships. In possession of these largely negative graces, the virtuous house remains a constant algebraic quantity, an x whose value depends upon the specific equation within which it appears. A century after Jonson's time, Alexander Pope in the Epistle to Burlington, on the occasion of the publication of Palladio's designs, draws Jonsonian conclu- sions from the juxtaposition of a Palladian to an English Baroque country estate, in verse that calls up the Horatian ideal of the self-sufficient farmer as a reproof to a profligate grandee. As natural and virtuous structures, Penshurst and (for example) Burlington's villa at Chiswick are equivalent. Each conforms to timeless, "natural" architectural laws, and each is contrasted with a structure supposedly arbitrary in design and indefensibly extravagant, whether a Jacobean country house or something on the order of Blenheim Palace. Natural Artifacts In juxtaposing a tortoise to a cottage as functional equivalents, the emblematist Wither effectively extended the definition of nature to an artifact, insofar as that artifact (the cottage) quali- fied as wholly or essentially "natural" by virtue of perceived submission to natural laws (like the shell, it is a perfect fit), or by virtue of the unaltered nature of its materials (which refer us without distortion to their source in nature), or insofar as it could be understood as the equivalent or complement of the "content," or virtuous life led within. These are the formulas by which architecture overcomes or circumvents the classical moral strictures against craft, for these are the terms on which architec- ture is ethically permissible. The routes of translation from the literary assumptions of Jonson, Marvell, or Pope to the rhetoric of Wright or Le Corbusier are various and elaborate, but two instances may serve to demonstrate the process of modification and adaptation that has kept the tortoise and the cottage useful as metaphors of functionalist theory. Literary tradition in the English Renaissance remained faithful to its Latin models in deducing relatively primitive architectural forms from a given basis of moral content; whatever the actual sophistication of a virtuous (or at least acceptable) building, it had to meet criteria of identity with "nature," understood as essential and the equivalent of the building's content, just as "art" was the equivalent of its form. But to discover an essential "moral," "right," or "natural" form antecedent to content would turn the situation on its head: desirable content, rather than determining form, would flow from it. That form emerges in the late I7th and I8th centuries in consequence of French rationalistic inquiry into the nature of the orders, a phenomenon well documented in architectural studies but relatively unfamiliar in literary and general intellectual history. Without attempting to do justice to Perrault, Cordemoy, Lodoli, or Milizia I should point immediately to the abb_ Laugier's Essai sur l'architecture of I753. Eager to legitimize neo-classicism as the only proper style, Laugier derived from his own rationalistic account of the construction of the first, "primitive" wooden hut the language of column, entablature, and pediment. The hut has not, in the fron- tispiece to the 1755 edition, even ceased to be "nature," inas- much as the upright members are still rooted in the earth. From this prototype derive toutes les magnificences de l'architecture, not in the conventional evolutionary sense set forth by Vitruvius (II, i) and accepted in Laugier's time, that the first construction</page><page sequence="8">z86 JSAH, XL:4, DECEMBER 1981 was the germ of all future building, but in the radical sense that the first construction, as a necessary and natural and inevitable act, held formal authority as a model for all subsequent acts of building. The Senecan question-Should it have been built?-is sub- merged in the analysis of how it must have been built, and by referring unfailingly to it the modern architect, regardless of the materials he uses, avoids error and conforms to nature's laws. What is not implied by the three structural elements, such as a wall, is tolerated if it fulfills minimally necessary functions, and without flourish. What is neither implicit in column, entablature, or pediment nor necessary to the purposes of the building-pil- asters, for example-is forbidden. Laugier's ideal building is the Maison Carree at Nimes; here the language of the Corinthian order is not expressive of a solidity in the building it decorates, but in fact constitutes that solidity. The order is the building. Structures of this kind are identifiable with nature because they repeat a primal act, and because they allow no disjunction between form and content, or hollow and shell. They cannot be neutralized in the conventional literary manner. The negative formulas of poetry permitted architecture to assimilate itself to nature through identity of materials and through echoes of natu- ral forms. What Laugier authorizes is the reverse: to assimilate nature to architecture by locating the quintessentially natural act of construction within a vocabulary of specific structural rela- tionships. The ethical validation for architecture remains the same-that architecture conforms to "nature"-but the restric- tion to prosaic materials or to materials disposed in imitation of natural forms (like the snug cottage that mimics the turtle's shell) dissolves into the liberating form of an architectural language that is an abstraction, not identifiable with wood or stone alone, and which imitates a primal act that is conceptual and willed rather than instinctual and reflexive. The Rehabilitation of Luxury The effect of Laugier's reformulation of the structure of archi- tecture's relationship to nature is that the problem of luxury is redefined as the problem of function. Classical hostility to ar- chitecture normally took the form of general antagonism to lux- ury in its widest sense: "anything unneeded."'6 But the redefini- tion of luxury not as mere superfluity but as a violation of the essential nature of a being or thing was implicit in classical mor- alizing. Plutarch records in his life of the Spartan Lycurgus (a Stoic prototype) that It was because he was used to... simplicity that Leotychides the Elder, as we are told, when he was dining in Corinth, and saw the roof of the house adorned with costly panelings, asked his host if trees grew square in that country. 17 Although the wit is provincial, the point is that "luxury" is a question not of waste but of the order or fitness of things. Leo- tychides implies that a properly paneled ceiling would preserve or restate the natural forms of the trees, or that the coffers would be acceptable were trees actually square. The objection is not to panels as such-an apparent "luxury"1s--but to their form. Luxury as a formal vice in a building lies at the heart of the rhetoric of modernist ideology, of what has been called by Sig- fried Giedion "the demand for morality in architecture."19 In the American context that gave birth to Louis Sullivan and Wright, that "demand" will make most sense in the wider picture of 19th-century calls for purification in private morals and public institutions. In architecture Horatio Greenough had presciently called for a reformation of architectural ornament, "to arrest the tide of sensuous and arbitrary embellishment," while giving shape to the idea that would emerge as the cliche of modernism: Instead of forcing the function of every sort of building into one general form, adopting an outward shape for the sake of the eye of association, without reference to the inner distribution, let us begin from the heart as a nucleus, and work outward.20 Greenough's words are noted and extended in Walden, of which Thoreau devotes a substantial part of the first chapter, "Economy," to the subject of architecture. But it is the unique status of Walden in American letters as a manifesto of liberation at once hedonistic and severely puritanical that gives his archi- tectural observations so much force. Thoreau agreed with Gree- nough that contemporary architecture failed to unite form to content, or appearances to functions, but he dismissed Gree- nough's concentration on propriety of style, placing his empha- sis rather on the moral character that must precede and deter- mine any style: What of architectural beauty I now see, I know has gradually grown from within outward, out of the necessities and character of the in- dweller, who is the only builder-out of some unconscious truthfulness, and nobleness, without ever a thought for appearance; and whatever additional beauty of this kind is destined to be produced will be preceded by a like unconscious beauty of life.21 Thoreau had his own "country house," the famous hut at Walden Pond, and in his writings he describes several other struc- tures. The architecture in each case is moralized and anthro- pomorphic; the famous and fussy itemizations of the materials and costs of construction for the Walden hermitage are more than the "economies" celebrated throughout the chapter, and 16.

They are intimacies, identifications of his body and its needs with the protective shell of the house, "this frame, so lightly clad, a sort of crystallization around me." In expanding on Greenough's arguments he calls for a house "whose inside is as open and manifest as a bird's nest," and elsewhere describes the structure of a lodge in Maine, whose logs were held one upon another by very large pins, driven in diagonally on each side, where branches might have been and then cut off so close up and down as not to project beyond the bulge of the log, as if the logs clasped each other in their arms.22 The house is both a tree and a loving couple; details of con- struction are approved to the extent that they correspond to the original structure of the materials (e.g., logs mimic the position of branches); and the building is merely an extension of nature, "so primitive that you could at once refer it to its source ... but a slight departure from the hollow tree, which the bear still inhab- its, being a hollow made up with trees piled up, with a coating of bark, like its original." Elsewhere he celebrates a larger and more populous house, standing in a golden age, of enduring materials, and without gingerbread work, which shall consist of only one room, a vast, rude, substantial primitive hall, without ceiling or plastering, with bare rafters and purlins supporting a sort of lower heaven over one's head. With its single room, "enduring materials," and continuity be- tween inner and outer surfaces of the shell (in the prohibition of a ceiling or of plaster), this imagined structure is a material meta- phor for unity and the transcendence of time. The Senecan argument against all craft has seemed disturbing in the light of the more accepted Stoical appreciation of the dignity of labor. Although united in their antagonism to luxury, the pastoral or savage moralist who imagines a life free of both work and desire, and the georgic poet or memorialist of country life, are natural antagonists. It is here that Thoreau's linkage of architecture to personal character departs from the antique and accepted mode of opposition to luxury, for in his refusal to play the Horatian husbandman as much as in his rejection of mercan- tile and professional activities, Thoreau begs the question of "content" or "function" in his own life. It is as functionless as the Senecan unfallen man's, and as free. The key to the perennial popularity of Walden among American youth, and indeed to its status as perhaps the greatest national meditation, lies in its Senecan synthesis'of restraint and release, of self-denial and ab- solute freedom of choice. The model to be imitated-Thoreau's own life-is a structural prototype, a parable or fable, and not a specific pattern of behavior or set of actions to be duplicated. The same is true of his architecture, whose radical primitivism is carefully associated with his own choices in life, and which he will allow to be supplanted by "architecture" in its more formal sense should the ordinary citizen ever achieve a life "simple and agreeable to the imagination." The question of specifically pro- per "content"-of the life, for example, of the Horatian farmer -is irrelevant; only the knowledge of the self and of the uni- verse, Seneca's prescriptions for the philosophic life in the 9oth Moral Epistle, constitute "content" or "function" in experience. As no man's life can be prescribed, so no architectural forms can be predetermined; the limitation placed on the form of a struc- ture is implicitly only the restriction to proper expression of its indweller's "beautiful living." Doubtless for Thoreau the beauty of life that alone would bring about beautiful architecture would never have extended far beyond a life of material simplicity and restraint; but he left the door open for anyone to define the matter for himself. In implying that the form of a structure is legitimized by its conformity to beautiful living within, and in refraining from prescribing that living, Thoreau sets no limits for the architect. Like Laugier, he locates architecture's conformity to nature in its faithful expression of function, and unlike him he infuses the concept of function with powerful and ambiguous moralizing on the integrity of the self and the irreplaceable and unique character of individual experience. The two constitute an index to the moral authority to which modern architecture has pretended: the authority of internal structural relationships over external demands of function, and the authority of the unique and ever-new solution to every architectural problem, the unique and ever-new expressive form for every individual function. Both Laugier's hut and Thoreau's are codes capable of infinite expansion; their descendants in modern architecture need claim only to have followed nature by expressing function through form to appropriate their legitimate status. Modern architecture owes much to Laugier's reversal of the primary status of "content," but it has flourished with the neu- tralizations of the classical injunctions against luxury in its sense of superfluity. As a violation of the building's true nature rather than as a characteristic of the life of the inhabitant-that is, as a question of purely architectural morality--luxury, or excess, or even its equivalent modernist term "falsehood," is no threat to the architect, who is held to no particular model of virtuous living or function in the determination of proper form, but only to the logic of the form itself. The power of the functionalist formula, that identifies both "nature" and "virtue" in architec- ture as the equivalence of a structure with its contents, lies in its adaptability to shifting definitions of "nature." What the rhe- torical, metaphorical tradition insists upon is continuity-be- tween interior and exterior, being and seeming, content and form, life and architecture. What is actually approved varies from the hollow of a tree to a lodge, a farm, an ancient manor, a spruce Palladian villa, a prairie house, or a glass tower. It is no news that the shorthand ethics of "form following zz. Cited in The Literature of Architecture: The Evolution of Archi- tectural Theory and Practice in Nineteenth-Century America, ed. D.

But they remind us that ancient ethical strictures on sophisticated architecture have never vanished; they have consistently been absorbed into the defensive but use- ful formulas that define a certain kind of architecture as exempt from the condemnations, and as parallel to and in extension of nature itself. Pope's lines to Lord Burlington would serve even today as an inscription for an academy of architecture; their fluid imperative never goes out of date: To build, to plant, whatever you intend, To rear the Column, or the Arch to bend, To swell the Terras, or to sink the Grot; In all, let Nature never be forgot.</page></plain_text>
