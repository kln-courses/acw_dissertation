<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> CHAPTER FIVE CAPILLARY ROUTES OF THE UPPER INDUS While the Old Road across the Hindu Kush in Afghanistan connected  Taxila to Bactria and western Central Asia, an alternative network of  intertwined passageways through deep river valleys and high moun- tain passes in the upper Indus region of northern Pakistan directly  linked major arteries of the Northern Route of the Indian subconti- nent with branches of the silk routes in the Tarim Basin of eastern  Central Asia. Capillary routes following the Indus, Gilgit, and Hunza  rivers and side valleys across passes through the western Himalaya,  Karakorum, and Pamir provided paths for long-distance trade and  cross-cultural transmission between transregional overland arteries  at a “Crossroads of Asia.”1 Before the construction of airports, jeep  roads and the Karakorum Highway (KKH) between Pakistan and  China, capillary networks gave ancient travelers many choices of  north-south and east-west itineraries. Modern routes followed by the  KKH through northern Pakistan and the Salang tunnel north of Kabul  across the Hindu Kush in Afghanistan have eclipsed the ancient path- ways through mountain valleys and passes, but travelers who wrote  their names in graffiti inscriptions and drew images on rocks at river  crossings and wayside shrines were not restricted to staying on major  highways.2 As Marc Bloch remarked in regard to medieval Europe:  “Traffic, in short, was not canalized in a few great arteries; it spread  1 “Crossroads of Asia” broadly encompasses the modern Northern Areas of Paki- stan, although the phrase also applies to the Tarim Basin of Xinjiang in western China,  borderland areas of northern Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan, and western  Central Asian republics of Kirghizstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Errington and  Cribb extend the concept of “Crossroads of Asia” to parts of India and Iran: “For  us the Crossroads of Asia is a broad concept, centrally focused on Afghanistan, but  also including the southern Central Asian republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and  Tadzhikistan, to the north; eastern Iran, or Khorasan to the west, and the north- western parts of Pakistan and India to the east and south” (1992: 1). Owen Lattimore  includes Mongolia, Xinjiang, and other areas of eastern Central Asia in the “Inland  Crossroads of Asia” (Lattimore, Owen. 1962. Studies in Frontier History: Collected  Papers, 1928–1958. London: Oxford University Press, 119–133).  2 Foucher 1942: 1.22–24.

Bloch’s comments on medieval European roads are relevant to  trans-Asian routes: It is in the nature of good roads to create a vacuum around them—to  their own profit. In the feudal age, when all roads were bad, scarcely  any of them was capable of monopolizing the traffic in this way. (Bloch  1961 [1949]: 1. 63) Instead of following a single main route, “. . . the traveler had almost  always the choice of several itineraries, of which none was absolutely  obligatory” (Bloch 1961 [1949]: 1.64). Rather than functioning like  interstate highways in the United States or the Autobahn in Germany,  which create vacuums by monopolizing traffic, multiple itineraries  allowed merchants, monks, pilgrims, and other ancient travelers to  choose from interconnected passageways. Their decisions depended  on many factors, including the seasonal condition of mountain passes  and river fords, the availability of provisions, animals, and porters,  as well as political stability, security, and sometimes the location of  religious shrines along the way.3 Topographical imperatives were often  decisive in choosing routes through the high mountain desert environ- ment, where travel from one point to another in a straight line was  not possible. Since crossing the high mountains was difficult for large  groups of traders in caravans, capillary networks were probably used  for a smaller scale of trade than the bulk trade of the main arteries. Indian, Iranian, Chinese, and Tibetan inscriptions and petroglyphs  lining the interconnected pathways belong to travelers and residents  from a wide range of cultural and linguistic backgrounds and show  that this region was definitely not a “cul de sac” (Fussman 1986c:  56–58; 1993b: 1).4 The written and visual records, as well as stray  archaeological finds, the testimony of Chinese pilgrims and other lit- erary references, and evidence of Buddhist manuscripts and sculptures  found near Gilgit demonstrate significant patterns of cross-cultural  movement. Capillary routes through this high-altitude transit zone  between South and Central Asia were used for migrations across the  mountains, long-distance trade in valued commodities and cultural  expansion.

Capillary networks in northern Pakistan (Map 5.1) belonged to  larger networks of trans-Asian trade routes, and played a crucial role  in linking the major overland arteries of South Asia with the silk  routes of Central Asia and China. While earlier chapters gave broad  overviews of South Asian networks, this chapter focuses on the role of  a particular transit zone in Buddhist transmission beyond the Indian  subcontinent. In the first part of the chapter (Geography, Economy,  and Capillary Routes in a High-Altitude Environment), geographi- cal and economic features are given a detailed treatment in order to  explain links between transregional and intraregional networks. The  second part of the chapter (Graffiti, Petroglyphs, and Pilgrims) exam- ines epigraphic records and visual markers in correlation with literary  accounts of Chinese pilgrims, Arabic and Persian sources, and a Kho- tanese Śaka itinerary. These combined sources illustrate Manifestations  of Buddhist Presence at individual nodes in the upper Indus, Gilgit  and Hunza valleys. The implications of this evidence for understand- ing patterns of long-distance Buddhist transmission at élite and sub- élite levels are discussed in the chapter conclusions. Geography, Economy, and Capillary Routes in a  High-Altitude Environment Deep river valleys and high passes in the mountain desert environ- ment played determining roles in the formation of capillary networks  that linked this border region to ancient Gandhāra, Swat, Kashmir,  and the Tarim Basin. The Karakorum, Hindu Kush, and western  Himalayan mountain ranges converge in this area, where many of the  world’s tallest mountains are concentrated, including K2 (8611 m),  Nanga Parbat (8126 m), Rakaposhi (7788 m), and Batura (7785 m).  The stark difference in altitude between the summit of Nanga Parbat  (8126 m) and the bottom of the Indus gorge (ca. 1300 m) indicates “a  very young uplift” (Gansser 1964: 66) in terms of geological time.5 Gla- ciers cover over a quarter of the Karakorum mountain range, which is  5 Gansser, Augusto. 1964.

While the gradual advance of gla- ciers down the slopes of the mountains often block roads, retreating  glaciers can open new routes. The geological dynamism and vertical land- scape presented special challenges for habitation and long-distance trade  and travel, but the geographical barriers were not insurmountable. Many valuable commodities, especially precious stones and met- als, either originated in or were transported through the mountains of  northern Pakistan.7 Several gemstones incorporated into the saptaratna  classification are found in the upper Indus region and adjacent areas  of Chitral, Swat and Kohistan. Emeralds, yellow-green epidote, green  actinolite (which includes the jade mineral nephrite), green serpen- tinite, pink to fine red rubies, and variously colored spinels are associ- ated with the Indus suture zone running through Hunza and Gilgit  to Swat.8 In fact, ruby deposits in the rocks at Haldeikish almost led  to the destruction of the graffiti and petroglyphs.9 Gemstones associ- ated with pegmatite deposits in areas between Gilgit and Skardu and  in the Hindu Kush near Chitral include a blue variety of beryl, many  types of multicolored tourmalines, topaz, feldspar (moonstone), and  quartz.10 Many types of crystal, a favorite material for reliquaries and  carved geese (hamsa), are also found in northern Pakistan.11 The main  sources for lapis lazuli were located in the valley of the Kokcha River  in Badakhshan (northeastern Afghanistan), which was linked to the  upper Indus region via Chitral.  6 Gansser 1964: 29; Kreutzmann, Hermann. 1993. “Challenge and Response in the  Karakoram: Socioeconomic Transformation in Hunza, Northern Areas, Pakistan.”  Mountain Research and Development 13.1, 22; Miller, Keith. 1982.

However, as water levels increase  due to melting snow during the summer (mid-May to mid-October),  the swollen torrents of these rivers become treacherous to cross.12 Since  the rivers are much easier to ford after water levels recede, the period  from October to January was probably the time of maximum mobility  in the upper Indus region.13 If conditions were unsuitable for crossing  turbulent rivers or snowbound passes, travelers had to delay crossing  the rivers and mountain passes until conditions became relatively safe.  Many concentrations of inscriptions and rock drawings mark impor- tant junctions where travelers may have been temporarily forced to  stop while waiting for the right conditions to proceed onwards. In  connection with the location of Buddhist petroglyphs and inscriptions  at a crossing of the Indus River near Chilas, Aurel Stein observed: The possibility of risks run at these crossings, when the Indus in the  early spring and summer carries down its mighty floods, might also have  served to stimulate such acts of devotion or gratitude. (1944: 22)14 Karl Jettmar, who followed in Stein’s footsteps but was able to explore  sites in the region more thoroughly, also suggested that dangerous  river crossings motivated travelers to make images and write graffiti: In olden times as well as up to the twentieth century this was a maneu- ver of considerable risk. You prayed before you started and you offered  thankful gifts when you had succeeded. (1979: 920) Jettmar proposed that “the valleys on both sides of the Indus must have  been a series of seasonal ‘waiting rooms’ for travelers” (1989: xxvii). 12 Jettmar, Karl. 1979. “Rock-carvings and Stray Finds in the Mountains of North  Pakistan: Archaeology before Excavation.” In Taddei, Maurizio, ed.

Very difficult routes through the deep gorges of  the Indus River now followed by the KKH in the Kohistan district of  NWFP are described by Chinese pilgrims as the “Hanging Passages.”15  This was the most direct way from the upper Indus to the Swat val- ley, but long-distance traders probably followed less dangerous routes  which were open during restricted periods.16 A route from Mansehra  which passes through the Kagan Valley and over the Babusar Pass  to Chilas is only open during the summer because accumulations of  snow prevent passage during other seasons. Therefore, travelers com- ing from the upper Indus had to wait until May or June to use this  route, while travelers coming from Mansehra, Kashmir, or points fur- ther to the South (such as Taxila) needed to begin their journeys by  August.17 During his expeditions to eastern Central Asia in the early twen- tieth century, Aurel Stein explored routes through the upper Indus  region used by earlier Chinese pilgrims.18 On his first expedition from  Kashmir to Central Asia in 1900, Stein followed the ‘Gilgit Transport  Road’ through the Astor valley, which was built in 1890–92 to supply  British military campaigns in Gilgit, Chitral and Hunza. Although he  commented that this route “. . . is marked out by nature as the most  accessible line of communication from Kashmir to the Dard territo- ries northward” (1907: 1.1), he later realized that other routes between  Kashmir and Chilas were more practical than the difficult route of the  15 Jettmar locates the “Hanging Passages” between Sazin and Jalkot, where “the  dangerous part of the journey came to an end” (1987a: 99).  16 Klimburg, Max. 1982. “The Setting: The Western Trans-Himalayan Crossroads.”  In Klimburg-Salter, Deborah, ed.

Traditional caravan routes from Khotan and Yarkand  in the southern Tarim Basin crossed the Karakorum (5575 m) and  Muztagh (5370 m) passes in the eastern Karakorum range to Ladakh  and Baltistan. While these routes across the Karakorum Pass contin- ued to be used until the third quarter of the nineteenth century, at  least four other passes over 5000 meters had to be crossed, and the  journey over several barren stretches took about a month to complete  in one direction.21 Since the eastern Karakorum routes were extremely  difficult, routes further to the west through the Pamir range were more  likely choices. Pamir routes were “the safest and quickest way across the stupen- dous mountain barriers between Central Asia and India” (Klimburg  1982: 33). According to Klimburg, “Probably the most important  among the ancient trails from the Pamirs down into Gandhāra fol- lowed the Chitral Valley” (1982: 28). Song Yun and Huisheng probably  followed these routes on their journey between Chitral (She-mi), Swat  (Wu-chang), and Gandhāra around 519–20 CE.22 A route through the  Yarkhun valley in the eastern Hindu Kush of present-day northeast- ern Afghanistan and the Chitral Valley in northwestern Pakistan pro- vided connections to the capillary network of the upper Indus region.  The main route to Chitral follows the Kunar River (lower Yarkhun  River) from Jalalabad (ancient Nagarahāra) through Nuristan in east- ern Afghanistan. Several routes converge in Chitral, including a route  19 Stein 1928: 1.4–5; Lorimer, Emily O. 1939. Language Hunting in the Karakoram.

Other  passes provide connections to the Wakhan or Ab-i-Panja valley, one of  the sources of the Oxus River (Amu Darya) which flows through west- ern Central Asia.23 The Baroghil Pass (ca. 3804 m) links the Wakhan  valley to the upper valley of the Yarkhun River, and the Darkot Pass  (ca. 4630 m) connects the upper Yarkhun valley with the upper Yasin  valley.24 The headwaters of the Yarkhun valley are joined via the Kara- mbar Pass (ca. 4188 m) with the Karambar valley, which feeds into  the Ishkoman River near Imit.25 The Karambar valley is connected  with the Wakhan valley via the Khora Bhurt Pass (4630 m) and with  the Chupursan valley via the Chilinji Pass (5247 m).26 The interlinked  network of high mountain passes was intermittently used by various  travelers, merchants, pilgrims, and semi-permanent resident commu- nities for crossing the permeable frontiers between Central Asia and  South Asia. Capillary routes through the Yasin and Ishkoman valleys linked Gil- git to the Wakhan valley in northeastern Afghanistan. Although petro- glyphs have been discovered in the Ishkoman valley near Imit, the  paucity of Buddhist rock drawings and visitors’ inscriptions suggests  that routes through these valleys were not as popular as routes through  Hunza-Haldeikish, Gilgit-Alam Bridge, and the upper Indus during  the first millennium CE.27 Nevertheless, epigraphic and archaeological  evidence from sites such as Hatun (five km north of the confluence of  the Ishkoman and Gilgit rivers), Gakuch (across the Gilgit River from  the mouth of the Ishkoman Valley), and Bubur (on the northern bank  of the Gilgit River in Punyal) show that this part of the Gilgit valley  was included in the domain of the Palola Sāshis during the seventh  23 Klimburg 1982: 26, Map 2. 24 Kreutzmann1996: 265, fig. 42; Stein 1928: 1.45–7, figs. 43, 48. 25 Stein 1928: 48–50, figs. 47, 49–50. 26 Stein 1928: 1.50 ff., figs. 51–2, 57, 61.

During the summer, interconnected routes through  side valleys of the Gilgit and Indus rivers allowed ancient travelers  to bypass dangerous river crossings. Paths through the Kar Gah and  Shingai Gah valleys, located west of Gilgit near Naupur, lead over the  main ridge of mountains to watersheds of the Kiner Gah and Hodar  Gah valleys and to petroglyph and graffiti complexes at Thalpan and  Hodar on the northern bank of the upper Indus River.29 The Kar Gah  headwaters are connected with the wide valley of the Khanbari Gah,  which flows into the upper Indus downstream from Thor and Oshi- bat.30 Affluents of the Gilgit/Ghizer River provide possible connections  with the Tangir and Darel valleys, which join the Upper Indus near  Shatial.31 A seasonal route through Mastuj connects Chitral to Gilgit  over the Shandur (ca. 3734 m) and Chamarkhan (4334 m) passes. Stein  noticed rock drawings of stūpas with Brāhmī inscriptions at Pakhtori- dini and near the village of Charrun between Mastuj and Chitral along  this route.32 Another feeder route from the South over the Kachikani  Pass (ca. 4766 m) directly connects the upper Swat Valley to the Gilgit  River.33 Thus, a network of river valleys and mountain passes through  the Pamir and Hindu Kush connect Chitral with Gilgit, Badakhshan,  Swat, and ancient Gandhāra. In addition to these capillary routes through mountain valleys, a  major route follows the Gilgit River downstream to its confluence with  the Indus River near Alam Bridge, where Kharostshsī and Brāhmī graf- fiti along with some petroglyphs mark an important crossing. This  complex is located at a junction of regional routes connecting Gilgit  28 Chapter 2, subchapter: Palola Sāshis of Gilgit: Élite Patrons in a Buddhist Enclave,  especially pp. 176 ff. 29 Connections between these valleys are clearly visible in the NASA Landsat image  in the map of “Rock Carvings and Inscriptions along the Karakorum Highway”  in Jettmar, ed.:1989 [ANP 1]. The colossal image of a Buddha carved from a rock  cliff overlooking the Kar Gah valley indicates the importance of routes through these  valleys. 30 Tsuchiya 1999: 379, map 3. 31 Tsuchiya 1999: 359–61, 380–82, maps 4–6. 32 Stein 1921: 1.37–41, figs. 5–6. 33 Klimburg 1982: 26, map 2. </page> <page sequence="11">  capillary routes of the upper indus 267 with Baltistan through deep gorges of the Indus River (still used as  the main road to Skardu) and with Kashmir across the Deosai plateau  or through the Astor valley. Visitors to this complex who were travel- ing on routes between Hunza, Gilgit, Baltistan, and the upper Indus  probably arrived during the late autumn, winter, or early spring, when  rivers could be crossed safely and temperatures on the valley floor  are bearable. This micro-network of intra-regional capillary routes  between neighboring valleys was used for intra- and interregional  travel and trade. Hunza-Haldeikish is the northernmost major site of graffiti and  petroglyphs. West of Hunza is the Ishkoman valley of the Ghizar dis- trict, and southeast of Hunza is the Shigar valley of Baltistan. Nager  is located directly across from Hunza on the southern and eastern  side of the Hunza river. To the south, the KKH connects Hunza with  Gilgit and extends to the north through Sost via the Khunjerab pass  (ca. 4600 meters) to Tashkurgan. From the Wakhan valley, the Irshad  Unwin Pass (ca. 4926 m) is connected to the headwaters of the Chu- pursan valley, which joins the upper Hunza River.34 The Mintaka (ca.  4629 m) and Kilik (ca. 4755 m) passes also provide access from the  Misgar valley of northern Hunza to the Taghdumbash Pamir area  of southwestern Xinjiang.35 In addition to routes over the Mintaka,  Kilik, and Khunjerab passes and through the Chupursan valley which  closely follow affluents of the upper Hunza River, paths over the Shim- shal pass and a difficult trek over the Hispar glacier to Baltistan may  have also served as minor feeder routes to the Hunza valley during  various periods. Although the reputation of Hunzakuts (residents of  Hunza) as infamous raiders of caravans discouraged travelers from  passing through the valley in pre-colonial periods, Haldeikish graf- fiti show that these routes were widely used in the early- to mid-  first millennium CE. Because of its strategic location on trans-Asian  routes crossing the Karakorum mountains, Hunza is not an isolated  and remote utopia impervious to change, but an important crossroads  affected by outside influences throughout its history. Capillary routes  through the Hunza Valley must have always been difficult due to con- stantly shifting glaciers, avalanches and landslides, steep paths through  34 Stein 1928: 1.51–2. 35 Stein observed that the Kilik and Mintaka passes “can be crossed, even with laden  animals, during the greater part of the year” (1907: 1.21). </page> <page sequence="12"> 268 chapter five narrow canyons, and swollen rivers and streams during periods of  snowmelt. Although the Hunza route was an important capillary  through the Northern Areas, it was not the only possibility nor was  it always the most practical choice. Capillary routes across the Kara- korum and Pamir ranges provided relatively quick and direct con- nections between the long-distance trade routes of the northwestern  Indian subcontinent and Central Asia. Despite the difficulties of these  routes over the Pamirs to northern Pakistan, “A shortcut between Cen- tral and South Asia was possible, partly compensating for the dangers  and strains” (Jettmar 1989: xxvii). Graffiti, Petroglyphs, and Pilgrims About 5000 graffiti and over 30,000 petroglyphs written and abraded  onto rocks along capillary routes in the upper Indus region demon- strate remarkable mobility across the high mountain terrain. Visitors  and local residents created designs and wrote brief inscriptions by  abrading (rather than incising) the dark surfaces of rocks with pointed  stones or metal implements. The dark patina, called “desert varnish,”  is formed by a combination of the autochthonous process of iron and  manganese leaching from the interior to the surface of the rocks over  thousands of years to develop a smooth coat and the allochthonous  action of windblown sand and dust in the arid mountain desert envi- ronment which creates a shiny exterior polish.36 As in Native Ameri- can petroglyphs, the repatination of the lighter lines of drawings and  inscriptions preserves a contrast with the older desert varnish. This  process of repatination can sometimes indicate the relative chronol- ogy of petroglyphs and inscriptions, but rates of repatination of desert  varnish vary widely from place to place and even from rock to rock  depending on geology and orientation to the sun. Jettmar, relying on  his own experience with prehistoric carvings, estimated that full repa- tination of petroglyphs takes three or four millennia, but this figure  depends on exposure to the sun as well as the quality of the rocks.37 36 Whalley, W.B. 1983. “Desert Varnish.” In Goudie, Andrew, and Kenneth Pye,  eds. 1983.

Lorimer, had little interest  in the antiquities of the Gilgit district.39 Subsequent explorations of  the upper Indus valley confirmed that these earlier discoveries were  “the tip of an iceberg.”40 After the completion of the Karakorum High- way (KKH) connecting Pakistan and China in 1979, Karl Jettmar and  Ahmad Hasan Dani initiated efforts to document rock drawings and  inscriptions in the Northern Areas of Pakistan.41 Studies of selected  inscriptions and petroglyphs, including analysis of their historical,  religious, and artistic significance, have been published in volumes  of Antiquities of Northern Pakistan.42 Nine volumes of Materialien  zur Archäologie der Nordgebiete Pakistans (MANP) published to date  thoroughly document petroglyphs and graffiti at Oshibat, Shatial,  Hodar, Shing Nala and Gichi Nala, Dadam Das, and Chilas Bridge /  Thalpan.43 These publications supply crucial data for examining the  nature of long-distance trade and religious transmission in northern  Pakistan. Brāhmī, Kharostshsī, Sogdian, Bactrian, Chinese, Tibetan, and Hebrew  inscriptions provide concrete evidence for cross-cultural contact, reli- gious dynamics, and linguistic change.

Onomastic patterns in Kharostshsī and Brāhmī  inscriptions reveal a mixture of Indian, Iranian and indigenous  proper names reflecting the cultural diversity of travelers and residents  who wrote graffiti and drew petroglyphs. Formulae of arrival with  various expressions for “x arrived (here)” explicitly refer to travel,  with records of visitors from as far away as Mathura.44 Unlike dona- tive inscriptions at Bharhut, Sāñcī, and caityas in western India with  numerous references to merchants and traders, graffiti from northern  Pakistan rarely include titles specifying the visitors’ occupations. Con- sequently, very few travelers are explicitly designated as merchants,  apart from vansij (vansī) (Oshibat 82:2) and sārthavāha (sarthavahasya)  (Shatial 39:23).45 About 600 Sogdian, Bactrian and Iranian inscriptions provide strong  evidence for the use of long-distance routes through the upper Indus  between the third to seventh centuries.46 Although occupational titles  rarely appear in Sogdian graffiti in northern Pakistan, toponyms and  personal names derived from places near Samarkand and ethnonyms  connected with China and Kucha suggest that many of these travel- ers were merchants involved in long-distance trade between Sogdia,  northern Pakistan, the Tarim Basin, and China.47 Sogdian inscriptions  have also been found in Ladakh, including a record dated in year  210 (perhaps corresponding to 841/2 CE) of “Caitra of Samarkand,  together with the [Buddhist] monk Nōsh-farn, sent as messengers to  the Qaghan of Tibet” (Sims-Williams 1993: 158–9, no. 2, pls. 2–6).48  Sogdian travelers who reached Ladakh and Tibet probably followed  routes along the upper Indus through northern Pakistan.

The Chinese inscription of “[Gu] Wei-long, envoy of Great Wei, now  dispatched to Mi-mi” (Ma Yong 1989: 144, pl. 217) records the visit  by an official envoy of the Northern Wei dynasty to Hunza-Haldeikish  while traveling to the Sogdian center of Maymurgh around 451 CE.50  Tibetan inscriptions in Gakuch, Baltistan, Ladakh, and Hunza-Hal- deikish show that Tibetan influence extended westwards to the upper  Indus, Hunza, Gilgit, and Yasin valleys.51 A set of Hebrew inscriptions  at the “Campsite” complex on the upper Indus River between Chilas  and Oshibat records the names of Jewish merchants who may have  replaced Sogdians as long-distance trading partners with Hindu mer- chants in Kashmir in the ninth century.52 Petroglyphs from prehistoric periods to the present time repre- sent a wide spectrum of styles, motifs and images ranging from very  common simplified drawings of mountain goats (caprini) to skillful  renderings of Buddhist stūpas, portraits, and narratives. Each site has  its own distinctive characteristics—concentrations of zoomorphic  petroglyphs may indicate hunting grounds or trails into the moun- tains where game was available, while drawings and inscriptions at  complexes located near settlements were more likely to have been  produced by local inhabitants than visitors. Indian, Iranian, and indig- enous elements adopted in petroglyphs indicate patterns of religious  and cultural transmission.

For  example, unusual drawings of Harītī and images of Vāsudeva-Krssnssa  and Baladeva-Balarāma labeled with relatively early Kharostshsī inscrip- tions at the site of Chilas II are quite distinctive, and shed light on  the multiple religious proclivities of visitors, who were not exclusively  Buddhist.53 (Fig. 5.1) Although Buddhist images are less numerous than other types of  drawings at most sites, they provided locative focii for Buddhist ven- eration at outdoor shrines, attracted travelers and local devotees who  added their names in proximity to the drawings, and indicate routes  of transmission. Such “relics of instruction” (uddeśika dhātu) in the  form of drawings of stūpas, Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and narrative  scenes established a Buddhist presence in areas without the resources  (at least initially) to support residential monastic communities. In lieu  of building monasteries and constructing stūpas with “bodily relics”  (śarīra) or “relics of use” (pāribhogika dhātu), itinerant monks, artists,  and local donors drew Buddhist images on rocks and recorded their  donations of “religious offerings” (devadharma) with inscriptions. The  drawings concentrated at dangerous river crossings or in way stations  below mountain passes attracted traders, travelers, and local devotees  who wrote their names in proximity to the images at wayside shrines  (caityas). Gifts of rudimentary stūpa images and more elaborate petro- glyphs generated merit and expanded opportunities for worshipping  and remembering the Buddha. Petroglyphs of ornate stūpas, jātakas,  scenes from the life of the Buddha, and images of various bodhisat- tvas correspond more closely to Buddhist architectural and icono- graphical patterns. The standardization of Buddhist images in some  rock drawings was probably due to closer contact with other Buddhist  artistic traditions than was previously the case in earlier stages of long- distance transmission. Literary accounts of Chinese pilgrims corroborate epigraphic and  petroglyphic evidence for trans-regional movement to and from South  Asia on these particular capillary routes from the fourth to eighth  centuries.

After leaving Khotan, he visited the mountain kingdom of  Jiecha, “in the midst of the Onion range” (Legge 1886: 23), possibly  located at Tashkurgan in southwestern Xinjiang, close to Skardu in  Baltistan, or in Ladakh.54 After crossing the Onion mountains, Faxian  visited Tuo-li, where a large wooden image of Maitreya was venerated  by neighboring kings.55 Archaeological remains of such a shrine have  not been found, but Tuo-li may have been located in a valley of an  54 Tashkurgan is generally accepted as the location of Jiecha (Kuwayama 1987:  711), but locations in Baltistan (Deeg, Max. 2000. “On the localisation of Faxian’s  kingdom of Jiecha.” In Taddei and De Marco 2000: 877–888) and Ladakh (Legge  1886: 18, n. 2; 22, n. 3) correspond more closely to the report that Faxian and his fel- low travelers “went westwards [from Jiecha] towards North India, and after being on  the way for a month, they succeeded in getting across and through the range of the  Onion mountains” (Legge 1886: 24). While travelers could proceed to the West from  Tashkurgan to Wakhan, in other Chinese sources Tashkurgan is named Khe-ban-tuo/ Han-ban-tuo (corresponding to Kharvandan in Sogdian), which makes an identifica- tion between Jie-cha and Tashkurgan unlikely.  55 Legge 1886: 24–5; Li 2002: 168. </page> <page sequence="18"> 274 chapter five upper Indus tributary between Shatial and Chilas. From Tuo-li, Faxian  traversed the difficult “Hanging Passage” (xuan du): From here they traveled southwest along the mountain range for fifteen  days on a difficult path that was full of obstacles. The crags rose to a  formidable height and there was nothing bu precipitous rocks towering  high in the mountains. One would feel dizzy when looking down from  above, and there was no foothold for proceeding along the way. Below  flowed a river called the Indus. The ancients had hewn a stairway-like  path out of the rocks that has seven hundred steps. After climbing the  stairway, the party crossed the river by walking carefully over a rope  suspension bridge. The banks of the river were nearly eighty paces apart.  (translated by Li 1996: 168)56 Zhimeng, another Chinese Buddhist pilgrim who left Chang-an (mod- ern Xian) in 404 CE, followed roughly the same route as Faxian from  Khotan though Ji-sha (Jie-cha in Faxian’s account) to Bo-lun.57 There,  nine of the fourteen monks accompanying Zhimeng turned back to  China and the Indian monk who was probably their guide died of  fatigue.58 After crossing the “Snowy mountains” (Himalaya) and the  Indus River, Zhimeng reached Jibin (probably Gandhāra rather than  Kashmir). Other Chinese monks named Dharmavikrama and Hui-lan  also journeyed from China to Jibin, probably through Bolor, the upper  Indus, the Hanging Passages, Swat, and Gandhāra, to worship the relic  of the Buddha’s bowl at Nagarahāra in the fifth century.59 The journey of Song Yun and Huisheng followed similar routes  from the southern Tarim Basin to Swat and Gandhāra between 518– 522 CE. Although he probably did not visit Bo-lu-le east of Chitral,  Song Yun described the direct route from Swat in terms similar to  Faxian’s description: One has to cross iron-chain bridges across bottomless chasms; there is  nothing to hold on to, and at any moment one may suddenly fall 10,000  56 Xuan du can be localized in the gorge of the Indus river between Sazin and  Besham in Kohistan, as recognized by Stein 1942: 54–55 and Jettmar 1987a: 95–101  (= 2002: 174–181).  57 Kuwayama cautions that Hui-jao, who edited Zhi-meng’s biography, “. . . was  quite careless of precise locations of North Indian kingdoms, or had little knowledge  about Indian geography . . .” (1987: 711, n. 27). Nevertheless, the geographical position  of Bo-lun between Jisha/Jiecha and Jibin is consistent with other accounts. 58 Bagchi, Prabodh Chandra. 1981.

This is why travelers abandon their journeys at the sight of it.  (Jenner 1981: 261) According to Kuwayama (1987: 718, 721), later Chinese pilgrims fol- lowed routes further west towards Bactria and away from the infa- mous “Hanging Passage” in subsequent periods. Xuanzang probably did not pass through the upper Indus region  during his travels in Central Asia and India from 627—645 CE, but he  described the route from Swat to the Indus River: The roads are craggy and steep; the mountains and the valleys are dark  and gloomy. Sometimes we have to cross by ropes, sometimes by iron  chains stretched (across the gorges). There are foot-bridges (or covered  ways) suspended in the air, and flying bridges across the chasms, with  wooden steps let into the ground for climbing the steep embankments.  (Beal 1884: 1.133) Xuanzang also provided detailed information about the Maitreya  image in Da-li-luo, where, according to his sources, gold and turmeric  were found and where the former capital of Udsdsiyāna was located.  A route led from Da-li-luo along the Indus River to Bo-lu-luo in the  middle of the Snowy Mountains, which could be reached “by the help  of flying bridges and footways made of wood across the chasms and  precipices” (Beal 1884: 134–5). According to Xuanzang, Bo-lu-luo was  long from east to west, narrow from north to south, rich in gold, silver,  wheat, pulse (lentils), and other supplies, continually cold, and inhab- ited by rough people who spoke a somewhat different language writ- ten in similar letters to those used in India. The secondhand nature of  this information is probably the reason why Xuanzang does not refer  to the Palola Sāshi rulers of this region, whose support of Buddhist  scholarship in the seventh century was contemporary with Xuanzang’s  visit to Swat. Huizhao, a Korean monk who visited India around 723–727 CE,  traveled from Kashmir to Bolor, which at that time was divided into  Greater Bolor (fifteen days’ journey northeast of Kashmir) controlled  by Tibetans, and Lesser Bolor (seven days’ journey northwest of Kash- mir) under Chinese dominion. Huizhao’s account includes some infor- mation about the customs, dress and hairstyles of the local inhabitants  of Lesser Bolor. He also referred to poor economic conditions: The poor are many and the rich are few. The valleys are narrow and  cultivable lands are limited. The mountains are withered and sterile, with  no trees or grass. (Yang 1985: 48) </page> <page sequence="20"> 276 chapter five Huizhao’s account of impoverishment contrasts sharply with the infor- mation in Xuanzang’s report from about one century earlier. While  some elements may be exaggerated (e.g. “no trees or grass”), the region  of Lesser Bolor may have indeed experienced economic and military  catastrophes leading to the downfall of the Palola Sāshis during the  eighth century. Persian and Arabic texts supply details about the routes followed by  merchants traveling between Central Asia and Northwest India. Hsudūd  al-‘Ālam (“Regions of the World”), a Persian geography written in 982  CE, contains information about routes connecting western Central  Asia with Kashmir through the present Northern Areas of Pakistan.  Merchants and other travelers followed routes from the Oxus River  through Badakhshan and the Wakhan corridor to Bolor in northern  Pakistan.60 The description of Bolor (Persian Bulūr, corresponding to  Chinese Bo-lu-luo), where “there is no salt but that imported from  Kashmir” (Minorsky 1937: 121, §26.19), occurs between Samarqandāq  (probably Sarhad in Wakhan) and Andrās (tentatively identified with  Dras, about 100 km east of Srinagar on the route between Kashmir and  Ladakh).61 As in later Chinese sources, Bolor proper is distinguished  from “Bolorian Tibet” (Baltistan), where “[t]he people are chiefly mer- chants” (ibid., 93, §11.2). The itinerary in the Hsudūd al-‘Ālam outlines  stages of an west-east network of routes which were probably used by  earlier Sogdian merchants whose names are preserved in upper Indus  graffiti of the third to seventh centuries. Al-Bīrūnī (973–1048 CE) refers to a route between the northwestern  frontier of Kashmir and the upper Indus valley which was very similar  to those itineraries outlined in Hsudūd al-‘Ālam. Following his discus- sion of the people, cities, and rivers of Kashmir, Al-Bīrūnī notes: Leaving the ravine by which you enter Kashmir and entering the plateau,  then you have for a march of two more days on your left the moun- tains of Bolor and Shamīlān. . . . Their towns are Gilgit, Aswira, and  Shiltās . . . (Sachau 1888: 1.207)62 60 Minorsky, Vladimir; trans. 1937.

The route described by Al-Bīrūnī was  the primary entryway to Kashmir through the valley of the Jhelum  River, which could be reached from the Northern Areas through the  Kagan valley and Babusar Pass above Chilas. A Khotanese Śaka itinerary was probably the most popular north- south route between the Tarim Basin, Gilgit, Chilas, and Kashmir dur- ing the tenth century, but it may have been used widely for several  centuries before and after this period.64 Although many places have  not been identified, a significant segment of the route passed through  the Ishkoman, Gilgit and upper Indus valleys.65 The text refers to an  important ford of the Gilgit River at Bubur (Baubuera) in modern  Punyal. The “king’s abode” was in the “great city” of Gilgit (Gīdsagītti),  where eight stone samsghārāmas indicate that Buddhism was still flour- ishing.66 Chilas (Śīlathasa/Śīdsathasi) is referred to as another “great  city” on the Indus River south of Gilgit. From Chilas, the Man ˆgala- cakra bridge could be reached after a journey of eight days, probably  via the Babusar Pass and Kagan Valley. From “the first Indian city  towards Kashmir” (Bailey 1936: 262) located at the bridge near the  confluence of the Kishanganga and Jhelum rivers (close to Muzaffara- bad), the itinerary describes places along the Jhelum River on the route  to Baramula (Varnsavalā) in Kashmir. 63 Bailey 1936: 262; Stein 1900: 2.363; Jettmar, Karl. 1980.

References to surviving Buddhist  monasteries along the route described in this itinerary are examined in Chapter 2,  subchapter: Palola Sāshis: Élite Patrons in a Buddhist Enclave, p. 177. 65 According to Bailey (1936: 260, citing Morgenstierne), the “Blue River” may be  identified with the Ishkoman River (Burushaski sisqam means “blue”), the Sīna is the  Gilgit River (ibid., 261), and the “Golden River” is the Indus (262). Tucci comments  that Golden River “is here certainly not a mere poetical attribute” (1977: 19, fn. 17),  since this region is associated with gold in other literary traditions. 66 Bailey 1936: 262. </page> <page sequence="22"> 278 chapter five Enigma of an Absence of Archaeological Evidence and  Manifestations of Buddhist Presence In contrast to the rich corpus of petroglyphs and inscriptions and  interesting literary references to the upper Indus region, very little  archaeological evidence is available to corroborate the use of this net- work of capillary routes for long-distance trade and religious trans- mission. Aside from stray finds, the archaeological record for this  region is very poor because systematic surveys and excavations have  not been undertaken. Nevertheless, among the most notable discover- ies are items which may have been imported during Saka migrations,  including a bronze rhyton and another bronze vessel from the Ishko- man valley, a bronze plaque from the Kandia valley, and a large golden  ring discovered near Pattan in the Kohistan district of the Indus val- ley.67 The paucity of other items imported through long-distance trade  exchanges may also be due to the tendency of artifacts to be found at  opposite ends of trade route terminals rather than in transit zones. The  absence of archaeological remains of urban centers on routes through  the mountain valleys of northern Pakistan does not necessarily indi- cate that traders bypassed this region in the first millennium CE, but  instead probably relates to the inability of the physical environment to  support large populations in cities. Judging from the meager archaeo- logical remains of stūpas and monasteries in northern Pakistan, the  establishment of large-scale Buddhist institutions in northern Pakistan  did not take place before the middle to late first millennium CE. The following overview begins downriver on the upper Indus at  Shatial and ends at Haldeikish in the Hunza valley. Rather than a  comprehensive survey, the focus of this tour is on inscriptions and  rock drawings that demonstrate a Buddhist presence. Along the way,  other important sites of possible Buddhist stūpa sites and shrines are  noted. The largest concentrations of Buddhist petroglyphs in northern  Pakistan are located south of Hunza-Haldeikish and Alam Bridge in  the upper Indus valley between Chilas and Shatial. 67 Dani, Ahmad Hasan. 1998. “Origin of the Dardic Culture: a new discovery in  the Northern Areas of Pakistan.” Journal of Central Asia 21.1, 158–170; Jettmar 1991;  Litvinsky 1993 [ANP 2]; Neelis 2007: 64–66; Rehman, Saeed ur. 1990.

Across the Indus River from Shatial, pathways through the  Darel and Tangir valleys lead northwards to Gilgit and Chitral, with  further links to Badakhshan and the Oxus watershed in northeastern  Afghanistan. Shatial is distinguished from other upper Indus sites by  almost six hundred Iranian visitors’ inscriptions from the third to sev- enth centuries CE, which were primarily written by Sogdian visitors.69  The longest inscription at Shatial was written by a Sogdian traveler on  his way to Tashkurgan in southwestern Xinjiang: (I), Nanai-vandak, the (son of ) Narisaf, came (here) on the tenth (day/ year) and have requested the favor from the soul of the holy place Kārt  Fig. 5.2: Triptych with a Stūpa and Śibi Jātaka at Shatial (Source: MANP 2,  plate Vb) 68 Bandini-König and Fussman 1997 (MANP 2). 69 Sims-Williams 1989–1992; La Vaissière 2005 [2002]: 79–81. </page> <page sequence="24"> 280 chapter five (that) I reach Kharvandan [Tashkurgan] very fast and see (my) dear  brother in good (health). (no. 36:38, Sims-Williams 1989: 23). Numerous Indian inscriptions written in the Brāhmī (411), Kharostshsī  (15), and Proto-Śāradā (7) scripts suggest that South Asian merchants  met their Sogdian counterparts at this commercial hub or entrepôt.  Drawings of 138 stūpas at Shatial also indicate the religious signifi- cance of this waystation, especially to Buddhist visitors. The most  impressive Buddhist image at Shatial is a large triptych with an intri- cate drawing of a stūpa flanked by an illustration of the Śibi Jātaka  (in which the king of the Śibis holds a bird which he has saved by  cutting off a piece of his own flesh), and an unidentified structure that  may represent another Buddhist narrative, with devotees prostrating  below.70 The depiction of the king of the Śibis as a Buddha deviates  from conventional representations. Based on paleographic analysis of  Sogdian, Brāhmī, and Kharostshsī graffiti densely written within and  around these images, Gérard Fussman dates the drawing to ca. 350  CE. Thus, Shatial served multiple functions as a significant commercial  node and as a wayside shrine where the jātaka story of King Śibi’s self- less gift of his own flesh may have been localized. Oshibat and other “crossing stations” of upper Indus Several important complexes located upstream from Shatial on  the upper Indus are located where tributaries enter the Indus from  side valleys or at river crossings where local, regional, and long-dis- tance travelers drew designs and wrote their names while waiting  to continue their voyages. A mixture of many types of petroglyphs  at the “crossing station” of Oshibat depict animals (especially  caprids, since simple drawings of goats or ibexes are by far the  70 Bandini-König and Fussman 1997: 178–79, Scene 34:A, pl.

Based on palaeo- graphic analysis of graffiti, Fussman (1994b. “Une peinture sur pierre: Le triptyque  au stūpa de Shatial.” In Fussman and Jettmar, ed. 1994 [ANP 3]: 43) dates the draw- ing to c. 350–350 CE.

The crossing at Oshibat was linked to routes on the other bank of the  Indus River, where petroglyphs and inscriptions at Helor Das, Hodar,  and Dadam Das were made by local inhabitants as well as transregional  traders and travelers. Over 130 drawings of stūpas demonstrate popu- lar Buddhist devotion at Hodar. Brāhmī and Proto-Śāradā donative  inscriptions indicate that many drawings were “religious offerings” of  local inhabitants, including a scribe (divīra) named Bhita, who shared  the merit from drawing abstract geometric stūpas with his mother and  father.72 These transformed images of stūpas with only the most basic  features of multiple foundations leading to an apex crowned by a staff,  71 Bandini-König and Bemmann 1994 (MANP 1): 13–14, pls. 24–27. 72 Bandini-König 1999 (MANP 3): nos. 4:1–2, 4:5–8, 6:1–11. </page> <page sequence="26"> 282 chapter five sometimes in the form of a trident, show that simple drawings provided  a focus for veneration and generated merit in essentially the same way  as more elaborate petroglyphs. According to Volker Thewalt: Many of these elaborate rock-carvings must be attributed to highly skilled  craftsmen who received their artistic training in the great monasteries of  Gandhāra, while others are crude imitations, executed by traveling lay- men or the inhabitants of neighboring villages, wishing to gain some  spiritual merit by reproducing these sacred monuments. (1985: 2.782)73 The popularity of drawing and venerating stūpa images at Hodar  contrasts with the relative paucity of Buddhist images at the nearby  site of Dadam Das (only 5 stūpa petroglyphs), which seems to have  functioned as a prehistoric hunting station and border post for long- distance traders such as Dsovala (37:10, 15, 24), who wrote his name  in Brāhmī and Kharostshsī next to an image of an Iranian fire altar (his  name also appears at Shatial 54:24).74 Among the petroglyph “stations” located at the mouths of the Har- ban, Khanbari, Minargah, and Gichi valleys, only the catalog of petro- glyphs and inscriptions at Gichi has been published.75 This site can  be divided between an eastern part with many Buddhist engravings  near the remains of a settlement at the mouth of the Gichi stream  and a western part with a majority of visitors’ inscriptions. Stūpas  with anthropomorphic features included among 77 images of stūpas  on rocks at Gichi Nala are associated with a local devotee named  Sanˆgamitra (nos. 31:1, 3, 4, 5), who seems to have introduced his own  unique innovations into the designs (p. 113). Brāhmī inscriptions pre- dominate, aside from a single inscription in Sogdian and an excep- tional Hebrew inscription (no. 155:4). There are at least 25 examples  of Buddhist dedicatory formulae (with devadharma-, krsta, and dhar- mahetuvarada), and the repetition of the names of some visitors who  wrote their names at other sites allows their routes through the upper  Indus region to be reconstructed. 73 Thewalt, Volker. 1985. “Rockcarvings and Inscriptions along the Indus: The Bud- dhist Tradition.” In South Asian Archaeology. 1983, v.2, eds.

A contrast between abundant stūpa drawings and the  absence of anthropomorphic images of the Buddha at Chilas II leads  Martha Carter to conclude that the Buddha icon was not included  in “the common repertoire of devotional imagery” (Carter 1993: 363)  at this stage in the upper Indus. Iconographic motifs connected with  Buddhist, Hindu, and indigenous traditions shed light on the multiple  Fig. 5.4: Stūpa veneration at Chilas II (Source: ANP 1, plate 22) 76 Bandini-König 2003– (MANP 6–9). 77 Fussman 1989c [ANP 1]: 1–40. </page> <page sequence="28"> 284 chapter five religious proclivities of visitors to this encampment, which was appar- ently not an exclusively Buddhist shrine. (Fig. 5.1) At sites around Thalpan and Chilas a local patron named Kubera- vāhana donated several ornate stūpas as well as visual narratives of  Śākyamuni Buddha’s religious biography. He is portrayed with his  teacher Mitragupta in a detailed drawing of the Vyāghrī Jātaka, a  widespread narrative in which a Bodhisattva (labeled Mahāsattva)  makes a gift of his own body to save a hungry tigress and her cubs.78  Other petroglyphs of the Śibi Jātaka (also illustrated downstream at  Shatial ) and the Rʕsispañcaka Jātaka suggest that these narratives may  have been linked with local or regional sites. Another prominent local  patron named Sinˆhotas donated “religious offerings” (devadharma) of  petroglyphs depicting the Bodhisattvas Avalokiteśvara and Maitreya  along with stūpa drawings at Chilas bridge. Other inscriptions denote  homage to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas associated with the Mahāyāna  such as Amitābha, Aksosbhya, Prabhūtaratna, and Ratnaśikhin.79 The  standardization of Buddhist images in rock drawings donated by  Kuberavāhana and Sinˆhotas at Chilas and Thalpan was probably due to  close contact with Buddhist artistic traditions in neighboring regions  of Swat, Gandhāra, and Kashmir. Shing Nala A shrine at Shing Nala, located approximately thirty km upstream  from Thalpan, has a remarkable concentration of Buddhist petro- glyphs, including 156 stūpas (41% of the total engravings) often  recorded as “religious offerings” in Brāhmī donative inscriptions.80  Most of the Buddhist images and inscriptions are clustered around a  large geological formation that periodically fills with water and serves  as a place to rest in the shade of overhanging rocks. Since Shing Nala  was not located on a major transit route, Ditte Bandini-König (2001:  57–58) hypothesizes that the localization of a Buddhist shrine was tied  78 The petroglyph of the Vyāghrī Jātaka at Chilas was initially published by Stein  1944: 20–21.

If this hypothesis  is correct, Shing Nala was not a “wayside shrine” per se, but primarily  functioned as a pilgrimage place, which became a focus for the devo- tion of visitors who made their own stūpa designs. Designs of elabo- rate stūpas with profuse architectural details and decorative elements  and other complex Buddhist drawings are relatively scarce outside  of Chilas, Thalpan, Shatial, and Shing Nala. Rudimentary images of  stūpas with only the most basic features show that patronage was not  restricted to élite donors. Alam Bridge Kharostshsī and Brāhmī graffiti written on rocks near the confluence  of the upper Indus and Gilgit rivers close to Alam Bridge reflect pat- terns of long-distance travel.81 While there are very few petroglyphs of  stūpas or other images to indicate that this site functioned as a Bud- dhist shrine, personal names and titles clearly indicate that many visi- tors were Buddhist travelers or local devotees. Approximately twenty  percent of the personal names in Kharostshsī and Brāhmī graffiti at  Alam Bridge are composed of Buddhist naming elements. Examples  of Buddhist titles in Brāhmī graffiti include a novice (śrāman sera)  named Asokaksesma, a “Master of Monastic Law” (vinayadhara)  named Ratnaraksista, and a “Śākya monk” (śākyabhiksus) named  Satyaśrestshsi. Brāhmī graffiti recording the visits of Palolajo Bhiksuss  were written by Buddhist monks with regional ethnonyms, since Gil- git and the surrounding valleys were ruled by the Palola Sāshis until  the early eighth century.82 Kharostshsī and Brāhmī graffiti at Alam  Bridge serve as valuable written records of the journeys of agents of  Buddhist transmission. 81 Fussman, Gérard. 1978. “Inscriptions de Gilgit.” Bulletin de l’École française  d’Extrême-Orient 65: 1–64; Humbach, Helmut. 1980a. “Hybrid Sanskrit in the Gil- git Brāhmī Inscriptions.” Studien zur Indologie und Iranistik 5/6: 99–121; Humbach,  Helmut. 1980b. “Die Kharostsīs-Inschriften aus Gilgit.” Münchener Studien zur Sprach- wissenschaft 39: 53–58. 82 Hinüber 2004: 58–59.

Over one hundred Kharostshsī, Brāhmī, Sog- dian, Bactrian, Chinese, and Tibetan inscriptions at Haldeikish pro- vide concrete evidence for the movement of travelers during the first  millennium. Haldeikish is predominated by petroglyphs of mountain  goats (the name of Haldeikish is derived from haldén, the Burushaski  word for a male ibex or a domesticated male goat), which may indi- cate an ongoing connection with hunting expeditions. Four large rock  outcroppings form a conspicuous natural landmark near an important  ford across the Hunza River and provide a convenient resting place for  visitors who drew zoomorphic designs and abraded graffiti into weath- ered patches of desert varnish covering the sandstone and shale sur- faces. Since graffiti at Haldeikish primarily record the arrival of visitors  in epigraphic formulae similar to those used at Alam Bridge and there  are very few Buddhist petroglyphs, this site probably functioned as a  transit station for long-distance travelers rather than a shrine for local  devotees. Nevertheless, Buddhist personal names (appearing in a rela- tively higher proportion of the Kharostshsi inscriptions, which outnum- ber other inscriptions at this site) indicate that Haldeikish belonged to  the capillary network of long-distance routes of Buddhist transmission  between South Asia and Central Asia. Conclusions This upper Indus border region of northern Pakistan was a significant  transit zone for the initial phases of Buddhist transmission beyond  South Asia. The climate and terrain of the high mountain desert envi- ronment severely limited agricultural production. Precious gems and  metals found throughout the mountains of northern Pakistan prob- ably provided a powerful incentive for undertaking difficult jour- neys through the mountains, since there is always a demand for such  high-value/low-volume commodities. Hunting was evidently a major  occupation based on scenes depicted in rock drawings and still has a  meaningful role in local traditions in the Northern Areas of Pakistan.  However, in contrast to more fertile areas of Gandhāra, Swat, and the  Kashmir valley, the material resources of this region were not suffi- </page> <page sequence="31">  capillary routes of the upper indus 287 cient to support large residential Buddhist monasteries. Like the Takla  Makan desert in Xinjiang (to be explored in the following chapter),  the high mountain passes, deep river valleys, and other topographical  features of this region were difficult to traverse in certain seasons. Nev- ertheless, images drawn on rocks located at nodes in networks of cap- illary routes and inscriptions written by visitors to record their arrival  at crossing points clearly indicate that these physical barriers were not  impediments to transregional mobility. Buddhist names written in Kharostshsī and Brāhmī graffiti, various  types of stūpa drawings, illustrations of jātakas and other Buddhist  biographical narratives, and images of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas  reflect different stages in the regional establishment and transmis- sion of Buddhism in the transit zone of northern Pakistan, which was  definitely not devoid of a Buddhist presence. “Religious offerings”  (devadharma/deyadharma) of Buddhist petroglyphs given to wayside  shrines (caityas) localized the presence of the Buddha by acting as  visual commemorative relics for local and itinerant devotees to wor- ship in an environment that could not initially sustain permanent  stūpas and residential monasteries. Chinese accounts of Faxian and  Xuanzang refer to a Buddhist shrine with a colossal wooden image of  the future Buddha Maitreya in the upper Indus region. However, its  location is unknown, and archaeological evidence of local monasteries  mentioned nearby the shrine has not yet been discovered. While Bud- dhist institutions are very well attested by archaeological remains of  stūpas and monasteries in the Swat valley of ancient Udsdsiyāna, socio- economic conditions in the upper Indus apparently did not support  a pattern of monastic settlement before a period of élite patronage by  the Palola Sāshi dynasty of Gilgit from the 7th to early 8th century.  The enigmatic absence of a Buddhist institutional presence before this  period did not mean that Buddhists were missing from the transit zone  of the upper Indus. Instead, this overview of Buddhist petroglyphs  and inscriptions has demonstrated that traders, itinerant monks, and  local patrons began to localize religious topologies and narratives long  before élite patronage led to increased levels of Buddhist literary and  artistic production in Gilgit. </page> <page sequence="32">  </page> </plain_text>
