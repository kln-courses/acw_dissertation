Alison Taylor writes: Cremated remains of a young child dating to the mid-second century A.D. were found in a samian jar in Godmanchester accompanied by three pots, two bangles, bronze and gold box-fittings, and pipe-clay figurines of a bull and a horse. This is the second discovery of a child's burial with clay figures from Cambridgeshire, the first being from Arrington.253 The site lies in a private garden in the centre of Roman Godmanchester and was found accidentally by the owner, Mr G. Reeve, while he was digging garage foundations in 1991, but it was not reported until publication of the Arrington figures alerted him and his evening-class teacher, Susan Oosthuizen, to the importance of his discovery. Other finds noted in flower beds throughout the garden include quantities of Roman pottery dating to the third and fourth centuries, animal bone (including dog), and shellfish including oysters and winkles. These are all assumed to derive from later occupation of the town. A colour photograph taken by Mrs Reeve while the finds were in the ground shows the samian vessel was flanked by two figurines with three other pots emerging nearby in a round pit 0.4-o.5 m in diameter at a depth of just over one metre below ground level. The pit is sealed below later Roman deposits. ______cm 0 crcm cm 0 5 FIG. 14. Metal artefacts from a child burial at Godmanchester. 253 A.

One of the bangles is 55 mm in diameter, made of copper alloy. Formed from a single piece of metal it has snakes' head terminals and a punched-dot decoration visible near the terminal. It was found in two pieces. The second bangle is 56 mm in diameter, made of twisted wire which X-rays showed to be iron wire with a double strand of copper alloy wrapped around it. Its terminals have been lost. It was found in three pieces. Neither bangle would fit anyone other than a child and their presence indicates that the burial is very likely to be a girl. A small hinged-fitting, also made of copper alloy but without corrosion, still has traces of an iron rod in the hollow made by projections bent over to produce a hinge. It is 29 mm long, 17 mm wide, and very thin. Its edges are finely chamfered. A perforation at the end is now empty. As it was found near the top of the cremation, it is possible that this artefact was a decorative hinge on a wooden box inside which all the grave goods were placed. A minute gold rivet, 2 mm in diameter (max.) (unfortunately too small to fit the perforation in the hinged fitting noted above) was also found amongst the cremation. This could also have been a decorative box-fitting. Thepottery (FIG. 15) By C.J. Going I. Neckless jar in a shell-tempered fabric. The rim has two grooves on the interior. The exterior is brown buff in colour, but flame marked to a blackish brown on part of the side wall. The vessel is related in shape to the Essex Thames-side products of the first century A.D., but aspects of the shape of the rim and fabric reveal this vessel to be a product of the Harrold, Bedfordshire, potteries.

The rim and upper body are burnished overall, as is the lower body. The mid-body is left unsmoothed or burnished, save for a lightly tooled latticing. Probably from an Essex source. 3. Small bead-rimmed dish (Camulodunum, form 37). The vessel is burnished overall, and decorated with a lightly applied lattice to the exterior. Hadrianic-early Antonine in date. 4.

In sum, these four vessels (particularly the bead-rimmed dish, No. 3 above) suggest that the burial dates to some time in the middle quarters of the second century, which fits well with the possible date of manufacture of the figures. The figurines By Miranda Green This discovery of a child's burial with clay figures is comparable to the Arrington grave which contained a number of statuettes including a mother-goddess of Rhenish type, two rams, and a fragmentary bullock. The Godmanchester find appears to belong to a similar burial tradition, albeit with fewer grave-goods than Arrington. The much earlier discovery of a burial with pipe-clay figurines at Colchester is usually interpreted as that of a child, but examination of the cremated remains and other grave goods indicate that this was the burial of a high-ranking woman.254 This burial contained a clay triple-horned bull. o 5 cm FIG.

The figure measures 150 mm maximum length and it stands on a plinth similar to that of the horse found with it and also that of the Arrington rams. The bull is deep chested, heavily built and with folds of demarcated flesh running down from the back of the head to the chest. The figure is unusual in that it represents a 'taurus intactus', an uncastrated bull rather than an ox or bullock. The Arrington example is a bullock, as is a Gaulish clay figurine from Clermont-Ferrand (Puy-de-D6me).255" The Godmanchester bull wears a band around the middle of its body, generally interpreted as representing a fillet which would have been placed upon a real bull as part of a pre-sacrificial ritual, an act which designated the animal as a gift to the gods. The triple-horned bull at Colchester wears this band,256 as do bronze bulls from Gaulish contexts.257 The horse (FIG. 17) The horse figurine is once again undamaged and stands on a flat plinth. Its maximum length is 140 mm. The animal is of light build, with a slim body and long, delicate muzzle. There is a pronounced mane of stiff, straightish hair. The animal bears no trace of saddle or bridle. A very close parallel is a Gaulish 0 5 FIG. 17. Horse figurine from a child burial at Godmanchester. 255 M.

The Godmanchester horse was clearly never part of a horse-and-rider group such as is known, for example, at Great Chesterford (Essex).261 The sex of the horse is not indicated and this may mean that a mare or gelding rather than a stallion is represented. Discussion of the figurines The two clay figures form part of the great group of mass-produced statuettes which were manufactured in central and north-western Gaul and the Rhineland during the first two centuries A.D.262 Most of the figurines thus produced were for religious or ritual use: representations of Venus or a seated mother- goddess were the most popular type and these were bought as a cheap alternative to bronze, as votive gifts to be offered in sanctuaries or private house-shrines or to be buried with the dead. Nevertheless the question must be raised as to whether clay animals found in the graves of children represent votive offerings or were present as toys. However, it is unlikely that they had a primary function as toys: animal-figures occur in shrines, and the Godmanchester bull appears to represent a sacrificial victim. The Colchester bull is triple-horned, a characteristically Celtic sacred animal, and the many animal figurines from this grave accompany an adult rather than a child. If the Godmanchester figures were placed in the child's tomb as a religious act, what was their precise significance within a sepulchral context? The bull and the horse may represent offerings to particular divinities: for instance horses (especially mares) were sacred to Epona, and a number of cults associated with horsemen are known, particularly in eastern Britain.263 Bulls were associated with a variety of deities, including the Roman Jupiter and the Gaulish Cernunnos.264 Sometimes, as at Colchester, they bear three horns, and in addition to the symbolism of the animal itself, bull-horned anthropomorphic images which occur in both Gaul and Britain indicate the reverence with which the bull could be held.265 Both bulls and horses were closely associated with rites of sacrifice. One good example of this is the pre-Roman Iron Age sanctuary at Gournay-sur-Aronde (Oise),266 which was the focus for elaborate animal-ritual. The bodies of horses which had died in maturity were exposed and their bones placed in distinct groups within the sacred enclosure ditch. The bulls or oxen were slaughtered according to a very precise ritual but only when they had reached old age (thirteen or fourteen years). They were placed in a large decomposition pit in the centre of the sanctuary for about six months after which their skulls were placed at the entrance of the shrine and their bones deliberately positioned within the ditch. In Romano- British and Gaulish religious practice, animal-sacrifice seems to have consisted very largely of domestic species, with wild creatures forming only a tiny proportion of the faunal record. Cattle, sheep, pigs, and horses were the commonest sacrificial victims. It is very possible that the pipe-clay figures in the Godmanchester grave represent the sacrifice of a horse and bull as gifts to the infernal gods, perhaps because the family could not afford to purchase live beasts as funerary offerings. Even if the statuettes were not meant as substitutes for sacrificial victims, they may nonetheless have been placed in the tomb as symbols of wealth and prosperity. Both cattle and horse were crucial to the Iron Age and Romano- Celtic economies: cattle were used as units of wealth in early historic Ireland, and this is reflected in many of the Insular myths, such as the Thin B6 Cuailnge (the Cattle Raid of Cooley).267 Horses were important for transport, both of humans and goods, and they were also perceived as prestigious creatures, symbols of rank and closely associated with Celtic warfare.268 So the choice of a bull and a 258 Rouvier-Jeanlin, op. cit.

The display of rank was perhaps important both as a symbolic statement to witnesses present at the child's funeral and in order to ensure an appropriate welcome in the Otherworld. The cremation By Corinne Duhig The samian beaker was filled with a mass of concreted soil and small bone fragments which were loosened and removed by pipetting industrial methylated spirit on the surface and removing the bone with tweezers. Most fragments are white, except parts of the skull vault from the area close to the coronal suture and two rib fragments, which are a bright greyish-blue, indicating the presence of residual organic matter. Green marks on the skull base presumably indicate the previous proximity of copper alloy. That the body was that of a child is indicated by the small size of the bones and the unfused long-bone epiphyses, and an age over three years can be established by the presence of the first cuneiform and the fusion of vertebral arches to bodies in the cervical spine. The upper age limit is problematical, long-bone epiphyses fusing at puberty, but the small size being that of a much younger individual. The presence of a fusing distal epiphysis for the first metatarsal-the appearance of this, usually absent, third centre of ossification being a variant of normal development-points to an age of at least seven or eight years, but its age of fusion is not indicated269 because of the small size. Altogether it seems unlikely that the child was much older than seven or eight. The sex cannot be determined from immature remains. No pathological conditions are evident. A bird femur found loose on top of the vase fill is unburnt and probably is a modern intrusion. OTHER ROMAN BURIALS FROM GODMANCHESTER Roman burials have been found near Godmanchester since at least 1905, when eight urned cremations were found at Green End,270 and the Cambridgeshire Sites and Monuments Record has numerous records of inhumations noted in gardens, housing developments, and new roads around the town. The largest number are inhumations, nearly all of which have been ascribed to the third or fourth centuries. Apart from an articulated arm and other bones found in a rubbish pit near the mansio most were found outside the town defences which consisted of a large dyke from the second century, with walls built in the late third century,271 and are commonly associated with Roman roads. An exception is an early second- century family cremation group consisting of two adult cremations, one in an urn with a flagon and one in an elaborate wooden chest in a wooden box accompanied by a flagon, beaker, cup and dish surrounded by four infant inhumations, found in the centre of the town in back premises of a Roman strip building in St Ann's Lane.272 The main concentrations of inhumations have been found at Park Lane, north-west of the Roman town, and London Road to the south, both influenced by the presence of Ermine Street. Unfortunately most of these were badly recorded, usually because they were found during construction work, and archaeologists, if they were informed at all, were only able to rescue occasional skeletons without adequate recording. It is possible that well over a hundred burials were lost in this way while housing estates were built at London Road for example.273 More recent finds promise to be more informative. In 1991, for example, human bones were found accidentally during development in London Street, just outside the Roman town walls. Emergency work by the County Council Archaeology Section eventually revealed 13 inhumations. All lay east-west, with heads to the west. At least three were buried in nailed coffins and all lay equally spaced in rows in regularly cut graves. No grave goods were found 269 T.P. Pick and R.

All were adult, and examination of their bones revealed traces of disease and trauma including degenerative disease in the spine, many well-healed fractures to the ribs and legs, dental caries, abscesses, tooth loss, arthritis, caused both by degenerative disease and infection, and the possibility of leprosy in one skeleton.274 In 1992 the Archaeology Section had another opportunity to investigate human remains when assessing the preservation of archaeological remains at The Parks before development.275 Five inhumations, in addition to many other Roman features, were noted, not far from the site of earlier discoveries. Again, all lay east-west, all but one having the head to the west. One girl was buried with a pair of copper-alloy bangles on her wrists. Only one skeleton was fully excavated and examined for pathology. She was about 22-5 years old, 5 ft (1.54 m) tall, with dental disease and degenerative arthritis. Slight lipping of joints suggests the stress of energetic activity, both upper arms showed the strong development of muscular markings. Other skeletal evidence suggested an inadequate diet in early life, followed by a much richer one later on. As noted generally in Godmanchester cemeteries, where adequate recording was possible, burials conformed to Philpott's 'managed' graves, i.e. extended supine inhumations, with east-west orientation, and evidence for coffins, with grave-goods generally restricted to young women.276 274 L.

These are fairly reliably ascribed to the first and second centuries A.D., although the early find of eight cremations of Green End noted above was associated with coins of second and third centuries. All are outside the town limits. The most interesting were 55 urned cremations found at Rectory Farm in 1990 in advance of gravel quarrying. They were associated with twenty-two flagons, eight jars, five beakers, and seven samian dishes. There was also one cremation in a glass jar, and four inhumations.277 Publication by the Central Archaeological Service will include analysis of both vessels and human remains. CONCLUSION Apart from some accompanying vessels, such as those from Rectory Farm, there are no similarities between the cremation in this article and any others in Godmanchester. Burials with pipe-clay figurines are thoroughly discussed by Miranda Green in the report on the Arrington burial,278 which is itself by far the closest parallel to the Godmanchester grave, and also has the same date-range. Association between the two burials is primarily Ermine Street, and it is worth noting pipe-clay figurines (human not animal) in graves near its terminals in London and York. The communication network clearly encouraged exotic imports. However, whereas Arrington stood out as 'foreign' because of aromatic resins and gods and a goddess from around the Roman Empire, Godmanchester is only really unusual for its animal figurines and its location within the town. The second century was a time of growth and prosperity in Godmanchester, with mansio and temples built at this time, the road network, including Ermine Street, renewed and much re-building after a major fire in the middle of the century.279 It is easy to imagine that the bereaved family, perhaps travellers staying at the mansio, did not know the town well, and therefore made use of a convenient plot just within the defences, which at the time consisted only of a large dyke.280 At the same time, the comparative wealth of this cremation with accompanying vessels, jewellery, evidence for a casket, and Gaulish/Germanic figures, is a late example indicative of direct importation of Gallo-Belgic traditions to burial practice in the Essex-Herts-Cambridgeshire region, a characteristic which is recognisable in late Iron Age and early Roman finds.281 40 Hertford Street, Cambridge 277 F.
