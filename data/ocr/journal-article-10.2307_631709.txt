<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTICES OF BOOKS lack of sufficient contextual evidence, a Campo estab- lished normative 'types' through multivariate analysis of selected formal characteristics of the figurines. Using the computer-based technique of multidimensional scaling (MDS), she is able to differentiate fundamental formal elements from less significant stylistic or decorative features. Two classes of coroplastic figurines have been chosen for the analysis: the Chalcolithic cruciforms well known from sites such as Kissonerga, Lemba, Erimi and Souskiou in the southwest of the island; and the so- called 'plank idols' of the Early Bronze Age, found primarily in the large cemetery sites of Lapithos and Vounous on the north coast. For the former, the norma- tive type yielded by MDS is a squatting female; other features, such as elongated necks, tilted heads, and outstretched arms, are secondary elements that account for variations on the standard type. For the plank figures, only the plank shape itself emerges as the standard element. Unlike the generic Chalcolithic types, plank figurines are highly individualized, as indicated by numerous variations in dress, headgear, facial markings, and personal ornamentation. C. adopts a two-pronged approach to the interpreta- tion of these artefacts. In the first chapter of the book, symbolic and functional aspects of representational art, in particular anthropomorphic figurines, are explored. Figurines, like other classes of artefact, have been designed and used for the purpose of fulfilling real social needs; as symbols of the cultural systems that created them, they both reflect and influence underlying social structures. In the second chapter, an overview of the Neolithic, Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age cultures of the island is intended to serve as an historical and contextual backdrop to the interpretation of the symbolic patterns presented by the figurines. In the absence of direct contextual evidence, it is argued, the function and meaning of the figurines can best be interpreted by relating their fundamental formal elements to basic needs for survival. The latter, of course, are influenced by other aspects of culture such as social organization and method of subsistence. Thus for the Chalcolithic cruciforms, the basic formal element (a squatting female) is interpreted as a generalized symbol of female fertility reflecting the need of small scale societies for successful procreation. The more detailed, individualized plank types of the Early Bronze Age are linked to a very different symbolic system, one that has evolved from the generic concept of fertility to reflect the emergence of specific, elite social groups. It is further suggested (following Talalay's work on Neolithic figurines from Greece) that the plank figures may have been used in marriage contracts as part of patrilocal, exogamic practices. While C.'s fresh approach to the material is to be commended, her results fall short of the goals set forth in the introductory chapters. In the first place, the book (a delayed publication of her doctoral dissertation) is out of date with regard to recent archaeological material from Cyprus. Although major developments occurring in the field from the late 1980's are outlined in an adden- dum at the back of the book, these do not include discoveries made since 1990; nor are the results of any of these discoveries incorporated into her previous analysis. This is unfortunate, especially in the case of an important figurine deposit from the settlement site of Kissonerga near Paphos (discovered in 1987 with final publication by Goring in 1991) which for the first time has provided contextual evidence for a major group of Chalcolithic cruciform figurines. Secondly, the apparent objectivity of the analysis is marred by the fact that the figurines on which the study is based were not examined personally by the author. The formal criteria considered in the MDS analysis have been derived from published drawings, photographs, earlier typologies, and catalogue descriptions. In many cases only a single, frontal view is available in published accounts. Drawings and photo- graphs vary in extent and quality of detail, and rarely do they reveal evidence of wear marks or subtle morphol- ogical or decorative features. Finally, and most seriously, the author fails to fully integrate her results into the matrix of Cypriot prehis- tory. In the final pages of the synthesis (ch. 7), she hints at the social significance of the change during the Bronze Age from generic to specific figurine ('[it] might match a certain complexity in the social organization of early Cypriot society') but immediately abandons this line of thinking by insisting that it lies beyond the scope of the book to speculate about such matters. This contradicts the goals set out in earlier chapters, however, and prevents the book from making a truly significant contribution to our understanding of social complexity, gender roles, and other important issues of the prehis- toric past. As arguably the most important set of social symbols from the pre-state cultures of Cyprus, the cruciform and plank figurines of the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze periods furnish valuable evidence for the emergence of gender hierarchies and social elites during the second half of the third millennium. It is a pity that C., having developed a methodology that stands head- and-shoulders above previous approaches to the subject, has failed to realize the full potential of her analytical results.

The two volumes which make up Ancient Building in Cyprus represent, as with the previous two volumes on Palestine and Syria, an ambitious and far-reaching ideal. Wright has attempted the almost impossible task of pulling together a diverse range of data dealing with the built environment from the Aceramic Neolithic to the Roman Period. His aim is to provide '... a conveniently assembled resume of all the information relating to the subject presently scattered in disparate and often inac- cessible publication'. The aim is admirable, if not overly ambitious. Its very scope, however, is perhaps the greatest drawback and in the absence of specific data or detailed information throughout the text the reader is frequently left questioning the superficiality of the approach and the reliability of many of the premises and assumptions made. 227</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF BOOKS Ancient Building in Cyprus has been published in two volumes with the second being devoted entirely to the illustrations. The text is divided into convenient and logical sections which make access to its various parts quite straightforward. W. tackles the subject in a forth- right manner dealing first with the historical and geo- graphical background before discussing the development of building traditions period by period. No catalogue is provided as this would have become unwieldy and the reader is expected, of necessity, to consult individual site reports for further information. A very useful section on building materials is provided towards the end of the volume although, W.'s publication has, unfortunately, appeared too soon to take account of work currently being carried out at the Lemba Experimental Village into the use of different materials like mud and stone in prehistory as well as into site formation processes (G.D. Thomas, 'The Lemba Experimental Village, Reconstruc- tion and Site Formation Processes', in R. Hachlili, A.Killebrew, G. Lehman (eds.), Interpreting the Past: presenting archaeological sites to the public [Jerusalem, forthcoming]). The style of the work is clear and eminently readable. There are, however, several consistent difficulties with the text which leave the reader with a slight feeling of unease when dealing with areas or period of familiarity and with outright scepticism when approaching the less familiar. Conclusions are frequently drawn with no apparent grounding in fact or observable evidence and interpretations are similarly proposed only to appear later disguised as fact. Outright factual errors do on occasions also occur raising questions about W.'s use of the most recently published archaeological material and his casual attitude to some of the sound archaeological and scientific evidence which has emerged in recent decades. The 'artistic' approach to the large, second volume of illustrations with its many quaint sketches and impres- sions is curious in a work in which precision and clarity of image are crucial. Figs. 10-18, for example, convey very little information and would have been far better presented as photographs. On the subject of buildings, which have such a dramatic visual impact and for which the visual image, be it a measured drawing or a photo- graph, can be used to convey a wealth of information far more efficiently than the written word, this rather archaic approach is a mystery. Maps and plans are frequently schematic or badly reproduced, figs. 20-21 for example, and not a single photograph appears. The caption for the sketches of the traditional houses in fig. 28 specifically mentions the type of masonry used in their construction, a detail which is inadequately expressed in a sketch but which would have been quite clearly demonstrated in a photograph or measured drawing. The same is also true of many of the other views, particularly the older engravings, as in the view of nineteenth-century Famagusta, which is taken from a lovely old and far more detailed engraving and which, if reproduced in its original form, would lend far more weight and authority to W.'s arguments. Despite the obvious shortcomings of some of the original material greater control could have been exer- cised in the presentation and layout of this volume. Even the simple expedient of condensing caption and illustra- tion onto the same page could have made considerable savings. There are, of course, many examples of good illustrations taken from other publications but the opportunity to capitalise on the possibilities of an entire volume of illustrations has, sadly, been lost. The first volume of text is more problematic and more difficult to assess from the point of view of the lay or non-specialist reader. To the scholar or professional archaeologist there are more serious drawbacks. Initially, the use of the footnote system of references and the failure to provide a comprehensive bibliography is irritating although general reference works are given at the end of each section. There are five major sections within the text: geographical background, historical background, history of building, elements of building and foreign connections. By their very nature and scope the first three sections give a reasonable but superficial introduction to the subject. In fact, the geography is so brief as to make it difficult to understand why it is there at all. There is no attempt to assess or even mention the environment and how it may have changed over the past 10,000 years nor how this may have affected or con- strained the development of building traditions on the island. There are, for example, notable differences in regional geology, climate and plant forms which could influence the outcome of a particular architectural type with some areas tending towards a soil based building tradition and others towards stone. Similarly, the historical section is very much a summary and is delivered in a quite didactic manner of unilineal cultural development with little or no attention being paid to other histories such as industrial, agricul- tural, technological or social-all of which would have had a more profound and longer lasting impact upon architectural development than the mere change from one cultural period to another. There are also larger issues and debates within the historical and cultural development of Cyprus than is immediately apparent from W.'s summary. He should, for instance, not be so quick to dismiss the evidence for a Palaeolithic in Cyprus (A. Simmons, 'Preliminary Report on the 1988 Test Excavations at Akrotiri-Aetokremnos', Report of the Department of Antiquities of Cyprus 1989 [Nicosia 1989] 1-6) nor should he settle quite so firmly for a colonial Syro-Palestinian origin for the Cypriot aceramic Neolithic. This ignores the very unique natures of the Neolithic in Cyprus with its links to both Anatolia and the Levant as well as its strong individual local elements. W. divides the development of Cypriot building into four phases: the round house village, rectangular build- ing, urban society and Hellenised Cyprus. Concentrating on the first of these periods it is possible to observe consistent shortcomings which must cast some doubt on much of the interpretive outcome of the work. There is a suspicion that W. has not made full use of all the evidence that was available to him either from published material or from site visits and discussions with exca- vators and archaeologists working in Cyprus. His enthusiasm over the mystical significance of the cross walls at Khirokitia could perhaps be understood if his case was more clearly argued but his insistence on the use of the word 'tholos' for many of the buildings at that site and his contention that many of the larger 228</page><page sequence="3">NOTICES OF BOOKS buildings were tombs, mortuary temples and venues for rituals of birth is highly contentious and ignores the evidence of the domestic material found in them and so clearly described by Le Brun (A. Le Brun, Fouilles Recentes a Khirokitia (Chypre) 1971-1981. Editions Recherches sur les Civilisations, Memoire No 41 [Paris 1984]). Further his dismissal of Le Brun's excellent analysis of the structures and preserved roof debris at Khirokitia (A. Le Brun, Fouilles Recentes a Khirokitia (Chypre) 1983-1986. Editions Recherches sur les Civilisations, Memoire No 81 [Paris 1989]) and his acceptance of Dikaios' earlier tholos interpretation is a mystery and indicates an opinion based not upon observed and carefully recorded data but upon whimsi- cal fancy. Similarly, W. also restates Dikaios' view of the centrally placed plaster platforms found in Late Chalcolithic buildings at Erimi as being the supports for central upright roof posts despite the more recent and published evidence from Lemba which clearly indicates that they were hearths (E.J. Peltenburg, 'Lemba Archae- ological Project vol 1: excavations at Lemba Lakkous 1976-1983', Studies in Mediterranean Archaeology vol. LXX:1 [Goteborg 1985]). His concluding interpretation of the buildings at Lemba with conical mud covered roofs sitting on low stone walls is not only curious but structurally unsound and was certainly not based upon excavated evidence. Caution should also be observed before accepting as fact some of the premises used in the development of discussions within the text. For example, the earliest Chalcolithic buildings come from Area I at Lemba and not from Mylouthkia which has produced no architec- tural remains (E.J. Peltenburg, 'Lemba Archaeological Project, Cyprus 1976-1977: Preliminary Report', Levant 11 [1979] 9-45). Rectilinear architecture is not a Middle Cypriot innovation at all but has potential precursors in the ceramic Neolithic buildings at Sotira (P. Dikaios, Sotira, The University Museum, University of Philadel- phia, 1961) and Philia (V. Karageorghis, 'Chronique des Fouilles et Decouvertes Archeologiques a Chypre en 1968', Bulletin de Correspondance Hellenique 93 [1969] 504-12) as well as very clear examples from the Middle Chalcolithic levels at Kissonerga where circular and rectilinear buildings co-exist (E.J. Peltenburg, 'Lemba Archaeological Project, 1988', Levant 22 [1990] 155- 57). Chambered tombs are now also known to have been a feature prior to the Early Cypriot period and have been found in Late Chalcolithic levels at Kissonerga (E.J. Peltenburg, 'Lemba Archaeological Project, Cyprus 1983: Preliminary Report', Levant 17 [1985] 53-64) and possibly also from the Early Chalcolithic site at Maa (G.D. Thomas, 'The Maa Chalcolithic Excavation' in V. Karageorghis and M. Demas, Excavations at Maa- Palaeokastro 1979-1986 [Nicosia 1989] 267-89). It is odd that such clear evidence was not brought to the fore when, in fact, they are crucial elements in some of the arguments being put forward. These are, admittedly, only a few of the disquieting inconsistencies encoun- tered in an otherwise flowing text. The doubt they raise, however, are serious and have certainly left this reader unsure of much else in the text. On reflection, the subject of ancient building in Cyprus could perhaps have been better handled as a multiple authorship publication in which individual familiarity with specific material could have produced a more comprehensive and profound study. The sheer scale of what has been attempted demands a greater knowledge of the material than is normally within the scope of one person's research background. It has, in this case, encouraged a necessary superficiality and subsequent failure to take due account of available evidence and published findings. Admittedly, it has been possible in the space of a short review to highlight only the earlier periods in Cyprus; to have done otherwise would have been to fall into the same trap, but it is enough to indicate that previous familiarity with the material is essential in order to be able to use the volume wisely. As an introductory guide or as a com- prehensive synthesis Ancient building in Cyprus, unfor- tunately, falls short of the mark. G.D. THOMAS University of Edinburgh YON (M.) Ed.

French archaeological initiative in Cyprus falls into two main periods, divided by the island's achievement of independence. Before 1960 there had been only two French excavations; but, well back into the nineteenth- century, French scholars had often visited Cyprus. Many came from the Ecole Francaise d'Athenes, usually in search of Greek inscriptions, which yielded quick returns. The first French visitors, however, were Orienta- lists, interested in the Phoenicians and intrigued by the mysteries of the Cypriot syllabic scripts. That is why, as A. Caubet explains, the Cypriot antiquities, which flowed so copiously into the Mus6e du Louvre as a consequence of these visits, have always been the responsibility of its Near Eastern rather than of its Classical Department. A tradition of looking at Cyprus from the East certainly bore fruit in 1934, when C.F.A. Schaeffer began digging at Enkomi. Many rich and impressive tombs had already been found there by Classically-trained British and Swedish excavators, who expected Late Bronze Age cemeteries to be extramural; but Schaeffer, coming fresh from Ugarit with its hand- some built tombs within the royal palace, quickly found at Enkomi the as yet undetected town among the tombs. Thanks to the partnership between Schaeffer and the major excavations by the Cyprus Department under P. Dikaios, Enkomi became the most extensively explored (though not necessarily the largest or most important) settlement of the Late Cypriot period. In contrast to Dikaios' definitive and monumental report (1971), publication of the site by French excavators has been slow and piecemeal. V. Karageorghis chides them not only for delay, but also for lack of typological study. No such charge can be levelled against the thoughtful publication of the Iron Age tombs at Paphos-Ktima by J. Deshayes (excavated 1952-55) which, as M. Yon and A. Caubet demonstrate, usefully expanded the SCE typology to define a West Cypriot regional element in the pottery. After the island became independent, Cypriot antiquities no longer flowed into the Louvre, but there 229</page></plain_text>
