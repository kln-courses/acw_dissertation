<plain_text><page sequence="1">MUGHAL AND DECCANI MINIATURE PAINTINGS FROM A PRIVATE COLLECTION 1 BY STUART C. WELCH, JR. SINCE THE PUBLICATION HERE IN I959 OF a number of Mughal and Deccani paintings from two private collections shown at the Fogg Art Museum of Harvard University,2 several miniatures have been added to one of the collections. These include two portraits of the Akbar period (i556-i605), a group of early drawings, another page from a dis- persed Divdn of Shani of about I595, in the highly finished style of the imperial court, as well as a series of pictures dating from the reign of Jahangir (I605-27). A page from the Raznameh of I6 I6, a manuscript associ- ated with the Khan-e Khanan, is of particular interest in relation to the art of Rajasthan. Among the miniatures of the later I7th cen- tury are two from an album of the Shah Jahan epoch (I628-57) and an Awrangzib period (I658-1707) conversation piece in the mixed Mughal-Deccani style patronized by the Mu- ghals who served in the Deccan. There are also several pictures of purely Deccani origin, one of which, although damaged, provides an addition to the small corpus of early Bijapuri portraits. From a later phase comes a pleas- ing Todi Ragini, an illustration to the musical mode, imbued with the characteristics of the style of the court of the last of the Qutb Shahi rulers, Abul Hasan (I672-87), who was known as Tana Shah, "The King of Taste." 1The author would like to express his thanks to Rai Krishnadasa of the Bharat Kala Bhavan, Banaras, Eric Schroeder of the Fogg Art Museum, W. G. Archer of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Martin Dickson of Princeton University, Jean WVat- son of the India Office Library, and to those whose generous assistance has been cited in the catalogue. 2 Vide S.

A stout nobleman leans on his walking stick, his face and body turned to the left as though standing before the enthroned emperor. As usual in portraits of the Akbar period, the figure is set against a green background with no indica- tions of actual space (the traces of grass and flowers are the result of clumsy overpainting of the green, most of which has been removed). He wears a crimson turban decorated with green and white dots, a transparent though pomade-stained muslin jdrneh, the seams of which follow his ample arms and massive torso, and a white pdijdmeh. Three archer's rings hang from a long gold, orange, green, and black flame-stitch patkJ which also sup- ports an orange pouch and a gold katar in an orange sheath. Tassled orange shoes with orange frogs, gold earrings, and a ruby ring complete the costume. The warrior's heavy face is upturned, lending an expression of alertness. Slightly raised eyes, furrowed brow, a sharply bridged nose, and a smiling mouth tinted red with pin enliven the characteriza- tion. The subject of a late copy of a portrait of Raja Rai Singh of Bikaner (I57I-I6I2) in the Bikaner collection closely resembles this Rajput, who might be the same personage.3 The small, closely set feet of the warrior seem barely capable of supporting his looming bulk. This is characteristic of early Mughal portraits, for it was not until the reign of Jahangir that Mughal painters were able to firmly ground their portrait subjects. The costume is also consistent with an early date, as is the treatment of the mouth and chin, 3Fide H.

WELCH, JR. which are in profile despite the three-quarter view of the face, a feature often seen in the Ddstan-e Amir Iamzah manuscript.4 The formula for this sort of portrait was developed during the Akbar period. Ivan Stchoukine has identified a portrait now in the Musee Guimet as contemporary with the Hamzah manuscript, which was probably worked on through the I570'S.5 This minia- ture is identical in style to a group of illus- trated Persian manuscripts several of which contain colophons stating that they were writ- ten at Bakharz in Khorassan during the i s6o's and I57o's.6 A portrait of a Persian in this style, which might have been introduced to India by an artist or artists trained in Kho- rassan, is in the Archaeological Museum, Teheran.7 Although the Guimet and Teheran examples are significant in helping to estab- lish the provenance of this kind of portrait, neither can be considered typically Mughal. Notwithstanding its subject, the Guimet pic- ture portrays a type rather than an individual and lacks altogether the penetrating analysis of form and personality which raises Mughal 4 Vide H.

An attentive boy kneels with his hands on his knees before a bearded teacher, grasping a book, who leans in sympathy toward the stu- dent.8 The boy, whose jameh ties on the left despite his Mughal features, wears a turban wound of a narrow, tapelike length adorned with a black plume and ropes of pearls. A wide, fringed shawl is wrapped over his shoulders and across his arms. The teach- er's fur-trimmed coat is open at the waist, revealing a short kamarband. His turban is large and loosely tied, with ends that flare in splayed flourishes akin to those of his long, graceful scarf, which is draped over his shoul- ders and forearms. The drawing is in black, lightly tinted with flesh tones, streaks of gray in the beard, and brown in the fur collar. It is unusually calligraphic for Mughal work and probably by an artist trained in Persia. Flow- ing curved accents and a system of zigzags meeting in hooklike forms suggest the style of Aqa Riza Jahangiri, a painter who was in India at least as early as I588/9, when his son Abu'l Hasan was born.9 09.1 x 07.5 cm.

In the distance, boldly painted green and blue trees highlighted in white and yellow and cliffs painted in a somewhat Persian manner de- scribe the setting. The ground is treated in a series of receding planes composed of short dashes of color and crosshatching, a technique borrowed from European engraving. Mot- tled greens and tans establish the over-all tone, interrupted by the bright orange, yellow, blue, and crimson of the horseman and his entourage. This page is from a manuscript of the Tritindmeh ("Tales of a Parrot"), a large section of which is in the library of Sir Ches- ter Beatty.

A further miniature from this manuscript is in the collection of Mr. Philip Hofer. For a brief discus- sion of related manuscripts see Welch, S.

Numerous courtiers and attendants look on from the left and the foreground. Green, tan, and blue dominate the palette against which the painter has set small areas of brilliant red and orange, acting as foils to the cool colors of the central fig- ures. Zoomorphic and anthropomorphic shapes abound in the rock forms; an entire rabbit is concealed in the cliff behind the seated man. This sort of "hide and seek" can be found in many Persian and Mughal miniatures, al- though it seems to have been especially char- acteristic of the painter Miskin, to whom this miniature can be attributed.'2 Miskin's highly individual manner is al- ready apparent in the Darab-nameh in the British Museum (Or. 46I5) to which he contributed his earliest surviving work with a contemporary attribution.'3 One of the ar- 12 For a monograph on this artist see W. Staude, Muskine, Revue des Arts Asiatiques, vol. 5, No. 3, I928, pp. I69I-82, pls. 49-52. The author has based his arguments on the pages outlined by Miskin in the Akbar-ndmeh series in the Victoria and Albert Museum (I.S.2-i896). 13 Few miniatures from this important early Mughal manuscript, which although undated cannot be later than 1585, have been published. This page, fol. ioov, depicts a girl captive carried off by horse- men as a man uproots a tree. Other miniatures by Miskin working unassisted are in a copy of Jami's Baharistan in the Bodleian Library (Elliot 254), fol. 42r, dated to the 39th regnal year or 1594/5; the Khamseh of Nizami of the 4oth regnal year, now in the British Museum (Or. MS. I2208), fol. 23v; an Anvdr-e Sohayli in the Bharat Kala Bhavan, Banaras, dated I596, folios 48r, 7ir, Igor; and a Khamseh of Amir Khosrau Dihlavi (W. 624), in the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore, which is dated I597/8. Two pages in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, are probably from the Baltimore Khamseh and should be attributed to this artist. They have been published in color. Fide M.

This painting enables us to isolate a multiplicity of the artist's idiosyncrasies, rang- ing from a particular kind of organic and fre- quently zoomorphic treatment of rocks, to stiff-jointed figures with rounded, pillowlike knees, and jaggedly silhouetted trees, spotted asymmetrically over the page. Like its fellows, this miniature has been attached to an ugly modern mount adorned with a jungle of golden animals. A later version of this miniature is in the Berlin Museum."5 12.6 x o8.7 cm. Ca.

Courtiers, beaters, and other attendants look on in astonishment as the emperor gestures to keep them from interrupting the uneven fight. In the foreground, an encampment of yogis and a family of goats seem oblivious to the drama, separated as they are from it by rocks and trees. A town amidst a craggy land- scape can be seen in the distance. The picture is thinly painted in a palette of tans, pale blues, and greens, highlighted here and there with gold. Although this miniature has been sep- arated from the book or album of which it once was a part, it can be associated with another hunting scene, formerly in the collec- tion of Sir Bernard Eckstein, which bears a perors of India, Delhi, I96I, pl. 7.

It is similar in format to our picture and probably they once illustrated the same book. Stylistically, the Eckstein miniature and the one here are identical. Both can be assigned to Miskin. As we have seen above, Miskin's style is not difficult to recognize once we are familiar with several of his autograph works, although his style evolves with time and certain changes can be noted. For instance, the hidden animal forms of rocks, so frequently discovered in the landscapes of the Baharistan and Shahi miniatures, are not so easily found in later paintings. Basil Gray has dated the Eckstein Lion hunt to i6io on the basis of an episode in the Tuzuk-i-Jahangir! which, however, de- scribes the attack of a tiger, not a lion, and which took place while the emperor was hunt- ing on horseback rather than mounted as here on an elephant.17 The youthful appearance of Jahangir, who is shown prior to his accession, and the picture itself argue for an earlier dat- ing. Stylistically, it should not be much later than the illustrations to the Anvdr-e Sohayli in the Bharat Kala Bhavan, Banaras, which is dated i596.18 23.7 x 12.8 cm. Late i6th century. 16 B.

Black pom-poms hang at her shoulders, wrists, and back. Her jewelry is of gold, rubies, and pearls. The background is apple green.

A conch shell, pouch, knife, begging bowl, and iron flail hang from his belt, and a long horn is sus- pended from a cord around his neck. Rather more elegant than most of his ilk, he wears an archer's ring, bangles, necklaces, earrings, and bracelets.

Dashes and dots made with the tip of the brush sug- gest the rough texture of the skin, which is modeled toward the edges. The mahout wears a pointed jdmeh, a tightly wound turban, and carries a katar. He sits on a coarse mat, per- haps of fur, leaning back to balance the rock- ing motion of his mount. He closely resembles the figures in a portrait identified by Mr. Douglas Barrett as Burhan Nizam Shah, II, of Ahmednagar, a painting to which the draw- ing has further stylistic affinities.21 i8.o x I6.4 cm.

At the lower left, a cheetah mauls a dead buck from which he is about to be lured by a groom, who approaches stealthily, lead in hand. Salim is dressed in dark green and brown, a costume with a certain elegance but primarily intended as camouflage. His attendants are somewhat less soberly attired in subdued tones of blue, tan, and orange. A red sword case, held near the prince, is the brightest note in the color scheme, which is largely tan and green.

It is decorated with minutely drawn angels, saints, and figures running with hounds. A cat licks its paw at the lower right, near a vermilion pillow upon which the girl rests her bangled foot. The drawing is lightly tinted and is reminiscent of the figural bor- ders made for Jahangir's albums.24 The back- ground, however, differs from these in its treatment of space, which recedes in the con- ventional Mughal fashion rather than being composed of weaving two-dimensional pat- terns suitable to marginal decoration.

A scrawny cat and lean dog in the foreground admire an offering of watermelons, a cup, and an odd ewer with a human face. In the distance can be seen a typically Mughal row of trees and flying birds. The drawing is in black ink and very like one attributed to Man6har in the Gulistan Library,26 Teheran. Both drawings seem to derive from engravings of the circle of Mar- cantonio Raimondi.

A damaged in- scription has been deciphered as saying, "A young agha-may be good work by Nanha." 27 This is consistent with the style of the paint- ing, which is that of an Akbari artist striving to adjust to the new manner of the Jahingir period, with its greater tendency toward illu- sionistic detail.

They conform to the fashions that prevailed in the west during the Republican period in Rome, the high renaissance, and the late Victorian era; buxom, matronly types rather than their less substantial if prettier sisters were the vogue.28 The subject of this portrait is obvi- ously made of stern stuff. Her impassive pro- file, set against a black ground, is cast in a 27 I am indebted to Mr. Robert Skelton of the Victoria and Albert Museum for this difficult trans- lation. 28 Vide A. K.

Both of these miniatures are birth scenes of the Jahangir period, probably from a Jahangir-nameh. They can be accepted as reliable portrayals of the imperial zandneh during the early years of the reign. Further evidence of the emperor's taste in women is given in a portrait in whllich he embraces a lady, identified as Niur Jahan by Ivan Stchoukine, Portraits Moghols, 2, Arts Asiatiques, vol. 7, No. 2, Paris, 1932, pp. I67-I76, pl. 56.

Ob- viously a major figure in Jahangir's household, she wears a transparent odhni, a fine muslin choli, and quantities of jewelry: two rings, four strands of huge pearls, two gold neck- laces, a ruby and gold pendant, ruby and pearl earrings, and a similarly shaped hair orna- ment. Although her identification cannot be cer- tain, this forceful woman might be Nuar Jahan, who married the emperor in 6 i6I at the age of 34 and whose career was such as one might expect of the dynamic personality shown in this postage-stamp-size painting. In format, the picture is like several surviving likenesses of the emperor which appear to have been made to be worn as jewels.30 03.O x 02.9 cm. Ca. i6i6. 29 By the time of this painting European en- gravings, tapestries and paintings had long been fa- miliar at the Mughal court. However, it is interest- ing to note that in i6i6 a "small limned picture of a woman" by Isaac Oliver was given by Sir Thomas Roe to the emperor. (W. Foster, The embassy of Sir Thomas Roe, London, I899, vol. I, p. 214, n. i.) This British miniaturist's study of the work of the Italian mannerist, Parmigianino, and his association with emigre artists from Europe is well known (vide Graham Reynolds, Nicholas Hilliard and Isaac Oliver, London, 1947, pp. II-I7, pls. 27-48). It seems quite possible that the manneristic hand of our portrait and even the idea of a small portrait of a woman came about as a result of Sir Thomas Roe's gift. 30 Vide Hollis, Islamic art, selected examples from the loan exhibition of Islamic art at the Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland, 1944, pl. 28. Another is in the British Museum. For a portrait of the emperor wearing such a jewel see I. Stchoukine, La peinture indienne, Paris, I929, pl. 34. Sir Thomas Roe tells of receiving from the emperor "a picture of him selfe sett in gould hanging at a wire gould chaine." (W. Foster, op. cit., vol. i, p. 244.)</page><page sequence="8">228 STUART C.

Babur's memoires include a long discourse on the fauna, as well as the flora, of Hindustan, although no con- temporary drawings or paintings of animals have survived from either his reign or that of his son, Humayuin. During the era of Akbar, animals were frequently painted, but seldom for their own sakes.3' Jahangir's insatiable curiosity about the world-the objects of his interest ranged from walrus teeth to the effect of drink on an imperturbable Sannyasi who had renounced this world, and of course to all forms of wildlife-combined with his love of painting to inspire a remarkable series of animal studies. His autobiography makes fre- quent reference to such commissions from his artists, whose mastery of the genre is demon- strated by a number of pictures which rival Diirer's in accuracy and sensitivity. Our page is made up of several pictures brought together as a sort of collage. Orig- inally, the composition was unified by an over- painted apple-green ground scattered with flowers. Although conceivably of the period, this was applied with little care and its re- moval reveals the acutely observed outlines and the tonal relationships of the subjects to their backgrounds. The contented Tibetan Yak at the bottom of the page may well have been part of Jahan- gir's zoo. He is at pasture against a tan ground, which blends with delicious green grass bordering a stream. Much has been made of the textures; the toughness of horn 31 Exceptions are the animal subjects in such manuscripts as the Bdburnameh and the 'Ajd'ib al- Makhlaqdt, which nevertheless lack the accuracy of observation demanded of Jahangir's painters. The most powerful animal painting of the Akbar period is in the Victoria and Albert Museum's Akbarndmeh (I.S. 2-I896) where the animals outlined by Basa- wan and Miskin are unsurpassed in Indian painting. and hoof, velvety softness of the muzzle, and pliableness of the red leather halter have each been sensed and recorded. His fur is remark- able in its variety, growing in woolly clumps on the flanks, sleek stubble on the nose, and in long white fleece, ready to be clipped and put to use as a chauri. Above, a handsome young stag belies in his stance an apparently mortal bullet wound from which a fine stream of blood trickles onto the terra-verte ground. The knobby roughness of the antlers, lustrous coat, painted hair by hair, following the contours of the lithe body, and subtle transitions of tone, from palest tan to deep brown-black have been put before us with the peculiarly Mughal knack for com- bining painstaking attention to detail with animation. Mounted with the two principle subjects are several smaller studies of nilgai, ibexes, fat-tailed sheep, deer, and goats.

This manuscript, a Khamseh of Amir Khosrau Dihlavi contains an inscription by the Khan-e Khanan (dis- cussed by H. Goetz, Indian miniatures in German museums and private collections, Eastern Art, No. 2, Philadelphia, I930, p. I47), stating that it was pur- chased by him in Gujarat and contains the callig- raphy of Sultan 'Ali and paintings by Bihzad. If the inscription can be believed, the miniatures must have been replaced by those of the owner's atelier, for so knowing a connoisseur could not have been the dupe of his own artist's work. According to Goetz (op. cit.) the miniatures are signed by Qasim, Nadim, and Mishkish. Another manuscript of this group has recently been published by R. Ettinghausen in Paintings of the sultans and emperors of India, pls. 3 and 4 and facing text. It also is inscribed by the Khan-e Khanan, to the effect that it was copied over a period of approximately ten years, apparently while The miniature is inscribed with the artist's name, Fadil, whose work is from one of the other manuscripts of this group.35 His style is individual. Broad and decorative in design, his forms seem to grow naturally around the blocks of the text, each shape leading to the next. He often crowds together near compli- mentary colors of equal intensity, achieving a glowing effect. Pigment is applied in flat patterns, over which he draws an even, rhyth- mic tracery, as in the flowers, tufts of grass, rocks, and in the folds of costumes. Outline is wiry and sure, building a maximum of ten- sion such as we see in the recumbent Sita, whose graceful curves and sharp angles domi- nate the space around her. Gestures and facial expressions are formalized, bringing to mind the stylized postures of the dance drama, by which perhaps they were influenced. And yet, as in the scurrying jackals and boatmen, Fadil was able to freeze the movement he saw and translate it into his own formal terms. Fadil's style, the most distinctive in the atelier of the Khan-e Khanan under discussion (for it seems unlikely that this great patron of the book could have been content with only this rough style and we know that Madhul, a highly skilled painter was also in his employ) is of greater significance in relation to Rajasthani painting than Mughal. While it had no in- fluence whatsoever on later Mughal work, the impact was immediate and direct on Rajas- thani art. Not only does the Laud Ragamala set (Bodleian Library, MS. Laud, Or. I49) owe many of its elements to the style of Fadil, but also we have seen an early Bundi hunting scene thoroughly imbued with his manner. Badaiuni was engaged in making the translation. The style of the second plate published by Dr. Etting- hausen is so like the i6I6 manuscript that one won- ders if the completion of the illustrations did not require an even longer time than the copying of the text. 3 Vide R. Ettinghausen, ibtid.</page><page sequence="10">230 STUART C. WELCH, JR. The diffusion of this style will make one of the more interesting chapters in the history of Rajasthani painting. One wonders where the Khan-e Khanan's painters worked. Did they accompany him to the Deccan or were they located at one of his properties else- where? Jahangir tells of giving him a jagir in the Agra area, a most likely spot for the propagation of this kind of painting, which has such a fervid Rajasthani flavor. 37.0X 22.I cm. Ca. i6i6. i6.

The turban is of conventional Bi- japuri form and again white, with a broad crosspiece of tooled gold decorated with red and green. At the lower left, a patch of pink is all that remains of the padjameh. The portrait brings to mind another, in the British Museum, which is close in style.36 The faces of both pictures are imbued with an almost Egyptian symmetry; the eyes have been transformed into almonds and the other features reduced to equally graceful elements. Nevertheless, the artist's preoccupation with abstract form has in neither case prevented him from achieving incisive portraiture. Once a full-length portrait, this picture has been cut down and torn. o6.6 x 04.I cm. Deccan, School of Bijapur. Ca. I 620. 36 Fide B.

One of the more frequently encoun- tered and easily identified of the imperial albums is that with miniatures set in borders decorated as a rule with large, fully painted figures, animals, and occasionally birds, sur- rounded by small gold flowers painted over the buff paper.37 The marginal figures are sometimes busy at their occupations but more commonly stand somewhat stiffly, obediently facing the picture. Often these attendants were chosen from the immediate circle of the subject of the central portrait. The album varies widely in quality. At best, these portraits maintain the high level established by Akbar and furthered by his son's discerning patronage. Although rather more taut in pose, reticent in expression, and almost vulgarly sumptuous, they remain in the tradition, with no technical falling off. However, they can be among the drabbest of Mughal paintings; superficial facility of craftsmanship fails to conceal an essentially arid and meretricious reworking of a tiring formula. Of the imperial albums that can be reconstructed, this appears to be the latest of its epoch. Not only is it stylistically from the latter part of Shah Jahan's reign, but also .7For reproductions of folios from this album vide Sir Thomas Arnold and J. V. S.

The nimbed em- peror stands on a clump of grass and flowers against a blue-green sky which blends with gold and orange clouds. He wears a pink jameh with narrow gold stripes decorated with red flowers, a matching patka, and a white and orange turban. His paajanmeh is green, worked with gold leaves. Shoes are red, gold, and orange. Contemporary portraits never adorn him with such an array of jewels. His four rings, double-stranded necklace of pearls, emerald pendant, gem-studded katdr, with pearl and ruby fastener, and an even more sumptuous sword would seem better suited to Shah Jahan than to his more Spartan grand- father. The emperor's expression is serious but benign; he gestures with his right hand and appears to be conversing, perhaps with the grandson who commissioned this portrait in his old age.

His turban is red and green; other- wise the costume is entirely gold and white, punctuated by brilliant accents of pearls, emer- alds, rubies, and a veritable garden of red, green, and gold flowers. In keeping with the portrait as a whole, which is an image of the official self, hermetic and quite unlike the psychologically telling likenesses of the Akbar and Jahangir periods, the wrinkles of old age have been hinted at but never delineated. In the lower border, a small goat rests between a pair of lions, perhaps symbolizing the emperor's benevolent but firm rule, under which even the feeble were safe. Overhead, two angels carry a canopy and scroll upon which are written words from the Quran. Three attendants in the right margin stand by with a covered tray, a jewel box, and a fly whiisk.

Thinly painted- the natural tone of the paper predominates- the artist has reserved opaque colors for the white rug, marble dais, cochineal pillows, and almost impressionistically painted still life of flowers, fruit, and wine vessels. The lady who offers her guest a cup of wine bears a striking resemblance to Awrangzib. Conceivably, she is one of his daughters. An album of the Awrangzib period in the Victoria and Albert Museum contains another miniature of a similar subject by the same hand.40 The somewhat Deccani character of these pictures can be explained by the large numbers of Mughals who were stationed in the Deccan during the I7th century. Although ostensibly involved in bitter warfare, the Mughal and Deccani nobles seem to have met more often over the wine cup than with 40 (I.M.132-I885.9). The album is complete al- though dismantled. It contains a conventional por- trait of Awrangzib, one of his father, and several of unidentified nobles of the period. The most elaborate portrait is of Fakhr Khan, a courtier who died in I68i, with his sons. There are also calligraphies, one of them written at Lahore in I656, a number of French engravings, a fragment of a mid-i6th-century Safavid miniature, a series of genre subjects, and an archaistic drawing after a European subject in the style of the Jahangir period. sword in hand. One result of this contact, other than the prolongation of Awrangzib's costly and hopeless campaigns, was the devel- opment of a style of painting in which the lyrical flavor of Deccani art mingles with the more prosaic manner of the Mughals.4 I5.7 X II.8 cm. Ca. I 670. 22. Todi Ragini. (Fig. 22.) This un- usually lyrical version of the musical mode is set in an enchanting world of pink and green pinnacles, feathery trees, growing with no respect for scale, and seemingly transparent birds that flap across a pale sky spattered with blue clouds. Larger than any of the rocks or trees, a girl in orange and red, holding a vina, feeds grass to a buck while two doe stand coyly by. A portrait of Tana Shah of Golconda ("The King of Taste") in the Bikaner col- lection 42 helps to establish the provenance and "The outstanding example of this style is the papier mache box in the Victoria and Albert Museum (I.M. 85I-I889) which has been published by Stella Kramrisch (A survey of painting in the Deccan, Lon- don, I937, pl. XXI) and which can be attributed to Rahim Dakani on the basis of a signed painting in the collection of Sir Chester Beatty (B. Gray, Painting, op. cit., No. 8I9, pl. I47). Another such box has been published by S. I. Tyulayev, Indian art in Soviet collections, Moscow, I955, p1. 22. Deccani-Mughal paintings are not uncommon. The well-known room at Sch6nbrunn is virtually papered with them (vide J. Strzygowski, Die indischen Mini- aturen im Schlosse Sch6nbrunn, Wien, 1923). Others are in an album (Min. 64) in the National Library, Vienna, and a further group is in the Musee Guimet. Of particular interest is a portrait in the Victoria and Albert Museum (I.S. 59.I949) which can be identified as Qilij Khan, a Persian employed by Awrangzib in the Deccan. He is shown with a girl whose costume and facial type are related to our terrace scene. 42 Vide H. Goetz, The art and architecture of Bikaner state, Oxford, I950, fig. go.

This section of a wider painting43 depicts a Mughal prince in a palankin, accompanied by elephants, horsemen, and foot soldiers, which are silhouetted against the pale green back- ground. Banners, palankin, elephant trap- pings, and most of the costumes are dark orange, the elephants gray, and the sky, typ- ically Deccani with its spiral clouds, white, gold, and silver, materials that are used lib- erally throughout. Accents of pale yellow, green, and black among the costumes relieve the monotony of the limited palette. Processions were a favorite subject in the Deccan.4 This one, although Mughal in sub- Bikaner at the fall of Adoni in I689.

Archer dated the portrait to ca. i66o. 43 Another piece, showing the prince's harem in closed palankins is in the collection of Howard Hodgkin, Esq., London. 44 Vide Sir Thomas Arnold and J. V. S. Wilkin- son, op. cit., vol. II, pl. 4, a page from the Nujuim ject, owes much to Golconda prototypes. Such details as the face turned toward the spec- tator, as well as the gaily caparisoned, very fat elephant, and the generally lighthearted atmosphere suggest that the painter had been trained in the Golconda sphere. Further evi- dence is supplied by the less lively but related series of Golconda paintings that illustrate the Storia do Mogor, the memoires of the garrulous Venetian, Niccolao Manucci, who acquired them prior to i686.45 The artist has two claims upon us: he draws with disarming wit and freshness of touch and is particularly adept in recording movement; his palki bearers and foot soldiers are among the few in Indian painting who seem actually to walk. 35.4 x 24.6 cm.
