<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cuteness BY DANIEL HARRIS She stands in maroon bloomers and a pink dress that flares tantalizingly above two acrylic legs that descend, unvaried in diameter, all the way down to her gout-stricken ankles crammed in her booties. Her feet, crippled and pigeon-toed, touch at their tips. A sassy tuft of a synthetic top- knot sprays out of a helmet of auburn hair encircled by a polka-dot bow that sits atop her head like a windmill, dwarfing the rest of her figure. Her nose is no bigger than a button, and her astonishingly candid eyes are two moist pools framed by eyebrows penciled like quizzical circumflexes on the vast dome of her forehead. Emptied of all internal life, these mesmerizing orbs, composing at least 25 % of a face as wide as her shoulders, stare out directly at us with a reticence exaggerated by the hectic flush of her complexion. Her name is "So Shy Sherri," and she is one of toy manufacturer Galoob's nine new "Baby Faces" - a set of "super posin' " dolls with names like "So Sweet Sandi," "So Sorry Sarah," and "So Delightful Dee, Dee," each with an "adorable" expression and personality of her own. Everywhere we turn we see cuteness, from cherubic figures batting their peepers on Charmin toilet paper to teddy bears frozen mid- embrace, the stubs of their pawless arms groping for hugs. Within their natural setting of the consumeristic landscape, such sentimental products of the modern sensibility are so commonplace that they have become the most invasive type of image possible, a form of visual clutter we respond to without really seeing. We tend to think of them not as inventions of the eighteenth or nineteenth century but as something that transcends history altogether and constitutes instead the timeless and universal appearance of purity, instinct, and spontaneity. In the eyes of most people, whose conditioned responses to this most schematic of styles prevent them from</page><page sequence="2">178 DANIEL HARRIS recognizing its glaring artificiality, things like calendars with droopy-eyed puppies pleading for attention or greeting cards with kitty cats in raincoats are the very embodiment of innocence and as such represent an absence of the designed and manipulated qualities characteristic of what is in fact a heavily mannered aesthetic. For them, the foreshortened limbs and the deep wells of the sad, saucer eyes of a doll like So Shy Sherri are part of a unique and readily identifiable iconography whose distortions trigger with Pavlovian predict- ability a nostalgia for a mythical condition of endearing naivete. The chilling paradox of the waxen fetishes over which we croon so irrepress- ibly is that the gross hokum of cuteness suggests the antithesis of what we would expect if we were to judge it on the basis of its extreme stylization alone: guilelessness, simplicity, and the refreshing lack of affectation. Cuteness is not an aesthetic in the ordinary sense of the word at all and must by no means be mistaken for the physically appealing, the attractive. In fact, it is closely linked to the grotesque, the malformed. So Shy Sherri, for instance, is an anatomical disaster. Her legs are painfully swollen, her fingers are useless pink stumps that seem to have been lopped off at the knuckles, and her rosy cheeks are so bloated that her face is actually wider than it is long. Medieval or renaissance images of the Christ child, those obese monstrosities whose Herculean muscularity always strikes the modem viewer as bafflingly inaccurate, make an interesting comparison. For an era like our own that prides itself on its ability to achieve effects of uncanny realism, the disfigured putti of the Baby Face series mark a decline rather than an advance in the representation of children, an eery throwback to the slant-eyed sphinxes of Sienese altar pieces - alien, carnivorous-looking creatures who are, in many ways, as pictorially inexact as So Shy Sherri. Far from being an accident of bad craftsmanship, the element of the grotesque in cuteness is perfectly deliberate and must be viewed as the explicit intention of manufacturers of objects which elicit from us the complex emotions we feel when we encounter the fat faces and the squat, ruddy bodies of Galoob's dolls (or, to give another example, of the Trolls, a series of plastic figurines, extremely popular in the '60s, with pot bellies, pug faces, and teased-up mops of brightly colored hair).</page><page sequence="3">Cuteness 179 The grotesque is cute because the grotesque is pitiable, and pity is the primary emotion of this seductive and manipulative aesthetic which arouses our sympathies by creating anatomical pariahs, like the Cabbage Patch Dolls or even E.T., whose odd proportions and lack of symmetry diverge wildly from the relative balance and uniformity of ordinary bodies. The aesthetic of cuteness creates a class of outcasts and mutations, a ready-made race of loveable inferiors whom both children and adults collect, patronize, and enslave in the protective concubinage of their vast harems of homely dolls and snugglesome misfits. Something becomes cute not necessarily because of a quality it has but a quality it lacks, a certain neediness and inability to stand alone, as if it were an indigent starveling, lonely and rejected because of a hideousness we find more touching than unsightly. The koalas, pandas, dalmatians, and lambs of the stuffed animal series "Lost 'n Founds" directly allude to this state of homeless destitution. With their "adorable * so-sad' eyes" that shed real tears, these shameless examples of the waif or pauper syndrome seem to be begging to be rescued from their defenseless state,so tellingly emphasizedbypawsascumbersome as boxing gloves - absurd appendages that lie uselessly in their laps, totally free of any of the prehensile functions hands usually serve. Because it generates enticing images like these of ugliness and dejection, cuteness has become essential in the marketplace in that advertisers have learned that consumers will "adopt" products that create, often in their packaging alone, an aura of motherlessness, ostracism, and melancholy, the silent desperation of the lost puppy dog clamoring to be befriended - namely, to be bought. Cuteness, in short, is not something we find in our children but something we do to them. Because it aestheticizes un happiness, help- lessness, and deformity, it almost always involves an act of sadism on the part of its creator who makes an unconscious attempt to maim, hobble, and embarrass the thing he seeks to idolize. The process of conveying cuteness to the viewer disempowers its objects, forcing them into ridiculous situations and making them appear more ignorant and vulnerable than they really are (as in William Wegman's hilarious photographs of his dog, the much-put-upon Man Ray, whose beseeching absurdity has made him the</page><page sequence="4">180 DANIEL HARRIS solemn mascot of cuteness at its most high brow). Adorable things are often most adorable in the middle of a pratfall or a blunder: Winnie the Pooh with his snout stuck in the hive; the 101 dalmatians of Disney's classic collapsing in double splits and sprawling across the ice; Love-a-Lot Bear in the movie The Care Bears who stares disconsolately out at us with a paint bucket overturned on his head; or, the grimmest example of the cruelty of cuteness, the real live fainting goat which has acquired of late a perverse chic as a pet (bred with myatonia, a genetic heart defect, it coyly folds up and faints every time you scream at it). Although the gaze we turn on the cute thing seems maternal and solicitous, it is in actuality a transformative gaze that will stop at nothing to appease its hunger for expressing pity and bigheartedness, even at the expense of mutilating the object of its affections. Turning its targets into statues and plush dolls, cuteness is ultimately dehumanizing, paralyzing its victims (who are often depicted asleep) into comatose or semi-conscious things. In fact, the "thingness" of cute things is fixed firmly in our minds by means of the exaggerated textures and hues so characteristic of stuffed animals, with their shimmering satins and their luscious coats of fur, or dolls with their luxuriant profusion of hair, often of absurd length and body (as with the Cutie Kids of the Cutie Club series, a set of dolls whose psychedelic coiffures cascade down their sides in cork-screw curls that hang all of the way to their feet). "Anxiously awaiting power snuggles," FAO Schwarz* s huge grisly bear is a slouching, seemingly invertebrate mammoth rippling with "serious spreads of soft spots" which are "just asking to be hauled and mauled," while their elephant, as large as a St. Bernard, is described as "big, plump, and deliciously soft with soulful brown eyes that encourage big-time hugging and smooching." Vacant and malleable, animals like these inhabit a world of soothing tactile immediacy in which there are no sharp corners or abrasive materials but in which everything has been conveniently soft- sculpturized to yield to our importunate squeezes and hugs. If such soulless insentience is any indication, cuteness is the most scrutable and externalized of aesthetics in that it creates a world of stationary objects and tempting exteriors that deliver themselves up to us, putting themselves at our disposal and allowing themselves to be apprehended entirely through the senses. In light of the intense physicality of our response to their</page><page sequence="5">Cuteness 181 helpless torpor, our compulsive gropings even constitute something one might call cute sex or, in point of fact, given that one of the partners lies there groggy and catatonic, a kind of necrophilia, a neutered coupling consummated in our smothering embrace of a serenely motionless object incapable of reciprocating. Far from being content with the helplessness of our young as we find them in their natural state, we take all kinds of artificial measures to dramatize this vulnerability even further by defacing them, embarrassing them, devitalizing them, depriving them of their selfhood, and converting them, with the help of all of the visual and sartorial tricks at our disposal, into disempowered objects, furry love balls quivering in soft fabrics as they lapse into convulsive withdrawal for their daily fix of TLC. Exaggerating the vast discrepancies of power between the sturdy adult and the enfeebled and susceptible child, the narcissism of cuteness is also very evident in the way that the aesthetic ascribes human attributes to non-human things. Anthropomorphism is to a large extent the rhetorical strategy of children's books which often generate their narratives from a kind of animal transvestism in which dogs, cats, bears, and pigs have the clothing and demeanor of human beings. Calendars, another rich source of cuteness, also employ animal transvestism as a major theme - mice as prima ballerinas in toe shoes and tutus, dogs in party hats and sunglasses, or swallow-tailed hamsters in tuxes and cummerbunds rearing up on their hind legs to give each other what appears to be an affectionate peck on the cheek. Even an artist as respected as William Wegman subtly refashions, in the appropriative style of postmodernism, the low-brow aesthetic of cuteness by decking out his lugubrious mastiff, an irresistibly funereal pooch cheerlessly resigned to his fate, in everything from Christian Dior to Calvin Klein jeans. Examples like these reveal that the cute world- view is one of massive human chauvinism which rewrites the universe according to an iconographie agenda dominated by the pathetic fallacy. Multiplying our image a thousand-fold and reverberating like an echo chamber with the familiar sounds of our own voices, the cute vision of the natural world is a world without nature, one that annihilates "otherness," ruthlessly sup- presses the non-human, and allows nothing, including our own children, to be separate and distinct from us.</page><page sequence="6">182 DANIEL HARRIS The imitative nature of cuteness can also be seen in the aesthetic's relation to precocity. One of the things we find cutest in the behavior of our children is their persistence in mimicking us, not only in such time- honored traditions as dress-up (the anthropomorphic version of which is played out obsessively in children's literature) but in that most basic form of child's play, mothering, whether it be of a doll or of a family pet. The spectacle of toddlers rocking their babies, changing the diapers of the many incontinent toys on the market, placating anxious dolls, or thrashing disobedient teddy bears elicits some of our most gloating and unrestrained responses to cuteness. Nothing delights us more than the strange sight of a one-year-old in a stroller meeting a barely ambulatory two-year- old, who, rather than seeking to establish a kind of spontaneous esprit de corps with his peer, breaks rank and jibbers baby talk at the bewildered object of his curiously perfunctory affections. As co-conspirators in this game of make-believe maturity, we reward children who at once feign helplessness and assume adult authority in mothering others, reinforcing simultaneously both infantilism and precocity. The child is thus taught not only to be cute in himself but to recognize and enjoy cuteness, to play the dual roles of actor and audience, cootchy-cooing as much as he is cootchy-cooed. In this way, our culture actively inculcates the aesthetic doctrines of cuteness by giving our children what amounts to a thorough education in the subject involving extensive and rigorous training in role-playing. By encouraging them to imitate the way we ourselves fawn over their own preciousness, we give them the opportunity to know cuteness from both sides of the equation, not only from the standpoint of the object receiving the attention but from the standpoint of those giving it as well, from their appreciative audience- cum-artistic directors whom they impersonate for brief and touching intervals in their own highly informative charades of child-rearing. We teach our children the nature and value of cuteness almost from the dawn of consciousness and initiate them into the esoteric rituals of its art, passing on to them the tribal legacy of its iconographie traditions, its strange, self- mutilating ceremonies, as alien in their way, at least to a culture unindoctrinated in cuteness, as many of the scarification customs of Africa or New Guinea. Because imitation allows children to observe their own behavior with the analytic detachment with which they in turn are</page><page sequence="7">Cuteness 183 observed by their admirers, cuteness is unique among aesthetics because it lays the foundations for its own survival by building into itself a form of proselytizing. The association of cuteness with a delusional state of artlessness prevents us from realizing that the qualities of primitivism and droll savagery around which we have woven this all-consuming folk religion are not naturally-occurring elements of the universe but cheap alloys that embody something we would like to see in children rather than something we actually do see there. Its conventions are the residue of unfulfilled wishes that crystallize from the heated interaction of the daily realities of children with our quixotic and unobtainable notions of what they should ideally be like. Cuteness is every parent' s portable utopia, the rose-colored lenses that color and blur the profound drudgery of child-rearing with soft- focussed sentimentality. We use it to allay fears of our failures as parents and to numb us to the irritations of the vigilance we must maintain over creatures who are, in many instances, despite the anesthetizing ideology of cuteness, more in control of us than we are of them. Although it is easy to sympathize with the disquieting frustrations that underlie this aesthetic, cuteness is in fact ultimately more a source of unhappiness among parents than comfort. To superimpose the vast edifice of fetishized images and intricate rituals onto the shallow foundations of a reality that cannot withstand its weight is to invite disappointment not only for us but for our children as well. Cuteness saturates the visual landscape of consumerism with images that cause feelings of inadequacy among parents, who inevitably measure the rowdy and selfish behavior of their own children by the exacting ideals of tractability, cuddliness, and quiescence promoted by an aesthetic at loggerheads with reality. Just as the inundation of our culture with the glitzy images of recent video pornography has elevated our aesthetic standards in regard to our partners (and consequently interfered with our sexual enjoyment of ordinary bodies in all of their imperfections), so cuteness elevates our expectations in regard to our children. It prevents us from enjoying them in their natural, unindoctrinated state, oppressed as we are by our apparent failures as care givers who strive unavailingly to discern in our head-strong offspring the lineaments of the model child, that ghoulish incubus summoned forth by an aesthetic that causes so much soul-searching and self-recrimination.</page><page sequence="8">184 DANIEL HARRIS The result of this psychological malaise is an entirely new aesthetic, an invention of the last few decades: the anti-cute. In an effort to counteract the lethal toxicity of the images of children we are constantly ingesting, a culture like our own naturally produces as an antidote images of the exact opposite of cuteness: the perverse. Our belief that our children are harmless little cherubs collides with their intransigence and generates in the process so much hostility that we are inclined to view them as corrupt, possessed, even satanic. Cuteness thus coexists in a dynamic relation with the perverse. The failure of the hyperboles of one aesthetic gives rise to the hyperboles of the other, of the child as the vehicle of diabolical powers from the Great Beyond which have appropriated the tiny, disobedient bodies of our elfish changelings as instruments for their assaults on the stability of family life. The spate of films about demonic possession shows just how assiduous we have become about building up the new iconography of the anti-cute. Catering to a deep need in the popular imagination, Hollywood has begun to manufacture images that function as outrageous travesties of cuteness, like those found in Poltergewi, in which a young girl becomes the conduit of tormented spirits of the damned who emerge from the throbbing blue light of the television set; or in Child's Play, in which the spirit of a dead serial killer inhabits the body of a doll named Chuckie, who, stalking down hallways with butcher knives tucked behind its back, murders Aunt Maggie, the baby sitter, by giving her such a jolt that she staggers backwards out of the kitchen window and plummets ten floors to splatter on the hood of a parked car. Similarly, in David Kronenberg's The Brood, the dwarfish gnomes of the protagonist's children géstate in moldy embryonic sacks hanging outside of her belly where they begin spontane- ously to respond to her volatile moods, ultimately bludgeoning her mother to death with kitchen utensils in a fit of rage. Although it is still the dominant mode of representing children, cuteness is an aesthetic under siege, the object of contempt, laughter, and skepticism. Its commercialized aura of greeting-card naivete makes it so fragile, so vulnerable to ridicule, that it cannot withstand the frank realism with which matters of parenting, divorce, and sexuality are now, for the first time, being addressed by the public at large. In the last few decades, cuteness has been subjected to remorseless satire as we attempt to loosen</page><page sequence="9">Cuteness 185 the grip of its iconography on an imagination hungry for images closer to the harsh realities of the era of the latch-key kid, the two-career family, the single-parent household, the crack baby, and the less-than-innocent, drug- running sixth-grader with a beeper in one pocket and a .44 Magnum automatic pistol in the other. Loud and chaotic, "The Simpsons" is the new anti-cute show of the '90s, the "all- American dysfunctional family" as they have been nicknamed. Their household constitutes a direct subver- sion of the insipidity of cuteness, with its cartoon characters' harshly contoured shapes, gaping mouths, and enormous boiled-egg eyes goggling in such a way as to suggest the mindless somnambulism of compulsive T. V. viewers. The anti-cute launches a frontal assault on fuzzy- wuzziness with a blitz of images of the child as the monster, the petulant and demanding brat who disdains all of the sacrosanct laws of property ownership, gleefully annihilating cuisinarts and microwaves as he mows a broad swathe of destruction through the very heart of the household's inner sanctum. With the rise of the anti-cute, we are witnessing what amounts to civil war in the contemporary aesthetic of the family, a battle in which the image of the child as the unnatural spawn of Satan, an impish spirit of pure malevolent mischievousness, has locked horns with that of another sort of creature altogether. Generating their plots by pitting the cute against the anti-cute, Parts 1 and 2 of Gremlins provide a kind of allegory of this transformation. In Part 2, the adorable "Gizmo" (an appropriate name for this standard-bearer of cuteness since it emphasizes the animal's status as an inert object) purrs with a contented coo, its droopy ears and sad eyes inviting the lubricious embraces of cute sex. After it is exposed to water, however, it begins to reproduce, laying eggs that enter a larval stage in repulsive cocoons covered in viscous membranes. Whereas Gizmo is soft, dry, and relatively well-behaved, the ferocious aliens that quickly hatch from their water-induced hibernation in these protoplasmic pods are, as one character calls them, "ugly, slimy, mean-spirited, and gloppy." In them, both the behavior and appearance of cute objects are at once evoked and subverted. Gizmo's strokeable fur is transformed into a wet, scaly integu- ment, while the vacant portholes of its eyes (the most important facial feature of the cute thing, giving us free access to its soul and ensuring its</page><page sequence="10">186 DANIEL HARRIS total scrutability, its incapacity to hold back anything in reserve) become diabolical slits hiding a lurking intelligence, just as its dainty paws metamorphose into talons and its pretty puckered lips into enormous Cheshire grimaces with full sets of sharp incisors. Whereas cute things have clean, sensuous surfaces that remain intact and unpenetrated (sug- gesting, in fact, that there is nothing at all inside, that what you see is what you get), the anti-cute Gremlins are constantly being squished and dis- emboweled, their entrails spilling out into the open, as they explode in microwaves and are run through paper shredders and blenders. With the help of food and water, they multiply exponentially and begin their devastating campaign - Hollywood's favorite plot device - against property ownership, destroying in Part 1 an entire town and, in Part 2, a skyscraper modelled on the Trump Tower. In this Manichean contrast between the precious Gizmo and its progeny, the hyperactive vandals who incarnate a new but equally stylized representation of youth and innocence, Gremlins neatly encapsulates the iconographie challenges to an aesthetic that is gradually relinquishing its hegemony over the popular imagination as the vapid artificialities of its conventions are burlesqued in our culture's recent attempts to purge itself of its antiquated religion of infantilism.</page></plain_text>
