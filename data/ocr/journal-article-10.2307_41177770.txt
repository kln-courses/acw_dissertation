<plain_text><page sequence="1">REDUCTIONISM IN THE STUDY OF RELIGIONS JOHN Y. FENTON The Public-Secular Context study of religions has become an accepted part of liberal arts and humanities programs at many public, secular uni- versities in the last ten years and it is quite probable that the bulk of future scholarly study of religions in the United States will be transferred to the public-secular context. This radical change in institutional basis and supporting community will and ought to precipitate changes in the conceptions of how religions should be studied, what questions should be asked about them, and what subject-matter is included in this field. Sweeping changes have already begun to occur, for example, in the development of programs in non-western religions designed to describe these religions for their own sake rather than as an adjunct of mission- ary or theological considerations. But religious studies programs in the secular universities tend in many cases to transfer tech- niques, theories, and subject-matter organization, as well as per- sonnel, from the private-ecclesiastical situation to the public- secular situation with only minor reconception. Some aspects of the discipline of religion as it was previously known may no longer be appropriate in the new context. Even a self-conscious effort to achieve a secular approach to the subject may retain Mr. Fenton, who teaches religion at Emory University in Atlanta, co- edited Religion in the Public Domain and claims as his primary scholarly in- terest the comparative epistemology of religions. 61</page><page sequence="2">62 SOUNDINGS hidden theologisms.# In this paper I wish to draw attention to one of these central conceptions that appears not only to serve primarily theological rather than scholarly interests, but also tends to deter the development of religious studies programs into rich and varied interdisciplinary concerns. The conception of religion as sui generis, i.e., as a primary datum which can be understood only in its own terms, has gener- ally been accompanied in theological circles by its natural corrol- lary: reductionistic explanations of religion are entirely incorrect. In the private-ecclesiastical context this conception was one item in the theologians' defense of the faith against anti-religious attacks. In the public-secular context this conception is quite possibly misleading, especially when it forms part of the rationale for the formation of departments of religious studies. The sui generis conception of religion has quite often been employed in the defense of the autonomy of the subject matter of religious studies and of the disciplines solely appropriate to its study. The result is that the secular study of religions has not so far been notable for a broader conception of its subject-matter, nor for the absence of defensive, apologetic overtones to its investigations. What the secular study of religions includes under its purview, the methods of investigation which it should utilize, and the type of personnel it will employ should no longer be restricted by the need to defend the faith, or to defend its theologistic residue, the anti-reductionistic sui generis character of the so- called "discipline of religion." Reduction as a Research Device "Reductionistic" has functioned as a "boo-word" in theological circles.* If it could be shown that a theory of the nature and # By "theologism" I mean a concept properly and primarily developed and used in a theological context that has been transferred with some residue as a non-theological concept to another domain such as that of the secular scholarly study of religions. "Theologistic," the adjectival form, refers to scholarly thinking that employs concepts of this sort without being aware of the hidden theological residue. * "Reductionism" has had a special meaning in the private-ecclesiastical context quite different from the meaning of the term in logic and the philos- ophy of science.</page><page sequence="3">REDUCTIONISM IN THE STUDY OF RELIGIONS 63 function of religion explained religion only by reducing it to other more manageable or familiar categories, the theory would normal- ly be rejected precisely because it could be so labeled. Rejection has no doubt been justified when it comes to a host of simplicistic theories that claim that religion "is only" something besides religion, e.g., wish-projection, compensation for fear, a construct of ancient priests or political leaders, etc. Often those who have proposed such theories have been openly anti-religious and this fact has helped to obscure the more important difficulty with reductionism, which is that it provides a simple answer for a complex question, an answer too simple in fact to account for all that goes on in religions. But is this as such really a difficulty? Is the fact that an explanation of a phenomenon is simpler than the phenomenon itself sufficient reason to reject the explanation? It seems obvious that simplicity alone is not sufficient reason. In fact, it is questionable whether there is any form of explanation of religions that would not be reductionistic, i. e., explaining only certain aspects of religions and in much more simple terms than what the explanation is meant to interpret. "Reduction" can mean and often enough has meant something much more careful, much more restricted than the claim that a given explanation totally accounts for its subject. This is true even among persons well known as "anti-religious" scholars. For example, the logical positivist Rudolf Carnap1 was explicitly re- ductive in his attempt to evolve a unified vocabulary for all the natural sciences. His definition of "reduction" was too technically expressed to be quoted here, but it is clear that he understood reduction to be an attempt to translate the data and theories of one field of study into those of another insofar as this is possible and practicable. In particular Carnap was trying to translate data from the biological sciences into terminology appropriate to physics in order to facilitate the study of the physics of biology, a field now known as bio-physics. In the sense in which Carnap used the term "reduction," every systematic attempt to under- stand phenomena reduces the phenomena. Systematic interpreta- tion necessarily translates the phenomena into disciplinary terms, simplifies, and narrows the perspective. This is as true in the study of religions as in the study of anything else. How do we evaluate a theory? I would suggest that we ask whether the theory organizes and illuminates the data appro-</page><page sequence="4">64 SOUNDINGS priately, whether the theory is suggestive of wider application, and whether the theory is inclusive of all the data that it ought to explain. If a given theory satisfies the first two criteria but has a relatively narrow scope of explanatory power, then we look for a theory with a wider scope that is still applicable to the context we wish to explain. If in a given field of study we cannot find a theory general enough to explain all of the relevant data we have no alternative but to proceed piecemeal. We employ a variety of theories with limited explanatory scope even if a satisfactory overarching theory of the relationship among the partial theories is lacking. The absence of a general explanatory theory of all the important aspects of religions characterizes the current situation in the history of religions. Equally characteristic, but largely ignored, is the existence of a variety of fruitful explanatory theories of limited scope of application, each of which is capable of contributing to the over-all understanding of the complexity of religious history. There is, I suggest, nothing wrong with reductionism in the study of religions, unless the investigator does not self-consciously realize that he is reductionistic, unless the reductionistic scholar thinks that his discipline alone allows him to isolate the essence of religious phenomena from their accidents, unless he over- extends his method beyond its legitimate scope. But overestimat- ing the explanatory powers of one's scholarly methods is difficult to avoid. It is quite natural that a scholar would value the meth- ods he has laboriously acquired and would tend to extend them to any phenomena he wants to study. It is quite natural, and sometimes even illuminating, for the psychoanalyst to try to understand religious behavior as a problem in individual psychol- ogy, for the logician to understand religious thought as a problem in validity, or the physical educator to interpret meditative postures as a problem in physical conditioning. Reductive Studies of Religions Theoretically it might be expected that the contributions of the social sciences to the secular study of religious would need no argumentation. In fact, their contributions have been regarded at best as not directly integral to the study of religions; at worst, their assumptions and findings have been received variously with</page><page sequence="5">REDUCTIONISM IN THE STUDY OF RELIGIONS 65 misapprehension, distrust, defensiveness, and counter-attack. The residue from the private setting has carried over in its basic struc- ture to the public-secular study of religions in religious studies departments. Because sociology of religion, for example, regards religious groups as social groups fulfilling social functions; be- cause psychology, anthropology, and sociology together consider the function of religions to be the fulfillment of social, psy- chological, biological, and cultural needs; and because religious beliefs are often described as projected satisfactions of these needs, or as illusions, the secular scholar in religious studies, like his sectarian predecessor, tends to regard the social sciences as peripheral to the study of religions. Since the time of Durk- heim, Malinowski, and Freud sociology, anthropology, and psy- chology have too often been regarded as disciplines that either explain religions away or by their nature make assumptions which prevent scholars in these fields from coming to grips with what religions are really about. As Paul Pruyser2 has indicated, the sub- jectivistic, emotional character of religious experience as con- ceived in the William James tradition of psychology of religion made it unnecessary for the theological disciplines to take psy- chology of religion seriously. Since cognitive states, decisions, and acts were thought to be more central to the nature of religions, psychology of religion could be ignored. Despite their obviously reductive character the methods of the social sciences undoubtedly provide insight into important, per- haps even constitutive aspects of religions in contemporary civil- ized society as well as in primitive society. It is undeniable that religions have in some important measure functioned, for ex- ample, as a projection of the ethos of social groups. This is ev- idenced, for example, in the continued viability of Durkheim's theory,3 which has shaped the central thesis of Will Herberg's Protestant, Catholic, Jew4 and J. Milton Yinger's5 explanation of the Black Muslim Movement as a necessary religious projection of Black American group self-consciousness. More generally, it is obvious that religious groups are social groups. The sociologist sees the religious group as just another group subject to the same methods and subsumed under the same generalizations as other social groups. While this approach no doubt restricts the sociol- ogist's vision, it is nevertheless precisely because he so restricts himself that he can provide us with an understanding of religions</page><page sequence="6">66 SOUNDINGS as social phenomenon that we could not otherwise obtain. That the understanding of the social aspect is necessary to our general understanding of religions is obvious. In fact a religious studies program that does not integrate this facet of religions is im- poverished. The same is true of theories which explain religions in terms of need-satisfaction. To reject such theories on theologistic grounds because they are reductionistic would be to miss the point. Religions do fulfill needs of many kinds and they perform a wide variety of functions. Furthermore, the functions of re- ligions vary according to time and place and from one stratum of the society to another. The attempt to delineate and to in- terpret these satisfactions and functions and to discover their dis- tribution and degree is fundamental to the description of the entire spectrum of a religious tradition. For the secular study of religions the question is not whether or not these methods are reductionistic and therefore incorrect or irrelevant. The questions are rather: (1) Since these methods are reductionistic, what is the proper scope of their application? How much do they explain? What do they leave out? (2) Since these methods are reductionistic, how do they relate to other re- ductionistic attempts to interpret religions? How may these ap- proaches be integrated into a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental nature of religions? The social sciences do not explain religions completely, but they do not even try to do so, insofar as scholars in this area are methodologically sophisticated enough to realize the limitations they impose on their investigations by the very methods they adopt. The problem of evaluation is thus partly a matter of the scope of their explanatory power. But, as a number of social scientists are beginning to be aware, the problem is also one of their integration into the holistic study of religions. As M. E. Spiro6 has argued, merely to point out that religion has a social integrative function leaves us in the dark about religion. Re- ligion explains society, not the other way around. Until religion is explained the social integrative power of religion is left un- explained. Neither social structure nor religion is an epiphenom- enon of the other. Each has an impact on and relationship with the other. Furthermore, as E. H. Winter7 and R. E. Bradburys have shown, the importance of religion in the formation of social</page><page sequence="7">REDUCTIONISM IN THE STUDY OF RELIGIONS 67 group structures varies considerably even from one primitive culture to the next. In some societies one cannot describe the social structure except in terms of religious beliefe and practices. In others, such as that described in A. R. Beals' study of Gopal- pur,9 the role of religion is minimal and could be left out of the description. Spatial contiguity, utilitarianism, economic transac- tions, and kinship ties are in these cases far more effectively in- tegrative socially than are religious beliefs. Discovering the proper scope of a theory of religions is thus dependent upon the way in which the theory fits into a theory of religions as a whole.* Incorporation of the insights and data of the social sciences into the secular study of religions will not be accomplished merely by overcoming our anti-reductionistic bias in the sense of making use of the contributions of these disciplines for the study of re- ligions as these disciplines now stand. Before their proper scope can be determined the secular study of religions must incorporate these disciplines integratively into the holistic study of religions. This enterprise would force reconception not only of the psy- chology or sociology of religion for their use in the secular study of religions, but also would force reconception of the discipline of religious studies. The Study of Religions as Religious The approaches to religions utilized by scholars in religious studies are commonly assumed to be non-reductionistic. Religious studies restricts its attention primarily to the "religious" character of religions, to their unique intentionality or sui generis nature. Since the "religious" character of religions is generally understood to deal with the same kinds of things with which theology is concerned (e.g., faith, salvation, the transcendent, world views, value, truth, and beauty structures) , the methods employed to study the "religious" tend either to be exclusively humanistic or * A number of questions are here raised of considerable importance for both the social scientific and the religious studies approaches to the religions. Are religions socially integrative in all cultures? Are religions necessarily im- portant in all cultures? It thus becomes a debatable matter whether all cul- tural ideology until recent times was religious, and it prompts inquiry whether the idea of "religion as the substance of culture" may not be a misleading theologism.</page><page sequence="8">68 SOUNDINGS to treat non-humanistic methods as peripheral approaches more appropriate to other departments or disciplines. The background of this rather exclusive conception of the study of religions is partly historical, but it is also due in large measure to lack of major methodological reconception to fit the public-secular con- text. Methodological discussions in the field have instead been primarily concerned with the possibility of studying religions without theological bias (objectively and descriptively or his- torically) ; with the need to establish religious studies depart- ments because the subject matter cannot be adequately handled by any other department; and with a variety of methodological problems involved in the "religious" study of religions. But the belief that the proper study of religions concerns primarily the "religious" nature of religions has remained largely unchallenged. The contrast between the social scientific and the "religious" conceptions of the study of religions may be highlighted with reference to two theories currently very influential in the field, those of Mircea Eliade and W. C. Smith. In contrast to anthro- pomorphic theories that interpret religions as a projection of human needs, values, images, and experiences, Mircea Eliade,10 for example, treats the sacred symbols of a religious tradition as primary data, explaining human needs, values, and experiences as functions of the symbols. Instead of the Sacred's being con- ceived in the image of man, Eliade emphasizes that man under- stands himself as an image of the Sacred. To label this difference we will coin the term "hieromorphic" (hieros plus morphe) .X1 Religious scholars generally regard hieromorphic interpreta- tions of religions as the most appropriate approach because they describe religions in their specifically religious character, in their unique intentionality. To be sure, to the extent that religions do have a sui generis character, no explanation could possibly be complete that leaves this factor out. In many cases the hieromor- phic character of a religious tradition at a particular time and place may be its most important feature. But hieromorphic inter- pretations of religions are no less reductionistic than anthro- pomorphic interpretations, for they oversimplify the complex phenomena of religious history. A complete account of the history of religious configurations cannot possibly be given merely as a function of their "religious" character. Hieromorphic interpreta- tions are important, for they clarify aspects of religious com-</page><page sequence="9">REDUCTIONISM IN THE STUDY OF RELIGIONS 69 plexity for which anthropomorphic interpretations cannot ad- equately account. But religions are also clearly anthropomorphic. If the social scientific accounts of religions are properly subject to the criticism that they examine only the non-religious reasons for being religious (anthropomorphic reduction) , the "religious" approach is properly criticized as examining only the religious reasons for being religious (hieromorphic reduction) . Clearly the fact is that there are many reasons why persons are religious. Some of these reasons are more or less secular (economic, social, his- torical, geographic, political, psychological, etc.) while others can be identified in specific traditions at particular times as more or less Sacred configurations (revelational, experiential-apprehen- sional, traditional, symbolic, dogmatic, actional, communal, etc.) . The structure of a religious tradition is never merely hieromor- phic. Hieromorphic theories are not capable of more than partial interpretation of religious history and they fail to integrate the unique character of religions in a way organic to the whole cultural context. The study of religions in departments of reli- gious studies will not be truly secular until it ceases to confine its attention to the specifically religious character of religions. The mere addition of social scientific methods to the study of religions will not suffice to achieve the secular study of religions. Recognition of the reductionistic character of merely hieromor- phic interpretations makes reorganization of the whole approach to religions necessary. The popular theory of W. C. Smith,12 for example, makes ample room for the methods and questions which the secular scholar wants to raise and the information he can pro- vide about religions. But simultaneously the secular scholar's findings are considered relevant to understanding religions only to the extent that they enable us to infer the nature of the per- sonal faith which lies behind the cumulative tradition of the re- ligion. Faith is the primary nonobservable of which the cumula- tive tradition is only a secondary expression. The scholar employs reductionistic methods to study the tradition (observable) in order to find out what the faith (unobservable) is by inference. In the final analysis religions are reduced to piety, to personal transcendent faith. Smith's conception of the study of religions is an attempted compromise between the concerns of the scholar and those of the theologian or man of faith. It is to be hoped that Smith's eloquent and convincing argu-</page><page sequence="10">70 SOUNDINGS ment that a variety of admittedly reductionistic methods should be combined for a more adequate interpretation of what it means to be religious will help to hasten needed changes in the con- stitution of religious studies departments. Further, it is clear that religions are frequently to be understood, at least in part, in terms of men's discovery of or being discovered by what they apprehend as transcendent. An adequate secular approach to the study of religions must be open to their possible religious meaning. But even so, it is not only reductive, but restrictively so, to mean by religion only what its adherents can see, but which non-adherents cannot see. The participant, the believer is not necessarily his own best interpreter. Autobiography is not necessarily more re- liable than biography. Furthermore, it seems clear that the re- ligious life is not lived merely in a transcendent context, nor is the transcendent the only significant thing about it. Possibly the transcendent is not even the most significant thing about reli- gions.13 The religious tradition expresses many things besides piety, and religions function in many ways besides being a vehicle of transcendence. The secular study of religions must become free enough of theologistic bias to focus upon all the important aspects and functions of religions in culture, and it must do this without assuming prior to investigation that the key function or essence of religions and its relative importance is already known from theological sources. What has already been said of hieromorphic reduction in gen- eral is obviously also true of theological and revelational theories of religions. In these cases also the essence or primary datum is declared to be one particular aspect or function of religions. But the believer is his own expert only in certain limited respects. If an essence of religion is found by a theological method, it is merely (but also at least) a theological essence. Even here, as Eugene Fairweather14 has argued, theological "essences" of reli- gions tend, like their secular analogues, to correlate the "revela- tional" with some favorite form, or institution of human experi- ence. Sectarian bias is only part of the problem of theological accounts of religions. These accounts tend to be skewed as well as partial. An inordinate importance is generally given (especially in Protestant circles) to theology and religious thought, and criteria derived from normative theology are quite often em- ployed to organize data in ways which are quite misleading for</page><page sequence="11">REDUCTIONISM IN THE STUDY OF RELIGIONS 71 the secular study of religions. The opposition of "faith" to "re- ligion" or "revelation" to "superstition", and even the conception of the hieromorphic as something by nature opposed to the an- thropomorphic, mirror this kind of theologically introduced dichotomy. The usual distinction between magic and religion is largely theologistic also. While it may be theologically interesting to%say that religion is non-coercive while magic is coercive, the statement is at best only partly true and in general quite mislead- ing and artificial.* Theology may possibly be unique to religions,15 but it is cer- tainly not wholly constitutive of religions. In fact theology cannot be adequately interpreted without assessing its role in the cul- tural context in which it functions. M. E. Spiro16 has put forth the rather surprising argument that belief in superhuman beings is a universal characteristic of religions. That this generalization could be plausible even in the case of the "well known" atheism of Theravada Buddhism is based, not upon an ingenious inter- pretation of Theravada scriptures and philosophy, but rather up- on an analysis of the way in which Theravada belief systems func- tion in every traditional society in which it has been extant. Thus it is not clear that theological approaches to one's own sectarian tradition can really meet even sectarian needs for adequate under- standing.* Sectarian religion needs the secular study of religions. The Secular Study of Religions: Some Concluding Theses A There is no one discipline presently extant in the university that "owns" the subject matter of religions either by virtue of the exclusive appropriateness of its method of approach or because of its comprehensive coverage. Religious studies departments as * Magic is sometimes distinguished from religion on other (but no more convincing) grounds, as in B. Malinowski's Magic, Science and Religion and Other Essays (Garden City, 1948), esp. pp. 38-87. Religion is said to differ from magic in its not being directed toward a definite practical end as in magic, in its being common to the whole group, and in its complexity. * That the so-called "Zoo" approach to the composition of religious studies departments (in which the department is composed of representatives of the different religious traditions) is pluralistic in conception rather than secular should be obvious.</page><page sequence="12">72 SOUNDINGS presently constituted in secular universities do make religions their primary concern and thereby have some sort of prior claim to the subject. But the concern of religious studies departments with religions is exceedingly narrow. If William James17 was right when he concluded that religious experience has no single motiva- tion or drive, that its sources are complex, then there is reason tó suggest that the same is true about the whole phenomenon called religions. Religions are complex. They perform many im- portant functions in the culture as a whole and they derive from many different sources. We cannot interpret religions adequately in the secular context if we confine our interest to those aspects of religions that appear, from an ultimately theologistic point of view, to be religious or faithful. At present the study of religions is highly fragmented into a variety of largely unrelated depart- ments and disciplines. No one discipline takes this variety and complexity sufficiently into account. A variety of disciplines must be combined to provide more adequate coverage and new general theories of religions must be developed to integrate the inter- disciplinary study of religions into a comprehensive account. B The comprehensive study of religions demands integrated, interdisciplinary study. It is often assumed that aspects of religions not treated in religious studies departments will be treated in other departments of the university. The extent to which this is true varies considerably.* In any case, the ways in which the "non-religious" aspects of religions are studied quite often do not contribute in any direct manner to the overall comprehension of religions. This failure is sometimes due to lack of interest, but more often it results from the disciplinary focus given to the study of religions in each department. The sociologist of religion studies religions, to be sure, but he does so as a sociologist who contrib- utes primarily to the advancement of sociological knowledge rather than to the comprehensive understanding of religions. A * Study of religions is currently popular in sociology and anthropology departments, less popular in philosophy departments, and often quite in- commensurate with the research interests of psychology departments. The economics of religion is practically non-existent, except as a form of an- thropological method.</page><page sequence="13">REDUÇTIONISM IN THE STUDY OF RELIGIONS 73 sociology of religion is needed that would focus primarily on the study of religions. At the same time religious studies also needs to be reconceived, not merely so that it can include wider con- cerns and newer kinds of information than formerly, but also to adjust, to reorder, and to reevaluate the importance and place of its own contributions to the understanding of religions. It is gen- erally recognized that theology is no longer the queen of the sciences. It is high time that we realized that it is not even queen of the science of religions. The secular study of religions I am proposing would not have a distinctive methodology peculiar to itself. The unity of the field would be found in its attempt to unify and integrate the results of all the methods which aid in comprehending its subject mat- ter.* The subject is the religions. Phenomena would be studied because they belong to and illuminate religions. There is no need to claim that religions are sui generis in any strong sense. The religions as a subject matter do have a practicable recog- nizability and this subject matter needs to be studied in its own right as a unified and comprehensive undertaking. C The idea of the secular study of religions calls the basic nature of religious studies into question. Religious studies should per- haps not remain a humanistic discipline; certainly it should not remain exclusively humanistic in orientation. It should expand to include every method that throws important light upon the cen- tral subject: the religions. In addition to methods already dis- cussed, the economics of religions should be included. The study of economics and religions has occasionally been of substantial importance (e.g., the Weber-Tawney thesis18) . Within religious studies departments and seminaries the economics of religions is more likely to be dealt with in terms of business ethics or practical guidance for the economic administration of ecclesiastical institu- tions. But we need to study the economic functions of religions in society; how money is channeled through religious institutions, # The nearest analogue in the liberal arts is probably archaeology, a field which over the years has utilized a remarkable variety of techniques and welded them into a consistent, comprehensive method.</page><page sequence="14">74 SOUNDINGS how they are subsidized, the limitations which economic feasibil- ity puts upon them, the relationships between economic success and "religious" success. We need to know the effect of religious institutions and practices upon restraint or expansion of the economy, as well as the religious roots of models for understand- ing the economy in given cultures and religious value-attitudes which condition economic values and vice versa. The physical science of religions is also neglected. The relevance of medicine to religions is organic, not merely a relic of past times when shamans practiced the healing arts. The results of the medical study of religions remains fragmentary. We do not know enough about the role of biochemical changes in religious experiences, the effect of different religious states, statuses, and beliefs on the human organism. We are largely ignorant about the use of drugs in religions and their effects, the relevance of brain wave studies to religious psychic processes, and the possibility of genetic trans- mission of certain religious propensities. A catalogue of disciplines relevant to this task cannot be com- pleted here. But mention must at least be made of the cultural arts, especially art history and music history. As in so many cases, the "religious" study of religions is too often done in a vacuum. Religious art is not just religious. It is art and it is generally created by artists rather than professional religious intellectuals. The conception of the gods, e.g., Vishnu or Krishna, as under- stood by the religious masses has often been due more to the creative imagination of artists and story tellers than it has been due to that of the theologians and priests. At least on occasion, a religious conception becomes an artistic actuality long before it becomes a religious possibility. D The secular study of religions should be carried out for the whole public. It should address itself to understanding the func- tion of religions in the culture, not only as this might interest the specialist in religious studies or individuals interested in salva- tion, but also to inform anyone who has to deal professionally with the culture. What should the politician know about reli- gions? What do the advertising copy writer, the journalist, the diplomat, the city planner, the business executive, or the doctor</page><page sequence="15">REDUCTIONISM IN THE STUDY OF RELIGIONS 75 need to know about religions to carry out their professions more adequately? In the secular situation there is a new public clientele to whom educational service is due and in all likelihood the stu- dents who study the religions will do so eventually for very different reasons. Religious studies should be so conceived that it contributes to a comprehensive education. It is not enough to teach morals or other ideological matters either as something to be emulated or simply as information about the beliefs of others. It is just as important for the public to know how the teaching of morals and the holding of moral attitudes functions in the culture. How are beliefs translated into action, or compromised, or coupled with other motive forces, isolated, shunted aside, and the like? When there is discrepancy between beliefs and actions, what is the func- tion of beliefs? It is insufficient to delineate the religious, political and economic philosophy of a Mohandas K. Gandhi or a Martin Luther King, Jr. One must ask not merely whether it is right but whether or not their programs work and under what conditions their application is possible. Answering this kind of question directs religious studies not merely to the history of ideas but also to the functioning of ideas in the actions of particular populations at particular times. The proposal is an integrated, comprehensive, stratified, con- textual study of the cultural functions of religions. We are about to be in, or could at least possibly be in, a brand new situation, unprecedented as far as I know in the humanities. In the new secular situation in which religious studies finds itself in public universities it might be possible to build up the only compre- hensive approach to a single subject matter in the liberal arts college. The idea of a comprehensive discipline devoted to a single subject matter is not unprecedented, however, in the uni- versity as a whole. The natural sciences and, to some extent, the social sciences have for years developed new marginal depart- ments and disciplines (such as bio-physics, bio-chemistry, astro- nautical medicine, and gerontology) whenever the need was felt to be great enough and implementation was financially and pro- fessionally feasible. The study of religions has a long history in private-ecclesiastical institutions. The onslaught of the study of religions in public universities is still a contemporary event, a continuing process. Presumably religious studies is not yet so</page><page sequence="16">76 SOUNDINGS solidified in structure that its basic orientation is fixed or un- alterable. Religious studies could become the comprehensive study of religions. NOTES 1. Rudolf Carnap, "Logical Foundations of the Unity of Science," Readings in Philosophical Analysis, ed.
