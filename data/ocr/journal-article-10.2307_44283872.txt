<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Perilous Hunt: Symbols in Hispanic and European Balladry. (Studies in Romance Languages, 22). Edith Randam Rogers. Lexington: The University Press of Kentucky, 1980. x + 177 pp. The dust cover of this volume states that Perilous Hunt is an examination of "The symbolic motifs clustered around six conventional narrative elements as they appear in the ballads of Europe: the hunt, games, combing, clothing, magic music, and transformations. Rogers concentrates on the Hispanic Romancero , but draws freely upon poems from nearly a score of European languages for additional examples." A satisfying overview of a work for the comparatisi. Assiduous scholars of the ballad will, however, recognize the text to be a coordinated compilation of six of Rogers' articles published in as many journals during the period 1972-75, now modified to satisfy the criteria of a monograph format. Consequently, the promise that "this book makes available important new critical tools sure to have significant results for ballad scholarship" (also on the dust cover) may lead to some disappointment for those of us expecting totally new insights into the pan-European ballad tradition. We sense from the utterances in Chapter 1, "Introduction" (pp. 1-5), that</page><page sequence="2">112 HISPANIC JOURNAL the raison d'etre for the present odre nuevo is Rogers' concern over current methodological and stylistic approaches to the analysis of the ballad: she laments "the neglect of the traditional ballad as a form of art," a by-product generated in the recent revival in the study of folklore "with its mandate of scientific objectivity" (p. 1). Thus sensitized to the problem and prepared as true esthetes, we are provided with a global orientation to the imagery, motif, and symbol of the ballad, being reminded that the genre has as a basis "The consistent translation of the narrative into visual imagery and the resulting limitation of the number of symbols;" and that the purposes of clarity in communication, ballad singers "have denied themselves a great deal of idiomatic elaboration of their respective languages in which a learned poet would feel free to indulge" (p. 3), points that are developed more fully in Chapter 4, "Clothing" (esp. pp. 88-89). The identity of meaning of a motif or symbol can only be established in ballads through context (pp. 4-5). Ideally, we should be able to understand popular poetry- "by definition"- because of an open code of imagery; "The question to ask ... is not "What does it say?' but 'How did I know?" (p. 5). With these memorable words (apparently taken from the earlier article "Clothing as a Multifarious Ballad Symbol" Western Folklore, 34 (1975), 261), the enquiry begins. Chapter 2, "Arcadia and Apocalypse: The Hunt" (pp. 6-40), repeats much of the text of "The Hunt in the Romancero and Other traditional Ballads" (Hispanic Review, 42 (1974), 133-71). Gone, however, are the useful internal rubrics of this source ("The Love Hunt," "The Ominous Hunt," "Supernatural and Enchanted Creatures in the Woods," and "Intuitive Grafting: The Hunt as a Threshold to an Imaginary World"), and the reader no longer has the convenience of having the notes at the bottom of the page (we are indebted to the Editors of the Studies in Romance Languages, however, for supplying at the top of the pages in the "Notes" section the corresponding textual ranges of the documented material). As a prelude to this section, some introductory statement on the hunting tradition in Spain and elsewhere would not have been unwelcomed. After all, the violent realism found in earlier prose treatises like the Libro de la montería of the fourteenth-century monarch Alfonso XI ("Entre Priego &amp; Luque . . . matamos y un dia un puerco que mató dos monteros &amp; dos alanos &amp; un acémila &amp; firió un caballo" [Escorial MS Y. II. 19, fol. 334v 1]) or the cool attitude of the experienced falconer exhibited by Prince Juan Manuel (d. 1348) in the Libro de la caza ("dize Don lohan que en todo quanto a dicho fasta aquí. . . non a chufa ninguna" [ed. Baist, 1880: p. 43]) isa far cry from the general lyricism that enveloped the hunting motif by the time of the Romancero general (1600). Rogers does note correctly, however, that in the ballad "Hunters abound but seldom bring home any game; in the Romancero , the game is not even likely to appear. The reason for this lies in one of the main characteristics of balladry. Ballads deal with people and their relations with other people, or sometimes other anthropomorphic beings. Hunting is thus not the subject, but the scene, the circumstance, the atmosphere" (p. 6). She then examines the function of symbols of the pastime, including the hawk and hound, in ballads from Spain (Castile, Asturias, Catalonia, Basque region), the Canary Islands, Brittany, Chile, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Holland, the Piedmont, Portugal, Lithuania, Russia, Scotland, Serbia, Sicily, and in Sephardic verses of corresponding Spanish romances. Editions and collections employed include Wolf and Hofmann's Primavera y flor de romances (reissued by Menéndez y Pelayo in Antología de poetas líricos castellanos , vols, 8 &amp; 9), Child's The English and Scottish Popular Ballads (5 vols. Boston, 1882-98 [rpt., we might add, New</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 113 York: Dover Publications, 1965]), to name but a few. In the Spanish Romancero , the hunt that leads to the husband's absence is seen frequently to aid and abet his wife's infidelity (e.g., "A caza es ido," Prim. 136a and "Mi marido es ido a caza," Menédez y Pelayo, 10: 87); whereas "Abduction during the hunter's absence from home is particularly frequent in Russian byliny (epic ballads)" (p. 13). Rogers gives us an overview of other used of the motif as well: since the chase "is readily accepted as an explanation of a man's absence ... it is natural to give it also as a false excuse" (p. 14) as in the Portuguese "Promessa de noivado" (Braga, Romanceiro geral [Coimbra, 1867], p. 39), the Piedmontese "Parricida" (Nigra, Canti popolari del Piemont [Turin, 1888; rpt. Turin, 1957], p. 88), and the German "Ulinger" and "Die verkaufte Müllerin" (Deutsche Volksleider mit ihren Melodien: Balladen. Ed. John Meier [Berlin/Freiburg, 1935], 2:72; 4:321, 322, 324)^ Of interest regarding the evolution of the hunt motif and the broader issue of the long- term success of any lyric motif is Rogers' overview of the "lonely, futile hunt" and the "dismal hunt" (pp. 37-40) which eventually would include the element of "the aggressive huntress" in romances like "Vio venir un cazador" Cane, popular de la Provincia de Madrid. Eds. Schneider and Romèu Figueras [Barcelona, 1951-52], 1:45). Some of us will surely disagree with Rogers that these liberated individuals, the lyrical descendents of the Archpriest of Hita's serranas, necessarily represent "a supernatural element in the hunting scene" (p. 39), however. Chapter 3, "Measure and Mock-Up: Games" (pp. 41-57), modifies and expands somewhat the text of "Games of Muscle, Mind, and Chance" (Hispania, 55 [1942], 419-27). Although it might have best been treated in the preceding chapter under a section "leisure-time alternatives to the hunt," Rogers argues forcefully (if not totally convincingly) for the scenario of the homo ludens as a major symbol in the ballad: "since action, conflict, and crisis are the stuff of both ballads and games, they form a natural association" (p. 41). With this criterion, it seems to us that almost any diversion could be viewed as a potential mot iff. The intertextual observations that are made like "a card game even becomes the occasion for homicide in a Piedmontese ballad, 'Mal Ferito' (Nigra, p. 170): words lead to knives, knives to pistols" (p. 47) does more to stimulate interest in the "popular nature" of our local scandle sheet than to hone esthetic sensibility. Far more interesting are Rogers' views on the gaming scenario with respect to the courtship or the fate of protagonists of the ballad (pp. 50-57), her insights to the diversions of the Renaissance courts, and our own realization that while popular poetry was not without some social pretentiousness (as in the lament for the Bonny Earl of Murray ["He was a braw gallant," Child 181 ]), it was for the most part extremely democratic in outlook, particularly in Spain (as in the romance "No le muestra a cortar leña" [Romancero tradicional de las lenguas hispánicas ... Ed. Menendez Pidal et al. (Madrid, 1957-), 2:283], on the upbringing of Fernán González). Chapters 4 and 5, "A Symbol for All Seasons: Clothing" (pp. 58-59) and "A Buffer for a Taboo: Combing" (pp. 90-108) may be examined jointly inasmuch as they deal with two closely related items: apparel and grooming. The former chapter was originally published under the title "Clothing as a Multifarious Ballad Symbol" (Western Folklore , 34 [1975], 261-97), which contains some useful textual divisions ("Hero and Heroine," "Birth," "Courtship," "Engagement or Enticement," "Wedding," "Thwarted Wedding," "Marriage and Adultery," "Death and Mourning," and "Some Reasons for the Use of Clothing Symbolism") that are now omitted. White maintaining that the ballad overworks clothing as a symbol (p. 58), Rogers nonetheless manages to cite</page><page sequence="4">114 HISPANIC JOURNAL and document no fewer than 92 different examples of its employment. With respect to the Romancero viejo, a case is made (pp. 74-76) for "a multiple connection among La bella en misa, Sofía mía , and the large European group of Lord Thomas-Tristes noces , all of which employ clothing in the form typical of each linguistic group" (p. 76). "Clothing" concludes with a consideration of the visual qualities of oral art: despite the aforementioned overuse of the symbol, it greatly assisted in fixing basic images in the collective mind of the audience. Alluding to the nature of tableaux and contemporary comic strips, Rogers provides the incisive observation that "it does not seem probable that singers either consciously or subconsciously adjusted their style to some form of visual presentation that precluded continuous or subtly movements and fine shading, requiring a series of images that revealed the development of the plot through conspicuous changes, bold colors, and strong contrasts" (p. 88). Chapter 5, "Combing," indebted to the article "The Moral Standing of the Unkempt" ( Southern Folklore Quarterly, 36 [1972], 144-59), complements the discussion of the preceding chapter: "Of all symbolic acts . . . combing is probably the favorite one for expressing sexuality . . . [This] obvious tactile sensuality of combing, besides being less burdened with the associations with wealth that tended to dominate the motifs involving clothes, make it a more concentrated and more powerful symbol for themes related to the libido" (p. 90). At the extreme, it is manifested as "lousing," that time-honored tradition which "occurs in folktales as a service by young girls to their lovers, by abducted princesses to dragons by a lady to Saint George (who liberated her from the dragon), and was requested also by a dead man recalled to the earth by his mistress (Child, 1 : 487)" (p. 104). "Combing" appears to have been reworked with respect to its source publication more than the preceding four chapters; we would like to inquire whether more scholarship on the motif will be forthcoming. Perilous Hunt up to now has dealt with universal symbols, imagery, and motifs in balladry. However, Chapters 6 and 7, "A Case of Vested Interest: Magic Music" (pp. 109-34) and "Metempsychosis or Miracle: Transformations in Conde Olinos " (pp. 135-48) become somewhat limited in scope in their examination of the romance "Conde Olinos." Chapter 6 derives from the article "Magic Music: A Self-Centered Ballad Motiff" (Kentucky Romance Quarterly, 22 [1975], 263-92). Herein, Rogers takes issue with Leo Spitzer's interpretation of the supernatural in the romance "Conde Arnaldos" outlined in "The Folkloristic Pre-Stage of the Spanish Romance 'Conde Arnaldos.' " (Hispanic Review , 23 [1955], 173-87), and concludes that "the magic-music motif could not be accepted as evidenced of the supernatural ..." (pp. 133-34). In Chapter 7, transformations," which closely follows "El Conde Olinos: Metempsychosis or Miracle" ( Bulletin of Hispanic Studies, 50 [1973], 325-39), Rogers examines several versions of the romance paradigmatically with respect to five transformation categories ("Plants," "Birds," "Shrine," "Spring" [plus "River" in one version], and "Healing powers") that can be found therein. This exercise is most ambitious from the standpoint of genealogy, and leads to a final statement that seems contradictory in view of her comments in the Introduction to the book: " Conde Olinos is one of the most impressive examples of a ballad needing to be examined by various methods. Far from replacing the research of genealogy and the ordering of versions and variants by a scientific method, a contextual interpretation of symbols can begin only after such spade-work has been done" (p. 148). Apparently, Rogers does not find the aforementioned "mandate of scientific objectivity" (p. 1) in folklore studies totally undesirable after all. In lieu of a formal Conclusion, she closes</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS 115 with the observation that "Whether a popular ballad lives or dies depends . . . on its ability to evoke new associations that touch the values and concerns of successive generations" (p. 148). Thus comforted by the thought that the drudgery of ballad scholarship can find companionship at the more sublime level of investigation, we eagerly turned to Perilous Hunt's Bibliography (pp. 161-65), expecting to find a superb compilation of the latest research in international popular poetry, only to discover that of the 89 entries- including Rogers' 1972 "Sofía mía" article- the most recent is Armistead and Silverman's The Judeo-Spanish Chapbooks of Yacob Abraham Yoná (Berkeley, 1971), which oddly enough is described in the Preface as not being "fully utilized" (p. ix), only to be cited in the chapter "Magic Music" (p. 133) and elsewhere. Consequently, Perilous Hunt neglects almost all ballad scholarship of the last decade, which greatly limits its critical depth.2 While Rogers is to be commended for her esthetic sensibility and the exposition of her arguments, we wish that she could have taken greater advantage of the current "spadework" that is recognized at the end of Chapter 7 as being of value. Physically, the volume is attractive, blue binding with gold lettering having replaced the beige and brown combination of earlier numbers in the Studies in Romance Languages Series.
