(SP-533) Integration of reliability, maintainabil- ity and quality parameters in design. H. J. Ba- jaría, Multiface, Inc. Synthesizing different customer and functional require- ments into an acceptable design configuration within a given space constraints is a challenging task for design engi- neers. The principles for designing efficiency, noise levels, maneuverability, safety, durability, etc. into the product are well understood. However, designing for reliability, main- tainability and quality turns out to be a long-drawn labori- ous process due to unavailability of simplified design proce- dures. The author in this paper develops the understanding of reliability, maintainability and quality design principles and methods for products, with specific reference to vehicle designs. 830002. (SP-534) Cylinder head gasket requirements for opened and closed deck 390-engines. Horst Nauman, REINZ-Dichtungs-GmbH, Neu-Ulm. The REINZ company relies on a twenty year experience in the development and high volume production of cylinder head gaskets for aluminum engines. Basic requirements which these gaskets are to comply with are discussed. Above all, thermal expansions of components resulting from the decisively different thermal coefficients of steel and aluminum are of special importance in terms of tech- nology and design. It is described which structural aids will serve to ob- tain the distribution of sealing pressure which service calls for. Reasons are discussed which have led to the structural design of cylinder head gaskets for those engines which are built today on the base of Reynolds 390-Alloy. 830003. (SP-534) Casting engine blocks in GK Al Si 17 Cu 4 Mg. Gerhard Renninger, Dietrich Aben- droth, and Martin Bolien, Mahle GmbH. Mahle produces cast aluminum 390 alloy engine blocks for both Porsche AG and Daimler-Benz AG. Mahle has been involved virtually from the beginning of both companies' 390 alloy engine programs. This paper details Mahle's work in the development of the Porsche 928 V8 engine block, as well as the Mercedes 3.8 V8 block. It also details the production techniques used in the production of these blocks, and the cautions that must be exercised. 830004. (SP-534) The new Porsche 944 4-cylinder- aluminum engine application of the 390 alloy based on the experience gathered with air- and water-cooled Porsche engines. Paul Hensler, Management Engine Development, Porsche AG. The basic Porsche 944 engine was derived from the 928 V8 engine, which is demonstrated by cylinder distance, same crankcase design and same valve train. The engine block is cast in an open deck process with aluminum - silicon alloy 390. 10 years experience with this alloy on 911 air-cooled and lately on 928 water-cooled engines has proven the use for aluminum engine blocks without liners. With the use of 2 counter-rotating silent shafts, to compensate rotating masses of the 2nd order, the character of a 6 cylinder engine with respect to noise and vibration is achieved. A digital engine electronic system in conjunction with a high compression ratio and a thermo dynamically opti- mized combustion chamber achieve a very high power output with low emission and good economy. The systematic use of aluminum and plastics result in a low engine weight which even with 25% more displace- ment and 30% more power result in basically the same weight as the present 4 cylinder engine. 830005. (SP-534) Light alloy engines - experience gained from research and development. Wolfram Dahm and Rainer Georg Putter, Daimler-Benz Aktien- gesellschaft. Daimler-Benz has more than 20 years of experience with aluminum engines. This paper details experience with alu- minum, particularly 390 alloy. It also compares the Mercedes V8 390 alloy engines with comparable grey iron V8 engines. Weight and energy savings are particularly noted. 830006. (SP-534) General Motors 390 aluminum alloy 60° V6 engine. E. G. Jacobsen, Advance Product En- gineering, General Motors Corp. General Motors' 390 alloy 60° V6 engine is an aluminum version of the cast iron engine used in GM's X car, as well as other models. The paper details the development of this experimental aluminum engine. It explores the concept of the engine, as well as the equipment and processes used to produce it. The paper also touches on the requirements for satisfactory operation of an aluminum 390 alloy engine, and compares its performance to a comparable cast iron engine. 830007. (SP-534) Aluminum 390 alloy engine blocks: de- sign and manufacturing. Hans-Heinz Hofmann, Klaus Schellmann, and Erich Wacker, Karl Schmidt GmbH, Neckarsulm, W. Germany. This paper begins with a discussion of the various types of aluminum engine blocks. It compares costs, designs, and various production aspects of the different types. It also details experience at Karl Schmidt with 390 alloy blocks. 830008. (SP-534) The Thunder aluminum 390 alloy air- craft engine. Richard P. MacCoon and Robert P. Ernst, Thunder Engines Corp. Thunder Engines Corporation is developing a new family of fuel efficient, compact, lightweight, liquid cooled, turbo- 21</page><page sequence="3">830008-830016 charged, all-aluminum power plants which will have wide- spread application in general aviation. Called "Thunder Engines", these power plants are the first new high-performance liquid-cooled reciprocating air- craft engines to be introduced for more than 20 years. Thunder Engines are designed to provide significant cost and operating advantages for powering a wide range of agricultural, commuter, utility and business aircraft. 1983 SAE Transactions 830009. (SP-534) Engineering control for high volume 390 die casting. Harry M. Ward, III, Doehler-Jarvis Castings, N. L. Industries, Inc., Toledo, OH. To functionally replace cast iron with aluminum and avoid the cost and design penalties associated with wear plates and steel inserts, an aluminum alloy with physical and wear properties superior to those available in 380 was required. 390 was first used, in high volume, during the early 1970's by General Motors for the Vega engine block. When the Vega was superseded, extensive use of 390 stopped, but its unique ability to be used in applications subject to wear was not forgotten. This paper addresses the major engineering and metallurgical principles which must be considered and how they influence the various aspects of casting design and production. 830010. Reynolds 390 engine technology. John L. Jorstad, Reynolds Metals ¡Co. The Reynolds' 390 engine technology eliminates the need for iron bore liners in aluminum engines. This allows cast- ing of the cylinder block and bores as an integral unit. The technology is a three-part system consisting of the hyper- eutectic 390 aluminum-silicon alloy, compatible pistons and a special cylinder bore finish. When properly applied, it can produce a lightweight, strong, compact and relatively low- cost aluminum engine block. 830012. Turbochargers with hydraulic assist. S. G. Ti- money, University College Dublin (Ireland). This paper provides design and test data on a crankshaft driven hydraulic system for adding auxiliary energy to the compressor power input of an exhaust gas turbocharger during truck engine acceleration under load, or during heavy "lug-down" operation. The system is applicable to 2 or 4 stroke engines. With a 2 stroke engine the system allows the turbocharger to replace the conventional crank- shaft driven scavenge blower even at start-up. Critical exhaust smoke is significantly reduced both in intensity and in duration, and the engine rev/min at which peak torque occurs can be lowered by 10 to 15% of the speed range. The hydraulic system comprises a high pressure gear type pump which is driven from the engine crankshaft, through a suitable clutch, and transfers energy to the turbo- charger shaft by way of a simple nozzle jetting engine sump oil, at high velocity, on to the buckets of a miniature Pelton wheel turbine, about 35 to 50 mm in diameter. 1983 SAE Transactions 830013. Design features and operating experiences of the aerodyne Dallas VATN turbocharger. John R. Arvin and Norbert L. Osborn, Aerodyne Dallas, Dallas, TX. An advanced turbocharger has been developed through the prototype stage which has demonstrated performance in actual engine installations. The design addresses many of the problem areas associated with contemporary turbo- chargers. The design features include variable area turbine nozzles, self-contained lubrication, and a rotor shaft sup- ported by ball bearings. Several operational experiences are discussed which illustrate improved transient response and improved diesel engine specific fuel consumption. The oper- ational experience includes diesel and spark ignition. Verti- cal shaft installations are also included. 830014. Turbocharging for fuel efficiency. H. C. Watson, E. E. Milkins, and K. Roberts, University of Mel- bourne; and W. Bryce, General Motors Holden's Ltd. The arguments are given for the application of a 1.3 litre turbocharged spark ignition engine, as a substitute for a 2 litre normally aspirated engine as the power plant for a compact-sized car in the late 80's. Three stages of the pro- ject leading to an optimised engine-turbocharger package are outlined. Achievement of Stage 1, leading to evaluation of a non-optimised configuration, will be reported. Descrip- tion includes the use of a separately driven supercharger to define operating limits in the experimental variable matrix comprising compression ratio, boost pressure, EGR rate and spark retard at the knock limit. Computer programs for the optimising stages of the project are outlined. The cur- rent status of the project is reported, where, even at this early stage, fuel consumption reductions of 11-22% have been achieved under simulated urban driving conditions. 83Q016. The design of passenger car cast aluminum wheels. Trevor J. Brown, General Motors Corp. Permanent mold cast aluminum wheels have been widely used as original equipment on passenger cars for a number of years. Testing and field experience together with manu- facturing and plant processing experience has resulted in the development of a number of recommended design prac- tices which are outlined in this paper. Methods used to test that design requirements have been met will be presented. Basic wheel designs, rigid and flexible, will be discussed together with the currently used mounting face configura- tions. Detail design features such as rim contour, nut boss, valve hole, hub pilot, mounting face and window openings will be reviewed. Future design and manufacturing trends will be discussed. 22</page><page sequence="4">830017-830023 830017. Pore-Free aluminum wheels and other O.E. cast- ings. Aigis L. Lapsys, Peat Manufacturing Co. Use of highly styled aluminum wheels and aluminum cast- ings for various chassis components has dramatically in- creased in the O.E. community due to the styling and weight reduction opportunities afforded. The processes historically considered for aluminum chassis components have been forgings, permanent mold castings (low pressure and gravity) and occasionally high pressure die castings. The advent of the Pore-Free process in the United States affords the design engineer a new technology that combines the benefits of high strength, ability to heat treat, absence of gas porosity, weldability and a high degree of dimensional accuracy in a single process. Basic work over the past two years has resulted in a U.S. talent-based Pore-Free die cast- ing process capable of producing high elongation, high ulti- mate and yield strength, hydrostatically sound and dimen- sionally precise castings suitable for styled wheels, various stressed chassis components and pressurized vessels such as power steering gear housings and pump bodies - all at com- parable or lower cost than with current production meth- ods. 830018. A chronology of forged aluminum wheel develop- ment at Alcoa. David L. Kerr, Aluminum Com- pany of America. In the late 1940's Alcoa began marketing forged aluminum disc wheels for Class VII and VIII highway tractors, and in 1972 stylized passenger car wheels. This paper covers the evolution of some early pre-production designs to the pre- sent. 830019. Ford mechanically assembled aluminum radiator. Thomas R. Veling, Nancy E. Marsh, Gene D. Dickirson, and Joseph R. Glaser, Ford Motor Company, Climate Control Division. This paper discusses the design, development and manufac- turing of the Ford mechanically assembled aluminum radi- ator. This new product is lighter in weight, lower in cost, and has superior reliability and durability compared to its copper and brass counterpart. Extensive research and devel- opment by Ford of coolants, corrosion inhibitors, and the use of an air side sealant at the tube to header interface has made the mechanically assembled aluminum radiator very attractive for vehicle applications where moderate cooling requirements exist. 830021. Brazing aluminum automotive heat exchanger assemblies using a non-corrosive flux process. D. G. W. Claydon, Alean International, Ltd., Kingston Laboratories, Kingston, Canada; and A. Sugihara, Nippon Light Metals Research Lab- oratory Ltd., Kambara, Japan. The brazing process for aluminum which uses the non- corrosive NOCOLOK^ flux iß now fully developed and proven and a number of licensees are successfully operating the process on a production basis in the United States, Great Britain, West Germany and Japan making a variety of heat exchanger parts and assemblies. This paper describes the process and the key advan- tages over the other brazing processes for aluminum now in production use. In particular, this paper deals with the methods of production which can be used and describes one of the fully developed continuous tunnel furnace production facilities which are operating iń Japan, in addition, the types of automotive heat exchangers being brazed with the process are briefly described. 830022. Development of a welded copper-brass automo- tive radiator. J. H. Anders, J. J. Carravetta, R. A. Nutt, and Z. P. Saperstein, Modine Mfg. Co., Racine, Wis. During the last several years, Modine Manufacturing Com- pany has been developing a high reliability, durable heavy- duty (class 7 and 8) truck radiator. This development work has culminated in the Beta-Weld™ radiator which was commercially offered to the heavy duty truck markets beginning iń June 1982. The objective was to research and develop a heavy- duty truck radiator that possesses substantially improved reliability and durability compared to the "state-of-the-art" soldered tube-to-header joint radiator. In addition, it was desired to improve resistance to solder-bloom corrosion which is sometimes a severe field problem. The extensive process and product R&amp;D resulted in the development of a copper/brass, welded tube^to-header joint radiator core, that also incorporates seam-welded tubes. The air-side of the tube-to-header joints are soldered to provide a "dual bond" that reinforces and seals the weld joint. A comprehensive test program was initiated to charac- terize the structural performance of the Beta-Weld™ radia- tor. This paper presents data that compare the structural behavior of conventional-soldered radiators to Beta-Weld™ radiators. Thermal cycle, pressure cycle, and shake-test data are emphasized. In addition, extensive field-test results are also presented. The data show that the Beta-Weld™ radiator possesses exceptional durability and reliability. The results demon- strate a substantial improvement in resistance to tube-to- header joint failure. Virtually absolute immunity to solder- bloom corrosion has also been documented. Field fleet testing verified the laboratory evaluations. 830023. Continuous roll-bonding: a means of manufactur- ing heat exchanger parts and components« C. W. Fulton, Algoods Division, Alean Canada Prod- ucts, Ltd. The limited number of heat exchanger applications for Roll-Bond is due to existing methods of manufacture. New technology has been developed to change this. By bonding and inflating coils rather than short pieces, continuous roll- 23</page><page sequence="5">830023 - 830032 bonding increases design flexibility. Very long lengths, ligh- ter gauges, straight tubes or groups of tubes are now possible in addition to conventional silk-screened patterns. Greater productivity makes the new product more economical and combinations of continuous Roll-bond with alclâdding and brazing are especially interesting possibilities when design- ing cost effective, high performance heat exhangers. 830024. Drawn light wall aluminum tubing for automotive heat exchangers comes of age in the USA. Ri- chard Knoll, Jr., Norsk Hydro Aluminum, Inc., Rockledge, FL. This paper traces historical developments and related pro- gressive improvements for drawn light wall aluminum tub- ing applications in automotive radiator and heating systems since its inception in 1974/75 in Europe to its current status in the U.S. car industry and its projected growth rate until 1987. The paper discusses the influence on tube design engi- neering and associated mechanical and metallurgical con- siderations with reference to heat load factors caused by the impact of such changes as, for example, body size of the American automobile, aerodynamic (drag coefficient styl- ing, type/size/performance of engines, etc.). 830027. European activity concerning engine oil viscosity classification - part IV - the effects of shear rate and temperature on the viscosity of multigrade oils. B. Wright, Shell Research, Ltd., England; N. M. van Os, Shell Research B.V., The Nether- lands; and J. A. Lyons, Esso Chemical Ltd., Eng- land. Three mathematical models have been used to correlate over a thousand high-shear-rate viscosity data generated by CEC Committee CL-23 on multigrade reference oils, using shear rates up to 16000 s"1 at 25°C and up to 1300 000 s'1 at 150°C. The work has established that all three models provide a good fit for the data and that there is little differ- ence between their precisions of fit. The constants found by fitting the three models to the high-shear-rate viscosities of fifteen multigrade reference oils of special interest to the CEC and the SAE/ASTM are recorded for future use. 830028. The effect of current design trends in automotive fuel economy upon engine oil viscometric require- ments. R. G. Tittel, Burmah-Castrol Inc.; and T. W. Selby, SAVANT, Inc. The fuel efficiency of the automobile is the focus of major engineering efforts and has been for ten years. One of the questions frequently raised concerning these engineering trends toward improved fuel efficiency has been of what effect these trends will have on the life of the engine, partic- ularly on the oil's ability to maintain hydrodynamic lubri- cation. The authors assess the present and developing situa- tion using a sizable database constructed from the engineering data and sales of the last 12 years and contrast- ing this information with the theory and practice of lubrica- tion. 830029. The effect of VI improvers and resultant base oil volatility on automotive oil economy with SAE 5W-40 oils. D. C. Carison, Shell Development Co., Westhollow Research Center, Houston, TX. This work was conducted to evaluate the effects resultiilg from the use of various VI improvers in multigrade engine oils on automobile oil economy. The test oils were formu- lated to be of similar viscosity in the SAE 5W-40 viscosity grade. The VI improvers tested covered a range of perma- nent shear stability, temporary shear stability and thicken- ing characteristics. Engine oil volatility was the only variable which could be identified as having a significant effect on automobile oil economy. The oils containing the styrene/diene VI im- prover were less volatile than all other oils tested and pro- vided statistically significant improvements in oil economy. Permanent shear stability, high temperature/high shear viscosity, and in-use (used-oil) viscosity could not be identi- fied as having a significant effect on automobile oil econ- omy of the SAE 5W-40 oils studied. 830030. Effects of isotropic pressure on the high tempera- ture high shear viscosity of motor oils. John F. Hutton, Bernard Jones, and Terence W. Bates, Shell Research Ltd., Thornton Research Centre. The viscosity of 10W/40 motor oils formulated with differ- ent viscosity index (VI) improvers has been measured at pressures up to 200 MPa (2000 bar) over a wide tempera- ture and shear rate range. The response of viscosity to pressure was found to depend on the chemical nature of the VI improver at both low and high shear rates. As a conse- quence, the ranking of the 150°C viscosities of polymer- thickened oils can be different at high pressures to that observed in conventional atmospheric pressure viscometers. These effects of VI improver type on high pressure viscosity appear to be relevant to wear in journal bearings of fired engines; thus in experiments carried out in the ALI Bearing Distress Test, bearing weight loss of multigrade oils con- taining different VI improvers correlated better with high pressure, high shear viscosities than with high shear viscosi- ties measured at atmospheric pressure. 1983 SAE Transactions 830032. Fatigue of automotive high strength steel sheets and their welded joints. Masatoshi Shinozaki, To- shiyuki Kato, and Toshio Irie, Research Labora- tories, Kawasaki Steel Corp.; and Isao Takahashi, Mizushima Works, Kawasaki Steel Corp. Fatigue properties in various types of high strength steel sheets for automotive use and their spot and arc welded joints were investigated. In steel sheets and strain-aged sheets, fatigue limit stresses and notch sensitivities depend 24</page><page sequence="6">830032-830037 on not only the tensile strength but also the yield strength. Two methods for improving fatigue strength of spot welded high strength steel joints were found. One is to generate moderate expulsion during welding with a current just above the upper lobe curve and another is to conduct a controlled tempering treatment during the welding sched- ule. By these methods, fatigue strengths at 107 cycles of spot welded high strength steel joints increase by about twice as compared with those by the conventional welding method. 830033. A review of the fatigue properties of spot-welded sheet steels. James A. Davidson, United states Steel Corp., Research Laboratory. Over the past several years, the automotive industry has used increasing amounts of high-strength sheet steels to reduce vehicle weight for improved fuel economy. It is im- portant that these high strength steels exhibit spot-weld fatigue characteristics at least equal to those of previous lower strength low-carbon steels. This study reviews the spot-weld fatigue performance of uncoated sheet steels with respect to material strength, spot-weld diameter, sheet thickness, and the number and array of spot welds. Models used to describe the state of stress around the spot weld are also reviewed. Selected results contained in the literature are reevaluated using fracture-mechanics concepts. Com- ments are given regarding fatigue-crack growth in spot welds with respect to the cyclic-stress ratio and threshold- fatigue limit. Limitations of current theories used to evalu- ate fatigue performance of spot welds are discussed, and an alternative approach to interpreting such data is recom- mended. 1983 SAE Transactions 830034. A fracture-mechanics and system-stiffness ap- proach to fatigue performance of spot-welded sheet steels. James A. Davidson and Edward J. Imhof, Jr., United States Steel Corp., Research Laboratory. To improve fuel economy, the automotive manufacturers have been gradually incorporating lighter gage, higher strength sheet steels. For the same fatigue loads, the oper- ating stresses of these spot-welded lighter-gage sheets will be greater causing a concomitant reduction in fatigue life. This paper describes the results of a program using fracture-mechanics concepts to determine the fatigue life of spot-welded connections of various stiffness. A model is developed which predicts the fatigue life, and shows that life increases with increasing joint siffness. Two types of fatigue cracking were observed and found to be competing throughout the fatigue life. The type of crack- ing dominating the final failure was also related to the joint stiffness. Above a critical stiffness, shear failure could oc- cur. Below this critical stiffness, sheet failure resulted, and the fatigue life was related to -'/A0. 1 983 SAE Transactions 830035. An empirical method for estimating the fatigue resistance of tensile-shear spot-welds. F. V. Lawrence, Jr., P. C. Wang, and H. T. Corten, University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. An empirical method which is based principally on esti- mates of the fatigue crack initiation life (Ni) has been devel- oped which predicts the fatigue resistance of tensile-shear spot welds in the long life regime. The method uses Bas- quin's law and Peterson's equation to estimate Ni and thus is founded on the fatigue behavior of smooth specimens and modelling of the fatigue notch size effect. The fatigue notch factor (Kf) required in this analysis was obtained from Pook's relationships for the stress intensity factors of tensile-shear spot welds. Estimates of Ni are added to esti- mates of the fatigue crack propagation life Np to obtain the total fatigue life (Nt) but in the long life regime Np can usually be neglected. The improvement of tensile-shear spot weld fatigue resistance through manipulation of geometry and material property variables are discussed with the aid of the model. The model predicts that nugget diameter, sheet thickness, and residual stress control offer the best possibilities for fatigue life improvement. 830036. New results in colloid display technology. H. Rachner and J. H. Morrissy, SWF-Spezialfabrik für Autozubehör, Gustav Rau GMBH, Bietig- heim/West Germany. Recent improvements in the synthesis procedure for colloi- dal suspensions have led to reproducible suspensions and a reduced production time. In the past year, the previous disadvantages of high drive voltage, slow response at low temperatures and re- stricted operating lifetime have been substantially reduced. Present displays operate at 18 volts (CMOS compatible) with response times substantially less than 500 ms at -30°C and also have improved lifetimes under both storage and operating conditions. New test methods have been developed to assist the understanding of the degradation process under operating conditions. The latest technical data for colloidal displays are presented. 1983 SAE Transactions 830037. A comparison of various types of LC displays for automotive application. H. Baeger, VDO Adolf Schindling AG, Schwalbach, Germany. In view of the wide range of opto-electronic displays for automotive application, the car manufacturer is faced with the problem that the technology employed might be out- dated within one to two years following their introduction in the vehicle. In this particular «field of liquid crystal dis- plays the user is confused by the great variety of display effects. Therefore, this paper presents a comparative anal- ysis of the present promising types of liquid crystal displays in order to help the user make his choice. 25</page><page sequence="7">830037 - 830043 For more than four years, VDO has made great in- vestments in the development of LCDs. This year, the VDO plant for clusters in Babenhausen has been expanded by another production plant for large-area liquid crystal dis- plays (standard or hybrid displays) for automotive dash- board instrumentation. The production systems especially developed for this purpose allow for both the production of TN cells as well as of dichroic displays, without involving great difficulties. Therefore, we assume that a comparative analysis of the individual technologies will not require par- ticular pre-conditions. 830038. Which LCD technology - dichroic or T/N? De- rick Jones and Frank LeVien, Electronic Displays System. The recent refinements of dye synthesis in the dichroic technology have permitted this form of liquid crystal to be utilized in demanding environments where quality and reli- ability are paramount. Likewise, the twisted nematic form of liquid crystal continues to be widely used in timepieces, calculators and a wide variety of consumer related prod- ucts. The basic question this paper proposes to answer, however, is which of these types of liquid crystal affords the most promising future for automotive applications where requirements for versatility and improved quality standards are essential. The dichroic technology possesses unique qualities and characteristics absent in the twisted nematic liquid crystal. This paper, while concentrating on the di- chroic technology, will nevertheless discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each technology, touch upon areas of cost, sunlight readability and color capability, incorpora- tion of driver electronics and lighting in a self-contained module ready for immediate application into new instru- ment designs, and the current Research and Development and its implication for future applications. Finally, a con- clusion will be made as to which liquid crystal technology better meets the present application requirements in the automotive as well as other industries. 830039. A new construction approach to liquid crystal display. T. Hashimoto, K. Akeyoshi, T. Minowa, and H. Araki, Asahi Glass Company, Ltd. Liquid Crystal Display is in the process of achieving the supreme position as an automotive instrument panel; it will replace all other existing automotive displays on dash- boards. However, a number of problems on technical support remain to be solved. Focused the most among them is the strong demand of a highly reliable connection method. The new connection technique by soldering was pre- sented in the previous paper. This paper describes the reliability and fabrication process of the new connection and its application to Driver IC on flexible P.C.B, and Chip on Glass instrument panels. 1983 SAE Transactions 830040. A new LCD instrument panel for automobiles. F. Kadoo, K. Akeyoshi, and I. Terada, Asahi Glass Company, Ltd. Under existing circumstances, the practical constructions of liquid crystal display (LCD) devices for automotive appli- cation are very few and very complicated. At the moment there are few research papers that un- dertake this topic. This paper presents a new practical construction of LCD, that is not only easy to assemble but also has good legibility. A sample LCD instrument panel, which has the new construction, is shown in this report. 830041. An LCD instrument panel for an automotive ap- plication. G. A. Walkush, L. J. Owen, D. A. Ross, and G. Ackerman, AC Spark Plug Div.; and K. T. Milne, Chevrolet Motor Div. The selection of liquid crystal display technology for the microprocessor controlled instrument cluster in the new Chevrolet Corvette allowed the development of a novel and attractive multi-colored display with greatly enhanced driver information features. Polarizers, protective film and masking were specifically selected for the three LCD cells. Lighting and registration challenges were met while main- taining buildability, and electronics and software were de- veloped to perform the many functions and features of the complex design in a reliable fashion. 830042. An LCD driver information center for automo- tive applications. G. A. Streelman, II, C. M. Be- low, and H. P. Shagena, AC Spark Plug. An automotive diagnostic package has been developed which utilizes a systems approach to convey information such as lamp failures, improper fluid levels, and various other warnings as well as service reminders. It incorporates a microprocessor controlled liquid crystal display consisting of printed messages and an outline of a vehicle; thus a message will be supplemented with an indication of the problem location on the vehicle. The unit is designed for English or Metric use, allowing the miles or kilometers remaining to recommended services to be displayed upon command. 830043. Multi-function large scale glass vacuum fluores- cent displays for automotive applications. Takao Kishino, Tadashi Mizohata, and Thomas L. Py- kosz, Futaba Corp. Vacuum Fluorescent Displays have been manufactured for automotive applications for over six years. During this pe- riod, various technological advances, such as increased brightness, multicolors, and decreased power consumption have led to the rapid expansion of the Vacuum Fluorescent Display (VFD) market. 26</page><page sequence="8">830043 - 830049 The following paper will discuss high brightness dis- plays for automotive applications, focusing on large scale displays. These large scale displays are now becoming prac- tical for mass production. We will discuss various design problems that are encountered and how to solve them; plus what performance criteria is targeted for future improve- ment. 1983 SAE Transactions 830044. Front luminous vacuum fluorescent display. Kiyoshi Morimoto and Joe M. Dorris, Futaba Corp. Front Luminous Vacuum Fluorescent Display is a variation of the vacuum fluorescent display technology which offers improvements in the areas of visibility, viewing angle, oper- ating temperature range, and life. This technology has been discussed since the invention of the conventional vacuum fluorescent display (VFD) because of its structural similar- ity to the CRT. Today, Front Luminous Vacuum Fluorescent Display (FLVFD) technology is becoming a production reality. Since July, 1980, the following areas have been studied and evaluated to bring FLVFD to the state of commerciali- zation: (1) Design study and trial production (2) Development of the transmissive anode and wiring pattern forming technology (3) Development of the phosphor coating technique (4) Study of the visual recognition characteristics (5) Reliability evaluation 1983 SAE Transactions 830045.

Chin, NEC Electronics USA, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA. A surface light emitting fluorescent indicator panel (FIP™) has been developed to reduce the distance from the lighted surface to the front panel surface. This offers a better view- ing angle and easier read display. An extension of the previously developed multi-color FIP's has been made to allow variable colors dependent on the level of input driving voltages. The theory and experimental data on these recent de- velopments are discussed. 830046. High efficiency low cost vacuum fluorescent dis- play power supply. Frederick O. R. Miesterfeld, Engineering &amp; Research Office, Chrysler Corp. The use of a switching power supply to provide the anode, grid and filament power for a vacuum fluorescent display has been the recent subject of numerous papers, periodicals and manufacturers' application notes. This paper, however, develops a math modeling technique that can be used to evaluate many different types of supplies. The results show that none of the power supplies available truly regulate both filament and display power. A control method that could be used to regulate both is evaluated. A simple pulse width modulation control design driving a miniature autotrans- former, which results from use of the math modeling tech- nique, will also be evaluated. The electromagnetic interfer- ence (EMI) properties missing from most of the evaluations for the other switching regulator power supplies shall be given along with a discussion on designing for low EMI properties. 1983 SAE Transactions 830047. (P-121) Pedestrian accidents in South Australia over two decades. A. J. McLean and A. J. Wood- ward, N.H. &amp; M.R.C. Road Accident Research Unit, The University of Adelaide. The paper reviews changes in the pattern of pedestrian accidents and pedestrian injuries in South Australia during the two decades from 1960. The data are drawn from two in-depth accident studies, each based on a representative sample of road accidents to which an ambulance was called, conducted in 1963-64 and 1976-77, and the road accident records of the South Australian Police Force. The paper examines the changes which have occurred in the frequency and nature of pedestrian accidents in conjunction with the more widespread use of controlled pedestrian road cross- ings, and also the marked liberalization of state licensing laws regarding hotel opening hours. Changes in the causes and distribution of injuries of pedestrians are also noted. 830048. (P-121) European view of the pedestrian accident situation. J. Moreau de Saint Martin, O.N.S.E.R. In 1980 the European Experimental Vehicle Committee set up a working group to study "Pedestrian Injury accidents". The report made by this group which is summarized in this paper gives the importance of pedestrian accidents espe- cially for children and for elderly people, analyzes the in- fluence of the vehicle on injuries and on Kinematics, from which are proposed improvements of cars for injury reduc- tion, proposes criteria for evaluation of pedestrian safety, based on human tolerance and discusses the several meth- ods for simulation of pedestrian accidents. This report con- cludes on priorities for action and several recommendations for future research. Conscious that accidents in which pedestrians are struck by cars constitute one of the principal problems that must be taken into consideration in designing safer vehicles, the European Experimental Vehicles Committee (EEVC) in 1980 set up a Working Group on pedestrian injury acci- dents. This group has completed a report which was pre- sented during the ninth ESV Conference and which is sum- marized in this paper. 830049.

This study, carried out within two years, deals with 441 pedestrians, casualties in traffic accidents, in which the Lyon SAMU intervened on a geographic area correspond- ing to the Lyonese region. This study concerns the lesions according to body sectors, their severity and shows the severity of cephalic lesions. 830050. (P-121) Pedestrian injuries and the downsizing of cars. Robert J. Blodgett, National Highway Traf- fic Safety Administration. The Pedestrian Injury Causation Study (PICS) is used to investigate the relations between car weight and pedestrian injuries in frontal accidents. As car curb weight decreased, large changes in overall severity are not observed, although the proportion of head injuries increases. Since contacts of the windshield area are more common in smaller cars, they are studied in detail. 830051. (P-121) Realization of pedestrian protection measures on cars. Wolfgang Wollert, Joachim Blödorn, Hermann Appel, and Arne Kühnel, In- stitute for Automobile Engineering, Technical University (Berlin). For the first time a working group of German universities developed an efficient, environmentally compatible and safe passenger car. The design of the UNI-CAR was specifically adjusted to the safety of persons outside the vehicle. Thus, for protecting pedestrians and drivers of two-wheeled ve- hicles, several of the bodywork components were primarily developed on the basis of polyurethane integral skin foam to cushion the impact of a person upon the car from outside. For instance, the car was given a reversibly deformable front end and a cushioned bonnet as well as cushioned window frames and roof edges, without impairing the de- sign or aerodynamics of the vehicle. The report explains the aspects of materials selection and vehicle design, the prob- lems and experiences associated with the manufacture and application of these plastics components as well as test re- sults. 830052. (P-121) Feasibility of roadway countermeasures for pedestrian accident experience. Charles V. Zegeer, Goodell-Grivas, Inc. A study was conducted of the feasibility of roadway im- provements as treatments for vehicle pedestrian accidents. Based on a review and analysis of available information, the most promising treatments include one-way street ne- tworks, physical barriers, and nighttime lighting. The use of sign and signal improvements and parking restrictions were also considered feasible in many instances. The use of a comprehensive program of public education, and police en- forcement must complement roadway improvements to help insure more widespread benefits to pedestrian safety. 1983 SAE Transactions 830053. (P-121) Reconstruction of actual car-pedestrian collisions with dummy and cadavers. F. Brun- Cassan, H. Vallee, C. Tarrière, and A. Fayon, Laboratoire de Physiologie et de Biomécanique Peugeot S.A./Renault (France); C. Got and A. Patel, I.R.B.A., Hôpital Raymond Poincaré, Gar- ches, France; and J. Hureau, U.E.R., Faculté de Médecine des Saints-Pères, Paris, France. Car-pedestrian accidents were selected with reference to criteria like relevance in terms of injury severities, represen- tativity and reproducibility, aiming to as accurate as possi- ble reconstructions by dummy and cadaver tests. Parame- ters necessary for performance of these reconstructions were evaluated from the data of accident investigation teams. Preliminary tests were performed by research depart- ments of automobile manufacturers to check the estimated conditions of these accidents before performing their recon- structions. A particular aim was to obtain insights into the mecha- nisms leading to injuries in pedestrian accidents; more gen- erally, reconstructing actual accidents is a privileged ap- proach to determine human tolerance limits and the corresponding protection criteria on dummies; the injuries resulting from the actual accidents are consequently com- pared with the data measured on dummies and cadavers in the reconstruction experiments. Conclusions are also re- lated to the methodology of such reconstructions. 1983 SAE Transactions 830055. (P-121) Experimental investigation of pedestrian head impacts on hoods and fenders of production vehicles. Howard B. Pritz, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, East Liberty, OH. Laboratory experiments were conducted to establish base- line data on pedestrian head impacts onto the hood and fenders of production vehicles. Various vehicles from sub- compact to fullsize were tested using a headform impactor. Pedestrian accident investigation files were used to identify a principal adult head impact area on the hood. Results indicate that the hood, itself, is a good energy absorbing structure but that bottoming frequently occurs on stiff en- gine and body components. It is hypothesized that signifi- cant benefits could be realized in reducing adult pedestrian head injury severity by increasing the clearance between the hood and engine to 2-3 inches in a band approximately 12 inches wide across the width of the vehicle. 1983 SAE Transactions 830056. (P-121) Experimental development of pedestrian head injury tolerance data. Mike Pereira, Trans- portation Research Center of Ohio, East Liberty, OH; and S. J. Ashton, Ohio State Univ., Colum- bus, OH. 28</page><page sequence="10">830056-830062 This paper presents the results of an experimental program in which the head induced damage from real world pedes- trian accidents was reproduced with an impactor. An acci- dent investigation study aimed at obtaining the necessary information for reconstructing pedestrian accidents is dis- cussed. Results of preliminary impact tests in which the mass and velocity of the impactor were varied are presented. Impactor output from reconstructions of the head-induced damage from 24 pedestrian accidents is related to the head injury sustained by the pedestrian in the accident. The paper concludes that it is feasible to use a head form impactor for the development of pedestrian head injury tolerance data. 830057. (P- 121) An analysis of head injuries in real world pedestrian accidents. Thomas A. Greetham and Dennis A. Guenther, The Ohio State Univ., Co- lumbus, OH. Pedestrian injuries are examined using the PICS data file for effects of pedestrian age, vehicle speed, and source of the injury. It is shown that the more severe injuries are caused by contact with the vehicle, and that a stiff structure be- comes increasingly more dangerous, not only as speed in- creases, but as the pedestrian's age increases. 830058. (P-121) Step to step approach to a standardized full scale pedestrian test methodology. Klaus- Peter Glaeser, Bundesanstalt fuer Strassenwesen, Cologne. This report describes the steps to a standardized full scale test methodology, which is needed for the next step, namely the development of a simple and reproducible method to prove the performance of vehicle structures in pedestrian accidents, e.g. by body segment impactor tests. A first pro- ject consisted in a literature study by TNO which gave the main input data for the test method, as e.g. car shapes, standing positions of the pedestrian and impact speeds. Fur- ther on 7 cadaver tests were carried out by ONSER and 24 dummy tests were carried out with a Hybrid II adult dummy and a 6 years old child dummy at the BASt. These tests were the data base for dummy improvements to get a better correspondence in dummy kinematics and loads. In a second project the adult pedestrian dummy was equipped in one case with a HSRI side impact thorax and in the other case with an APR (82) side impact thorax. 16 tests were performed with these dummies which had also modified knee joints allowing a lateral bending of the knees of 30°. The modified knees led to a more realistic bending of the legs around the car shape and to a longer wrap around distance of the dummies. Dummy specific kinematics are described and loads are compared. 830059. (P-121) Mathematical evaluation of the head im- pact risk on a given part of a vehicle, as regards pedestrians. D. Lestrelin, F. Brun-Cassan, A. Fay on, and C. Tarrière, Laboratory of Physiology and Biomechanics - Peugeot S.A./Renault. This paper is related to the pedestrians struck by a vehicle. From the results of multiple runs performed with a previously validated mathematical model, an equation is defined which describes the trajectories of their heads. When the distribution in heights of the pedestrians and the distribution in speeds of the colliding vehicles are taken into account, this equation enables the prediction of the head impact probability for the sundry areas of the front end of the vehicle, according to its profile. 830060. (P-121) MADYMO pedestrian simulations. J. van Wijk, J. Wismans, J. Maltha, and L. Witteb- rood, Research Institute for Road Vehicles TNO, Delft, The Netherlands. In this paper four pedestrian models will be presented: three 2-dimensional models with 2, 5 and 7-segments respectively and one 3-dimensional model with 15 segments. All these models were formulated with the general Crash Victim Simulation package MADYMO. Model results will be com- pared with the experimental results of a Part 572 dummy impacted lateral at two velocities (30 and 40 km/h). The reliability of the models with respect to their complexity will be discussed. Special attention will be given to the mathematical representation of the contact between the pe- destrian and sharp vehicle edges and the visualization of the complex 3-dimensional pedestrian motions with a recently developed 3D-Graphics Package. 830061. The solution of lubrication and coupled analyses using the finite element method. A. C. Stafford and R. D. Henshell, PAFEC Limited; and B. R. Dudley, Nottingham University. Finite element analysis offers the ability to handle, with ease, complex geometrical shapes and abrupt changes in field properties. The established finite element software available within the PAFEC suite of subroutines has been modified and added to so that the laminar hydrodynamic equation for any rigid, isothermal, steadily loaded bearing can be solved. Using the other facilities available, the anal- ysis is extended to handle elastohydrodynamic solutions. In order to analyse flexible bearings, structural analysis is also required. The pressures developed within the oil film form the link between the two types of analysis. This paper presents a summary of the lubrication anal- ysis available using PAFEC. The basic analysis involves specifying the oil film geometry. Iteration is required for analyses involving specified loads. An example of piston ring locus prediction is given to demonstrate this. Results are also detailed in the field of elastohydrodynamic lubrica- tion. 1983 SAE Transactions 830062. Interpretation of engine bearing performance by Journal Orbit Analysis. M. Hollander and K.

This paper is a hand- book for interpretation of calculated journal orbit data and plots. The interpretive techniques presented here apply to any of the Journal Orbit computer programs available. Journal Orbit summary data and plotted output are both discussed in detail. Limits are recommended for sum- mary parameters, and charts are provided to show how typi- cal bearings conform to those limits. Interpretive examples of typical computer plots are also included in the text. 830063. Engine bearing overlays: the effect of overlay composition on diffusion and post-diffusion bear- ing performance. G. C. Pratt and W. J. Whitney, Jr., Federal-Mogul Corp., Engine and Trans- mission Products Group. At engine temperature the loss of tin and copper from the overlay of lead-tin overlay plated crankshaft bearings can result in a corrosion prone overlay and a reduction in bear- ing life. A nickel barrier between the overlay and the lining offers only a partial solution to the problem. New data for the effect on diffusion rate of the original tin and copper contents of lead-tin-copper overlays have been obtained. Interactions between the tin and copper have a major effect on diffusion rate, as do the choice of barrier and its quality. The mechanisms operating during diffusion are illustrated by x-ray maps obtained on the scanning elec- tron microscope. Data for the post-diffusion corrosion and cavitation erosion resistance of overlays have been obtained. The re- sults demonstrate the importance of heat-treatment at en- gine temperature prior to the assessment of overlay per- formance. 830064. Score resistance, hardness and performance of diffused copper-nickel-tin bearings. John C. Bier- lein and Arnold O. DeHart, General Motors Re- search Laboratories, General Motors Corp., War- ren, MI. Current production steel-back, copper-lead bearings con- tain a nickel-barrier layer between the lead-tin babbitt overplate and copper-lead intermediate layer. When these bearings are used in heavy-duty engines, the nickel-barrier layer changes composition via diffusion of tin into the nick- el. When the journal wears through the thin babbitt into the modified nickel-barrier layer, scoring distress occurs. The copper-nickel-tin ternary system was studied. Its liquidus isothermal phase diagram was developed; interme- tallic compounds were located; hardness and score resist- ance maps were generated; and the copper-nickel-lead-tin quaternary composition of actual field bearings as a func- tion of depth through the barrier layer was examined. A new tri-metal, nickel-tin-copper barrier was devel- oped which changes the composition of the barrier to have acceptable score resistance and hardness. An engine test, in which coolant is added to the engine oil until scoring dis- tress occurs, was devised to simulate the distress encoun- tered in service. The new tri-metal barrier bearing outperformed all other materials tested. 1983 SAE Transactions 830065. Dynamic analysis of engine bearing systems. W. A. Welsh and J. F. Booker, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Cornell University, Ith- aca, NY. The "finite element method" of structural analysis and the "mobility method" of bearing analysis are combined for the computation of main bearing load and displacement cycles (together with such secondary performance variables as film thickness and shaft stress). A numerical example for a production engine illus- trates problem-dependent discrepancies between results of present and previous computation methods. 830066. Piston slap motion and engine noise under low temperature idling operation of diesel engines. Shoichi Furuhama and Koji Hirukawa, Musashi Institute of Technology. Diesel engines make a shrill noise called "idle knock" under low temperature idling operation. This causes a serious noise pollution problem in automobile diesel engines. It was clarified by this study that one important source of this noise was piston slap impulse. Piston slap motion was measured under usual operating conditions and a condition with additional oil supplied into the piston clearance. The piston slap motion was calculated, taking into account the frictional resistances of the crank mechanism and squeeze action of oil film. It was concluded that only a negligible amount of oil existed in the piston clearance for the squeeze action. 1983 SAE Transactions 830067. Fuel economy - its influence on diesel piston de- sign features. Robert Munro, Wellworthy Lim- ited. The piston has a major role to play in the many aspects of fuel economy development being undertaken in the diesel engine industry. Relative to this work a range of piston features are discussed and several new ideas for improved performance introduced. Some of these features include combustion bowl reinforcement, high top rings, crown in- sulation and skirt friction. The squeeze casting process is shown to offer potential for improved strength and new design concepts and a novel relieved area low friction skirt configuration is presented. 830068. Measurement of oil-film-thickness between pis- ton ring and cylinder. Keiichiro Shin and Yukio Tateishi, Technical Div., Nippon Piston Ring Co., Ltd.; and Shoichi Furuhama, Musashi Insti- tute of Technology. 30</page><page sequence="12">830068 - 830074 For continuous measurement of oil-film-thickness on the piston ring, an electrical capacitance method has been ap- plied. The capacitance pick-up fixed in the ring had an elec- trode with or without an insulating surface layer. We also measured friction forces at the same time, and learned the following. (1) If oil is supplied adequately, oil-film-thickness agrees with the theoretical value. Friction force, however, was 2 or 2.5 times greater than the theoretical value. (2) Oil-film-thickness on the top ring of the actual en- gine is considerably smaller than the theoretical value. This is considered attributable to inadequate oil supply (starva- tion). (3) The piston ring sliding surface is not always parallel to the cylinder wall. This phenomenon has a major influence on the formation of partial oil-film-thickness. 1983 SAE Transactions 830069. Silicon carbide reduces bore wear. John E. Tan- ner, Laystall Engineering Co. Ltd. The evolution, development, application and future of a new surface treatment for piston rings and cylinder liners. The treatment has evolved over the last 20 years. It consists of the impregnation of the wearing surfaces with pure sili- con carbide. The research background demonstrates that the material is bonded intimately. The process can be ap- plied to liners and rings in a variety of basic materials. The application is to any mechanism where the physics of rub- bing surfaces cause wear problems. The process is protected by patents in the main automobile producing countries in the world. 830070. Designing automotive fuel systems in high tem- perature plastics. Kenneth W. Nelson, Du Pont Company. The use of high temperature engineering plastics in automo- tive fuel systems offer significant cost savings for vehicle manufacturers. These engineering plastics, which are avail- able in many different resin compositions, offer such impor- tant underhood properties as heat and chemical resistance, low warpage, dimensional stability, toughness and strength. They also provide processing benefits that can substan- tially reduce capital costs. The expensive finishing steps inherent with die-cast alloys are reduced or even eliminated with plastics. Additional economies are derived from the greater design flexibility and ease of assembly that plastics offer. 830071. A new approach to glass fiber reinforced high heat thermoplastics. David M. Hall, Monsanto Co. This paper presents the properties of glass-reinforced high- heat ABS/SMA-terpolymer alloys offering cost-effective al- ternates to reinforced polyesters in automotive applications. It also discusses a unique new approach to the design, pro- totyping, and raw material selection phases of developing a new product. This approach, based on the terpolymer alloy in combination with a collimated glass concentrate polymerized in SAN, enables the design engineer to empiri- cally establish the optimum glass level for his application using these data as a starting point. The "custom" product thus established can then be supplied on a routine basis. 830072. Improving quality and performance of automo- tive rubber parts. Stavros Kyriakides, Chem-Pro Manufacturing Co., Inc. A new chemical composition for the protection of vulcan- ized rubber products has been developed, and its effective- ness has been proven in a number of natural and synthetic rubber products. The new product is based on the surface chemistry of polymers, whereby, a high concentration of an effective system is introduced into the surface of the rubber for its protection against deterioration caused by weather- ing and ozone attack. Ozone cracking, ozidation, flex crack- ing and flex fatigue are controlled by chemically treating the surface of rubber. The system provides resistance to ozone attack and an effective singlet oxygen quencher that prevents polymer degradation. The product provides a sim- ple and cost effective method to extend the service life of new and in-service products, and improves their perform- ance. The new concept makes possible the use of low cost elastomers for applications demanding superior resistance to ozone. 830073. Thermal and solar effects on vehicle components. Ward J. Atkinson and Douglas W. Johansen, Sun Test Engineering. Solar radiation causes plastic parts to fail prematurely. A survey of vehicles in the Southwest United States indicates which parts do not live in the "real world" environment. Static and dynamic tests were conducted to determine the solar and thermal loads on these components. The test re- sults presented show the solar impact on the plastic compo- nents in the "real world" environment. 830074. Apparent interlaminar shear strength of epoxy and vinyl ester composites. Golam M. Newaz, Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. The interlaminar shear strength characteristics of unidirec- tional E-glass fiber/epoxy and vinyl ester composites were investigated. The short-beam flexure test (ASTM D-2344) was utilized for comparing the performance characteristics of the two systems. It was found that E-glass fiber/epoxy composite has higher interlaminar shear strength compared to the vinyl ester composite in dry condition. However, for short-term hygrothermal condition, the retained shear strength values were nearly the same. Optical photomicrog- raphy revealed that interlaminar shear damage primarily consisted of fiber-matrix interfacial debonding and matrix cracking. Voids were found to have adverse effect on inter- laminar shear strength. The influence of voids was studied in relation to mode II crack or damage propagation. 31</page><page sequence="13">830076-830081 830076. Field performance of major automotive compo- nents made of nylon. H. Harris Goodman, Du Pont Co. Nylon automotive parts, representing all major areas of the car, were evaluated for field performance after a service life ranging from 2 to 10 years in regular production vehicles. Parts covering nine applications were checked for appear- ance, relative viscosity, tensile strength and elongation. Re- sults indicate that all parts retained good resin quality, even after years of exposure to the harsh under-hood environ- ment of high heat and thrown gravel and the corrosive action of automotive fluids, gasoline vapor and road salt. Although a dimensional check was conducted on only four of the nine applications, the readings indicate good toler- ance retention. 830077. Blow molded reinforced high density polyethyl- ene for structural applications. D. L. Peters, R. C. Kowalski, and J. K. Hughes, Phillips Petro- leum Co. The first reinforced high density polyethylene blow molding compound with engineering properties has been developed by Phillips Chemical Company in a two-year joint program with Fisher Body Division of General Motors and Ford Motor Company. Chemically coupled mica, compounded with a Marlex® high molecular weight high density poly- ethylene copolymer, results in a material having dramati- cally improved stiffness at both room temperature and ele- vated (180°F) temperatures. The high rigidity of this material has allowed reduced piece weight and significant cost savings in three automo- tive seat back panel and load floor applications. A full width seat back weighing about half of a metal frame is now being used in the Chevrolet Camaro, Chevrolet Z28 and Pontiac Firebird. A split seat back version is standard in the Pontiac Trans Am. Ford has realized impressive cost sav- ings using a large mica reinforced high density polyethylene load floor in their Escort EXP and Lynx LN7 cars. The success of these blow molded applications has spawned promising development work in thermoforming and sheet compression molding processes. 830078. Optimized regeneration conditions of ceramic honeycomb diesel particulate filters. Noboru Hi- guchi, Shigeru Mochida, and Masaru Kojima, NGK Insulators, Ltd. Ceramic honeycomb filters performing diesel particulate trapping require regeneration by burning the subsequently accumulated particulate. During this regeneration, thermal failure occurs in some conditions. For developing a highly reliable system with this me- thod, it is necessary to clarify the effects of various factors on the failure to optimize the regeneration conditions. This paper gives the results of an experiment, employ- ing a burner method, of the effect on the damage of regener- ation conditions of gas temperature, oxygen concentration, gas flow rate and amount of accumulated particulate, and discusses the regeneration conditions under which the filter is safely operated. 1 983 SAE Transactions 830079. Thermal stresses in ceramic wall flow diesel fil- ters. Suresh T. Gulati, Research &amp; Development Labs, Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY. Thermal stresses constitute a major portion of the total stress which the ceramic wall flow filter experiences in service. The primary source of these stresses is the tempera- ture gradients, both in radial and axial directions, which attain their maximum values during regeneration. The level of particulate loading, the flow rate, the filter size and the mounting design govern the severity of temperature gra- dients which, together with physical properties and aspect ratio of the filter, dictate the magnitude and distribution of thermal stresses. The filter, the mounting, and the regenera- tion conditions should be so designed as to minimize these stresses to insure reliable and fracture-free performance of the filter throughout the lifetime of the vehicle. In this paper we present a thermal stress model, based on finite element method, which computes stresses in the axisymmetric filter subjected to linear or step temperature gradients in radial and axial directions. The model is useful for assessing the effects of aspect ratio and expansion ani- sotropy, both of which play a key role in filter design, and is illustrated by way of examples taken from simulated re- generation conditions. The importance of thermal fatigue in this application is also discussed. 1983 SAE Transactions 830080. Catalytic diesel particulate control system design and operation. Miles F. Buchman and Bernard E. Enga, Johnson Matthey Inc. Catalytic trap oxidizers developed for use in control of par- ticulate emissions from diesel engines have been advanced to the vehicle installation stage. This paper discusses the development of complete vehicle systems. Methods and techniques of assisted regeneration are presented along with control system concepts. Installation of the trap unit as part of an integrated vehicle exhaust system is described, along with designs and results from various prototype builds. 1983 SAE Transactions 830081. Catalytically activated diesel exhaust filters - en- gine test methods and results. E. Koberstein, H.-D. Pletka, and H. Völker, Degussa AG, ZN Wolfgang. An engine test unit for the evaluation of Diesel exhaust filters with analytical equipment to measure particulates, oxygen, hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, nitrogenoxides concentrations, temperature and pressure trends is de- scribed as well as the test procedures presently applied. 32</page><page sequence="14">830081 - 830086 Engine test results with different types of Diesel partic- ulate filters - non activated and catalytically activated - up to 400 hrs. operation time are presented. With base metal catalysts, reductions in "soof'-ignition temperatures of about 100°C could be attained under optimal conditions. A correlation between oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas and the "soot"-ignition temperature is demonstrated. Com- bined catalytic systems (precious metal and base metal cata- lysts) permitted hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide conver- sions up to 90% - including a decrease in odour intensity - in addition to particulate reduction. 830082. "Trapless" Trap - a catalytic combustion system of diesel particulates using ceramic foam. Yoji Watabe, Koichi Irako, Toshiyuki Miyajima, and Toshio Yoshimoto, Bridgestone Tire Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan; and Yuichi Murakami, Dept. of Synthetic Chemistry, Nagoya University, Na- goya, Japan. "Trapless" Trap, which makes possible the effective col- lecting of particulates in diesel exhaust gas and their simul- taneous combustion has been developed by use of a ceramic foam in combination with catalysts containing copper salt. From a TEM photograph, it was observed that the particu- late was rapidly oxidized by mobile copper ion, showing worm-eaten like spots. Screening of various base metal salts by TGA presented CuC12-KC1-NH4V03 and CuCl2-KCl-(NH4)6Mo7024 as very active catalysts for diesel particulate oxidation. They had thermal stability up to 900°C when they were supported on titania. The results obtained by measuring the back pressure using 1.8L diesel engine suggest the above trap to be a self-cleaning trapless trap. 1 983 SAE Transactions 830083. Thermal and catalytic regeneration of diesel par- ticulate traps. W. R. Wade, J. E. White, J. J. Florek, and H. A. Cikánek, Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. Thermal and catalytic techniques for regenerating particu- late traps were assessed. The thermal technique used a burner which heated engine exhaust to the ignition temper- ature of the particulates to achieve over 90% regeneration effectiveness. HC, CO and particulate emissions resulting from combustion of particulates and burner exhaust were 25 to 50% of the allowable vehicle emissions for one CVS cycle. The fuel consumed by the burner was 9% of the fuel consumed by a vehicle over one CVS cycle. Problems with burner nozzle clogging, ignition reliability, trap durability and control system requirements were identified. In the catalytic technique, Diesel fuel containing .5 gm/gal lead and .25 gm/gal copper lowered the ignition temperature of the particulates by 425°F so that periodic regeneration oc- curred. The trap collected nearly all of the lead and copper resulting in limited trap life, and deposits on the engine fuel nozzles tended to increase HC emissions. 1983 SAE Transactions 830084. Diesel car particulate control methods. Charles M. Urban, Southwest Research Institute, San An- tonio, TX; and Larry C. Landman and Robert D. Wagner, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Ann Arbor, MI. Methods for particulate (and associated organics) emissions control were evaluated in several diesel cars. Of the meth- ods investigated, only "particulate traps" provided large reductions in particulate emissions. Traps evaluated in- cluded metal mesh and ceramic monolithic configurations, catalyzed and uncatalyzed. One of the cars, with a ceramic trap installed, completed fifty thousand miles of distance accumulation. No significant deterioration of emissions oc- curred over those fifty thousand miles. 1983 SAE Transactions 830085. Diesel exhaust particulate control system devel- opment. Otto A. Ludecke and David L. Dimick, Advanced Product Engineering, Advanced Prod- uct &amp; Manufacturing Engineering Staff, General Motors Corporation. The EPA has established stringent requirements for levels of particulates emitted from the exhaust of diesel passenger cars. This paper summarizes six years of development activi- ties directed towards reduction of diesel passenger car par- ticulates. A series of conceptual approaches have been ex- perimentally evaluated, leading to development of a regenerative particulate trap. Alternate trapping material investigations, regeneration systems, and total trap systems are reviewed. The current status of this development and required technical needs are identified. 1983 SAE Transactions 830086. Regeneration of particulate filters at low temper- atures. B. Wiedemann, U. Doerges, W. Engeler, and B. Poettner, Volkswagenwerk AG, Wolfs- burg. Due to good trapping abilities, the ceramic trap filter was chosen for the reduction of the particulate emission of Die- sel engines. Both, tests and the analysis of the regeneration kinetic show that in real-world application the lite-off limit of 500°C may not be exceeded. The minimum exhaust gas temperature necessary for regeneration without the use of a catlyst, can be reduced to approx. 200°C to 250°C with the use of fuel additives. The use of additives for the filter regeneration showed excellent results in real-world conditions as well as with endurance tests. There was no significant change in emissions or spe- cific fuel consumption about 20,000 km as compared to the operation without additives. 33</page><page sequence="15">830086-830091 The regeneration dependability however, is question- able because of the destruction of the filter. This destruction is caused by exceeding the melting point of the ceramic by thermal reactions due to erratic regeneration and by thermal reactions due to a high temperature increase rate after ex- ceeding the lite-off limit. For the increase of the service life of the trap, a ceramic material with a lower thermal expansion coefficient is re- quired. The start of regeneration can be achieved simultane- ously by significantly exceeding the lite-off limit. Finally, with the control of the amount of oxygen in the exhaust gas (i.e. with EGR), it is possible to avoid exceeding the melting point of the ceramic. 1983 SAE Transactions 830087. Particulate control systems for diesel engines us- ing catalytically coated and uncoated traps with consideration of regeneration techniques. Polat Öser and Ulrich Thorns, Volkswagenwerk AG. Basic investigations of the particulate control system proj- ects for VW and Audi diesel engines are summarized. A screening test procedure to evaluate the particulate con- cepts is developed and the significant assessment criteria are defined. The storage and regeneration characteristics as well as balance temperatures, introduced with this paper, are applied to various uncoated and catalytically coated filters. This paper discusses also the parameter studies for uncoated filters. A survey of regeneration techniques and individual regeneration methods is given with energy consideration and fuel consumption effects. After establishing the current stage, the priorities for further technical development work are set and the problem areas throughout the particulate control field are demonstrated. Cost-benefit in applicability for production use is con- sidered. 1 983 SAE Transactions 830088. On the theory of orthogonal engine mount system and its application to motorcycles. Tetsuya Seino, Masao Furusawa, and Hiroyuki Ikuma, Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd. By orthogonalizing the primary inertia moment vector pro- duced by an engine with many eigen vectors, a new engine mounting method called "the orthogonal engine mount system" was designed. This paper explains its theoretical background. In ad- dition, a motorcycle with a two-cylinder engine incorpora- ting this system was analyzed by means of modal analysis and building block approach techniques to determine the effectiveness of the orthogonal engine mount system. 830089. A very small (1.6 CID) DI diesel engine. G. W. Schweimer and T. Bader, Research Division, Volkswagenwerk AG, Federal Republic of Ger- many. A fuel economy of 3,508 mpg was achieved at an average velocity of 10.5 mph with a specially-designed three- wheeled vehicle powered by a one-cylinder DI Diesel en- gine, the characteristics of which are as follows: Bore/stroke - 32/32 mm Displacement - 25.7 cm3 Compression ratio - 20:1 Torque - 0.8 Nm Speed range - 1500-3000 rpm Power output - 200 W Fuel consumption - 450 g/kWh Injection pump - 5-mm plunger Nozzle - 4 50-fim holes Injection pressure - 350 bar Fuel delivery - 0.5-1.2 mg/stroke Injection timing - Fixed Swirl generation - Deflector on inlet v.

Development of HLA for high speed motorcycle engine. Yoshikatsu Nakano, Saburo Matsuoka, and Masaaki Matsuura, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd., Asaka Center. In order to improve maintenance free operation of the mo- torcycle engine with DOHC-16 valves In-Line 4 cylinders design by decreasing the labor and cost involved in valve lash adjustment, it has become necessary to develop a Hy- draulic Lash Adjuster (HLA) which is compact in design and has a thoroughly high speed valve motion at more than 10,000rpm. This paper describes the process of developing a com- pact HLA. For instance, the lack of the rigidity of the HLA itself was solved by the extensive analysis of the engine valve motion as well as the behavior of the HLA. As a result, an HLA system with compact design and high speed capability of the engine valve motion has been developed. In addition, it operates better than a mechanical lash adjuster in idling stability, cold startability, warm-up capability and somewhat in engine power, and also it oper- ates more quietly. 830091. A study of irregular combustion in 2-stroke cycle gasoline engines. Katsuhiko Tsuchiya, Yoshiro Nagai, and Tohru Gotoh, Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd. In general, two-stroke engines have a tendency to develop irregular combustion under light load. Under this condi- tion, two-cycle motorcycles have inferior riding qualities. This paper discusses the operating conditions of the engine under which irregular combustion takes place. To analyze irregular combustion, the gas scavenging process is simu- 34</page><page sequence="16">830091-830099 lated and the adiabatic flame temperature is introduced as a criteria. Auto ignition, which is apt to occur under light load and high speed, is also investigated and is discussed in association with gas temperature and adiabatic flame tem- perature at the moment of ignition. 1 983 SAE Transactions 830092. Flattening the torque curve of a two-stroke en- gine with a fluid diode installed at the scavenge port. Eran Sher and Haim Yafe, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Ben-Gurion University, Beer-Sheva, Israel. The typical convex torque of a simple two-stroke engine having a port-controlled piston is attributed to the backflow through the scavenge ports. It is proposed here to suppress the backflow by installing scroll diodes at the scavenge ports. Experimental observations on a fired engine demon- strate the remarkable improvement achieved with the diodes installed. The effect of the diodes presence on the engine power and on the delivery ratio is discussed by using a recorded diagram of the crankcase pressure variation with crank-angle during the gas exchange process. 830093. Reduction of fuel consumption of a spark-ignition two-stroke cycle engine. G. P. Blair, B. W. Hill, A. J. Miller, and S. P. Nickell, Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, The Queen's University of Belfast, Northern Ireland. The paper describes and lists the performance characteris- tics of a 400 cm3 single-cylinder two-stroke cycle engine with natural-aspiration, spark-ignition and carburetor con- trol of gasoline fuel. The engine features an uncomplicated and unique system of stratified-charging which helps reduce the short-circuited loss of fuel during scavenging. With an untuned exhaust system the engine produces a peak power of 13 kW at 5500 rev/min and a brake specific fuel con- sumption which has a minimum of 0.265 kgAWh but, more importantly, virtually the entire speed and load range is below 0.34 kgAWh (0.55 lb/hp. hr). All performance characteristics at several throttle openings are presented at various engine speeds as a function of air/fuel ratio. 1983 SAE Transactions 830094. The all-aluminum auto body - a study based on the Porsche 928. Hermann E. Burst, Hans-Peter Bäuerle, and Wolfram F. Thull, Research and Development Center, Porsche AG. An all-aluminum body in a unitized construction of a sportscar has been developed as a prototype. Design fea- tures, forming, welding, and surface treatment have been studied as well as the results of the test trials. A weight- saving of 47% compared to an all-steel body was achieved with good characteristics of static and dynamic stiffness, operational reliability, passive safety properties, corrosion resistance, noise level, and repairability. 830096. An optimized aluminum alloy (X6111) for auto body sheet applications. P. E. Fortin, M. J. Bull, and D. M. Moore, Alean International Limited, Kingston Laboratories. The influence on properties of various alloying elements in the principal aluminum alloys used for external auto body components has been studied and from the results an alloy with improved characteristics has been devised. The proper- ties evaluated were strength, formability, age-hardening re- sponse and corrosion resistance. The fabrication practices were also examined and the best procedures to maximize properties were developed. The alloy has been formulated to provide the necessary formability requirements encountered in the production of body panels, while still obtaining a high yield strength after paint bake for good denting resistance. The result is a sheet alloy with slightly reduced yield strength but better forma- bility and less susceptibility to spring back than 2036, 2038 and 6010 in the T4 temper and with an excellent response to paint bake treatments. The corrosion resistance of the new alloy is superior to that of 2036 and 2038 and is com- parable to that of 6009 and 6010. 830097. Cold-drawn precision aluminum tubing for auto- motive hydraulic system applications. Richard Knoll, Jr., Norsk Hydro Aluminum, Inc., Rock- ledge, FL; John A. Aamodt, Norsk Hydro a.s, Oslo, Norway; and Gunnar Gjertsen, Norsk Hydro Karm0y Fabrikker, Haavik, Norway. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the development work of "HYDALEX", a cold-drawn aluminum precision tube, which meets all criteria outlined in the material speci- fications of SAE, ASTM and DIN for automotive hydraulic system applications. 830099. Recycling of automotive aluminum - present and future. C. Norman Cochran, Ronald H. G. McClure, and Joseph J. Tribendis, Aluminum Company of America. About 70% of the 740 million pounds of aluminum in U.S. cars scrapped in 1982 will be recovered for the secondary aluminum industry, making cars second only to used bever- age containers as a source of old aluminum scrap. By the late 1990's aluminum could supersede ferrous materials as the component with the highest total scrap value in the car. To fully realize this value, the automotive scrap industry will probably move from methods primarily designed to recover ferrous values toward practices which decrease the mixing of materials that presently limits recovery and value for aluminum. Today's system for recycle of used aluminum beverage cans could foreshadow development of a means for recy- cling automotive aluminum back to primary aluminum pro- ducers. This could be accomplished by increasing disman- tling and by identification and segregation of aluminum components by alloy. Aluminum intense structures of the 35</page><page sequence="17">830099 - 830106 future could be stripped of non-aluminum components and shredded separately or baled. 1983 SAE Transactions 830100. Smart sensors. W. G. Wolber, Cummins Engine Co., Inc., Columbus, IN. Microcomputer-organized engine controls for passenger cars are now an established fact. The sensors for these con- trols are still rather crude, and will be challenged during the 1980's by more advanced designs incorporating sophisti- cated electronics. The author describes the advantages for the control system, and for the sensor itself, which can be realized when a sensor is "smart" - designed from its inception to incorporate a dedicated real-time microcom- puter. The increasing availability and use of such smart sensors is predicted. 1983 SAE Transactions 830101. Sensor and actuator requirements for heavy duty diesels. J. W. Austin, Cummins Engine Com- pany, Inc. The current trend from hydromechanical to computer based engine controls is creating the need for high produc- tion volume, low cost, electronic sensors and actuators. These components must match the reliability and durability of the engine to which they are mounted. This paper out- lines the heavy duty diesel engine environment and uses the development of a throttle position sensor as an example of the unique specifications required for some components. 1983 SAE Transactions 830102. Nonintrusive acoustic system for the dynamic timing of diesel engines. Randall C. Davis, David L. Hagen, Huel C. Scherrer, and David B. Kittel- son, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN; and Erwin D. Lowell, and Allyn G. Tidball, Owatonna Tool Co., Owatonna, MN. Vibration signals from diesel engines were analyzed for the purpose of isolating signals relating to injection or com- bustion which could be used to time the engines. Nonin- trusive sensors, magnetically attached to the engine, were used to obtain these vibration signals. Components believed to be associated with combustion or fuel injection were electronically isolated from the remaining engine noise, and subsequently processed to produce specific timing signals. Digital data acquisition and averaging methods were used, coupled with computerized frequency analysis. The signals were experimentally correlated with the combustion process over a wide range of injection timing. The electronic proc- essing system developed provides a real time digital meas- ure of the timing. Data on the accuracy and correlation of experimental measurements will be presented. 1983 SAE Transactions 830103. A new load sensor for truck self weighing sys- tems. J. David Barnett and R. West, T.R.W. Probe Electronics Co. Ltd. The need to measure axle loads, payload and gross load of commercial vehicles is shown to have led to the develop- ment of the technique of indirect measurement of load by siting strain sensors on the load bearing components of trucks. The specification for a suitable sensor is offered and some of the different types of sensor that have attempted to meet it are examined. An evolutionary design route is traced for a new type of sensor which is low cost, easy to apply and comes close to the specification. The sensor is described together with its protective housing and tooling system which is an important part of the assembly. Finally the likely direction that future market needs will take the development of the sensor and its built in electronics is reviewed. 830105. Automotive thick film temperature sensors. Ber- nard Montaron, Renix Electronique SA, Tou- louse, France. A fast response, thick film nickel temperature sensing ele- ment has been developed for use with automotive electronic systems. The same basic sensing element can be custom de- signed and packaged for sensing engine inlet air tempera- ture, engine coolant temperature, engine oil temperature, and others. Different physical designs can be adapted to a given application taking into account such factors as accuracy, response time, mechanical shock, chemical effects, and du- rability. 1983 SAE Transactions 830106. An advanced electrothermal sensor for automo- tive level measurement. M. Haub, R.-H. Jakobs, and F. Kuehnel, VDO Adolf Schindling AG, Schwalbach, Germany. This paper describes a fuel level sensor, which basically consists of thin-film resistors encapsulated in Kapton foils. The thin-film elements are heated by constant current pul- ses and the immersed part is cooled by the liquid to be measured. This results in a change in resistance which can be detected by various types of evaluation circuitry dis- cussed in the paper. This electrothermal principle has a number of advantages compared to conventional methods: - long life due to absence of mechanical moving parts or contacts - high media compatibility including ethanol or metha- nol containing fuels - high resolution in the "empty region" - easy shaping of output characteristics with unusual tank shapes A status report on development progress is given in- cluding test results with first prototypes and a discussion of 36</page><page sequence="18">830106-830112 the achieved error-band. 1983 SAE Transactions 830108. High reliability absolute semiconductor pressure sensor. M. Bessho, Y. Tsuru, H. Horiike, M. Jin- mon, K. Yamagami, and S. Wataya, Mitsubishi Electric Corp. This paper describes an absolute semiconductor pressure sensor suitable for the engine control systems in automo- biles. Using the passive (electrically nonconnected) side of a sensor chip as the pressure interface, it has good pressure media compatibility. But it requires a pedestal with a pressure inlet hole and a larger contact area for good sealed, vacuum reference, since the larger contact area causes a larger temperature shift of the offset voltage due to thermal stress. We have analyzed the thermal stress by the finite element method and have designed a lower, tubular ped- estal with a groove which has isolated the sensor chip from the thermal stress more effectively. As a result, the sensor chip has been assembled in a standard TO-5 package and a temperature shift of the offset voltage within ± 1 % error of FS (Full Scale) without tem- perature compensation in the temperature range of -30°C to 100°C has been realized. 830109. Electric vehicle for nickel zinc battery testing. Ronald R. Smisek and Lawrence C. Marsh, Cur- rent Engineering and Manufacturing, Services Staff, General Motors Corp. This paper describes the vehicle and propulsion system mechanization selected by General Motors to assess the progress being made in the area of Nickel Zinc battery development. Towards this end a fleet of 12 road vehicles have been fabricated and have contributed significantly to the accumulation of 200,000 test miles on Nickel Zinc powered electric vehicles. The drivetrain selected for these vehicles includes a separately excited DC motor, an SCR armature chopper, a transistorized bi-directional field chopper and a low level electronic control system based on General Motor's Cus- tom Microprocessor chip set. This fleet of test vehicles does not represent production intent but does possess many of the attributes thought to be necessary for a commercially viable Electric Vehicle. Although GM's Electric Car development activities have been reduced in recent months, GM is maintaining a level of battery development that will provide the Corpora- tion with sufficient flexibility to respond to future energy supply uncertainties. Consequently, these battery test ve- hicles will continue to play an important role in battery development and test. 830110. Electric vehicle road tests of Ni-Zn batteries. E. H. Hietbrink, General Motors Research Labora- tories, Warren, MI; R. W. Boak, General Motors Current Engineering and Manufacturing Services Staff, Warren, MI; and L. P. Atkins, Delco-Remy Division, General Motors Corp., Anderson, IN. This paper describes an on-the-road Electric Vehicle test program that was conducted at the General Motors Prov- ing Ground to assess the performance and durability of a Ni-Zn battery system in a vehicle environment. Vehicle driving schedules, and the results of battery pack service and cycle life under various conditions are emphasized. A general description of the Ni-Zn cell design and the installa- tion of the battery pack in the test vehicle is included. 1983 SAE Transactions 830111. Permanent magnet AC disc motor electric vehicle drive. Gerald B. Kliman, General Electric Co., Corporate Research &amp; Development, Schenec- tady, NY. The principal objective of this work was to establish the feasibility of the axial flux permanent magnet ac disc motor with load-commutated inverter as a candidate for an elec- tric passenger vehicle drive system component. Three motors were built in the course of the project. The first, known as the proof-of-principal (POP) motor, was built to demonstrate the electromagnetic concepts and establish design data. It was built with rare earth magnets and a dc motor type random winding. The second motor, known as the Functional Model A [FM(A)J motor, was built for full performance and high speed (11,000 rpm). Alnico 8E magnets were used to stimulate manganese- aluminum. A three-layer air gap winding was used in the stator. This motor did not perform as predicted due primar- ily to demagnetization of the magnets and, secondarily, to imbalance in the windings. The third motor, known as Functional Model B [FM(B)], corrected these problems by use of rare earth magnets and a novel, single-layer chain winding. The motor performed well and in excess of con- tract requirements electromagnetically, thermally, and me- chanically. A peak efficiency of 93% was measured at cy- cling power when the motor was being driven by the inverter. Several modifications were proposed to raise the efficiency to 95%. 1983 SAE Transactions 830112. Elastomeric regenerative braking systems. L. O. Hoppie, Corporate Research Dept., Eaton Engi- neering and Research Center, Southfield, MI. A theoretical and experimental investigation into the use of elastomers as the energy storage element of a regenerative braking system for urban vehicles is being carried out. This work has included the design and fabrication of full-scale elastomeric energy storage units which were tested to in- vestigate energy density, efficiency and stress-relaxation. A complete small-scale system which simulates a vehicle was tested during transient speed conditions, and a complete full-scale system to be laboratory tested is under construc- tion. 1983 SAE Transactions 37</page><page sequence="19">830113-830122 830113. The Lucas hybrid electric car. G. G. Harding, B. L. Phillips, and J. E. Hammond, Lucas Chloride EV Systems Limited, Birmingham, England. A five-passenger prototype car has been built to demon- strate and develop the hybrid drive concept. It uses a bat- tery electric drive system similar to that already used on 1 -tonne pay load vans, together with an IC engine and gen- erator enabling operation in both series and parallel modes. With a projected range of some 40 miles (64 kilometres) in urban traffic in battery-only mode, the car has been de- signed to have traffic compatible performance and the abil- ity to cruise on highways indefinitely using the engine, with additional power available from the electric motor if required. 830115. Development of a 4-seater electric van with a regenerative braking system. G. J. Hwang, De- partment of Power Mechanical Engineering, Na- tional Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, Republic of China. An advanced 4-seater electric van named TEEV-8XA was developed at Tang Eng Iron Work Company to evaluate the engineering feasibilities of a unibody construction of the van and an electronic controller with a regenerative braking circuit for a DC series-wound motor. The unibody construction and trim of the van body save a weight of about 45 Kg as compared with the original construction. A two-current-level control logic is employed for the speed control of the vehicle. During the braking period, the chopper for motoring switches to the chopper for field excitation, the motor becomes a generator, and one additional chopper and an inductor are used to step-up the generator voltage. Road tests were taken and it is found that about 15.3% of the input electric energy is recharged to the batteries. 830116. An analysis and comparison of automotive pro- pulsion systems. Ervin Behrin, Lawrence Liver- more National Laboratory, Livermore, CA. We analyze a number of existing and proposed automotive propulsion systems and compare their specific energy and specific peak power in terms of mechanical energy delivered from the propulsion system's energy-conversion device. The calculations account for losses due to the energy-conversion process and include the masses of both the fuel (or energy- storage device) and the energy-conversion components. Va- lues used in the comparisons range from the current state of the art, or most-probable forecasts of characteristics, to highly optimistic projections of device characteristics. On the basis of this analysis, we estimate the range and acceler- ation for passenger vehicles utilizing the various propulsion systems. We also examine power-boosted hybrid systems. 1983 SAE Transactions 830117. Progress in instrumental analysis of exhaust odorants. H. L. Daudel, M. J. Fieber, and H. O. Hardenberg, Daimler-Benz AG (Stuttgart, Ger- many). Odorants from the exhaust gas of combustion engines can be determined qualitatively and quantitatively by means of two-dimensional gas chromatographic separation, using human sense of smell, a flame ionization detector and a mass spectrometer as detectors. Maintaining certain test conditions is the deciding fac- tor for the success of such investigations. Considerable pro- gress was made with regard to complete, reproducible anal- yses of organic exhaust components after the test equipment and procedure had been modified, and after the optimal conditions for adsorption, desorption and substance trans- fer into the analytical equipment had been established. 830120. Effect of Japanese legal control of vehicle ex- hausts on photochemical smog control. Fumitake Chisaka, Automobile Div., MEL Gakuen, Ibara- ki, Japan. Japanese legal control of HC and NOx emissions from mo- tor vehicles have a sufficient effect on controlling photo- chemical smog in HC-NOx reaction system. This thing was obtained through numerical simulations in effect equivalent to dynamic smog chamber tests using a simplified box model consisting of a reaction module and some environ- mental factors. Concerning the dilution capacity of R=100 %/h, if the emission flux of NOx is controlled so as not to exceed 0.058 tonAm3h, the maximum concentrations of 03 and N02 can be lowered to 0.10 and 0.023 ppm. Moreover, simultaneous control of both the HC and NOx so as not exceed 0.58 and 0.27 tonAm3h respectively, is predicated upon meeting both the Japanese 03 and NOx air quality standards. It turns out that this control admits ample traffic volume 6100 cars Am2, and is a considerably more cost- effective strategy. 830122. Laboratory and on-highway testing of diesel or- ganic Rankine compound long-haul vehicle en- gine. Francis A. DiBella, Luco R. DiNanno, and Michael D. Koplow, Thermo Electron Corp. An Organic Rankine-Cycle System (ORCS) designed for use with a 288-Bhp, Class 8, Long-Haul Vehicle Diesel Engine has undergone both laboratory endurance- performance testing and actual on-highway fuel economy comparison testing. Two, 1000-hour endurance tests have been conducted to demonstrate the functional integrity of the basic ORCS design and reveal any "infant mortality" problems with individual components. On highway vehicle fuel economy tests demonstrated a statistical average of 12%-percent improvement in fuel consumption. Such tests have been conducted in a project sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy as part of their long- term national goals of improving the fuel consumption in energy-intensive industries, such as, but not restricted to, 38</page><page sequence="20">830122-830127 the U.S. Trucking Industry. Approximately 100,000 barrels of oil per day are expected to be saved with the full imple- mentation of a Diesel Organic Rankine-Cycle Compound Engine in the U.S. Trucking Industry. A brief description of the basic ORCS components in- cluding the advanced microprocessor-based control system is included. The results of the laboratory endurance- performance and the on-highway vehicle tests will be given. A short discussion of the future work required in ad- vancing the development of a commercial ORCS for long- haul vehicles is also given. 830123. Characteristics of fuel economy and output in methanol fueled turbocharged S.I. engine. Y. Ta- kagi, Y. Nakajima, S. Muranaka, and K. Ohka- wa, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., Yokosuka, Japan. One outstanding feature of methanol as an alternative fuel for spark ignition engines is its very high antiknock charac- teristics. In this study, potential improvements in output power and thermal efficiency that methanol offers for a super-charged high compression ratio S.I. engine as an automotive prime mover were investigated. They were com- pared with those of a naturally aspirated gasoline engine. As a result the effect of operating parameters such as supercharged boost pressure, charge temperature and ex- haust back pressure on thermal efficiency and output power was clarified quantitatively. Next it was confirmed that a methanol fueled turbocharged 1,3/ S.I. engine with high compression ratio of 11:1 achieved almost the same output performance as that of a gasoline fueled naturally aspirated 2.0 Z engine. This engine also realized a lean burn system with high compression ratio and low NOx characteristics of methanol and achieved extremely good roll economy. The improvement in thermal efficiency was as much as 30 per- cent compared with a naturally aspirated gasoline engine having the same engine size. 830124. A review of engine advanced cycle and Rankine bottoming cycle and their loss evaluations. Simon K. Chen and Rocky Lin, PEI Consultants. Turbo aftercooled vehicle engine is widely accepted today. Two-stage turbo intercooled and aftercooled engines up to 300-350 bmep are in initial application stages for some me- dium speed stationary and marine diesels. Turbo compound engine has been tested and developed; the adiabatic engine concept has recently been advanced. For these advanced diesels, exhaust heat is a major source of engine perform- ance improvement. Rankine bottom cycle has been applied the last few years to stationary engines for further exhaust heat recov- ery. Due to initial cost, complexity, and reliability of addi- tional heat recovery equipment needed, few prototypes have been installed. Engine cycle exhaust is used as bottom cycle source heat as shown in the illustration below. This simplified H-S diagram gives a birds-eye view of how a basic diesel cycle and Rankine bottom cycle are coupled. The advancement of the adiabatic concept renders interesting potential for addi- tional exhaust heat recovery. 830125. A fast response turbocharging system. Anthony Nekut, Reeves Callaway, and Charles Kuenhl, Callaway Turbosystems, Inc., Lyme, CT. A simple control system is described which improves the transient performance of turbocharged automotive gasoline engines by removing the compressor from the intake air- flow when boost pressure is not required. Experimental results are presented showing a considerable reduction in the time required to attain steady state boost pressure after rapid throttle openings from part load. 830126. Assessment of resistance spot welds in low car- bon and high strength steel sheet. R. M. Rivett, The Welding Institute Research Lab. The introduction of high strength steels has highlighted the lack of knowledge regarding the properties required of re- sistance spot welds, particularly in the vehicle industry. The laboratory static and dynamic tests currently employed can- not be used to predict performance under service condi- tions, and there is a further complication because of lack of standardisation of test techniques. Specimen dimensions strongly influence the results when the properties of welds in low carbon and high strength steels are compared. The suitability of routine shop floor tests used in mass production industries has been questioned with regard to the necessity of generating plug failure. This cannot be re- solved until the significance of plug failure in high strength steels is established. If plug failure is not essential, weld size can be determined by employing high speed metallurgical techniques for steels giving interface failure. 830127. The effect of surface carbon on the spot weldabil- ity of a microalloyed 60 ksi cold-rolled steel. Ro- nald D. Adamczyk and David W. Dickinson, Re- public Steel Corporation - Research Center. The surface condition of sheet steel has been noted in the past to affect the occurrence of interfacial nugget failures of spot welds during qualification testing. A microalloyed 60 ksi minimum yield strength cold-rolled steel was observed to have an unusually high incidence of interfacial nugget tears when welded in the as-received condition, but virtu- ally no interfacial tears when wiped before welding. Sam- ples of welds from both the as-received and wiped materials were examined to determine the surface characteristic causing the interfacial failures. Using Auger surface analysis techniques, the presence of a high concentration of carbon relative to iron was ob- served on the surface. This carbonacious surface was found to be detrimental to the formation of successful spot welds. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the diffusion bonded region of the weld heat-affected zone of the spot welds in the as-received material was significantly 39</page><page sequence="21">830127-830134 smaller than that of the similar region in the cleaned mate- rial. This was evidenced by the extent of the ductile dimple structure found within the heat-affected zone of a tested sample. Additionally, a significantly higher amount of sec- ondary cracking was noted in the heat-affected zone of the as-recieved material. Good spot weldability, as evidenced by ductile nugget pull-out, was found to correlate with signifi- cant heat-affected zone solid-state bonding. When little heat-affected zone bonding was observed, interfacial nugget fracture resulted. A spot weld model describing the plastic zone develop- ment and propagation during a standard peel test has been proposed on the basis of the observations noted in the heat- affected zone. 830128. A new mechanical joining technique for steel compared with spot welding. J. M. Sawhill, Jr., Bethlehem Steel Corp.; and S. E. Sawdon, BTM Corp. Two mechanical joining techniques were compared with spot welding in a number of plain carbon and high-strength steels with or without various metallic and painted coatings. Spot welds had higher static strength than mechanical joints, but the new button-type (crack-free) joint had equivalent fatigue strength at long lives. Relationships were developed to estimate the strength of the button-type me- chanical joint given base metal strength properties and the geometry of the joint. 830129.

This paper is concerned with the influence of the environ- ment on the fatigue behavior of welded aluminum struc- tures and describes methods that have been evolved to im- prove this behaviour. Successful approaches include the application of particular organic coatings and the use of brush peening and combination of the two methods which proved to be cumulatively beneficial. 830130.

A substantial number of utility vehicles are being equipped with small integral engine-driven electrical generators to provide electrical and accessory power. With the variety of installations it is possible to incorrectly size, apply and in- stall the engine-generator set. This paper is presented to provide general guidelines for selection and application of small engine-generators in- stalled on utility vehicles. 1983 SAE Transactions 830131. 120V AC power inverters. Stephen O. Handley, Dynamote Corp. Inverters are solid state devices which change DC to 120V AC electricity. They are sufficiently rugged and relia- ble to make them practical for use on utility vehicles for operating thumpers, tools, lights and induction motor loads. The SCR type rather than the transistor type inverter is generally required for inductive and reactive loads. Static inverters operate from battery input. They pro- vide power without running an engine, but are limited by battery capacity so work best in intermittent load applica- tions. Dynamic inverters operate from alternator input and will handle continuous loads to 7200 watts with truck en- gine running. 1983 SAE Transactions 830133. Finite element analysis and structural optimiza- tion of vehicle wheels. Miloslav Riesner and Ri- chard I. DeVries, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. This paper describes the application of the MSC/NAS- TRAN finite element program to the structural analysis of automotive vehicle wheels and the optimization of wheel designs subject to both NVH and fatigue related constraints. Common wheel design considerations are dis- cussed including wheel tests for both fatigue and stiffness. Techniques for the finite element modelling of wheels sub- jected to such loadings are described including MSC/NASTRAN cyclic symmetry capabilities, solid ele- ment modelling and plate element modelling of wheels. The use of OPUS (Optimization Process Utility System) inter- faced with MSC/NASTRAN for automated design optimi- zation is described. Its application to the structural optimization of a cast aluminum wheel using gage related design variables and both NVH and fatigue related constraints is described. It is concluded that such analytical techniques represent a practical approach to the design, structural analysis, and optimization of automotive vehicle wheels. 1983 SAE Transactions 830134. The SFI program - self-regulation by custom wheel manufacturers. Gale W. Connell, Western Wheel Div., Rockwell International. In order to establish uniform industry standards for custom aftermarket wheels, manufacturers of these wheels have joined together to develop guidelines for wheel design, test- ing, and manufacturing. The organization is named SEMA Foundation, Incorporated, (SFI) and the specifications cover both steel and aluminum automobile and light truck wheels. The specifications include requirements for (1) wheel identification marking, (2) design qualification, (3) periodic design requalification, (4) quality control procedures, (5) 40</page><page sequence="22">830134-830142 independent plant audits, and (6) identification of qualified products. 830135. Automotive wheels, method and procedure for optimal design and testing. Vatroslav Grubisic and Gerhard Fischer, Fraunhofer-Institut für Betriebsfestigkeit (LBF). The paper describes a method for optimal wheel design and shows a systematic procedure for determining acting and allowable stresses in the wheel. The traditional wheel fa- tigue test procedures are criticized because no definite rela- tionship to customer service exists in most cases. The basic design concept, that dimensions should be based on service stresses and allowable stresses is strictly adhered to in the approach and is accomplished by providing a method for simulating service loads in the laboratory and by determin- ing allowable stresses by fatigue testing of representative wheel areas. The operational wheel loads as well as fre- quency distribution of service stresses are discussed. A Flat Base Wheel Roll Test Facility for determining wheel stresses is presented. Also described is a new Biaxial Wheel Durability Test Machine which provides improved simulation of wheel loading conditions and makes it possi- ble to test the total wheel in a single procedure. 1983 SAE Transactions 830136. A test to predict air entrainment in crankcase oils under operating conditions. James F. Widergren, Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA; and Jo- seph J. Clemens, Union Oil Company of Califor- nia, Brea, CA. A new test has been developed to predict the quantity of air entrained in a crankcase oil under automobile engine oper- ating conditions. The test involves measuring the tempera- ture and API Gravity of the oil before agitating with a rotary mixer and again ten minutes after mixing has ceased. From this API Gravity measurement, it can be determined whether the oil will cause air entrainment related problems. This test appears to be more sensitive and more severe than the ASTM D-892-74 test toward air entrainment. The test can be made in one hour or less and the apparatus is very inexpensive. 830138. Injection molding quality control - practical and meaningful tests. Joseph Robert Bennett, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc., Engineering Plas- tics Materials Div., Polymer Products Dept. There are some simple tests which injection molders can use to determine if parts are being produced to specification. Each test should be carefully designed to insure that it relates to the end-use and can detect variations in quality. Quality does have a price but it should be minimized by careful selection of tests emphasizing those which are prac- tical and meaningful. 830140. Statistical applications in automotive urethane molding. John Terninko, Davidson Rubber Div., Ex-Cell-O Corp. Statistical techniques have been used to improve manufac- turing processes. Examples using several levels of statistical sophistication are presented. Some of the problems with the introduction and acceptance of statistical thinking is in- cluded. A statistically designed experiment reduced scrap from 50% to zero. "WHEN YOU CAN MEASURE what you are talk- ing about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it. . ." Wm. Thompson, Lord Kelvin Statistical techniques utilize several levels of sophisti- cation from frequency charts to designed experiments. Con- trol charts are often considered Statistical Process Control (SPC), but only identify process changes. In order to deter- mine the cause of such changes, the use of brainstorming and fish bone diagrams may be required. Documentation of critical factors or optimal values may also require designed experiments. Changing the problem solving approaches of an orga- nization requires time and patience. Dramatic success such as reducing scrap from 50% to zero is a strong motivator to try statistical techniques. 830141. Practical applications of statistical quality con- trol in SMC molding plant. Rueben L. Smith, The Budd Co. Statistical Process Control (SPC) techniques have been available to Process Engineers for decades but only recently have they been more widely practiced by U.S. firms. In- creased competition from foreign firms and increased con- cern for quality control within the automotive industry have dictated that all parties throughout the manufacturing chain be more aggressive in resolving processing problems. As suppliers within that chain, manufacturers of compres- sion molding SMC (sheet molding compound) can signifi- cantly improve their processing techniques by successfully implementing Statistical Process Control. 830142. Method for determining the "long term wavi- ness" of large SMC-panels. Jürgen Günter, Daimler-Benz AG. A new method is described for determining the long term waviness of large and shaped body panels made from SMC or other materials. Line tracing with a digital length gauge is used in combination with a computer to recreate characteristic pro- file graphs of the range of surface structure determined by the plastic. The graphs have straight mean lines, indepen- dent from the original panel shape and cover up to more than 1 m in length. A "quality index" is defined. It is used for the quanti- tative assessment of the optical quality of the surface. 41</page><page sequence="23">830142 - 830148 Furthermore the computer program permits an en- largement of interesting details of the measured panel lines. 830143. Comparison of the 3-cylinder Dl-diesel with tur- bocharger or Comprex-supercharger. E. Gaschl- er, W. Eib, and W. Rhode, Research Division, Volkswagenwerk AG, Wolfsburg, Germany. The swirl chamber Diesel engine of the Volkswagen Rabbit has set standards as far as fuel economy is concerned. The introduction of direct fuel injection in passenger car Diesel engines constitutes another step in the same direction. For installation in the "Auto 2000" prototype devel- oped by Volkswagen Research, an engine was made which shows a number of new technologies designed for compli- ance with future exhaust emission standards as well as fur- ther improvement in fuel economy. From the 1.6-1 Rabbit Diesel engine was formed with direct fuel injection, an electronically controlled fuel injec- tion pump and a turbocharging system. A 3-cylinder engine is advantageous in that it requires less space and is lighter. Furthermore, a low- volume (1.2 1) Diesel engine will be able to run in the low-consumption areas in the engine map in both the US and the ECE- tests since it will be exposed to a relatively high load. Direct fuel injection, in turn, offers better thermal effi- ciency, so that a reduction in specific fuel consumption of about 15% might reasonably be expected. An electronic fuel injection pump facilitates optimum adjustmemt of a number of engine parameters, especially injection timing and full-load behavior. A supercharging system offers a higher power output as well as more torque and better fuel economy at an in- creased BMEP. This report presents data obtained on engine test beds and roads using a turbocharger (TC) and a Comprex pressure wave supercharger (CX). Further conclusions with respect to road performance are shown. The development potential of neither supercharging system has been fully exhausted during the work covered by this report. 830145. Some fundamental considerations concerning the pressure charging of small diesel engines. F. S. Bhinder, The Hatfield Polytechnic, Hatfield, Herts, U.K. Some of the drawbacks of the diesel engine, such as low power/weight ratio, high noise level and high unit cost, may be overcome by pressure charging. The paper examines the pros and cons of the three available methods for pressure charging with particular reference to the problems of the small diesel for the passenger car market. 830146. A single cylinder engine study of lean super- charged operation for spark ignition engines. K. R. Schmid and R. T. Johnson, Mechanical Engi- neering Dept., Univ. of Missouri-Rolla, Rolla, MO. A comprehensive test program was conducted using a sin- gle cylinder CFR engine to evaluate lean supercharged op- eration (LSO) of the spark ignition engine for improved efficiency. The intake manifold pressure and temperature and the exhaust pressure were controlled to simulate the addition of turbocharger to the engine. Results of the experimental work indicated that LSO has the potential of improved engine efficiency and NOx emissions comparable to, or lower than, the naturally aspi- rated engine. For equal power output from the engine, effi- ciency increases of 14% were accompanied by reductions in Brake Specific NOx (BSNOx) emissions of approximately 76%. For a case of equal BSNOx emissions, an efficiency improvement of 6.4 points (over 40%) was observed. For operation at realistic lean supercharged conditions, the hy- drocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions were not signifi- cantly different than those for the naturally aspirated en- gine. Exhaust energy estimates for the lean supercharged conditions tested indicated that sufficient exhaust energy is available to power a typical automotive type turbocharger. 830147. Improved spark ignition engine efficiency through lean turbocharged operation. R. T. John- son and K. R. Schmid, Mechanical Engineering Dept., Univ. of Missouri-Rolla, Rolla, MO. A production turbocharged V-6 engine of 3.8 liter (231 cu. in.) displacement volume was used in this study of lean turbocharged operation. The engine was modified for lean operation (A/F = 19-20:1) and manual control of the fuel flow, compressor discharge pressure, and EGR rates. Test conditions included loads and speeds to simulate road-load and 4% grade operating conditions, as well as constant intake manifold pressure tests. The results from the test program indicated that lean turbocharged operation has a potential for increased effi- ciency and reduced NOx emissions if operated at brake mean effective pressures of 500 kPa and above. For these operating conditions, HC and CO emissions are comparable to those of the naturally aspirated engine. NOx emissions were reduced by up to 50% over those for the naturally aspirated engine with EGR. Efficiency increases of up to 3 points (10%) were observed. Satisfactory detonation con- trol for engines operating at these conditions will require comprehensive control of equivalence ratio, spark timing, and compressor discharge pressure. 830148. Thermal stress and strength prediction of diesel engine cylinder head. Yasuhiro Nozue, Hiromi- chi Satoh, and Shin'ichi Umetáni, Komatsu Ltd. This paper describes the research which objective is to es- tablish the method to predict the crack initiation life of the diesel engine cylinder head caused by thermal fatigue. Both experimental and analytical researches were carried out. The experiments were to determine thermal and mechanical boundary conditions, applying a foil-type thermo-couple and a high-temperature strain gauge. FEM models for heat 42</page><page sequence="24">830148-830155 transfer and thermal stress analysis were prepared and re- fined based on the experimental results. Finally, the authors propose a prediction method, which consists of simplified FEM analysis and evaluation of thermal fatigue strength. 830150. Computer program for evaluating reciprocating engine airflow and exhaust stack performance. Robert A. Yano and James L. Harp, Jr., Thermo Mechanical Systems Co. A computer program (PISTON) has been developed for evaluating air and exhaust flow parameters within the cylin- der and the exhaust manifold of single or multi-cylinder reciprocating engines. The PISTON Code has been experi- mentally verified to accurately determine such 1) air and exhaust flows (including volumetric efficiency, trapped mass, and blowthrough), 2) piston pumping horsepower, and 3) cylinder and exhaust stack pressures, temperatures, and horsepowers (both instantaneous and average). A tur- bocompounded system, including a blowdown exhaust stack designed using the PISTON Code, increased the en- gine BHP output of the Army's 525 CID VHO diesel en- gine by over 25%. This program serves as a useful tool for designing re- ciprocating engines for optimum performance, i.e. increased airflow, reduced pumping horsepower, and/or increased exhaust energy utilization. 830151. Exhaust valve geometry and its effect on gas ve- locity and turbulence in an exhaust port. S. G. Oldfield, Atkins Research and Development, Ep- som, England (Formerly of Imperial College, London); and N. Watson, Imperial College of Science &amp; Technology, London, England. The influence of fluid flow phenomenon in the exhaust valve and port region on available energy at the turbine of a turbocharged diesel engine is discussed. Zones of high fluid shear, recirculation and vortex shedding all increase fluid entropy and heat transfer and reduce turbine available energy. Detailed measurement of fluid velocity and turbulence intensity downstream of the exhaust valve have been made for six valve designs. The fluid flow characteristics are dis- cussed and the influence of geometric design changes pre- sented. Overall discharge coefficients are included. The data will also be useful for validation of detailed fluid dynamic models of flow through valves. 830152. Motorcycle suspension design - state-of-the-art survey, 1983. Jon S. McKibben, McKibben Engi- neering Corp. Evolutionary changes have produced significant improve- ments in motorcycle ride, handling, stability and control. These changes include improvements in chassis geometry, wheel travel, damping, user adjustability and structural stiffness. Within the short span of the last decade, both highway and offroad motorcycles have achieved substan- tially higher levels of chassis performance. Using current model machines, it is possible to clearly identify trends in chassis development, and to illustrate the very high level of technical sophistication of modern motorcycles. 830153. Advanced motorcycle brake systems - recent re- sults. John W. Zellner, Dynamic Research, Inc. Results of an evaluation of possible advanced brake compo- nents and systems for motorcycles are reviewed. Potential improved conventional brake components included: friction materials aimed at improving wet brake performance; and components affecting brake system feel properties. A proto- type all-mechanical antilock brake system was evaluated. Results showed improvements in performance may be real- ized via all three of these areas, based on prototype results that might apply to future designs. 1983 SAE Transactions 830154. A new facility for testing motorcycle tires. Christopher B. Winkler and Michael R. Hagan, The University of Michigan, Transportation Re- search Institute. Analysis of the dynamic modes of the single-track vehicle has been hampered by the general lack of facilities for gath- ering force and moment data on motorcycle tires under dynamic test conditions. The facility described was de- signed and constructed by UMTRI under the sponsorship of the HONDA Research and Development Company in order to alleviate this problem. Unlike conventional tire dynamometers, this new facility allows for testing under dynamic conditions and provides for non-zero path curva- ture. These particular capabilities hold promise for ad- vancement in the state-of-the-art understanding of the dy- namic operating modes of the single-track, pneumatic-tired vehicle. The facility is unique in its physical design in that it employs a small, light tire-mounting head which is con- trolled by a machanically simple system of servo-controlled hydraulic cylinders. This mechanical simplicity is achieved, however, at the cost of a complex electronic control system involving substantial on-line digital calculation. 1983 SAE Transactions 830155. A weave model for motorcycle engineers. Ri- chard A. (Rit) Booth, Jr., Harley-Davidson Mo- tor Co., Inc. A theoretical model to predict weave mode behavior of a single track vehicle is presented. The three degree-of- freedom model includes rear caster effects only. Tire force characteristics are based on dynamic tire testing conducted for Harley-Davidson at the Calspan TIRF. Parameters from the linearized equations are suitable as a guide for two wheel vehicle design. 43</page><page sequence="25">830156-830162 830156. The effect of handlebar fairings on motorcycle aerodynamics. Kevin R. Cooper, The National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, Canada. A series of wind tunnel experiments were used to quantify the mean and unsteady aerodynamic forces on a motorcycle fitted with a handlebar fairing and a handlebar windshield. The results have shown that the positive aerodynamic yaw damping of the steerable front frame tends to stabilize wob- ble mode when a handlebar device is present. The mean front-frame yawing moments as a function of yaw angle were harder to interpret without use of a dynamic simula- tion. Static arguments were advanced to suggest that cross- wind response may be reduced with a fairing or windshield mounted. 830157. The performance and handling of a top fuel drag motorcycle. David H. Weir and John W. Zellner, Dynamic Research, Inc. The design and development of a top fuel drag motorcycle are reviewed from the standpoints of performance, stability and handling, and rider safety. The paper begins with a summary of design requirements related to longitudinal performance, lateral/directional stability and control, struc- tural properties, rider factors, organizational rules, and the fact that drag racing is a spectator sport. A contemporary top fuel dragster design is used as an example case study. Analytical results illustrate the effects of aerodynamics, and varying other design parameters, on performance and sta- bility. A principal result is that adequate down load must be maintained on the front tire. The results suggest that safety and good handling need not compromise ultimate perform- ance, and that the required tradeoffs can be guided by anal- ysis at the design stage. 830158. Tread contribution to tire rolling loss. D. J. Schuring, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Central Research Laboratories, Akron, OH. Tires built from compounds with equal storage moduli but different loss moduli for tread and body were subjected to designed tests on both roadwheel and twin rolls. The results allowed computation of the tread contribution to the total rolling loss, at various loads and pressures. On twin rolls, the relative tread contribution was much higher than it was on the roadwheel (typically, 60% vs 30%). On both ma- chines, the loss contribution of the tread depended strongly on its loss modulus and on tire load; the effect of inflation pressure was small. 1983 SAE Transactions 830159. Tredloc belts - a unique technology for radial ply tires. John E. Footit, Armstrong Rubber Co., New Haven, CT. Modern radial ply tires most commonly utilize a multiple cut ply composite belt to reinforce the tread region of the tire. The woven belt is a unique alternate radial ply tread reinforcement. This system constitutes an innovative ad- vancement in radial ply construction technology. The wo- ven belt is a unit structure composed of rubber covered multiple cord strips interlaced to form a complex pattern. Woven belts are splice free and are also effectively free of cut reinforcement cord endings. In direct comparison to tires with conventional cut belts, woven belts demonstrate superior performance characteristics in several areas. Most notable among these performance factors are improved du- rability while underinflated/overloaded and superior high speed performance. 1 983 SAE Transactions 830160. The effects of five basic design and construction parameters on radial tire rolling resistance and cornering force. Steve L. Walter, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. The Effects of Tire Design/Construction Parameters: Mold Tread Radius, Tread Arc Width to Section Width Ratio, Aspect Ratio, Belt Width to Tread Arc Width Ratio, and Crown Angle were studied. By building tires with combina- tions of these parameters selected to fulfill the requirements of a designed experiment it was possible to determine the direct and interactive effects of these parameters on rolling resistance and cornering force. The results of these tests, including suggestions for optimum tire design, are dis- cussed. 1983 SAE Transactions 830161. Instrumented car responses during obstacle en- velopment by rolling tires. M. Muthukrishnan, Research Division, The General Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Akron, OH. Experimental studies were carried out to obtain instru- mented car responses during impact with a simulated road obstacle. A cleat 2" wide X 0.5" high X 15" long (5.08 cm X 1.27 cm X 38.1 cm) was employed to simulate tar strip- like road irregularities. The tests were conducted both on the roadwheel and on the road. Two automobiles of differ- ent weights were used with two different size tires. Test speeds were 30, 50 and 60 mph (48, 80 and 96 kmh). The axle accelerations, the floor acceleration and the interior noise were measured. The time and frequency domain char- acteristics were determined for all the test data. These re- sults were compared with the resonant characteristics of the tires to determine the tire-car interaction effects towards vibration and noise transmission. 830162. Low-modulus fiat-proofing media for pneumatic tires. Jack E. Gieck, CINEMARK, Inc., Akron, OH; and Ransome J. Wyman, ARNCO, South Gate, CA. This paper describes the development and performance testing of a family of unique, low-modulus, elastomeric tire- filling media for puncture-proofing of heavy-duty pneu- matic tires. Static and dynamic properties are evaluated in comparison with air inflation, including such factors as 44</page><page sequence="26">830162-830171 ride, rolling resistance, internal heat build-up, and durabil- ity. 1983 SAE Transactions 830164. Energy-conserving engine oils - techniques and technology. Richard F. Irwin and Frank Fernan- dez, ORONITE ADDITIVES DIVISION, Chevron Chemical Company. A new category of lubricants is now entering the market- place. These lubricants, known as Energy-Conserving En- gine Oils, have required new formulating technology and testing techniques. This paper reviews one approach taken to develop and utilize new test techniques and their applica- tion to new formulating technology. Interacting effects of lubricating oil additives and their relationship to both vis- cometric and friction modification effects are identified. Both gasoline and diesel passenger car crankcase oil tech- nology are covered. The utilization of bench, laboratory engine dynamometer, vehicle chassis dynamometer, and field tests including the ASTM Energy-Conserving Engine Oil procedure, are discussed along with the correlation of these procedures. 1983 SAE Transactions 830165. An analysis of valve train friction in terms of lubrication principles. J. T. Staron, Advanced Engine Engineering Office, Ford Motor Com- pany; and P. A. Willermet, Engineering and Re- search Staff, Ford Motor Company. Friction losses in a motored 1.6L valve train can be reduced by roller tappets, by needle bearing inserts placed in the rocker arm/fulcrum contact and in the cam journals and by reducing spring tension. Friction reducing engine oil addi- tives reduce valve train friction substantially, but oil viscos- ity has only a limited effect. These results can be quantita- tively accounted for by a simple friction model based on lubrication theory. Both the model and the experimental results are consistent with the idea that the friction losses in the valve train are mainly due to boundary and mixed lubri- cation. 1983 SAE Transactions 830166. Improving the fuel saving benefits of synthetic engine oils. H. V. Lowther, W. L. Maxwell, and T. W. Rogers, Mobil Research &amp; Development Corp. A comprehensive study was conducted to evaluate additives for their ability to reduce the coefficient of friction of syn- thetic engine oils using a laboratory bench test apparatus. A class of additives was identified that also proved effective in providing fuel economy benefits when tested in vehicle dy- namometer evaluations. Additional investigations using the proposed ASTM Five Car Energy Conserving Engine Oil Test Procedure confirmed the fuel saving performance of this specific additive class. This paper also discusses overall engine performance of synthetic engine oils formulated us- ing this unique type of friction reducing additive. A full series of API SF/CC/CD quality level sequence tests, in- cluding critical extended length evaluations, was performed and excellent performance was demonstrated. 830167. Exhaust gas oxygen sensors based on Ti02 films. W. J. Kaiser and E. M. Logothetis, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. This paper discusses the properties of EGO sensors based on thick Ti02 films. These devices are fabricated by depos- iting a Ti02 film on an insulating or conducting substrate. In addition to being inherently inexpensive, planar tech- niques provide flexibility in the fabrication of multicom- ponent structures incorporating temperature compensation and heating elements. Furthermore, Ti02 film sensors are found to possess faster transient response than available Zr02 and ceramic Ti02 sensors. Results of engine studies of the properties of these new Ti02 sensors will be presented and discussed. 1983 SAE Transactions 830169. Sensors in action for quality assurance. Stanley K. Smith and Donald J. Rozsi, Eaton Corp., In- dustrial Automation Systems. This paper describes the use of sensors in a Quality Assur- ance System which encompasses the major departments within a Production Facility. Machining, Assembly, Test, and Storage are included. The purpose of the sensors is to create signals which can be converted into useful informa- tion for use by the appropriate manager, such as Quality Control, Floor Supervision, and Production Control. The information provides data regarding problems at regular intervals enabling management to maintain control of the system. 1983 SAE Transactions 830170. Analysis of piezoelectric benders used as knock sensors. Joe F. Guess, Technicare Ultrasound. Resonant piezoelectric benders are analyzed by use of a lumped-parameter equivalent circuit, each mode being de- scribed by a frequency of resonance, an equivalent mass, a mechanical resistance and electromechanical coupling. The bandwidth of the sensor can be controlled by controlling the coupling through the dimensions of the bender. Exam- ples of the temperature dependence of the sensitivity, band- width, and frequency of peak sensitivity illustrate the effects of different piezoceramic materials, load resistances and electromechanical couplings. 1983 SAE Transactions 830171. Fatigue properties of renitrogenized and dual phase steels. R. Pietrowski, W. F. Gasse, and W. D. Kenny, Dofasco Inc. One of the more effective ways of improving automobile fuel efficiency is by reducing vehicle weight. This can be accomplished through the use of higher strength, lighter 45</page><page sequence="27">830171 -830177 gauge steels. This study concentrates on two such steels (re- nitrogenized and dual phase) that potentially could be used in some fatigue applications. Three dual phase steels with different monotonie strengths were tested, as was some dual phase which was exposed to undervehicle corrosion. Two renitrogenized steels were also tested, as well as a mild steel of similar carbon content. These were tested in the hot rolled condi- tion, and also after forming and aging. Some samples were also cycled intermittently to simulate stop-and-go driving. The data was compared to previously determined HSLA data. 1983 SAE Transactions 830173. Strain-cycle fatigue of sheet and plate steels II: some practical considerations in applying strain- cycle fatigue concepts. G. A. Miller and H. S. Reemsnyder, Bethlehem Steel Corp., Research Department. Variability in published strain-cycle fatigue data was essen- tially independent of grade and strain amplitude for life &lt;2X106 reversals. Correlations between tensile properties and strain-cycle fatigue parameters were either not statisti- cally significant or so highly variable as to be of doubtful practical importance. However, for a life of 2X106 rever- sals, total strain amplitude Ae/2 bore a significant relation to tensile strength cru. Present findings emphasize the need for caution in estimating life when data are unavailable since such estimates encompassed a range in life 10 to 100 times greater than was actually observed. 1983 SAE Transactions 830174. Notch fatigue strengths of several high-strength low-alloy sheet steels. Shrikant P. Bhat, Inland Steel Research Laboratories. Most structural components contain geometric discontinui- ties or notches. Over the years, several approximate meth- ods have been developed to relate the remote stress (S) to the local stress (o") and the local strain (e) under conditions of localized plastic yielding during fatigue. Recently, the author has developed a new method of computing the fa- tigue strength reduction factor (Kf) in the presence of a notch. The method estimates the notch root stresses from strain controlled fatigue data for any given life. The present paper illustrates the application of this technique by pre- senting data for several HSLA steels. In particular, the data are presented for hot rolled, dual phase, and galvanized sheet steels. It is shown that the Kf values are a function of life level and that this functional dependence is specific to the steel. Practical implications of these data in materials substitution programs are illustrated by calculating the po- tential thickness reductions when using HSLA steels for fatigue critical applications. 1983 SAE Transactions 830175. Strain-cycle fatigue of sheet and plate steels I: test method development and data presentation. G. A. Miller and H. S. Reemsnyder, Bethlehem Steel Corp., Research Department. A method was developed for performing strain-controlled fatigue tests on steel specimens with thickness &lt;0.1 inch. Data generated using this method were found to be con- sistent with published results for steels of similar strength and thickness. Geometric variables, i.e., gage section width and area, gage length, etc., have little effect on valid fatigue results (excluding buckling, excessive bending, and out-of- gage length failures). However, increased gage length or specimen width increase the likelihood of invalid results. 1983 SAE Transactions 830176. Strain-cycle fatigue of sheet and plate steels III: tests of notched specimens. G. A. Miller and H. S. Reemsnyder, Bethlehem Steel Corp., Research Department. The effect of steel grade on reversals to crack initiation in notched specimens 2Ni essentially reflected differences in tensile strength. The higher strength grades (B80RK, RQC100) required a greater value of the notch parameter KfAS for a given 2Ni than the lower strength grades (1020,A36,B40PO). Stress ratio R had a significant effect on 2Ni with 2Ni increasing as R decreased from 0 to -1. The various predictive models studied (local strain, nominal stress, empirical) gave similar results in terms of the varia- bility in estimates of 2Ni and the relation between the pre- dicted and observed values. 1983 SAE Transactions 830177. The horizontal hot chamber die casting machine - a new concept in hot chamber die casting. John I. Harvill, Harvill Machine, Inc., Perris, CA. Current day requirements for die castings for automotive decorative applications have been previously limited in wall thicknesses and design configurations because of limitations of the hot chamber die casting machine. The papers arising out of the Australian Die Casting Congress in 1977 reflected on the current problems with the present vertical hot chamber design of die casting machines. Study of these inherent design problems led to the realiza- tion that a new concept of hot chamber die casting is called for if we are to achieve the higher metal velocities and pressures now called for to make the ultra thin hot chamber parts now required in die casting. Also, world pressures are dictating new designs to make all machinery safer to protect the operator and to make the machinery more efficient to keep our environment cleaner and to use less fuel supplies. Studying this problem, Harvill Machine, Inc. has de- veloped a new concept in hot chamber die casting, the new Horizontal Hot Chamber die™ casting machine. 46</page><page sequence="28">830178-830183 830178.

This study builds upon the National Academy of Sciences study in the rapidly changing area of diesel particulate cost- benefit analysis and updates it where appropriate based on new data or analysis. It does not generate new information but merely reviews and analyzes existing data.

The description of the regeneration behavior of diesel particulate traps with the aid of a mathe- matical model. E. Pauli, G. Lepperhoff, and F. Pischinger, RWTH AACHEN. Monolithic ceramic filters, suitable for reducing particulate emissions to within the 0,2 g/mile emissions limit, are inter- mittantly loaded and regenerated. A mathematical model was developed in order to describe the processes which take place in the filter during regeneration. The basis of the calculation model, such as reaction kinetics, heat and mass transfer, energy and mass balance, and flow performance are explained. Filter temperature, soot oxidation and ex- haust flow behavior are described over the length of a filter channel. A calculated and measured regeneration sequence for an engine operating point near engine full load are illus- trated and compared. The results show that due to the prevailing higher temperatures, an intensified soot oxida- tion occurs at the rear of the channel. A comparison of calculated and measured regeneration requirements as well as salient oxidation parameters leads to the definition of an engine operating range where the minimum regeneration requirements are satisfied. In this range the filtered soot mass and the oxidizing soot mass are in equilibrium. 830181. Application of a ceramic wall flow Alter to under- ground diesel emissions reduction. J. S.

A large frontal area wall flow filter has been developed for application to heavy duty vehicles such as are utilized in underground workings. Laboratory and in-mine operation has defined critical operating parameters including: 1) soot removal efficiency, 2) initial back pressure and rate of pressure rise with oper- ating time, 3) physical durability of filter units subjected to rigorous mining machine inertial forces and vibration, and 4) regeneration of filter units by in situ combustion of ac- cumulated material. An analysis of the economic aspects of filter use in underground environments is presented. 830182. Effect of ash accumulation on the performance of diesel exhaust particulate traps. Rakesh Sachdev, Victor W. Wong, and Syed M. Shahed, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. This paper describes the study and the results obtained to determine the performance deterioration of diesel particu- late traps due to ash accumulation. Based on the ash emis- sion rate in an engine exhaust and the full-size trap volume, a flow and distance simulation technique was developed to translate the results from bench tests of small scaled down traps to engine conditions. Fuel doped with metallo-organic additives was used to accelerate the ash loading of the scaled traps. The study was conducted on both a cellular ceramic trap and a wire-mesh trap. Results indicate that for a 60 liter, ceramic trap mounted on the exhaust of a heavy duty engine, the pressure drop, AP, will double in approxi- mately 90,000 km. It is also seen that for the same size wire-mesh trap, the AP will increase by 70% of the clean trap AP in about 200,000 km. The paper also describes the work done to determine the effect of particulate trap pore size on ash accumulation in cellular ceramic traps. Traps of various pore sizes were subjected to accelerated loading of ash and then subjected to repeated regenerations. Results show that ash trapping seems to be irreversible. 1983 SAE Transactions 830183. Real-time measurement of diesel particulate emissions with a light extinction opacity meter. Daniel H. Gerke, Caterpillar Tractor Co. A system has been developed that provides real-time measurement of heavy-duty diesel engine particulates emitted during the EPA transient emission test cycle. This is accomplished by measuring the opacity of the exhaust/air mixture in an EPA type dilution tunnel with a light extinc- tion opacity meter. Simultaneously, the temperature in the dilution tunnel is measured, and the ratio of the dilution tunnel temperature to a standard temperature is used to correct the opacity signal to standard conditions. The outstanding features of the system are that it pro- duces a continuous record of when particulates were gener- ated during the 20-minute transient cycle and that particu- late cycle results are available immediately upon 47</page><page sequence="29">830183-830187 completion of the transient cycle without the requirement of conditioning and weighing filters. Results to date indicate correlation of the opacity- particulate monitor measured particulates to gravimetri- cally determined particulates to be within 10% for specific engines. 1983 SAE Transactions 830184. (P-121) The reliability of anthropometric test devices, cadavers, and mathematical models as pedestrian surrogates. Peter F. Niederer, Max Schlumpf, François Mesqui, and Paul-André Hartmann, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. The performance of pedestrian surrogates including a math- ematical model is assessed on the basis of a comparison between a sample of real accidents and the results of simu- lated collisions. For this purpose a representative standard test program was derived from the characteristics of real accidents. A substantial increase in average injury severity is observed in reality between impact speeds of 25 and 35 km/h. This finding is reflected in the simulated collisions insofar, as the measured or calculated loadings of the surro- gate in general exceed the known tolerance limits only if the impact speed is in excess of 30 km/h. The lack of surrogate motion prior to impact is shown to cause the largest differ- ences in comparison to real accident circumstances and their outcome. Moreover, the details of the measured ac- celerations during contact exhibit a large variability and their significance with regard to injury mechanisms remains to be established. 1983 SAE Transactions 830185. (P-121) Comparison of behaviours for PART 572 and APROD dummies tested as pedestrians im- pacted by a car, under identical test conditioning. F. Brun-Cassan, C. Tarrière, and A. Fay on, La- boratoire de Physiologie et de Biomécanique Peugeot SA/Renault; and G. Mauron, Labora- toire de Sécurité Automobile Peugeot SA. Experimental simulations of car pedestrian collisions were conducted with production cars impacting a pedestrian dummy derived from PART 572; the tests were performed under well standardized conditions to try to limit experi- mental dispersions. The results corresponding to one series of tests are presented. The comparison of kinematical behaviour of this dummy and human subjects impacted by another way un- der identical realistic test conditions displayed differences in kinematics and response at impact between these two kinds of surrogates. These differences can be explained largely by the greater stiffness of the PART 572 dummy, as compared to human subjects. For this reason, it was determined to duplicate the tests performed with the PART 572 dummy with a new series of tests with one APROD dummy, modified in a pedestrian version. This dummy is more flexible, especially at the thorax and shoulder levels than the PART 572 one and it may be supposed that these improvements for side impact would give also a better response, in pedestrian acci- dents situation. So, ten tests are conducted with the AP- ROD dummy in as identical as possible test conditions; the kinematics between this dummy and the PART 572 one at impact against the vehicle are compared and the measure- ments values related to protection criteria are analyzed with reference to the results obtained previously with the PART 572 dummy. 830186. (P-121) Comparison of pedestrian kinematics and injuries in staged impact tests with cadavers and mathematical 2D simulations. S. Backaitis and S. Daniel, National Highway Traffic Safety Admin- istration; and D. Cesari and C. Cavallero, Orga- nisme National de Sécurité Routière. The paper presents a comparison of kinematic responses between the MVMA-2D and the MAC-DAN pedestrian models and pedestrian cadaver kinematics observed in staged car/pedestrian impact tests. The paper also discusses the injuries experienced in the cadaver tests. Seven cadaver specimens in the standing posture were impacted at 25 mph by two different cars: one having a steel bumper and the other having a plastic bumper. The MVMA-2D and MAC-DAN mathematical pedestrian models were employed to simulate pedestrian impacts at 25 mph by a vehicle with a stylized geometry that is similar to the vehicles used in cadaver tests. Comparison of the simu- lations and the cadaver tests show that both models require further refinement to be able to more accurately simulate the kinematics of the lower legs during impacts with the vehicle bumper. Whereas for the head and thorax segments the MAC-DAN model simulates more accurately the tim- ing and the location of impacts, the MVMA-2D model was found to need further modifications in the stiffness charac- terization of the upper thorax. Results of the tests and cadaver injuries are presented. 830187. (P-121) Empirical injury prediction of the pe- destrian thorax. Hong-Yuh Lin, John F. Wiechel, and Dennis A. Guenther, Ohio State Univ., Co- lumbus, OH. The development of injury predictive models for pedestrian thoracic impact based on experimental data obtained in a previous study is presented. The data consists of ten cadav- eric test subjects including eight side and two frontal im- pacts. A ten accelerometer array was mounted on the tho- rax to define thoracic kinematics. Three types of parameters, Q, B, and PSD, are developed to summarize each acceleration signal. A statistical regression is per- formed to generate empirical models for predicting the in- jury level (number of rib fractures) from these parameters. Coefficients of determination for these models range from 0.8 to 0.99 with the new PSD parameter showing exciting 48</page><page sequence="30">830187-830198 promise. Success of these parameters in predicting thoracic injury implies a relationship with frequency, particularly in the neighborhood of 60 Hz. 830188. (P-121) Evaluation of pedestrian lower limbs in- jury severity: proposals for a detailed scale. J. Farisse, J. Bonnoit, B. Seriat-Gautier, N. Daou, and O. Lang, Laboratoire d'Anatomie - Faculté de Médecine de Marseille (Pr GAMBARELLI). During the last three years, our Group which is entitled FOC - bringing together the Faculté de Médecine in Mar- seille. The Organisme National de Sécurité Routière, and the Citroën-PSA Group, has been investigating experimen- tal lesions produced by impacts of vehicles against pedestri- ans. The authors of this study are all researchers in this field, and face the problem of evaluating quantitatively the severity of the different lesions that are observed, whether these be isolated or associated with others. Application of the AIS scaling method is a procedure which has the merit of existing, of being understood and of being adopted throughout the world; from our own direct experience it has however seemed to us necessary to draw attention to the imperfections of this method, doing so on the basis of fifty homogeneous impacts that have been studied. From the moment when the morphological analysis of cadaver investigations is performed, obvious distortions are ob- served. These distortions will be confirmed later on, by examination of the clinical files. Since our purpose in analysing the lesions produced by different types of vehicle was to be able to make proposals to vehicle manufacturers concerning the shapes and struc- tures of bodywork that would be less injurious, it has seemed essential to us that the AIS scaling method should be complemented by a certain number of additional param- eters. 830189. (P-121) Experimental reconstruction and mathe- matical modelling of real world pedestrian acci- dents. S. J. Ashton, Accident Research Unit, Uni- versity of Birmingham, England; D. Cesari, Organisme National de Sécurité Routière, Labo- ratoire des Chocs et de Biomécanique, Bron, France; and J. van Wijk, Research Institute for Road Vehicles TNO, Delft, The Netherlands. Several similar real world pedestrian accidents are de- scribed and a number of different methods of reconstruct- ing these accidents are reported. The results of full scale experimental reconstructions of two of the accidents using both dummies and cadavers as the pedestrian surrogate are presented. The effects on the pedestrian's head contact with the vehicle of variations in the initial impact conditions are examined by computer simulation using the MADYMO two dimensional mathematical model. The reproduction of the vehicle damage resulting from pedestrian head contact in four of the accidents using an impactor is then described. The relative merits of different methods of reproducing accidents are considered and a methodology for the reproduction of real world accidents outlined. 1983 SAE Transactions 830193. Performance and design considerations for material-handling aerial devices. Richard A. Moyer, Asplundh Manufacturing Division. Economies of labor and equipment are being achieved in the utility industry through the use of material-handling aerial devices. Proper designs and configurations are achieved by giving consideration to factors such as operat- ing methods, intended uses, material-handling components, boom construction, safety factors, chassis requirements and testing. 830194. Standardization of digger derrick capacity rat- ings. Frank D. Freudenthal, Altec Industries, Inc. Utility digger derricks are usually classified by their capac- ity rating with the booms fully retracted and fully elevated. This is not a practical working position. A more meaningful comparison of useful lifting capacities can be made when the rating classification is the load which can be lifted by the digger derrick lift cylinder at a ten foot load radius. Lifting capacities at lower boom angles are also important for digger derrick applications. 1983 SAE Transactions 830198. Utility fleet users experience with front wheel drive on cars and light trucks - survey results. J. E. Wales, Houston Lighting &amp; Power Co. The United States auto makers have been and are still ac- tively phasing rear wheel drive automobiles out of produc- tion, which will leave the fleet purchaser without a choice as to front or rear wheel automobiles. While the manufac- turing of front wheel drive only light trucks has not become a reality as has front wheel drive automobiles, the possibil- ity of front wheel drive light trucks does exist. For this survey, only utility companies and companies which lease to utility companies were contacted. A ques- tionnaire was distributed in order to determine fleet vehicle user's experience with front wheel drive automobiles and light trucks (4X4). The information provided in this doc- ument represents their experience. The purpose of the survey is to determine the place that front wheel drive vehicles have in these fleets. Data shows that approximately fifteen percent (15%) of the auto- mobiles are front wheel drive and four percent (4%) of the light trucks are front wheel drive (4X4). The maintenance cost for front wheel drive automobiles is basically the same as the maintenance cost for rear wheel drive automobiles 49</page><page sequence="31">830198 - 830207 whereas the maintenance cost for front wheel drive light trucks is more than the cost of rear wheel drive. 830199.

The development and implementation of a vehicle inte- grated 800 Mhz cellular telephone system is described. Par- ticular emphasis is placed on the interconnection of existing vehicle systems through the use of digital data links. It is shown that systems integration can provide increased fea- ture content in a vehicle without the corresponding space requirements. It is also shown that ergonomie advantages may be realized with integrated systems over discrete sys- tems. 830200. Evaluating acoustic warning signals in automo- bile interiors. Charles E. Spiekermann, Clark J. Radcliffe, and Erik D. Goodman, A.H. Case Center for Computer-Aided Design, College of Engineering, Michigan State Univ.; and Thomas M. Gwozdek, Electrical and Electronics Div., Ford Motor Co. The use of acoustic warning signals to provide information about vehicle conditions to the driver and passengers is now possible through application of advanced electronics in re- cent automobile designs. These acoustic warning signals may be tones or synthesized voice. The signals can only be effective if they are audible and distinguishable by the vehi- cle occupants without being at an irritating level. This pa- per presents a method for measuring acoustic intensity in an automobile interior using the cross-spectral technique which may assist in determining audibility of signals. Effec- tive methods for displaying these quantitative vector mea- surements using computer graphics are presented along with the results of testing. Finally, an important future need of correlating acoustic intensity measurements with pub- lished human perception levels is discussed. 1983 SAE Transactions 830201.

Thomas A. Spoto, Ford Motor Co., Electrical &amp; Electronics Division. Throughout the evolution of the electronic digital clock several approaches have been used in specifying, designing, and developing the integrated circuits. This paper reviews a recent approach which utilizes a low-end microprocessor for timekeeping and highlights some interesting events in the development of the component. 830205. Automatic final test of electronic clocks. W. N. Frick, Equipment Engrg., Ford Aerospace and Communications Corp. An automatic test system which eliminates the need for human judgement from the in-process production testing of Electronic Clocks is described. The system, designed on a building block concept, is composed mostly of commer- cially available equipment with a minimum amount of custom hardware. Solid state electronic cameras and an in-house developed computer vision system eliminate the need for an operator to view the displays of the clocks while they are under test. 830207. A cost effective microcontroller based automobile instrument cluster. Venkata T. Gobburu, Na- tional Semiconductor Corp. Dedicated microprocessor systems find increasing applica- tions in automobile instrumentation. Fuel injection systems, digital radio tuners and similar applications employing the microcontroller have become common place. This paper describes a cost effective microcontroller implementation of an automobile instrument cluster by the COPS™ group of National Semiconductor, Santa Clara. The instrument cluster provides a vacuum fluorescent display of the vehicle speed, engine RPM, odometers, battery voltage, engine oil pressure and the fuel level. A modular design involving a single microcontroller in conjunction with peripherals to aid in data acquisition from the transducers allows the quantities to be computed with high accuracies and dis- played on a real time basis. The single microcontroller envi- ronment places severe restrictions on the availability of RAM and ROM. Coupled with the requirement of real time operation the application poses a non trivial challenge. A non volatile RAM accumulates the mileage covered. Hamming code techniques ensure the integrity of the data contained in the non volatile memory. Inclusion of diag- nostics allows a rapid and thorough check against improper operation of the microcontroller, peripherals and the non- volatile memory. This paper describes the implementation 50</page><page sequence="32">830207-830214 with a COP 444L containing 128 nybbles of RAM and 2K bytes of ROM. A display updation rate of 16 Hz can be comfortably realized. 830208. Implementing CMOS into an automotive trip computer. Frederick O. R. Miesterfeld and Glen S. Johnstone, Engineering &amp; Research Office, Chrysler Corp. The normal procedure for automotive electronic product development is a slowly evolving process, that is paced by the development of components that are used in the prod- uct. Seldom does the normal evolution of components have the potential to cause a breakthrough in products as the application of High Performance CMOS technology (HCMOS) to microcomputers. This paper shows how such a microcomputer has affected the design of a 12 function trip computer. Although the features of this trip computer are not new, progress is made in many areas. A method of accomplishing a day-date clock that does not need an exter- nal clock chip will be presented. The implementation of a new A/D converter chip is discussed. A hardware dimming technique for vacuum fluorescent displays will be presented and the application of a new high-efficiency display power supply is examined. 830209. GM Commodore and J Car Trip Computers. J. J. Nuske, VDO Instruments Australia Pty. Ltd. The Australian instrument designer is faced with unique requirements due to small production runs, operating envi- ronment and country topography. These requirements are reflected in the design of GM Australia's Commodore and J Car Trip Computers. This paper reviews the design con- cepts, operating principles and construction techniques for these instruments. 830210. Optimizing combustion seals on diesel engines. Richard J. Kozerski, Victor Products Div., Dana Corp. The yieldable wire fire ring gasket has been used with good success in the majority of domestic medium and heavy duty diesel engines. With this type of head gasket design, the wire ring is attached to the gasket body by means of a thin stainless steel element (flange). The applied clamping force can be broken down into three component forces: combustion unit load, body-under-flange stress and gasket body stress. This paper will cover a design refinement that in- creases the combustion load and the gasket body stress by eliminating the body-under-flange load. Also discussed is an approach whereby the combustion seal seating load can be tailored for a particular application by providing a wire fire ring with a variable thickness around its circumference. In addition to better load distribution, these designs can provide cost-effective approaches to improvements in block counterbore loading, tolerance control on gasket op- erating thickness and bore distortion. 830211. Cylinder head gasket sealing of indirect com- bustion diesel engines. Robert S. Pearlstein and Lawrence F. Pyle, Fel-Pro Inc. Cylinder head gasket problems are identified and discussed for indirect combustion light duty diesel engines. Bi-metal considerations, engine testing, force analysis, precombus- tion chamber factors, gasket coatings and surface finish of the mating flanges are reviewed. Included is a discussion of various design approaches used for the cylinder head gas- ket. 830212. Thermal shock testing head gaskets. Richard G. Russell and Terrence T. Connelly, McCord Gasket Div., Ex-Cell-O Corp. Cylinder head gasket tests which quickly measure the per- formance of design and material alternatives have been de- veloped. The paper describes the engine operating condi- tions, the equipment used, the techniques for avoiding unrelated breakdowns, and the criteria for measuring gas- ket performance. 830213. Static testing methods for evaluating head gasket performance. A. Yates and P. N. W. Dudley, Payen International Limited. Through the experimental work conducted on dynamic test engines with strain gauge tools, transducers and thermo- couples it has been found that static test methods can be developed which closely simulates the behaviour of cylinder head gaskets on a dynamic test engine. To make full use of this information for static work it is necessary to obtain the data on components that affect the sealing performance of the gasket. The true bolt load- ings, clamping loads and the head and block materials all make their contribution on the type of gasket construction and its design configuration. The paper describes the information required and also some of the rigs that have been designed to obtain informa- tion on gasket materials and compositions for static test evaluation. 830214. Gasket designs and applications using flexible graphite. P. S. Petrunich, Union Carbide Corpo- ration, Carbon Products Division. High performance gasket technology has been based on elastomeric-bonded, fiber-filled materials with asbestos fi- bers historically affording the optimum price-performance benefits. Binder-free, non-asbestos, flexible graphite has temperature-pressure capabilities superior to those of asbestos-based products and can be made into a wide range of useful gaskets with simple fabrication techniques. Essen- tial design characteristics of flexible graphite are over- viewed and compared with those of elastomeric-bonded asbestos and non-asbestos materials. Several specific head gasket and exhaust sealing applications are cited. 51</page><page sequence="33">830216-830223 830216. Design considerations of deflection in a rigid flange gasket joint. Jess W. Oren, Armstrong World Industries, Inc. The deflection of a rigid flange as it affects and is in turn affected by varying amounts of gasket compression between the bolt holes is mathematically analyzed. Fiber-polymeric gaskets that can be further compressed beyond the com- pression at their sealing stress are shown to permit varying degrees of flange deflection while maintaining sealing crite- ria. The flange design factors of bolt span and deflection as they affect required flange thickness are discussed. Flange bending stress rather than the ability of the gasket material to seal is shown to impose an upper limit on the deflection. 1983 SAE Transactions 830217. A review of gasket material standards. Alexander L. Gordon, Vellumoid, Inc. The historical development of present standards for gasket materials has occurred over a period of almost forty years. The major portion of the work has been done by ASTM Committee F-3 with the collaboration of SAE. Coordina- tion and participation by the U.S. Government has been obtained. The most widely used standard is a classification system published by SAE and ASTM. A modified form of the system is published as a military specification. Applica- ble test methods are published by ASTM. 830218. Performance and reliability of non-asbestos gas- keting materials. Douglas H. Tracy and Bruce M. Arnio, Rogers Corp. Some non-asbestos gasketing materials have proven to be equal to (and some superior to) asbestos reinforced gasket- ing materials under severe service conditions. Proper selec- tion of materials for performance/cost considerations given the service requirements is essential. Data comparing non- asbestos gasket materials to conventional products over a wide range of simulated application parameters will be pre- sented. Emphasis will be placed on data and test conditions that can be used to predict functionality and reliability of gasket materials. 830219. Designing with thermal insulating gasketing and gasketing systems. M. T. Passarella, F. D. Far- nam Div., Colt Industries Corp. In fluid sealing and non-fluid sealing gasket applications, the ultimate user aim may be reducing heat transfer. Mate- rial choices range from cellulose to asbestos (and asbestos substitutes), ceramics, cork, and fiberboard, engineering plastics, synthetic fibers, blends, and both 'hard* and 'soft' composites. Engineering textbooks give conductance values of some materials, generally under free-state conditions, and non-elevated temperatures. In design gasketing, how- ever, additional details on these and other factors may be required. Recognizing this need, work proceeded within the framework of ASTM to develop a test procedure. Com- pleted in 1977, and entitled 'Evaluating Thermal Conduc- tivity of Gasket Materials", the procedure has been used to develop improved materials and specifications. This paper will call attention to 'k' factors of many materials and the factors influencing heat transfer charac- teristics using this equipment. 830220. Functional testing devices for gasket materials. Mark A. Moser, Armstrong World Industries. Although standard physical property tests such as density, tensile, compressibility, and immersions are important, they are not indicative of how a gasket meterial will perform in an actual application. Therefore, four functional testing devices were built to evaluate the sealability, torque retention, required flange pressure, and chemical resistance of gasket materials. 830221. (SP-541) A least-cost method for prioritizing battery research. R. F. Giese and W. J. Walsh, Argonne National Laboratory. A methodology has been developed for identifying the com- bination of battery characteristics which lead to least-cost electric vehicles. Battery interrelationships include specific power vs. specific energy, peak power vs. specific energy and DOD, cycle life vs. DOD, cost vs. specific energy and peak power, and volumetric and battery size effects. The method is illustrated for the "second car" mission assuming lead/acid batteries. Reductions in life-cycle costs associated with future battery research breakthroughs are estimated using a sensitivity technique. A research prioritization system is described. 1983 SAE Transactions 830222. (SP-541) The systems role in the development of electric and hybrid vehicle batteries. Donald W. Kurtz, EHV Systems R&amp;D Project, Jet Propul- sion Laboratory. A successful subsystem development must be properly guided by an interactive systems activity.

Toda, Higashi-Fuji Tech- nology Center, Toyota Motor Co. 52</page><page sequence="34">830223 - 830229 A study on battery-vehicle design interactions was per- formed jointly by Argonne National Laboratory and Toyota Motor Company. A Toyota Hi-Ace van converted to elec- tric drive was used to model the performance of the vehicle. Power train requirements were calculated on the basis of achieving performance equivalent to that of gasoline- engine or diesel-powered vehicles. Vehicle energy require- ments were obtained by integrating the power required to complete a SAE J227a/D cycle. A weight analysis for the conversion was completed as well as a preliminary design to locate the batteries within the vehicle without encroaching upon passenger space. The power/energy ratio of the battery was determined as a function of the vehicle range. Specifications for the vehicle and battery for several cases of interest (e.g., gasoline or diesel type acceleration) are given. 830225. (SP-541) Transformation toughening of beta ''-alumina. James R. Rasmussen, Lakshmina- ravan Viswanathan, and Gerald R. Miller, Cera- matec, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT; and Anil V. Virkar, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT. The fracture toughness and fracture strength of beta "-alumina are critical material properties for insuring reliable assembly, performance and lifetime of sodium- sulfur batteries in electric vehicle applications. The fracture toughness of the electrolyte is of major importance because it has been shown that the critical sodium ion current den- sity for electrolyte degradation is proportional to the frac- ture toughness of the electrolyte to the fourth power. High fracture strength of the electrolyte is required for making and maintaining reliable seals to the insulating header. Greater fracture strength and toughness of beta "-alumina can be attained through transformation toughening while maintaining tolerable ionic resistivities. 830227. (SP-541) How synergetic is a siesta for an elec- tric sedan? F. Hornstra, C. Swoboda, D. Corp, D. Fredrickson, C. Webster, C. C. Christianson, and N. P. Yao, Argonne National Laboratory, Ar- gonne, IL. Lead-acid batteries were tested at the National Battery Test Laboratory at Argonne National Laboratory to determine the effects on the range of an electric vehicle of rest periods introduced during the vehicle use. Rest periods ranging from zero through four hours were chosen to simulate no break, a coffee break, a lunch break, and a work break. Preliminary results suggest that no increase in range can be expected as a result of the rest periods regardless of their length; moreover, it appears that in some cases a slight loss in battery capacity, and therefore in range, may occur as the battery cools during the rest period. Similar testing of the nickel/iron battery system is now underway. 830228. (SP-541) Impact of mismatched cell characteris- tics on lead-acid battery charging. W. H. De- Luca, A. F. Tummillo, R. L. Biwer, and N. P. Yao, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL. Over the operational life of a battery, the voltage character- istics of its individual cells become mismatched due to dif- ferences in self-discharge rates, individual charge efficiency, active material retention, etc. As these cell differences in- crease, excessive overcharging, operating temperatures, and/or electrolyte consumption result. In a series of tests performed on 6-volt, lead-acid modules, the degree of cell mismatch and the response of the modules to various charge methods were examined. The results show that after about 150 deep-discharge cycles, each module contained at least one cell whose full-charge voltage level was reduced. Prior to any decline in module capacity, cell voltage differ- ences of more than 0.4 V were measured during charge. It was also observed that the application of a fixed battery voltage for charge control eventually caused excessive over- charging, elevated temperatures, and/or an extreme over- voltage condition on individual cells. This paper describes the test procedures employed, presents the test data, dis- cusses the results obtained and solutions being investigated. 830229. (SP-541) Thermal management of lead-acid bat- teries for electric vehicles. Bryan L. McKinney, Gary L. Wierschem, and Edward N. Mrotek, Johnson Controls, Inc., Globe Battery Div., Mil- waukee, WI. A Globe Battery Division EV-3000 electric vehicle battery with its in-cell electrolyte circulation pumps was instru- mented with temperature sensors and subjected to singular and repetitive deep discharge cycles while being cooled by natural and forced air convection. Temperature excursions within the battery became severe with repetitive cycling and natural convection cooling. The EV-JOOO's in-cell electro- lyte pumps were shown to be a definite aid to battery thermo-regulation by i) allowing the charging process to be more energy efficient and thus generating less total heat, ii) reducing peak cell temperature, iii) producing a more uni- form temperature distribution within the cells, and iv) transporting the elevated temperature, dense electrolyte produced during charge from the cell stack area to a more active heat transfer surface. Experiments have shown that forced air convection on the external surfaces of the battery can provide effective cooling when the battery is operated under moderate duty cycles and ambient temperatures. It is anticipated, however, that high energy density batteries may require more elaborate thermal management when subjected to elevated duty cycles or extreme external tem- peratures. 1983 SAE Transactions 53</page><page sequence="35">830231 - 830240 830231.

George Gyarmathy, BBC Brown, Boveri &amp; Co., Ltd., Baden, Switzerland. The paper describes the aerodynamic principle of the Comprex® pressure-wave supercharger (PWS) and explains how gas-dynamic phenomena can be utilized to create a mechanically simple and robust boosting device for vehicles which permits the combination of excellent driveability, low fuel consumption and low emission without reliance on complicated control systems. The main features of the PWS are described and a few examples of recent applications to automobile Diesel en- gines are shown. 830237. The edge formability of high-strength cold-rolled steel. Ronald D. Adamczyk, David W. Dickin- son, and Ronald P. Krupitzer, Republic Steel Corp.-Research Center, Independence, OH. Little information is available about the influence of inclu- sions and edge condition on the edge formability of cold- rolled steels. For this reason, a series of high-strength cold- rolled steels was evaluated through the hole expansion test. The steels examined were a rephosphorized steel, microalloyed 50 and 60 ksi steels, and recovery annealed 60 and 70 ksi steels. Edge formability has been found to be greatly influ- enced by the condition of the punched edge. Samples that were "dressed" (i.e., by removal of the shear burr along with the worked metal at the edge) exhibited a larger per- centage hole expansion when compared to those evaluated in the as-blanked condition. The effect of inclusions on crack initiation is more significant in the de-burred condi- tion than in the as-blanked condition because of the lower incidence of defect sites present at the edge. Hole expansion was found to be better in materials having higher total elongation and plastic anisotropy, rm. Likewise, an increase in tensile strength was found to be detrimental to hole ex- pansion performance. The percentage hole expansion was not affected by variations in the observable crack length. Therefore, this test is insensitive to crack length within the normal limits of the test, and thus is not operator- dependent. Microstructural analysis supports the argument that cold-rolled high-strength containing a high density of inclusions will exhibit reduced edge formability. 1983 SAE Transactions 830238. A portable springback tester for in-plant determi- nation of the strength of sheet steels. W. G. Granzow, Armco Inc.-Research and Technol- ogy. A hand tool that uses springback to measure the strength of sheet steels to within ±10 ksi is described. The device should be useful in stamping and fabricating plants that do not have tensile test equipment, to prevent mild steels from being mistakenly formed into critical high strength parts. 830239. Modified sequence V-D test with two engines us- ing alcohol fuels. G. K. Chui and E. T. King, Research, Ford Motor Co.; and W. P. Groff, Southwest Research Institute. Modifying the standard Sequence V-D test for alcohol fuels requires material changes in the fuel handling system, addi- tion of a fine mesh fuel filter and the provision for easy fuel drainage. Besides rejetting the carburetors, the initial ring gaps of the 2.3L engine are reduced to maintain the blowby level of the standard test. Large oil consumption necessi- tates a modified oil leveling procedure. Precise measure- ments of the rings, bores, and valve-train components are essential to the evaluation of oil performance. Wear of a 2.3L engine using alcohols is larger than using gasoline. Special oils can be formulated to mitigate the wear problem. To test the 1.6L engine with the Sequence V-D procedure requires extensive modification to the production carbure- tor and some plumbing changes of the standard test stand. Load and initial oil charge are scaled to reflect the smaller engine requirements. Wear of the 1.6L engine is less severe than the 2.3L. 830240. Development of an engine screening test to study the effect of methanol fuel on crankcase oils. S. Chaibongsai, B. J. Howlett, and D. H. T. Millard, Paramins Technology Div., Exxon Chemical Co. An engine screening test has been successfully developed to study the effect on bore and ring wear of crankcase oils in methanol-fueled spark ignition engines. The cyclical Se- quence V-D test procedure was modified and used in the 2.3L engine for this development. The main modifications were as follows: The engine was equipped with an oil filter, dual carburetors and an oil flushing mechanism. The metals content in the used oil samples were moni- tored as a bore and ring wear indicator and oil quality was differentiated effectively in 4 to 22 hours of testing. As a 54</page><page sequence="36">830240-830246 result, two fully formulated oils have been defined. The per- formance of these oils exceeds the SF specification limits in methanol-fueled V-D testing and reduces bore and ring wear to almost the same levels as typically seen in gasoline-fueled engines. These products are now undergoing extensive field evaluation. 1983 SAE Transactions 830242. Test stand evaluations of commercial lubricants with mathanol and tertiary butyl alcohol blends. J. M. DeJovine, D. A. Drake, and M. A. Mays, Atlantic Richfield Co., Harvey Technical Center. With the emergence of oxygenates as blending components in unleaded gasolines in the last few years, concern has been voiced as to the effects these materials may have on the wear characteristics of commercial engine oils. To help de- fine these effects, if any, Atlantic Richfield initiated a pro- gram whereby gasoline grade tertiary butyl alcohol and methanol/gasoline grade tertiary butyl alcohol were blended into a base unleaded gasoline at various concentra- tions and individually tested with several commercial SF engine oils in a series of modified ASTM Sequence VD tests. Although it is known that neat methanol greatly in- creases engine wear rates, the tests conducted here indicate that the alcohol blends up to 4.5V% methanol/4. 5 V% GTBA are compatible with properly formulated engine oils and do not increase wear rates over that of unleaded gaso- line. Other parameters such as sludge and varnish were also found to be unaffected or slightly improved with the addi- tion of the alcohol(s) to the base test fuel. 830243. Total cylinder sampling from a diesel engine: part III - particle measurements. Cao Jian Du and David B. Kittelson, Dept. of Mechanical Engi- neering, University of Minnesota. Particle formation, growth, coagulation and combustion in the cylinder of an indirect injection passenger car type die- sel engine have been studied using a system which allows the cylinder contents to be rapidly expelled through a blowdown port, diluted, and collected in a sample bag for subsequent analysis. Characteristic blowdown times were about 0.5 ms. Samples were analyzed using a condensation nuclei counter to determine particle number concentrations and an electrical aerosol analyzer to determine particle vol- ume concentrations in the 0.01 to 1.0 ļim diameter range. Measurements were made with the engine operating at 1000 rpm and an equivalence ratio of 0.32. Peak particle number concentration in the cylinder 13 times the exhaust level, and peak particle volume (or mass) concentration in the cylinder 3 times the exhaust level were observed. These results suggest that significant particle coagulation and oxi- dation occur during the expansion stroke. 1983 SAE Transactions 830244. Interferometrie studies of vapourising and com- busting sprays. P. A. Lakshminarayan and J. C. Dent, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Lough- borough University of Technology, Loughbo- rough, England. Holographic interferometry has been applied to the study of concentration and temperature distribution in transient va- pourising non-burning and burning fuel sprays in a quies- cent bomb. Empirical relations have been obtained to describe the axial and radial variations of concentration in the vapouris- ing non-burning spray, and to evaluate penetration and air entrainment of the free and wall jet regions of non-burning and burning sprays. The movement of the 'tail' of the spray in the post injection period has been studied. Finally, data are presented for species concentration and temperature profiles within the burning spray. 1983 SAE Transactions 830245. Effect of oxygen enrichment on the performance and emissions of I.D.I. diesel engines. Jamil Ghojel, Visiting Fulbright Hays Scholar, Univer- sity of Damascus; and John C. Hilliard and John A. Levendis, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the partial pressure of 02 in the intake charge of an I.D.I. diesel engine on the various operating parameters and the exhaust emissions. The oxygen content in the intake was varied between 21% and 40% by volume. Engine performance and emissions were evaluated at constant engine speed and injection timing while fueling was varied. The research re- vealed that enriching the intake air with oxygen led to a large decrease in ignition delay and reduced combustion noise. The fuel economy, the power output and the exhaust temperature remained almost constant. HC and CO emis- sions decreased and smoke levels dropped substantially, while NOx emissions increased pro-rata with the 02 added. Theoretical analysis using the ZePdovich kinetics showed that nitric oxide emissions are sensitive to "mean NO-formation temperature" and the combustion duration associated with this temperature, and, to a lesser extent, the atomic oxygen concentration. The theoretical analysis re- vealed close correlation between calculated and measured NO emissions. 830246. Expanding diesel engine cetane limits through staged injection. Quentin A. Baker, Southwest Research Institute. Interest in alternative diesel fuels has led to consideration of various types of poor ignition quality products, such as a broad cut fuel or a synthetic fuel/DF-2 blend. Attempts were made to expand the cetane number tolerance limit of an EMD 567B medium-speed diesel engine through staged injection to permit operation on such fuels. A small portion of the fuel was injected early in the cycle to act as a pilot for the main fuel charge. Both pilot and main charges were the 55</page><page sequence="37">830246-830254 same fuel. Knocking was eliminated on fuels with cetane numbers as low as 17 at the standard 16:1 compression ra- tio. Attempts to operate on methanol at 20:1 failed, but such operation may be feasible with further modifications. 830247. The 1982 GMI supermileage experience. David A. Renfroe and Bruce P. Henderson, GMI Engi- neering &amp; Management Institute. GMI Engineering &amp; Management Institute uses the SAE Supermileage Competition as a means of enhancing the design aspect of its engineering curriculum. The project is integrated into senior level courses and involves many stu- dents each year. GMFs 1982 effort emphasized maximizing engine effi- ciency via a re-designed combustion chamber, 12:1 com- pression ratio, and an overhead valve train. Chassis work centered upon minimum weight and drag losses. Official performance was 350 mpg. Engine starting difficulties and unforeseen chain drive reliability problems detracted from performance. Ambitious plans for 1983 include a complete new vehicle designed by 1982 veterans, and a re-designed version of GMI's 1982 car implemented by a new crew. 830250. Several esoteric considerations in the design of a gasoline powered super mileage vehicle. Richard D. Rabbitt, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; and John E. Nametz and Richard N. Wright, Michi- gan State University. The need for increased fuel efficiency in conventional auto- mobiles has motivated the design of lightweight, single passenger, super mileage vehicles. Typical low budget super mileage vehicles are capable of attaining 1000 to 1500 miles per gallon of gasoline. The present work discusses unique features of a high mileage vehicle designed and constructed by a research coterie at Michigan State University. More significant contributions of the coterie include an electronic engine and vehicle control system, a vehicle operation opti- mization analysis, and a computerized method of designing cam lobes based on flow mach numbers. These subjects are considered along with several customary design problems. 830251. The role of static and dynamic finite element analysis in designing low-noise cylinder blocks. Yo Usuba, Isao Nagayama, Yasushi Araki, and Katsuyo Kakuta, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Yoko- hama/Japan). The finite element method is now being used for designing low-noise cylinder blocks. Either static or dynamic analysis is generally used to determine the block structure. How- ever, investigation of the cylinder block behavior of a run- ning engine shows that the vibration consists of two phe- nomena, which are the initial elastic deformation and the natural vibration. Therefore, it is necessary to study both phenomena by using simulation techniques in order to de- termine the optimum design of a low-noise cylinder block, taking into consideration its weight. In this study, static and dynamic finite element anal- yses were applied to simulate each phenomenon, and the relationship between the static and dynamic response and the components of the cylinder block was examined. The results indicate that the modification for the cylin- der block to reduce the initial deformation is different from one to suppress the natural vibration. Thus, both static and dynamic finite element analysis should be utilized in design- ing low-noise cylinder blocks. 1983 SAE Transactions 830252. Ceramic fiber reinforced piston for bigh perform- ance diesel engines. Tadashi Donomoto, Maťl. Process Engrg., Toyota Motor Corp.; Kiyoshi Funatani, Maťl. Res. &amp; Dev. Dept., Toyota Mo- tor Corp.; Nobuhiro Miura, Engine Engrg., Toyota Motor Corp.; and Noriaki Miyake, Res. &amp; Dev. Dept., Art Metal Mfg. Co., Ltd. A Ceramic Fiber Reinforced Aluminum Matrix Composite has been developed that has excellent wear resistance, sei- zure resistance against cast iron, good thermal conductivity and high strength at elevated temperatures. By strengthen- ing top land and top ring groove of piston with the Alumi- num Matrix Composites, a newly designed Diesel Engine attained excellent performance without sacrificing manu- facturing cost and productivity. 1983 SAE Transactions 830253. Application of a newly developed iron-base supe- ralloy to exhaust valves of diesel engines. Tetsuo Kato, Masakuni Fujikura, and Tomohito Iikubo, Daido Steel Company, Ltd.; and Teruo Isomura, Masaki Matsuno, and Hiroshi Hirayama, Fuji Valve Co., Ltd. The exhaust valves of 21-4N or 21-2N generally have hard- faced heads for heavy-duty engines. Hardfacing alloys con- tain a large amount of cobalt (Co), which sometimes be- comes very scarce and outrageously expensive. Therefore, some automakers have adopted nickel (Ni)-base superalloys as unfaced exhaust valves, but continued to search for less expensive heat resisting alloy. The authors had succeeded in developing an iron (Fe)- base superalloy, RS 914, containing 40% Ni, 19% Cr, 2.8% Ti and 0.7% Al. The mechanical and chemical properties of this alloy had proved to be comparable with those of Ni- base Inconel 751. And unfaced exhaust valves of RS 914 passed endurance tests in turbo-charged diesel engines with minimal damage. This alloy is relatively low cost and easy to fabricate, so that it can be applied for unfaced exhaust valves substituting for Ni-base superalloys. 830254. Development of sintered integral camshaft. Chiaki Thumuki, Katsuhiko Ueda, Hitoshi Na- kamura, Katsumi Kondo, and Tetsuya Suganu- ma, Toyota Motor Corp. 56</page><page sequence="38">830254-830261 The camshaft for an automobile engine is generally made of chilled cast iron. Due to increasing demand for higher per- formance, lower maintenance and better fuel economy, it is difficult to make the cast iron camshaft lighter and/or more durable. In order to overcome these problems, development of an integral camshaft comprised of a sintered alloy cam piece for better wear resistance and steel tube for weight saving has been accomplished. In 1981 Toyota Motor Corporation successively started the mass-production of the sintered integral camshaft for the new 1.8 liter Is engine. The significant advantages are as follows; (1) Weight saving (2) Excellent wear resistance (3) Improvement of lubrication system (4) Saving machining cost 1983 SAE Transactions 830255. Extending the life of roller chain camshaft drives for internal combustion engines. D. N. C. Davies, P. J. Owen, and G. Riley, Renold PLC. The paper deals with wear performance of roller chain cam- shaft drives, with particular reference to engine condition and its effect on lubricating qualities of automotive oils and the consequences concerning chain wear. Serious lube oil contamination is a feature frequently encountered in diesel engines and can also arise in gasoline units brought on by certain aspects of engine design, service intervals and the type of vehicle usage. The development story of a special Extra Life Roller Chain is dealt with in detail, involving engine and rig eval- uation together with comparative chain wear tests on used automotive oils in various stages of contamination from a variety of known applicational duties. The work culminates in the development of a chro- mised pin chain giving exceptional extra life, combating the effect of lube oil contamination. 830257. Engine mount optimization. James E. Bernard, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Michigan State University; and John M. Starkey, Dept. of Me- chanical Engineering, Purdue University. Recent work in design optimization has led to software which allows the designer to indicate frequency bands which are undesirable. The software determines the optimal amounts of several design alterations which will move system natural frequencies from undesirable bands. This design procedure is shown to be effective in selecting stiff- ness, orientation, and location of engine mounts which re- move engine natural frequencies from the range excited at idle. 1983 SAE Transactions 830258. Engine mount for integral body vehicle. J. A. Cogswell and D. E. Malen, General Motors Corp. A typical problem in integral body vehicles is the isolation of high frequency vibration and noise. A method of attack- ing this problem is presented for isolation of engine noise. A mount concept which acts as a mechanical low pass filter was analyzed, designed and tested. Results in reducing en- gine noise in the vehicle show it to be an effective method. 830259. Simulation of engine idle shake vibration. Clark J. Radcliffe, Mark N. Picklemann, and Charles E. Spiekermann, A. H. Case Center for Computer Aided Design, College of Engineering, Michigan State University; and Donald S. Hine, Oldsmobile Division, General Motors Corp. To assist in the development of engine vibration isolation techniques for new transverse front wheel drive vehicles, simulations of engine and vehicle structural response were developed. A simulation of engine vibration response to engine imbalance forces and firing pulses is presented which provided mount forces as input to a vehicle structure simu- lation. Current design techniques using properties of engine rigid body motion are discussed. Simulation predictions of engine modal characteristics and response correlate well with laboratory measurements of engine motion and mount forces. These results show that connections other than en- gine mounts between engine and vehicle structure such as hoses, drivetrain, and exhaust system are important vibra- tion transmission paths. 830260. Computer aided design analysis of instrument panel impact zone. Ernest B. Skuta, Chrysler Corp. In anticipation of complying with European standards for impact protection, an instrument panel design was analyzed to determine A. impact zone boundaries B. impact test velocities for the head of a front seat passenger. Chrysler com- puter aided design (C.A.D.) surfacing capabilities were uti- lized in the solution. Early knowledge of impact zone location is important to intelligent design decisions; knowledge of impact veloci- ties aids in performing compliance testing. 1983 SAE Transactions 830261. Computer graphics design - the dramatic conver- sion of the work force. George A. Davidson, Ford Motor Co. The work force in design and drafting is undergoing the most dramatic change in its history with the advent of Computer Graphics. The computer and CRT are replacing the traditional T. square, pencil, and compass. Work is being accomplished by one person where manually it would have required several. Even the end product is changing 57</page><page sequence="39">830261 - 830265 from layouts and details to digital data and mathematical surfaces. Retraining the highly skilled and experienced work force is the key to taking full advantage of this rapidly ex- panding technology. 830262. Management of CAD implementation in a power train design activity at Chrysler Corporation. Al- bert M. Damitio, Clifford J. Davis, James R. Lechner, and Bernard J. Ziola, Chrysler Corp., Power Train Engineering. This paper describes the implementation of CAD into an automotive design activity. The method by which the sys- tem was managed is described in detail. The advantages, disadvantages, organizational linkages and management of CAD are discussed and analyzed based on three years of experience. Reduced manpower levels, tight release sched- ules, budget limitations and other restrictions affected im- portant issues of training, project selection and personnel scheduling. These issues are discussed from a system user standpoint. This paper presents actual results rather than CAD expectations. 830263. The experience gained and the spin-off effects resulting from the change-over to a 3D surface definition system in automobile design. Dan Ahlén, Volvo Car Corp., Gothenburg, Sweden. After 10 years of experience as a designer in the body de- partment, during years 1960-1970, 1 was fully familiar with both the good and bad aspects of the older methods. In 1969, with this experience behind me, I joined a working group which had been given the task of rationalizing the drawing and model aspects of design. The process used at that time was well-established and of proved efficiency, and a stage had been reached when the potential for rationali- zation was relatively low. It was considered that the intro- duction of computer assistance into the process would im- prove the possibilities for rationalization. Now, 10 years later, with the results of the work in our hands, we can confirm just how correct this assumption was. The generation of drawings has become a secondary function of our NUFO system, SVEP, while surface genera- tion has become the primary activity; the reason for this is that there is a major difference in the two functions (2D lines + text compared with 3D curves and surfaces), both in basic structure and in rationalization potential. Genera- tion of drawings has, however, been helped significantly by producing basic drawings of all NUFO parts by numerical control and then completing these by hand. Our next objective is to rationalize the production of drawings, by use of either a "turnkey" CAD system, or by a system developed within the group. This would then pro- vide the natural link between the designer and SVEP. 830264. Compression-ignited homogeneous charge com- bustion. Paul M. Najt, University of Wisconsin- Madison, Department of Mechanical Engineer- ing; Present Affiliation: G. M. Engineering Staff, G. M. Tech. Center, Warren, MI; and David E. Foster, University of Wisconsin-Madison, De- partment of Mechanical Engineering. Experimentally obtained energy release results, a semi- empirical ignition model, and an empirical energy release equation developed during this research were used to eval- uate the combustion of compression-ignited homogeneous mixtures of fuel, air, and exhaust products in a CFR engine. A systematic study was carried out to evaluate the response of compression-ignited homogeneous charge (CIHC) com- bustion to changes in operating parameters with emphasis being placed on the phenomena involved rather than the detailed chemical kinetics. This systematic study revealed that the response of the combustion process to changes in operating parameters can be explained in terms of known chemical kinetics, and that through the proper use of tem- perature and species concentrations the oxidation kinetics of hydrocarbon fuels can be sufficiently controlled to allow an engine to be operated in a compression-ignited homoge- neous charge combustion mode. 1 983 SAE Transactions 830265. Determination of the performance of a dual fuel diesel engine with the addition of various liquid fuels to the intake charge. G. A. Karim and N. Amoozegar, Department of Mechanical Engi- neering, The University of Calgary, Calgary, Al- berta, Canada. An examination of the engine performance and associated combustion is made for a dual fuel engine of the compres- sion ignition type when additional auxiliary fuels were in- troduced in turn in the form of a spray into the main intake charge with methane being the main fuel. This was at- tempted with the view of modifying the dual fuel engine behaviour particularly at light load. Alcohols, gasoline, benzene or normal hexane were introduced in turn to vari- ous extents into the intake charge of the engine. Compari- son with dual fuel operation on a range of gaseous fuels and with water spray injection was made. It is shown that gasoline, benzene or n-hexane intake addition reduced the overall ignition delay significantly and increased the power output of the dual fuel diesel engine at light load. This, however, was achieved at the cost of under- mining the efficiency of fuel utilization at higher loads. Moreover, the quenching of the charge resulting from water or alcohols additions appeared to slow down the combus- tion rates necessitating the supply of a certain amount of gaseous fuel and diesel pilot fuel injection for a threshold of adequate combustion. 58</page><page sequence="40">830266-830271 830266. Characterization of flow produced by a high-swirl inlet port. Teoman Uzkan, International Har- vester, Hinsdale, Illinois; Claus Borgnakke, Uni- versity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI; and Tho- mas Morel, Consultant, Hinsdale, MI. The flow produced by an experimental high-swirl intake port was studied by several techniques. These included measurements of flow rate and swirl as a function of valve lift on a steady state bench rig, hot-wire measurements of flow issuing from the valve, and flow visualization in water and air. By applying these techniques together to a single port, a body of data was generated which is presented as an addition to what is known about intake port flows and swirl generation. Data include flow and swirl coefficients, infor- mation on the effects of valve offset and port orientation angle, swirl generation by velocity non-uniformity around the valve, swirl decay in the rig due to air friction on the walls, and forward/backward flow coefficients. The defini- tion of the appropriate dimensionless parameters for port flow characterization is also discussed. 830267. Some considerations of the safety of methane, (CNG), as an automotive fuel - comparison with gasoline, propane and hydrogen operation. G. A. Karim, Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The total number of vehicles fuelled with compressed natural gas, CNG, is relatively very small in comparison to gasoline fuelled vehicles. Accordingly, because of the lack of statistics of accidents involving CNG fuelled vehicles, their safety aspects are evaluated in comparison to automo- biles fuelled with gasoline or some other alternative fuels such as propane, hydrogen, LNG or LH2. It is suggested that methane, CNG, has some excellent physical, chemical and combustion characteristics that make it a safe automo- tive fuel. These characteristics are reviewed and the supe- rior relative safety of methane in automotive applications in comparison to applications involving the other fuels is dem- onstrated where well designed conversion systems and operations are employed. 830268. Lead species in vehicle exhaust: a thermodynamic approach to lead tolerant catalyst design. Brian Harrison, Jeffrey R. Taylor, Alan F. Diwell, and Andrew Salathiel, Johnson Matthey Research Centre. As part of a programme to develop lead tolerant emission control catalysts for Europe, a fundamental thermodynamic approach has been used to achieve an understanding of the lead species in vehicle exhaust under widely varying condi- tions and to consider the possible interactions which may occur between the catalyst and lead species and which may give rise to poisoning. A model has been developed which calculates the gas stream equilibrium and identifies the most stable solid phases which precipitate from the gas phase, until a final equilibrium has been reached. Results covering a wide range of conditions are presented, and com- pared with rig and engine test data - providing a means for determining the proportion and composition of gaseous and solid lead compounds, and the effect of oxygen content and temperature of the exhaust on the lead species formed. The data assist in the design of total vehicle emission systems with improved lead tolerance. 830269. Lead-tolerant catalysts for Europe: the behavior of precious metals on alumina pellets when used with 0.15 or 0.40 g/1 lead in gasoline. M. Prigent, J. P. Brunelle, G. Blanchard, and R. Doziere, Société Procatalyse, Paris La Défense, France. It may be necessary to have recourse to catalysts in Europe to reduce automotive emissions if future legislation imposes very strict limits. Since it is not desirable to forbid the use of lead-base additives in gasoline, such catalysts must be able to withstand lead poisoning. An analysis of poisoning shows that some catalysts resist this form of deactivation better than others and that the same catalyst ages more or less quickly depending on the conditions under which it is used. Improved endurance performances can be obtained by optimizing the active phase of catalysts and their supports, as well as by implementing them at high temperatures. With gasoline containing 0.15 g/1 of lead and after 40 000 km of effective running, 80% CO oxidation and 65% unburned-hydrocarbon oxidation were obtained. With 0.4 g/1 of lead, plugging occurs more quickly, and the reaction of lead deposits with the support at high temperatures tends to degrade the mechanical properties of catalysts. 830270. Lead accumulation on automotive catalysts. R. H. Hammerle and Y. B. Graves, Ford Motor Co. Engine dynamometer and laboratory flow reactor studies of automotive catalyst deactivation caused by the use of leaded fuel indicate that there are two different deactivation mech- anisms: one, which dominates between 700 and 800 C, is the poisoning of the active platinum sites by lead ozide, or perhaps lead, and the other, which occurs below 550 C, is a build up of a gas diffusion barrier of lead sulfate. Both deactivation mechanisms can be temporarily reversed. Poi- soning is reversed when the platinum is freed of lead oxide by lead sulfate formation below 650 C; and the barrier formed below 550 C can be made more permeable by ther- mal sintering of the lead sulfate at 600 to 700 C or its decomposition to lead oxide at 700 to 800 C. However, further exposure of the catalyst will again render it inactive via the mechanism predominating in that temperature re- gion. 1983 SAE Transactions 830271. Effects of ageing cycles on lead tolerant catalyst durability. Michael G. Henk, Jeff J. White, John F. Skowron, and Isik Onal, UOP Inc. 59</page><page sequence="41">830271 - 830278 One of the central points of debate in the discussion of whether oxidation catalysts are capable of working with leaded-fuel is the simulation of in-use mileage accumulation. Various catalyst ageing cycles have been proposed. Some engine cycles have been shown to only slightly deactivate catalysts, while road ageing experience typically produces significant catalyst deactivation. This paper will report the influence of three different engine ageing cycles on oxidation catalyst durability when a typical 0.15 g Pb/liter European fuel is used. Steady-state ageing at either 370°C or 590°C inlet temperatures were compared to a multi-mode cycle with a maximum catalyst inlet temperature of 760°C. The multi-mode cycle was de- veloped as a simulation of the CCMC cycle requirements based on information obtained from characterizing a vehicle driven according to the recommendations of the CCMC. 830272. Design for diagnosability. John W. Eichhorn, Service Research, General Motors Corp. Diagnosability is a feature designed into a car that allows service technicians to quickly and easily pinpoint the cause of a problem. This paper discusses why such a feature is needed and presents some examples. 830274. Quantifying diagnostic performance. R. C. John- son, J. C. Saylor, and W. L. Doelp, Jr., Ford Parts and Service Div., Ford Motor Co., Dear- born, MI. A broadly applicable procedure is presented by which spe- cific performance objectives can be established for diag- nostic procedures. Vehicle failure modes are prioritized by the probability that they will occur, the severity of the resulting vehicle symptom and time required to make the diagnostic tests. This procedure allows the engineer to con- centrate design effort on those issues which most of the time cause customer concerns. 830275. Microwave diagnostics of intake and exhaust valves. A. L. Merlo, DI-AG NOSTIC Instrument Research Co. The object of microwave diagnostics is to provide accurate, noninvasive measurements upon engine components found within the cylinders of internal combustion engines. This paper deals in particular with experiments performed upon the valves of a Buick V-6 engine. A microprocessor con- trolled data processing system is described that (1) collects and stores, in digital form, the microwave signal developed during several engine cycles (2) produces a very high reso- lution computer print out of the stored signal correlated with engine crank angle, and (3) outputs a printed analysis of every microwave resonance found in the signal. Exhaust valve motion produces a directly related shift in the crank angle position of a resonance. The magnitude of the shift in the TEI 1 1 mode resonance is 7 degrees for one cycle in the change of this valve. The maximum displacement of this valve into the cylinder is .200 inch. A displacement of .005 inch can be measured. 1983 SAE Transactions 830276. An on-board microprocessor vehicle diagnostic instrument. James C. Troutner, Zemco, Inc., San Ramon, CA.

Pierson and Richard T. Johnson, GLOBE Battery Division, Johnson Controls Inc. The last eight years have seen a major shift in vehicle design toward smaller, more fuel efficient automobiles and light trucks. Because of their inherent fuel economy advantage, Diesel engines have made a significant entry into the mar- ket. Their extremely high cold cranking power require- ments have in turn created a challenge to battery design engineers. Detailed attention to two areas of battery design has provided the power output improvements necessary for reli- able starting performance. Battery electrical performance goals have been achieved through evolutionary changes in design parameters which were quantified by application of computer modeling techniques to designing for maximum power. Data has been generated for a specific battery group size which contrasts conventional and diesel battery per- formance characteristics. 830278. Hot rolled sheet product consistency-coilbox. William Smith, Stelco Inc. The demand for higher strength, lighter gauge materials by automotive designers, requires superior quality high strength steels from the manufacturer. The modern hot strip mill for supplying these sheet and strip products has developed into a high capacity so- phisticated metallurgical tool. Subtle changes in chemistry, temperature control or the rolling process can produce a variety of strengths, toughness or formability characteristics in the final product. The Coilbox is an innovation in hot strip mill equip- ment that was developed at Stelco for the purpose of over- coming a fundamental hot rolling problem of heat loss from the product during the rolling process. This paper explains the difference between conventional and Coilbox methods of rolling. The benefits of improved surface, gauge control, shape control and metallurgical uniformity are also dis- cussed which can result in a lower cost product for the original equipment manufacturer and component producer. 60</page><page sequence="42">830279 - 830287 830279. Development of high strength steel sheets for wheel rim use. Masatoshi Shinozaki, Yoshihiro Matsumoto, Toshiyuki Kato, and Minoru Nishi- da, Research Laboratories, Kawasaki Steel Corp.; and Norihiro Sudo, Tokyo Head Office, Kawa- saki Steel Corp. Three types of hot-rolled high strength steel sheets having tensile strengths of 600 to 800MPa for wheel rim use were developed. For a fundamental study the effects of chemical compositions on the formability in stretch-flanging and bending on the flash butt welded joints were investigated. In precipitation-hardened steels, the main controlling factors are identified as a newly proposed carbon equivalent value, Mn/Si ratio and S content in steel. P-bearing steels and intercritically heat-treated dual-phase steel hoops are able to be used for rim production. Examples of commercial production of rims are presented. 1983 SAE Transactions 830280. High strength automotive tubing. B. Armitage and J. F. Young, Stelco Inc., Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. High strength tubing is being proposed for replacing solid bar in the design of automotive parts such as anti-roll bars (stabilizers) and MacPherson suspension piston struts. This paper describes how a combination of tubemaking processes can be used to meet the different combinations of tube diameters, and wall thicknesses required by automotive parts manufacturers in three high strength steel grades. The results of a laboratory heat treatment program are also given to illustrate the range of mechanical properties that can be achieved in high strength tubing. 830281. The evolution of plastics in automotive applica- tions. Ronald D. Beck, Consultant. There have been plastics in automobiles almost as long as there have been plastics. This paper deals with plastic molded parts from the 1930's through 1970. These parts include steering wheels, tail light lenses, knobs, electrical connectors, fasteners, speedometer wheels, distributor caps, water pump impellers, dials, and various decorative orna- ments. 830283. Polypropylene - it's only just begun. Ronald J. Reso, Hercules Inc. Twenty years ago, automotive engineers recognized the attractive combination of properties and low cost of poly- propylene. Its color versatility makes it the material of choice for interior trim applications. Its high melting point has made it the work horse in engine compartment applica- tions. Reinforcements and mineral fillers can be added to improve the stiffness and strength properties at elevated temperatures. Copolymers and alloys can be used to im- prove low temperature toughness. This paper will briefly review polypropylene in auto- motive applications in the past, but it will concentrate on current and future trends that will substantially increase the importance of polypropylene to the automotive industry. 830284. The evolution of nylon plastics in U.S. automo- tive applications. John L. Chruma, Monsanto Polymer Products Co. The use of nylon plastics in the U.S. automotive industry has grown from tentative beginnings in a few gears and knobs to a multi-million pound business which places highly specialized engineered resins into virtually every area of a modern vehicle. The keys to this spectacular growth have been nylon's basic properties which allowed replace- ment of metals and other materials with a substance that offered superior performance, and by nylon's ability to be adapted and modified to meet ever changing and increasing performance demands. 830285. Phenolics in automotives - a historical perspec- tive. James F. Keegan, Durez Resins and Mold- ing Materials, Occidental Chemical Corp. Automotive electrical parts were among the first uses of phenolic molding compounds. Improvements in materials, process equipment and molding techniques have mirrored the expanded use and productivity to meet the requirements of lower cost and weight. The ever increasing performance requirements have been met with the "old-but-new" pheno- lic molding materials. 830287. (SP-541) A new stabilized nickel-zinc battery system for electric vehicle applications. M. Eisen- berg, Electrochimica Corp., Mountain View, CA. A substantially modified chemistry for the nickel oxide-zinc battery system has been discovered and developed to stabi- lize the zinc anode and substantially reduce the well-known problems of dendrite shorting, shape change and plate den- sification. As is well known, these phenomenon have been basically responsible for the poor cycle life (typical 100 - 200) normally experienced in this battery system. The introduction of the new chemistry has resulted in stabilization of the performance of the zinc anode without adversely affecting the nickel electrode. The result has been a major enhancement of the cycle life capability. In tests conducted on 15, 60 and 225 AH capacity, nickel-zinc cells, control groups were used for the sake of comparison. Most tests were conducted using a 3 -hour rate of discharge and an 80% depth with a 9-hour recharge rate. Cycle life en- hancement obtained range by a factor of 2 to 4 times with capacity retentions over 60% compared to the true original capacity. A cycle life of at least 500 is shown to be necessary for economic use of the nickel-zinc battery in electric vehicle applications. The new chemistry stabilized battery system provides the opportunity to achieve and exceed this goal on a practical level in full size 15-40 KWH batteries. 61</page><page sequence="43">830288 - 830296 830288. (SP-541) Economic analysis of the zinc-chloride battery in mobile applications. E. V. Hellmann and A. L. Lijoi, Energy Development Associates (A Gulf + Western Company) Madison Heights, MI. The zinc-chloride battery system is being developed for electric vehicle and load-leveling applications. The mobile configuration is the result of placing design emphasis on those areas that significantly impact electric vehicle (EV) performance and life cycle costs. Energy density, power density, packaging, and battery operating voltage primarily effect vehicle performance, which in turn effects market penetration. The zinc-chloride battery, in the mobile config- uration, is described and the resultant EV performance briefly reviewed. Assuming that these vehicle characteris- tics meet market needs, this paper examines the life cycle cost of operating an internal combustion engine (ICE) powered van, breakeven capital cost for a comparable bat- tery powered van, and the sensitivity of the cost elements. 830289. (SP-541) Design of bipolar, flowing electrolyte zinc-bromine electric vehicle battery system. P. A. Malachesky, R. J. Bellows, H. E. Einstein, P. G. Grimes, K. R. Newby, and A. R. Young, Exxon Research &amp; Engineering Co., Linden, NJ. The integration of bipolar, flowing electrolyte zinc-bromine technology into a viable electric vehicle battery system re- quires careful analysis of the requirements placed on the battery system by the EV power train. An analysis of the influence of these factors on zinc-bromine EV battery sys- tem design has been carried out for two types of EV propul- sion systems. The first of these is a nominal 100V dc sys- tem, while the second is a high voltage (200V dc) system as might be used with an advanced design ac propulsion system. Based on these studies, low profile, 12 dm2 bipolar cell components have been developed which are readily incorporated into a variety of motive power and stationary energy storage system designs. 830290. (SP-541) The aluminum-air battery. N. P. Fitz- patrick, F. N. Smith, and P. W. Jeffrey, Alean International Limited, Kingston Laboratories, Kingston, Canada.

(SP-535) Managing technology: a partnership ap- proach. Herbert A. Tews, Midwest Sintered Products Corp. If a business is to be profitable and experience growth in the 1980's and become competitive in the world economy, top management has to reorganize its priorities and systems of capitalizing on emerging technology. A practical approach for large or small businesses is the development of "partnership relations" beyond the company's internal resources. The efficient diffusion and commercialization of technology can be significantly im- proved through a partnership relation. A number of practical suggestions in structuring suc- cessful partnership technology relationships will be re- viewed. 830294. (SP-535) Selection of powder metal materials. Donald A. Gustafson, Imperial Clevite Inc., Powder Metal Products Div., Salem, IN. As a materials based technology, Powder Metallurgy has wide and varied application, the most prominent of which is in the manufacture of mechanical components for the hard goods manufacturers. In spite of P/M's excellent rep- utation in the automotive, appliance, and related industries, the technology has yet to receive the wide acceptance it seeks. Studies commissioned to ascertain the reasons for the lack of full acceptance of P/M by design engineers have indicated that the absence of easily applied materials speci- fications is part of the problem. Measures being taken to ease this difficulty, as well as some suggestions for selecting P/M materials, are discussed. 830295. (SP-535) Design of P/M gears. S. W. McGee, Ervin Industries Inc., Metal Powders Div. Advantages of P/M gearing are economic and technical. The economic advantages derive from excellent material utilization, low labor intensity and high machine tool utili- zation. The technical advantages relate to shape capability for combined functions, part to part uniformity, controlled material elasticity, self-lubricating ability and inherent high surface finish. Attainment of the P/M gearing advantages can be attained by following a design procedure involving: economic justification of tooling; size, form and material classification; identification of tolerance class; identification of material class; and combining P/M design principles. 830296. (SP-535) Design and introduction of P/M parts in the automotive industry. L. A. Winquist, Ford Motor Co. A new P/M part is created due to one of three reasons: 1) Cost savings over a manufacturing method for a current part, 2) Cost savings over an alternative method to manu- facture a new part or, 3) it's the only practical way to manufacture the part. In today's quality conscious atmosphere at Ford the suppliers of P/M parts should be aware of their responsibil- ities in producing a P/M part to required standards. The producer must become involved in early feasibility issues, prove process capability and maintain capability on an on- going basis. A case history of such an evaluation will be discussed from initiation through a second generation de- sign. 62</page><page sequence="44">830299 - 830304 830299. Simple statistical methods. Andrew L. Stron- grich, Gerald E. Herbert, and Thomas J. Jacoby, Saginaw Steering Gear Div. General Motors Corp. The use of simple statistical techniques at Saginaw Steering Gear has resulted in increased productivity and improved quality. Although these simplified statistical tools may not be as technically thorough as the tools taught in the aca- demic world, they have been effectively used by many peo- ple at all levels of the organization. These simplified tools are effective in helping people discuss facts rather than opinions. Utilizing facts helps emphasize the positive ap- proach to problem solving. Simple statistical techniques, together with control charts, provide a method of timely, direct communication between the process and the people. This method allows an accurate assessment of process sta- bility and capability to meet end product requirements. 830300. Statistical control of suspension bushing assem- bly. Gary L. Earnhart, The General Tire &amp; Rub- ber Co. This paper provides information on the sequence of events leading to the introduction of statistical process control of suspension bushing manufacturing. Included are the thoughts and reasoning processes involved in the introduc- tion of the charting methods in a manner conducive to acceptance by manufacturing personnel. Although this pa- per relates to the problems and solutions encountered with one bushing, the techniques have been used successfully in many areas of manufacturing of bushings within the plant. 830301. Comparison tests between major European and North American automotive wind tunnels. R. Buchheim and R. Unger, Volkswagenwerk AG; E. Mercker, German-Dutch Wind Tunnel; Y. Ni- shimura, National Research Council Canada; P. Jousserandot, Renault; F. K. Schenkel, General Motors Corp.; and D. J. Wilsden, Lockheed- Georgia. The results of comparative aerodynamic force measure- ments on a full-scale notchback-type vehicle, performed between 6 European companies operating full-scale auto- motive wind tunnels, were published in the SAE Paper 800140. Correlation tests with the same vehicle have been extended to 2 further European and 3 North American wind tunnels. First the geometry, the design and the flow data of the different wind tunnels is compared. The facilities compared include wind tunnels with open-test-sections, closed-test-sections and one tunnel with slotted side walls. The comparison of results, especially for drag coefficients, show that the correlation between the differently designed wind tunnels is reasonable. Problems of blockage correction are briefly discussed. The comparison tests furthermore re- vealed that careful design of the wheel pads and blockage corrections for lift seem to be very influential in achieving reasonable lift correlations. Six-component measurements show similar problems. Suggestions for improving correla- tions are presented. 1983 SAE Transactions 830302. Slotted-wall test section for automotive aerody- namic tests at yaw. R. G. J. Flay, G. M. Elf- strom, and P. J. F. Clark, DSMA International Inc., Toronto, Canada. A test programme of surface pressure measurements on three car shapes at yaw angles from 0 to 30° in a l/5th- scale slotted-wall test section is described. Comparisons are made with corresponding "reference" results. The low- blockage reference results were obtained in an aeronautical wind tunnel with a solid-wall test section, using the same models and under similar aerodynamic simulation condi- tions. The comparisons verify results of our previous work (at zero yaw) in slotted-wall test sections. Extremely good vehicle surface pressure distributions can be obtained from tests at high blockage in appropriately designed slotted-wall test sections, even at high yaw angles. The important impli- cation of the present results is that based on surface pres- sures, the overall size of a facility of give minimal wall- interference can be considerably reduced from the size of a solid-wall facility which would give an automotive aerodynamic simulation of comparable accuracy. 830303. Predicting automobile aerodynamic characteris- tics using an iterative viscous/potential flow technique. J. Michael Summa and Brian Maskew, Analytical Methods, Inc., Redmond, W A. An iterative viscous/potential flow calculation method is described in this paper. A potential-flow panel method is coupled with integral boundary layer methods. Simple lin- ear doublet sheets are used to enclose the low-energy separated-flow region of the wake. Calculations for various body shapes demonstrate that unseparated flow pressure distributions are accurately calculated. Body lift trends are also properly computed for a simple body with separation only at the base and in close ground proximity. However, the prediction of average base pressure is only partially successful. The base pressures for a limited number of ge- ometries, which include a Porsche 924, are properly pre- dicted, but calculations for other shapes indicate that the separated-flow wake model must be improved for general body shapes. 1983 SAE Transactions 830304. Tractive-energy-based formulae for the impact of aerodynamics on fuel economy over the EPA driving schedules. Gino Sovran, General Motors Research Laboratories. A fuel consumption analysis has been made to determine the impact of changes in aerodynamic drag on fuel econ- omy over the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) driving schedules. It is based on the tractive energy required by vehicles to negotiate those schedules - specifically, on 63</page><page sequence="45">830304 - 830309 the fraction that is required to overcome drag. Formulae for this energy fraction that are applicable to any automobile have been previously derived. In conjunction with empirical inputs on closed-throttle fuel rate and the fuel consumption fraction for engine and vehicle accessories, an expression for the aerodynamic influence coefficient relating any percent- age reduction in drag to the corresponding attainable per- centage reduction in on-road fuel consumption has been for- mulated. The simple formula is used to show the effect of drag changes of various magnitude on EPA Urban, High- way, and Composite fuel consumptions. The equivalent re- ductions in vehicle mass and tire rolling-resistance coeffi- cient required to produce the same fuel saving are also shown. 1983 SAE Transactions 830305. (SP-539) An experimental study of cavitation in hydrodynamically lubricated journal bearings - part I: oil film behaviour. M. O. A. Mokhtar and M. E. Ameen, Mechanical Design and Produc- tion Dept., Faculty of Engineering, Cairo Univer- sity, Egypt. The experimental work herein presented gives a full ac- count of cavitation in hydrodynamically lubricated journal bearings. Using a transparent bearing bush, the lubricant film extent as being influenced by operating conditions and oil inlet design could be accurately observed, recorded and fairly defined. The study showed that cavitation is inevitable in bear- ings operation; low values of load parameter and/or high speeds help in its existance. Both the inlet oil feeding de- signs (single oil inlet hole, axial groove or circumferential groove) and the position of oil inlet relative to the load vector have shown to affect the extent and starting location of oil film. Careful attention should thus be given to the right positioning of oil inlet ports to attain an optimum situation in which minimum cavitated areas are present. 830306. (SP-539) Wear-inhibition by adsorption of poly- meric solution. Horst Wochnowski, Institut für Physikalische Chemie der Universität Hamburg, Hamburg, FRG. Polymers used as viscosity index improvers contribute to the wear-inhibition of multigrade engine oils. Investigations with the model oil of poly(n-butylmethacrylate) in different solvents as basic oil show that friction and wear are depend- ing on state of solvation of the macromolecules, the adsorp- tion of the polymer from solution on solid surface and the heat of wetting of the solvents on iron (Fe). The results are interesting for praxis. 830307. (SP-539) Dynamic behaviour of an elastic connecting-rod bearing - theoretical study. Ber- nard Fantino and Maurice Godet, Laboratoire de Mécanique des Contacts, INSA Lyon, France; and Jean Frêne, Laboratoire de Mécanique des Solides, Université de Poitiers, France. The dynamic behavior of an elastic connecting-rod bearing is studied using an iterative method. Short bearing approxi- mation for Reynolds' equation and plane elasticity relations for the bearing housing are used for this study. The locus of the shaft center in the bearing is calcu- lated for the dynamic loading conditions of a connecting- rod bearing. Instantaneous elastic deformations and pressure distributions are given for different values of the load (or time). Variations of minimum film thickness, tor- que and flow rate versus shaft rotation are compared with those obtained for a rigid bearing housing and under the same dynamic conditions. 830308. (SP-539) Aluminum alloy bearings containing hard particles fitted for use with nodular cast iron shaft. Tatsuhiko Fukuoka, Hiromitsu Kato, and Soji Kamiya, Taiho Kogyo Co., Ltd.; and Norimune Soda, The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research. High tin and aluminum alloy bearings can seize easily when used with nodular cast iron shafts. The authors have in- vestigated the process of seizure between such nodular cast iron shafts and high tin and aluminum alloy bearings, and found that the seizures are normally caused by a combina- tion of burrs around the graphite at the surface of the nod- ular cast iron shafts and abrasive aluminum debris adhering to the shaft. In an attempt to remove the burrs and abrasive aluminum debris, the authors dispersed hard particles in the alloy bearings. The new alloy used has a chemical com- position of Al Si 3, Sn 10 and Pb 1.5 and, as a result bearings formed from it do not require a lead-based overlay. This arrangement provides much higher seizure resistance than overlayed copper and lead alloy bearings when used with nodular cast iron shafts. The bearings made with this alloy can be used in all engines with nodular cast iron shafts without any problems whatsoever. 1983 SAE Transactions 830309.

The paper describes the kinematic analysis of the cam/fol- lower contact in a valve gear design in which the valve is operated by a centrally pivoted follower. A novel feature of the analysis is that velocities are determined from the valve lift curve rather than the cam profile. The entraining veloc- ity at the cam/follower contact has been obtained and the 64</page><page sequence="46">830309-830314 variation of elastohydrodynamic film thickness over the op- erating cycle has been calculated. 830310. (SP-539) Running in of ground surfaces under elastohydrodynamic conditions. I. F. Bishop, Shell UK Exploration and Production, London; and R. W. Snidle, Department of Mechanical En- gineering and Energy Studies, University College, Cardiff. The paper describes the results of an experimental project on the running-in of circumferentially-ground steel discs operating under conditions of elastohydrodynamic lubrica- tion. The experiments were performed on a two-disc ma- chine in which the discs are loaded together in nominal line-contact. A special feature of the machine is the facility for obtaining surface profiles from the discs without the need for disturbing them during the course of an experi- ment in which they are run-in by incremental loading. Us- ing this facility it was possible to measure the disc surfaces at frequent intervals during a running-in test. Relocation profilometry was used to follow the devel- opment of individual surface profiles during running-in. The effect of running-in on various surface parameters was investigated using two different lubricants. The first lubri- cant was a medium viscosity mineral base-oil and the sec- ond lubricant was the same oil with a proprietary concen- trate of extreme pressure additive of the zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDTP) type. 830311. (SP-539) Contact-point method for measuring sliding face temperature and its applications. Yo- shihiko lida, Kazuyuki Tanaka, and Suguru Fuse, Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd. (Hiroshima, Japan). Recent years have seen much effort being expended to in- crease engine output while reducing engine volume, to achieve better fuel economy. In increasing engine output, the lubricating conditions of engine sliding areas come to be strict. It becomes important, therefore, to define the critical values of lubrication for ensuring engine reliability. In these aspects, a new method to measure piston tem- perature of the reciprocating engine was developed. This method employs a torsion coil spring as contact which sends out signals of piston temperatures. This contact has superior response and durability and being compact, makes it possible to take multi-channel measurement. In addition, it is demonstrated that this method for measuring sliding surface temperature permits evaluation of durability with con rod big end bearing and piston lateral face in a short time. 830312. Thermal barrier pistons and their effect on the performance of compound diesel engine cycles. F. J. Wallace, T. K. Kao, W. D. Alexander, A. Cole, and M. Tarabad, University of Bath U.K. The paper describes the basic design concept of a heat bar- rier piston comprising a Nimonic crown separated from the aluminium piston body by an air gap. Heat flow, tempera- ture and stress levels have been evaluated using a series of specially developed finite element programs. Preliminary experimental results obtained with the in- sulating piston on a Petter PHI W engine indicate a very substantial rise in exhaust temperature, coupled with con- siderable reduction in volumetric efficiency under naturally aspirated conditions. In a final theoretical section, the effects of insulated pistons and of insulated cylinder walls in general are dis- cussed both with respect to their effect on thermodynamic cycle parameters and to the possibility of substantial im- provements in thermal efficiency using the compounding principle. Final guide-lines are laid down for the most effec- tive use of thermal insulation in compounded Diesel en- gines. 830313. A low friction, unlubricated SiC diesel engine. S. Timoney, University College Dublin; and G. Flynn, Carborundum Resistant Materials Co. Structural ceramic components have been successfully op- erated in a diesel engine. The pistons, liner, and housing for an opposed piston, two-cycle (valveless) engine were fabri- cated from sintered alpha SiC. The ceramic engine was tested without any lubrication or cooling in the cylinder. Data was collected for both the motoring and firing tests for discussion. 830314. TACOM/Cummins adiabatic engine program. Walter Bryzik, US Army Tank- Automoti ve Command; and Roy Kamo, Cummins Engine Co. This paper discusses the goals, progress, and future plans of the TACOM/Cummins Adiabatic Engine Program. The Adiabatic Engine concept insulates the diesel combustion chamber with high temperature materials to allow hot oper- ation near an adiabatic operation condition. Additional power and improved efficiency derived from this concept occur because thermal energy, normally lost to the cooling and exhaust systems, is converted to useful power through the use of turbomachinery and high-temperature materials. Engine testing has repeatedly demonstrated the Adiabatic Engine to be the most fuel efficient engine in the world with multi-cylinder engine performance levels of 0.285 LB/BHP-HR (48% thermal efficiency) at 450 HP repre- sentative. Installation of an early version of the Adiabatic Engine within a military 5 ton truck has been completed, with initial vehicle evaluation successfully accomplished. Design and procurement of long lead time items for the next generation of Adiabatic Engine in the 600-750 HP power range is continuing. Work on the minimum-friction Adiabatic Engine version continues. 1983 SAE Transactions 65</page><page sequence="47">830315-830319 830315. Ceramies and the swing beam 2 stroke diesel for the automotive engine. J. V. Edwards, Sir W.G. Armstrong Whitworth and Co. (Engineers) Lim- ited (United Kingdom). Scaling down the conventional four stroke diesel engine to arrive at the small efficient engine needed for the economic automotive market, presents limitations, which are funda- mentally better overcome by the two stroke diesel. As design consultants specialising in the opposed pis- ton two stroke diesel, Armstrong Whitworth have many years of experience studying and developing small high speed diesel engines. In the truck sizes the two stroke has had many succ- esses, General Motors in the U.S.A. and the three litre Tilling Steven opposed piston engine in the U.K. are exam- ples. To meet the ever increasing demands on emissions and noise, however, the two stroke diesel has inherent limita- tions which have held back its use for the automotive appli- cation. The initial objectives of the Armstrong Whitworth Swing Beam Engine were directed towards overcoming these limitations. This engine layout was designed to create a low noise structure, arising from a balanced linkage sys- tem, other advantages of easy start and the potential use of low grade fuel derive from its variable compression ratio and slow piston motion near inner dead centre. Test results so far show that it has the potential for more advanced development. The developments in the application of ceramics to diesel engines could be a major advance for the small high output diesel engine. They are also seen as a possible major break-through for the opposed piston engine in two aspects - firstly because only the piston and liner will need making in ceramics - the absence of the cylinder head eliminates the difficult valve plate and port passage of the four stroke; secondly the potential to run without piston lubrication eliminates the problem of loss of oil in the ported liner. Low piston side thrust forces of the Swing Beam en- gine will benefit the unlubricated ceramic liner and also lends itself to introducing the short crosshead piston and piston rod-seals exclude crankcase oil from the cylinder. Ceramics will also extend the power range of this en- gine. Increased exhaust temperatures compensate for the lower efficiency of the small turbocharger and so reduce blower power and raise thermal efficiency. Developments are going on with quiet scavenge blow- ers and blowers utilising the flywheel which is seen as an- other important breakthrough for the two stroke diesel. Servo-operated fuel systems also have been run which would give injection characteristics well suited to the (DI) O.P. engine. 830316. The reduction of heat losses to the diesel engine cooling system. J. F. Tovell, Ricardo Consulting Engineers pic. The benefits of applying thermal insulation to the exhaust ports and combustion chamber components are predicted using a computer simulation of a highly rated turbocharged DI diesel truck engine. Comparisons are made between a standard engine and engines with the exhaust port, cylinder head, piston and cylinder liner insulated individually or in combination. The necessity of re-optimizing engine condi- tions when heat losses through the combustion chamber walls are significantly changed is also examined. The importance is recognized of developing techniques of reducing heat losses to the engine cooling system which can be applied at low cost and with minimal changes to existing engine designs. Potential methods of achieving these objectives are reviewed and their effectiveness as- sessed. This paper also describes the successful testing of a ceramic liner located in the exhaust duct of a diesel engine during more than 1000 hours of engine operation. 1983 SAE Transactions 830318. Toughened PSZ ceramics - their role as ad- vanced engine components. M. Marmach and D. Servent, Nilsen Sintered Products (Aust.) Pty Ltd., Northcote, Victoria, Australia; and R. H. J. Hannink, M. J. Murray, and M. V. Swain, CSI- RO, Division of Materials Science, Advanced Materials Laboratory, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Toughened partially stabilized zirconia (PSZ) ceramics possess a number of advantageous properties for advanced engine components, in particular for adiabatic engine sys- tems. Magnesia partially stabilized zirconia (Mg-PSZ), is one of the toughest ceramics yet developed also possessing excellent insulating, high strength, good thermal shock and wear resistance properties. In addition PSZ has a thermal expansion coefficient and elastic modulus similar to iron and steel. Over the last three years, it has been shown as a result of the combination of these thermal and mechanical properties, that Mg-PSZ is suitable for applications as var- ied as cylinder liners, valve guides, valve seats, piston caps, hot plates and tappet (cam follower) inserts. In non- automotive applications this material can be used in extru- sion dies, plastic moulding dies, powder metallurgical dies, dry conveyor bearings and prothesis implants. 830319.

This engine was all metallic without any coolant in the block and lower part of the heads. Ring/liner/lubricant system and thermal loading on the liner at top ring reversal (TRR) as well as on the piston are presented and discussed. Ring/liner wear is given as well as oil consumption and 66</page><page sequence="48">830319-830326 blow-by data during the endurance run. Another engine build with a different top ring coating and several lubricants suggested that a 1500 hours endurance run of MCE is achie- vable.

Optical data link for multiplex wiring. Nobuo Yumoto, Hirosaka Ikeda, Tetsuo Sugimoto, Kyozo Hayashi, and Fukuma Sakamoto, Sumi- tomo Electric Ind., Ltd., R&amp;D Group, Osaka, Japan. Optical data links have been developed for use in multiplex wiring harnesses. The links consist of optical fiber cords, optical connectors, and optical transceiver modules. They can be operated under severe environmental conditions in motor vehicles and, because they have wide dynamic range, sensitivity adjustment is not required. A heat-resistant optical fiber cord made of plastic has been developed to enable use at temperatures up to 80°C. Mass-producible, low cost optical connectors have also been developed. In optical transceiver modules, custom designed hybrid ICs are adopted for size reduction. These optical data links are already in use in the Toyota Century. 830321. CMOS gate arrays for automotive applications. Russ Knapp, Signetics Corp. A new CMOS gate array has been developed which features medium speed, wide operating voltages and a mature, very reliable CMOS process.

Wilson, Vehicle Instrumen- tation Design, International Harvester Co., Hinsdale, IL. The use of instrumentation on agricultural equipment slowly evolved from human observation of the operation of the equipment to a level of instrumentation which parallels that found on automobiles, and shared that automotive plateau for approximately 40 years. It has now embarked on a path which differs from that of the automobile. These differences are now openly competitive within the agricul- tural industry in both the choice of display technology and in function selection. This paper reviews both the early and modern agricultural instrumentation along with some of the unique functions now being monitored. 830323. Display concepts for agricultural vehicles. Peter Wright, Central Electronics Group, Massey- Ferguson Industries Limited. Agricultural vehicles have particular needs with respect to the design of their display systems that distinguish them from the requirements of automobiles. In addition to mak- ing the vehicle more driveable, and thus directly contribut- ing to the farmer's productivity, the display system plays an important role in reducing the farmer's costs in the event of a vehicle failure. This paper describes some of the special concepts that must be addressed in the design of display systems for mod- ern agricultural vehicles, and gives an indication of the current state-of-the-art. 830324. Automatic datalogging techniques for automotive applications. Craig White, Ford Motor Co. New instrumentation designs require extensive proveout in the vehicle environment. The sheer magnitude of informa- tion required to evaluate today's microprocessor-based systems precludes manual data collection and analysis. A method of automating the data collection process through direct communication with the instrumentation module is discussed. A design for an automatic data collector, or data- logger, is presented. 830325. Design requirements for opto-electronic clusters and possibilities for implementation. Klaus Neid- hard, Robert Bosch GmbH, Nuremberg, West Germany. Opto-electronic displays provide new possibilities for de- signing clusters. This does not only affect single display parameters, but may well lead to a new layout of the front console. Main components being a standard driver display and a centrally positioned informator. Whereas the driver display is only dedicated to actual driving data and does not contain any keyboard functions, the informator includes function selectors which can be activated by all passengers for getting multiple information regarding the complete automotive requirements. The optical performance of any future cluster is aiming at a TV-type display. Development stages are described how these require- ments can be achieved. 830326. Practical electric speedometer system for passen- ger car applications. David Taylor, Buick Motor Division, GMC; and Gary Thoman and Dale Maschino, AC Spark Plug Division, GMC. A digital implementation of an automotive electronic speed- ometer was developed to maintain the present analog poin- ter display while offering the advantages of increased accu- racy and stability, reduced size and weight, enhanced 67</page><page sequence="49">830326-830334 acoustical performance, and improved styling and design flexibility. System cost is minimized by using custom integrated circuits with conventional electromechanical device tech- nology. The speedometer is mechanized using an air core gage movement driven by digital electronics. The odometer is a conventional wheel display modified for stepper motor drive. Vehicle speed sensing is performed by a transmission mounted PM generator. This paper addresses design considerations and features of this system. 830327. Gagesite - computerized vision for automotive instrument calibration. Donald E. Lemke and David A. Langdon, AC Spark Plug Div., General Motors Corp., Flint, MI. A computer video imaging program called "Gagesite" has been developed which can automate the calibration process of automotive instruments in a fast and flexible manner. This paper looks inside "Gagesite" and how it is linked with machine controls and a statistical process control pro- gram to increase productivity and quality. 830328. Electronic instrumentation manufacturing - pre- conditioning experiences. Michael F. Aronow, Ford Motor Co., Electrical &amp; Electronics Div. Achieving acceptable field reliability with complex state-of- the-art automotive electronic instrumentation has led Ford Motor Company to pre-condition (burn-in) instrumentation modules during the manufacturing process. Since the 1980 model year, over 500,000 modules have been processed this way. This paper will summarize the pre-conditioning proc- ess and the lessons learned since 1980. 1983 SAE Transactions 830331. Modeling of flame propagation and energy con- version rates in SI engines. R. Maly, E. Wagner, and G. Ziegler, Institut für Physikalische Elek- tronik, University of Stuttgart. In this paper a thermal model for flame propagation in premixed homogeneous charges is developed which is based on real physical properties of engine and fuel. It is applied to engine cycle simulations of a model engine. The flame propagation model has been successfully used already to analyze ignition problems and engine knock. Here it will be shown that this flame propagation model is capable also of correctly predicting all the known dependencies of the cyl- inder pressure on fuel-air-ratio, compression ratio, spark timing, EGR, fuel properties, etc. which are observable on engines both with respect to magnitude and tendency of the corresponding changes. The results of extensive parametric studies with this model are presented along with details of the model calculation. The predictions are compared to real engine data taken both from established literature and from own engine work. From the very good agreement between predicted and measured dependencies it is concluded that the proposed model is a very useful tool for guiding re- search work. 830332. A comprehensive study of Wankel engine per- formance. R. Sierens and R. Baert, Laboratory of Machines and Construction of Machines, Univer- sity of Gent, Belgium; and D. E. Winterbone and P. C. Baruah, Mechanical Engineering Depart- ment, University of Manchester Institute of Science &amp; Technology, Manchester, England. An extensive experimental and analytical study of the per- formance of a Wankel engine is reported, with special em- phasis on the combustion process. A one dimensional tech- nique for calculating gas velocities in the combustion chamber under motoring conditions is described and this is then used to evaluate flame travel when combustion occurs. A novel three-zone combustion model is introduced. The effect of the position of the rotor recess is examined and shown to change the engine power output and hydrocarbon emissions. 830333. A thermodynamic simulation model for a metha- nol fueled spark ignition engine. H. B. Mathur, M. K. Gajendra Babu, and K. Subba Reddi, In- dian Institute of Technology, Delhi. A thermodynamic simulation model for the 4-stroke cycle of a single cylinder spark ignition engine operating on neat methanol is described in this paper. The development of the model for all the processes is illustrated. It computes the gas pressure, gas temperature and the rate of formation of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide at each crank angle using basic energy equation and reaction kinetic mechanism. A gas exchange model has been formulated by finite difference scheme to evaluate the mass flow rate through valves and the properties in the intake and exhaust systems. The vali- dation of the above model has been carried out by compar- ing the predicted and experimental data at different operat- ing conditions encompassing changes in fuel-air equivalence ratio, speed, load, spark timing and compression ratio. The special characteristics of methanol such as rapid burning rate, high power output and reduced nitric oxide emissions have been truthfully predicted by the model. 830334. The effect of chamber geometry on spark-ignition engine combustion. Stephen G. Poulos and John B. Heywood, Sloan Automotive Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The way in which combustion chamber geometry affects combustion in SI engines was studied using a quasi- dimensional cycle simulation. Calculations were performed to investigate the following questions: (i) the sensitivity of geometric effects on combustion to engine operating condi- tions; (ii) the differences in burn duration between ten chamber geometries and spark plug locations; and (iii) the relative merits of improved chamber design and amplified 68</page><page sequence="50">830334-830339 turbulence as means to reduce burn duration. The results from these studies are presented and discussed. 1983 SAE Transactions 830335. Combustion chamber effects on burn rates in a high swirl spark ignition engine. Richard C. Be- laire, George C. Davis, J. C. Kent, and Rodney J. Tabaczynski, Ford Motor Co. Experimental measurements of burn rates have been carried out in a single cylinder homogeneous charge engine. Three different combustion chambers were investigated (75% and 60% squish bowl-in-piston chambers and a disk chamber) using a cylinder head with a swirl producing intake port and near central spark location. Data were obtained with each combustion chamber as a function of spark timing, EGR, and load at 1500 RPM. The combustion rate is strongly influenced by chamber shape. The 10-90% burn durations of the 75% and 60% squish chambers are respectively about 40% and 60% that of the disk chamber. Chamber configuration had less effect on 0-10% burn duration. The disk had about 25% longer 0-10% burn time than the bowl-in-piston chambers. Modifications to the GESIM model enabled good overall agreement between predictions and experimental data, a rather severe test of the model because the coupling of fluid mechanics, combustion and chamber geometry must be properly modeled. An improved basic understand- ing of the influence of combustion chamber shape on burn rate has been achieved through the interactive use of experi- mental data and modeling. The results suggest that differ- ences in turbulence intensity and flame area development due to changes in chamber shape are responsible for the observed burn rate differences. 1983 SAE Transactions 830336. Combustion chamber design for improved per- formance and economy with high compression lean burn operation. D. L. Sutton, The Associ- ated Octel Company Limited, engine Laboratory. Further investigations of compact chamber high compres- sion lean burn gasoline engines performance were under- taken, and involved exploration of the possibility of improving engine knock resistance when operating at a compression ratio of 13:1. The studies show the importance of location of the combustion chamber in the cylinder head and the design concept to create a strong swirling air movement to provide high performance and efficiency. Comparison is made be- tween the basic low compression engine and the high com- pression designs, and economy and performance gains are demonstrated. 830337. Modes and measures of cyclic combustion varia- bility. Frederic A. Matekunas, Engine Research Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories. A single-cylinder engine with a transparent piston crown was tested with three intake geometries which produced different levels of swirl, and with two spark locations. A heat-release analysis was performed on the accumulated pressure-time data. Using this data base, relationships of maximum cycle pressure and its location in the cycle to the placement of the burn in the cycle are developed for differ- ent burning rates as a means of diagnosing sources of com- bustion variability. Among the significant observations were that com- bustion variability for operation away from the lean limit or incipient misfire is not strongly dependent on flow condi- tions at the spark plug and early flame behavior, but more dependent on the cyclic repeatability of the overall cylinder flow pattern. In the region of incipient misfire the early flame process becomes a significant source for variability. The onset of significant variability in IMEP corresponds to a condition where a collection of cycles shows the produc- tion of an increasing number of abnormally late burns as the spark is advanced. Additional spark advance results in the occurrence of misfire at approximately the frequency of the late-burn occurrence. 1983 SAE Transactions 830338. Experimental analysis of the initiation and devel- opment of part-load combustions in spark- ignition engines. A. Douaud and G. de Soete, Institut Français du Pétrole; and C. Henault, Div. of Eng. Res. and Testing, Renault. The low efficiency of spark-ignition engines at partial load is mainly due to non-optimum combustion. Investigation of such combustion shows that an initial phase must be distin- guished from the development phase. Unacceptable com- bustions may be of various types such as slow and/or late burning, misfire. An experimental method based on pressure-diagram acquisition and real-time cycle-to-cycle computer processing has been developed to characterize the effects of such combustions on engine-running efficiency and smoothness. The effects of the most significant parame- ters - ignition, combustion-chamber geometry, mixture turbulence and composition - have been investigated with various industrial combustion chambers, leading to guide- lines for optimization. To further the study of engines, fun- damental data on flame initiation have been obtained through laboratory experimentation using laser tomogra- phy. 1983 SAE Transactions 830339. Applying robot technology to the foundry in- dustry. Paul A. Van and Andrew Nowak, Fluid Air Components, Inc.; and David L. Harris, Dependable-Fordath, Inc. Specific foundry applications for a robot-based automation system are discussed. The design criteria of a robot for material handling, casting cleaning and metal pouring is 69</page><page sequence="51">830339-830347 established. A robot designed to meet the particular needs of the foundry industry is described. 830340. Establishment of automatic welding lines in the automotive industry. Kousuke Shiramizu, Yoshi- rou Awano, and Kenji Sakakibara, Toyota Motor Corp. Arc welding lines have many quality assurance processes which should rely upon manual work, but high efficiency could not be obtained even if welding robots are introduced alone. The authors developed a new welding torch and auto- matic tool exchanger system. Through these developments, doubled productivity and a thirty percent cost reduction could be attained compared with the previous arc welding robot lines. 1983 SAE Transactions 830341. Robot to solve Rubik's Cube®. F. R. Reich, R. D. Dyer, P. D. Bondurant, R. C. Kelley, J. S. Hartman, L. S. Dake, M. A. Lind, and S. D. Rosier, Battelle, Pacific Northwest Laboratories, Richland, WA. A compact, self-contained robot has been built for solving the three-dimensional Rubik's Cube® puzzle. This robot (designated the Cubot) system reads the color patterns from the scrambled cube faces, computes a puzzle solution and then manipulates the cube to return each cube face to a uniform color in less than three minutes. The vision system of the Cubot determines the face color patterns by reading the optical response with two color channels and then grouping the response vectors for the total cube using a nearest neighbor algorithm. A menu-type solution algo- rithm is then used to determine the sequence of moves that solves the puzzle. Two orthogonal manipulators, which grip the cube edges, then execute each move of this stored solu- tion and return each face of the cube to a single color. The Cubot demonstrates the potential of state-of-the-art tech- nology when color vision, adaptive intelligence and a manipulator with several degrees of freedom are integrated together. 830342. Application of acoustic intensity measurement to high frequency interior noise. Shuji Hata and Mutsumi Takahashi, Technology Development Div., Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd.; and Naomasa Utsunomiya and Hideaki Sakata, Testing &amp; Re- search Div., Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd. This paper describes the application of an acoustic intensity measurement method to high-frequency interior noise. Technical problems in applying an averaging technique via surface scanning to high-frequency interior noise were con- quered, and detailed quantitative contribution analysis of interior surfaces was made possible. Based on the analysis of a small passenger car, the effectiveness of additional noise control treatment can be roughly estimated, and an acoustic comfort of the car was improved by a minimum additional treatment required. 1 983 SAE Transactions 830344. Computer aided analysis system for noise and vibration on vehicles. Kunio Kanamaru, Tadaaki Kunieda, and Kazuo Eishima, Toyota Motor Corp. An analysis system for vehicle noise and vibration has been developed. It consists of minicomputer based analog proc- essing system connected with a large main-frame computer. This system features multi-modes for data analysis, fast data processing, data compatibility with conventional ana- log systems and feasibility. Fast data processing was achieved by newly developed FFT processor and minicom- puter software. A new remote control box makes it simple to operate. Data processed by the minicomputer can be transferred to a large main-frame computer for further analysis. 830346. Analytical study on engine noise caused by vibra- tion of the cylinder block and crankshaft. Takao Kubozuka, Yoshimasa Hayashi, Yoshikazu Hayakawa, and Kazuhiro Kikuchi, Vehicle Re- search Lab., Central Engineering Labs., Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. To clarify the mechanism of torsional and lateral bending vibration of the cylinder block which has a large affect on engine noise, an analysis was conducted of the influence of crankshaft torsional vibration on cylinder block vibrations. There were two main results. The first is that the lateral forced vibration of the crankshaft by the fluctuation of the lateral inertia force generated with the torsional vibration of the crankshaft directly causes the vibrations of the cylinder block. The other is that the level of cylinder block vibration varies according to the condition in which the frequency of the fluctuation of inertia force approaches the resonant fre- quencies of the cylinder block. Further, noise reduction can be achieved by optimizing the resonant frequency of the crankshaft torsional vibration. 1 983 SAE Transactions 830347. The Los Alamos fuel cell test program. H. S. Murray, R. E. Bobbett, D. K. Lynn, J. R. Huff, C. R. Derouin, and J. B. McCormick, Los Ala- mos National Lab., Los Alamos, NM. A description is given of the program at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for testing a state-of-the-art acid fuel cell system for automotive applications. The system comprises a fuel cell stack, fuel processing system, and the equipment necessary for stack cooling and system integration. The specific tests relevant to operation of the fuel cell power plant in a vehicular environment and the measurement system are described. The results of com- puter simulation studies are presented showing the pre- 70</page><page sequence="52">830347-830353 dieted performance of the test power plant in an electric vehicle. 830348. Technical and economic feasibility of a solid pol- ymer electrolyte fuel cell powerplant for automo- tive applications. Leonard J. Nuttall and James F. McElroy, General Electric Co., Wilmington, MA. Based on recent progress in the state-of-the-art of fuel cell technology a preliminary design study has recently been completed, which assessed the feasibility of using a solid polymer electrolyte fuel cell in an automotive application. Through the incorporation of several innovative system de- sign features, a powerplant design concept was achieved which met or exceeded the specification goals in all areas. In addition, avenues of development were identified which could result in significant reductions in the production costs of the fuel cell modules which could bring them into the range of economic viability. The system design concept is described, together with the economic analysis of the potential production costs for large quantity production rates. 830349. Advanced electric and hybrid vehicle subsystem assessment. Keith S. Hardy and John M. Langen- doen, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Insti- tute of Technology. Various candidates for nonpetroleum electric and hybrid vehicle (EHV) subsystems have been evaluated as part of the Advanced Vehicle (AV) Assessment at the Jet Propul- sion Laboratory. The subsystems include battery and power-peaking energy storage, heat engine and fuel cell energy conversion devices, motor/controller subsystems, transmissions, and vehicle subsystem (structure and body) technologies. The primary objective of this effort, was to project the mature capabilities of the various components in the 1990's for application in the systems evaluations in the next phase of this activity. This paper presents the basic characteristics of the subsystems and compares their capa- bilities with projected AV subsystem requirements. 830350. Roadway powered electric vehicle performance. Carl E. Walter and Jack D. Salisbury, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The performance of a roadway-powered electric vehicle system was determined by analysis and test. In this system, energy can be transferred efficiently from the roadway to the vehicle by inductive coupling across reasonably large air gaps. Higher frequency, flux density, and road current all improve power density and/or system efficiency. Use of the powered roadway by conventional vehicles is not compro- mised because drivability and thermal effects are small. No difficulties were uncovered which obviate the desirability of developing the powered roadway as a means to reduce de- pendence on petroleum. 830351. Simulated performance of solid polymer electro- lyte fuel-cell-powered vehicles. David K. Lynn, Hugh S. Murray, J. Byron McCormick, and James R. Huff, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM. Fuel cells offer a number of attractive features as alternate power sources for transportation applications. Potential ad- vantages include high efficiency, good performance opera- tion on nonpetroleum fuel and negligible pollution. General Electric (GE) assessed solid polymer electro- lyte (SPE) fuel cells specifically for automotive applications. The results of this assessment are used to calculate the performance and fuel consumption of the GM X Car and of the GE Chrysler Electric Test Vehicle 1 (ETV-1). The X car was calculated to have good performance, negligible emission, and substantially reduced energy consumption. The calculated performance of the ETV-1 with an SPE fuel cell is comparable to that of a present day, small gasoline- powered passenger car. In addition, the calculated fuel con- sumption is 33 mpg of methanol, equivalent to 66 mpg of gasoline on an energy basis. 830352. The evolution of engineering thermoplastics in automotive applications. Daniel C. Fuccella, Thermofil, Inc. The utilization of engineering thermoplastics in automotive applications has increased dramatically since a modest start in the early 1950's. Major application areas include elec- tronic, engine cooling fan and system components; head lamp and instrument panel retainers; and window lift mech- anisms. The evolution of engineering thermoplastics in auto- motive applications is traced through examination of these application areas. Projections of future evolutionary trends are presented based on anticipated application requirements and material performance potential. 830353. Evolution of polycarbonate for automotive appli- cations. Nelson R. Lazear, Mobay Chemical Cor- poration. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of polycarbonate resins for various automotive applications. To accomplish this the polycarbonate materials will be di- vided into three categories. The first part will discuss unmo- dified and reinforced polycarbonate; then binary blends of polycarbonate with other polymers will be treated and fi- nally some new polymer blends that provide significant property improvements will be described. Polycarbonate is a unique material that combines excellent impact strength, weatherability and heat resistance with transparency. Initial uses were based on these characteristics but there were also limitations. Stress cracking on exposure to some automotive fluids, reduced ductility at low temperatures and creep at elevated temperatures excluded polycarbonate from several exterior parts. These limiting characteristics can be over- 71</page><page sequence="53">830353 - 830363 come by reinforcement or blending with other polymers. Through these techniques the versatility of polycarbonate in meeting the varied automotive requirements has been in- creased. This will be demonstrated by examining several applications in more detail. 830354. The evolution of styrenie polymers in automotive applications. Kenneth J. Ritzema, Monsanto Co. Styrene-based polymers have been used widely in automo- tive applications for more than 25 years, and during the past few years, the styrenie family has undergone a dra- matic evolutionary change. With the downsizing of the automobile and the move to eliminate the painting of the plastic parts, new end-use requirements are being placed on the styrenie family. To meet these new performance re- quirements, old resins are being modified and new resins are being developed. 830355. PVC automotive applications. Donald P. Knechtges, B. F. Goodrich Co. The PVC, or vinyl, industry will continue to be an aggres- sive materials supplier to the automotive industry. Vinyl has played a substantial role in the industry for nearly 40 years. It has provided interior beauty, durability and utility. VinyFs weatherability and corrosion resistance have aided in protective exterior applications. Advances in vinyl tech- nology, particularly in processing advantages, will continue to improve the decorative and utilitarian value of PVC in the autos of the 1980s. 830356. The evolution of SMC in the automotive indus- try. James K. Reinker, The General Tire &amp; Rub- ber Co., Chemicals/Plastics/Industrial Products Group, Southfield, MI. Sheet Molding Compound (SMC) has been used in various automotive applications since the early 1970's. Providing such advantages as corrosion resistance, weight reduction, and part consolidation, this versatile material has seen in- creased usage in each succeeding year. This paper will re- view the early FRP processes leading up to the development of SMC, a description of the process, and a detailed review of major automotive applications. 830358. Production of high strength steels by continuous annealing. Ian F. Hughes, Inland Steel Research Laboratories. Inland's No. 3 Continuous Annealing Line will start up in the fall of 1983 and produce high strength steels with tensile strength from 50 ksi to 220 ksi. This paper presents an overview only of the scope and philosophy behind these three classes of products, namely HI-FORM, formable high strength steels with tensile strengths up to 100 ksi; DI- FORM, extra formable high strength steels with tensile strengths up to 140 ksi and MartlNsite, ultra high strength steels with tensile strengths from 160 to 220 ksi. A one side zinc rich paint coated HI-FORM and DI-FORM product is also described. 830359. Development of high-strength cold-rolled steel sheets for automotive use by continuous anneal- ing. Koichi Osawa, Takayoshi Shimomura, Ma- say uki Kinoshita, and Kazuo Matsudo, Technical Research Center, Nippon Kokan K.K.; and Koji Iwase, Fukuyama Works, Nippon Kokan K.K. High-strength cold-rolled steel sheets having tensile strength of from 350 to 1,500 MPa with a wide variety of features have been developed by using the continuous an- nealing process consisting of water-quenching system. Newly developed high-strength steels include dual-phase steels with high bake-hardenability, dual-phase steels with low yield ratio and excellent ductility, dual-phase steels with high deep drawability, ultra high-strength steels and extra deep drawing high-strength steels. This paper describes the metallurgical characteristics of the products of the continuous annealing process con- sisting of water-quenching system, processing conditions and mechanical properties of these high-strength steels, and their application to automobiles. 1983 SAE Transactions 830362. (SP-535) Pseudo-isostatic powder metallurgy densification process. Howard A. Kuhn, Univ. of Pittsburgh; and B. Lynn Ferguson, Deformation Control Technology. An alternative to hot isostatic pressing for powder consoli- dation is presented. The process involves axial compression of a hard granular medium surrounding the powder pre- form to be consolidated. The grain is trapped within a die so that axial compression produces lateral pressure as well. Thus, conventional forging presses and techniques may be used rather than the more expensive and time-consuming techniques of hot isostatic pressing. Experimental measure- ments have been performed on consolidation of 4650 steel powder cylinders. The resulting data on axial strain, lateral strain, densification and pressure provide the information necessary for process and preform design for actual compo- nents. 1983 SAE Transactions 830363. (SP-535) Forgeability evaluation of steel powder preforms. H. N. Tewari and R. Sharan, National Institute of Foundry &amp; Forge Technology, India. Forging of steel powder preform has aroused considerable interest in recent years in automobile industries for manu- facture of bearing races, connecting rods, pinion gears, etc. A component made this way can be heat treated to the strength level of wrought steel. It has much less fibering than a normal wrought material which results in better transverse properties leading to increased service life. 72</page><page sequence="54">830363 - 830373 The present paper reports the results of systematic in- vestigation on the influence of chromium &amp; molybdenum addition on the densification, forgeability and strength of low carbon steel powder preforms under varying compact- ing pressures. The work has also been carried out on a steel powder preform of composition En 351/353 produced from mixture of elemental powders. These steels find application in the manufacture of differential gears, gudgeon pin, pin- ion, etc for automotive industries. The percentage reduction in height till fracture during upset test on 150 ton hydraulic press was taken as criterion for evaluating forgeability. The die filling ability of the sintered compacts was also evaluated under varying compacting pressure. 830364. (SP-535) Quality assurance procedures for pow- der forged materials. W. Brian James, Product Development, Hoeganaes Corp., Riverton, NJ. The fatigue performance of powder forged parts can be better than that of similar components which have been cast or drop-forged. To achieve such properties, close control must be exercised over the powders from which the parts are fabricated and also over the process used to consolidate them. This paper discusses some of the property require- ments for powders intended for forging applications. Con- sideration is given to both the physical and chemical char- acteristics of the powders. Emphasis is placed on powder cleanliness and an automated image analysis technique for non-metallic inclusion assessment is described. Process control requirements during preform compac- tion and powder forging are also covered and a magnetic bridge sorting technique for assessing the microstructural integrity of the forgings is also outlined. 1 983 SAE Transactions 830365. Plated plastic automotive mirrors. James L. Ad- cock, Sheller-Globe Corp., Union City, IN. The use of chromium plated plastic for outside rearview mirror housings in the automotive industry is a relatively new concept. This paper discusses the engineering consider- ations necessary to successfully apply this technology to mirror applications, as well as some of the advantages of the technology in the areas of weight, ease of manufacturing, styling freedom, and cost. 830370. Vehicle electronics (Vetronics) implications for vehicle diagnostics. Donald S. Sarna, Anthony Comito, and Peter T. Walker, US Army Tank- Automotive Command, Research and Develop- ment Center. The problem of performing vehicle diagnostics during the past 10 years has grown in magnitude and has become even more difficult and sophisticated for Army Combat vehicles. Army combat vehicles have increased greatly in capability largely through the use of the ever expanding electronic and microcomputer technology. Through proper exploitation of the same technology, more efficient integration of the vehi- cle subsystems can be achieved to make possible built-in diagnostics. Built-in diagnostics must be part of the system design to provide a "fix forward" capability in the highly mobile and lethal battlefield of the future. 830371. Recent advancements in non-contact diesel diag- nostics. L. R. Armstrong and J. R. Wilkinson, RCA Automated Systems. Continual development efforts in non-contact and mini- mum contact test techniques have resulted in practical methods of over-coming diesel engine field test and diag- nostic problems. Available techniques can determine engine revolutions per minute, top dead center reference, turbo- charger condition, combustion chamber faults and fuel system faults. We have evaluated the current state-of-the- art available with RCA and elsewhere to define a fieldable non-contact test set. 830372. The advantages of the Isuzu square combustion chamber for D.I. engines. Ryoji Kihara, Yasuo Mikami, and Motoyasu Kinbara, Isuzu Motors Ltd. An appropriate configuration of square cavities shows two distinct characteristics when compared with the character- istics of the circular cavity. One is that the injection angle to the square cavity wall has some effect on reducing smoke level at low engine speeds and loses this effect with increas- ing engine speed. Secondly, the reduction in swirl at high engine speeds results in a better balance of swirl over the entire engine operating range. This allows best injection timing for BMEP to be retarded resulting in lower NOx and noise. 1983 SAE Transactions 830373. Elimination of combustion difficulties in a glow plug-assisted diesel engine operated with pure ethanol and water-ethanol mixtures. Tadashi Murayama, Noboru Miyamoto, Takemi Chikahi- sa, and Hideyuki Ogawa, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Hokkaido University. Forced ignition with glow plugs has great potential for the utilization of alcohol fuels in diesel engines. However, the installation of glow plugs may cause misfiring or knocking in parts of the operating range. This paper presents an analysis of the factors influencing the ignition characteris- tics of ethanol in a glow plug-assisted diesel engine; these factors may be classified into two categories: the factors related to the temperature history of the droplets before contact with the glow plug, and those related to the proba- bility of contact. By optimizing these factors, the combus- tion difficulties were successfully eliminated over the whole operating range, and engine performance comparable with conventional diesel operation was achieved. 73</page><page sequence="55">830374-830381 830374. An evaluation of unthrottled combustion system options for future fuels. J. R. Needham, S. R. Norris-Jones, and B. M. Cooper, Ricardo Con- sulting Engineers pic. Demand upon finite petroleum crude reserves is forcing various countries to examine alternatives. Within the USA liquid hydrocarbon fuels manufactured from coal and oil shale are envisaged. When considering such alternatives, the trade-offs between the production costs, fuel specifica- tions and the technical implications in use must be studied. This paper describes a programme of work examining the interaction between several fuel/light duty engine com- binations. Combustion systems covered indirect and direct injection diesel and spark ignited stratified charge. Fuels primarily covered D-2 diesel, naphtha and intermediate broad-cut blends. Low ignition quality diesel fuels were also addressed. The data obtained assists in the selection of candidate combustion systems for future fuel groups based upon base- line performance characteristics. Performance and environ- mental penalties as appropriate are also highlighted relative to each candidate. Further work areas for a fuller under- standing are also reviewed. 1983 SAE Transactions 830376. The effect of methanol/diesel fuel emulsions on the mixture formation in direct-injection diesel engines: a theory on spontaneous evaporation. Hans Josef Haepp and Hong-Son Truong, Daimler-Benz AG. Blendings of methanol and diesel fuel can only be produced in form of emulsions. The stability of those emulsions strongly depends on the concentration of surface active agents. It is shown that observed changes in mixture forma- tion of emulsions in comparison to pure diesel fuel condi- tions can be explained by a theory of spontaneous evapora- tion. Several feasible droplet models are discussed. Emulsion droplets evaporate spontaneously if the droplet temperature exceeds the superheating limit of the disperse phase. The superheating limit is only exceeded at the outer zone of the injection jet. 830377. Heavy-duty diesel emissions as a function of al- ternate fuels. Terry L. Ullman and Charles T. Hare, Southwest Research Institute, San Anto- nio, TX; and Thomas M. Baines, Environmental Protection Agency, Ann Arbor, MI. Emissions from a modern heavy-duty Diesel truck engine were characterized with five different fuels during transient and steady-state operation. A control fuel (Phillips D-2) was used for baseline emissions, and as base stock in three alternate fuel blends containing EDS or SRC-II middle distillates, or used lubricating oil. The fifth fuel tested was neat soybean oil, heated to 145°C. HC, CO, NOx, and par- ticulate emissions were similar for this engine on all fuels tested, with the exception of higher particulates for the soybean oil and higher NOx for the SRC-II blend. 1983 SAE Transactions 830379. Development of a higher boost turbocharged die- sel engine for better fuel economy in heavy ve- hicles. Takashi Suzuki, Akihiko Sato, and Koichi Suenaga, Hino Motors, Ltd. This paper presents technical solutions and a development process to accomplish not only superior fuel economy but also excellent driveability with a turbocharged diesel engine for heavy duty trucks. For better fuel economy, one of the basic considera- tions is how to decrease the friction losses of the engine itself while keeping the required horsepower and torque characteristics. A high boost turbocharged small engine offers this possibility, but it has serious disadvantages such as inferior low speed torque, poorer accelerating response, insufficient engine braking performance, and finally not always so good fuel consumption in the engine operating range away from the matching point between engine and turbocharger. These are not acceptable in complicated traffic condi- tions like those in Japan - a mixture of mountainous and hilly roads, city road with numerous traffic signals, and freeways. In order to overcome these shortages and obtain a better fuel economy, novel technologies were investigated and adapted to the engine. As a result of this earnest work, a new type of higher boost turbocharged diesel engine with an intercooler was completed. Numerous new technologies such as optimization of engine swept volume for a certain class of vehicle, variable controlled inertia charging system, turbocharger with ultra backward curved impeller, electronically controlled fuel in- jection timer (ET-Control) and guillotine type exhaust brake system, etc. were applied to this new engine. The newly developed truck with aerodynamic cabine in which this engine is installed shows 20-30 percent better fuel economy than its predecessors. 830381. The new International Harvester 6.9LD V-8 die- sel engine. J. J. Grinsteiner, R. A. Mueller, M. R. Zielke, and M. E. Zlock, International Harvester Co. - Engine Engineering. The new 6.9LD V8 diesel engine has been designed by International Harvester Company to meet the needs of the truck market, Class 2 through 6 GVW, and to provide light to medium duty diesel power to the OEM market at low cost. The complex requirements of these markets have been continuously monitored during the evolution of the new engine and the design has been updated accordingly. Sim- plicity of design, superior performance, reliability and dura- bility were the main optimization criteria. These have been 74</page><page sequence="56">830381 -830389 accomplished by closely coordinating the design, develop- ment, and manufacturing of the new product. This paper describes the concept of the new engine, the philosophy of design, the subsequent laboratory and field development testing, plus engine performance and durabil- ity data. 830382. On-board storage and home refueling options for natural gas vehicles. Amos Golovoy and Jacob Braslaw, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. In this paper options for on-board storage and home refuel- ing of natural gas vehicles are presented and discussed. The on-board natural gas storage options considered are: storage at 2.2 MPa (300 psig) in activated carbon-filled cylinders, and 7.0 MPa (1000 psig) and 16.7 MPa (2400 psig) in hollow cylinders. Information is presented on small home refueling compressors designed to compress the natural gas to the above mentioned storage pressures. Also shown are data on the density and energy density of natural gas at pressures up to 21 MPa (3000 psig). It is found that to achieve a range of 160 km (100 miles), a 12.7 km/L (30 mpg) vehicle requires 232, 170 and 62 liters (8.2, 6.0 and 2.2 ft3), respectively, of natural gas storage volume at the three pressures considered. A preliminary comparison of the three storage options suggests that storage above 7.0 MPa is preferred. 830383. Propane power for light duty vehicles: an over- view. Fred Hendren, Mobile Sources Division, Environment Canada. The result of the relatively little attention given to propane as an alternative fuel in the past decade has produced lim- ited developmental work on the conversion equipment. This contrasts the advancements that have occurred in automo- tive engine control technology. Discussion will focus on the impact of installing dated propane carburetion on state-of-the-art gasoline technology vehicles by investigating: 1. a "paper" survey of propane carburetion equipment; 2. three programs testing propane vehicles for: emis- sions, fuel consumption and performance; and, 3. cost analysis of the two fuels. To improve vehicle operating efficiency, it was found that better matching of the carburetion to the air-flow re- quirements of the engine was required. 1983 SAE Transactions 830384. Energy efficiency of oxygenates from their pro- duction to their engine use. A.-W. Preuss, VEBA OEL AG, West Germany. The paper focuses on the energetic evaluation of various oxygenates in comparison with crude oil derived gasoline. Data on the production efficiencies of alcohols and ethers are presented. The volumetric consumption of gasoline and the alternate oxygenate containing blends was measured during a standard driving cycle in a dynamometer test. The influence of the air/fuel ratio on the fuel economy was determined. It was found that the volumetric consumption of blends containing oxygenates was generally less than ex- pected by their lower heating values. The overall result shows equal consumption rates of gasoline and alternate blends. This energy gain may be used to pay completely for the higher energy requirement in the production of these components. Hence, no overall energy penalty results. 1983 SAE Transactions 830385. The use of surfactants in preventing phase sepa- ration of alcohol petroleum fuel mixtures. Earl J. Smith and Dale R. Jordan, XPCL Corp. A surfactant has been found that is effective in preventing phase separation of alcohol-petroleum fuel mixtures. It is described herein, along with the test procedures used to determine its effectiveness. These methods included expos- ing samples to the atmosphere until phase separation oc- curred; adding water to prepared samples maintained at a fixed temperature to induce phase separation; and cooling samples to achieve phase separation. Differences between "cloud point" and "phase separation point" are noted. Dif- ferences in performance between gasoline-alcohol mixtures and diesel fuel-alcohol mixtures are also examined and re- ported. 830386. Government requirements and voluntary stan- dards - international considerations. John A. Starkey, Automotive Safety Office, Ford Motor Company. National and international government requirements affect the design of motor vehicles and their components for each market area. If participation in market areas beyond the home territory is contemplated, planners and engineers should have an understanding of the process by which reg- ulations are developed and, also, what government appro- vals are required in order to sell their products in each of those markets. This paper is intended to give a brief overview of terms that must be understood, how governments develop and implement their requirements, and the role voluntary stan- dards play in the process. 830389. Color anodized aluminum automotive compo- nents. E. P. Short, Alean International Ltd., Ban- bury Laboratories, England; and D. Fern and W. M. Kellermann, Alean International Ltd., Kingston Laboratories, Canada. This paper outlines the process for the production of ANOLOK® finishes and compares it with alternative meth- ods of producing colored anodic finishes on aluminum. The properties of ANOLOK finishes are reviewed and results of accelerated and long term corrosion tests discussed. The 75</page><page sequence="57">830389 - 830398 practicalities of introducing the process into a typical bright anodizing line are considered. The economics of producing ANOLOK finishes along with alternative methods of producing colored finishes are outlined and desirable improvements to the process are identified. 830392. (SP-535) The effects of hydrogen on sulfur in ferrous compacts. John J. Kaiser, A. Thomas Sib- ley, and J. G. Marsden, Air Products and Chemi- cals, Inc., Allentown, PA. High hydrogen containing atmospheres, such as endother- mic gas and dissociated ammonia, effectively remove much of the sulfur that is added to ferrous compacts for machin- ability. Sulfur loss was found to decrease with lower hydro- gen concentrations in the atmosphere. The high hydrogen sulfide concentrations present with high hydrogen atmo- spheres will reduce the life expectancy of the metal compo- nents in the furnace. Low hydrogen concentrations in the atmosphere produce little hydrogen sulfide and expected belt and muffle life will significantly increase. Additions of water to the sintering atmosphere did not appear to have a significant effect on the sulfur content of the compacts. 1983 SAE Transactions 830393. (SP-535) Method of the preparation of high- density sintered alloys based on iron and copper. Kazuo Asaka, Tadao Hay asaka, and Shigeru Ozawa, Hitachi Powdered Metals Co. Ltd. It is an object of this report to provide a method of the preparation of a high-density sintered alloy composed mainly of iron and up to 50% by weight of copper, charac- terized in that it contains more than 0.03% of boron to suppress or limit the copper growth phenomenon during sintering. After carburizing, quenching and tempering, the sin- tered compacts composed of Fe-5Cu-0.15B-0.65Cr-0.1C show a tensile strength of 900 MPa at the density of 7.2g/cm3. As these sintered compacts show high elongation, it is possible to make parts by cold-forging using these mate- rials. After carburizing, quenching and tempering, the ten- sile strength of cold-forged compacts composed of the above mentioned material is more than 1200MPa. 1983 SAE Transactions 830395. (SP-535) Application of sinter-brazing. M. Ono- da, R. Kameda, and T. Koiso, Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. It is well-known that brazing of sintered parts is very diffi- cult because of absorption of molten brazing alloy into po- rous body. Our special brazing alloy has overcome this difficulty and made it possible to sinter and to joint two green com- pacts simultaneously in a sintering furnace. This sinter-brazing process enables us to make such a complicated parts as conventional P/M technics can not achieve. In this paper, two examples of automobile application of this sinter-brazed parts are discussed. One is the rotor of compressor for car-airconditioner, and the other is the side- plate of oil-pump for power-steering. The rotor has hollow groove inside to reduce its weight. The side-plate has complicated oil-tunnel in it. The sinter-brazing is most suitable manufacturing me- thod to make such complicated configuration as hollows and tunnels. Due to fixed dimension of green compacts, accuracy of assembled parts is better than that of parts assembled after sintering. 830396. Wire skeletonizing: principles and potential for automotive. Gordon D. Millar, Stelco Inc.; and John D. Collier, Cari-All Inc. Steel wire skeletons may be used in place of solid-mass forms such as stampings, castings and moldings. Skeleto- nizing with steel wire offers weight and cost savings and many functional improvements for parts and components. This paper provides design procedure and aids, examples and a list of automotive parts that could potentially benefit from steel wire skeletonization. 830397. Select strength steel bumper system. William J. Evans and Charles Haddad, Ford Motor Co. The SS Bumper is a new concept in automobile systems that achieves a very significant weight reduction in steel bumper construction and is capable of meeting the 5 mph FMVSS U.S. Government impact standard. It offers a low cost me- thod of achieving a double digit weight reduction with no cost premium for aluminum or plastic materials. This paper concentrates on describing the configuration of the SS Bumper and a simple, easy to apply procedure for car appli- cation which includes discrete equations for bending strengths, torsional strength and the new dent strength rela- tionships which have been recently developed. One version of the SS Bumper applied to the 1983 Thunderbird is also described. 830398. Design analysis and behavior of a variety of as- formed mild and high strength steel sheet mate- rials in large deflection bending. M. T. Vecchio, Advanced Body Engineering, Ford Motor Co. To develop design and application guidelines for a range of mild, high strength and dual phase steels with as received yields ranging from 27.5 to 108.4 ksi, a bending study was conducted for a series of capped hat section rails simulating vehicle underbody rail components. The combined effects of forming, die bias, section geometry and as received mate- rial yield strength are evaluated by assessing their effect on bending performance. Two material thicknesses are utilized to evaluate material performance. A third intermediate ma- 76</page><page sequence="58">830398 - 830407 terial gage is used to determine the combined effects of theo- retical stiffness and yield strength increase and gage reduc- tion. The bending data is analyzed to determine actual test component stiffness, peak load capability, overall test com- ponent deflection, concentrated load effects and buckling effects for the various materials and section configurations fabricated. Probable NVH interactions and their effects are briefly discussed. An attempt is also made to identify HSS material and forming characteristics which contribute to buckling behavior. 830399. Advances in designing ultra high strength steel bumper reinforcement beams. Bernard S. Levy, Inland Steel Co., Research Department. The use of M-190 MartlNsite for bumper reinforcement beams was first described in a 1979 SAE paper. Since that time, considerable progress has been made in proving its worth for such applications. The purpose of this paper is to document the additional information that has been obtained in the intervening years. 830400. Improved productivity in the business of molding small thermoplastic components. James A. Ennis, Packard Electric Division of General Motors. The reason for the inclusion of the word "business" in the title is self-explanatory. For us to be competitive in the world market, we must look at all aspects of the molding and thermoplastic components. We all know that molding involves more than pushing a cycle button. Packard Electric has several hundred molding ma- chines, and I would like to share with you an insight into our total operation, including the checks and balances used to mold a quality part at the lowest possible cost. The presentation will include our design, processing and validation of both to meet our customers' demands in a product. Then we will move into the production phase and discuss our receiving inspection of material, our manu- facturing process controls and final release mechanism for the distribution of product. I'm sure most of you are aware of the "parts" of the molding operation. You may not have the needs of a large molding shop, but, as Ackoff has proposed, the "parts" may not always be representative of the "whole". It is hoped that I will give you an understanding of the approach Packard takes to product, process and reliability to increase productivity. 830401. Productivity in the injection molding process. A. N. Gardner, Fisher Body - Syracuse Plant. Automotive injection molding is currently faced with tougher demands for low costs, higher quality and minimal inventory. The resulting transformation in the industry is summed up in the word "productivity". Items such as bulk systems, express mold set systems and robots are discussed as steps toward meeting the productivity goal. 830402. Computer aided manufacturing - injection mold- ing facility. August R. Zieliński, Cincinnati Mi- lacron. This paper will present a detailed look at the productivity formula and how the factors of productivity interact to produce the "CAM-IMF". These factors include people, materials, time, space, quantity, inventory, design, process, quality and technology. The machinery controls and technology will then be reviewed which will accomplish the Computer Aided Man- ufacturing Facility operating at zero inventory. 830403. Plastic product design optimization utilizing CAD/CAM. Michaelene Głowacz, Revere Mold &amp; Engineering. With an increasing demand for higher quality plastic prod- ucts brought to market faster, it is imperative that engineer- ing work closely with manufacturing to reduce the entire design/build cycle. The obvious solution would be to make these products more easily and efficiently manufacturable. Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing is one technique to provide the tools for improving all phases of product development, from initial concept to final man- ufacture, and result in products that are superior in quality and far more economical to bring to market. 830404. Tire uniformity improvement with the use of a bar code identification system. Eugene M. Persyn and Jack L. Bayonnet, The General Tire &amp; Rub- ber Co., Tire Division Quality Assurance. An automatic data acquisition system for collecting and summarizing tire uniformity data is explained. A bar code scanner is being added to this system to give detailed production information about each tire. This information will include the builder, the building machine and the curing press. 830406. Statistical aids for engineers. Wayne Wells, Ford Motor Co. Simple statistical aids, such as this computer program for calculating minimum sample sizes, can aid engineers in their decisions. Properly prepared, these statistical aids do not require the engineer to become a statistician. 830407. Inspection - automotive industry's endangered species. Jo Ann Goble, Chevrolet Prod. Assur., Chevrolet Div., GMC; and Gregory Gruska and Hansraj Bajaría, Multiface Inc. The Industrial Revolution and Management Science ap- proach paved the way for specialized departments. Among these came the Inspection Department, later the Quality Control Department, Quality Assurance Department, etc. However, the renewed interest in Quality, Productivity and Quality of Worklife emphasize elements that run counter to this approach. This paper describes the basic ingredients 77</page><page sequence="59">830407 - 830414 required for a successful transition and offers suggestions for further research. 830408. Reliability prediction and evaluation of elec- tronic devices, subassemblies, and systems for automotive applications. J. B. King, Ford Motor Company. An Electronics Subcommittee was formed within the Soci- ety of Automotive Engineers' Electronic Systems Com- mittee in October, 1978 to establish procedures for the pre- diction and evaluation of the reliability of electronic devices, subassemblies, and systems for automotive applica- tions. Objectives were established for the Subcommittee di- rected at improvements in Reliability Planning, Reliability Testing, and Reliability Verification. This paper will pre- sent some of the accomplishments achieved to date by the Subcommittee including the development of a viable relia- bility predictive model and operational factors affecting electronic components, subassemblies, and systems. Steps taken to resolve some of the issues associated with enhance- ment of current automotive reliability methodology will also be presented. 830409. Proposed reliability prediction method for elec- tronic modules in automotive applications. W. Binroth, Bendix, Troy, New York; W. Denson, Reliability Analysis Center, Rome, New York; and K. M. Hammer, Ford Motor Company. This paper discusses two models for predicting reliability for electronic modules in automotive applications. Both of these models were developed on data submitted by mem- bers of the Electronics Reliability Subcommittee of the SAE. The data base includes no military data (automotive data only) and in that sense the two models are new in the industry. The authors also present guidelines for use of both of the models as well as comments on results achieved by several subcommittee members when comparing the effec- tiveness of the models to available life data for several ex- ample modules. The format of the two models is similar to those used in MIL-HDBK-217, although these models lack in detail due to data base limitations. 1 983 SAE Transactions 830410. Quality improvement of igniter hybrid IC by us- ing FMEA. Fumiyoshi Matsumura, Osamu Oh- nishi, and Haruki Nagao, Nippon Electric Co., Ltd. This paper deals with the quality improvement of igniter hybrid IC by using the FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis). In the course of developing the igniter hybrid IC, we employed the FMEA method and thereby succeeded in developing a highly reliable hybrid IC with stabilized qual- ity. It was also proved that the forecast of failure mode by using the FMEA method is very accurate. 830411. The Ford Ranger light truck pin-rail disc brake spring - firmly compliant. R. W. Oltmanns, Automotive Control Systems Group - North America, The Bendix Corp. Brake system "feel" is influenced by numerous vehicle pa- rameters. The Ford Ranger sought to improve brake system feel over current light truck disc-drum systems by increas- ing caliper stiffness and reducing system feedback. The Ranger caliper is suspended by a unique pin-rail which firmly attaches the caliper assembly to the steering knuckle, yet provides controlled compliance to reduce brake feed- back. This paper describes the pin concept; its design and operation to achieve controlled caliper compliance. 830412. Brake integrated hydraulic actuation system master cylinder. Roscoe Nash, Jr., Ford Motor Co. This paper presents the design and operation of a new step- ped bore master cylinder (fast-fill) which also integrates the rear brake proportioning valves and brake failure warning device in one major assembly. This design optimizes weight, performance and package together with several unique de- sign features. It incorporates a combination of a plastic reservoir, permanent mold aluminum body, steel pistons, and minaturized steel proportioning valves resulting in a significant weight and cost reduction versus equivalent hy- draulic actuation systems. 1983 SAE Transactions 830413. Lightweight steel tube master cylinders. A. Yard- ley, Lucas Girling Limited. In order to produce an economical lightweight master cyl- inder, a unit has been developed which incorporates a thin walled steel tube as the basic component for the manufac- ture of the body. The range includes tandem cylinders of both conven- tional and shortened lengths together with single cylinders for use with clutch systems. Also included is a concept for producing nonmachined master cylinder pistons. 1983 SAE Transactions 830414. Development, status and future trends for hy- draulic brake boosters. Hans-Christof Klein, Alfred Teves GmbH. Hydraulic brake boosters will assume an increasingly im- portant role, as the need for power assistance independent of the vehicle's engine increases. Also, the combination of other functions, such as Anti Skid Actuation, Self-Leveling Suspensions, can lead to over- all cost effective systems. The paper covers the development background through duo-medium systems using steering pump as a power source to the latest single-medium high pressure H 21 system. The paper explains the compact integrated de- sign of the unit and concludes by considering middle- to 78</page><page sequence="60">830414-830421 long-term brake system development which would include a greater use of electronics. 830416. Measurment of piston and ring assembly friction instantaneous IMEP method. H. Mehmet Uras and Donald J. Patterson, The University of Mich- igan, Ann Arbor, MI. An experimental technique termed the Instantaneous IMEP Method has been developed to measure piston and ring assembly friction. The technique requires very accurate measurements of cylinder pressure, connecting rod force and calculation of inertial forces. Friction force is the differ- ence of these forces in consideration of the slide-crank ge- ometry. A grasshopper linkage has been used to transmit the connecting rod force signal measured by a strain gage bridge. Inertial forces have been calculated with the as- sumption of distributed connecting rod mass. The test en- gine was a Chevrolet 5 litre V-8, modified for single cylin- der operation. Piston and ring assembly friction has been determined under motoring conditions with and without compression as well as firing. Friction measurements have been made with SAE 30 and 50 grade oils at different tem- peratures. Boundary friction has been observed especially near top and bottom dead centers. To date the technique has been used only for low speed engine operation. 830417. Laser anemometry for engine flow studies. David Klick, K. A. Marko, D. J. Radzwion, and L. Rimai, Ford Motor Research, Dearborn, MI. Interferometrie laser anemometry was used to determine cycle-resolved velocity records within the cylinder of a labo- ratory engine. Direct recording of the signal enables two new types of information to be collected. For single seeds, two-dimensional projections of seed trajectory are measured to yield information about microscale turbulence. For mul- tiple seeds, continuous records of velocity versus time are found to contain velocity fluctuations on a smaller time scale than previously measured in an engine. A discussion of the simple apparatus will be presented, along with some suggestions for noninterferometric flow measurement. 830418. Estimation of fuel-air ratio from cylinder pressure in spark ignited engines. Paul K. Houpt and Stamatios K. Andreadakis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical En- gineering, and Sloan Automotive Laboratory, Cambridge, MA. A novel approach to the estimation of equivalence ratio in spark-ignited internal combustion engines is proposed, based on a certain cycle-by-cycle statistical analysis of indi- cated cylinder pressure data. A classical ("zero- dimensional") first law cylinder pressure thermodynamic model is re-parameterized into a difference equation in which crank-angle is the independent variable, and parame- ters in the combustion model are estimated from observa- tion of cylinder pressure alone. An efficient algorithm based on statistical maximum-likelihood techniques is derived to produce estimates of combustion duration, ignition delay, and total heat released on a cycle-by-cycle basis. It is then shown that the statistical signature of the estimated param- eters (combustion duration in particular) can be exploited to develop a Bayesian estimator for equivalence ratio. Ex- perimental results from a CFR engine are presented to- gether with potential simplifications to the required data processing requirements. 830419. Cycle resolved turbulence measurements in a ported engine with and without swirl. T.-M. Liou and D. A. Santavicca, Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Princeton University. Measurements are presented of mean velocity and of turbu- lence intensity, energy spectrum, time scales and length scales in a ported engine with flat head and piston, motored at 1200, 1800 and 2400 RPM both with and without swirl. The measurements were made using laser Doppler velo- cimetry at data rates which were sufficiently high to allow the mean velocity in each cycle to be determined which enables one to separate the cyclic fluctuations of the mean velocity from the turbulence. The turbulence measurements near top dead center both with and without swirl showed relatively homogene- ous turbulence intensity and time scales, approximately lin- ear scaling of the turbulence intensity with RPM, decreas- ing time scales with increasing RPM and a shift in the turbulent energy spectrum to higher frequencies with in- creasing RPM. With swirl however, 25% to 50% greater turbulence intensity, higher frequency content and smaller cyclic fluctuations in the mean velocity were found. 1983 SAE Transactions 830421. A fuel injection system for light economy cars. Robert J. Gayler, Piper FM Ltd. PIPER "PIJET" is a low cost microprocessor controlled fuelling system, that can be readily integrated into a total engine management package, for single or multi-cylinder engines to 150 BHP (112 KW). The system introduces fuel at the intake port of indi- vidual cylinders via air bled nozzles of unique design that assure good distribution by a process of "natural selection", from a single solenoid injector controlled, low pressure fuel supply. The nozzles may be represented as jets of a multi-jet carburettor and are designed to give a high degree of fuel atomisation at small throttle openings. Although the system is designed to run under micro- processor control, any failure of that control will result in a "fail-safe", emergency running mode. As with any downstream port fuelling system, full ad- vantage may be taken of the power and economy advan- tages of ram-tuned induction, together with the extensive use of plastics for system components. 1983 SAE Transactions 79</page><page sequence="61">830422 - 830428 830422. EFT for the 80's - a base model fuel control sys- tem. Frank A. Russo and Michael A. Pauwels, Bendix Corp., Engine Controls Div. When Renault and American Motors Corporation joined forces to introduce the 1983 Alliance, they decided to add one uniquely American feature, a highly responsive, low cost electronic fuel injection system. Bendix was selected to develop the fuel controls for the 1.4-liter engine utilizing an innovative single point system concept. The high precision fuel injection system makes the Alliance one of the most fuel efficient cars manufactured in America. With the Ben- dix system, the small engine produces solid performance and meets EPA emission standards with a relatively small catalytic converter. The Bendix system consists of a multi-processor elec- tronic control unit, a throttle body assembly including a single point injector, pressure regulator and an idle speed actuator, a low pressure fuel pump, a manifold pressure sensor, and two temperature sensors. Adaptive control, automatic idle speed regulation, and on-board diagnostics are some of the features that distinguish the system as an advanced engine control system. Modern digital electronic technology makes possible a base system that is easily adapted to a variety of vehicles. 830423. Toyota's new microprocessor based engine and transmission control system. Hironobu Ono, Jiro Nakano, Yoshiaki Nakano, and Yukiharu Taka- hashi, Toyota Motor Corp. Toyota introduced a new engine control system using a new microprocessor during the Fall of 1982. The new control system is used effectively for more complex application to engine and automatic transmission control. It controls air- fuel ratios in combination with the transmission shift con- trol to achieve good fuel economy, driveability, as well as emission reduction. This system includes a self diagnostic capability, in which the electronic control unit (ECU) diagnoses system abnormalities, stores them in the memory and turns on the CHECK ENGINE lamp. To assure the proper system op- eration against any failure of the processor, the electronic control unit has a back up circuit which executes the prede- termined operation of fuel injection and spark timing. For this system, a new 12-bit microprocessor capable of high speed real time processing was developed. 830424. Microcomputer - controlled engine management for the Audi Quattro. Ernst-Olav Pagel and Karl- Heinz Koehler, Audi NSU Auto Union AG, In- golstadt, Germany. In developing the turbocharged engine for the Audi Quat- tro, it became apparent at an early stage that this type of engine cannot be set up for maximum efficiency with con- ventional ignition systems. This is a result of the inflexibil- ity of the mechanical spark control devices: the parameters that can be registered to control ignition timing are rpm and load condition (manifold pressure) only. By employing a microprocessor-controlled ignition system, it is possible to feed the engine with an optimum ignition timing signal for all load conditions. 830425. A new metric for torque nonuniformity. William B. Ribbens, Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Univ. of Michigan. This paper presents a new metric for the nonuniformity of the torque random process of a reciprocating internal com- bustion engine. The proposed metric is derived from the torque 2N extrema which occur within each engine cycle for an N-cylinder engine. A 2N-dimensional vector is ob- tained for each cycle, which represents torque nonuniform- ity. The proposed metric is either the U or 12 norm for this vector. It is shown in this paper that this metric satisfies several properties which are desirable for quantitatively rep- resenting torque nonuniformity. Moreover, this metric is computed once each engine cycle and is, therefore, a quasi- real time measure of torque nonuniformity. This metric has several potential applications in electronic engine control systems. 1983 SAE Transactions 830427. A linearized model of engine torque and carbon monoxide emissions. Man-Feng Chang and Jef- frey A. Sell, General Motors Research Laborato- ries, Warren, MI. Recently, an infrared diode laser spectrometer was devel- oped which measures carbon monoxide (CO) exhaust emissions with a 25 ms response time. This rapid CO ana- lyzer and a torque transducer were used to study the dy- namic effects of air-fuel ratio perturbations about stoichi- ometry on CO emissions and engine torque. Linearized perturbation models expressed by transfer functions were obtained using frequency response techniques. The air-fuel ratio was perturbed around stoichiometry by varying either throttle position or fuel rate (via a modified Throttle Body Injection system) while holding the other parameter con- stant. Three speed-load points were studied in an engine dynamometer test cell to examine the effects of engine speed and load conditions on the structure and coefficients of the transfer functions. 1983 SAE Transactions 830428. Engine stability sensor. W. Mortara and C. Can- ta, Centro Ricerche Fiat. It has been proved from many studies and applications that, to improve fuel economy, is necessary to operate near lean limit without exceeding it, to avoid unstable engine running and resulting car surging. On this purpose, besides a precise and flexible control system, an engine stability sensor, to adopt closed loop control strategies, is needed. A research has been carried out on different measurement methodolo- gies with the aim of developing a reliable and low cost 80</page><page sequence="62">830428 - 830435 stability sensor to be used on production cars. For this rea- son sensors yet applied in automotive field, like accelerom- eter and pick-up or oriented to this application, like ring pressure sensors, have been used. As basis of comparison the cyclic dispersion, measured with a pressure sensor inside the combustion chamber, has been considered. 1983 SAE Transactions 830429. Optimization of engine controls using geometric programming. M. M. A. Dehghani and Hasan Sehitoglu, Louisiana State Univ. This paper deals with the development of a procedure to optimize engine fuel economy as a function of air-fuel ratio, spark advance, exhaust gas recirculation and air flow rate. The geometric programming method is used to determine optimum engine control settings when the solution is re- stricted by exhaust emissions or driveability constraints. This method is especially effective in fuel economy prob- lems, where the constraints are highly non-linear. Some example problems are presented to demonstrate the effi- ciency of the procedure. 830431. Buick Motor Division's new production engine test facility. W. E. Owen, Engine Plant, Buick Motor Div., General Motors Corp. The push for improved quality by the American automotive industry has taken many forms. Recent changes in technol- ogy have allowed advances in production engine testing that were not possible ten (10) years ago. This paper describes the background, concepts, test cycle, computer and mechanical technology necessary to bring Buick Motor Division's new production engine test facility to reality. It also describes the procedures only re- cently developed by which quality discrepancies can be more accurately diagnosed in order to allow quick and cor- rect repair of the discrepancy. 830432. A high-speed dynamometer developed to measure a small gas turbine engine's output. Shoji Sasaki, Toyota Motor Corp. This paper provides a description of a newly developed dynamometer capable of measuring torque at speeds up to 90,000 rpm. The development which has been made enables the dynamometer to measure output of a small single shaft gas turbine engine without a speed reducing gear box. The unit consists of a high speed generator to absorb the power and a torque measuring device. Since the generator is a key component of this dyna- mometer, a substantial portion of this paper is devoted to describing the configuration of the generator and the design considerations, as well as its performance. The rotational speed of turbomachines is gradually being increased and will be accelerated further as ceramic materials are introduced. The subjects to be discussed here will, hopefully, be of some use when a torque measuring device for speeds over 100,000 rpm becomes necessary. 830433. The use of micro-processor controls for durabil- ity testing. Matthew D. Byam, Schwitzer, Indian- apolis, IN. The extreme rotational speeds, temperatures and pressures required of turbochargers on modern diesel engines present increasingly difficult durability-related problems. To insure that the turbocharger will have a sufficient lifespan, each component; i.e., wheels, bearings, and housings must all undergo extensive durability testing. Due to the extremely long time periods required by this type of testing, an auto- matic, microprocessor-based, self-regulating test facility has become necessary. 830434. The effect of standard ambient conditions on the determination of vehicle road load and fuel econ- omy. Mike Love, Texas Transportation Institute, Texas A&amp;M University. A new set of standard conditions for the road coastdown procedure was established from the literature. The change in road load predicted from the road and dynamometer coastdown procedures was evaluated using this new set of conditions and the current set of conditions for a twenty four vehicle sample. These changes in road load were re- lated to changes in fuel economy using relationships pub- lished by the Environmental Protection Agency. No signifi- cant change in fuel economy was predicted when using the new conditions. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the new set of conditions with respect to road load. 830435. Predicting fuel consumption and emissions - transferring chassis dynamometer results to real driving conditions. H. C. Watson, E. E. Milkins, M. O. Preston, C. Chittleborough, and B. Alimo- radian, Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Melbourne. The models presented for predicting fuel consumption and emissions for vehicles driven on the road provide the means for averaging and storing results obtained from vehicle tests usually carried out at an emissions test facility to standard and non-standard drive schedules. For hot start fuel usage and emissions rates the models, in descending order of tem- poral or spatial resolving capability, include: transient en- gine mapping (a new model), steady state engine mapping, vehicle mapping, power demand, modal or elemental, lumped parameter (PKE-v) and travel time variants. The engine mapping model is shown to be able to predict instan- taneous on-road fuel consumption with good precision (±3ml) for one vehicle over a selected 3.3 km stretch of road. Its emissions rate predicting ability is less satisfactory. When link-by-link fuel is needed the 6 coefficient PKE-v model performs well (R = 0.994). The models can also be applied to transfer emissions and fuel consumption from one drive cycle to another. 1983 SAE Transactions 81</page><page sequence="63">830436-830448 830436. Techniques of measurement, variations and ef- fects of vehicle friction losses on electric dyna- mometers. Ward W. Wiers and Terry D. Hos- tetter, Advanced Product &amp; Manufacturing Engineering Staff, General Motors Corporation. Techniques were developed with the electric dynamometers to: 1. Measure vehicle dri veline and tire losses on the emission rolls; and 2. Establish the windage and friction settings required to match the dynamometer load to the actual road load or other desired load conditions. Vehicle driveline and tire losses were measured on 33 similar front wheel drive vehicles equipped with the same tire size. The total losses averagd 6.2 HP at 50 MPH and ranged from 4.8 to 8.4 with a standard deviation of .75 HP. With the standard dynamometer load used for the FTP test with that vehicle, the ± .75 HP represents an 11% change in load and about a 5% effect on fuel economy. The differ- ence between the maximum and minimum driveline and tire losses measured would result in a 27% change in load and an approximate 11% change in fuel economy. Tires accounted for the largest percentage of the total losses while the brake systems caused the greatest variations. Measurement of the vehicle losses and the ability to match the dynamometer to a desired load would allow test- ing all vehicles in a given program at the same load condi- tions. This would eliminate the effect of variations in losses when comparing the merits of various development designs and calibrations. 830437. Strategy for the development of a new multicom- ponent exhaust emissions measurement tech- nique. Joachim Staab, Horst Klingenberg, and Dieter Schürmann, Volks wagen werk AG (Ger- many). The effort in manpower and equipment and the expense in money and time involved in carrying out the various emis- sions tests have considerably increased over the past years. The same holds true for the fuel economy measurements. The present-day emissions testing practice calls for complex gas sampling and dilution systems (CVS) and for a big variety of different analyzing devices. The development of a unique instrument with which the interesting emission com- ponents can be measured simultaneously and directly be- hind the exhaust pipe would mean a decisive improvement of this situation. In an intensive study possible measure- ment methods were compared and a way was pointed-out to construct such an instrument. 1983 SAE Transactions 830442. Progress in British tracked vehicle suspension systems. Bruce Maclaurin, Military Vehicles &amp; Engineering Establishment, U.K. The higher power/weight ratios of modern tracked ar- moured vehicles has increased potential cross-country speed and placed greater demands on vehicle suspension systems. This has led to advances in component hardware and tech- niques for predicting and measuring suspension perform- ance. The paper describes the use of computer modelling for comparing the effects of different suspension character- istics and the use of concrete profiles including a 'random' profile course for measuring performance and validating models. Two modern tracked vehicle suspension systems are described - one torsion bar/rotary damper and the other hydrogas. Research work in progress on active sus- pensions and electronically controlled damping systems is also described. 830446. The development of a high performance diesel engine family for special applications. Franco Pi- nolini and Giovanni Biaggini, IVECO Diesel En- gine Division. In this paper the development of a high performance diesel engine family for special applications is described. Based on a range of truck diesel engines which are produced in large volumes, the high performance engines have been devel- oped utilizing the maximum number of parts of the truck engines. With 2.15 dm3 capacity per cylinder a power of up to 100 hp/cylinder (73.5 kW/cylinder) has been achieved. 830447. Creation of image on diesel spray and flame by means of Rapid Compression Machine and D.I. diesel engine. Shin Matsuoka, Tokyo Institute of Technology. The continuous series of images on diesel spray and flame were created through the studies by means of using Rapid Compression Machine and D.I. engine based on our latest data. 1. The image of diesel spray were elucidated through the study of thermodynamical global evaporation phenom- ena and the measurement of instantaneous distribution maps of spray fuel concentration by the high speed photo image analysis method at non-evaporated, evaporated states of free spray under the diesel condition at RCM. 2. The image of diesel flame were also obtained at the instantaneous distribution maps of temperature, soot and concentration of combustion products in the flame by means of photo image analysis method and gas sampling method at free and wall impinging spray flame with RCM and D.I. engine. 1983 SAE Transactions 830448. Diesel fuel spray penetration at high injection pressures. Keshav S. Varde and Daniel M. Popa, The Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Univ. of Michigan - Dearborn. To study diesel fuel spray behavior at high injection pressures, an experimental study was undertaken to investi- gate spray penetration and spray angles at constant injec- 82</page><page sequence="64">830448 - 830455 tion pressures. Fuel spray penetration and spray angles were found to depend on the injection pressure, density of the background gas, orifice dimensions, etc. A relation, based on non-dimensional parameters, is derived to predict diesel spray tip penetration. The calculated tip penetration is found to agree well with the experimental results. 1983 SAE Transactions 830449. Transient characteristics of fuel atomization and droplet size distribution in diesel fuel spray. Kii- chiro Takeuchi, Jiro Senda, and Masayuki Shi- kuya, Doshisha University. The purposes of this study are to clarify the atomization mechanism, the change over time in droplet size distribu- tion, and the change in spray characteristics dependent on back pressure on diesel fuel spray. Diesel spray injected into a quiescent gaseous environment under high pressure is observed by taking direct microscopic photographs varying the moment of exposure, the back pressure, and the ambi- ent density. The results show that the mechanism of spray atomization is divided into 4 processes, and spatial distri- bution of breakup droplets and a droplet volume rate are assessed for the whole spray region. Total and local distri- butions of droplet size are expressed by empirical equations as a function of time elapsed from the moment of injection. It is confirmed that the uniformity of the distribution, Sauter mean diameter of droplets, and droplet production rate change with time. Mean droplet diameter is further described in relation to the pressure drop and the ambient density. 830451. Investigation on the initial part and the spray formation delay of diesel spray. Jong-Yul Ha, Akira Hayashi, Hideaki Tanabe, and G. Takeshi Sato, Department of Mechanical Engrg., Keio Univ.; Hikaru Kuniyoshi, Faculty of Science and Technology, Tokyo Denki Univ.; and Hajime Fujimoto, Department of Mechanical Engrg., Mie Univ. As authors reported in SAE Trans. 800968, entitled "In- vestigation on the Characteristics of Diesel Fuel Spray", the flame never proceeds into the initial-part of the spray dur- ing injection. The length of the initial-part lies within 10 to 15 mm regardless of the conditions of the injection systems and of the ambient conditions. The ignition delay does not decrease but becomes constant when the ambient tempera- ture or the pressure exceed a discrete value. The authors would like to propose a new concept of "Spray Formation Delay" during which the field is gener- ated where the physical and chemical delay can exist. The spray formation delay is one of the major factors which control the above mentioned limitation of ignition delay. The characteristics of the spray formation delay are investigated and clarified. 830452. Laser anemometer measurements of the air mo- tion in the prechamber of an automotive diesel engine. D. R. Zimmerman, Detroit Diesel Allison Division, Indianapolis, IN. Laser anemometer measurements of the air velocity in the prechamber of an automotive diesel engine were made to verify/modify an analytical model of the fluid dynamics and thermodynamics of the combustion cycle. A special head was constructed to allow optical access to the prechamber volume. The service temperature of this modified head was limited, thus only motoring data was obtained. 830453. A universal test engine for combustion research. C. C. J. French, Ricardo Consulting Engineers pic, Bridge Works, Shoreham-by-Sea, Sussex, England. The original Ricardo E6 engine which has given good serv- ice over many years has been supplemented by the more versatile, high speed Hydra engine. The design offers con- siderable flexibility for incorporating variations in bore, stroke, and combustion chamber design - diesel, gasoline, and stratified charge. The paper describes the design of the standard Hydra engines and gives typical performance data in a number of builds. Specimen combustion photographs taken through a transparent piston crown are also given. The paper men- tions the problems arising from the alignment of the en- gine/dynamometer connecting shaft, and describes experi- ence with an improved blowby meter. 830454. Mass spectrometric determination of nitrogen oxides in turbocharged diesel engine exhaust. Jo- seph C. S. Lai, University of Queensland, De- partment of Mechanical Engineering; and Barry Wood, University of Queensland, Department of Chemistry. A mass spectrometer has been used to study the nitrogen oxides emissions from a diesel engine equipped with two different turbochargers. Methods of accounting for interfer- ence effects from other gases in the exhaust have been de- scribed. Results compare well with those obtained by a chemiluminescent analyzer in the trend of nitric oxide emission as a function of engine speed, with the emission level reaching a maximum at where the maximum torque occurs. Discrepancy is found in the absolute levels of nitric oxide between the results of the two instruments but overall agreement is reasonable. 830455. Particulate emissions from diesel engines - evaluation of measurement and results. K.-H. Lies, A. Postulka, and H. Gring, Volkswagen- werk AG, Germany. Since about four to five years car manufacturers are con- cerned with measurements of particulate matter in the die- sel exhaust gas and with possible measures to control and 83</page><page sequence="65">830455 - 830459 reduce these substances. This paper discusses the technical approaches to the problems of sampling and determination of the diesel particulates on a mass basis. In detail the paper includes 1) results from experiences with the instrumentation for sampling and weighing partic- ulate matter: manual sampling set-up, automatic sampling apparatus, filter holder, filter material, and microbalance; 2) results of the investigation of the main test parameters: sam- ple flow rate, background particulate level, filter condition- ing and efficiency. Further, a specific area of concern was the uncertainty of the measurements especially the variability and correla- tion of test results. The emission testing program, the basis of this study, comprised the determination of the particulate rates from a number of VW and Audi diesel vehicles with a displacement between 1.5 and 2.4 1 including 4-, 5-, and 6-cy Under en- gines. These measurements were performed on a chassis dynamometer in accordance with the specifications of three transient driving cycles including that used in emissions cer- tification, sulfate testing, and highway fuel economy. 830456. Distribution of fuel droplets, hydrocarbon and soot in diesel combustion chamber. Kiichiro Takeuchi, Jiro Senda, and Yoshiharu Ito, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Doshisha University; and Kozo Ishida, Analytical System Dept., Hori- ba, Ltd. Distribution of injected fuel droplets, total hydrocarbon concentration and soot concentration in the combustion chamber of a diesel engine with a swirl chamber have been measured microscopically with regard to the time and the space by means of optical method. As a result of this study, effect of the swirl flow on atomized droplet distribution, relation between the droplets and hydrocarbon concentra- tion, and relation between the change in concentration gra- dient of hydrocarbon with the time and the velocity of the swirl flow, and effect of non-luminous flame on the time of heat release rate raising period have been obtained. And from spatial distributions of hydrocarbon concentration, soot concentration, and local temperature in the combus- tion chamber at each time, the locational characteristics of soot generation are clarified. Further, effects of hydrocar- bon and local temperature on soot generation have been considered. 1983 SAE Transactions 830457. The effects of a porous ceramic particulate trap on the physical, chemical and biological character of diesel particulate emissions. Paul R. Miller, Jackson Scholl, Susan Bagley, David Leddy, and John H. Johnson, Michigan Technological Uni- versity. Physical, chemical, and biological characterization data for the particulate emissions from a Caterpillar 3208 diesel en- gine with and without Corning porous ceramic particulate traps are presented. Measurements made at EPA modes 3,4,5,9,10 and 1 1 include total hydrocarbon, oxides of nitro- gen and total particulate matter emissions including the solid fraction (SOL), soluble organic fraction (SOF) and sulfate fraction (S04). Chemical character was defined by fractionation of the SOF while biological character was defined by analysis of Ames Salmonella/ microsome bi- oassay data. The trap produced a wide range of total particulate reduction efficiencies (0-97%) depending on the character of the particulate. The chemical character of the SOF was significantly changed through the trap as was the biological character. The mutagenic specific activity of the SOF was generally increased through the trap but this was offset by a decrease in SOF mass emissions. Some extremely biologi- cally active subfractions were found at mode 4 with the Corning trap. NO2 emissions and HC emissions were gener- ally decreased through the trap. A computer performance model based on membrane filter theory was used to explain the solid particulate filter- ing efficiency data. The model showed how key variables influence particulate trapping efficiency. 1983 SAE Transactions 830458. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the partic- ulate emissions of three diesel engines. Karl- Heinz Zierock, Commission of the European Communities; and Gertrude Rothe and Regine Steppat, Technische Universität Berlin, West Germany. The concentrations of ten polycyclic aromatic hydrocar- bons (PAH) were analysed in the particulate emissions of a swirlchamber, direct injection and prechamber engine, re- spectively. The article describes the sampling and the ana- lytical procedure and discusses in detail the results measured at more than 23 different steady-state operating conditions. 830459. Occupant injury patterns in side impacts - a co- ordinated industry/government accident data analysis. Susan C. Partyka, U.S. Dept. of Trans- portation, National Highway Traffic Safety Ad- ministration; and Scott E. Rezabek, Ford Motor Co., Automotive Safety Office. The Accident Data Analysis Task Group of a coordinated government/industry project to develop and compare full- scale with subsystem side impact test procedures investi- gated four areas of side impact injuries. The Task Group ranked crash configuration modes; established injury cate- gories based on predominant body region injured and vehi- cle interior component contacted; investigated the relation- ship between these first and second impact variables; and discussed the role of structural integrity to occupant injury. 1983 SAE Transactions 84</page><page sequence="66">830460-830464 830460. What is a realistic lateral impact test? W. Reidel- bach and F. Zeidler, Daimler-Benz AG, Stutt- gart/Germany. From the Daimler-Benz accident investigation files, 222 side collision reports were selected and ranked according to injury severity of car occupants. Those collisions which caused serious to fatal injuries (AIS 3+-sample) were then analysed regarding direction of impact, mass and rigidity of impacting object, degree of injury risk attributed to the occupant seating position, and distribution of injuries over the body areas (head, thorax, pelvis). The findings on direc- tion and "rigidity" of impact support the proposal to con- tinue using the conventional rigid moving barrier but the injury distribution data underline the need to accelerate the development of improved anthropomorphic dummies suita- ble to simulate human kinematic characteristics. 830461. Conditions required to avoid being killed in cars in side impact. J. Y. Foret-Bruno, F. Hartemann, and C. Tarrière, Laboratoire de Physiologie et de Biomécanique Peugeot S.A./Renault (France); and C. Got, and A. Patel, I.R.B.A. Hôpital Raymond Poincaré (France). One studies the conditions in which occurred side impacts having led to death of 369 car occupants. This sample is representative of the population of fatal collisions having occurred on French roads, in 1980. 28% of killed were victims of collisions against another private car, 34% struck a fixed obstacle, 21% undergone a collision against a truck. The other types of collisions ac- count for 17%. The performances to be reached in order to spare an important number of victims are of a high level. This is measured in function of the distribution of impact violences and occupants' ages. Over the past ten years, the emphasis placed on protec- tion in frontal impacts has enabled improvement of safety levels in this accident configuration. In this respect, safety belts have played a decisive role. The seat-belt is recognized as dividing the risks in half. Further progress can still be achieved through improve- ments in the coupling of car passengers and through archi- tectural features that limit the risks of passenger- compartment-intrusion. For side impacts, the prospects are less open. The fol- lowing description of fatal side-impact collisions yields in- sight into the level of requirements that must be satisfied in order to protect a significant proportion of victims. It en- ables us to measure the challenge represented by protection against the risk of the occurrence of death in this kind of accident. 830462. Injury mechanisms to occupants restrained by three-point seat belts in side impacts. Dainius J. Dalmotas, Vehicle Systems, Road and Motor Ve- hicle Traffic Safety, Transport Canada. Drawing on field data gathered during the course of Transport Canada's Fully Restrained Occupant Study (FROS), the current limits of protection afforded vehicle occupants restrained by conventional three-point seat-belt assemblies in side impacts are examined. The sample under consideration comprises 98 restrained passenger vehicle oc- cupants involved either in a near side or a far side impact, each of whom sustained at least one injury at the AIS 2 or greater severity level (1976 AIS Dictionary). A detailed description of the pattern of injury to this subset of occu- pants and the damage sustained by the vehicle is presented. The principal mechanisms of injury for various body region groupings are discussed, with special attention being given to the incidence of side compartment intrusion. Other fac- tors influencing injury potential such as occupant age and vehicle size are also discussed. In the case of near side impacts, the data suggest the need for greater attention to be paid in vehicle design to the load path developed in vehicle-to-vehicle collisions so as to minimize the degree of lateral compartment intrusion. Measures aimed at increasing the degree of lateral restraint provided occupants in far side impacts also need to be ex- plored. Both subsets of the victim population would benefit from improvements in side door integrity and interior pad- ding. In comparison to frontal impacts, the mechanisms of injury in side impacts are more varied and complex. As- sessment of vehicle performance in lateral impacts may be difficult to realize through a single test on a complete vehi- cle. 1983 SAE Transactions 830463. Evaluation of full vehicle and component test procedures for improving side impact crash- survivability. Thomas F. MacLaughlin and Ro- nald J. Wasko, NHTSA/MVMA, Task Group. This paper reports the results of one of the tasks addressed in a coordinated NHTSA/MVMA side impact test proce- dure development program: the identification of specific tests which should be able to discriminate among vehicle designs having a significant effect on side impact injuries. Component and full vehicle crash tests addressing impacts between specific occupant body parts and vehicle regions are recommended for development. Advantages and disad- vantages of component vs. full vehicle tests are discussed and areas needing further research to support side impact test development are recommended. 1983 SAE Transactions 830464. European proposal for a side impact crash test procedure. Dominique Cesari, O.N.S.E.R.-Laboratoire des Chocs et de Biomécanique, Bron - (France). The European Experimental Vehicle Committee which in- cludes representatives of 6 European Countries (Federal Republic of Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Swe- den, United Kingdom) set up in 1980 a working group to 85</page><page sequence="67">830464-830469 propose on the basis of accidents studies and of test proce- dures evaluations, a standard test for side impact. Report of this working group, which is summarized here, analyzes the crash configurations and consequences of side impact acci- dents, discuss test methods for side impact, makes proposal for a standard side impact test using a mobile deformable barrier, and compares the characteristics of this barrier with other existing barriers. 830465. Sub-system and full system testing to assess side impact safety. Donald T. Willke and Dennis A. Guenther, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; and Michael W. Monk, National Highway Traf- fic Safety Administration, East Liberty, OH. A study is being conducted in which both component level and full scale crash tests are being compared. This report documents the approach selected for component level test- ing and the matrix selected for full scale crash testing. The hardware that was fabricated to conduct the component tests is shown and discussed. The component test results to date are discussed as to repeatability, durability and ability to discriminate between levels of safety. 830466. Some special analyses of thoracic protection in side impact. William Brubaker and John To- massoni, The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Upper torso injuries by the side interior surface of motor vehicles rank first in the injury categories for all non-ejected occupants of side damaged passenger cars in non-rollover accidents. In February 1982, a paper titled, "The Role of the Side of the Motor Vehicle in Crash Protection," dis- cussed the state-of-knowledge in thoracic protection known at that time. This paper updates the state-of-knowledge in thoracic protection and offers an expansion of the analytical approach section of that paper. Occupant responses in full scale crash tests are compared with computer simulations of the crashes. Response of the occupant to variations in his clearance with the side door interior are also examined. It is concluded that thoracic injury level could possibly be reduced by proper choice of padding characteristics. 830467. The measurement of impact forces under dy- namic crush using a drop tower test facility. Clif- ford C. Chou, Ford Motor Co. The design of structural components requires a knowledge of their crush characteristics, particularly the load-carrying capacity during dynamic crash. Although many attempts have been made to develop analytical techniques or meth- ods for predicting these characteristics, experimental tests are still needed to provide data for real structures for either development or validation. This report describes an experimental method for de- termining the force-deflection characteristics during dy- namic crush of square steel columns using a drop tower test facility. The custom-designed load cells were used for the measurements of the impact and the reaction forces at both ends of specimens, which were subjected to a 30 mph im- pact. Instrumentation for data acquisition and detailed data reduction for analysis are also presented. Dynamic force- deflection data are then verified through energy computa- tions of the total kinetic energy of the system and the resulting energy absorbed by the specimens, which are cal- culated from measured impact forces and dynamic deflec- tion. 830468. Impact analysis of two-vehicle collisions. Ray- mond M. Brach, Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, University of Notre Dame. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has conducted twelve staged collisions with the purpose of fur- nishing collision data for use with accident models. In this paper the data is fit to a two-vehicle impact model using the method of least squares. The model is based upon the equa- tions of impulse and momentum; the computed constants are the coefficients of restitution and equivalent coefficient of friction. A gradient search technique was used to mini- mize the sum of squares directly. Solutions (coefficients and velocity components) are found for 1 1 NHTSA collisions. The data seems to fit the model well, although deviations of 10% in impact velocity changes are not uncommon. Collisions with similar geome- try but different initial velocity magnitudes do not always result in similar values of coefficients of restitution and friction. A specific parameter involving the total initial mo- mentum, collision energy loss and velocity change, AV, of a single vehicle remains remarkably constant throughout all experimental collision types, speeds and vehicle mixes. This allows a simple expression to be used to predict approxi- mately the AV of either vehicle in any collision. 830469. An algorithm for determining the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) from records of head accelera- tion. Bernard E. Rodden and Timothy J. Bow- den, Defence and Civil Institute of Environmen- tal Medicine, Downsview, Ontario; and James K. Reichert, Manitoba Department of Economic Development, Winnipeg, Manitoba. An algorithm for calculating the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) from a digital record of the resultant head accelera- tion of a dummy used in impact testing is described. A result from Chou and Nyquist is used to establish a proce- dure for searching the range of time intervals within the acceleration pulse which should guarantee finding the true HIC . A second result from the same authors is used to make the search far more efficient for most head accelera- tion records. The algorithm is implemented in a simple way which does not require curve-fitting or interpolation be- tween the data points. This algorithm, implemented as a computer program, has been tested with head acceleration 86</page><page sequence="68">830469-830476 records from impact tests with dummies and some results are given. 830470. A practical statistical approach to set specifica- tions in car safety engineering. Magnus Koch and Anna Nilsson-Ehle, Automotive Safety Cen- tre, Volvo Car Corp., Gothenburg, Sweden. Safety specifications can be expressed by Market Require- ments which describe a performance that any car has to surpass. Alternatively there are the Engineering Specifica- tions which describe average performance for engineering and laboratory testing. A statistical procedure used for translation of the Mar- ket Requirements to the Engineering Specifications is de- scribed. It is a combination of engineering judgement and frequency distribution graphs, with confidence limits in- cluded. The procedure has been successfully used in design work on Volvo cars. Potential improvement areas of the method are listed. The method should be applicable to many products with narrow tolerances between Market Re- quirements and average product performance. 830471. Safety considerations for motorcycle helmet headphones. James C. Smith, Systems Technol- ogy, Inc., Hawthorne, CA; and David H. Weir, Dynamic Research Inc., Manhattan Beach, CA. In recent years, sophisticated audio systems have been in- stalled on touring motorcycles. One feature of these systems is the provision for headphones on or inside the safety hel- mets. With such an installation, the rider must still be able to perceive safety-related sounds, such as the siren of an emergency vehicle. This paper considers the spectral char- acteristics of sirens and ambient motorcycle noise, and the sound attenuation of helmets in general. This leads to the specification of characteristics for an audio filter which attenuates the program amplitude in the spectral region of a siren. The result permits the rider to hear a siren with adequate warning, yet maintains the desired high level of sound quality. 1983 SAE Transactions 830473. The vehicle entertainment system and human fac- tors considerations. Allen D. Krugler, Electrical and Electronics Division, Ford Motor Company. The vehicle entertainment system includes live or recorded program material, an encoding subsystem, transmitter, transmitting antenna, mobile receiving antenna, receiver/decoder, speakers, the vehicle environment, and the driver/passenger. Driver/passenger interaction with the system is very complex and not always well understood. This paper outlines some of these considerations. 830474. "Seat belt sweepstakes" - an incentive program. Terry D. Home and C. Thomas Terry, Automo- tive Safety Engineering, General Motors Corp. As part of an overall effort to support the National High- way Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) national program to increase seat belt usage, General Motors insti- tuted an employe seat belt use incentive program at the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan. This program was responsible for raising seat belt use at the Tech Center from 36% to 70% during its 5 1/2 month duration. The program was patterned, in part, after re- search work done by professor E. Scott Geller of the Vir- ginia Polytechnic Institute and State University under a grant from the General Motors Research Laboratories and a program conducted by Berg Electronics (a DuPont sub- sidiary). The intent of the program was to provide sufficient positive incentive to employes to buckle up for an extended period of time, thereby establishing a seat belt use habit that will continue after the incentives are no longer offered. This program was different from most other efforts to increase seat belt use in that prizes were available to participating individuals if, and only if, overall seat belt use on the site achieved a predetermined level. This paper presents the methodology and results of that program. 830475. An educational program for increased safety belt use for a small organization. V. Herbert Kauf- man, SAE. A program to increase the use of safety belts in motor vehicles by employees of a small organization was devel- oped by a staff committee. Using readily available mate- rials, the employees were surveyed via a written questio- nale, then checked for actual use at three different times. Overall use of safety belts increased from 20% to 55% among the employees. This was accomplished through an educational program and by providing proper feedback fol- lowing each survey or spot check. Lack of funds prohibited the program from using money or gifts as incentive for increased safety belt use. 830476.

The objective of this paper is to study the lean limit opera- tion of a spark ignited internal combustion engine. The aim is to reduce the combustion duration and cyclic variation in lean mixtures; both of which are sensitive to the initial stage of combustion. This work involves increasing the burning rate in lean mixtures by minimizing the ignition delay through the use of a multiple electrode spark plug that has a total gap length of 10.2 mm. 87</page><page sequence="69">830476-830482 The multiple electrode spark plug was tested on a single cylinder engine and its performance was compared with a conventional spark plug in the following areas: lean limit air-to-fuel ratio; CO, HC, and NO emissions; cyclic varia- tions; and combustion duration. 830477. Ignitability experiments in a fast burn, lean burn engine. R. W. Anderson and J. R. Asik, Ford Motor Co., Engineering and Research Staff. This paper demonstrates the first successful use of factorial statistical analysis in quantifying the effect of ignition sys- tem parameters on lean operation of a fast burn single cylin- der engine. Ignition parameters investigated include plug type, plug number, ignition system, plug location, and ground electrode orientation with respect to the mean swirl generated flow direction. System performance is quantified by analyzing the coefficient of variance of the peak cylinder pressure and the 0-10% mass fraction burn time for various parameter combinations. To confirm the results from the factorial analysis tech- nique, data from spark angle sweeps at constant flowrates are presented for the basic system and for two promising candidates that were selected from the factorial experi- ments. These candidates, a multi-ground electrode plug and a surface-air gap plug combined with more ignition energy, are shown to improve engine operation at lean gas-to-fuel ratio. Finally, a simplified thermodynamic engine model is utilized to predict what specific fuel consumption (ISFC) is attainable with stable operation at lean gas-to-fuel ratio. The value measured at the MBT + 1% ISFC level, using the surface-air gap plug and more ignition energy at about 22:1 gas-to-fuel ratio, is found to be within experimental error of the predicted value. 1983 SAE Transactions 830478. Prospects of ignition enhancement. R. Maly, B. Saggau, E. Wagner, and G. Ziegler, Institut fuer Physikalische Elektronik, University of Stuttgart. A simple thermal model for flame propagation is adapted to engine conditions and used to trace back engine parameters via computer simulations to basic physical properties. The competitive constraints imposed by piston motion on igni- tion and flame propagation are revealed and the principal possibilities investigated to relieve these constraints. Gen- eral criteria for enhanced ignition and flame propagation are given. The theoretical results are compared to extensive measured engine data showing an excellent agreement be- tween model predictions and easily measureable engine de- pendencies. By relating basic data to implicitly given engine properties the optimization of engine performance is sub- stantially facilitated. 1983 SAE Transactions 830479. A comparative study of plasma ignition systems. C. F. Edwards and A. K. Oppenheim, University of California, Berkeley, CA; and J. D. Dale, Uni- versity of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. Performance of an array of plasma ignition systems has been studied in a CFR engine. This included a standard spark plug, an extended spark plug, a surface discharge plug, and two plasma jet ignitors, one with open cavity and the other with cavity provided with a jet forming orifice. For all the tests the engine was run at a compression ratio of 8:1, a wide open throttle, and minimum for best torque (MBT) ignition timing. In this way specific information was obtained on igni- tion delay, duration of the exothermic combustion process, engine efficiency, and pollutant emissions. The study dem- onstrated the effect of various ignition systems on engine performance as the lean operating limit is approached. 830480. A new platinum tipped spark plug extends the lean misfire limit and useful life. Norihiko Naka- mura, Tatsuo Kobayashi, Masanori Hanaoka, and Noboru Takagi, Toyota Motor Corp. Higher compression ratio and lower air-fuel ratio tend to raise the required break down voltage. Various types of electrode configurations were examined. It was found that a very thin platinum plate attached to each electrode was effective in reducing the electrode wear. This newly devel- oped platinum tipped spark plug uses a small sized center electrode and an enlarged initial spark gap. The lean misfire limit and the torque fluctuation at partial load are improved with the platinum tipped spark plug. After a durability test, the break down voltage became lower due to the grained platinum surface. The spark gap was almost unchanged during an 80 thousand kilometer durability test run. 830481. Four years of experience with 4-wheel Antiskid Brake Systems (ABS). Heinz Leiber and Armin Czinczel, Robert Bosch GmbH, Stuttgart. Four years of experience with production line installed 4-wheel antiskid systems (ABS) in passenger cars were the motive for analyzing and evaluating the results and the experience gained. The performance, reliability and safety in case of malfunction are the most important reasons for the success of ABS. These points are dealt with and future improvements are outlined. 1983 SAE Transactions 830482. Rear brake lock-up control system of Mitsubishi Starion. Satohiko Yoneda, Passenger Car Engi- neering Center, Mitsubishi Motors Corp.; Yasuo Naitoh, Himeji Works, Mitsubishi Electric Corp.; and Hideo Kigoshi, Automotive Products Divi- sion, The Nippon Air Brake Corp. This paper describes a new type Rear Brake Lock-up Con- trol System which is mountd on MITSUBISHI STARION. This system meets all the requirements of the ECE R13, 88</page><page sequence="70">830482-830487 Annex 13, gives a high braking stability regardless of the road conditions, and minimizes the body vibration and the pulsative reaction on the brake pedal to achieve a comforta- ble feeling during the brake application. It would be ex- pected that the adoption of this system could contribute greatly to the reduction of car accidents caused by the rear wheel lock-up. 830483. The first compact 4-wheel anti-skid system with integral hydraulic booster. H.-W. Bleckmann, J. Burgdorf, H.-E. von Grünberg, K. Timtner, and L. Weise, Alfred Teves GmbH. The major step in promoting vehicle safety in the past dec- ade in undoubtedly the advances made in developing auto- matic anti-skid systems. The authors' company, Alfred Teves GmbH, has made a significant contribution with an intensive 12 year anti-skid program. After successful pres- entation of the Mk I System in the late 70's, further pro- gress led to the Mk II Anti-Skid System, which has at- tracted wide attention. It will see production in 1984 in advanced European vehicles. The main feature of this new system is its integral and highly compact design, using a single hydraulic medium, namely brake fluid. A hydraulic booster, master cylinder, energy supply with electro-pump and accumulator, and a solenoid valve block form the assembly. Another key element is the first passenger car use of microprocessors which double processing of all information and mutually check every step. These microprocessors are also highly adaptable to program changes, without affecting the hardware. This new Anti-Skid design has unique features which will set a standard for all future systems, especially as the demand for anti-skid spreads from today's upperclass ve- hicles to small and medium size vehicles, and the very sig- nificant safety advances are made available to the broadest range of the motoring public. 1983 SAE Transactions 830484. Performance of antilock brakes with simplified control technique. Makoto Satoh and Shuji Shi- raishi, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. The four-wheel controlling antilock brake system is consid- ered as an effective safety device because of its capability to help a driver to maintain vehicle stability and steerability during panic braking even on a slippery road surface. This report deals with a simplified control technique which simultaneously controls right and left wheels on each front or rear axle. Both front wheels are controlled in re- sponse to a signal from the front wheel with the least slip, while both rear wheels are controlled in response to a signal from the rear wheel that has the greatest slip. A series of tests proved that this technique ensures vehicle steering ability even during panic braking. On a gravel and other rough roads, this system provided shorter stopping distance compared to other four-wheel antilock systems. It has been generally assumed that stopping dis- tance extension on such roads is only one disadvantage of the four-wheel antilock brake system. 1983 SAE Transactions 830485. Unicoat, a technical innovation for eliminating off-line painting of plastics. Jack J. Bracco, Mo- bay Chemical Corporation; and Manfred Schoen- felder, Bayer AG. To meet the future acceptance and economic justification for expanded uses of RRIM and other thermoplastics, a new innovation for painting components on-line in automo- bile assembly plants is essential. A new coating technology, referred to as UNICOAT, based on two-component ali- phatic urethane chemistry, shows promise as a way of achieving the flexibility, hardness and weathering proper- ties for coatings over plastic and metal substrates. This can be accomplished when the components are painted simulta- neously and followed by oven baking just below the heat distortion temperature of the plastics. The unique chemistry of urethane coatings provides latitude in curing conditions that avoids problems associated with the heat distortion characteristics of many plastics. 830486. Advantages of a new HR-molding technology. R. Volland and H. M. Rothermel, Bayer AG, West Germany. The use of upholstery elements from flexible molded PU- foam is part of modern automotive constructions. In Eu- rope too, hot cure moldings are more and more replaced by HR-foam. Practically all European manufacturers take profit of the advantages given by the high pressure mixing principle like loss free injection and exact metering of all components. Together with the large scale introduction of full foam seats the tool construction has proved to be a key factor for profitable production. Based on these processing elements Bayer has devel- oped Bayfit®-systems and the know how for the production of seats and backs with defined areas of different hardness. These "dual hardness foams" fullfill the demand of many cardrivers for comfortable seats with improved lateral sup- port. The economical processing of those cushions and their advanced properties under special regard of the vibra- tion/dampening, ageing and fatigue behavior are the main theme of the paper. 1983 SAE Transactions 830487. Precision control effects on productivity of com- pression molding. Dennis H. Andersen and Ar- thur F. Lawrence, MTS Systems Corp. A precision compression molding press, the press controls, and mold temperature control are described. Controllability of the press motion, press force and the mold temperature have a significant impact on reduced cycle time, reduced material costs and reduced scrap in compression molding of 89</page><page sequence="71">830487-830495 "Class A" finish FRP structural panels.

Internal mold release - the next step forward in RIM productivity. Mark E. Cekoric, Ronald P. Taylor, and Charles E. Barrickman, Mobay Chemical Corporation. Internal mold release offers the potential for significant increases in the productivity of reaction injection molded polyurethanes. This paper discusses the requirements for internal release formulations, their economic advantages, and various approaches which are under development. Mathematical modelling indicates that approaches which provide around 20 moldings per application of external spray will offer a high percentage of the maximum possible productivity benefit that could be attained with no spray requirement. 830489. (SP-538) Atmospheric corrosion mechanisms of painted steel. John V. Standish, Armco Inc., Re- search Center - Middletown, OH. Electron microscopy and microprobe analysis were used to study the spread of corrosion beneath an acrylic paint film on steel. Corrosion initiates beneath the paint film in cre- vices formed by scribing. Corrosion spreads as the build up of corrosion products beneath the paint film drives a crack along the paint/substrate interface. The buildup of corro- sion products cause defects to form in the paint film. Phosp- hating reduces the corrosion rate by increasing the polymer/substrate adhesion and slowing down crack growth at the interface. The improved adhesion can be explained in terms of acid-base interactions between the polymer and substrate. Sulfur was identified in the corro- sion products of the one sample which was studied. The sulfur is presumed to be from atmospheric pollutants. 830491. (SP-538) Effects of galvanized steel defects on painted appearance of exposed panels. C. Belleau and D. K. Kelley, Metallurgical Engrg., Chrysler Corp. Base steel and coating defects in galvanized steel sheet, can produce new types of appearance defects in painted auto- motive stampings. A large proportion of them are "print through" caused by steel or coating defects during temper rolling or subsequent forming. Quality requirements are more stringent than that currently used for zinc coated products. 830492. (SP-538) Perforation corrosion at lapped and cold formed portions in cold rolled and galvanized sheet steels. S. Kobayashi and T. Irie, Research Lab., Kawasaki Steel Corp. (Chiba/Japan); and H. Takahashi, Osaka Branch, Nihon Parkerizing Co. Ltd. (Osaka/Japan). In order to prevent corrosive parts such as hood, trunklid, door and side sill in an automotive body from corrosion, a new perforation corrosion test to simulate the corrosion at lapped and cold formed portions was conducted on cold rolled, galvanized, and zinc rich primer coated steels. Anti-perforation of galvanized steels with zinc of 95 or 128 g/m2 and galvannealed steel with zinc-iron of 59 g/m2 is remarkably improved compared to cold rolled DDQ mild steel so that they decrease the reduction in thickness to about 1/2 or 1/3. Especially galvannealed steel showed the highest protectivity. On the other hand, effect of steel itself on perforation is also observed among three uncoated steels. The EDDQ high strength steel has excellent resistance. The reason can be attributed to low manganese content and lack of surface segregation of manganese due to short time continuous an- nealing. 830494. Automobile demand and the policy forecast. Bar- bara C. Richardson, The University of Michigan; and Christian H. van Schayk, Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States, Inc. Mathematical models of the automotive system play a val- uable role in forecasting and policy analysis, especially in the public sector. However, poor documentation, lack of adequate model evaluation and unfamiliarity with the data and structural limitations of models suggest the possibility of misuse in such policy applications as fuel economy stan- dards and regulatory impact assessments. Findings are il- lustrated by analysis of two models: the Wharton EFA Automobile Demand Model and the Sweeney Passenger Car Gasoline Demand Model. In addition, 40 world sector models and studies representing more than 75 countries are summarized. 1983 SAE Transactions 830495. Substrate/phosphate coating interaction via potentiodynamic measurements. James W. Davis and Mark Knaster, Amchem Products, Inc. The inherent metal quality, coupled with the metal surface condition prior to phosphating has been associated with the corrosion stability and adhesion characteristics of the subse- quent phosphated and painted surface. The corrosion and adhesion properties are usually determined via long-term tests; however, our investigation of the potentiodynamic behavior of the metal substrates and phosphated coatings have shown that these electrochemical measurements can provide possible failure-mode explanations exhibited by subsequent accelerated testing. Fundamental properties of 90</page><page sequence="72">830495 - 830504 phosphate coatings on Fe, Zn, and Al substrates have also been investigated via potentiodynamic measurements. Indi- cations of the reactivity of the different substrates with re- spect to ease of phosphateability may be derived via anodic and cathodic polarization measurements. Further, the ef- fects of variations in the phosphate processing conditions have been correlated to polarization measurements. Finally, the successful treatment of different substrates requires vari- ations in the chemical make-up of the phosphating bath, and a need for flexability in the chemical replenishment of the phosphating bath. 830497. The itron VFD with reverse view configuration. Hideo David Shimizu, Products Engineering Dept., Ise Electronics Corp., Ise, Mie, Japan. One of the disadvantages of the conventional Vacuum Fluo- rescent Display (VFD) is its relatively narrow viewing angle due to the construction in which phosphor display images are secluded in depth from the front face glass. However, to avoid display distortion and to make wider viewing angle, Ise Electronics Corporation has developed itron VFD with "Reverse View" configuration in consequence of new tech- nology establishment. This paper describes about construction, operating principle, characteristics and application of "Reverse View VFD". 830499. An approach to improved electroplated parts quality. Marcus A. Clarke, Jr. and Gordon G. Perrin, Ford Motor Co. The long term visual appearance of exterior chrome-plated parts is highly dependent on part design and supplier per- formance. The use of numerous complex designs coupled with the pressures of competition has caused a statistically high percentage of parts to be manufactured which do not fully meet customer expectations. A coordinated approach to improve supplier performance and simplification of part designs was required. A task force was established to ad- dress these issues in 1980 and desirable results were achieved. 830500. CAD, CAD/CAM, CAE and integrated systems - an overview. W. C. Hamann, Ford Motor Company. The development of numerical control, interactive com- puter graphics and finite element analysis has spawned an overabundance of new acronyms to describe the application of computers in the engineering and manufacturing envi- ronment. The purpose of this paper is to provide an over- view of these technologies and describe how greater produc- tivity improvement can be achieved via the synergistic benefits of integrating these diverse systems. Discussions will be based largely on the Ford Motor engineering and manufacturing environment which in- cludes not only the internally developed Ford graphics systems, but systems provided by every major turn-key graphics vendor. Evaluation of the Initial Graphics Ex- change Specification (IGES) and communication of com- puter graphics data to Ford suppliers will also be discussed. 1983 SAE Transactions 830501. Computer-aided synthesis and analysis of ma- chine elements. M. Y. Zarrugh and B. A. Goncer, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg. and Applied Me- chanics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. A computer-based package has been developed for the anal- ysis and synthesis of machine elements, such as linkages, cams, gears, bearings, transmission shafting, brakes and clutches and springs. The package can also be used for the design of an entire system containing a satisfactory combi- nation of basic elements. The major distinguishing aspects of this work are (1) the large variety of elements contained in one package which facilitates the design of systems of components, (2) simplicity of use, (3) complete interactivity with computer graphics and (4) ease of extending the pack- age to include new elements or to modify the selection procedures of existing elements. 830503. Computer graphics in engineering education. Rol- lin C. Dix, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chi- cago, IL. Productivity increase in mechanical design through the ap- plication of computers and, especially, computer graphics is today well recognized. The engineering schools are taking a variety of paths to education in this new discipline in which faculty have little experience. A set of minimum proficien- cies for ME graduates has been proposed and a consortium of colleges has begun developing educational materials in CAD/CAM. In the paper, the programs at several leading schools are described to illustrate current progress. 830504. Advanced Integrated Propulsion Systems (AIPS) for future Main Battle Tank (MBT). Herbert H. Dobbs and Paul C. Glance, US Army Tank Automotive Command. In August of 1982, the US Army Tank- Automoti ve Com- mand (TACOM), initiated the first phase of the Advanced Integrated Propulsion System (AIPS) program by awarding six design analysis contracts. The AIPS program is aimed at competitively developing and producing a power package for application to the future heavy combat vehicle weight class. This paper reviews the purpose, schedule, target goals, and acquisition strategy of the AIPS program. The AIPS development differs from past programs in several ways. Technically, the engine, transmission and other subsystems will be designed and developed together as a totally integrated propulsion system. With regard to management of the program, the Government is examining acquisition strategies with the intent of insuring competi- tion throughout all phases (research, development, and pro- duction) and achieving the simultaneous qualification of 91</page><page sequence="73">830504-830510 two production sources. The final acquisition strategy has yet to be determined. 830505. Uprate of Cummins V-903 diesel engine to 1000 bhp for military application. Larry D. Fox and John W. Black, Advanced Engines and Systems, Cummins Engine Company, Inc., Columbus, IN; Pierre French, Holset Engineering Co., Ltd., Huddersfield, England; and Ernest E. Schwarz, Propulsion Systems Div., U.S. Army TACOM, Warren, MI. A commercial truck engine normally rated at 350 bhp was upgraded to 1000 bhp for military application. The design approach used was increased engine speed, low compression ratio, high pressure turbocharging, after-cooling and turbo- compounding. This paper presents details of the performance analy- sis, engine modifications, and design and development of the new turbomachinery required. Results of engine test- work are also presented. 830506. A new hyperbar engine for ship propulsion. Th. Andre-Talamon, Société Hyperbar Diesel S.A. - France. This paper describes the details of realization and the test results of a new lOOOkW - 2500RPM - 21 liter Hyperbar engine developed and constructed for the propulsion of 60 tons coast guard ships, having two fixed pitch propellers. The torque characteristics of these engines ensure the ship to be propelled between 28 and 6 knots under contin- uous operation without overheating, smoke and fouling, and without using any auxiliary propulsion unit for slow cruising speed. The performances, including fuel consumption are re- ported under various operating conditions. 830507. Regenerative supercharging of four stroke inter- nal combustion engines. Giovanni Cerri, Instituto di Macchine e Tecnologie Meccaniche, Universita di Roma, Italy. A regenerative supercharging method has been studied and shows an improvement in four stroke engine performance. With this method the mechanical or pneumatic connection between the engine and the supercharger is removed and replaced by a thermal connection. The heat from the engine is converted into compression work by means of a suitable R.S. cycle and this process leads to an increase in power and efficiency. Regenerative supercharging has been compared with traditional turbocharging and the results are presented for some kinds of engines. 830508. Analysis of local pressures, surface temperatures and engine damages under knock conditions. W. Lee and H. J. Schaefer, Research and Develop- ment, Volkswagen werk AG, Germany. The mechanism of surface damage in the combustion cham- ber of Si-engines is still unknown. More agreement is found in the literature about the theory of knock as an uncontrol- led autoignited combustion with high flame velocities fol- lowed by pressure oscillations. Although there are many investigations dealing with engine damage, there is still a lack of detailed local information of pressure and tempera- ture histories in the damage zones of the combustion cham- ber. In this work four pressure transducers and nine film thermocouples were inserted in a single cylinder engine with Heron type production combustion chamber and high compression ratio. The data obtained from cylinder pressure and com- bustion chamber surface temperature traces were registered synchronously with the Volkswagen high-speed data acqui- sition system HDS and analyzed with an on-line computer. Surface damage development was studied on a four cylinder production engine under conditions similar to those of the single cylinder engine measurements. Further- more ideas how to avoid these damages are discussed. 1983 SAE Transactions 830509. Knock (detonation) control by engine combustion chamber shape. G. Benson, IBM, Rochester, MN; and E. A. Fletcher, T. E. Murphy, and H. C. Scherrer, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, University of Minnesota. A reduction of engine knock intensity is demonstrated by incorporation of a stepped piston top to provide an abrupt increase in flame front area in an ASTM-CFR octane rating engine. The conclusions are based on several different types of knock measurements. Three different piston designs were tested. Decreases in the knock intensity, the magnitude of the pressure oscillations following knock, of up to 40% were realized. The statistical nature of knock is shown to be somewhat different from a normal distribution. The data have more scatter, particularly toward the high side of the mean value. 830510. Octane number requirement survey of 1973-1981 Japanese model passenger cars. Yukio Baba, General Sekiyu K.K. We described the results of annual surveys for Octane Number requirement of Japanese model passenger cars dur- ing 1973-1981. In this period Octane Number requirements showed gradual decrease in both of the 50% and 90% car satisfac- tion levels up to 1978 model cars at 89.3 and 93.5 ON, but thereafter increased to 90.2 and 94.7 ON in 1981. High speed Octane Number requirements usually showed 3-4 ON less than the low speed Octane Number requirement, however, but in recent years the difference is getting smaller. 92</page><page sequence="74">830511 -830518 830511. Mixture maldistribution and aldehyde emission in an alcohol fueled S.I. engine. K. Subba Rao, Bimetal Bearings Ltd., Coimbatore-18, India; V. Ganesan and K. V. Gopalakrishnan, Indian Insti- tute of Technology, Madras-36, India; and B. S. Murthy, University of Santa Iara. This paper deals with the experimental results of two en- gines - one single cylinder RDH - CFR engine with variable compression ratio and the other a four cylinder variable speed automotive type engine. The single cylinder emission results are projected for multicylinder operation and for a fixed maldistribution symmetry. The results show that there is a reduction in NOx emissions due to maldistribu- tion where as UBF, CO and CH20 emissions are increased due to maldistribution. 830514. Florida exposure compared to different acceler- ated weathering tests for clear over color sys- tems. Herman-J. Drexler, BASF Farben &amp; Fasern AG/West Germany. Florida exposure compared to different accelerated weath- ering tests for clear over color systems. The weathering durability of the two-coat metallic system is very important. The influence of the solar radia- tion, humidity, temperature and clearcoat film thickness is explained. A comparison of different short weathering tests to Florida exposure in various clear-coat systems is presented. 830515. (SP-538) The development of high strength galva- nized steels for automotive applications. G. M. Smith, National Steel Corp., Product Application Center; G. A. Gronceski, National Steel Corp., Midwest Steel Div.; D. Aichbhaumik, National Steel Corp., Research and Development; and J. J. Brinsky, National Steel Corp., Weirton Steel Div. Results of a continuing program to develop a family of Cb-microalloyed high strength galvanized steels are de- scribed here. Laboratory and production data indicate that "in-line" annealed fully recrystallized sheet products having yield strengths ranging from 40 ksi (276 MPa) to 60 ksi (414 MPa) can be produced on selected galvanizing lines. Statistical analyses of production data for these steels indi- cate that the variation in mechanical properties from coil to coil is quite small. Sheet products having yield strengths ranging from 70 ksi (483 MPa) to 140 ksi (965 MPa) with limited ductility are over produced by recovery annealing. Pre-annealing followed by galvanizing is currently being used for such products. However, laboratory work shows that "in-line" recovery annealing should be successful for these products. Limited production of "in-line" recovery annealed 120 ksi (828 MPa) min. yield strength product supports these studies. Hot rolled high strength galvanized steels are also be- ing produced. These steels range in yield strength from 40 ksi (276 MPa) to over 80 ksi (552 MPa). Limited laboratory and production data indicate that galvanizing can cause either aging or simultaneous aging and softening depending on the annealing temperature. However, the effect upon tensile properties is minimal. The future for high strength galvanized steels looks bright because of the continuing emphasis on weight reduc- tion and corrosion protection by the major automobile pro- ducers. Continuing development and production efforts are expanding the variety of the various H.S. galvanized steel products aimed at meeting automotive demands. 830516. (SP-538) Galvanized coating effects in outer body panels. C. Belleau and D. K. Kelley, Metallurgi- cal Engrg., Chrysler Corp. The fabrication characteristics of galvanized steels require increased attention to parameters governing forming, weld- ing and painting. The structure and morphology of com- mon types of zinc coated steels are described and related to the behavior of the materials during processing. 830517. (SP-538) Galfan - a new zinc-alloy coated steel for automotive body use. D. C. Herrschaft and S. F. Radtke, International Lead Zinc Research Or- ganization, Inc.; and D. Coutsouradis and J. Pelerin, Centre de Recherches Métallurgiques, Liege, Belgium. A new corrosion-resistant coating system, known as Galfan, has been developed for steel sheet and wire. This alloy consists of eutectic zinc-5% aluminum plus a small addi- tion of mischmetal (&lt;0.1 %). It has demonstrated corrosion resistance more than twice that of conventional galvanized steel sheet or wire under similar conditions and similar coating thicknesses. The coating also has extremely good ductility under cold forming conditions and behaves com- parably to conventional galvanized steel sheet with respect to spot weldability and paintability. The bath operating temperature is slightly lower than required for conventional continuous galvanizing baths, providing maximum econ- omy in energy utilization and compatibility in coating high carbon steel spring wire. Conventional continuous galva- nizing lines of the Sendzimir, Selas or Heurtey type can be converted to Galfan coating with a nominal capital in- vestment, provided a cast iron or ceramic crucible is availa- ble. Recent research shows that Galfan may be adaptable to a Cook-Norteman continuous galvanizing line and to batch galvanizing. The development of this product fills a com- mercial need for a superior product with minimal changes in established conventional galvanizing processing methods. 830518.

Ichiro Kokubo, Shingo Nomura, Hirohiko Sakai, Mitsutoshi Sa- kaguchi, and Masatoshi Iwai, Kakogawa Works, Kobe Steel, Ltd. (Hy ogo/ Japan). 93</page><page sequence="75">830518-830525 A new double-layer electroplated steel sheet has been devel- oped. The steel sheet is composed of an upper Zn-Fe (80- 90%) alloy layer which has good paint adhesion and a lower Zn-Ni (10-15%) alloy layer which has good corrosion re- sistance. Paintability, corrosion resistance and workability of the steel sheet were investigated. This coated steel sheet was revealed to be suitable for the automobile use. 830519. (SP-538) "One-side aluminized steel sheet" de- velopment and properties of a new anti-corrosion material. Kiichiro Katayma, Nisshin Steel, Ichi- kawa R&amp;D Laboratory; and Toshiharu Kittaka, Yukio Uchida, and Yorimasa Mitani, Nisshin Steel, Hanshin R&amp;D Laboratory. Nisshin Steel Co., Ltd. has developed a new process for the production of a "one-side aluminized steel sheet". The process utilizes a double layer one-side "stop-off' coating to prevent the molten Al from adhering to the steel surface. The "Stop-off" coating is removed by simple mechanical brushing after hot dipping. The characteristics of this product by above mentioned process are: 1) the steel side was as clean as a conventional cold rolled surface and showed no trace of the "stop-ofF' layer. Thereby, phosphating and ED painting were per- formed. 2) In the salt spray test data was obtained from zinc and Al coated steel surfaces; the coatings on both surfaces being of equal thickness. The length of time it took to corrode 30% of the samples' surface was determined and it was found that the Al surface lasted three times longer than the zinc surface. 3) By selecting the lapping type weld condition, after 5,000 spot welds the one-side Aluminized steel sheet did not show a drop in shear strength. 830520. Magnesium: an automotive perspective. Frank Carson, Ford Motor Co., Car Engineering. Vehicle weight reduction accelerated in importance follow- ing the 1973 oil crisis. The Ford Motor Company reduced average vehicle weight by approximately 1000 pounds be- tween 1975 and 1980 through downsizing, design efficien- cies and material substitutions. This emphasis on vehicle downsizing and weight re- duction has provided an opportunity to evaluate magne- sium against conventional U.S. automotive materials. This paper describes magnesium's advantages and disadvantages for automotive and assesses its future role in weight reduc- tion. Magnesium's potential is analyzed from a business standpoint including cost/supply, technical and timing issues. 830521. Magnesium for automotive applications - a state- of-the-art assessment. William K. Miller and Ed- ward F. Ryntz, Jr., General Motors Research Laboratories. This paper provides an assessment of many factors which will be important in the successful use of magnesium in automotive components. Included in this comprehensive and extensively documented review are the subjects of mag- nesium availability, price, energy requirements, properties, manufacturing processes, safety and applications. Potential advantages and problems are highlighted with the hope that this information will aid in the selection and development of components which best utilize the unique characteristics of this lightweight metal. 1983 SAE Transactions 830523.

To aid in better assessing the corrosion performance of AZ91 die cast magnesium, standard salt spray corrosion tests have been made on both randomly selected commer- cial die castings and on three series of controlled purity test panels. The results reveal that the poor performance often associated with magnesium parts in salt spray are due prin- cipally to iron, nickel, and copper contamination levels. When these contaminants were limited, severe pitting cor- rosion was eliminated and the salt spray performance was good to excellent when compared to 380 aluminum and cold rolled steel. 1983 SAE Transactions 830524. Arc cleaning for joining aluminum. James M. O'Brien and W. Jack Titus, Midland-Ross Corp. The advantages of oxide removal prior to resistance spot welding mill-finish aluminum sheet are well documented. The process of localized oxide removal through the sputter- ing action of a plasma arc has been integrated into a spot welding cycle at rates compatible with most automotive processes. The resulting process provides a low electrode- sheet interface resistance, having profound effects on elec- trode life and weld quality consistency. 830525. Pulsed arc welding. Rainer Uhlig, ESAB Robotic Welding Division. Pulsed arc welding is one of the new processes finding many applications throughout a whole range of industries. The process, which is like metal inert gas welding (MIG), pro- duces a quality akin to tungsten inert gas welding (TIG) with consumable electrodes. The pulsed process is three to four times faster than the TIG process. Essentially, the equipment is similar to MIG welding; however, the shielding gases used are normally argon or an argon mixture. The pulsed process can be used for all- position welding of ferrous and non-ferrous materials. A distinguishing feature of the process is that large wire diameters can be operated at low welding currents. This means the cost of welding wire will be reduced (com- pared to standard MIG welding) and the problem of push- ing aluminum wire through long conduits will be solved. 94</page><page sequence="76">830525 - 830530 The origin of the process is somewhat confusing; there are a number of patents on the process originating from the U.S. and England. Of historical importance are the com- bined studies of the electrical arc and power source design to precisely control the metal transfer in MIG welding. The Welding Institute of England has carried out considerable research into the studies of metal transfer in the arc. The importance of their work is largely the reason why the proc- ess has been introduced into the industry. 830526. Self-piercing rivets for aluminum components. Stephen P. Sunday, Reynolds Metals Co. Recent trends in the automotive industry toward improving fuel economy have led to the conversion of many steel applications to aluminum. The use of aluminum reduces vehicle weight while allowing the automaker to continue to use traditional fabricating methods. The primary joining technique used for steel sheet components has been resist- ance spot welding. While this technique is currently used to join many aluminum components, automakers are reluctant to specify this joining technique due to capital equipment cost, electrode tip life, or reliability concerns. Several alternate joining techniques have been investi- gated and used. These include adhesive bonding, weld bonding, resistance welding with arc cleaning, GMA spot welding, clinching, and riveting. Recently, a method of riv- eting components without prepunching or predrilling holes has generated a large amount of interest. This paper is a review of this riveting technique. Data is included for com- parisons to resistance spot welded joints. 830527. Strategy for a fail-safe electronic diesel control system for passenger cars. Gerhard Stumpp and Hermann Kull, Robert Bosch GmbH (Stutt- gart/West Germany). Mechanical control systems for diesel engines are reliable and exhibit a low failure rate. However, rising demands for improved functional characteristics and closer tolerances require electronic diesel control. The electronic diesel con- trol (EDC) offers functional advantages over mechanical controls. In order to obtain a fail-safe systems it is necessary to detect defects in sensors, in the digital processor, in actua- tors and in the overall system. The failure of exhaust gas recirculation is uncritical, the failure of start of injection control needs counter-measures to avoid a damage of the engine. Without countermeasures fuel delivery control fail- ure may lead to safety risk. All required countermeasures will be explained in detail. 830528. The performance advantages of electronic control diesel engine for passenger cars. Ryoji Kihara, Yasuo Mikami, and Hirohide Nakao, Isuzu Mo- tors Limited. The diesel engine with a electronic control system which has been used in production passenger cars in Isuzu shows great advantages such as fuel economy, idle noise, cold startability and output performance by the help of the new commet V combustion chamber design. The new combus- tion chamber which differs in shape and throat area from the conventional commet V has been developed to be well matched to the electronic control system. The passenger car equipped with the electronic control diesel engine mentioned above provides the following four additional advantages: 1. Good acceleration response 2. Idle speed control which is affected by engine cool- ant temperature, on-ofif of the air conditioning compressor and battery voltage 3. Cruise control 4. Self-diagnostic system 830529. GA 1 - glider automatic. Peter Hofbauer, Gerd A. Oberpichler, and Klaus Sendzik, Volkswagen- werk, AG. Fuel consumption and emissions are reduced through the use of an engine/transmission management system, which prevents unnecessary engine operation. The system is de- scribed on a subcompact car with Diesel engine and econ- omy manual transmission. During vehicle deceleration and idle modes (accelerator pedal not depressed) power trans- mission from the engine is interrupted and the engine is shut off. The engine is operating and power transmission to the wheels is provided only when driving force is required that means when the transmission is in gear and the accelerator pedal is depressed. The interruption and the engagement of power trans- mission is accomplished by an automatic clutch actuator. Monitoring and control of all system functions is ac- complished by a microprocessor. 1983 SAE Transactions 830530. Disc brake squeal. James H. Tarter, Automotive Materials Technology Center, The Bendix Corp. Theories which have been proposed as an explanation of brake squeal are reviewed. It is now thought that disc brake squeal is best explained by modeling the brake as a multi- degree of freedom spring-mass system which may be stable or unstable depending on the values of its parameters. A method of testing disc brakes to measure squeal is described. Test results show that squeal is eliminated if the rotor is slotted. Test results also show that changes in fric- tion material and pad contact geometry can have a signifi- cant effect. It is concluded that the elimination of disc brake squeal will require both better matching of the friction ma- terial to the brake, and improvements in the design of the brake. 95</page><page sequence="77">830531 -830537 830531. Laboratory and vehicle characterization of front disc brake squeal. William J. Bracken and Johnny K. Sakioka, Jr., Ford Motor Co. A drag test method for the quantification of front disc brake squeal which uses a brake dynamometer and noise analysis equipment was developed and previously reported in SAE Paper 820037. Subsequently, the dynamometer pro- cedure was revised to a variable stop method which allows a wider study range in less test time while still providing sufficient information to determine the noise character in- fluence of design changes. In conjunction with this revised dynamometer operation, a systematic vehicle test procedure was developed to more clearly define vehicle/dynamometer noise character correlation and in-vehicle noise sensitivity. 830533. The effect of rotor metallurgy on brake perform- ance and wear resistance. J. P. Coyle and P. H. S. Tsang, Materials Technology Center, Bendix Automotive Group; and T. E. Johnson, Materials Technology Center, Bendix Automotive Group; Present Address: Diesel Engine Production Engi- neering, General Electric Co. Improvements in disc brake friction and wear characteris- tics are usually sought by alternating the disc pad composi- tion or processing conditions. This study investigated the effects of varying the cast iron rotor chemistry and mic- rostructure on the performance and wear resistance of a disc brake composed of such rotors and standard commer- cial semi-metallic disc pads. A statistical design of an engi- neering experiment was used to determine such effects of five chemical variables of the cast iron rotor - C, Si, Mn, P and Ti - and two processing variables - solidification and cooling rates. An increase in manganese or phosphorus content improved brake performance and decreased pad wear, compared to a standard chemistry cast iron. Cast irons with high titanium or carbon levels showed low fric- tion and high pad wear. Improved performance but high pad wear were found for cast irons with high silicon con- tents. A fast liquid solidification rate or a fast solid cooling ' rate significantly reduced pad wear without influencing per- formance. The changes in rotor chemistry in the present study did not seem to affect the rotor wear, however. 1983 SAE Transactions 830534. Microstructural changes of cast iron rotor sur- faces and their effects on brake performance and wear resistance. J. P. Coyle and P. H. S. Tsang, Materials Technology Center, Bendix Automo- tive Group. Rotor surface temperatures reaching above 700°C are not unusual for heavy-duty disc brakes in service, which are used in both heavy vehicles and high-performance passen- ger cars. Brake rotors are conventionally composed of pearlitic gray cast iron. The over 700°C temperatures experienced in heavy-duty service cause microstructural changes in which the surface rotor material is transformed from pearlitic to spheroidic cast iron. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of this transformation of rotor metal- lurgy on brake friction and wear. In this study, the normal and spheroidized rotors are coupled to a common semime- tallic friction material, and the respective brake pairs are then evaluated for possible difference in friction and wear properties. Tests of rotors so transformed, either by heat treatment or by temperature cycling on a brake dynamome- ter showed no significant change in braking performance, but an increase of 15% in pad wear and a doubling of rotor wear over the untransformed rotors. 830536. Serial bus structures for automotive applications. Anthony J. Bozzini and Alex Goldberger, MOS Microprocessor Division, Signetics Corp. The use of serial communications to route control informa- tion in an automobile can potentially provide many bene- fits. Serial data busses have been used in the data processing environment for many years but are unsuitable for use in real time control applications. Recently, Local Area Ne- tworks have been developed which provide the functional features required for control applications but are too expen- sive for use in the automobile. N. V. Philips and Signetics have applied these concepts to develop a Small Area Network capability which can be integrated onto micro- computers and other integrated circuit devices at low cost, providing the proper cost/performance tradeoff for their use in the automotive environment. 830537. An evaluation of serial protocols and media alter- natives for vehicle multiplex. William M. Floyd, United Technologies, Automotive Products Div.; and Ronald C. Nonnenmacher, United Technolo- gies, Automotive Products Div. The desire of automotive designers to provide increasing electronic feature content at a time when market pressures are dictating vehicle downsizing, has forced wire harness manufacturers to find ways of doing more, but in less space. Several methods of expanding the functional capability of the vehicle wire harness, while at the same time reducing its bulk, exist; however, Serial Multiplexing shows the most promise of meeting cost and reliability objectives. This pa- per describes recent evaluation of a serial multiplex system applied to "body electrical" vehicle functions. Data is ana- lyzed over a variety of media that are regarded as posses- sing the appropriate characteristics for volume production for automobiles. In addition, a variety of line discipline protocols are evaluated, and the rationale to be considered when selecting a protocol for a particular application is discussed. 96</page><page sequence="78">830539 - 830543 830539. Dual cylinder rolling piston rotary compressor for automotive air conditioner. Shuuji Fujisaki, Motomu Kawamura, Katsuyuki Kawasaki, and Susumu Kawaguchi, Mitsubishi Electric Corp., Shizuoka Works. Recently, conventional compressors for automotive air con- ditioner have been rapidly replaced with rotary type com- pressor, because rotary compressors satisfy the require- ments such as compact size, light weight, high compression efficiency, high durability and so on. Especially, rolling piston type rotary compressor have many excellent charac- teristics. (Its feature and performance were described at 1981 SAE International Congress.) We successfully developed dual cylinder rolling piston type rotary compressor for automotive air conditioner. This new product has special model which enables to control capacity range. This paper shows the configuration and experimental result of dual cylinder rolling piston type rotary compressor for automotive air conditioner. 830540. The spiral compressor - an innovative air condi- tioning compressor for the new generation auto- mobiles. Masaharu Hiraga, Sanden Corp. Sanden Corporation (named Sankyo Electric Co., Ltd. prior to September 1982) developed a new automobile air conditioning compressor, the "TR" type, based upon the spiral machine principle. Two spiral components have 2.8 turn involute spiral walls projected from discs. Both spiral components are housed in a cylindrical casing, with one in a fixed position and the other interleaved with the former at an angular relationship of 180°. The free moving component is driven by a crankshaft in an orbiting motion. The orbiting motion of the free moving component provides a continuous com- pression process in two pairs of compression pockets. The "TR" compressor has several unique features in its physical and mechanical design: (1) Specifically disposed and shaped spiral components to maximize the displace- ment within a small diameter casing, (2) A compliant crank mechanism utilizing the swing motion of an eccentric bush, (3) A perfect dynamic balancing mechanism with mini- mized radial forces, and (4) An anti-rotation coupling mechanism with a function of the orbiting thrust bearing. These basic features result in a number of advantages in application which are of interest to today's automotive design engineers: (a) High refrigeration capacity from a compact, lightweight package achieved by combining the super high speed capability (up to 13,000 rpm) and a high volumetric efficiency (75% to 85%). (b) Extremely smooth operation with low torque re- quirement and inherently low torque variation. (c) Weight reduction of the compressor and its mount- ing means. (d) High performance, comfortability and drivability combined with low N.V.H (Noise, Vibration, and Harsh- ness) characteristics. 830541. The characteristics of the spiral compressor for automotive air conditioning. Kiyoshi Terauchi, Yasuhiro Tsukagoshi, and Masaharu Hiraga, Sanden Corp. Sanden Corporation (named Sankyo Electric Co., Ltd. prior to September 1982) developed a new automotive air conditioning compressor, the "TR" type, based upon the spiral machine principle. The spiral principle, having been chosen after an elaborate comparative study of several new mechanisms including the vane rotary, the "TR" com- pressor, proved more than competitive with other types in every criterion. The design refinement program which followed re- peated prototype evaluations, included laboratory tests ranging from regular durability to extreme condition dura- bility, such as low speed-high pressure and low refriger- ant/oil charge tests, in addition to field tests in Okinawa Prefecture and other parts of Japan. 830542. The effect of the air flow nonuniformity on the thermal performance of automobile air condition- ing condenser. J. P. Chiou, Mechanical Engineer- ing Dept., University of Detroit, Detroit, MI. A mathematical method for determination of the heat transfer effectiveness of the air conditioning condenser ac- counting for the effect of the nonuniform cooling air flow distribution is presented. Using twelve typical two- dimensional air flow maldistribution models, the heat transfer effectiveness of the condenser is calculated. The deterioration of the thermal performance of the condenser due to the effect of the air flow nonuniformity is then deter- mined. The effect of the air flow nonuniformity on the sizing of the condenser is discussed. 1983 SAE Transactions 830543. An advanced car-air-conditioning system with mi- crocomputer. Yukio Yoshida and Shigetoshi Ta- naka, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. An advanced car air conditioner with microcomputer has been developed from the viewpoint of electromechanics. This system is completed on the basis of the advanced con- trol functions such as PID feedback temperature control, stepless coordinated air flow control, energy saving control, and self-diagnostic function, and new implementing tech- niques such as single chip microcomputer for controller, stepping motor for actuator, and hybrid IC for interface. These functions and techniques are also integrated and as- sembled as advanced control system for car air conditioner. The usefulness and effectiveness of these techniques has been confirmed by the results of tests on the simulated environment and actual car driving conditions. 97</page><page sequence="79">830544-830550 830544. Light duty automotive fuel economy. . . trends thru 1983. J. D. Murreil, S. Loos, R. Heavenrich, J. Cheng, and E. LeBaron, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This, the eleventh in a series of papers on EPA fuel econ- omy trends, emphasizes the current model Year (1983) as usual, but also gives increased emphasis to trends in vehicle technology, including catalyst and transmission subclasses. Final "CAFE" production volumes and MPG figures have been used to update the data bases through the 1980 Model Year, and an analytic method used in the past to allocate year-to-year fleet MPG changes to specific causes, such as weight mix shifts, has been reinstituted. Conclusions are presented on the relation between fuel economy and emission standards, catalyst types, and transmission types. 830545. Impact of consumer and manufacturer decisions on new car fuel economy. Philip D. Patterson, U.S. Department of Energy; and Fred W. West- brook, Camden Corp. The 90 percent improvement in new car fuel economy be- tween 1973 and 1982 has resulted from many types of new car purchase and new car manufacture decisions. Some of these decisions, such as purchasing a smaller car, buying a car with less performance, choosing a manual transmission, and selecting a diesel engine can be viewed as primarily new car consumer decisions. Over the decade where the price of gasoline tripled, consumer decisions accounted for about a third of the MPG increase. With the prospect of stable or declining gasoline prices for the near future, consumers may take back some of their past contributions to new car fuel economy. If new car buyers returned to their 1978 choices in auto characteristics the MPG would have been 9.3 percent lower than it actually was recorded in model year 1982. If consumers returned to the 1973 auto characteristics, a 17.4 percent reduction in MPG would have resulted in model year 1982. 1983 SAE Transactions 830546. Seasonal and regional MPG as influenced by en- vironmental conditions and travel patterns. Robert Crawford, Energy &amp; Environmental Analysis, Inc.; and Sol Kaufman, Falcon Re- search. In-use fuel economy shortfall varies regionally and season- ally in response to changing environmental conditions and travel patterns. Shortfall changes by 25 percent or more are associated with variations in miles travelled per day by in-use vehicles. Monthly variations in northern states are twice those in the south; air conditioning penalties also vary by region. Although regional differences in annual levels are relatively small, shortfall can increase by 16 percent in densely populated urban areas. These variations have been quantified in an analysis of time-series mpg data and related to variables commonly reported in fuel economy surveys. 830547. Recent trends in factors influencing automotive fuel demand. David H. Lax and K. G. Duleep, Energy and Environmental Analysis, Inc. This paper assesses three factors affecting projections of passenger car fuel consumption: 1) "fuel-switching" by con- sumers; 2) new car fuel economy trends through 1995; and 3) the on-road fuel economy characteristics of older cars. Surveys of monthly household motor fuel purchases in 1978-1981 are used to demonstrate a significant correlation between vehicle age and trends in "misfueling". Projections of new car fuel economy are derived using a technology- oriented model previously developed for the U.S. Depart- ment of Energy (DOE). The forecasts are sensitive to fuel prices, consumer discount rates, and technology payback periods. The paper discusses the effects of changes in vehi- cle use intensity and odometer on the in-use fuel economy of older cars. Information also is presented on the in-use fuel economy of pre-MY1975 vehicles. The paper concludes with an assessment of the effects of these fuel economy and fuel switching trends on future automobile fuel demand. 830548. Towards a world car. Ken B. Matthews and Mi- chael R. Appleby, Automobile Club of Southern California. Automobile sales figures, survey data, and the results of an automobile testing program entitled, "The Target Car Pro- gram", were used to evaluate the shift toward a universal or "World" car - a car that would fulfill the transportation needs of the average driver anywhere in the civilized world. The results of the evaluation indicate that a move towards the "World" car began in the United States in the early 1970's as the sales of full-size autos began to decline in favor of the smaller autos that are the standard in other areas of the world. 830549. Engineering for remanufacturing. Harry A. Holzwasser, Arrow Automotive Industries, Inc., Framingham, MA. Remanufacturing has come of age as an industry, stressing quality, production efficiency, and cost savings in response to growing consumer demand and the imperatives of wise energy and resource use. A threat to the remanufacturing alternative is engi- neering that seeks weight reduction and low cost in compo- nents rather than durability and hence remanufacturability. Such goals also endanger OEMs' reputation for quality. As American consumers become more pragmatic, the concept of totally remanufactured cars, as a dependable, low-cost alternative, generates greater public interest. 830550. Applications of Monte Carlo simulation to vehi- cle maintenance and component remanufacturing decisions. D. R. Bothe, Detroit Diesel Allison 98</page><page sequence="80">830550-830555 Div., GMC; R. L. Mitchell, General Motors Corp.; and R. R. Rutter, Automotive Rentals, Inc. As component and systems sophistication in both cars and trucks increase, improved diagnostic capabilities are re- quired to assure proper and expedient serviceability. Re- placement of electrical modules, starter motors, carburet- ors, fuel injectors and even whole engines or transmissions is encouraged by high labor costs and continued vehicle mobility mandates. The remanufacturing business has grown and components previously discarded now provide valuable core elements to feed the industry. To achieve efficient utilization of capital, equipment and labor, rema- nufacturers must estimate when this supply of core ele- ments will be available and plan their production schedules accordingly. In order to properly service private individuals and commercial fleets, minimize vehicle downtime and reduce life cycle costs, adaptation of available analytical tools must be made. This paper adopts the Monte Carlo simulation model as a predictive tool for OEM's, remanufacturers and large fleets to gauge the requirements for maintenance and facility requirements. 1983 SAE Transactions 830552. Investigations on a passenger car swirl-chamber diesel engine using different alcohol fuels. Franz F. Pischinger, Institute of Applied Thermody- namics, Technical University, Aachen, West Ger- many; Peter Burghardt and Cornelis Havenith, FEV-Research Institute, Aachen, West Ger- many; and Kurt Weidmann, Volks wagen werk AG, Wolfsburg, West Germany. Investigations on the suitability of various alcohol fuels as alternatives to conventional diesel fuel were carried out on a passenger car swirl-chamber diesel engine. The test results with a methanol and an ethanol diesel fuel blend show that without alteration of the engine adjustment a good perform- ance behaviour is obtained. In addition to a reduced soot emission and a considerably lower particulate emission the thermal efficiency mainly in the upper load range is higher than with pure diesel operation. The increased HC and CO emissions occurring at low loads can be avoided and a further improvement in energy consumption can be realized by adapting the injection timing for alcohol blend opera- tion. A complete substitution of the diesel fuel with a methanol-ignition improver mixture necessitates an adapted and alcohol-resistent fuel injection system. A soot free com- bustion and with the exception of the NOx emissions nearly the same low level of gaseous pollutants as with pure diesel operation are achieved. In the full load range the thermal efficiency of the alcohol engine is distinctly higher, whereas at part load the efficiency turns out to be lower. With re- gard to the engine efficiency and the HC and CO emissions at low loads a further optimization of the fuel injection system is necessary. 830553. Control of diesel exhaust emissions in under- ground coal mines - single-cylinder engine opti- mization for water-in-fuel microemulsions. T. J. Callahan, T. W. Ryan, III, and G. B. O'Neal, Southwest Research Institute; and R. W. Waytu- lonis, U.S. Bureau of Mines. The increased use of diesel-powered equipment in under- ground mines has prompted interest in reducing their ex- haust pollutants. Control of particulate emissions without substantial penalties in other emissions or fuel consumption is necessary. This paper describes test results on a precham- ber, naturally-aspirated, four-cycle diesel engine in which two different concentrations of water-in-fuel emulsions were run. The independent variables comprising the test matrix were fuel, speed, load, injection timing, injection rate, and compression ratio. The dependent variables of the experiment included particulate and gaseous emissions and engine thermal efficiency. Regression analysis was per- formed on the data to determine how particulate emissions were affected by fuel and engine parameters. Results of this analysis indicated that substantial reductions in particulate emissions could be obtained by utilizing water-in-fuel emul- sions. 830554. Performance of carbon/diesel fuel slurries in a medium-speed diesel engine. James F. Wakenell, Southwest Research Institute. The effects of carbon black/diesel fuel slurries on fuel injec- tion systems and performance of an EMD 567B two- cylinder locomotive research engine when operated on slurry fuel are presented in this paper. Without extensive modification to the diesel engine fuel transfer system, carbon black slurries cannot be run. Laboratory bench tests revealed clogged fuel filters, worn transfer pump components and frozen injector needle as- semblies. Engine performance while running slurries resulted in reduced thermal efficiency and increased BSFC at rated power output. Upon engine disassembly, inspection revealed severe ring and liner wear. Severe wear resulted during only 40 hours of engine operation. 830555.

This paper is the fourth in a series describing work spon- sored by the Bureau of Mines to reduce diesel particulate and gaseous emissions through fuel modification. A stabi- lized water microemulsion fuel developed in previous work was tested in a Caterpillar 3304 NA four-cylinder engine with compression ratio and injection timing and rate opti- 99</page><page sequence="81">830555 - 830560 mized for this fuel to demonstrate the emissions reductions achieved. It was tested in both standard and optimum con- figurations with both baseline DF-2 and optimized microe- mulsion fuels. Gaseous and particulate data are presented from steady-state tests using a computer-operated mini- dilution tunnel and from transient tests using a total exhaust dilution tunnel. The optimized engine-fuel combination was effective in reducing particulates and oxides of nitrogen in steady-state tests. However, the standard engine-fuel combination pro- vided the lowest particulate and NOx emissions in transient tests. 830556. Alternative fuels on a small high speed turbo- charged D.I. diesel engine. Ludwig Elsbett and Günter Elsbett, Elsbett-Konstruktion (Elko); and Klaus Elsbett and Michael Behrens, Elko Lizenz GmbH (Elko). The aim of this paper is to indicate what modifications are recommended in order to make a small light-duty d.i. diesel engine suitable for alternative fuels such as vegetable oil or gasoline diesel mixtures. The paper further gives performance charts and test results which indicate that good suitability can be obtained for alternative fuels. The authors believe that the light-duty d.i. diesel will rapidly become the most common car and tractor engine and that the multi-fuel suitability is an advantage in some markets as of today and will increasingly be so. The introduction of an inexpensive and reliable engine being able to run on a wide range of alternative fuels can be of major environmental, economical and political conse- quence. 830557. Performance of stabilized diesel fuels containing alcohols and water in single and multicylinder direct injection engines. R. T. Johnson and J. O. Stoffer, University of Missouri - Rolla, Rolla, MO. Single cylinder and multicylinder direct injection engines from the same engine family were used to evaluate the performance of stabilized diesel fuels containing methanol, ethanol, water, and chemical stabilizer. Engine speed and load conditions were selected to provide sufficient smoke and particulate emissions for accurate measurement. All fuels were operated at equal energy input rates for the en- gine being tested. The stabilized fuels containing alcohols had relatively minor effects on the HC, CO, and NOx emissions and en- gine brake efficiency for either the single or multicylinder engine. The water microemulsion fuel demonstrated a ten- dancy for increased HC and CO emissions, and minor changes in the NOx and brake efficiency for both engines. Both engines demonstrated reduced smoke and particulate emissions for the stabilized alcohol and water microemul- sion fuels. These reductions ranged from only a few percent to over 50% and were accompanied by significant increases in the Soluble Organic Fraction of the particulate. 830559. Single cylinder engine evaluations of stabilized diesel fuels containing alcohols. R. T. Johnson and J. O. Stoffer, University of Missouri - Rolla, Rolla, MO. Stabilized fuels containing methanol or ethanol, contamina- tion water, and chemical stabilizer were evaluated in an ASTM cetane rating engine and commercial Direct (DI) and Indirect (IDI) injection engines. Engine speed and load conditions were selected to provide adequate smoke and particulate emissions for accurate measurements. All fuels were tested at equal energy input rates for the given engine. The cetane engine results were quite variable compared to those from the other engines. For operation with the stabilized fuels: All three engines demonstrated only minor changes in HC, CO, and NOx emissions and engine effi- ciency. The cetane engine demonstrated very little change in the smoke and particulate emissions; the DI engine showed substantial reduction in smoke and particulates; and the IDI engine showed a consistent but smaller reduc- tion in smoke and particulates. The Soluble Organic Frac- tion of the particulate emissions increased significantly for the stabilized fuels operating in the DI engine. This increase was not as pronounced for the IDI engine. Fuel related operational problems are also described. 830560. Problems in crash avoidance and in crash avoid- ance research. A. C. Malliaris, Robert M. Nichol- son, James H. Hedlund, and Stanley R. Scheiner, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This paper presents the methodology and results of an anal- ysis of the available information on motor vehicle accident occurrence which could be used to provide a basis for estab- lishing priorities for future Government and private sector work directed at enhanced crash avoidance or mitigation. The work was stimulated by several factors: (1) the absence of a recent and updated framework for problem evaluation; (2) motor vehicles have changed substantially in the past several years; (3) the quantity and quality of accident data and vehicle accident avoidance performance information have increased very substantially over the past 5 years; and (4) Government policies and the amount of Government and private sector resources available for future work have changed. This study takes the Agency's automated files on accident experience as the baseline information on motor vehicle involvement in accidents of all types. This informa- tion, in conjunction with exposure data, yields relative rates of accident involvement as a function of vehicle type, vehi- cle size, and accident category. Primary parameters used in the analysis include the identity and frequency of precrash conditions and the incidence of driver, vehicle, and environ- ment related contributing factors. Two factors with major influences on the accident picture - car size and alcohol - are treated extensively. The paper concludes with an agenda 100</page><page sequence="82">830560 - 830564 for further attention which addresses the relative adequacy of data and methods available for sharper problem defini- tion and exploration of solutions.

This paper examines the influence of certain vehicle and tire characteristics on the open loop stability and control of automobiles. To facilitate the analysis three generic classes of vehicles have been defined, i.e., small, mid size, and large. In addition each class of vehicle is associated with two populations, referred to as past and present generation respectively. The steady-state stability, and controllability of these vehicles has been investigated using the Method of Moments. Stability and controllability metrics have been defined to quantify the maneuverability diagrams generated by this method and conclusions concerning vehicle design vintage based on these metrics have been drawn. In addi- tion the influence of certain tire in-use factors such as tire mix, inflation pressure, wear, etc., have been investigated. Discussion: W. F.

An analysis of straight line vehicle braking performance as it relates to basic vehicle, braking system and tire character- istics has been conducted with information drawn from a review of vehicle precrash accident experience focusing on the "no control" condition. Pertinent motor vehicle attrib- utes were reviewed as a function of vehicle size and vintage. The influence of these attributes on vehicle performance in hard braking was analyzed. Stability and control perform- ance was characterized in terms of axle lockup and axle lockup sequence as a function of vehicle attributes and per- turbing torques and forces. Both analytical techniques and test results were used in the evaluation. All motor vehicles of early 1970's vintage appear to be underbraked at the front with the concomitant tendency to lock up the rear axle first, a situation that may compromise stability under hard braking. The extent of front underbraking for these earlier vintage cars appears not to be very sensitive to car size for larger cars, but it increases sharply for smaller cars. Based on measurements of a limited but diverse sample, post 1980 vintage cars during hard braking offer actual front brake proportioning of 75 to 85 percent, which repre- sents a level 20 to 40 percent higher than that of early 1970's vintage cars. Because of these differences in front brake proportioning, post 1980 model year cars have a much lower propensity to rear axle lockup under hard brak- ing than cars of 1970 vintage. This is particularly true of a comparison of small cars of these vintages. Based on an examination of a sample of post 1980 production cars, there is considerable variability in brake proportioning by com- parison with models of the early 1970's. As regards trucks, light duty trucks of recent vintage appear also to be moving toward higher levels of front brake proportioning, whereas the heavier medium and heavy duty trucks remain much underbraked at the front. The paper concludes with an agenda for further attention. Discussion: W. F. Milliken, Jr., Milliken Research Associates, Inc. David H. Weir, Dynamic Research, Inc. Robert D.

Driver factors, simulators and other instru- mented measurement approaches. Herbert R. Miller, R. Wade Allen, and Anthony CO. Stein, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Several studies have shown that driver errors predominate as contributing factors in highway accidents, with environ- mental and vehicular factors trailing a distant second and third, respectively. Yet no one would deny that highway crashes typically involve combinations of these factors in- teracting in frequently unknown ways. This review is fo- cused on driver factors and the use of observational studies involving simulators and other instrumented measurement approaches to develop a better understanding of the events which lead to crashes and the contributions of each type of factor. A review is performed of key studies from the high- way, driver safety and human factors research literature to identify the driver factors that are major contributors to highway accidents, and whose influence should be consid- ered in the performance of future observational research studies. Past use of simulators and instrumented vehicles is discussed and the potential for applying this technology in the crash avoidance area is assessed. 830564. Visibility from motor vehicles. Robert L.

Highly extended life of transmission bearings of "Sealed-Clean" concept. A. Tanaka, K. Furu- mura, and T. Ohkuma, Automotive Engrg. R&amp;D Center, Nippon Seiko K.K. (NSK). A unique stress analysis method was applied to the study of premature flaking failures of ball bearings used in manual transmissions for passenger cars. The study determined that premature flakings were due to the abnormal surface- originating fatigue rather than the normal subsurface- originating type fatigue. Existence of fine ferrous particles of high hardness in transmission oil was the cause. Based on these findings, "Sealed-Clean" bearings have been devel- oped which have special rubber seals on both sides of bear- ings. Tests proved that "Sealed-Clean" bearings last several times longer than open-type standard bearings or special bearings having steel balls of extra-large size. Already 4.4 million pieces of "Sealed-Clean" bearings have been in- stalled in 16 models of transmissions during the last six years. This stress analysis method has opened a new possi- bility of remaining-life prediction on ball and roller bear- ings. The "Sealed-Clean" concept is being applied to other usages including bearings for steel rolling mills with re- markable success. 1983 SAE Transactions 830571. An experimental analysis of fluid flow in a torque converter. Akio Numazawa, Fumihiro Ushijima, and Kagenori Fukumura, Toyota Motor Corp. (Japan); and Tomo-o Ishihara, Univ. of Tokyo (Japan). Theoretical analysis of the fluid flow in a torque converter is not easy because it is a three-dimensional and very com- plicated problem. A new flow visualization method applicable to oil flow, namely a liquid-resin film method, was developed to ob- serve the fluid flow in a torque converter. The existence of cross, swirl, reverse and separated flow in torque converters was made clear by this method, and it was clarified that the existence of these kinds of flow resulted in depressing torque converter efficiency. Additionally, the flow pattern in a torque converter was predicted theoretically by estimating the pressure dis- tribution in it. An elliptical torque converter with high efficiency was developed by flow visualization and theoretical considera- tion. 830573. Exact measurement of power loss in automotive transmission and axle for fuel economy. Haru- hiro Katoh and Takeshi Inoh, Heavy-Duty Truck &amp; Bus, Research &amp; Experiment, R&amp;E, Isuzu Mo- tors Ltd.; and Kiyohiko Umezawa, Tokyo Insti- tute of Technology, Research Laboratory of Precision Machinery &amp; Electronics. Many problems have been encountered in attempting to clarify the behaviors of drivetrain components from the standpoint of the power loss. This paper describes the ana- lytical and experimental research to develop a method of measuring the total power losses of transmission and axle whereby far more accurate test results can be obtained than by the conventional means with good repeatability. In this pursuit, the power loss of the drivetrain is divided into two groups, i.e. gear tooth friction loss and lubricant churning loss, with the resulting practical formulation which permits calculation of these two losses on a separate basis. Also covered are the results so far achieved by means of practical application of the above approach and concept in both bench and field testings aiming at improvement of fuel economy and prediction of the drivetrain lubricant temper- atures in the field operation. 1983 SAE Transactions 830574. Comparison of CVT engine operating schedules. David Ganoung, Consultant. Maximum fuel economy and low exhaust emissions can exist together if a predominantly wide-open-throttle engine operating schedule is used to complement a continuously variable transmission. Moreover, the concurrently required engine recalibration often entails less effort than the more usual fuel consumption and emission mapping procedure. 830575. A reexamination of the gas turbine - torque con- verter power transmission unit. R. R. Ossi, A VCO Lycoming. The combination of the free turbine gas turbine engine and the hydraulic torque converter was reexamined. A non- dimensional matching procedure is proposed and non- dimensional results are presented; both of which facilitate comparative analyses. The effects on system specific fuel consumption and heat rejection are discussed. An optimum power unit combination is suggested. The Appendix illustrates how non-dimensional match- ing may be performed. 830576. Microprocessor controlled fuel injection for automotive diesel engines. G. G. Lucas, D. McLean, and P. Adcock, Loughborough Univer- sity. An electronically controlled fuel system has been developed which enables the injection timing and fuel delivery to be adjusted from engine cycle to cycle using a small micro- computer and a solenoid operated injector. 103</page><page sequence="85">830576-830583 The injector uses a powerful solenoid to control the needle lift of a standard injector and employs pressure time metering to regulate the fuel delivery. The microcomputer is used to determine the required timing pulses which are used to control the current in the solenoid. The maximum delivery of the injector is 60mm3/injection and the system has been successfully tested on an 1800 cc IDI four cylinder engine fitted with Pintaux fuel injectors. 830578. Steady state and transient control through a microprocessor-electrohydraulic system of an in- tegrated engine-transmission unit. F. J. Wallace, D. Howard, and M. Tarabad, School of Engineer- ing, University of Bath. The paper describes the steps in the implementation of a self-optimising steady state micro-processor control system for the integrated truck engine transmission system known as the differential compound engine (DCE). Although the system in its present form is based on a small and slow microprocessor, the control strategy evolved is directly ap- plicable to the faster system ultimately envisaged. The sec- ond part of the paper deals with the requirements for faster control of transients, with particular reference to opera- tional safety requirements, such as limiting compressor speed and maximum cylinder pressure. It is considered that the unit forms the basis for ad- vanced on- and off-highway vehicle power plant with uniquely attractive operating characteristics. 830579. Closed loop digital electronic control of diesel engine timing. Michael J. Pipho and David B. Kittelson, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Uni- versity of Minnesota. The performance of a closed-loop electronic fuel injection timing control system for diesel engines has been investi- gated, both experimentally and analytically. The Electronic Control System (ECS) studied is a version of the "Opti- mizer," a peak seeking control which can find the maxi- mum of one variable with respect to another. In this case, it was used to find the timing for maximum brake torque (MBT). The ECS can also be operated in a "biased" mode in which it will hold the timing either advanced or retarded of MBT, but in a fixed relationship to it. Performance and emissions of a medium duty engine equipped with the ECS were measured on an engine dyna- mometer. The results clearly demonstrate that, for a variety of operating conditions and for two fuels, the ECS can find and hold the timing at MBT or in fixed relationship to it. BSFC, smoke, and NOx values obtained under ECS control were, in most cases, the same as those obtained with the timing set manually to the same mean value as that selected by the ECS. A computer model of the engine/ECS combination which successfully simulates the system under the condi- tions of the experimental tests is described. This model has been used to predict the influence of several ECS modifica- tions on its performance. 830580. Improvement of diesel engine startability by ce- ramic glow plug start system. Hideo Kawamura, Isuzu Motors Ltd., Japan; and Shigeyoshi Yama- moto, Kycera Ltd., Japan. This paper describes the startability of small swirl chamber diesel engines which is inherently inferior to gasoline en- gines, particularly in the cold climate operation, and a new start assisting system using silicon nitride ceramic glow plugs which offers the same level of convenience in engine starting as in gasoline fueled vehicles, i.e. elimination of waiting time before engine start, through a remarkable re- duction in the plug preheat period. The paper also details the new features of the ceramic glow plug capable of withstanding high engine tempera- tures and the abrupt temperature changes overcoming brittleness, a major developmental stumbling block, in com- parison with the conventional metal glow plug. 1983 SAE Transactions 830582. Diesel engine load control with a hydrostatic transmission. Daniel C. Garvey, Woodward Governor Co. The performance of an engine load control system which seeks to maintain a constant material feedrate to a self- propelled harvest machine was investigated. An adjustable load level was maintained on the engine by controlling the displacement of a pump in the hydrostatic transmission drive. Theoretical results descriptive of performance ob- tained with three different control algorithms are presented. A load control system with an adjustable grade compensa- tion algorithm has been developed and applied to a large number of different harvest machines. 1983 SAE Transactions 830583. (SP-538) Multilayer ElectroGalvanized (Zn-Cr-CrOx) steel sheet for optimum corrosion protection of car bodies. A. Catanzano, Ferrari Automobili S.p.A.; and G. Arrigoni, M. Palladi- no, and M. Sarracino, Teksid Acciai S.p.A. Complex requirements a precoated steel must satisfy during pressing, welding, painting and providing optimum corro- sion resistance in use, are reviewed. A monofunctional coating (zinc or zinc alloy) cannot satisfy all these parame- ters. A Multilayer ElectroGalvanized (MEG) product, Zin- crox, was found to be the most suitable to car body applica- tions; the continuously superimposed electrolytic layers are: Zn-Cr-CrOx. The coating is still 99% Zn, but the thin layers of Cr-CrOx have solved critical problems: formabil- ity, weldability, welding fumes, electrode wear, paint adhe- sion, hydrogen cratering, galvanic contacts and resistance to the most severe corrosion tests with a reduced zinc thick- ness. Advantages in costs, scrap downpricing, main applica- tions and developments are reported too. 104</page><page sequence="86">830584-830589 830584. (SP-538) The effect of emission control systems and fuel composition on the composition of ex- haust gas condensate. Joseph E. Hunter, Jr., Gen- eral Motors Research Laboratories. Condensate composition was determined for 1981-82 Gen- eral Motors vehicles with a) diesel engines and no conver- ters, b) gasoline engines with oxidizing converters, c) gaso- line engines with computer command control and dual bed bead or dual bed monolith converters, and d) gasoline engines with computer command control and single bed bead converters having three-way catalysts. The pH was found to range between 2.3 and 9.2 for the systems studied. Anions present in low pH condensates were sulfate, nitrate and chloride. Near neutral condensates and basic condensates also contained ammonia plus bicar- bonate and carbonate anion, and had generally higher sul- fate content than the acid condensates. Results are shown to be related primarily to differences resulting from the catalytic reduction of NOx and fuel sulfur content. 830585. (SP-538) Corrosiveness of exhaust gas conden- sates. Robert L. Chance, General Motors Re- search Laboratories, Warren, MI; and Ronald G. Ceselli, VW of America, Warren, MI. Eight exhaust gas condensates were evaluated for their cor- rosiveness towards plain carbon steel, Type 1 aluminized steel, Galvalume, and Type 409 stainless steel. Test meth- ods included the use of anodic polarization measurements and a cyclic immersion procedure. The corrosivity of an exhaust condensate is affected by its chemistry, which in turn may be affected by variations in fuel, engine operating conditions, type of engine, and the emission control system. Condensate pH of those tested ranged from 2.3 to 9.0. Results of the corrosion tests showed that acidic conden- sates were generally the most corrosive, but that substantial pitting corrosion could occur with alkaline condensates. 830586. (SP-538) New ferritic stainless steels for automo- tive trim application. Toshiro Adachi and Ta- kayoshi Kanamaru, Nisshin Steel Co., Ltd., Shunan Research &amp; Development Laboratory (Japan). New ferritic stainless steels have been developed for use by the automobile industry. These steels demonstrate high re- sistance to pitting and a longer product lifetime can be expected, especially in "chloride type" environments. This report deals with the effects of alloying elements on steels containing 16-19% Cr, with special attention devoted to pitting resistance. It was observed that a small amount of Cu and Ni increased pitting resistance. A decrease in the S content of the steel led to an increase in the pitting resistance. The remarkable improvement in the rust staining resistance for this low S steel was confirmed by the CASS test. Based on results, 19%Cr-0.5%Cu-Ni-(Nb)-low S ferritic stainless steels were selected. These steels "NSS442M2" and "NSS442M3" have excellent rust staining resistance in the accelerated tests. The atmospheric exposure test proved that the rust staining resistance of NSS442M2 and NSS442M3 was comparable to or greater than that of Type 304. 830587. Analysis of hydrocarbon emissions mechanisms in a direct injection spark-ignition engine. An- thony J. Giovanetti, Jack A. Ekchian, and John B. Heywood, Massachusetts Institute of Technol- ogy; and Edward F. Fort, International Harvester Co. The direct injection spark-ignition engine is the only inter- nal combustion engine with the potential to equal the effi- ciency of the diesel and to tolerate a wide range of fuel types and fuel qualities without deterioration of performance. However, this engine has low combustion efficiency and excessive hydrocarbon emissions when operating at light load. In this paper, potential sources of hydrocarbon emis- sions during light load operation are postulated and ana- lyzed. The placement of fuel away from the primary com- bustion process in conjunction with a lack of secondary burnup are isolated as important hydrocarbon emissions mechanisms. Analyses show that increasing cylinder gas temperatures can improve secondary burnup of fuel which would reduce hydrocarbon emissions. Practical means to achieve this include higher compression ratio and use of ceramic parts in the combustion chamber. 1983 SAE Transactions 830588. Investigation of a spark-assisted diesel engine. R. G. Phatak, Southwest Research Institute; and K. Komiyama, Komatsu, Ltd., Japan. A single-cylinder, open-chamber direct-injection (OCDI) diesel engine was converted to low compression ratio, spark-assisted operation. A modular construction cylinder head was built for the test work. The research work indi- cated that on a typical OCDI diesel engine, several spark plug locations are possible to produce successful ignition of a wide range of fuels. Performance tests were run with different compression and swirl ratio combinations. The best combination was found to be 12.2 compression ratio and 10 swirl ratio. The spark-assisted engine was perform- ance tested with methanol and DF-2 plus 20% methanol emulsified fuel. The spark was always required with metha- nol, however, with emulsified fuel spark was desirable for starting and warming up periods. The investigation suggested the feasibility of economi- cally developing multi-fuel spark-assisted diesel engines. 830589. Some characteristics of spark assisted direct in- jection engine. George S. Baranescu, ATR Corp. The paper analyses the basic aspects of spark assisted direct injection (SADI) engines of the type with the start of com- bustion close to the beginning of fuel injection, and with no 105</page><page sequence="87">830589 - 830594 special arrangements for fuel vaporization on the combus- tion chamber walls. The analysis refers to the fuel sensitivity of the engine, the correlation between air motion and fuel injection, and the combustion development in this engine. The analysis evidentiates the high sensitivity of this en- gine to certain characteristics of the fuel, and explains some particularities of the engine operation like the stabilized flame front, the necessity of spark assistance during the en- tire fuel injection, and the unstable operation in certain con- ditions. Also the influence of SADI engine characteristics on its performance is investigated. Solutions for improving the operation of this engine, as well as the engine perspectives are discussed. 830590. An experimental and analytical study of flash- boiling fuel injection. Rajshekhar D. Oza and James F. Sinnamon, Engine Research Depart- ment, General Motors Research Laboratories. Flash-boiling fuel injection is obtained by preheating liquid fuel within the injector so that the sudden decrease of pressure during injection causes rapid boiling of the fuel. Rapid expansion of the vapor phase may then atomize the liquid jet. Two distinct types of flash atomization were observed experimentally. First, at relatively low fuel temperatures the liquid jet remains intact for a short period after leaving the nozzle, then suddenly breaks up when rapid bubble growth begins. Second, at higher fuel temperatures, flash boiling within the injector orifice produces an underexpanded, compressible, two-phase flow. Sudden expansion immedi- ately upon leaving the orifice yields large spray cone angles. An analytical model of vapor-bubble growth was ap- plied to enhance understanding of the flash-injection proc- ess. Calculated time scales for bubble growth and delay times were found to be consistent with the above two flash- ing regimes at both low and high fuel preheat temperatures. Also an unfavorable trend toward suppressed bubble growth with increasing injection pressure was calculated. 1983 SAE Transactions 830592. The role of chemical activity and turbulence in- tensity in prechamber-torch organization of com- bustion of a stationary flow of a fuel-air mixture. L. A. Gussak, The Institute of Chemical Physics of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. The present paper is concerned with the main experimental facts and generalized results of an investigation into an interaction of the chemico-kinetic and gas-hydrodynamic factors of initiation and promotion of inflammation and turbulent combustion of a stationary flow of the working mixture by a prechamber-torch of a stationary flow of the combustion products of an auxiliary mixture. This interac- tion is shown to be most favorable, with the lowest tempera- tures and shortest delays giving the most reliable inflamma- tion, with the fastest and most complete turbulent combustion stabilized over the widest range. This occurs only in the case of independent formation of high thermo- dynamically super equilibrium concentrations of chemically active hydrogen atoms, hydrogen-containing radicals, and other chemically active particles in the products of incom- plete combustion of the rich auxiliary mixture in the pre- chamber. They are discharged therefrom, after a short resi- dence time in the prechamber, into the working mixture of the combustion chamber in a small amount (about 2-3%) and at a small (about half the critical value) subcriticai pressure difference between the prechamber and the com- bustion chamber via short outlet, sharp-edged channels of a small cross-section and forming multiple-small-kernel of discrete turbulent structure of the main mixture in the com- bustion zone. This principal and technology underlies the forced controlled organization of an avalanche activation of the combustion process (the LAG-Process). 830593. Effect of fuel volatility on driveability at low and intermediate ambient temperatures. N. D. Brink- man, General Motors Research Laboratories; E. D. Steinke, Šuntech, Inc.; F. J. Villforth, Texaco Inc.; and W. C. Williams, Amoco Oil Co. The Coordinating Research Council (CRC) measured cold- start and warmup driveability at low (-20 to 28°F) and intermediate (40 to 69°F) ambient temperatures using six- teen 1980 model cars and nine fuels. This was the first CRC study at low temperature. Average driveability was worse at low than at intermediate temperature for some cars, but for others the reverse was true. As found previously, decreasing fuel volatility deteriorated driveability. A regression model was developed to relate cold start and warmup driveability to fuel volatility as measured by 10, 50, and 90% distilla- tion temperatures. Overall, as ambient temperature de- creased, the importance of the 10% distillation temperature increased. 830594. Fuel and vehicle effects on low-temperature oper- ation of diesel vehicles - the 1981 CRC field test. M. L. McMillan, General Motors Research Lab- oratories; and E. G. Barry, Mobil Research and Development Corporation. A Coordinating Research Council (CRC) cooperative pro- gram utilizing seven North American diesel-powered ve- hicles (four passenger cars and three heavy-duty trucks) and eight fuels (three base fuels and Ave flow improver additive-treated versions of the base fuels) was run in Ka- puskasing, Ontario, Canada, between January and April 1981. Minimum operating temperatures for each vehicle- fuel combination were determined and compared with pre- dictions from laboratory tests. Significant differences among vehicles were found and related to fuel system de- sign. The use of flow improvers permitted some vehicles with some fuels to operate substantially below the fuel cloud point. None of the laboratory tests predicted the per- formance of all fuels in all vehicles, but the LTFT (Low- Temperature Flow Test) and the WPI (Wax Precipitation 106</page><page sequence="88">830594-830607 Index), an empirical relationship combining cloud point and pour point, offered promise. 830595. Front-end volatility requirements of late model cars at intermediate ambient temperatures. P. J. Clarke, Exxon Research &amp; Engineering Com- pany, Linden, N.J. The response of 1975-1981 model year vehicles to front-end fuel volatility was measured in a consumer survey carried out in Houston in the winter of 1981-82. Two hundred ten customers, approximating the car population for these years, were given gasolines varying in front-end volatility. Responses to these changes in volatility were measured by weekly telephone interviews with each customer. Results show that existing ASTM volatility specifications (Volatil- ity Class E ASTM D 439) provides hot engine driveability protection at 68°F (20.0°C) and even greater protection below 68°F. Sluggish performance (smooth acceleration but at a reduced rate) was the major hot driveability problem observed with fuels of high volatility, with occasional stall- ing, rough idle and poor hot start being significant but lesser problems. No vehicles suffered disabling vapor lock even on the most volatile fuel tested. Thus, the ASTM volatility specifications provide a significant measure of overprotection against the serious customer inconvenience and safety concerns associated with road stoppage. Incorpo- ration of narrower temperature ranges and more volatility classes in the specifications would maintain the demon- strated high level of protection with no loss in performance and would allow gasoline refiners greater flexibility in uti- lizing high octane light ends. 830596. Low temperature operability of diesels. T. R. Coley, PARAMINS Technology Division, Esso Chemical Limited, Abingdon, England. Operating difficulties with diesel powered equipment dur- ing recent cold winter periods lead to the formation by the European Co-ordinating Council of an Investigation Group to examine the relevance of the Cold Filter Plugging Point test to specify the low temperature quality of diesel fuel. Experience on low temperature operability of diesel vehicles was obtained from many sources within the Motor, Petroleum and Additive industries. Examination of all the data confirmed that the CFPP test is still providing a realistic indication of the lowest temperature at which a diesel fuel will operate satisfactorily in typical European diesel equipment. 830598.

Joining aluminium for mass production indus- tries. R. M. Rivett and W. Lucas, The Welding Institute. Resistance welding is the major process used for the mass production of sheet metal components but, when used on aluminium, problems arise because of the conductivity of the sheet, the rapid degradation of the copper electrodes and the tendency to solidification cracking of some alloys. It would therefore be advantageous if MIG spot welding could be applied under mass production operating condi- tions. This paper describes work conducted to try and under- stand some of the factors influencing the resistance and MIG spot welding of aluminium alloys and thereby develop simple operating procedures and equipment to permit their implementation in areas such as the vehicle fabrication. 1983 SAE Transactions 830600. Punch riveting: a new concept in joining alumi- num using continuous wire feed. T. J. Housden, Alean International Ltd., Banbury Laboratories, Banbury, England; and D. G. W. Claydon, Alean International Ltd., Kingston Laboratories, Kingston, Canada. Punch riveting uses a tool which is fed continuously with wire and makes a joint by cutting this wire to the required length and punching it through the components to be joined. This eliminates the need for drilling holes and using pre-formed rivets. The rivet is subsequently 'headed' and 'tailed' by applying pressure to it, and this can be done either in the same combination tool or separately. Rivet heads can be in a variety of shapes or flush. The entire operation takes about 5 seconds and joint strengths are comparable with those of conventionally riveted joints. 830606.

This paper outlines a systematic approach, using a TEM cell, for evaluating the electromagnetic (EM) radiated sus- ceptibility of electronic equipment. The purpose of the pa- per is to provide guidelines, for those using TEM cells for 107</page><page sequence="89">830607-830612 performing EM susceptibility measurements, to improve the repeatability and, hence, the value of their test results. The paper describes the test setup, details the step-by-step proce- dures to use in performing susceptibility measurements, and discusses pertinent information related to the range of appli- cation and limitations associated with the use of TEM cells. 1 983 SAE Transactions 830608. A study of electromagnetic fields in and around a farm tractor beneath 345 kV transmission lines. A. A. Mahmoud, Electrical Engineering De- partment, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa; M. Howard, John Deere Product Engineering Cen- ter, Waterloo, Iowa; and R. E. Post, Electrical Engineering Department, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa. A study to characterize the electromagnetic field distribu- tion in and around a John Deere 4440 tractor beneath a 345 kV transmission line was jointly performed by Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa and John Deere Product Engineer- ing Center, Waterloo, Iowa. This characterization includes electric field intensity measurement at 60 Hz and RF spec- trum measurements up to 1 GHz. Vehicle dashboard in- strumentation utilizing micro-processor technology was also evaluated for their functionality beneath this same 345 kV line. Methods and techniques used for evaluating elec- tronic systems at the component level were also evaluated. 1983 SAE Transactions 830609. System electromagnetic compatibility through component testing - an overview. David D. Bai- ley, Fred D. Esenwein, and James G. Harvey, Packard Electric Div., General Motors Corp., Warren, OH. By nature, automotive electronic systems are susceptible to Electromagnetic Interference (EMI). Devices capable of suppressing EMI have become an integral part of the auto- motive electronic system design. Methods of testing these devices individually and as part of the total electronic sys- tem have been developed and used as a design tool by the engineer. These methods range from individual component tests to total electronic system analysis and cover such areas as radiated noise susceptibility and the effects of electrical transients on the electronic system. The ability to test components in the laboratory allows the engineer to assemble reliable subsystems from which a total electronic system may be designed. Components and subsystems may be tested using a TEM cell, anechoic chamber and/or direct injection of noise signals. Computer control of the test provides repeatable results and better turn-around time than can be obtained by manual testing. This paper will present different methods of perform- ing Electromagnetic Compatibility testing on components and electrical subsystems. Procedures for characterizing susceptibility to EMI will be reviewed and its applicability to the design process will be discussed. Case histories will be included to illustrate the advantages of component and subsystem testing to total vehicle analysis. 830610. Improvements to the SMAC program. Thomas R. Perl, Dale O. Anderson, and Charles Y. Warner, Collision Safety Engineering, Inc. The Simulation Model of Automobile Collisions (SMAC) computer program has seen more than a decade of use under NHTSA auspices. Although SMAC has proven itself to be a useful investigative tool, the program has several shortcomings which either have been addressed by the authors or need to be addressed by further work. This paper presents the results of our ongoing work to improve SMAC and our recommendations for further work. Those model features discussed herein which either have been or need to be revised consist of (1) the calculation of crush forces when penetration is deep (2) the representation of the vehicles' crush pressure vs deflection relationship and (3) the distri- bution of tire normal forces in reaction to pitch and roll. An input interfacing program called SMACED has been written and is described. This editing program greatly sim- plifies the use of SMAC and will be found particularly useful for the inexperienced or infrequent SMAC user. Fi- nally, the authors make recommendations for the further validation of SMAC once the discussed improvements in model features have been incorporated. 830611. Determination of crashworthiness in full frontal car/car collisions by fixed rigid barrier testing. Thomas F. MacLaughlin and Roger A. Saul, Na- tional Highway Traffic Safety Administration, East Liberty, OH; and Pong Chou and Dennis A. Guenther, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH. Three groups of crash tests were analyzed to determine how well the standard fixed rigid barrier measures potential crash survivability in small cars when impacted full fron- tally by larger cars. In addition to experimental results, simple analytical methods were used to determine and com- pare the level of occupant protection in the small cars. The fixed rigid barrier appears to be an accurate crashworthiness-measuring device for small cars in high speed full frontal car/car collisions, if test velocities are selected on the basis of equivalent energy between car/bar- rier and car/car collisions as opposed to equivalent momen- tum. 830612. Friction applications in accident reconstruction. Charles Y. Warner, Gregory C. Smith, Michael B. James, and Geoff J. Germane, Collision Safety Engineering, Inc., Orem, UT. The determination of appropriate friction coefficient values is an important aspect of accident reconstruction. Tire- roadway friction values are highly dependent on a variety of physical factors. Factors such as tire design, side force limi- tations, road surface wetness, vehicle speed, and load shift- 108</page><page sequence="90">830612-830617 ing require understanding if useful reconstruction calcula- tions are to be made. Tabulated experimental friction coeffi- cient data are available, and may be improved upon in many situations by simple testing procedures. This paper presents a technical review of basic concepts and principles of fric- tion as they apply to accident reconstruction and automobile safety. A brief review of test measurement meth- ods is also presented, together with simple methods of fric- tion measurement to obtain more precise values in many situations. This paper also recommends coefficient values for reconstruction applications other than tire-roadway forces. 830613. Computer modeling of intrusion effects on occu- pant dynamics in very severe frontal crashes. Sherman E. Henson, John J. Dueweke, and Matthew Huang, Automotive Safety Office, Ford Motor Co. Computer simulations of occupant dynamics in frontal crashes have pretty much been done like sled tests, in that crash-induced deformation of the interior - which may be significant for the occupant - has usually not been ac- counted for. The object of occupant dynamics simulation studies is often to assess the effect of changes in vehicle front-end parameters on occupant response. But these pa- rameter variations may influence the amount of interior deformation. In order to simulate more accurately occupant dynamics in very severe crashes, the interior deformation caused by engine intrusion should concurrently be simu- lated. Crash test results over a range of speeds were used in a computer simulation study of occupant compartment in- trusion in high speed barrier crash tests. It was found that intrusion has a significant effect on occupant response and where appropriate should be included in crash simulations. For the crash conditions simulated, intrusion increases the restrained occupant's head and chest accelerations while no clear trend emerged for the unrestrained occupant. 830614. The economic costs to society of motor vehicle accidents. Lawrence J. Blincoe and Stephen Luchter, National Highway Traffic Safety Ad- ministration. An estimate was made of the economic cost to society of motor vehicle accidents in 1980, including medical costs, productivity losses, property damage, legal actions, coroner expenses, emergency services, and insurance and public ad- ministration. Both total and unit costs were estimated for each of these categories. The sensitivity of the total was estimated for changes in the incidence of serious injury and for different discount rates. 1983 SAE Transactions 830615. Hot wire air flow meter for engine control sys- tem. Yutaka Nishimura, Yoshishige Ohyama, and Takao Sasayama, Hitachi Research Labora- tory, Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan; and Sadayasu Ueno, and Tadahiko Ohtani, Sawa Works, Hita- chi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. A new robust hot wire air flow meter with wire winding probe, to be located in the bypass air passage of the intake air passage, was developed for an elctronic engine control system. This bypass type hot wire air flow meter can measure mean air velocity precisely in pulsating flow when the length of the bypass passage and the pressure loss in the bypass are selected appropriately. 830616. Backpressure variable transducer two stage EGR control system. Daniel C. Ahrns and Shane H. Rachedi, Emission Components Dept., Powert- rain &amp; Chassis Product Engrg. Office, Ford Mo- tor Co. To meet the challenging task of good vehicle driveability and fuel economy at the more stringent 1983 exhaust emission standards, the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) must be controlled accurately at variable rates as a function of engine mass air flow under all vehicle operating condi- tions. To achieve this objective, Ford Motor Company devel- oped a new EGR control system referred to as Backpres- sure Variable Transducer (BVT) with two stages of opera- tions. The first stage regulates EGR at a low and constant flow rate for light load and low speed operating conditions. The second stage provides high and variable rates of EGR for moderate to heavy load and high speed conditions. An exhaust gas backpressure input to BVT provides a signal proportional to engine mass air flow and the transducer calibration determines the operating stage. A closed loop feedback feature of the transducer maintains the required flow accuracy and compensates for any EGR valve func- tional deterioration. Description, theory of operation and test results are discussed on this paper. The initial application of the BVT EGR control system is the 1983 1.6L CVH engines built to California and Fed- eral Emission Standards. 1983 SAE Transactions 830617. Development of a new variable venturi carbure- tor. Norihiko Nakamura and Takaaki Itoh, Toyota Motor Corp.; and Toshiharu Morino, Ai- san Kogyo Co., Ltd. A new variable venturi carburetor has been developed, in order to achieve high metering accuracy, fuel economy, higher power and good driveability of the vehicle. This carburetor is a down-draft-type, and has better character- istics compared with the fixed venturi carburetor, such as better fuel atomization, lower cycle-to-cycle variation of combustion in lean mixture, faster response, and higher power. For this carburetor, a new type venturi and a new cold enrichment system has been developed. This venturi type has an exponential-profile with a nearly constant in- creasing rate of venturi opening area to the suction piston stroke. The new cold enrichment system controls the air- 109</page><page sequence="91">830617 - 830624 fuel ratio in all conditions by changing air bleed quantities using the thermowax. With this system, cold driveability is improved greatly. 830618. Volkswagen's development of the new carbureted exhaust emission concept for model year 1982. Harald Koch and Dietrich Meyerdierks, Volk- swagenwerk AG; and John Golden, Volkswagen of America. A complete new emission control system has been designed for Volkswagen four cylinder in-line carburetor power plant in model year 1982. This paper will describe the main com- ponents of the mixture formation and emission control system consisting basicly of a new carburetor and dual bed catalytic converter. The paper also shows the development results in the area of emission and fuel consumption. 830619. Requirements for overnight recharge of personal electric vehicles. W. F. Hamilton and S. J. Kiselewich, General Research Corp., Santa Bar- bara, CA; and G. H. Mader, Electric Power Re- search Institute, Palo Alto, CA. EV driving and recharging were simulated with travel data from the 1977 NPTS. Full recharge times of four to sixteen hours were considered for EVs with ranges from 40 to 100 miles. Recharges in less than 16 hours were seldom found to be necessary for cars recharged overnight only. With a 16-hour recharger (83 percent of the simulated EVs re- ceived a full recharge, and 90 percent reached at least 90 percent state of charge). Little recharge energy would be purchased during the daytime and early evening, so time-of- use rates would not substantially penalize those with 16- hour rechargers. These and other factors in charger design are being systematically evaluated in a program of battery charger development sponsored by EPRI. 1 983 SAE Transactions 830620. Phenolic disc brake pistons - the weight reduc- tion alternative. G. L. Harmon, J. F. Limberg, and P. J. Schreiner, Automotive Control Systems Group - North America, The Bendix Corp. Significant cost and weight reduction can be made by re- placing chromium-plated steel brake caliper pistons with pistons molded from glass reinforced, mineral filled, nova- lak type phenolic pistons (phenolic). During development testing and evaluations since 1976, Bendix ACSG has iden- tified important design parameters necessary to successfully incorporate this weight reduction opportunity. This paper will outline the historical data and information obtained during the development process which led to the applica- tion in production disc brakes. 1983 SAE Transactions 830621. Design-development, phenolic disc brake piston. John E. Emmett, DUREZ Resins &amp; Molding Materials, Occidental Chemical Corp. More than 25,000,000 phenolic disc brake pistons have been produced since first introduced in 1976. This innova- tive use of a non-metallic material continues to provide performance advantages over the chrome-plated steel it re- placed. Phenolic pistons have been approved, or are being evaluated, by brake and automotive engineers, worldwide. To achieve this broad acceptance and to meet brake performance demands, it was necessary to introduce and implement several modifications and additions to the origi- nal piston design concept. This paper will describe several of the improvements and demonstrate how they improved the quality of the piston. 830622. Thermal expansion of phenolic brake pistons. J. Mark Mersereau, Engineering Plastics Develop- ment, Rogers Corp. The linear coefficient of thermal expansion of glass fiber reinforced phenolic materials for automotive brake pistons is influenced by the method of measurement, the size of the specimen, the orientation of the specimen in the test fixture, and by the thermal history of the part. 1983 SAE Transactions 830624. (P-121) Improvement of pedestrian safety: influ- ence of shape of passenger car-front structures upon pedestrian kinematics and injuries: evalua- tion based on 50 cadaver tests. C. Cavallero, D. Cesari, and M. Ramet, ONSER, Laboratoire des Chocs et de Biomécanique, Bron, France; P. Bil- lault, P.S.A. SA^CITROËN - Centre Technique - VELIZY; and J. Farisse, B. Seriat-Gautier, and J. Bonnoit, Faculté de Médecine - Laboratoire d'Anatomie - Marseille. Faced with the importance of road accidents involving pe- destrians struck by passenger cars (18% of those killed in road accidents in France), an experimental programme of vehicle/pedestrian impact analysis has been since 1979 de- veloped. The programme is an example of teamwork be- tween doctors and engineers. The theme of this paper is to compare the influence of different vehicles used upon the consequences of impact, at a speed of 32 km/h and on the basis of tests with cadavers. The results of this research show that there is a great similarity between the vehicles used. In spite of the differ- ences of mass, of profile, of bonnet length, and of the posi- tion and the shape of the front bumper, the variations in terms of injury consequences, as well as the impact kine- matics, are difficult to weigh up. The improvement of pedestrian safety implies either changes affecting small areas and necessarily having limited effects, or alterations to the parts of the vehicles that are struck by pedestrians, such alterations involving character- istics that are specific to this type of protection. 110</page><page sequence="92">830625 - 830632 830625. (P-121) Design aspects of energy absorption in car pedestrian impacts. Robert Kaeser and J.- Michel Devaud, Institute for Lightweight Struc- tures, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. The car-pedestrian impact is formulated as a design task for the engineer designing a car front. Pedestrian load toler- ances are defined in an appropriate form for design. A two dimensional mathematical model with assumed deformable car surface is used to determine the movement of the pe- destrian during the collision, the locations and velocities of impact. The dynamic load bearing capacity of materials and car body components is determined using an impact pen- dulum. With the described design procedure an experimental front was defined, built and tested in full scale crash tests. Results are presented. Emphasis is laid on sim- plicity of design methods as well as in analysis in experi- mental testing. 830626. (P-121) Benefits from changes in vehicle exterior design - field accident and experimental work in Europe. S. J. Ashton and G. M. Mackay, Acci- dent Research Unit, University of Birmingham, England. A brief review of pedestrian injury research in Europe is made. The circumstances of pedestrian accidents are de- scribed and particular attention is given to the location of the pedestrian's initial contact with the vehicle exterior and to the speed of the vehicle at impact. The dynamics of pedestrian impact are described. Some data on the pattern of pedestrian injury is presented and the general cause of pedestrian injury considered. The influence of bumper height, bonnet height, bumper lead and front structure compliance on pelvic and leg injuries is considered. The influence of vehicle design on vehicle contact head injuries is examined. Consideration is given to the likely benefits to pedestrians that could accrue from changes in vehicle exte- rior design. 830628. Microprocessor clutch control. G. L. Falzoni, Fiat Car Co.; and E. Pellegrino and R. Troisi, Fiat Research Center. The automatic control of a normal production mechanical clutch has the objective of increasing driver comfort in urban traffic. Such a device will require a well suited con- trol strategy and a very careful experimental analysis to ensure correct and reliable operation during the start of the vehicle and gears shifting operation. To approach this prob- lem, Fiat Research Center has developed on Fiat Panda 30 a microcomputer based control system that drives an ap- propriate clutch pneumatic actuator. This paper illustrates, in some details, the pneumatic-mechanical actuation sys- tem, the sensors used, the control strategy and the electronic controller structure. 830629. Vehicle road testings of brake linings - present status in Japan. Kazuhiko Aoki, Akebono Brake Industry Co., Ltd. Various methods to evaluate lining characteristics by road test, both governmental and industrial, are reviewed. Japa- nese Automobile Standards (JASO) are established cover- ing wide range of tests. This standard is widely accepted by vehicle manufacturers, but still there are items not defined in this standard, and some of the manufacturers like to modify the standard for various reasons. It is intended that JASO will cover all aspects of road test procedure and be adopted by all Japanese manufacturers. We hope further that this standard will serve for the rationalization and harmonization of international standards like ISO and vari- ous regulations like ECE, FMVSS, Japanese Regulations, etc. 830630. Fuel tank running losses - a pre-control evapora- tive emission baseline. Michael W. Leiferman and Stuart W. Martens, General Motors Corp. Prior to nationwide installation of evaporative emission controls in 1971, a significant quantity of hydrocarbon va- pors was lost from fuel tank vents during vehicle operation. Earlier published quantifications of that emission source/mode were based on test protocols which predated and differed significantly from the now well established 1975 Federal Test Procedure for regulatory emission measurement. This paper reports the results of a series of running loss evaporative emission tests on a fleet of 1970 cars. The testing was designed to provide experimental data under conditions consistent with the regulatory test. Un- controlled baseline values of 6.7 g (0.9 g/mi) for 1970 cars and 6.0g (0.8 g/mi) for 1960 cars are consequently pro- posed as benchmarks from which to measure the extent of evaporative emission control accomplished by today's auto- mobiles. 1983 SAE Transactions 830632. Softening in weld heat affected zone of dual phase steel sheet for automotive wheel rim. Ka- zutoshi Kunishige, Nobuyuki Yamauchi, Takao Taka, and Noriaki Nagao, Central Research Lab- oratories, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd. Dual phase steel offers potential for wheel weight reduction, but has not been completely succeeded, in part, because of a localized necking or a fracture during rim fabrication. This failure should be related to a softening in the weld heat affected zone (HAZ). This paper investigates mechanical properties through microstructural change produced in the HAZ of as-rolled dual phase steel and finally suggests a practical solution. The softening, caused by heating the steel up to Acl in the HAZ, is found to be affected not only by tempering of martensite, but also by the variation of hardness in ferrite matrix. Moreover strain aging as well as work hardening due to up-setting stage during the flash welding also con- Ill</page><page sequence="93">830632-830639 cerns this problem. Coiling temperature in manufacturing as-rolled dual phase steel has a large effect on the conditions of ferrite and martensite. Control of the temperature is of great importance to avoid such a localized necking or a fracture in the HAZ. 1983 SAE Transactions 830633. Some vehicle factors related to type and severity of pedestrian injuries. Arthur C. Wolfe and James O'Day, Highway Safety Research Insti- tute, The University of Michigan. About 8,000 pedestrians are killed each year in the United States and probably another 180,000 are injured. This paper reports on an analysis of 1978 and 1979 New York pedes- trian accidents to try to find any relationships between vehi- cle factors and pedestrian injury severity and location. In these data trucks and vans were found to be associated with more severe pedestrian injuries than passenger cars. How- ever, within the passenger car category vehicle weight and injury severity were not clearly related. And few meaning- ful relationships were found between aspects of the passen- ger car front end configuration or the past production use of "soft" materials and pedestrian injury severity or loca- tion. 830634. High pressure tanks for alternative fueled ve- hicles. John F. Hawkins, Luxfer Holdings Ltd. Rigorous design criteria, qualification and release testing are essential to meet the requirements for compressed natural gas tanks in passenger automobiles. The origins and history of aluminum high pressure gas cylinders are reviewed, culminating in the development of the filament would cylinder. The ultra light weight wrapped aluminum cylinder combines ideal properties for auto appli- cations. 830635. Fatigue life prediction scheme for carburized members subjected to in-phase multiaxial str- esses. Golam M. Newaz, Owens-Corning Fiber- glas Corp. A dimensionless fatigue life parameter (Ecrmax ea)1/2/o"'f is developed for the correlation of fatigue data of carburized and core material. It is shown that the Smith-Watson- Topper parameter (E crmaxEea)1/2 can be generalized to the form (E crmax€a)1/2/cr'f to account for the fatigue strength differentials of dissimilar materials such as the core and case-core interface. Fatigue data generated using circum- ferentially notched specimens (Kt = 1.46 and Kt = 2.22) was successfully correlated to the core material fatigue data using this parameter at low stresses. From these observa- tions, a scheme is proposed to predict low-stress fatigue life of a carburized member experiencing multiaxial stresses based on the core material fatigue response only. 1983 SAE Transactions 830636. The digital engine concept. Lawrence W. Evers, Mechanical Engineering-Engineering Mechanics Department, Michigan Technology University, Houghton, MI. In most conventional engines the fuel supply system at- tempts to distribute equal amounts of fuel to each cylinder in any quantity between idle and maximum. The digital engine concept is an alternative fuel management system in which the fuel is delivered to the combustion chambers in quantums. This is accomplished by having multiple digital fuel injectors in each combustion chamber. Each injector when activated delivers a fixed amount of fuel or when deactivated it delivers none. The fuel delivery level is estab- lished by the selection of injectors which are activated. The most appropriate configuration for a digital engine is a two stroke loop scavenged stratified charge two stroke engine. The strategy for controlling the fuel delivery and the ex- pected benefits of a digital engine are discussed. 830638. History of lighting test development. George E. Meese, In Cooperation with the SAE Lighting Committee. This document is intended to provide some background on the evolution and development of the current SAE Stan- dards and Recommended Practices relating to automotive lighting devices. Although varying with device, material, and intent, this paper addresses the Lighting Committee's methods for arriving at specific levels and features. Lighting standards differ in origin, content and appli- cation from most technical standards. They involve the psycho-physiological aspects of vision as well as the physi- cal properties of lighting devices. Since they are sometimes referenced by public regulatory bodies, it was anticipated that this paper might be helpful to those using these stan- dards to understand the origin and factors which affected their development through the years. 830639. Energy saving steel bars for hot forging. Yutaka Tsuchida, Nobukazu Suzuki, and Tadahisa Aka- sawa, Nippon Steel Corp. Products R&amp;D Labs. Ausforging, in which quenching is performed direct from the high finishing temperature of forging, is one of the energy saving heat treatments. A disadvantage is that it results in degradation of impact toughness especially in low-alloy steels of relatively high Mn content. Ti treatment, which consists of controlling the amounts of Ti and N addition, solidifying in continuous casting process, and breaking down the blooms at appropri- ate temperatures, was found to improve the impact tough- ness of ausforged and tempered specimens through both preventing grain growth at forging temperatures and ac- commodating grain boundary segregation. Ti treatment was also applied to vanadium-containing steel subjected to air-quenching (air-cooling from the finish- ing temperature of forging), and a higher level of impact toughness was successfully achieved by air-quenching. 112</page><page sequence="94">830641 - 830647 830641. New applications for zinc from a new zinc tech- nology. Gene O. Cowie, Pioneer Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Co. Zinc, which has served the automotive industry for five decades, is reemerging as an engineering material and reen- forcing its position as a decorative material. Ongoing re- search and development by the zinc industry is document- ing the engineering properties of zinc alloys and placing this information within reach of the designer. This paper presents an overview of the progress in alloys, processes, and product development achieved by the industry in the last decade. Several new lightweight, cost effective applica- tions, which are now possible with the new technology, are described. 830642. Emissions from heavy duty vehicles before and after tune-up. John J. Pinto and Leonard Arono- witz, City of New York Dept. of Environmental Protection, Bureau of Science and Technology, Mobile Systems Division. Exhaust emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen from a large sample of model year 1959 thru 1977 gasoline powered heavy duty vehicles were measured. Chassis dynamometer driving cycle measure- ments were made with laboratory grade instrumentation, and idling measurements were made with inspection- station-type instruments. Emissions were measured and fuel economy calculated with the vehicles in as-received condi- tion and also after their engines were tuned to manufactur- ers' specifications. The results should be useful for planning or evaluating heavy duty emissions control programs. 830643. Contribution to the development of a concept of driving mechanics for commercial vehicles. A. Mischke, E. Goehring, P. Wolsdorf, and E. C. von Glasner, Daimler-Benz AG. In the following essay, vehicle, and test stand related measuring and calculating methods will be introduced which have proven to be a suitable basis for the discussion of the criteria of driving mechanics for commercial vehicles. Because of the progress of electronics development these methods are reliable and quickly performed today. In connection with tire and brake characteristics, which are the basis for measuring driving maneuvers, and with the knowledge of axle and wheel movement, a pur- poseful and physically correct evaluation of the driving be- havior of vehicles is possible. With the aid of complex mathematical vehicle substitution systems it is already possible to accurately estimate tendencies in the pre- development stage of a vehicle. 830646. Effect of operating conditions on the particulates from a single cylinder diesel engine. Henry Ri- chard Deighton Simpson, II, Bath Iron Works; and Barbara Mary Andon, William George Thil- ly, and Joe Merrill Rife, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Particulates were collected from the exhaust of a single cylinder diesel engine at different speeds and fuel-air equivalence ratios. The filters were rated to capture 99.99% of all particulates &gt;0.3 microns in diameter. Samples were taken at 1500 RPM and equivalence ratios varying from about 0.2 to 0.7, and at an equivalence ratio of about 0.3 and engine speeds varying from 1000 to 2500 RPM. A base point with an equivalence ratio of 0.3 with an engine speed of 1500 RPM was repeated several times to establish the expected test variation of the particulate data. The particu- late properties investigated were the total mass of particu- late produced per mass of fuel burned, the mass fraction of extractable organic material in the sample, and the muta- genic potency of the extract as measured by a bacterial bioassay. Variation in fuel-air ratio (engine load) affected the particulate and extractable organic production much more than variations in engine speed. The ratio of mass of partic- ulates produced was three to four times higher at both high and low equivalence ratios, than in the equivalence ratio range between 0.3 and 0.6. At low equivalence ratios, the particulates had a soluable fraction approximately five times higher than mid-range. The soluable fraction de- creased rapidly until the equivalence ratio reached 0.4 re- maining relatively constant above that point. The muta- genic potency of the extract was constant across both speed and equivalence ratio ranges within the accuracy of the bioassay. 830647. The role of nitrogen oxides in the wet and dry deposition of acidity. William E. Wilson, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Tri- angle Park, NC; and Rudolf B. Husar, CAPITA, Washington Univ., St. Louis, MO. Both sulfur and nitrogen pollutants may contribute to acidi- fication of the environment. Measurements indicate that nitric acid is an important contributor to the acidity of snowmelt but that sulfuric acid is the major contributor to rain acidity. In summer nitrate may be utilized by biological processes which effectively neutralize one hydrogen ion per nitrate utilized. In the winter these processes may not be rapid enough to utilize the nitric acid in snow-melt before it reaches lakes and streams. Therefore, NOx may be of con- cern during the winter, especially in regard to acidification of lakes and streams and spring fish kills. A budgeting exercise for SO2 and NOx leads to an estimate that passen- ger cars contribute 5% of annual wet deposition of acidity in the U.S., 8.5% of total (wet plus dry) acid deposition, and 1 1 % of the acidity in snowmelt, as measured at several sites in the rural, northeast U.S. 113</page><page sequence="95">830648 - 830655 830648. Hydraulic accumulator technology boosts transit bus fuel economy. Archie M. Riviera, Booz«Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. An investigation into the use of current hydraulic accumu- lator technology to regenerate braking energy in urban transit buses indicates that this system can improve vehicle fuel economy by approximately 50 percent. This savings plus that achieved through extended brake life can mean nearly $70,000 saved per vehicle over a 12-year lifetime. Of the four system approaches investigated, that em- ployed by the Technical University of Denmark is described in detail. It has the highest commercialization potential and would require only a short-term development program be- fore introduction. It is also widely applicable to the transit bus retrofit market. A theoretical analysis of the energy available for regen- eration during the transit bus duty cycle; a computer simu- lation of system performance; and a cost/benefit analysis are discussed. Included is an extensive bibliography result- ing from a worldwide literature search that produced over 240 papers on the subject. 1983 SAE Transactions 830650. Policies on productivity - some lessons from agri- culture? James D. Shaffer and Vernon L. Soren- son, Michigan State University, Dept. of Agricul- tural Economics. Since 1940 technological change in agriculture has led to substantial increases in productivity and significant changes in farm structure. Over this period labor productivity in- creased about 6 percent per year, and farms have increased in size. In 1940 about 15 percent of the U.S. work force was in agriculture; by 1980 this had declined to 3 percent. Pro- ductivity gains and the movement to scientific industrializa- tion of food production and distribution have contributed greatly to the improvement in real per capita incomes for the society as a whole. Productivity gains, however, involve changes and adjustments that affect people; existing skills and capital become obsolete and lose value. The gains and costs from change that occurs often are not equitably dis- tributed. The policy problem in an industrial democracy is to promote productivity increase while at the same time mitigating adverse consequences that flow from changes that alter the level and distribution of incomes, wages and relative prices. 830651. High swell gasket technology - the modern sys- tem approach. William D. Hughes, Technical Di- rector, Southland Industries Inc. High swelling gasketing materials are now being used in certain flange situations. This paper critiques how nonswell- ing gasketing materials fail in use in order to demonstrate how a controlled high swell gasket material concept is effec- tive. A discussion of the physical and chemical make-up of a specific high swell rubber and cork composite gasket ma- terial forms a more complete understanding of how these materials function in application. Additionally, certain ap- plication problems are avoided by some redesigning of the gasket flange assembly. 830652. A model for absorption and desorption of fuel vapour by cylinder lubricating oil films and its contribution to hydrocarbon emissions. J. C. Dent and P. A. Lakshminarayanan, Dept. of Me- chanical Engineering, University of Technology, Loughborough, UK. The absorption and desorption of fuel by cylinder lubricat- ing oil films has been modelled using principles of mass transfer. Henry's Law for a dilute solution of fuel in oil is used to relate gas to liquid phase fuel concentrations. Mass transfer conductances in gas and liquid phases are consid- ered, the former via use of Reynold's Analogy to engine heat transfer data, the latter through assuming molecular diffusion through an effective penetration depth of the oil film. Oxidation of desorbed fuel is assumed complete if the mean of burned gas and lubricating oil film temperatures is greater than 1100K. Below this value the desorbed fuel is considered to contribute to hydrocarbon emissions. Comparison with engine test data corroborate the ab- sorption/desorption hypothesis. The model indicates the equal importance of gas and liquid phase conductances. 830653. The SAE Lubricants Review Institute - purpose and operation. C. C. Colyer, Lubrizol. The keystone of the SAE/ASTM/API tripartite effort to insure the quality of commercial lubricants is the "Engine Oil Performance and Engine Service Classification Sys- tem," published as SAE J 183, which describes these per- formance requirements. A major element in this effort is the ASTM test monitoring system dealing with the calibration and monitoring of test facilities to assure that engine tests are conducted according to the procedures described by ASTM. Equally important is the SAE Lubricants Review Insti- tute (LRI) which deals with the specification conformance of candidate products for approval by the U.S. Military. Since many such candidate products also meet the require- ments described by SAE J 183 and are marketed in the private sector, the results of the LRI recommendations also impact upon commercial oils. This paper describes the background and operation of the LRI and the process by which performance of candidate engine oils and gear lubri- cants is reviewed. 830655. The protection of occupants of private cars in head-on collisions and its control by legislation. P. E. Waters, Vehicle Standards and Engineering Division, Department of Transport (United Kingdom). 114</page><page sequence="96">830655 - 830661 The use of the Part 572 dummy in crash testing is reviewed, noting that the variability of the results obtained from crash tests is unsatisfactorily high. The procedures lack flexibility to check all of the possibly important vehicle impact config- urations and we are a long way from establishing reliable biomechanical data to cover the types of injury and popula- tion variability that need to be considered. It is concluded that this type of testing is not suitable for legislative pur- poses. An alternative is to use an integrated regime of simple, controlled subsystem tests calibrated from in-depth accident data. Calibration against accident data takes better account of the variability of the user population than can testing with a fiftieth percentile dummy and bypasses the difficulties in- herent in the integrated test. As an example of this method, a previously unpublished study of ECE Regulation Number 12 (FMVSS 203) is used. 830656. Properties of induction heat-treated high- strength spring wire. Kazuhiro Kawasaki, Yo- shiki Seto, Takao Yamazaki, and Toshio Hijikata, Neturen Co., Ltd. In order to increase the fuel economy of automobiles, ef- forts are continuing at weight saving. For suspension springs, a new high-strength Si-Cr steel (SAE 9254) wire were developed by an application of induction heat treat- ment technique. The wires (ITW) with diameters of 7 to 14 mm with fine micro structure, good surface and less decar- burization were attained by rapid heating and short hold times during austenitization. In spite of very high tensile strength from 1770 to 2060 MPa., ITW shows high ductil- ity in tensile, torsion and impact test, and these properties provide excellent cold formability. Coil springs cold worked from ITW showed superior fatigue life (torsion stress r=637±490 MPa., over 3 X 105 cycles) and high sag re- sistance. This high performance makes it possible to pro- duce suspension springs that have the same performance as conventional ones but are 10-20% lighter. Both suspen- sion and emergency brake springs made from ITW have been confirmed by laboratory studies in the United States, to conform to the respective standards and offer weight saving. 830657. Micro-controlling of steel quality through an in- novative steel making process. Masatoshi Ozawa and Norioki Uyehara, Daido Steel Co., Ltd. A lately established melting-refining-casting process for special steel and their qualities are described in this paper. The process consists of electric arc furnace melting, ladle furnace refining, vacuum degassing and continuous casting in this order. Such a complicated process has been put in the practice for the first time to manufacture particularly automobile steels. One of the advantages of this process is the reduction of impurities such as oxygen and sulfur oxygen is evacuated during vacuum degassing treatment and sulfur is controlled through ladle furnace refining. As a consequence, cold for- mability is improved significantly. Mechanical reliability can be increased as well, and especially, it should be note- worthy that stress corrosion cracking of high strength fastn- ers is able to be prevented by the reduction of sulfur. Consistent quality is another major advantage of the process. This is achieved with the minute control of chem- istry through ladle furnace refining and vacuum degassing process. Continuous casting is also contributed to improve consistency through minimizing of segregation during so- lidification. An uniform-hardenability-steel and an uniform-heat treatment-distortion steel are examples of automobile steels taking this advantage. 830659. "Electro Gyro-Cator" new inertial navigation system for use in automobiles. Katsutoshi Taga- mi, Tsuneo Takahashi, and Fumitaka Takahashi, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd., Wako Center. The Electro Gyro-Cator allows a driver to monitor his pro- gress, plot and follow courses to a destination, select alter- nate routes, and drive more safely on unfamiliar roads or at night. Employing a sealed helium gas-rate gyro, the Electro Gyro-Cator offers visual display (CRT display) of a car's present location, direction and route, with overlay maps for fast, simple route selection and monitoring. The primary elements of the unit include trip and direction sensors, a 16-Bit central processing unit, a CRT display screen and a collection of transparent overlay maps fitted to the screen. 1983 SAE Transactions 830660. The Driver Guide System. Kenichi Mitamura and Satoru Chujo, Electric Equipment Design, Section No. 2, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; and Tetsuo Senoo, Electrical System Test Section, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. The Driver Guide System fills the much needed function of route guidance in today's society. This system uses terres- trial magnetism to detect the position of an automobile and to guide it to its destination. Differing from other such systems which are under development, this system does not require land installations. At the time of development, the greatest problem was how to control the strong magnetism of body panels and the magnetic field given off by electrical equipment in order to achieve a high degree of accuracy in the detection of subtle terrestrial magnetism. We have de- veloped a highly practical system through the application of a wide range of technology in circuitry and a structure and the effective use of software. 830661.

Improvements to cruise controls utilizing micro- processor technology. Peter G. Blaney, Zemco, Inc. A second generation digital cruise control system has been developed which boasts improved performance, more func- tions, lower cost and improved safety features. This paper discusses the problems encountered with designing a digital cruise control system and some practical solutions. A unique method of measuring speed is described which provides an order of magnitude improvement in reso- lution over previous methods. A discussion of new features available is included and a comprehensive safety system featuring "exclusive-or" brake detection and "redundant brake" safety backup is also described. 1983 SAE Transactions 830663. Suspension design for optimum road-holding. A. G. Thompson, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia. Formulas are developed for the optimum spring and damper rates in conventional car suspensions. The formulas are based on the minimization of the mean-squared tire forces on random roads and take into account the body k2/ab ratio. The suspension spring rates are optimally tuned in relation to the tire radial rates and the optimal spring and damper rates are independent of speed. Frequency locus methods are employed in the theory which is based on a linear half-car model. An example demonstrates the impor- tant effect of body centre of gravity position on suspension performance and overall static stiffness. 1983 SAE Transactions 830665. (SP-539) An experimental study of cavitation in hydrodynamically lubricated journal bearings - part II: bearing behaviour. M. O. A. Mokhtar and M. E. Ameen, Mechanical Design and Pro- duction Dept., Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University, Egypt. The present experimental work investigates journal bearing performance and its correlation to the oil film extent. The performance characteristics; namely: journal eccentricity and attitude angle together with the frictional traction have been measured under different oil feeding designs to include single oil inlet hole and axial groove. With the oil being introduced from different positions relative to the load vec- tor, the bearing behaviour could also be recorded and ana- lysed. Bearing behaviour has shown to be governed by the oil film behaviour and an optimum position of the oil inlet port should be assigned within the divergent bearing clear- ance to attain the best performance. In comparison with boundary conditions used in theories, the observed and re- corded oil film boundaries are in favour of recent theoreti- cal approach. 830666. The pencil nozzle - past, present &amp; future. Lewis E. Tolan and Thomas D. Hess, Stanadyne, Inc., Diesel Systems Group. Nearly twenty-three million 9.5 mm diameter Pencil Nozz- les have been sold in its short twenty year history. Through the years, the design changes have kept pace with the in- creased performance demands of the small and medium sized diesel engines. Installation details are simpler and less costly than conventional nozzles, including locations be- neath the engine valve cover. Standard servicing techniques for this unique design have been in use since the beginning. The new Slim Tip (5.4 mm diameter) version offers addi- tional installation advantages as engine bore diameters de- crease and speeds increase. 830667. The role of adhesives and sealants in fitting cylin- drical parts. Robert A. Valitsky, Loctite Corp., Newington, CT. Anaerobic adhesives have been shown to be an effective assembly method for cylindrically fitted parts. Traditional methods of assembly, such as press fits, keys, and splines, require costly machining to maintain tolerances between parts to maintain joint integrity. Anaerobic adhesives pro- vide additional strength to mechanical methods of assembly and also seal the joint against leakage and corrosion. 830668. The use of video displays in inspection. Douglas J. Funke and Jan L. Ditzian, Calspan Corp. Human Factors issues surrounding the use of video displays in inspection are considered in this paper. These issues are organized in five categories: characteristics of the target as seen within the context of the search environment; charac- teristics of the presentation; characteristics of the environ- ment in which the inspection takes place; characteristics of the inspector; and organizational characteristics. The The- ory of Signal Detectability (TSD) and Arousal Theory are used throughout this paper to relate two types of errors - missed signals and false alarms, to the inspection situation. The inspection of hand carried baggage by the airlines is used as an example to illustrate many issues raised in this paper. 1983 SAE Transactions 830669. Review of the Uniform Product Liability Act. George Z. Libertiny, Consultant. The Uniform Product Liability Act attempts to present one unified cause of action for injuries to persons and damage to property caused by products.

The Volkswagen research car - Auto 2000. Ulrich W. Seiffert and Hans Wilhelm Grove, Volk- swagenwerk AG. This paper describes the research project which led to the development of the Auto 2000. The purpose of the project was to develop a passenger car to meet the needs of the motoring public in the year 2000. Special attention was given to the reduction of fuel consumption with advanced aerodynamics and the use of alternate materials, improve- ments in vehicle safety, reduction of exterior noise and the use of the microcomputers in different areas. The research resulted in a passenger car with an aerodynamic drag factor of .25, two different engine concepts with superchargers, transmission options with unique energy management systems, all of which combine for good driving performance and fuel economy. In addition, safety and environmental factors were considered and the results indicate that this vehicle fulfills the transportation demands for the year 2000 and beyond. 1983 SAE Transactions 830672. The SI engine concept of the Volkswagen "Auto 2000". Peter Walzer, Klaus-Dieter Emmenthal, Klaus Stamm, and 1st van Geiger, Volkswagen- werk AG. The VW Research Car Auto 2000 with the spark ignition (SI) engine is intended to achieve a high level of driving performance at low fuel consumption rates while simultane- ously emitting the lowest possible levels of exhaust emis- sions and noise. This report contains the considerations that led to selection of a 1,06 liter engine with charging by a positive displacement charger. It gives the findings of pre- liminary studies of the combustion chamber, charging pro- cedure, knock limit control, and low idle-speed level. The vehicle achieved a top speed of 186 km/h, acceleration from stand still to 100 km/h in 1 1.7 seconds, and a fuel efficiency of 16.9 km per liter with the selected engine and a four- speed automatic transmission. At the same time, the pre- sent European limits for exhaust emission and noise regula- tions were fullfilled. 1983 SAE Transactions 830673. Large area liquid crystal display for automotive application. K. Fahrenschon and W. Wiemer, AEG-TELEFUNKEN Professional Tube Divi- sion, Ulm, Germany. AEG-TELEFUNKEN have developed to the latest tech- nology a liquid crystal display in a large format for an automotive instrument cluster. The instrument with a size of 300 mm X 150 mm X 15 mm consists of one single display with integrated driver ICs, soldered directly to the glass substrate, a lighting system for operation at night and separately mounted evaluation electronics.

Engine research, development, and acquisition strategy for U.S. Army ground vehicles. Paul C. Glance and Richard Munt, US Army Tank- Automotive Command, Research and Develop- ment Center. The US Army conducts Research, Development &amp; Acquisi- tion programs on a wide variety of tactical and combat vehicle types. Available resources for the research and de- velopment (R&amp;D) of candidate engines, however, are far more limited. Consequently, there is need for a manage- ment strategy by which the US Army Tank- Automoti ve Command (TACOM) can more effectively direct the lim- ited Department of Defense (DOD) R&amp;D resources to those programs which will provide the greatest benefit to the overall effectiveness of the DOD. In response to this need, TACOM has evolved an en- gine R&amp;D two-fold strategy. The first part of the strategy is the limitation of TACOM's R&amp;D efforts to that range of engines wherein there are no cost-effective commercially available engine options. The second part of the strategy is the goal to develop an objective, quantifiable methodology which integrates the highest priority goals into an overall evaluation of the cost/combat (or operational) effectiveness of candidate engines. 830675. In-vehicle test results of the Eagle-Picher, Globe, and Westinghouse batteries. R. Hewitt and J. Bryant, California Institute of Technology, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA. Three full-sized developmental batteries were tested with electric vehicles: the Eagle-Picher nickel-iron battery, the Globe ISOA lead-acid battery, and the Westinghouse nickel-iron battery. Constant-speed and driving schedule tests were done on a chassis dynamometer. Several aspects of battery performance were evaluated, including capacity, recharge efficiency, voltage response, and self-discharge. Each of these three batteries exhibited some strengths and some weaknesses. 830685. (P-127) Chrome plating simplified: the two bus bar system. J. W. Doshier, American Airlines, Inc. We will be discussing the age of the two bar hard chrome plating system and comparing the time and work produced using the two bar system versus the three bar system. In concluding, we hope to bring out the advantages of work produced, amount of space needed in a shòp, quantity of power sources needed and the overall savings to a company by replacing the three bar hard chròme plating system with the two bar system. 117</page><page sequence="99">830686-830694 830686. (P-127) A new zinc-nickel electroplating process: alternative to cadmium plating. Grace F. Hsu, Boeing Materials Technology, Boeing Commer- cial Airplane Co., Seattle, WA. New environmental regulations all over the world encour- age the use of alternatives to cadmium plating for corrosion-protection systems used on steels. Boeing patents are pending on a non-cyanide replacement zinc-nickel alloy electroplating process with superior properties, including low hydrogen embrittlement and good corrosion protection, for use on high-strength steels and other substrates. An- other advantage of this process is low cost because conven- tional electroplating tank facilities can be used and waste treatment cost can be reduced. The feasibility of this zinc- nickel plating process has been successfully demonstrated in the laboratory and is scheduled for manufacturing scale-up during 1983. 1983 SAE Transactions 830687. (P-127) AeroNiki® brush plated coatings. Gary W. Smith, Research and Development, Sifco Se- lective Plating, Cleveland, OH. Selective "Brush Plating" is a process gaining wider ac- ceptance in the airline/aerospace industries. Applications are no longer limited to mere "touch ups" of cadmium, but are being expanded to include heavy build-ups with other metals on larger areas. As the process applications were expanded, it became evident that the most widely used brush plated coatings, the high speed neutral or alkaline Nickels, would not be acceptable for most applications. Deposits from such solutions were highly stressed, constantly showed evidence of surface to base cracking, and poor adhesion in bend/fracture tests. With the development of the sulfamate based AeroNiki® plating solutions, these traditional plating problems have been eliminated. Success- ful plating, however, requires "state-of-the-art" brush plat- ing techniques, including an auxiliary piece of equipment, known in the trade as the AeroNiki® Sump. 830691. (P-127) Improved equipment productivity in- creases applications for ion vapor deposition of aluminum. D. E. Muehlberger and J. J. Reilly, McDonnell Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. Aluminum coatings by ion vapor deposition (IVD) repre- sent the leading edge of finishing technology. IVD equip- ment has achieved the status of a proven production process offering both reliability and cost effectiveness. The process was originally developed to protect steel against corrosion without hydrogen embrittlement and to prevent exfoliation corrosion of the countersinks in alumi- num structure joined with steel fasteners. However, the IVD process and aluminum coating are extremely versatile, and the variety of applications has greatly expanded. Oper- ating experience over the past decade has led to equipment and process refinements. Increased throughput and greater reliability of the IVD equipment (called Ivadizers®) have improved productivity leading to cost effective production operations. The growing number of IVD installations include aero- space manufacturers and military overhaul facilities. In ad- dition to the United States, coating facilities have been es- tablished in France, England, Canada, Japan and Australia. These facilities include independent job shops which offer contract coating service. 1983 SAE Transactions 830692. (P-127) Compact, high efficiency plasma spray guns for jet engine coatings. Richard T. Smyth, METCO Inc. The design and operation of a new range of compact, high efficiency guns is described. Data is presented to show that high quality coatings are obtained using low operating power levels and that narrow spray patterns are produced. The use of this new technology to produce coatings for jet engine components, such as, burner cans or combustion liners, turbine blade areas, and fan disc slots, is discussed. 830693. (P-127) The effect of stress on the properties of electroless nickel-phosphorus deposits. Glenn O. Mallory and Dan Altura, Allied-Kelite Div., Witco Chemical Corp. The internal stress of electroless nickel (EN) deposits is shown to be the sum of two components, intrinsic and thermal. A method of measuring the stress components is discussed. The stress is shown to be dependent on the chem- istry of the plating bath as well as the phosphorus content of the EN deposit. The corrosion behavior of EN deposits is shown to be dependent on stress and the near-surface phosphorus con- tent. The effect of EN deposits on fatigue strength of steel is also discussed. 1983 SAE Transactions 830694.

Wood, AB2MT Consultants, Inc., Coral Gables, FL; Kenneth Chacey, Southern Div., Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Charleston, SC; M. H. Dent, Du-Den-Co., Inver- ness, FL; and Tara Singh, Resource Applications, Inc., Vienna, VA. During past several years, the electroplating industrial waste has attracted attention due to level of pollutants found in the waste stream, and difficulty associated with treatment and cost of waste disposal. The Environmental Protection Agency has enacted recent regulations to control the discharge from plating facilities and estimates that 140 million pounds of metal pollutants will be prevented from being discharged to publicly owned treatment works. The changes in metal prices, cost of treatment/disposal, and 118</page><page sequence="100">830694-830710 future environmental regulatory goals, dictate that water pollution control technology for plating industry be reeva- luated. New alternatives should be developed which take advantage of resource recovery, minimization of sludge pro- duction and are compatible with new standards. This article discusses a recent evaluation of a Naval Air Rework Facility electroplating shop including electroplating process engi- neering, optimal plating performance flow reduction and innovative technology for treatment/recovery compatible with new standards based on Best Available Technology. 1983 SAE Transactions 830695. (P-127) Thermal spray robots. Gary Irons and Louis George, METCO Inc. Robots are finding wide acceptance in plasma, combustion and arc spray applications. They offer improved coating quality, increased productivity, reduced costs and remove the operator from the spray environment. The latter is im- portant since thermal spraying is noisy, bright and produces fumes and dust. The requirements for thermal spray robots are dis- cussed. A number of robotic spray installations are pictured and described. Some of the robots are commercially availa- ble models and others were designed and built specifically for thermal spraying. Integration of the robot into a com- plete thermal system is emphasized. 830705. Aviation gasoline: issues and answers. Cynthia T. Zook, Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Environment and Energy. There is a strong trend in the petroleum industry toward the restricted availability and potential elimination of grade 80 aviation gasoline. Users often have no recourse but to use higher grade avgas. The primary impact of using higher leaded avgas in engines designed for grade 80 is economic: higher maintenance and operating costs for users. However, safety records indicate a number of accidents involving air- craft fueled with auto gas or misfueled with jet fuel. This paper reviews ongoing government and industry efforts to reduce or prevent such accidents. 830706. Autogas flight test in a Cessna 150 airplane. Harry Zeisloft, Experimental Aircraft Associa- tion. Because of the availability and cost problems in supplying 80 grade aviation gas to the users, and because of the high maintenance costs and lowered reliability when using 100LL aviation gasoline in 80 octane, aircraft engines, flight tests were conducted to determine airworthiness of the air- craft and compliance with Federal Air Regulations when using automobile gasoline. On the basis of these tests, FAA approval has been given for the use of unleaded regular automobile gasoline for all Cessna 150 airplanes powered with Teledyne Conti- nental Motors 100 hp. engines. No changes were required to the airframe, engine or operation of the aircraft. 830707. Final evaluation of multi-viscosity oils designed for aircraft reciprocating engines. Weldon E. Garrelts, University of Illinois. Six, one hundred eighty horsepower aircraft piston engines have been operated through their normal overhaul life using three different ashless dispersant multi-viscosity aircraft oils. Two of these oils achieved their multi- viscosity charac- teristics by utilizing some synthetic base stock while the third utilized additional viscosity-index (V-I) improver. The performance of these three oils was compared with that of a conventional, single-grade AD oil in six identical control aircraft engines. The results of this test indicate that multi- viscosity oils provide improved cold-weather starting, less consumption, and comparable wear rates to the six control engines. 830708. The calculation of two-dimensional transonic flow over aerofoils including boundary layer and wake effects. Prakash Bansod and Tri Pham, Ca- nadair Ltd. A brief description is given of the development of a weak interaction method for calculating transonic flows over aer- ofoils. Viscous effects are introduced by changing the boundary conditions on the aerofoil surface and wake. The wake thickness and curvature are taken into account. The method is evaluated against experimental data for eight aerofoils with sharp and thick trailing edges. Comparisons between experiment and theory are presented for turbulent boundary layer parameters, pressure distribution and drag. 830709. Studies of light-twin wing-body interference. W. G. Thomson, Beech Aircraft Corp.; and W. H. Wentz, Jr., Wichita State University. The results of an analytical study of aerodynamic interfer- ence effects for a light twin aircraft are presented. The data presented concentrates on the influence of a wing on a body (the fuselage). Wind tunnel comparisons of three fillets are included, with corresponding computational analysis. Re- sults indicate that potential flow analysis is useful to guide the design of intersection fairings, but experimental tuning is still required. While the study specifically addresses a light twin aircraft, the methods are applicable to a wide variety of aircraft. 830710. Unconventional commuter configurations: a de- sign investigation. R. Srivatsan and Jan Roskam, University of Kansas Flight Research Labora- tory. The results of a design investigation of some unconven- tional airplane configurations are reported in this paper. The viability of designing canard and 3-surface airplanes to meet commuter airline needs was investigated. This study was conducted on an airplane designed to carry 30 passeng- ers on 600 n.m. stage lengths, cruising at 0.6 Mach number at an altitude of 28,000 feet. 119</page><page sequence="101">830710-830717 A test ride quality evaluation was also carried out. This indicated that, although considerable performance improve- ment was possible over existing airplanes of the same type, active ride augmentation systems were needed to achieve airliner levels of comfort. All three airplanes looked good in terms of mission fuel consumption and climb terms. The 3-surface configuration managed to edge out the other two in those same terms. 830711. An improved method for predicting lateral- directional dynamic stability characteristics. H. S. Bruner, Beech Aircraft Corp. Current methods of predicting lateral-directional dynamic stability using closed form small perturbation equations are often inaccurate. Flight test data usually shows Dutch-roll characteristics; in particular, to be poorer than estimates. Two assumptions are inherent in these current methods that are inappropriate to General Aviation-type aircraft: First, that the control surfaces are fixed and, secondly, that the rate-of-change in sideslip (beta dot) stability derivatives are insignificant. These assumptions are discarded in this new method, and the system of equations describing the aircraft motion are expanded. Solution of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this system of partial differential equa- tions yield the characteristics of the airplane and control system motions. Comparison of the predictions with the new method to that of the old show significant differences. Particularly noteworthy is the strong influence of the beta- dot terms on the damping of the Dutch-roll mode. 1983 SAE Transactions 830712. Design consideration for lighting modern com- mercial aircraft. Paul H. Greenlee, Midland-Ross Corp. The configuration of high performance modern commercial aircraft vary considerably from one model to another. The location and design of lighting fixtures, particularly for exterior lighting, are affected significantly by these config- uration differences. It is important to consider lighting dur- ing the early design stages of the airplane to maximize quality and usefulness of the resulting lighting systems. Lighting plays an important part in aircraft safety, crew performance and passenger comfort. 830713. Aircraft night lighting systems. Chesley S. Piero- way, PRAM Program Office, HQ ASD, Wright- Patterson AFB, OH. The Air Force has developed several aircraft cockpit light- ing techniques that will reduce glare, windscreen reflec- tions, improve visibility and are compatible with Night Vi- sion Goggles. These techniques utilize a combination of microencapsulated Electroluminescent lamps, light control film, light filters, and dimmers to control light placement, wavelength, and intensity. These techniques are applicable to military, commercial, and general aviation aircraft. 830714. Fail-operational DAFCS for business/commuter aircraft. Robert C. Eslinger, Sperry Flight Sys- tems. The fail-operational Digital Automatic Flight Control System (DAFCS) for business/commuter aircraft devel- oped by Sperry serves as the cornerstone in the new genera- tion integrated cockpit. The DAFCS makes maximum use of digital technology by providing increased integration, performance, and flexibility along with an associated reduc- tion in size, weight and power consumption. Tying together the DAFCS, sensors, and display systems is the Avionics Standard Communication Bus (ASCB). This bi-directional bus provides the interface with a minimum of hardware and aircraft wiring. This paper discusses system operation and DAFCS architecture along with a unique approach used to obtain fail passive performance in a single flight guidance computer. 830715. The missing element in wind shear protection. Sam Saint, Consultant to Safe Flight Instrument Corp. An examination of a series of crashes attributed to hazard- ous low level wind shear indicates most pilots do not have the necessary information or training to avert disaster when severe wind shear is encountered during take-off or landing. The most effective deterrent to aircraft fatalities due to shear encountered during these critical times is an airborne wind shear warning system which provides a voice alert to the pilot about to face the danger in adequate time for him to execute the proper escape maneuver. Modern technology has demonstrated the ability to measure the vertical compo- nent of a shear along with the horizontal, thereby providing a dependable warning free from false alarms. 1983 SAE Transactions 830717. Flight investigation of natural laminar flow on the Bellanca Skyrocket II. Bruce J. Holmes, NASA Langley Research Center; Clifford J. Oba- ra, Kentron International; and Gerald M. Gre- gorek, Michael J. Hoffman, and Rick J. Freuhler, Ohio State University. Two major concerns have inhibited the use of natural lami- nar flow (NLF) for viscous drag reduction on production aircraft. These are the concerns of achieveability of NLF on practical airframe surfaces, and maintainability in operating environments. Previous research in this area left a mixture of positive and negative conclusions regarding these con- cerns. While early (pre- 1950) airframe construction meth- ods could not achieve NLF criteria for waviness, several modern construction methods (composites for example) can achieve the required smoothness. This paper presents flight experiment data on the achieveability and maintainability of NLF on a high-performance, single-propeller, composite airplane, the Bellanca Skyrocket II. The significant contri- bution of laminar flow to the performance of this airplane was measured. Observations of laminar flow in the propel- 120</page><page sequence="102">830717-830727 1er slipstream are discussed, as are the effects of insect con- tamination on the wing. These observations have resulted in a new appreciation of the operational feasibility for achiev- ing and maintaining NLF on modern airframe surfaces. 830718. Determination of installed reciprocating engine cooling requirements through flight test. Stan J. Miley, Donald T. Ward, and Michael N. Kelley, Department of Aerospace Engineering, Texas A&amp;M University. A flight test procedure has been developed which will pro- vide a systematic means of working cooling installation problems for air-cooled reciprocating engine aircraft. The procedure is based upon the NACA Cooling Correlation analysis which resulted from the radial air-cooled engine development program over forty years ago. The derivation of the method and results from flight test programs to prove the method are reported in this paper. 830719. Data acquisition system and methodology for high angle of attack parameter estimation. M. Sri-Jayantha and Robert F. Stengel, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ. A digital data acquisition system that has been flight tested in a Schweizer 2-32 sailplane, and the algorithms designed for high angle of attack parameter identification are de- scribed in this paper. The system is portable and self- contained. Inertial sensors are mounted in a strapdown unit. Two Kiel-probes are used for airspeed measurement. "Off-the-shelf' microelectronic components are configured to operate as a multiprocesssing system. The on-board com- puting power is used to monitor the sensor and support system and to improve flight test effectiveness. The Estimation-Before-Modeling technique has been selected for parameter identification. A time history of a flight test maneuver that will be used in the estimation of the aerody- namic parameters also is presented. 830720. Wing modification for increased spin resistance. H. Paul Stough, Daniel J. DiCarlo, and Eric C. Stewart, NASA Langley Research Center. A simple wing leading-edge modification has been devel- oped that delays outer wing panel stall, thus maintaining roll damping to higher angles of attack and delaying the onset of autorotation. The stall angle of attack of the outer wing panel has been shown to be a function of the span wise length of the leading-edge modification. The margin of spin resistance provided by the modification is being explored through flight tests. Preliminary results have been used to evaluate spin resistance in terms of the difference in angle of attack between outer wing panel stall and the maximum attainable angle of attack. 830723. Devices for improvement of controllability at stall. Michael L. Hinson, Gates Learjet Corp. The stall characteristics of Leaijet aircraft are discussed in terms of the aerodynamic phenomena which determine the stall behavior. A number of devices are described which have been flight tested in attempting to improve controlla- bility at stall. Theories are offered to explain the effects of each device. Wind tunnel test data are compared with some of the flight results. 830724. Protection against the direct effects of lightning strikes for a carbon fiber composite aircraft. D. H. McClenahan, Lear Fan Ltd. Reno, NV; and J. A. Plumer, Lightning Technologies, Inc., Pitts- field, MA. Presently, many manufacturers are replacing aluminium with fiberglass, Kevlar, and carbon fiber composites (CFC) to take advantage of the fuel savings allowed by weight reduction. It is well known that lightning strikes may cause severe damage to unprotected composites, so protective measures must usually be incorporated. Presently available methods involve application of a layer or ply of conductive material to the laminate, which compromises the original weight savings and sometimes imposes manufacturing and repair difficulties. These drawbacks have been especially severe for thin laminates, where the weight of the protective layer is a significant portion of the entire laminate. Thus, an effort was begun to develop more efficient lightning protec- tive methods for CFC laminates. The outcome was a new CFC material that incorporates conductive filaments to disperse stroke and energies and to limit damage but retains the same physical and structural properties as unprotected CFC. The weight increase to this modification is extremely small, and no additional procedures are necessary in the aircraft manufacture. 830727. Solid-state rate sensor technology and applica- tions. Richard O. Ayres, Watson Industries, Inc. Mechanical rate gyroscopes have become ubiquitous in al- most all types of systems where angular velocity measure- ments are desired. Until fairly recently, a lack of competi- tion has made the mechanical gyro a virtual necessity in many measurement and stabilization applications. However, in the past few years, solid-state rate sensors have begun to infiltrate markets previously controlled by the mechanical sensor. In many applications fluidic and Coriolis force rate sensors can offer improved performance and/or reduced cost. While these devices overcome many limitations of their mechanical counterpart, each type has unique operational characteristics. Fundamentals of operation for each type of sensor are discussed in this paper. Theoretical and practical operating features of each type are discussed. Typical specifications for present-day sensors are presented, along with an appli- cation for which solid state gyros are ideally suited. 121</page><page sequence="103">830728 - 830734 830728. The microprocessor and the airplane: the evolu- tion of an intelligent trim system. Robert L. Nuckolls, III, Electro-Mech Inc., Wichita, KS. In this paper, the writer will review the need for, and the importance of a powered and intelligently-controlled air- craft pitch trim system. Two types of trim motors and their respective advantages and disadvantages will be presented along with motor to microprocessor interface techniques. Input command monitoring features for protecting the in- tegrity of wiring and switches will be discussed. A variety of pitch-trim operating modes will be described, along with a discussion of the sensors needed to feed flight dynamics data to the pitch-trim controller. A fail-passive design phi- losophy will be presented with the goal of achieving more useful operation along with less rigorous certification re- quirements; and, finally, electronic hardware and redun- dant software will be described which will take advantage of microprocessor technology to provide an impressive cost/performance ratio in complex system design. 830729. New test techniques and analytical procedures for understanding the behavior of advanced propellers. George L. Stefko, Lawrence J. Bober, and Harvey E. Neumann, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Lewis Research Cen- ter, Cleveland, Ohio. New analytical procedures and experimental techniques are being developed to improve the capability to design ad- vanced high speed propellers. Some results from the propel- ler lifting line and lifting surface aerodynamic analysis codes are compared with propeller force data, probe data and new laser velocimeter data. In general, the code com- parisons with data indicate good qualitative agreement. A new rotating propeller force balance demonstrated good accuracy and reduced test time by 50 percent. Results from three new propeller flow visualization techniques are shown which illustrate some of the physical phenomena occurring on these propellers. 1983 SAE Transactions 830730. Results from performance and noise tests of model scale propellers. Patricia J. W. Block and Ruth M. Martin, NASA Langley Research Cen- ter, Hampton, VA. This paper summarizes some of the results obtained in a study of two .25 scale propellers tested in the Quiet Flow Facility at the NASA Langley Research Center. Both per- formance and noise measurements were made over advance ratios from .4 to 1.3, for thrust loadings up to 22 lbs/ft2 and tip Mach numbers up to .82. These data were obtained for validation of noise and performance prediction theories. Scale effects on performance were also examined using data obtained from other tests at .566 and full scale for the two propellers. Finally, the effect on performance and noise of a wake entering the disk plane was examined. 830731. Aeroacoustic flight test of four single engine propellers. G. M. Gregorek, R. L. Newman, and G. T. Black, The Aeronautical &amp; Astronautical Research Laboratory, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. A flight test program has been conducted at the Aeronauti- cal and Astronautical Research Laboratory (AARL) of The Ohio State University to measure performance and acoustic characteristics of four propellers designed for use on single- engine general-aviation airplanes. Three of the propellers were designed to reduce acoustic noise, while the fourth was a standard production propeller used for comparison. The tests show that noticable reduction in near-field noise was achieved at a constant propeller rpm, and that compa- rable aircraft performance may still be maintained. 830733. Acoustic evaluation of three turbo propellers. G. M. Gregorek and C. J. Woan, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio; and K. D. Korkan, Texas A &amp; M University, College Station, TX. Three turbo-propellers were test flown on a Gulfstream Aerospace Commander 695 to measure their acoustic signa- tures in the near field, as measured by a wing mounted microphone, in the far field as recorded by a ground station in fly-over tests, and in the cabin as monitored by two microphones located in the cabin. Despite differences in airfoils, twist, and planform, the three-bladed propellers exhibited similar pressure-time traces in the near field; therefore, overall sound pressure levels are nearly equal for all propellers at consistent power and air speed. Several hundred acoustic signatures obtained from these propellers during the fly over tests and at pressure altitudes of 10,000 and 20,000 ft for cruise and full power and with both en- gines operating and with the right engine shut down have been digitized for ready access and are available to acousti- cians desiring this experimental data. 830734. Evaluation of the acoustic intensity approach to identify transmission paths in aircraft structures. M. J. Crocker, K. E. Heitman, and Y. S. Wang, Ray W. Herrick Laboratories, School of Mechan- ical Engineering, Purdue University. The new two-microphone acoustic intensity technique has been applied to the determination of the transmission paths of sound into an airplane cabin interior. It appears that, provided sufficient care is taken in the measurements, ac- curate quantitative information can be obtained with this technique on the dominant paths of acoustic energy trans- mission. This information can be used to make design changes to the fuselage wall to reduce interior cabin noise. 1983 SAE Transactions 122</page><page sequence="104">830735 - 830744 830735. Structureborne contribution to interior noise of propeller aircraft. Vern L. Metcalf, Army Struc- tures Laboratory, Hampton, VA; and William H. Mayes, NASA Langley Research Center, Hamp- ton, VA. Measurements obtained for ground tests on a Twin Otter aircraft show that structureborne noise is a major contrib- utor to the interior noise level. The structureborne source was the propeller blade wake and tip vortex interaction with the wing and contributes at the blade passage fre- quency and its harmonics. 1983 SAE Transactions 830736. Fokker 's activities in cabin noise control for pro- peller aircraft. E. H. Waterman, D. Kaptein, and S. L. Sarin, Fokker B. V., Schiphol, Netherlands. This paper mainly deals with the noise control measures which have been applied successfully on the propeller- driven Fokker F27 Friendship aircraft. The measures de- scribed include the application of dynamic absorbers, dou- ble walls, damping treatments and synchrophasing. Provisions for suppressing rattles are also discussed. 830737. The prediction of interior noise of propeller- driven aircraft: a review. John F. Wilby, Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc., Canoga Park, CA. Recently developed analytical models for the airborne transmission of propeller noise into airplane cabins are re- viewed. Different aspects considered are the representations for the exterior pressure field, fuselage structure and cabin volume. The analytical models require that the excitation be described in terms of amplitude and phase so that the struc- tural response can be calculated. The acoustic power flow into the cabin is then determined in part by the coupling between the modes of the structure and volume. Noise re- ductions provided by multi-layer sidewall treatments can be modeled by means of the impedance transfer method where, for simplicity, the materials are assumed to be lo- cally reacting. No general analytical model for propeller noise transmission into an aircraft cabin has been validated under flight conditions. However, laboratory tests have pro- vided some initial verification of methods under develop- ment. 1983 SAE Transactions 830741. Airfoil stall prediction with 2-D wind tunnel and 3-D flight verification. Donald C. Howe, Gates Learjet Corp. A number of modified nine percent thick airfoils were tested two dimensionally in the Ohio State University 6" X 12" (15.2 cm X 30.5 cm) airfoil tunnel at .25 Mach and flight Reynolds numbers. Two dimensional analyses were run on the same airfoils using modified versions of the Lockheed Analysis code. Maximum lift comparisons are made with both the laminar and turbulent separation pre- dictions. Results show good correlation of maximum lift and stall characteristics with the test data. Maximum lift analysis has been carried to three dimensions where com- parisons are made with flight test data on several of the airfoils. 830742. Predicting aircraft performance degradation due to ice accretion. M. B. Bragg and G. M. Gre- gorek, The Ohio State University. An analytical method to predict the performance degrada- tion of aircraft with ice accretion is presented. Early re- search on airfoil icing and the effects of ice on aircraft are reviewed. Data on the performance degradation of airfoils due to ice are presented as they apply to the aircraft per- formance analysis. A computer code has been written and results are discussed. 830743. Development of a propeller afterbody analysis with contracting slipstream. S. P. Sparks, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA; and S. J. Miley, Texas A&amp;M University, College Station, TX. A developmental study was performed of an analytical me- thod to predict the aerodynamic behavior of propeller after- bodies in a contracting slipstream. An existing axisymmet- ric body panel code was used as the basis. The slipstream was modeled by a finite set of vortex rings lying on a de- formable tube boundary. Relations were formulated giving the ring strength in terms of the propeller operating condi- tions. An experimental program was conducted to investi- gate the accuracy of the method. The static pressure distri- bution of an axisymmetric afterbody was measured in the presence of a propeller slipstream. The results showed good agreement at high advance ratios, but increased in error as the advance ratio was reduced. The error was traced to losses in slipstream total pressure adjacent to the afterbody due to stall of the inboard section of the test propeller. 830744. Ride quality systems for commuter aircraft. Terry A. Hammond, Shailesh P. Amin, and Da- vid R. Downing, The University of Kansas Cen- ter for Research, Inc., Flight Research Labora- tory, Lawrence, KS. The airline deregulation in 1978 and the resultant increase of commuter airline passengers, generated a great deal of effort toward making the commuter aircraft as efficient and comfortable as the larger major airliners. One area where the commuter lags far behind is in ride smoothness. This paper examines the state-of-the-art in active ride augmenta- tion, specifically in terms of the feasibility of its application to commuter aircraft. A literature survey was done, and the principal results are presented here through discussion of three different RQAS designs and the advances in related technologies. Recommended follow-on research areas are discussed, and a selected commuter RQAS design configu- ration is presented. 123</page><page sequence="105">830745 - 830751 830745. Aircraft crash safety research in Australia. Stu- art Sarrailhe, Aeronautical Research Laborato- ries, Melbourne, Australia, Department of De- fence Support. The Aeronautical Research Laboratories of the Department of Defence Support, in conjunction with the Department of Aviation has conducted a limited program of Crash Safety Research. Principal aspects of this program are reviewed. They included investigations into the performance of con- ventional and energy absorbing restrain systems, the strength of cabins and the response of light aircraft seats to vertical acceleration. Results are presented and some im- proved experimental techniques are suggested. 830747. Crashworthiness analysis of aircraft seats using Program SOM-LA. David H. Laananen, Simula Inc.; and Lawrence M. Neri and Charles E. Nuckolls, Federal Aviation Administration Tech- nical Center. Program SOM-LA (Seat/Occupant Model - Light Aircraft) has been developed for use in evaluating the crashworthi- ness of aircraft seats and restraint systems. It combines a three-dimensional dynamic model of the human body with a finite element model of the seat structure. The seat anal- ysis has the capability to model large displacements, non- linear material behavior, local buckling, and various inter- nal releases for beam elements. The final phase of validation included simulation of dynamic tests of production general aviation seats. Model predictions are compared with test data for one of these seats. 1983 SAE Transactions 830748. Impulse analysis of airplane crash data with con- sideration given to human tolerance. Huey D. Carden, NASA Langley Research Center, Hamp- ton, VA. An impulse-momentum analysis was conducted of crash deceleration pulse data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) crash dynamics program on general aviation airplanes and transport crash data availa- ble in the literature. The purpose of the analysis was to correlate crash data with flight parameters at impact. In the analysis, assumptions made to simplify the com- plex crash scenario led to uncoupled equations for the nor- mal and longitudinal floor impulses (product of decelera- tion and time) in the cabin area of the airplane. Analytical expressions for structural crushing during impact and for the airplane horizontal slide-out were also determined. Good agreement was found between the experimental and analytical data for the general aviation and transport air- planes over a relatively wide range of impact parameters. Three applications are presented: (1) post-crash evaluation of crash parameters, (2) development of a crash scenario, and (3) correlation with human factors considerations. 1983 SAE Transactions 830749. Crash impact characteristics of helicopter com- posite structures. James D. Cronkhite, Bell Heli- copter Textron, Inc., Fort Worth, TX. This paper describes the results of a research program to investigate the crash impact behavior of helicopter compos- ite structures designed to meet the U.S. Army's crashwor- thiness requirements specified in MIL-STD-1290. The pro- gram included design, fabrication, and crash testing of two full-scale composite helicopter cabin sections. The drop test conditions for the two cabin sections were representative of the 42 ft/s vertical crash impact velocity requirement specified in MIL-STD-1290 assuming the landing gear had slowed the aircraft from 42 ft/s to 30 ft/s prior to fuselage contact. Roll attitudes of 0° (flat) and 20° were used in the two cabin drop tests. Test results from both drop tests indi- cated that the strong protective shell structure around the occupants remained intact; structural deformation was re- stricted to the areas designed to crush and absorb energy; and most important, the excellent post-test condition of the cabin protective shell structure and the performance of spe- cially designed energy-absorbing components demonstrated that the Army's crashworthiness requirement could be met by a composite structure. The KRASH computer program was used for the crash impact analysis of the cabin sections. Load-deformation characteristics of key energy-absorbing components were derived from design support test data and used as input to the KRASH analysis. Based on the good crash impact performance of the composite cabins and the comparison of analytical and test results, KRASH proved to be a useful and reasonably accurate analysis tool for the design of helicopter composite structures to meet the Army's crashworthiness requirements. 1983 SAE Transactions 830750. Techniques of model propeller testing. R. M. Bass, Dowty Rotol Limited. Full scale propeller tests are extremely expensive and lim- ited by the availability of large high speed tunnels. The use of models is an alternative, and considerable experience has been obtained from recent British programmes involving small models, the design and construction of which, includ- ing the use of composite materials, are discussed. A series of performance tests carried out on a model in a variable density tunnel at flight Mach, numbers, with measurement errors of less than ±1.0%, provided some observation of the influence of Reynolds number. The lower speed results, compared with full scale tunnel data, after correction for scale effects, showed very close agreement. Samples of results from another comparative test pro- gramme are included showing similar agreement both aero- dynamic and acoustic. 830751.

Some results are reviewed with respect to predicted propeller performance.

Colclough, Dowty Rotol Limited. Gloucestershire, England. The effect of an operating environment upon composite propeller blades has been studied by exposing both com- posite panels and propeller blades to a variety of environ- mental effects. This paper reviews these tests and shows that the propeller blade is adequately protected against lightning strike, impact damage, erosion and atmospheric exposure. Dynamic and static mechanical properties were determined on test pieces cut from a composite propeller blade which had been in service for over ten years on a passenger carrying hovercraft. These tests revealed that little change had occurred to the composite material in that period of time. 830755. Design of the low vibration turboprop powerplant suspension system for the DASH 7 aircraft. G. O. Hrycko, The de Havilland Aircraft of Canada, Limited. Larger turboprop aircraft are finding increased acceptance with today's fuel-conscious operators. However, these air- craft must also appeal to the air traveller who has become accustomed to the vibration free environment of turbojets. This requirement of minimum propeller-induced vibration results in a conflicting constraint for the designer of a flut- ter free installation. Described in this paper is the two-plane engine mounting scheme used successfully in de Havilland's DASH 7 commuter aircraft. The suspension system meets the design objectives of low transmissibility, adequate whirl flutter margins and minimized landing loads. 1983 SAE Transactions 830756. The TFE731-5: evolution of a decade of business jet service. Karl R. Fledderjohn, Aircraft Propul- sion Engines, Garrett Turbine Engine Co., Phoe- nix, AZ. The Garrett TFE731-5 turbofan engine was built on the extensive experience gained from earlier models of the TFE731 family. Ten years and five million hours of operat- ing time, combined with the experience gained in manufac- turing over 4000 TFE731 engines, served as the basis for the new TFE731-5. This report highlights some of the more important elements that contributed to the design and de- velopment of the -5 model. Special emphasis is placed on subtleties of the actual operational environment, the importance of a well planned and well executed continuing airworthiness program, and the importance of timely field experience feedback to the engine designers and developers. 1983 SAE Transactions 830757.

A new sensor approach to an attitude/heading reference system. David L. Hemmel, Rockwell International Corp., Collins Avionics Group, Melbourne, FL; and Billie F. Rider, Rockwell International Corp., Collins Avionics Group, Ce- dar Rapids, IA. This paper describes a strapdown attitude/heading refer- ence system (AHRS) designed to provide significant ad- vancements in weight, volume, and cost. As such, it may be expected to replace conventional gyroscopic devices in transport category aircraft used in business aviation and government applications. In addition to unusual design objectives in the areas of weight, volume, and cost, the AHRS has met requirements for performance and reliability that equal or exceed that which would typically be experienced with the array of separate gyros and accelerometers which it can replace. These design achievements have been made possible by employing a new technology rate/acceleration sensor. The sensing principle is based on the fact that spinning piezoe- lectric elements measure coriolis accelerations which are proportional to applied rates. Additional piezoelectrical ele- ments permit the sensing of linear accelerations as well. The efficiency of combined rate and acceleration sensing, the high accuracy levels obtained, and the inherent simplicity of the design make this multisensor especially attractive for the AHRS application. Extensive environmental and flight test results have verified the basic measurement concept and shown that all design objectives have been achieved. 1983 SAE Transactions 125</page><page sequence="107">830760-830767 830760. TCAS cockpit interfaces. E. D. Hart and R. D. Stevens, Bendix Air Transport Avionics Div. The new Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) provides independent aircraft derived traffic and resolution advisories in the cockpit. Proper interpretation of this new information requires the crew to be familiar with new displays and the source of the information presented. This paper reviews the basic operation of TCAS to show how the advisories are developed. Then currently proposed displays are used to indicate how the information is pre- sented. Integration of the TCAS data with ground ATC information and some limitations in the TCAS advisories are discussed. 830761. Longitudinal flying qualities criteria for single- pilot instrument flight operations. Aharon Bar- Gill, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ (For- mer Graduate Student. Member of the Technical Staff, Israel Armament Development Authority.); and Robert F. Stengel, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ. Experiments to determine the flying qualities of more than a dozen dynamic configurations have been conducted using the variable-stability Avionics Research Aircraft. Particular attention was paid to variations in long-period longitudinal characteristics and their effects on the performance of sim- ulated IFR flights from takeoff through landing. Over the range of values tested, lift slope variations (-Zw) had the greatest effect on pilot opinion, workload, and tracking er- ror. Bounds for satisfactory flying qualities were found for three parameters: phugoid mode damping, stick force gradi- ent (with respect to trim airspeed), and pitch/airspeed gra- dient. 830763. Handling qualities of canards, tandem wings, and other unconventional configurations. Seth B. An- derson, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA. Over the years, a wide variety of aircraft configurations have been flown with varying degrees of success. A brief survey of the handling qualities of canard, tandem wing, and flying wing designs indicates that longitudinal stability and control, lateral/directional stability and control, and stall behavior of these concepts were important factors in achieving pilot acceptance. 830765. Pattern analysis of agricultural equipment. Ri- chard W. Whitney, Oklahoma State Univ., Agri- cultural Engineering Dept., Stillwater, OK; and Dennis K. Kuhlman, Kansas State Univ., Man- hattan, KS. A rapid pattern analysis system was developed at Okla- homa State University which samples the swath deposition from agricultural aircraft. A 30.5 m track holding a paper tape is sprayed with a fluorescent dye tracer. The spray pattern is analyzed by feeding the paper tape through a modified filter fluorometer which produces an analog volt- age proportional to the fluorescence on the tape. The volt- age signal is graphed, and stored digitally on floppy disk for later evaluation. The pattern analysis system has been used as a tool for correcting aerial application spray patterns, single nozzle pattern studies, and investigation of various spray pattern phenomena. 1983 SAE Transactions 830766. Damage tolerance of composite cylinders. Mi- chael J. Graves, Boeing Military Airplane Com- pany; and Paul A. Lagace, Massachusetts Insti- tute of Technology. The fracture of pressurized graphite/epoxy cylinders was investigated and their damage tolerance assessed. The cylin- ders were 610 mm (24 in) long and 305 mm (12 in) in diameter and were fabricated from Hercules A370- 5H/3501-6 prepreg cloth in 4-ply configurations: (0,45)s and (45,0)s. The cylinders were slit in the longitudinal di- rection and the critical flaw sizes for three pressure levels were determined. Experiments on coupons of similar con- struction loaded in tension were previously conducted. The critical flaw sizes for the cylinders were well predicted from the flat coupon data corrected for the effects of curvature. In addition, circumferentially-wrapped unidirectional plies of Hercules AS 1/3 50 1-6 tape of various stacking sequences were used as selective reinforcement on several (0,45)s cyl- inders. There reinforcing plies did change the path of dam- age but did not prevent catastrophic failure. 830767. Observations of severe in-flight environments on airplane composite structural components. Wil- liam E. Howell and Bruce D. Fisher, NASA, Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA. An investigation of the effects of severe in-flight weather environments on composite structures has been conducted as part of the NASA-Langley Research Center Storm Hazards Program. The on-going program uses an extensively-instrumented F-106B airplane to make thunder- storm penetrations. The vertical fin cap was chosen for the experimental composite structure because of the likelihood of lightning strike attachments and the ease of component replacement. Three components were flown and investi- gated. The first was the U.S. Air Force production glass/epoxy fin cap which was flame-sprayed by NASA with aluminum for lightning protection. The second fin cap was fabricated with Kevlar/epoxy fabric skins and used an aluminized glass cloth for lightning protection. The third fin cap was fabricated with graphite/epoxy fabric skins with no lightning protection. All three components were exposed to high rain rates and direct lightning strikes. The effects of the flight environments on the components were monitored visually and areas of interest photographed. The perform- ance of the three fin caps and any required repairs are reported herein. 126</page><page sequence="108">830768 - 830801 830768.

Shumaker, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, OH. Available data in the literature and test data were collected to determine predictive equations for the magnitude and wave shapes for lightning induced overpressures on aircraft structures. Mathematical models were developed for panel response from both normal and grazing incidence pressure pulses. The predictive models were compared to data of lightning overpressure damage on two general aviation air- craft. 830769. Some stochastic considerations in theoretical for- mulation of acoustic intensity method using two microphones. Gopal P. Mathur, Structural Dy- namics R&amp;D, Beech Aircraft Corp., Wichita, KS. The theoretical formulation of the cross-spectral density formula based on finite difference approximations is exam- ined in light of certain stochastic considerations. General expressions for mean square errors involved in estimating acoustic pressure and particle velocity for determining acoustic intensity are derived. It is shown that estimation of particle velocity using finite difference approximation is, in particular, not satisfactory even for very small microphone spacings. The results presented in this paper indicate the necessity of evolving more rigorous and stochastically sound estimation procedures for determining acoustic pressure and particle velocity. 830770.

Small, versatile remote controlled circuit breaker design complements next generation aircraft system requirements. Robert W. Peterson, Texas Instruments Inc. A new remote controlled circuit breaker (RCCB) has been developed to meet needs of both present and future aircraft electrical systems. The small size and actuation versatility of the new RCCB design allows system designers improved flexibility in designing distribution systems which reduce wire weight and is compatible with computerized bus man- agement concepts. Conventional RCCB's are applied in systems that sup- ply trip and reset signals from the flight deck via hard wired indicating and control units. The necessary logic circuitry is contained in each RCCB. New microprocessor controlled systems would provide operation from centralized logic via MUX busing to satellite interface modules. RCCB's used in this approach are inherently simpler, lighter, more reliable and economical. 830772. An experimental investigation of separated flow on a light twin engine aircraft. C. Osto wari, Te- xas A &amp; M University; and W. H. Wentz, Jr., Wichita State University. Force measurements, surface flow patterns and wake total pressure surveys have been obtained for a wing, wing-body, wing-nacelle and wing-body-nacelle configuration at typical pre- and post-stall angle of attack (10° and 16°), for a general aviation twin-engine airplane. The data includes separated regions and combined flow field models. The results indicate the presence of highly three- dimensional separated regions above and beyond the sur- face at post-stall condition. Based upon the present experimental data, combined flow field models have been proposed for each of the config- urations, at the pre-stall (10°) and post-stall (16°) angle of attack condition. In all cases, the flow is shown to be form- ing turbulent three-dimensional separation bubbles. These flow models should provide some guidelines for future ana- lytical modeling of separated flow associated with interfer- ing bodies. 830800. New technology and the engineer. Robert E.

This order of magnitude change in the kinematic syn- thesis method over the "thumb-tack and cardboard approach" is yet another excellent example of computer aided design. The LINCAGES© package demonstrates the modern approach to linkage design. 1983 SAE Transactions 127</page><page sequence="109">830803-830815 830803. Resin transfer molding - an update. Robert M. Riddell, Molded Fiber Glass Companies. Molded Fiber Glass has applied its matched metal die back- ground to resin tansfer molding. This has meant a quest for uniform part thickness and relatively fast cycles when com- pared with most resin transfer molders. This has not been obtained without problems. This paper outlines some of these problems and their solutions and also tries to give realistic crossover points between the hand lay-up, resin transfer molding, and matched metal die molding processes. 830804. Press molded thermoplastics. Layton L. Hinson, Jr., Arvin Industries, Inc., Arvinyl Div., Colum- bus, IN.

Blacksburg, Va. A brief description of the Finite Element formulation and its advantages are discussed. A review of past studies deal- ing with finite element application to soil-machine interac- tion problems and suggestions for future research are also included. 830807. Computer size and finite element analysis. R. Y. Bodine, A. O. Smith Corp. Application of the finite element method to engineering analysis began to propagate in the 1960's, using large main- frame computers as the vehicle for calculation. Introduc- tion of the minicomputers during the 1970's offered an alternative approach for performing such analysis, and an alternative approach for locating the computer itself. Cur- rent microcomputers may offer yet another approach to finite element analysis and computer accessibility. 830808. Finite element modeling via a CAD system. D. C. McMurray, A. O. Smith Corp. This paper concerns the utilization of a CAD system in the development of models for finite element analysis. The ca- pabilities of such systems provide inherent advantages in the consulting engineering business where products from a wide variety of manufacturers are analyzed. One of the primary advantages is the reduction in time required to develop and document a finite element model. That reduc- tion can be realized only after system familiarity is achieved - model development for non-trivial structures is not auto- matic. Examples of several models developed on a CAD system are included in the discussion. 830809. Engineering and manufacturing aspects of PTFE seals. Michael A. Savoia, The Mather Co./Fluo- rotec Div. PTFE has arisen as a practical and cost effective lip seal component. This has only come about through a thorough understanding of the relationship between the design pa- rameters of the PTFE seal and the functional aspects of PTFE processing and manufacturing. 830810.

A theft deterrent program for off-highway equip- ment. Robert M. Tunstall and C. Stanley Uska- vitch, Deere &amp; Co., Moline, IL. To deter theft of off-highway equipment, manufacturers must look at more than just putting padlocks on units. Most security devices can be overcome in some manner, given enough time. It then becomes a matter of establishing identification of the unit and determining rightful owner- 128</page><page sequence="110">830815 - 830825 ship. This requires having an identification number that is unique for each unit which can be readily found. If the pri- mary identification number has been removed, a cross- check of component identification is needed. In addition, the owner must have some form of proof of ownership that cannot be copied or counterfeited. 1983 SAE Transactions 830816. Impact-lost equipment heavy equipment theft. Hugh B. Goulding, Equipment Theft Informa- tion Program, Inc., Addison, IL. Descriptions of various methods of stealing off-road equip- ment and of defrauding Leasing and Rental Companies, Insurance Companies and Financial Institutions.

Bearing materials for earthmoving equipment. James H. Cooper, Jr., Garlock Bearings, Inc. There are many types of bearings available that can be used for Off-Highway types of equipment. In fact, so many, that they can be classed in such a manner that the static capac- ity, dynamic capacity, velocity limits and temperature capa- bility can be graduated to assist the designer in choosing a suitable material. A concise outline of both metal-backed, lubricated and self-lubricated bearings will be outlined along various types of self-lubricated, high-strength compo- sites. Guidelines to choose a material based on application data will also be reviewed. 1983 SAE Transactions 830819. Engineering thermoplastic cages for tapered roller bearings. Richard E. Cantley, Robert F. Cornish, and Richard O. Dimit, The Timken Co. Engineering thermoplastics have greatly improved over the last decade. As a result of these improved performance characteristics and their becoming more cost competitive with traditional cage materials, their use in tapered roller bearing cages has become a reality. Design flexibility, ligh- ter weight, resistance to handling damage, etc. make them attractive. This paper does point out certain characteristics of thermoplastics which must be taken into consideration thus influencing the choice of material and what environ- ments they can endure. Compatibility with lubricants at elevated temperatures, growth from moisture and thermal expansion, solvent resistance, impact resistance, strength and dimensional stability are the major considerations. Thermoplastics have found a place in the tapered roller bearing family. 1983 SAE Transactions 830820. Bucket wheel units for SYNCRUDE tar sands. Werner Rixen, Fried. Krupp GmbH, KRUPP INDUSTRIE- UND STAHLBAU. The Athabasca tar sands with an oil content of 626 X 109 barrels are mined since 1967 in large scale operation. The opening up work in SYNCRUDE's Mildred Lake Pit started in 1974. The selected mining method and the unfa- vourable climatic conditions require a tailor-made design of the bucket wheel units for SYNCRUDE. The design fea- tures resulting from the mining method are described and compared with the one bucket wheel excavators working in Lignite open pit mines. The dependency of design details from the climatic conditions is shown. 830821. Development of the Case 580D 4-wheel drive loa- der/backhoe. John Wm. Gass, J I Case, A Ten- neco Company.

An example using a tapered roller bearing is given. 1983 SAE Transactions 830825. Application of X-ray measurement to bearing failure analysis. H. Nakashima, K. Maeda, N. Tsushima, and H. Muro, NTN Toyo Bearing Co., Ltd. 129</page><page sequence="111">830825 - 830862 X-ray measurement is a very useful tool for bearing failure analysis. Compressive residual stress is created under the bearing raceway if bearings are used under a contact stress higher than the critical value. Residual stress distribution measurement of a used bearing enables to presume contact stress in service. Half height breadth of diffracted X-ray also changes with the fatigue of the material. Therefore X-ray measurement may estimate the degree of fatigue of a used bearing. Fracture surface of a fractured bearing has some- times a high tensile residual stress at the surface, from which we can presume the fracture toughness of the material and then calculate the fracture stress.

The history of the automobile's progress is one of harmony with society. Automobiles have progressed by applying to the maximum degree the available technologies of each era and seeking harmony between social needs, the needs of consumers and the state of road system development. The most critical and lasting issues in the automobile world will continue to be safety, the wise use of natural resources and protection of the environment. While it is necessary for automobiles to make their own contribution to the solution of these issues, it is also vital that automobiles be developed as a part of a total system in harmony with public invest- ment, such as road facilities. In particular, it is necessary that a radio communications link between automobiles and a traffic control network be introduced to enable driving that is safe, efficient and in good harmony with the environ- ment. In order to overcome these problems, it is necessary to actively engage in information and technology exchanges that transcend national boundaries and the bounds of tech- nical specialties, and at the same time introduce a wide range of advanced technologies. 830856. (P-139) Motor vehicle technology - progress and harmony - a practical approach. Graeme J. Long- bottom, President, SAE-Australasia, Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd, Australia. The paper provides an overview of the history of the Aus- tralian automotive industry with observations covering the effects of progress on both the industry and the Australian public. Over the years, Government bodies and consumer protection agencies have had a significant influence on shaping the industry. However recent years have seen strong trends developing, relating to methods of manufac- turing and the use of R &amp; D, which will impact on the Australian car of tomorrow. The conclusion is drawn that there is a clear direction for Australia to review its ap- proach to both R&amp;D and manufacture with co-operation and harmony being keys to the future of the industry. 830857. (P-139) More economic prosperity through in- creased technical exchange. Hu Liang, President, SAE of China. There is a long history of economic and cultural exchange among Pacific nations. Their hope today is to enjoy peace- ful coexistence and prosperity in spite of having different social systems. To ensure continued development of the nations and better lives for their peoples, the economic, scientific, technical and cultural exchanges must be strengthened. 830859.

This presentation deals with the interrelationship of auto- motive fuels, lubricants, and equipment as they have devel- oped from the beginnings of automotive technology to the present. It also looks briefly at the future of this relation- ship. In keeping with the meeting theme, "Motor Vehicle Technology: Progress and Harmony", the author shows how fuels and lubricants technology has progressed in har- mony with automotive technological developments. 830861. (P-139) Development of a dilute charge engine with electronically controlled pneumatic in- cylinder fuel metering. Michael McKay, Kim C. Schlunke, and Peter W. Simons, Orbital Engine Company, Australia. Details relevant to the development of a dilute charge, four- stroke automotive spark ignition engine are described. Fea- tures of the engine include electronic air and fuel manage- ment. Demonstrated performance features include higher output and improved octane sensitivity relative to the base powerplant. Mechanical hardware was developed to control pulsed fuel delivery to the engine under electronic control within a 3 milli-second time duration, with a degree of atomisation superior to commercially available diesel injec- tors. A linearised high response throttle servomechanism was developed. 830862. (P-139) TOYOTA electronic control system for a diesel engine. Hideo Miyagi, Masaomi Nagase, Jiro Nakano, and Mamoru Kobashi, Toyota Mo- tor Corp., Japan. In August, 1982, Toyota introduced a new diesel engine with an electronic control system. It allows for optimum control of fuel quantity, injection timing, idle speed, glow plug current and intake air flow. Consequently, great ad- 130</page><page sequence="112">830862 - 830868 vantages have been obtained such as high engine perform- ance, good fuel economy, good driveability, low engine noise and vibration. 830863. (P-139) High pressure fuel injection - a rational approach to diesel engine efficiency, emissions, and economics. N. John Beck, Robert L. Bark- himer, William E. Weseloh, William P. Johnson, Michael A. Calkins, and Christian G. Goohs, BKM, Inc., U. S. A. A new type of diesel fuel injection uses a simple, medium- pressure, common-rail system with pressure intensifier and accumulator type unit injectors with direct electronic con- trol to achieve high performance at low cost. The desirable features of high injection pressures with quantity and timing controlled directly by microprocessor are attained with a simple unique system. Data are pre- sented on performance, efficiency, emissions, and relative cost. It is concluded that electronically controlled high pressure injection offers a practical and economical solution for efficient combustion in diesel engines. 830864. (P-139) Ignition characteristics of the repetitive electric sparks. Kyung-Kook Cho and In-Seuck Jeung, Department of Aeronautical Engineering, Seoul National University, Korea. The ignition characteristics of single spark and repetitive sparks into a quiescent propane-air premixed combustible gas was investigated by using a capacitor discharge ignitor and a high voltage pulse generator, with the visualization of single shot schlieren photography. The results clearly demonstrate that the ignition limit of repetitive sparks is much wider than that of single spark and the ignition ability of repetitive sparks is superior to that of single spark. It is also shown that there exists a certain optimum spark delay time interval in the case of repetitive sparks. 830865. (P-139) Combustion processes and the state of gases in a divided chamber. Shoshi Shimizu, Ka- zunori Wakai, and Shinji Sakai, Gifu University, Japan. The mechanism of combustion in a chamber with an auxil- iary one is very complex and the mechanism has a great influence on the performances of an engine. Combustion processes in the chamber have been investigated by taking pressure, temperature, ion current and schlieren photo- graphs of the flame. It is found that the duration of com- bustion, histories of pressure and temperature distribution are greatly influenced by the configuration of the two cham- bers. But the effect of stoichiometry of the mixture is not so great because the mechanism of combustion is strongly af- fected by the speed and intensity of the jet. 830866. (P-139) Gasoline combustion chambers - compact or open? David Collins and John Stokes, Ricardo Consulting Engineers pic, England. A single cylinder research engine has been used to study a range of gasoline combustion chamber designs which have been divided into three categories open, compact and four valve. Measurements of fuel consumption and exhaust emissions are presented at full load and part load condi- tions, and a comparison is made of the best chamber from each category. At full load the performances of the three chambers were very similar at low speeds but at high speeds the superiority of the four-valve was clearly shown. At part load there were significant differences in the burn rate when operating at lean mixtures with the compact design showing the highest level and hence the most extended lean limit. The relationship between part load fuel consumption and full load octane requirement is presented as a method of comparing the relative performance of a range of combus- tion chamber designs. 830867. (P-139) Hot forging of powder metal automotive parts. Sang-Kee Suh, Korea Institute of Machin- ery &amp; Metals, Korea. Hot forging of powder metal preforms (P/M forging) is a process of growing interest and importance for the mass production of automotive parts. In spite of P/M forging's excellent reputation in the automotive industries, the tech- nology has yet to receive wide acceptance it deserves. This paper reviews the key areas of the P/M forging technology: process, material, mechanical properties, machinability and preform design. Some technical factors that have impeded the growth of P/M forging are discussed as a guide to future growth. New technologies are also introduced, and recommendations for the future research directions of these new technologies are made. 830868. (P-139) Some features of nodular cast iron crank- shafts used in the Chinese EQ140 series truck engines. Wang Xiran and Fan Huiching, The Sec- ond Automobile Works, Shiyan, Hubei, The Peo- ple's Republic of China. In the Chinese EQ140 series truck engines, nodular cast iron crankshafts are used. Though the works possesses a 12000 ton mechanical press, and therefore is able to pro- duce crankshaft forgings, nodular castings are prefered. Some 200,000 crankshafts have been installed in the en- gines, which are doing very arduous work in Chinese truck usage. As compared with a forging, the cost and equipment investment of a nodular cast iron crankshaft is lower. Ma- chinability is improved. Especially the anti- wear quality is appreciably better. 131</page><page sequence="113">830869 - 830875 830869. (P-139) The use of low-carbon, manganese, vana- dium boron steel (15MnVB) to make automotive high strength bolts and studs. Zhao De-yin and Li Zuo, The First Automobile Works, China. The 15MnVB steel is designed to be quenched and tem- pered at low temperature. Heavy-duty bolts made of this new grade steel have higher strength, better toughness and lower fracture transition temperature. Through years of practice, it can be concluded that the new material has better technological performance. Annealing for spheroidi- zation is generally unnecessary prior to cold-heading. The bolts have been shown to be guaranteed in good performance in mass production and long term application. 830870. (P-139) Effect of zinc coating on cosmetic corro- sion in automotive body panel. Toru Honjo, Sigeo Kurokawa, Hajime Kimura, and Toshio Irie, Ka- wasaki Steel Corporation, Japan. The corrosion of three-coated electrogalvanized steel (EG) and cold-rolled steel sheet (CR) has been investigated to evaluate their potential for outer side panels of automobile. It was found that, in the salt test, the average width of blisters on the three-coated EG was larger than that on CR. However, in the cyclic corrosion test, which is considered to simulate the actual dry and wet corrosion environment more accurately, CR showed less corrosion resistance, while EG showed high corrosion resistance, that is, no blisters or rust were found on the three-coated EG. 830871. (P-139) Corrosion protection fundamentals of metal-finished steel sheets for automotive appli- cations. Shigeyoshi Maeda, Joji Oka, and Yasu- hiko Miyoshi, Nippon Steel Corporation, Japan. Corrosion protection mechanism was investigated on newly developed-metal-finished steel sheets for automobile appli- cations. Such alloying elements to zinc as Ni, Co, Mn, Mg and Al retard oxygen reduction reaction because of their stabilizing effect of Zn(OH)2 films, leading to improved corrosion resistance. Wet adhesion of cathodic primed full painted system is governed by alkali-induced dissolution of phosphate and zinc coatings during electrocoating. Fe in coating layer improves wet adhesion because of its high alkali-resistance. Both Fe and Ni have a pore blocking ef- fect on phosphate films, with resultant a superior paint performance. The factors affecting perforation of jointed panels were also discussed. 830872. (P-139) Industrial lasers and applications. Zoltan L. Tuz, Chief Engineer, Laser Lab Australia Pty.

It briefly relates the special construction of the machine and tool, what quality level the process can attain and what effect it influences on heat treatment distortion and crystalline structure of the work piece. Finally it gives some rules of the change of the trace of contact area on the gear flank due to tool wear and predicts that wide spreading acceptance of the process will be expected. 830874. (P-139) A case study on the development of the automobile body industries in Indonesia. Wibi- sarto Setiadjat and Supandi, Metal Industries De- velopment Center, Indonesia. The automobile body industry in Indonesia is developed by the needs of motorized means of transportation, especially for passengers cheap enough to meet the consumer's buying power. To fill these needs, modifications on commercial ve- hicles into passenger vehicles or provisions for passenger space on special chassis had been carried out. It can be seen that basically body construction or mod- ification in the automobile body industry is but an extension of the automobile industry in general. At present, commercial vehicles are designed to run with higher speeds and lower fuel consumption. This situa- tion calls for a structure design that has to meet specifica- tions generally applied to automobiles, so as to enable it to perform equally well with the basic vehicles. In order to get automobile bodies that stay in step with technological progress in the automotive field, i.e. to guar- antee automobile body design that will comply with safety and comfort provisions, the first steps to be taken are those of grading up the automobile body industry based on their skills in structure design and in the manufacturing process itself. 830875.

(P-139) The prospects and introduction of in- dustrial robots. Katsuyoshi Takeuchi and Masa- nori Kajita, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., Japan. This paper will review the history of industrial robots over the past ten years and it will consider the factors behind their increased use as well as the results obtained. In the early stages of introducing industrial robots into the automobile industry, there were problems with their "crazy motion." In some cases, defective motors of the magnetic memory drums caused robots to malfunction, crushing both the workpiece and the robot itself. In other cases, the axle bearings were found broken when the robots were overhauled to correct their imprecise stopping. The robots at that time were not durable enough or reliable enough to meet the application requirements. Today - Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. uses 1,000 playback robots. Our vehicle body assembly division has become about 97% automated, and through their contribution the rate of automation has been increasing every year. 830877.

It is the same with the machining and assembling of engines, transmissions, etc., which have a longer product life and which are mass produced using many special pur- pose machines with high production capacities. In this report, the term "flexibility" is considered first. We expect a characteristic flexibility in a production sys- tems according to the products. Next, we would like to present a few examples of im- proved flexibility. 830878. (P-139) Turbocharging for the fuel efficient ur- ban car.

Microprocessor-based control technology has found wide- spread application in automotive engineering. Nissan has been studying the effective application of a microprocessor to an automatic transmission system. A new microproces- sor controlled automatic transmission has been introduced to meet the demands for better fuel economy and driveabil- ity. The microprocessor controls the optimum operation of the lockup clutch in all four speeds which provides im- proved fuel economy and driving performance. Engagement and disengagement of the clutch are carried out precisely without degrading shift quality. The other controls for down-shifting while coasting and automatic selection of the shift schedule also improve driveability. These controls are the first of their kind to be applied in the world. 830881. (P- 1 39) A study of the torsional vibration of auto- motive power trains.

(P-139) Properties of formable high strength sheet steels for automotive use. Susumu Satoh, Akio Tosaka, Toshiyuki Kato, Masatoshi Shino- zaki, Takashi Obara, and Minoru Nishida, Kawa- saki Steel Corporation, Japan. Metallurgical factors affecting the press formability of the newly developed high strength sheet steels have been dis- cussed. Dual phase steels, CHLY (cold-rolled sheet steel) and HTP-D (as-hot-rolled sheet steel), produced by control of cooling conditions after intercritical annealing or hot- rolling exhibit very low yield to tensile strength ratio and high n-value. Rephosphorized extra-low carbon steel, CHRX, produced by continuous annealing with rapid cool- ing is characterized by its extremely high r-value and low yield strength. CHLY, HTP-D and CHRX have large bake hardenability. Precipitation hardened steel, HTP-F (hot- rolled sheet steel), produced by adjusting carbon equivalent and sulfur content is suitable for manufacturing wheel rims owing to its good formability after flash butt welding. 830884.

The influence of retained austenite on work hardening be- havior of dual-phase steel has been investigated in an inter- critically annealed dual-phase steel. The retained austenite was classified morphologically into either isolated or cap- sulated type. The capsulated type was found to be much more stable mechanically than the isolated type since the former could be effectively protected from strain by hard martensite shell. The isolated type was easily deformed by the first several percent plastic strain. The increase in work hardening rate, caused by the strain induced transformation of retained austenite to martensite, was ascribed to the con- tribution of the isolated type, the major volume fraction of retained austenite. 830885.

(P-139) The commercial vehicles in Korea. Cho Rae-Seung and Shin Dong- Young, KIA Indus- trial Co., Ltd., Korea. Considering the government's policy in the automobile in- dustry and economic circumstances, we investigated the history, the status of commercial vehicles and the outlook for the Korean automobile industry which is gradually re- covering from the inactivity which has prevailed since the second oil shock. Passenger car production was greater than that of commercial vehicles in 1982, but more commercial vehicles than passenger cars were registered in 1982. 830891. (P-139) Development of aerodynamic computa- tion routine for road vehicles using panel method. Harijono Djojodihardjo, Institute of Technology Bandung &amp; National Institute of Aeronautics and Space, Indonesia. A numerical method for the calculation of pressure distri- bution on automobile bodies is developed, utilizing panel approach already established in the literature. In the pre- sent phase, by resort to Green's identity, the road vehicle body is represented by doublet singularities. Attention is given to the modeling of the wake shed off the aft part of the body. The plausibility of the method is investigated by application to simple geometries. Preliminary results indi- cate that the method can predict the velocity potential with reasonable accuracy, but further refinement is required to predict surface pressure distribution accurately. 830892. (P-139) Fuel economy technologies for commer- cial vehicles. Teruo Ikeda and Kin-ya Okita, Hino Motors, Ltd., Japan. Since the oil crises, improvement of fuel economy of com- mercial vehicles has become a vital problem common to fleet owners and vehicle manufacturers. Improvement of fuel economy can be accomplished by combining a fuel-efficient engine and a low running resist- ance vehicle through engine and transmission matching so that the engine can operate in the most favourable area of its fuel consumption map. To have gearratios suitable for various operating con- ditions leads to a multi-speed gearbox in theory. And the results of our experiments show that multi-speed gearbox can offer better fuel economy than 6-speed gearbox widely used today, but the frequent gearshifting it accompanys would prevent it from being widely accepted in Japan. 830893. (P-139) Research on vibration of motor vehicle front wheels. Guan Di-Hua, Associate Professor, Tsing-Hua University, China. The common feature of forced and self-excited vibrations encountered in motor vehicle front wheels lies in the fact that a certain amount of energy is fed back via tire-road interaction from the engine to front axle steering system, which may result in the presence of negative damping as in self-excited vibration. This paper presents two mathematical models for vi- bration analysis namely, an eighth order mathematical model of the front-axle steering system and a composite mathematical model comprising both front-axle steering system and the whole suspended structure with its own modal parameters. The theory and method presented in this paper are in accord with actual tests on certain vehicles. 830894. (P-139) Development history of the doubles com- binations in Japan. Y. Itoh and A.

(P-139) Engine thermal efficiency versus fuel availability. Amarianto Kusumowardhoyo and Wiranto Arismunandar, Institute of Technology Bandung, Indonesia. The higher thermal efficiency of diesel engine over gasoline engine has been known. Recent developments show that more and more compact diesel engines come into the mar- ket. Therefore, diesel engines will not only be used for trucks and buses, but also for jeeps and passenger cars. However, concerning the increasing demand of diesel en- gines in the automotive field, the fuel availability must be considered as one of the very important parameters for engine selection. In the paper the basic consideration will be put forward and the methodology will be developed so that alternative solutions can be shown. 135</page><page sequence="117">830896 - 830903 830896.

Operational analysis of bus duty and economic analysis indicate large savings by dual fuel operation. The pilot bus conversion is described. 830897. (P-139) An experimental study on combustion of gasoline-hydrogen mixed fuel. Li Jing-ding, Lu Ying-ging, and Du Tian-shen, Zhejiang Univer- sity, China. The gasoline-air mixture added with a certain amount of hydrogen used as an engine fuel can extend the ignition limits, increase the rate of flame propagation and accelerate the combustion rate of the lean mixture; so that the fuel economy and emission characteristics of the engine are both improved herewith. The testing results of a single cylinder engine and a four cylinder automotive engine using such kind of dual fuel to improve their thermal efficiencies and fuel economy as well as to decrease their exhaust emissions are described in this paper. 830898. (P-139) Performance of a spark ignition engine fueled with methanol or methanol-gasoline blends. Byung Chui Yoo, Korea University, Ko- rea. Engine torque and specific energy consumption of an auto- motive engine were studied under steady state condition using gasoline, methanol gasoline blends and straight meth- anol as fuel. At first the engine was run without any modifi- cation. Next the diameters of metering orifices in carbure- tor were modified to give the same excess air factor regardless of fuel type under each fixed engine operating condition. Finally the engine was run with 15% mixture methanol in gasoline by volume using the carburetor modi- fied to have approximately 10% larger fuel flow area than the production carburetor. From the results of this study the effects of using methanol on engine torque and specific energy consumption can be explained on the basis of change in stoichiometry caused by the use of methanol. 830899. (P-139) Vehicle operating experience with metha- nol as a substitute for petrol and diesel. Richard J. Joyce, David F. S. Natusch, and David W. Richardson, Liquid Fuels Trust Board, Welling- ton, New Zealand. Blends of 15% methanol with petrol containing 1% iso- butanol have been utilised by 45 vehicles operated for a period of two years. An additional 907 vehicles have been operated for approximately one year to obtain information about the distribution of M15 blends, about necessary co- solvent concentrations, and about general vehicle driveabil- ity. Initial studies have also been conducted using 15-20% emulsions of methanol with diesel in diesel-cycle engines. High methanol fuels ranging from M85 to M 100 have been tested in six purpose-built vehicles and 45 retrofitted ve- hicles involving four different types of retrofit systems. In addition, high methanol fuels have also been tested in diesel-cycle engines involving two different types of purpose-built engines, together with unmodified engines. 830900. (P-139) Further development of the methanol- fueled Escort. Roberta J. Nichols, Ford Motor Company, USA. The results obtained from the 40-vehicle fleet of methanol- fueled Escorts in service since 1981 are reviewed. These results provided the basis for an upgraded vehicle built on the production line. A total of 587 vehicles were built, in- cluding five advanced technology vehicles with more strin- gent emissions goals at equivalent thermal efficiency. Vehi- cle configuration, fuel and oil specifications, and emission, fuel economy and performance data are discussed. One of the major challenges when developing the vehicle was the selection of fuel system materials compatible with metha- nol. A follow-on program to find cost reduction solutions is underway. 830901. (P-139) Camira-General Motors J-Car in Austra- lia. Adrian C. J.

Hiroshige Fukuhara, Masaki Kubota, and Atsumi Hashimoto, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., Ja- pan. This paper describes a diversity receiving system for car radios which effectively reduces distortion caused by multi- path propagation. The system consists of two antennas con- nected to FM receiving units, distortion sensing logic cir- cuits, a stereo multiplexer, and a stereo amplifier. The input of the stereo multiplexer is switched between the two FM receiving units upon command from the distortion sensing logic circuits. One advantage of this system is that the dis- tortion sensor allows the output level to correspond to audi- tory perception, thus assuring accurate selection between the two antennas. The effectiveness of diversity selection in reducing multipath distortion has been confirmed in a sim- ulation experiment which was performed using distortion sensor output data that were recorded in a field trial. An instantaneous high-cut control function for the audio signal is also incorporated into the system to elimi- nate any distortion that remains after diversity selection is performed. 830908. (P-139) Program discriminating electronic tuning car radio. Hiroshi Nöda, Kenichi Taura, and Daiji Taketomi, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Japan. A successful development was achieved of a car radio with an electronic tuning system which is provided with such an entirely novel function as continuous automatic selection of the broadcasting station with the highest receiving level among identical programs by directly comparing the re- ceiving sound signals of the broadcasting station with those of other stations. It is particularly epoch-making that this development was realized with a 1 -tuner system, since it was thought very difficult to achieve such a development with a 1 -tuner system. The practical value of this development could be also confirmed. 830909. (P-139) Considerations for vehicular integration of mobile radio telephone equipment. I.

Cutler, Schwitzer, A Household International Company, U.S.A. Licensing technology has long been established a viable means for helping both parties of such an agreement im- prove their technology bases. The licensor/licensee relation- ship must be close and interactive to optimize these im- provements. The importance of the selection process of potential licensees as well as the structuring of how the technology is transferred are key items for the success of license agreements. Future licensing activities may require tighter controls on technology transfers to protect against the creation of new competitors. 830916.

The designers of the automotive gear box always struggle to reduce its size and weight. So an exact computation of bending stress of gear teeth turns out to be an important problem. In this paper the proper selection of boundary restriction of calculated scheme of gear tooth has been dis- cussed. With using the finite element method, the influence of structural parameters of gear on its bending stress has been evaluated. The accuracy of the calculated results has been proved by experiments. 830920. (P-139) Diving accident of passenger car into wa- ter. Richard I. Emori and Junji Horiguchi, Seikei University, Japan. To study diving accidents of passenger cars into water, staged experiments with full-scale vehicles driven by a pro- fessional stunt-man and a corresponding 1/10 scale model were performed. The motion of the vehicle recorded by high-speed movie cameras and the time history of decelera- tion of the vehicle at the impact confirmed the model rules. The paper shows that diving accidents of automobile into the water can be studied with scale models and makes few suggestions how to escape for survival. 830921.

Some methods to reduce aerodynamic drag and lift are described including rear body shapes and effects of engine cooling air. A prediction method of ventilation character- istics is also explained. Air flow rate through a compart- ment is estimated using static pressure distribution on a model body surface. At high speed, front windshield wipers float from a glass surface by wind pressure. The causes and countermeasures of the wiper floating are discussed. 830923. (P-139) One approach on the axle gear noise gen- erated from the torsional vibration. Akira Na- kayashiki, Kazuo Kubo, and Hideki Imanishi, Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd., Japan. Many papers have discussed that the axle gear noise is largely affected by the torsional vibration of the driveline. In the authors' view, however, the theoretical results do not necessarily coincide with the experimental ones. Namely, while theoretical analysis shows no difference in the peak frequency between the acceleration noise and the overrun noise, experiments do show some difference. The authors considered that these phenomena are de- pendent on the stiffness of the bearings of the pinion and ring gear. Simulating an idealized model which represents the torsional vibration of the driveline, study was made on the analogy of the theoretical results to the experimental ones. 830924. (P-139) Noise analysis for gear box defect detec- tion. Komang Bagiasna, Hadi Suganda, and Djoko Suharto. Several transmission gear boxes of small size transportation vehicle have been investigated using noise analysis based on Campbell as well as Order-ratio diagram. The emitted noise signal is analyzed digitally using Spectrum analyzer and computerized data processing is performed to identify noise sources of the rotating elements. For this particular gear box, the results show the noise sources are mainly from the rotating shafts. 830925. (P-139) Noise and vibration reduction measures applied to diesel engine cars.

(P-139) Application of a mass airflow sensor to the automotive environment. Richard J. Bremer, AC Spark Plug Div., General Motors Corp., U.S.A. Mass Airflow Sensors (MAS) are being applied in increas- ing number to fuel injected engines. The primary reason for this is desensitization of intake air measurements to engine variation along with improved accuracy with altitude and temperature changes. When applying a MAS to a fuel injec- tion system, a number of considerations must be addressed to insure a quality measurement is obtained. This paper will discuss the operation of the GM hot film mass airflow sensor and overview its application to fuel injected engines. 830931. (P-139) Microprocessors for automotive applica- tions.

(P-139) A study on octane requirement for motor vehicles in Indonesia. F. Batti and W. Kaslan, Oil and Gas Technology Development Centre, Indo- nesia. The knowledge of the exact level of octane number required for the car population in a country is quite important both for the petroleum refiners and the consumers. If the actual gasoline octane number is too high, the use of a superfluous 140</page><page sequence="122">830933 - 830938 anti-knock represents a loss for the refiners; on the contrary, if the octane level is too low, knock will result and risks of engine damage may occur. Various factors affecting the oc- tane requirement of the car such as engine design, atmo- spheric conditions, service life of the car are reviewed. The octane level needed could only be assessed by ac- tual measurements on cars representing the various types of cars in the country. Two consecutive studies for the requirement of the car population in Indonesia were carried out in 1978 and 1982 respectively, are described, and the results of the measure- ments of both studies are expressed in octane requirement curves. 830934.

(P-139) Future trends in automotive fuels and engine oils. Leo J. McCabe, Fredric B. Fitch, and H. Vaughn Lowther, Mobil Res. &amp; Dev. Corp., USA. Spark-ignited gasoline engines are being designed with higher compression ratios using high-swirl, fast-burn com- bustion chambers and extensive use of electronic controls. These factors, together with the trend to lower lead levels and increasing use of unleaded gasoline, will affect anti- knock requirements. Gasoline volatility will be optimized to provide satisfactory performance with available refinery components. The effects of these factors on future gasoline quality requirements are reviewed. The potential for oxy- genates as transportation fuels is also assessed. Continued emphasis on fuel economy will result in increased dieselization. This, together with the trend to- ward heavier crude oils and more catalytic cracking, will result in diesel fuels with lower cetane number, higher final boiling point, and increased density and viscosity. Test data indicate that the effects of these changes on engine perform- ance should be minimal. Expected changes in worldwide industry engine oil specifications are described, along with a description of specific engine builder tests designed to evaluate a particu- lar performance feature. The effect of types of base stocks which are applicable to future oils are reviewed. These in- clude solvent-refined, hydroprocessed and synthetic stocks. The role played by various types of chemical-addition agents are also included in this discussion. The expected changes in future engines and their effect on future engine oils are covered. Finally, the most important engine oil performance parameters required for the future are re- viewed. 830936. (P-139) Reconciliation of engine oil performance characteristics around the world. P. A. Asseff, The Lubrizol Corporation, U.S.A.; D. C. Brown, The Lubrizol Corporation, England; Y. Masuda, The Lubrizol Corporation, Japan; and D. M. Sm- ish, The Lubrizol Corporation, U.S.A. Currently there are several different governing bodies which promulgate lubricant performance requirements for their respective engines and geographical areas. While these diverse specifications are effective in the development of satisfactory lubricants, the different test procedures overlap with respect to the measurement of a fundamental property of the lubricant. The net effect is a multitude of engine tests required for the development of lubricants to satisfy the various engine requirements throughout the world. The authors review this lubricant development process and offer suggestions to stimulate current efforts to reconcile these various engine test requirements. 830937. (P-139) Gasoline volatility and hot weather drive- ability of Japanese cars. Eiichi Yoshida, Hi- rotsugu Nomura, Nobuyoshi Nozaki, and Takao Nagasawa, Nippon Oil Company, Ltd., Japan. Hot weather driveability test procedures on a chassis dyna- mometer correlated with field tests were established, and the effect of gasoline volatility on driveability performance was examined using 1 1 Japanese cars. It was found that the 50% evaporated temperature had a larger effect on hot weather driveability than the Reid vapor pressure. Also, hot idle compensators and fuel return systems were very effective for reducing malfunctions. As to conditions which should be controlled in chassis dynamometer tests, wind velocity were important as the same as ambient temperature; however, sun loading was not. 830938. (P-139) A new concept in engine deposit control additives for unleaded gasolines. Robert A. Le- wis, Henry K. Newhall, Richard J. Peyla, Doug- las A. Voss, and J. Stephen Welstand, Chevron Research Company, U.S.A. Polymeric gasoline deposit control (DC) additives have in- creased in acceptance during the 1970's. Their effectiveness in controlling gasoline engine carburetor and induction system deposits has been clearly demonstrated. However, with increasing use of unleaded gasolines, two side effects - increased combustion chamber deposits which can lead to increased octane requirements and increased oil viscosity due to migration of the additive package into the crankcase - have been noted. 141</page><page sequence="123">830938 - 830945 A new generation of DC additive technology based on a unique polyether structure was developed to minimize the noted side effects while maintaining deposit control per- formance. Extensive field tests of the new additive have demonstrated excellent deposit control with attendant main- tenance of fuel metering and exhaust emissions perform- ance. Vehicles using the new additive have octane require- ments measurably lower than vehicles using the earlier additives. 830939. (P-139) Comparison of urban driving patterns. Eric Milkins and Harry Watson, University of Melbourne, Australia. Measured driving pattern data for 4 Australian cities are compared with driving cycles from U.S.A., Europe and Japan, and with cycles developed to represent driving in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. If cycle emissions rates and fuel consumption are intended to typify those of Australian urban driving a new drive cycle is needed since the legis- lated cycles do not closely replicate observed driving pat- terns or vehicle emissions and fuel consumption. 830940. (P-139) Analysis and estimation of fuel consump- tion in urban traffic. Junkoh Shima and Tomoji Hirose, Toyota Motor Corporation; and Riichi Takahachi and Hiroyoshi Tsuji, Toyota Central Res. &amp; Dev. Labs., Inc., Japan. From the multivariate analysis on the actual data collected in urban driving, it was shown that average trip time was the single most important factor in explaining the variabil- ity of fuel consumption. The theoretical approximation model was derived in terms of physical properties of engine- vehicle systems and the relationships among the traffic re- lated parameters and ten factors including the trip time were identified. Paying attention to the average trip time, the fuel consumption estimation model was verified using the traffic detector data to be in comparatively good agree- ment with the actual fuel consumption. 830941. (P-139) Energy conservation effects on road safe- ty. A. J. McLean, NH&amp;MRC Road Accident Re- search Unit, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia. Some of the ways in which energy conservation measures are affecting the safety of road transportation are reviewed in this paper. The areas considered include traffic legisla- tion and control, type of vehicle, size of car and type of fuel. It is concluded that many of the simple measures that have been adopted to conserve fuel have had a detrimental effect on safety. 830942.

The unique minicar in Japan is subject to various legal restrictions regarding body size, engine volume and seating capacity, and loading, while it is given privilege with regard to tax and insurance. And today it is not merely an even smaller version of small-size vehicles vehicles. It is indepen- dently viewed as an economical vehicle for which technical efforts have been undertaken to ensure functional and per- formance equality to small-size vehicles. And these efforts are successfully in progress resulting in the feature of small- ness remaining intact. In other words, the Japanese minicar is in the process of improving high-speed capabilities with general equality being maintained to that of small-size ve- hicles regarding interior space and urban travel. 830943.

During the fourth five year plan, most of leading enterprises in Korea have made large scale investment in heavy and chemical industries. But global economic recession made the future of heavy and chemical industries of Korea very gloomy. Consequently Korean Government issued the In- dustry reformation policy to rationalize the structure and to enhance international competitive strengths of Korean in- dustries by the adjustment of business sector and invest- ment scope among specific enterprises. This policy will be enforced for reasonable length of time. 830945. (P-139) Several problems regarding the develop- ment of Chinese automotive industries.

(P-139) Government regulation of vehicles in Australia for safety, emissions and fuel economy. Raymond H. Bartlett, Royal Automobile Club of Victoria, Australia. Road transport in Australia is regulated by separate Gov- ernments in six States and two Territories resulting in dif- fering standards of regulation. A co-operative effort by Fed- eral and State Governments to achieve uniform regulation of vehicle safety and emissions has improved the situation. This paper reviews the development of the regulatory sys- tem and possible changes to both the system and regula- tions. 830947. (P-139) Long range program plan for safety and fuel economy. Barry Felrice, Natl Hwy Traffic Safety Admin, Dept of Transportation, United States of America. An analysis was made to determine which potential high- way and motor vehicle safety activities were most deserving of further pursuit so as to obtain the greatest improvement in safety at the least cost. Criteria were established to guide in the rating and ranking of potential safety projects. The most significant national safety problems were identified and a description and schedule of the chosen safety projects to address those problems were prepared. 830948. (P-139) Long range program plan for safety and policy towards international harmonization of safety standards.

Japanese safety standards are specified by the Safety Regu- lations and relevant Circular Notices. MOT had revised the standards according to the first program plan for safety of 1972. Future revisions will be made according to the second program plan issued in 1980. The main emphasis will be laid down on measures for high speed driving, measures to prevent fire and safety measures for trucks. MOT will also seek the way to harmonize its standards with the UN ECE Regulations through positive participation to WP 29 of ECE. Efforts for world-wide harmonization will be made by MOT. 830949. (P-139) Problems of construction equipment maintenance in Indonesia. Purwoko Hadi and Nakoela Soenarta, Ministry of Public Works, In- donesia. In developing countries equipment are frequently idle or even permanently damaged from lack of adequate mainte- nance and repair facilities. Low utilization of capacity may be due to various fac- tors, but reasons frequently given are shortage of skilled personnel, parts, and tools. The problems of maintenance and repair increase with the number of types of equipment used. In developing coun- tries we find many types of equipment made by different countries. Parts and special tools will be difficult to obtain. To provide maximum operating time at minimum maintenance cost some practical methods have been ap- plied: 1. Giving incentive to the group of personnel which successfully operate at a definite time with minimum down- time. 2. Using reserve units as sources of parts. It was found that these methods are economically fair. 830950. (P-139) Strategic route in highway transportation in Java. Giri S. Hadihardjono and Djauhari P., Directorate General of Land Transport and In- land Waterways, Indonesia. Increase in economic activities in Indonesia creates high mobility of people as well as goods. The then existing infra- structure could not cope with the increasing traffic, which is also accompanied by inefficiency. In order to optimize and to increase efficiency of transportation, especially of freight, a concept of strategic route for highway transportation has been established. In this paper only the strategic route in Java will be presented and discussed. 830951. (P-139) Drivers' comprehension of traffic sign information. Wendy Macdonald and Errol Hoff- mann, University of Melbourne, Australia. Some alternative methods of coding information on traffic signs, including the major "international" systems, are dis- cussed and evaluated in the light of recent Australian re- search on drivers' understanding of various forms of regula- tory traffic signs. Particular attention is paid to the relative advantages and disadvantages of prohibitory and mandatory forms of information. For some regulatory sign messages it appears that none of the existing purely sym- bolic signs achieves a satisfactory level of driver compre- hension, and in such cases "hybrid" signs, combining sym- bolic and verbal information, are recommended. 830952. (P-139) Traffic noise measurements in the city of Bandung, Indonesia. Soegijanto, Bandung Insti- tute of Technology, Indonesia. Traffic noise measurements have been done at several loca- tions representing urban area, center and periphery of the city. The traffic consists of cars, motor cycles, trucks and buses. The percentage of motor cycles is relatively high (30-50%). The flow of vehicles is not uniform with a 24 hour average of more than 1000 vehicles per hour. The noise levels to be measured were Li0, L50 and L90. The noise indices to be calculated were Traffic Noise Index (TNI), Equivalent Energy Level (Leq) and Noise Pollution Level (Lnp). Evaluation of the noise indices based on the corre- sponding limit values show that at most of the streets the values have been exceeded. Predictions of Li0 (18 hr) com- pared with the measured values were also discussed. 143</page><page sequence="125">830953 - 830979 830953.

(P-139) The effect of blending alcohol in gasoline on physical and chemical properties. Bustani Mustafa, Oil and Gas Technology Development Centre "Lemigas"; and Amarianto Kusumo- wardhoyo and Wiranto Arismunancar, Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia. There are two basic incentives to blend alcohol in gasoline i.e. 1. as a fuel extender to reduce the amount of gasoline used. 2. to improve the octane quality of gasoline. This paper is concerned with the study on the blending effect of ethanol in premium gasoline produced in Indone- sia, especially on its physical and chemical properties, and the improvement of its octane number. The blendings were made in four concentrations (e.g. 5, 10, 15 and 20% volume ethanol in premium gasoline). The test results will be compared to the Indonesian specification of premium gasoline. 830957. (P-139) Static analysis of a typical truck frame.

This paper describes the static analysis of a 2% ton payload truck chassis frame. Using a displacement method a beam model has been used. The matrix analysis results are compared to laboratory frame bending and torsion measurements. The results showed that the beam model can be used as a simple and satisfactory technique to analyse a truck frame. 830976. Improvement of crashworthiness using plastic scale models. Hajime Yamashita, Hidetoshi Shin- tani, and Kazuyuki Okada, Toy o Kogyo Co., Ltd., Japan. This paper describes the applicability of plastic scale model- ing to evaluate the crash performance of the vehicle struc- ture, which is considered an effective tool in the initial stage of vehicle development. In selecting a suitable plastic material, importance was placed on the relative insensitivity to breakage under load, as well as the similarity of the stress versus strain character- istics to that of steel. A corrective formula was derived to convert the plastic material results to that of steel material. This formula is based on the examination of the substantial effect of mate- rial thickness, in addition to general scale analogy. Further, the plastic scale model load versus displace- ment characteristics, corrected using the corrective for- mula, were inputted in a simple mathematical simulation model. The use of this technique can predict crash response with adequate accuracy. 830977. An analysis of the vehicle-occupant impact dy- namics and its application. Matthew Huang, Ford Motor Co., Automotive Safety Office. The vehicle-occupant impact dynamics during a crash are studied using a simple mathematical model. The model yields explicit analytical relationships between occupant re- sponses and physical parameters of the vehicle structure and occupant restraint system. These parametric relation- ships, verified by experimental crash tests of the total sys- tem, are useful in describing the physical concepts of the impact event, and predicting occupant dynamic behavior during a vehicle crash. The limitations of the model are discussed and the design procedures using the equations and "carpet" plots are presented to aid the designer in the selection of a restraint system and vehicle structural param- eters to meet predetermined design criteria. The application of the "carpet" plot in studying the sensitivity of the occu- pant response to the vehicle structural parameters is also demonstrated. 830978. Diesel engine noise reduction by the use of a reinforced nylon rocker cover. Mario Tesio and Giovanni Turino, Fiat Centro Ricerche, Torino, Italy; and John L. Chruma, Monsanto Polymer Products Co., St. Louis, MO. In recent years, the development of sophisticated engineer- ing resins for the automotive industry has expanded the applications into areas generally reserved for metals. Weight and cost reduction have been driving forces for most conversions, with noise reduction only a distant possi- bility. This study describes work in which a thermoplastic nylon 66 rocker cover was designed to reduce the overall noise emitting from a diesel passenger car engine. A 10% reduction of engine acoustic power output was achieved. 1 983 SAE Transactions 830979. Down-gauging outer body panels through the use of rib-shaped plastic reinforcement. Yukio Naga- ta, Toshikatsu Miura, and Yukio Okada, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. 144</page><page sequence="126">830979 - 830984 Down-gauging outer panels is an effective method for reduc- ing the weight of an automobile body. We have succeeded in narrowing the thickness of outer panels by using rib-shaped plastic reinforcement. The plastic reinforcement consists of unhardened resin and an adhesive sheet, and it conforms well to the curved panel surface. In the body paint oven, it is hardened on the outer panels and forms a rib-shaped structure. This paper describes the composition of the resin mate- rial, the manufacturing process and the strength and rigidity of outer panels made with the rib-shaped reinforcement. It also discusses the weight reduction effect achieved by ap- plying these panels to the doors of a production vehicle. 1983 SAE Transactions 830980. The development of the suspension system used on the Nissan Stanza - a new front-wheel-drive compact car. Hiroyasu Kan, Takayoshi Kawaura, and Masataka Iki, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. The suspension system of the Nissan Stanza was specifically designed for use on a front-wheel-drive car. It was devel- oped with the idea that the new suspension should be com- pact and light, and afford a comfortable ride as well as good stability and controllability. Furthermore, it should have excellent noise and vibration characteristics. To achieve these objectives we adapted a strut suspen- sion for both the front and rear, and careful consideration was given to the fundamental specifications. In addition, some new ideas were applied for the layout of the suspen- sion. 830981. Ride and handling of a European car: the Renault 9. P. M. Beuzit, Régie Nationale des Usines Re- nault (France). We discuss the problems of comfort and handling of Euro- pean vehicles using a typical example: the RENAULT 9. Many problems related to weight, size, unibody construc- tion and, four cylinders engines... are given. Some details about the means used to solve them are given and solutions for a RENAULT 9 are analysed. Of course the vehicle represents a compromise adapted to European market vehi- cle which is rather different from the U.S. Market, a factor considered in the design of the RENAULT- AMC Alliance. 830982. Volvo 760 GLE rear axle suspension. Ante Larsson and Sigvard Zetterström, Chassis Engrg., Volvo Car Corp.; and Carl-Ingvar Bergström, Sound &amp; Vibration, Testing Complete Car, Volvo Car Corp. The main objective of the design has been to combine the suspension elements of a live axle in such a way that low frequency (50 - 200 Hz) engine torque fluctuations will be adequately insulated from the body and in this way dimin- ish any tendency to body boom even when driving at low speed with a 4 cylinder car. The goal should be met without infringing upon other desirable characteristics of the rear axle suspension. The importance of wind-up compliance, and properly positioned attachment points on the rear axle housing is stressed. Results from sound and vibration measurement and computation are given. 830983. Future automobile fuel economy: technology and the marketplace. J. A. Alic, L. L. Jenney, and T. E. Bull, Office of Technology Assessment, U.S. Congress. Technology is not now a primary limiting factor in the fuel economy achieved by the U.S. new-car fleet, nor is it likely to be in the near future. Technology is a limiting factor to the extent that it determines the fuel economy that can be achieved in cars of a given size. While means are generally available to achieve signifi- cant improvements in the fuel economy of cars of all sizes - by making them lighter in weight for given interior di- mensions, refining powertrains, and making other design improvements - costs can be rather high, and benefits in the marketplace uncertain. Sophisticated design approaches are needed not for fuel economy alone but also to continue providing amenities such as ample interior space and carry- ing capacity, luxurious and quiet surroundings (which una- voidably add weight), higher performance levels, air condi- tioning and power accessories - while also improving gas mileage. Based on such considerations, the Office of Technol- ogy Assessment has projected average new-car fuel econo- mies through the end of the century according to two sce- narios. The low scenario, relatively conservative technically but assuming continuing market demand for better fuel economy, results in the following estimates for the average gas mileage of new cars sold in the United States, based on EPA 55 percent city/45 percent highway ratings. 1990 38 mpg 1995 43 mpg 2000 5 1 mpg. The high scenario, with a major shift toward smaller cars, points to an average new car gas mileage rating greater than 70 mpg by 2000. OTA's projections show that continued improvement in automobile fuel economy beyond a 30 mpg baseline new- car average in 1985 could save 0.6 to 1.3 million barrels of oil per day by 2000, depending on the size mix of future new car sales and the technologies these vehicles embody. 830984.

The vehicles were driven by non-expert drivers in California and Michigan for commut- ing and personal use and maintained in a manner similar to in-use vehicles. The average fleet emissions of hydrocarbons (HC) remained below the 1975 California emission stan- dards appropriate for these vehicles for 80,000 miles (129,000 km), the average carbon monoxide (CO) emissions remained below the standard for 70,000 miles (1 13,000 km), and emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) never exceeded the appropriate standards. 1983 SAE Transactions 830985. Engine dynamometer study of the transient re- sponse of Zr02 and Ti02 exhaust gas oxygen sensors. J. A. Cook, D. R. Hamburg, W. J. Kai- ser, and E. M. Logothetis, Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. The transient response of Zr02 and Ti02 EGO sensors has been investigated under actual engine operating conditions. The results of this study show that the response of an EGO sensor is dependent upon the characteristics of the engine and feedback control system with which it is used. Specifi- cally, sensor response time is a function of the magnitude and frequency of the A/F changes and the initial and final values of A/F to which the sensor is exposed. Zr02 and Ti02 sensors show similar transient behavior and have practically equivalent response times. 1983 SAE Transactions 830986. An engine-dynamometer study of the A/F com- patibility between a three-way catalyst and an exhaust gas oxygen sensor. D. R. Hamburg, J. A. Cook, W. J. Kaiser, and E. M. Logothetis, Re- search Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. An engine-dynamometer study was performed to quantify the air-fuel ratio (A/F) offset between the window of a three-way catalyst (TWC) and the closed-loop control point of an exhaust gas oxygen (EGO) sensor. In this study, the effects of rpm, torque, EGR, and A/F modulation were explored along with the age of the TWC and EGO sensor. In general, it was determined that the closed-loop EGO sensor control point shifts lean as a function of increasing feedgas NOx concentration, thus causing the engine A/F to move away from the high NOx conversion efficiency regime of the TWC. 1983 SAE Transactions 830987. A study of the potential impact of some unregu- lated motor vehicle emissions. Craig A. Harvey, Robert J. Garbe, Thomas M. Baines, Joseph H. Somers, Karl H. Hellman, and Penny M. Carey, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Studies of emissions from vehicles equipped with catalysts have shown that some unregulated emissions can increase when a catalyst is used. One example of this is sulfuric acid, which has been studied extensively. Other unregulated emissions include ammonia and hydrogen cyanide. In a number of studies, these unregulated pollutant emissions have been measured from light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines. These emission levels were used in air quality dispersion models to predict the resultant air quality levels. The ambient concentrations predicted for each pol- lutant were then compared to suggested concentrations at which adverse health effects may be found to determine if additional monitoring or control would be indicated for these pollutants. It was determined that mobile source emissions of sulfuric acid, hydrogen cyanide, and ammonia do not in general result in ambient levels of concern for the air quality situations studied. 1983 SAE Transactions 830988. Plastics - challenge facing South African local plastics development. John Summersell, Volk- swagen of South Africa (Pty.) Ltd. Low volume production, coupled with Government local content legislation by vehicle weight has inhibited the growth of a sound plastics converting industry. However with the increasing use of plastics materials by parent com- panies in Europe and America, and the need to meet local conditions both engineer and converter has been stimulated into taking a more positive approach to the challenge of developing alternative materials and processes which from a cost and investment requirement will be suitable for short production runs, and still meet the quality and safety stan- dards. Developments in the past have included most interior trim applications. Currently however there are growing ac- tivities into the areas of plastic fuel tanks, bumpers, spoil- ers, and outer body parts. The challenge which faces the manufacturer is to de- velop a reliable self sufficient plastics industry which is cost competitive to that of the imported products. 830989. Ford Australia gathers experience in the develop- ment, design and manufacture of large PU-Rim components. Klaus C. Glagow, Ford of Australia Limited. Ford of Australia commenced producing polyurethane bumper systems on their large passenger car range in 1979.

Realization via dynamic testing with glass-fibre reinforced plastics - interpretations for bumper systems. Klaus-Dieter Johnke, Herbert Fehrecke, and D. G. McLeod, Passenger Car Development, 146</page><page sequence="128">830984-830990 Volkswagenwerk AG - Wolfsburg (Federal Re- public of Germany). Today the new situation in the areas of energy and raw materials is exercising a tangible influence on the use of plastics in European automotive engineering. New attitudes towards the situation as regards raw materials and energy emphasize the importance of plastics as future-oriented ma- terials. Plastomers, duromers and elastomers are being shown to be usable not only for the bodywork but also for exterior components of the car which are subjected to high mechanical stress. The extent to which lightweight con- struction can realistically be applied to the area of bumper systems using composite materials and the question as to whether or not these high polymers can make it possible to save enough energy to meet with economy requirements will be discussed here. In addition, the findings arising from the determination of deformation-related degrees of damage to glass-fibre reinforced plastics and the possible influence on the design of new bumper systems will be shown. There are examples to show how effectively glass-fibre reinforced and glass-fibre mineral reinforced high polymers, both compact and foamed, can be used. 1983 SAE Transactions 830991. SMC parts - report on processing and automa- tion for cost reduction. Georg Menges, Institut für Kunststoffverarbeitung, Aachen, West Ger- many; and Heinz Derek, SMC-technologie, Aa- chen, West Germany. This paper deals with a basic flow characterisation for SMC materials. A method is shown to calculate flow of SMC in the mold. Cure and flow control is carried out by pressure transducer measurement to optimise flow and to minimise curing time. Consequenses for part production are dis- cussed. A lay out for process control is developed. Several devices of an automised production line are shown. A final economy consideration gives a rapid amortisation period and a good pre-tax profitability. 1983 SAE Transactions 830992. Polypropylene and polyamide developments in the European automotive industry. E. Döring, Deutsche ICI GmbH, Frankfurt. The priorities for the development of cars were never so quickly changed than in the last 10 years. Whereas safety was the main target in the 1970's, it is now energy saving. Therefore plastics consumption has increased tremen- dously. Main contenders are POLYPROPYLENE and PO- LYAMIDES. Recently developed items in POLYPRO- PYLENE for the bumper systems, for seats, for faseias and interior trim applications are discussed. POLYAMIDE developments are mainly based on under bonnet applica- tions like header tanks and airfilter parts, but also get wider acceptance for exterior parts. 830993. The development and future of plastic applica- tions in the European car industry. Klaus R. von Hörde, General Electric Plastics Europe. The role of plastics in the European car industry has changed considerably. Historically the material was used as a substitute which did little to influence the total car design nor the production process. New development and market pressures indicate that creative plastic applications on ve- hicles are mandatory in order to meet the strategic objec- tives of the automotive industry. Development vehicles and already released advanced design studies give us an indica- tion of how the new challenges are being addressed. Engineering thermoplastics already proven in several de- manding applications will play a major role in state of the art vehicles manufacture in the late eighties. To realise the industry's vision a new dimension in the dialogue between plastic suppliers and car manufacturers has to be imple- mented to ensure mutual profitability. 830994. Manufacturing of large thermoplastics compo- nents for European cars. Derek F. Gentle, Ford Motor Co. Ltd. There are three major areas of large thermoplastics compo- nent development on European cars; instrument panels, bumpers and body side mouldings. Unlike the equivalent parts in the U.S. which are normally painted these parts in Europe are commonly self-coloured with a grained finish. In addition, there are many new thermoplastics com- ponents such as grille panels and spoilers which are painted body colour, must be moulded and finished to tight toler- ances and help to bring total plastics usage on new Euro- pean cars to over 10% of total vehicle weight. The development and manufacture of some of the larger components is discussed, with the large self coloured all plastics front and rear ends and the painted grille panels used on the new European Ford Sierra described in detail. The use of material modification to tailor plastics to the end use has encouraged wider acceptance in the Euro- pean engineering community and the development of new processing and testing techniques has allowed the manufac- ture of previously impossible structures and the attainment of strict European quality standards. 1983 SAE Transactions 830995. Painting of plastic parts for European car bodies. Hendrik de Lange, Leiter Entwicklungslabor fur Kunststofíbeschichtungen, Fahzeugbereich. The European automobile industry is taking an increasing interest in the use of coated plastics for the construction of vehicle-body components. The various types of plastic cur- rently in use are received with particular emphasis on their specific areas of use and on the coating systems required. A detailed example of coating processes for flexible polyure- thane components illustrates the general trends in Europe today. 147</page><page sequence="129">830996-831001 830996. Improvements in rack and pinion steering gears. H. Kurachi, K. Okamoto, I. Saito, and I. Chi- kuma, Automotive Engrg. R&amp;D Center, Nippon Seiko K.K. (NSK). The most effective way to improve the driver's road feel at high speeds is to increase the stiffness between the steering wheel and the vehicle's wheels at times when only a small amount of steering effort is required. Though rack and pinion steering systems have good features in this respect compared with recirculating ball steering systems, which have been commonly used in Japan and the U.S.A., we are studying ways to improve the stiff- ness of rack and pinion steering systems by analyzing the effects of each parameter on stiffness. The effect of the stiffness of rack and pinion steering gears on overall auto- motive steering systems is analyzed here based on actual vehicle tests, which naturally include the stiffness of the vehicle's wheels on the road. 830997. Development of new tilt-wheel steering column with "memory". M. Yamaguchi, . Ikeda, and S. Oka, Automotive Engrg. R&amp;D Center, Nippon Seiko K.K. (NSK). Unlike conventional tilt-wheel devices, the newly developed ones have a "memory mechanism" which allows steering wheels to return to pre-set tilt-angle positions selected by individual drivers using only a single lever. This paper describes the design of such devices and outlines the engineering and test results regarding certain problems, such as the vibration of the systems and influ- ences on the original energy-absorbing characteristics caused by weight addition and increased complexity of the wheel columns. 830998. Power steering 'road feel*. F. J. Adams, Cam Gears Ltd., England (A Division of TRW Inc.). This 'paper' discusses current power steering characteristics and considers why and how the characteristics should change for different driving conditions. It then compares the different ways in which this can be done and considers the advantages and disadvantages of each, including some of the safety aspects. It is mainly, but not exclusively, concerned with motor cars and is basically confined to the modern hydraulic power steering rotary valve which uses torsion bar spring- ing. Most of the illustrations relate to rack and pinion steer- ing but, in a general sense, all that is said can be applied to other types of steering gear. 1983 SAE Transactions 830999. Analysis and design of automobile forebodies us- ing potential flow theory and a boundary layer separation criterion. James C. Paul, Airflow Sciences Corporation; and John G. LaFond, Ford Motor Company. An effective method of designing low drag, attached flow automobile forebodies has been developed. Based on a po- tential flow panel method, a series of computer programs is used to define idealized pressure gradients at several for- ward corner locations including the hood, fender, wind- shield header and A-pillar. Idealized pressure gradients for several radii at each corner location are analyzed using a turbulent boundary layer separation criterion to determine if real-world viscous flow will remain attached. Correlation with wind tunnel test results is included. A non-circular, attached flow hood corner shape is developed based on the separation criterion and an inverse (geometry defining) computer method. 831000. The aerodynamic development of the Probe IV advanced concept vehicle. Robert M. Santer and Mark E. Gleason, Ford Motor Company. The aerodynamic development and characteristics of a four-passenger advanced concept automobile are described. An overview of the areas of the vehicle design which were dealt with to obtain a drag coefficient value of 0.153 is provided. The interior packaging philosophy is outlined which led to the potential for packaging four to six passeng- ers within an extremely low drag automobile. Parametric shape studies of the major surface design elements are doc- umented from the contributing development testing. The particular design treatments adopted and the rationale be- hind the choice of design are examined for each of the aerodynamically-sensitive areas of the vehicle. Examina- tions of the unique solutions to vehicle cooling, ramp and curb clearance, front wheel skirting and vehicle attitude are presented. Full scale wind tunnel data is shown for the configurations examined and vehicle stability parameters compared with conventional vehicles. 1983 SAE Transactions 831001. New design application and material substitution for heavy duty truck body panels. Ernest L. Mo- hawk, Truck &amp; Bus Engineering Operations, Truck &amp; Bus Group, General Motors Corp., Pon- tiac, MI. This paper will discuss the design and development of glass reinforced reaction injection molded parts on the front end of a heavy duty C.O.E. truck which in the past have been traditionally steel or aluminum sheet metal. The subject areas to be discussed are performance cri- teria for material at elevated and sub-zero temperatures, the design criteria established to take full advantage of the se- lected material and meet existing requirements for Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards where applicable. The final outcome of this program was the production release of the following Class "A" exterior glass reinforced urethane reaction injection molded front end panels.

Lawrence D. Peterson and Thomas C. Holka, Ford Motor Company. The application of aerodynamics to the automobile in the last several years has grown considerably. Ford Motor Company, a forerunner in the use of this technology in both their production and concept vehicles, recently unveiled its latest advanced concept vehicle - Probe IV. This paper discusses the various engineering developments which made this vehicle a reality. Specifically, addressed are those engi- neering developments which were necessary to accommo- date the unique styling and aerodynamic functions. 831003. GMC Aero Astro body panels. Willard W. Gregg, GM Truck &amp; Bus. The GMC Aero Astro is a C.O.E. (Cab-Over-Engine) Vehi- cle which incorporates the use of add-on plastic body panels to achieve a more aerodynamically efficient truck-tractor. These panels are made of low pressure-low modulus unrein- forced RIM plastic and FRP (Fiber Reinforced Plastic) using RTM (Resin Transfer Molding) fabricating tech- niques to obtain Class 'A' surfaces. The RTM process is unique since the reinforcement is integrally molded to the outer skins in a one step operation. The RIM (Reaction Injection Molded) panel is designed to collapse into a low profile sidewall when the dragfoiler is dropped into the lowered position. However, this same panel would have to expand and remain rigid enough to minimize cross wind effects in the raised position. This paper describes how these panels were developed for the Aero Astro, and how they would negotiate the multi-mission requirements for fuel efficiency. 831006. Fabricated intake and exhaust manifolds - the steel story. Merle M. Cleeton, Transportation In- dustry Marketing, United States Steel Corp., Troy, MI. This paper describes the merits of manufacturing passenger car intake and exhaust manifolds from steel stampings or fabrications. Information on manufacturing methods, proj- ected costs, as well as prototype work is presented. A re- view of successful current applications and potential future applications of fabricated manifolds concludes the paper. 831007. Mitsubishi Orion-MD - a new variable displace- ment engine. Toyoaki Fukui, Tatsuro Nakagami, Hiroyasu Endo, Takehiko Katsumoto, and Yo- shiaki Danno, Passenger Car Engineering Center, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Kyoto, Japan. A 1.4-liter, 4-cyl. variable-displacement engine was devel- oped as an optional powerplant for a subcompact passenger car. In order to maximize its fuel saving effects, incorpo- rated in the engine are unique valve deactivation devices which are electrically controlled and activated by means of engine oil. Several measures were taken to assure smooth cylinder switching and to cope with the problems caused by reduc- ing the number of operating cylinders from 4 to 2. Thus without deteriorating the driveability, nearly 20% reduction of fuel consumption in the Japanese 10- Mode Cycle was achieved by this engine. 1983 SAE Transactions 831008. The new Nissan 1.7 liter 4 cylinder diesel engine. Satoshi Shiga and Hideo Horiuchi, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. The new Nissan 1.7 liter 4 cylinder diesel engine has been developed to meet the social requirements for energy con- servation. The main objective was to improve fuel economy without sacrificing driveability, and this has been achieved by minimizing engine weight, reducing mechanical friction loss and optimizing the combustion system. The CA series gasoline engine, which is known for its light weight, was chosen as the base engine for dieselization. The swirl cham- ber combustion system used for the LD28 engine was modi- fied to satisfy the requirements for high power, good fuel economy and low noise. Engine noise has been reduced with the aid of several analytical methods such as laser holography. Special attention has been paid to the reduc- tion of diesel knock which is most offensive to the ear. To install this engine in a small FWD vehicle transversely, much effort went into the minimizing of the engine length and width. This paper deals with the design characteristics of the engine components and the development highlights. 1983 SAE Transactions 831009. The new Ford 2.3L High-Swirl-Combustion (HSO engine. H. Lenox and A. J. Scussel, Ford Motor Company. A completely new in-line four cylinder engine has been designed at Ford Motor Company for use in the 1984 Tem- po/Topaz front- wheel-drive vehicle line. This paper will describe several factors which influenced the engine design, specifically in the areas of improved combustion, reduced friction, electronic controls, packaging and manufacturing. Individual component and overall system designs will also be described. 831010. Improvement of rotary engine performance by new induction system. Haruo Okimoto, Hiroshi Ohzeki, and Masayuki Kawachi, Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd. (Hiroshima, Japan). Recent market trends show growing demands for automo- bile engines to attain better fuel economy and higher output while meeting the emission standards. 149</page><page sequence="131">831010-831016 To cope with these demands, Toy o Kogyo has made numerous improvements year by year on the rotary engine. A new engine that guarantees well-balanced fuel econ- omy and vehicle performance has been developed. This engine uses a new induction system which incor- porates the following technologies: 1) A variable intake port mechanism called the 6-Port Induction system. 2) A newly- developed intake passage which improves volumetric effi- ciency, utilizing the induction pressure variation generated in the intake manifold. This new induction system is simple in design, light- weight, and low in cost. It allows considerable improvement in performance over the entire engine speed range, without trading away fuel economy in normal vehicle operation. 1983 SAE Transactions 831011. An indoor 60 Hz to 40 GHz facility for total vehicle EMC testing. Gary F. E. Vrooman, Ford Motor Company. This paper describes an indoor electromagnetic compatibil- ity (EMC) testing facility designed to permit complete radi- ated susceptibility and radiated emissions testing of an oper- ating motor vehicle. The facility was designed to provide state-of-the-art performance and permit testing over the wide frequency range normally encountered by a vehicle in an urban and suburban environment. 1983 SAE Transactions 831012. Electromagnetic interference measurements with small sensors and fiber optic systems. Melvin J. Johnson, Southwest Research Institute, San An- tonio, TX. The last decade of research and development has led to tremendous increases in the complexity of electronic devices. It has also led to significant decreases in the size and power requirements of these devices. The combination of these has led to a vastly increased susceptibility potential of electronic products to electromagnetic interference (EMI). This potential has resulted in the requirement to develop small electromagnetic field sensors to assess the susceptibility of engineering prototypes to EMI. This paper presents an overview of the state-of-the-art technology in small electromagnetic field sensor systems, and provides an insight into ongoing research and new developments. 1983 SAE Transactions 831013. A portable data acquisition/statistical analysis system for measuring vehicle RFI characteristics. D. L. Cummins, Ford Motor Company. A new microcomputer-based statistical measurement sys- tem can accurately acquire vehicular ignition generated RFI impulse noise data and quickly reduce it to tabular and plotted outputs of the distributions of amplitudes and of periods between occurrences of a particular amplitude. This user-interactive system obtains distributions generated by all cylinders or, by synchronous electronic gating using a fractional-cylinder window, obtains distributions generated by any portion of any isolated cylinder. It permits quick and effective testing of proposed designs and design changes during the development process. This paper presents system description, system proveout and system application results. 831014. The design of low frequency chambers using com- puter simulation techniques with emphasis on automotive chambers. Joel C. Hungerford, Emer- son &amp; Cuming, Canton, MA, Three dimensional plots of the frequency and spatial be- havior of the transfer function of a reflecting floor anechoic chamber are presented to illustrate the chamber properties. Chamber measurement techniques and the information contained within the data are discussed. Frequency regions where transfer function uncertainties affect the chamber calibration are presented for various combinations of radia- tor and receive antenna heights and chamber reflectivity levels. A conclusion about the proper way to interpret sim- ulation results is also presented. 831015. Development of a vehicle electromagnetic test en- vironment. Donald A. Weber, Eugene D. Knowles, and Robert F. Jansen, BE&amp;C Engi- neers, Inc., Tukwila, WA. An EMC/RFI Test Facility has been designed and con- structed from a new viewpoint - the integrated concept. The fundamental principal is to define the objective of the facil- ity, and determine, through design and modeling, the most cost-effective arrangement. The building, with its support- ing systems, is designed to accomodate the complete facility. The design required several iterations to arrive at the most useful and economical arrangement. The facility described in this paper was designed and constructed in that manner. The elements comprising the facility are: a shielded anechoic chamber, a transverse electromagnetic (TEM) cell, a combined control and RF generator room, and areas for test vehicle preparation. The complete facility will be capable of testing two vehicles, one in the TEM Cell and one in the Shielded Anechoic Chamber. Test frequen- cies can be 60 Hz to 200 MHz in the TEM Cell and 20 MHz to 40 GHz in the larger anechoic chamber. 831016. Automatic test systems for automotive EMC. Wayne L. Minten and Richard S. Napier, Watkins-Johnson Co. The use of the microprocessor and integrated circuits to solve a multitude of automobile safety, pollution and fuel economy problems has unfortunately resulted in reliability problems caused by RF radiation. Electromagnetic Compa- tability (EMC) testing and appropriate design consideration can significantly improve this reliability. The success of any EMC test capability is dependent upon a good understand- ing of the RF radiation effects to the automobile and the electronic equipment required to simulate a wide range of radiated environments. EMC testing for the automobile has 150</page><page sequence="132">831016-831024 taken a new perspective in the past decade. As a result of the complexities of EMC testing, it is important to develop an automatic EMC Test System to get accurate/repeatable re- sults. Automation of EMC testing now permits vast amounts of data to be recorded, processed, analyzed and problems solved in a short period of time. 831018. Anti-dirt property of hot-wire air flow meter. Sa- dayasu Ueno and Kanemasa Sato, Sawa Works, Hitachi, Ltd.; Yoshishige Ohyama, Hitachi Re- search Laboratory, Hitachi Ltd.; and Hisamitsu Yamanaka, Hitachi Automotive Engineering Co. Hitachi has recently developed a hot-wire air flow meter which uses a temperature-sensitive resistor of an extremely thin platinum wire wound around a ceramic bobbin and coated with glass. This temperature-sensitive resistor, or a hot wire, is located in a bypass of the intake air passage of an engine and responds exactly for the effective control of engine operation. The flow meter of this construction is sturdy enough to withstand impacts of backfires and vibra- tion and reduces variation in engine output characteristic likely to be caused by dust and dirt present in the intake air. Furthermore, this device requires no cleaning or other maintenance. 1983 SAE Transactions 831019. A new feedback carburetor with air jet collision control. Katsuyuki Ohsawa, Katsuhiko Sugiya- ma, Kenji Fujikake, and Yoshinori Idota, Toyota Central Research and Development Laboratories, Inc. A new type closed loop A/F control carburetor has been developed. In the carburetor, an air jet, a by-pass stream of an intake air flow, is made to collide with a fuel flow to suppress the flow rate. Studies were made of the basic features of the method such as fuel controlling capability and the factors affecting it from phenomenological consideration and schlieren ob- servation. For comparison, three types of carburetors were pre- pared for the combination of main and idle fuel circuits. In driving mode tests on a dynamometer, a new carburetor which employs the new method for the main fuel circuit, provides 30% lower emission level than an air bleed control carburetor. Higher controlling frequencies were obtained for the new carburetors. The high controllability of the air jet collision control method is attributable to the smaller fluctuation in both the controlling air and the spouting fuel. 1983 SAE Transactions 831020. Managing microcomputer projects. William L. Spetz, Stellar Systems. General characteristics of a microcomputer project are ex- amined and a singular set of management problems typical of such a project is derived. Several practices and proce- dures intended to control these problems and procedures are presented. 831021. A new approach to engine controls. A. Stephen Mihalik, Jr. and Ira Horden, Intel Corp. A new microcontroller has been developed which shows considerable promise for engine control. The controller em- ploys innovative I/O subsystems on chip as well as an ar- chitecture and instruction set to match the real time re- quirements of engine control. 831022. A universal development system for powertrain controls engineers. R. L. Robinson, Ford Motor Co. This paper describes the Universal Development Computer being built to support the development of Electronic Powertrain Control systems at Ford Motor Company. At the heart of Ford's EEC IV system is a custom designed 16 bit 8061 microprocessor. The UDC will provide the tools necessary for advanced concepts implementation prior to inclusion into production prototype designs. The UDC system is based on a module designed to house a variety of components including custom boards that emulate Ford Motor Company's EEC IV system. A commercially available board set containing a 16 bit 8086 microprocessor is used as the human interface. Non- intrusive control and monitoring of the EEC IV (8061) is maintained, as much as possible, with a fully dual-ported memory between the two microprocessors used in the sys- tem. This paper will highlight the basic features and objec- tives of the UDC including: 1. User friendly, interactive control functions 2. Full data acquisition capability 3. Easily configured application hardware and software 4. Multiple processor (dual 806 l's) capability for de- velopment of future, high performance EEC modules. 831023.

SAE interlaboratory test for rolling resistance of passenger car tires - Part I: data variation within and between laboratories. C. A. Brunot, The BFGoodrich Co.; and D. J. Schuring, The Fire- stone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. An interlaboratory test program was carried out by twelve test facilities with the objective to determine the degree of tire rolling resistance loss variations within and between laboratories. The same tires and test procedures were used throughout. Statistical data analysis involving all data as well as various data subgroups suggest that most of today's tire rolling loss test facilities have obtained an excellent level of performance. All measured and analyzed data are tabulated and displaced for each laboratory. 1983 SAE Transactions 831026. SAE interlaboratory test for rolling resistance of passenger car tires - Part II: model and test ma- trix optimization. Dieter J. Schuring, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Central Research Laborato- ries, Akron, OH; and Claude A. Brunot, BF Goodrich Co., Akron, OH. The analysis of tire rolling loss data described in Part I (Data Variation Within and Between Laboratories) was expanded to include a search for an efficient regression model and economical test matrix which combined would satisfy the requirements of simplicity, precision, and univer- sal applicability. Two recommendations were made and compared with the existing SAE Recommended Practice J 1269/70. 1983 SAE Transactions 831027. Tire rolling loss and pressure increase. Dieter J. Schuring and Allen G. Speyer, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. The laboratory practice of measuring tire rolling loss at constant, regulated pressure purposely deviates from in- service operations where the tire air is capped and the pressure varies with tire temperature. Nevertheless, even if the pressure is not allowed to change, the potential pressure increase between the initial (cold) and the equilibrium (hot) state of a tire can be estimated with the help of an equation developed from physical principles. Examples are given for passenger car, light truck, and heavy duty truck tires oper- ated at constant speed but different loads and initial infla- tion pressures. 831028. Prediction of in-cab noise exposure of drivers. Zygmunt F. Reif, Dept. of Mechanical Engineer- ing, University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario; and Thomas N. Moore, F. Jos. Lamb Company Ltd., Windsor, Ontario. The noise levels within truck cabs and the noise exposure of drivers were measured during commercial payload runs with an instrument of special design. Sound levels were continuously recorded within both ears of the driver and at the centre of cab station. It was found that the sound levels within the ears were in most cases significantly higher than those at the centre of cab station and that the greatest exposure existed during freeway driving. A relatively simple formula was developed for the prediction of noise exposure. 831029. Methods for predicting passenger vibration dis- comfort. K. C. Parsons and M. J. Griffin, South- ampton University. Measurements of vehicle vibration and passenger discom- fort have been used to evaluate alternative methods of pre- dicting passenger vibration discomfort. Twelve vibration inputs to the body were considered: three translational and three rotational axes on the seat, three translational axes at the back and three translational axes at the feet. Equivalent comfort contours were obtained by laboratory experimen- tation for all twelve inputs for eight male subjects. The responses of these subjects to the ride in six different cars on twelve different roads were then correlated with nine alter- native methods of averaging the twelve vibration inputs. Evaluation of only the 'worst' vibration input or the 'worst' vibration frequency did not provide good predic- tions. Either the rms or rmq of the frequency and axis weighted accelerations should be determined. The square root of the sums of squares of these twelve values provided the best correlation with the discomfort ratings in the ve- hicles. 1983 SAE Transactions 831032. What automotive design engineers require from the P/M industry. S. M. Kaufman and S. Mocar- ski, Ford Motor Co., Manufacturing Processes Laboratory. A case is presented here for revision and augmentation of P/M specifications and standards. It focusses upon the unique properties of these materials and how they are cur- rently treated. Using an example comparison between P/M steels and cast iron, some of the major problems encoun- tered by designers are illustrated. Recommendations for needed changes and additions to existing specifications and standards for P/M steels are made. 1983 SAE Transactions 831034. Fuel economy ratings vs. road experience - an analysis of Forďs 1982 lease fleet. David L. Kulp and James C. McKenna, Ford Motor Co. 152</page><page sequence="134">831034-831041 Beginning with the 1978 Model Year, Ford Motor Com- pany (Ford) has been collecting and analyzing on-road fuel economy data for Ford vehicles leased by Company em- ployes. The data base for 1978-1982 models includes 46, 634 data points. Data for 1982 models (10,776 data points) indi- cate that on-road fuel economy was 3% better than for 1981 models and 41% above 1978 levels. Further, a comparison of 1982 on-road results to EPA-approved mpg values indi- cates that the percent difference is comparable to those re- ported for the 1979-1981 model year surveys. The previ- ously reported seasonal difference (i.e., summer on-road mpg results are approximately 2 mpg higher than winter results) was substantiated by 1982 model data. Data for different driving patterns (i.e., urban vs. highway driving and different values for miles driven per day) also were ana- lyzed to estimate the effect of "% urban" driving and "miles per day" on in-use mpg results. 831035. Effects of changes in engine geometry on the combustion in an S.I. engine. H. A. Newlyn and P. C. Few, School of Mechanical &amp; Production Engineering, Leicester Polytechnic, Leicester, England. A new expression for the turbulent to laminar flame speed ratio in fully developed combustion in a spark ignition en- gine is proposed. The expression contains parameters related to the basic engine geometry and the inlet systems. Its use in a computer simulation indicates a good indi- cation of the probable effects of changes in engine geometry on the combustion process. 831036. Simulation of automobile brake wear dynamics and estimation of emissions. Soyoung Cha and Philip Carter, Northrop Services, Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC; and Ronald L. Bradow, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Tri- angle Park, NC. Asbestos emissions from automobile brakes were measured under conditions simulating downtown city driving. Refer- ence data for city driving was obtained by measuring vehi- cle speed, time of brake application, cool-down time be- tween applications, brake hydraulic-line pressure and pad temperature. Data from 1800 braking applications were then analyzed to provide a statistical distribution of repre- sentative braking cycles. We constructed a computer-controlled brake emission test rig that simulated road braking operation of a front wheel disc brake and collected airborne wear debris. Repre- sentative braking cycles were programmed on this system to experimentally estimate brake emissions under a variety of braking conditions. Realistic braking operations produced particle and as- bestos emission rates in close agreement with those meas- ured by Williams and Muhlbaier. Asbestos concentration was not correlated with mechanical work done in braking. Application of the asbestos emission rates to air quality models confirmed Willliams and Muhlbaier's finding that about 1% of asbestos fibers in city core districts originated from disc brake wear. 1983 SAE Transactions 831037. Application of irradiated wires in motor vehicles. Shotaro Tada, Ikujiro Uda, Katsuyuki Kana- zawa, and Keiji Ueno, Sumitomo Electric In- dustries, Ltd. The use of irradiation - crosslinked wire for internal wiring has been increasing year by year due to requirements for safety and space reduction of electronic equipment. Also, in the case of motor vehicles, flame retardance, long life, weight reduction, and high reliability of insulation materials have recently become important requirements. Our test results show that irradiation - crosslinked flame-retardant polyethylene-insulated wire rated at 150°C can pass the vertical flame test requirement and, if sur- rounded by ordinary PVC wires in wiring harnesses, can reduce damage to the PVC wires because it does not flow under overcurrent load. Additionally, irradiation- crosslinked PVC wire has been as certained to be outstand- ingly stable under overcurrent load and to have high relia- bility even at low temperatures. 831040. The electric folo-thru starting system. John R. Tallis, Jr. and Charles R. Emmick, Motor Com- ponents Division, Facet Enterprises, Inc. The need for an automotive starting system designed to meet more stringent demands, as well as the contemporary trend to downsize automobiles, has prompted the develop- ment of the Electric Folo-Thru Starting System. This design utilizes a lighter weight, symmetrically shaped starting motor, containing fewer parts, but retains the operator controlled demesh feature, characteristic of conventional positive shift motors. 831041. Computer-assisted implementation of powder forging processes. Howard A. Kuhn, University of Pittsburgh. Computerized methods have been developed for powder preform forging processes to reduce the trial-and-error de- velopment required for preform design and to improve di- mensional control in the finished parts. First, the part vol- ume and volume distribution are calculated from digitized input of the drawings. Die dimensions are then calculated including thermal and elastic effects. Shrink ring dimen- sions and interferences are also calculated if required. Pre- form design is then accomplished using an interactive com- puter program that includes consideration of densification, cracking limits and die chilling. At the present stage of development, some user decisions are necessary and previ- ous experience is helpful for application of the system to complexly-shaped parts. Currently, the completely inte- 153</page><page sequence="135">831041-831067 grated system is ideally applicable to a family of similar parts, such as bearings, cam rings or gears. 1983 SAE Transactions 831042. An assessment of powder metallurgy today and its future potential. Leander F. Pease, III, Powder-Tech Associates, Inc., North Andover, MA. The present level of technology is briefly reviewed in four areas of powder metallurgy: hot forging/forming (P/F), cold forging of sintered preforms, injection molding and sintering of metal powder/plastic mixtures, and high tem- perature sintering. Some historical background on the fac- tors that have slowed the market acceptance of P/F are reviewed as a guide to understanding future growth. Several examples of current commercially produced parts are cited for each technical area. 1983 SAE Transactions 831043. American vs. European vehicles on the ECE fuel consumption cycles. A. C. Gullon and N. Os- trouchov, Environment Canada. The recent publication in Europe of vehicle fuel consump- tion values on standardized test procedures has made it possible to compare the over-the-road energy efficiency of vehicles designed for North America with those designed for Europe. Thirty-six of the former were tested on the three ECE fuel consumption cycles. The results indicate equal or better performance for the American technology and made it possible to calculate "one-way" factors to pre- dict a vehicle's performance on the ECE cycles from the U.S. EPA fuel consumption data for the UDDS and HWFET cycles. 831045. Front and rear suspension of the new Mercedes model W201. Manfred von der Ohe, Daimler- Benz A.G. For the new Mercedes W201 entirely new front and rear suspensions had to be developed, because this small and light weight car was to achieve the same standard of ride and handling qualities, compared with bigger and heavier cars. The paper explains the design of the new suspension systems. One main point is to report on the means, how to control the rear wheel motions by particular elastokinema- tic characteristics. 1983 SAE Transactions 831046.

(P-129) Research and development needs for CNG fueled vehicles. Thomas J. Joyce, T. Joyce Associates, Inc. A comprehensive examination of the research needed to accelerate the acceptance of compressed natural gas as a vehicle fuel has been conducted. The technical problems which have limited acceptance but which may be alleviated through research are poorer engine performance and re- duced driving range as compared to vehicles using liquid fuels. A public perception that CNG is not as safe as gaso- line for public use has been a problem. The identified re- search needs include specific projects which will reduce or eliminate these problems. 831066. (P-129) NGFVs - how large is the potential mar- ket? Robert J. Sprafka, Raymond R.

A principal impediment at present to the growth of the compressed natural gas fueled vehicle (NGFV) fraction of the privately-owned vehicle fleet is the lack of adequate and widespread refueling facilities. Many of the vehicles on the road today could profitably convert to dual fuel operation if refueling facilities existed. For the longer-term, however, the incentive toward conversion may disappear. The emergence of more fuel- efficient gasoline vehicles, the replacement of needed larger vehicles with diesel-powered units, and the general trend toward pricing fuels on Btu content, all minimize the eco- nomic benefit realizable today by operating a converted dual fuel vehicle. Dedicated vehicles specifically designed to operate on compressed natural gas, which take advantage of the prop- erties of this fuel, can help to alleviate some of the vanishing economic incentives, although the refueling-point availabil- ity problem must be solved before such vehicles are com- petitive in the marketplace. This paper examines the above factors and estimates the potential market penetration of retrofit and OEM NGFVs. 831067. (P-129) CNG measurements using PVT relation- ships. Richard P. Wyman, CNG Fuel Systems, Ltd. The need to make accurate measurements of compressed natural gas (CNG) for vehicle refuelling led to an investiga- tion of gas behavior under actual and simulated fill condi- tions. During the past century, scientists and engineers have developed several equations of state to show how gas prop- erties are related. Two popular equations, the AGA and the BWR equations have been used extensively in the gas in- dustry. With the aid of a computer, these equations have 154</page><page sequence="136">831067-831071 been adapted to determine the amount of natural gas by weight, gas volume or heat content in a CNG automotive fuel cylinder. One of the main problems in using PVT relationships is determining gas temperatures. Unlike pressure, it is difficult to directly measure gas temperature due to the hardware constraints of the fuelling system. Direct temperature mea- surements, taken during a carefully monitored quick fill experiment, showed that the temperature dropped below ambient then started to increase until the temperature was 10°C to 20°C (approximately 20°F to 40°F) above ambient. A theoretical study, using the first law of thermodynamics, also showed a dip then increase in temperature. By using the results of the experiment and study, a correction factor was incorporated into the computer program to account for the temperature deviation from ambient. By using the correction factor, a close estimate of gas quantity can be made from the initial and final fill pressure, cylinder size, gas composition and ambient temperature. These estimates agreed well with the quantity of gas meas- ured by a commercial mass flow meter. 1983 SAE Transactions 831068. (P-129) Report of severe abuse tests conducted on composite reinforced aluminum CNG (com- pressed natural gas) vehicle fuel cylinders. Nor- man C. Fawley, CNG Cylinder Corp. Composite Reinforced Aluminum CNG vehicle fuel cylin- ders, fabricated from precision extruded aluminum tube, with hemispherical heads formed on each end and the side- wall reinforced with high-strength composite, offers a weight reduction of up to 50% in containment vessels for storage of CNG as a vehicle fuel. In addition to weight reduction, the basic nature of the aluminum alloy used in CNG cylinders offers a container with high resistance to external corrosion and internal corrosion caused by con- taminants in natural gas. The cylinders are manufactured in 10" and 13" diameters and up to lengths of 72", allowing the efficient conversion of small, medium and heavy duty vehicles to CNG. 831070. (P-129) Sorbent-containing storage systems for natural gas powered vehicles. Amos Golovoy, Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. Natural gas can be used as a vehicular fuel, but its low energy density is a significant drawback. The energy density can be increased by adsorption of the natural gas on high surface area sorbents. The adsorption of methane on acti- vated carbons and molecular sieves was investigated at pressures up to 16 MPa (2300 psig). The improvement in methane storage capacity over empty cylinders is apprecia- ble at low pressures but diminishes as the pressure in- creases. When adsorbed, for example, on 9LXC activated carbon at 3, 7, and 14 MPa the energy density increased by 245%, 100%, and 53%, respectively. Less improvement was observed with molecular sieves. 831071. (P-129) The practical and economic considera- tions of converting highway vehicles to use natu- ral gas as a fuel. Richard L. Bechtold and Tho- mas J. Timbario, Mueller Associates, Inc.; and Raymond R. Tison and Robert J. Sprafka, E:F Technology. Natural gas provides a current, low-cost alternative to the use of gasoline and diesel fuel for highway transportation vehicles. However, due to the capital costs required to use natural gas as a transportation fuel in either compressed (CNG) or liquefied (LNG) forms, some applications are more advantageous than others. Generally, fleets provide the best opportunity for conversion because of the sheer volume of fuel required and because most vehicles return to a single location each day. The advent of small compressors may make conversion to natural gas feasible for private individuals. Presently, the most popular conversions are to CNG due to the limited availability of liquefiers to produce LNG. The available conversion kits favor vehicles with certain characteristics: vehicles should have spark-ignition engines, be large enough to support the weight of the CNG fuel cylinders, consume at least 5 gallons of gasoline each day on average and have sufficient storage volume so that the fuel cylinders do not infringe on required load-carrying volume. The ease of conversion depends greatly on the vehicle. Pickup trucks are usually easy to convert while subcompact cars can present formidable challenges due to space require- ments and load-carrying capacity. The costs of converting to CNG include vehicle con- version costs, refueling station costs, and required operating and maintenance costs. These costs vary according to ve- hicles (how many storage tanks and how difficult the con- versions are), the planned utilization of compressor capacity, whether the vehicles are refueled using slow-fill or fast-fill techniques and the refueling site preparation re- quired. In this paper, these costs are explained and com- piled for the conversion kits and refueling equipment pres- ently available. A few case studies are explored to demonstrate what must be known to evaluate whether a fleet of vehicles has potential to save money using natural gas and how long it may take to see a return on the initial investment. Also discussed in the paper is an overview of CNG safety aspects, especially as related to road and operating restrictions that may exist in some local jurisdictions. Thus, in keeping with the intent of this paper to be a practical guide for decision-makers, reference is made to safety- related considerations and the restrictions which may be imposed by some states or municipalities on CNG vehicle operation. 155</page><page sequence="137">831073-831090 831073. (P-129) The dual fuel engine of the compression ignition type - prospects, problems and solu- tions - a review. G. A. Karim, Dept. of Mechani- cal Engineering, The University of Calgary, Cal- gary, Alberta, Canada. A review is made of some of the main problems associated with the use of natural gas, notably methane, in dual fuel engines of the compression ignition diesel type. It is shown that such applications represent in principle a very attrac- tive mode for the utilization of the fuel for the production of power generally at relatively high efficiencies and outputs with good exhaust emissions characteristics. Some relevant solutions to the problems outlined are then discussed. Moreover, some further research and development needed in this general area is also outlined. 1983 SAE Transactions 831074. (P-129) High performance methane engines. M. R. Seal, Vehicle Research Institute, Western Washington Univ. Several approaches to recovering power lost in a methane conversion are discussed in the paper. High compression, turbocharging and improved breathing capability were in- vestigated. The base engine was 1781 cc aluminum boxer- type four-cylinder engine. Compression ratios as high as 12.3:1 were tried as was 20 PSI turbocharger boost. Four- valve-per-cylinder heads were manufactured and tested. The original BHP of the engine on gasoline (71 BHP) was more than doubled on methane. 831076. (P-129) A team effort in compressed natural gas fleet conversion. Jerrold L. Hutton, Hocking Technical College, Nelsonville, OH; and Paul Shaffer, Ohio Transmission and Pump, Newark, OH. Hocking Technical College struck natural gas at an oil well head on its campus in winter of 1982. Seeing the possibili- ties for fleet fueling and training of automotive students, the college negotiated an agreement with JOY Incorporated of New Lexington, Ohio, by which the college would provide training for JOY personnel and other interested individuals while JOY would demonstrate conversion of conventionally fueled vehicles to CNG. This paper discusses the process of and problems with vehicle conversion as it is taking place on the college campus. Students are being trained in every aspect of CNG conversion, maintenance and trouble- shooting, as well as compressor training and purification of the gas itself. Training programs are available in fill station and maintenance. 831077. (P-129) U.S. Postal Service operating experience with a CNG fueled delivery fleet. John R. Messe- ra, Office of General Systems Development, Re- search and Development Laboratories, United States Postal Service. Significant fuel cost reductions are being achieved using Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) in lieu of gasoline as a vehicular fuel in Postal delivery vehicles. A total of 98 operational vehicles have been converted for dual fuel oper- ation. In a twelve month period the vehicles traveled 446,815 miles on CNG vs. 109,649 miles on gasoline. CNG usage has increased from 29% in the first month of opera- tion to 89% in the twelfth. Fuel costs were 9.9 cents per mile for CNG as compared to 14.9 cents per mile for gaso- line. 831078. (P-129) Safety issues surrounding the use and operation of compressed natural gas vehicles. Raymond R. Tison and Robert J. Sprafka, E:F Technology, Inc., St. Johns, MI; and Richard L. Bechtold and Thomas J. Timbario, Mueller Asso- ciates, Inc., Baltimore, MD. With more and more fleet vehicles being converted to com- pressed natural gas operation, concerns have arisen about the safety of their fuel systems and the need for regulations to ensure safe operation. The potential for widespread oper- ation of vehicles using compressed natural gas adds urgency to these concerns. Most of the safety concerns revolve around the high- pressure storage and fuel lines present in existing systems. Specific items in question are: the need for high-pressure automatic fuel cutoff switches, vehicle disablement during refueling, the need for methane sensors, cylinder specifica- tions and venting requirements, location of refueling points, and system crash-worthiness. This paper examines these concerns. 831090. The development of a space shuttle General Pur- pose Work Station (GPWS). Phillip A. Wagner, Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co., Sunnyvale, CA. The use of the European Space Agency's Spacelab aboard the NASA Space Shuttle Transportation System offers the opportunity for the world's scientific community to con- duct a broad scope of experiments in a zero gravity earth orbit environment. Included in these experiments will be many in the life sciences area, and these will need equip- ment which will allow working in this specialized environ- ment. This paper describes the design and testing of a Gen- eral Purpose Work Station (GPWS) which will provide a facility that allows experiments to be conducted in the Spacelab. It is intended primarily to support life science experiments, although support of many others is possible. The GPWS provides both experiment and operator biologi- cal protection and a "clean room" environment, controls liquids in zero gravity, controls experiment chemical vapors thus preventing Spacelab cabin contamination, and pro- vides a working area with lights and other user accommo- dations. Either 1 or 2 operators can be accommodated in the zero gravity neutral body position. The unit is self- contained and is mounted in a double ESA rack. The De- sign Verification Unit has been built and tested. The flight 156</page><page sequence="138">831090-831097 unit has been designed and is being manufactured. The de- scription includes both units. 831091. The design and development of a vapor com- pression refrigerator/freezer for Spacelab. Abdul Hye, Management &amp; Technical Services Co., Houston, TX. A computer simulation was performed to determine the design criteria for a spacelab refrigerator/freezer using the test results of a vapor compression refrigerator/freezer which flew on STS-4 without problem. It has been estab- lished to have a vapor Reynolds number over 3000 at a vapor quality of 0.2 to maintain annular boiling in the evap- orator and for the condenser to have a vapor Reynolds number over 15000 at its inlet to maintain annular conden- sation. These two constraints will virtually eliminate the effect of gravity on the performance of the refrigerator/freezer. These results are being used to build a refrigerator/freezer which will fly in Spacelab-4 scheduled for launch in December 1985. 831092. The LSLE Echocardiograph: commercial hard- ware aboard spacelab. Ray Schwarz, Manage- ment and Technical Services Co. Ultrasonic Medical Imaging Equipment, packaged for use on the Shuttle Spacelab, will put a sophisticated medical research device in space. Adaptation of this commercial system paves the way for complex commercial hardware aboard Shuttle. The Echocardiograph generates a real-time image of the heart which will be recorded on video tape. The hardware of choice is the Hewlett-Packard model 77020AC Ultrasound Imaging System. Modifications in- clude extensive repackaging and substitution of mil-spec power supplies. The self-testing features of the Hewlett- Packard design will allow flight system check-out with very little ground support equipment. Medical research applica- tions in spaceflight include the measurement of cardiac output, stroke volume, and heart wall motion in o-g. How a commercial product can be made to meet NASA space- craft standards is the subject of this article. 831093. The layout of a laboratory for life sciences exper- iments in space. Dennis J. Grounds, General Electric Co., Houston, TX. The process of developing a configuration layout of Life Sciences experiments in the Spacelab module requires both engineering and management judgement in order to be suc- cessful. As experiments are being developed for the dedi- cated Life Sciences mission, the many factors which deter- mine the final configuration are being managed through a set of prioritized objectives. From an initial configuration which best meets the objectives stated above, an iterative process begins. When changes in equipment design or operation occur affecting the layout, the available options are considered. The deci- sion may affect the room for growth, stowage capacity, complexity of interconnections, altered efficiency of opera- tion, or constraints imposed on equipment developers. 831094. Ames Research Center Life Sciences Payload Project for Spacelab Mission 3. Paul X. Callahan and John Tremor, NASA/ Ames Research Cen- ter, Moflfett Field, CA; and Gordon Lund and William L. Wagner, MATSCO/Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA. A Research Animal Holding Facility has been developed to support rodent and squirrel monkey animal husbandry in the Spacelab environment. While successful ground testing will assure satisfactory performance in 1-g, verification of the hardware under weightless conditions must be per- formed in space. This verification will be achieved on the Spacelab Mission 3 flight. This paper describes the configuration and function of the Payload hardware elements, the assembly and test pro- gram, the operational rationale and the scientific approach to Payload evaluation for this flight. 831096. Primate metabolic system for shuttle. Nello Pace, Environmental Physiology Laboratory, Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA; and Terry Secord, McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co., Hunting- ton Beach, CA. Metabolic research in the weightlessness of spaceflight is required to fill major gaps in our understanding of the role of gravity for life on earth. This paper presents an appraisal of the scientific need for metabolic research and reviews a proposed Primate Metabolic System (PMS) that is rack- mounted for early flight in the Shuttle mid-deck. The use of the PMS on early short-duration flights can serve as the first element of a metabolic research facility for animal studies in space and will permit a sound appraisal of the physiological well-being of animals introduced into the spaceflight environment while establishing baseline physio- logical data and hardware design verification prior to com- mittment to longer duration manned flights. 831097. Thermal management system technology develop- ment for space station applications. J. Gary Ran- kin and Paul F. Marshall, NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX. Advanced planning within NASA is currently being fo- cused on a manned Space Station as the next major step in the U.S. space program. Capabilities such as evolutionary growth on-orbit, indefinite life through maintenance, and flexibility to accommodate a time-varying complement of users constitute requirements for the Space Station thermal management system that are radically different from those of previous or current missions. Anticipating the need to identify the technology re- quired for long-life, high-power orbital platforms/stations, NASA began a multicenter thermal management system technology development program in 1979. This program, 157</page><page sequence="139">831097-831102 sponsored by the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technol- ogy, has continued to evolve in parallel with the increasingly detailed planning for a Space Station program. This paper presents a short discussion of the program history to date, provides a "snapshot" of the current status of several ongoing studies and hardware demonstration tasks, and discusses future technology development plans. 831098. Concept evaluation of four thermal utility sys- tems for low orbit spacecraft. George P. Peter- son, Texas A&amp;M Univ.; and Dennis D. Stalmach, Vought Corp. Future long term missions in space require the development of a thermal management system capable of collecting, transporting and rejecting waste heat from various compo- nents in the nominal temperature range of 0-100°C. A sum- mary of four, two-phase heat transport systems currently under consideration at NASA-JSC is presented. The com- parative merits of four systems, which include a mechani- cally pumped two-phase loop, a capillary pumped loop, an osmotic pumped loop and a loop using a biomorph pump, are presented based on a comprehensive literature review and contractor reports supplied by NASA-JSC. A recommended conceptual design for a thermal util- ity using a capillary pumped loop is proposed along with an evaluation of its strengths and weaknesses. System start up and control are discussed and areas of continued investiga- tion are identified. 831099. A pumped two-phase cooling system for space- craft. S. Ollendorf, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; and F. A. Costello, Frederick A. Costello, Inc. A pumped, two-phase heat-transport system is being devel- oped for possible use for temperature control of scientific instruments on future NASA missions. As compared to a single-phase system, this two-phase system can maintain tighter temperature control with less pumping power. A laboratory model of the system has been built and tested. The measured heat transfer coefficients were approximately the same as in heat pipes, 220 Btu/hr-ft2-F, as compared to 25 Btu/hr-ft2-F for single-phase liquid flow. Heat sharing between experiments has been demonstrated wherein vapor generated in the cold plate of an active experiment was condensed in a cold, unheated experiment. System stability has been observed. However, additional development is needed. The use of non-azeotropic mixtures of coolants appears especially promising as a simple way to determine exit quality and thus control the flow rates to prevent dryout. 831100. Vacuum contact conductance test results for cold-plate mounted components. L. R. Price, McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co., Hunting- ton Beach, CA. Spacecraft cold-plate designs are small, relatively complex, and expensive. A large-size, low-cost approach is required for the new generation of space power modules and plat- forms. This paper describes part of an on-going investiga- tion of the feasibility of using large aluminum extrusions attached side-by-side to form a large, two-sided cold plate with integral coolant passages. The objective was to establish and verify a cold-plate- to-equipment interface design that would meet thermal per- formance requirements and allow easy replacement by ex- travehicular activity (EVA) component changeout. Approximately twelve filler materials and six interface de- signs were studied, and these were selected: three filler ap- proaches, an existing adjustable interface pressure design, and a conventional design with no filler and no adjustment. Thermal conductance tests performed on simulated im- plementations of these approaches measured the contact conductances of each. Two designs met thermal as well as operational requirements. 831101. A contact conductance interface for a space con- structable heat pipe radiator. John A. Oren and Michael L. Fleming, Vought Corp., Dallas, TX. A connectable/disconnectable thermal interface has been developed for the constructable radiator system under de- velopment at NASA-Johnson Space Center. A contact heat exchanger approach which involves pressurized clamping of a segmented cylindrical heat exchanger on the outside of a round heat pipe evaporator section was designed, fabri- cated, and tested. Dry metal-to-metal contact conductance heat transfer is utilized. Test results have indicated excel- lent contact conductances of up to 8500 w/m2°c (1500 Btu/ft2°F) at 2000 kPa (300 psi) clamping force. The feasi- bility and fabricability of the design have been demon- strated. 831102. Articulated heat pipe concepts and developments. Donald M. Ernst and Robert M. Shaubach, Ther- macore, Inc., Lancaster, PA. Reliable, low mass rotating heat transfer joints using heat pipes have many potential on-board spacecraft applications including hinges, rotating platforms and moveable radia- tors. These joints require a high thermal conductance and low outgassing and fluid leakage rates to prevent spacecraft contamination. This paper describes two concepts: the first has the joint in the heat pipe envelope; the second utilizes a high thermally conductive fluid in a gap between two sepa- rate heat pipes, one located inside the other. The second concept has been pursued through the testing of a developmental heat pipe-to-heat pipe joint. Thermal performance up to 1500 watts showed a joint ther- mal resistance of 0.008 to 0.01 C/watt (thermal conduc- tance of 100-125 watts/C) in the temperature range of 25-50 C. Theoretical calculations show the gap fluid leak- age to be less than 1 X 10'5 grams of NaK in five years. Extended rotary life test, seal design, fluid leakage measure- 158</page><page sequence="140">831102-831108 ment and improved heat pipe performance are areas of future development. 831103. Thermal characteristics of standardized Air Force avionic enclosures. James L. Franklin and Charles F. Leonard, Boeing Aerospace Co. A series of thermal analyses and tests have been conducted on several avionic enclosures, or "black boxes", with the enclosure designs being representative of those covered un- der a new Air Force standard. As a part of this effort, the thermal characteristics of various state-of-the-art hardware elements were investigated, including their effect on overall enclosure thermal performance. Using this data, analyses and tests were then carried out on complete enclosures, with the results indicating that power levels up to 1 watt/in3 could be achieved without exceeding device junc- tion temperature limits. 831104. Heat-powered environmental control systems for fighter aircraft. J. E. Stone and T. L. Weirich, McDonnell Douglas Corp. Heat powered ECS concepts using a Rankine or Stirling power cycle to drive a vapor compression refrigeration cy- cle were evaluated for future fighter aircraft. Arrangements with separated power cycle and refrigeration cycle working fluids were considered, as were arrangements combining these cycles via a common working fluid. Promising heat sources and working fluids for these concepts were identified. Waste heat sources in the propul- sion system and airframe were compared with regard to heat capacity, temperature level, and collection system de- sign complexity. A screening process, which distinguished between the requirements imposed by the power cycle and refrigeration cycle, was developed to select promising work- ing fluids. Concepts were evaluated using various system arrange- ments, heat sources, and working fluids to minimize the ECS-related TOGW penalty. The most attractive heat powered ECS concept was found to be a configuration us- ing a Rankine power cycle integrated with the refrigeration cycle through a common working fluid, Freon R-ll. How- ever, the predicted TOGW penalty for this concept is still 23% higher than for a conventionally (electric motor) powered vapor compression refrigeration cycle concept. 831105. Capabilities and limitations of air cooled avionic packages. Landon A. Strattan, Hughes Aircraft Co., El Segundo, CA. Currently, avionics equipment depends primarily on forced air cooling for thermal control. The electronic parts are mounted on cards which are enclosed in an electronic en- closure to facilitate packaging and cooling of high density electronic packages found in present day avionics equip- ment. Three types of thermal designs, classified according to how air is used to cool the cards, are commonly used. The three types are air impingement cooled, conduction to coldwall, and flow through cooling in the card itself. The cooling capacity of the designs vary, with air impingement cards having the least cooling capacity and the flow through cards having the highest cooling capacity. Flow through cards are capable of cooling electrical power densi- ties of up to 3098 watts/m2 (2 watts/in2) and 7.06 X104 watts/m3 (2000 watts/ft3) of volume. Although fairly high power density levels can be cooled with forced air cooling, the practical limit of power density that can be adequately cooled may soon be exceeded, because of the continuing trend toward higher electronic packaging density. Methods of estimating cooling capacities for the above designs are presented herein as well as the limitations imposed when cooling with forced air. 831106. Heat exchanger modeling accounting for conden- sation and temperature pinch. G. Eugene Wilmot and Douglas L. Christians, Hamilton Standard, Division of United Technologies. High performance heat exchangers are used extensively in aircraft environmental control systems. Current state-of- the-art systems incorporate heat exchangers that have con- densation. System modeling requires a heat exchanger rep- resentation that appropriately accounts for moisture phase change. A phenomenon referred to as temperature pinch significantly affects heat exchangers. This effect is not typi- cally considered due to its complexity. This paper describes a model that is representative of the temperature pinch effect. 831107. A systems approach - minimizing avionics Life cycle cost. Robert L. Berger, Aeronautical Sys- tems Div., Air Force Systems Command, United States Air Force. This paper introduces a new concept in air-airframe envi- ronmental control system (ECS) and avionics (airborne electronic equipment) integration which provides a method of optimizing system reliability while minimizing system life cycle cost (LCC). This concept is being introduced un- der a new program sponsored by the Aeronautical Systems Division at Wright-Patterson AFB for defining equipment thermal and reliability requirements and optimizing cooling capacity and its allocation to equipments. The proposed systems approach provides increased effectiveness in achieving reliability throughout the acquisition process. This is accomplished by putting product assurance in the hands of the design engineers rather than relying totally on the test or quality control engineer. The concept addresses specific tasks that need to be accomplished at both the system and subsystem levels to ensure the integrity of the total program. It generally is applicable to any electronic equipment, military or commercial. 831108. Environmental control and life support for an evolutionary space station. P. D. Quattrone, Na- tional Aeronautics and Space Administration, 159</page><page sequence="141">831108-831112 Ames Research Center; and R. A. Wynveen, Life Systems, Inc. The requirements for the Space Station are being defined. The Environmental Control/Life Support System (ECLSS) is one of its 13 systems. The ECLSS is further divided into five functional categories. Major ones are the Air Revitali- zation and Water Reclamation Systems. The paper presents ECLSS performance requirements, average design loads and fluids interfaces. The major cost savings of regenerable ECLSS techniques versus the open loop approach are quan- tified. Issues impacting ECLSS design are cited. Priority regenerable ECLSS developments are re- viewed including the Electrochemical CO2 Concentrator, Static Feed Electrolyzer and Automated Control/Monitor Instrumentation. Baseline and alternative approaches are cited. The ECLSS planning issues are reviewed including functional boundaries, planning schedule, technology ma- turity definition and technology gaps. The paper concludes with a review of water electrolysis as a Space Station utility impacting ECLSS design. 831109. Systems engineering aspects of a preliminary conceptual design of the space station environ- mental control and life support system. C. H. Lin and M. S. Meyer, NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX. A preliminary conceptual design of the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS), consisting of an initial and a growth version, has been developed for the proposed Space Station. This paper addresses the systems engineering approach taken in the course of planning, inte- grating, and developing the conceptual design. The ap- proach includes defining system requirements and groun- drules for the trade study, formulating possible options for cycle closure, establishing system-level mass balances, per- forming the trade-off study in search of an optimal degree of cycle closure, and constructing the conceptual design. The interdependency of the oxygen, water, and food cycles in the ECLSS is discussed and analyzed with system-level mass balances. The trade-off study, which focuses on launch and resupply weight and volume requirements as well as life cycle costs of the system, is summarized. The study strongly suggests that a partially closed cycle ECLSS using state-of-the-art regenerative life support technology is the optimal option for cycle closure. 831110. Integrated atmosphere revitalization system de- scription and test results. Rex. B. Martin, Nick Lance, and Robert J. Cusick, NASA Johnson Space Center; and Arthur T. Linton, Boeing Aerospace Co. Regenerative-type subsystems are being tested at JSC to provide atmosphere revitalization functions of oxygen sup- ply and carbon dioxide (C02) removal for a future Space Station. Oxygen is supplied by an electrolysis subsystem, developed by General Electric, Wilmington, Mass., which uses the product water from either the C02 reduction sub- system or a water reclamation process. C02 is removed and concentrated by an electrochemical process, developed by Life Systems, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio. The concentrated C02 is reduced in a Sabatier process with the hydrogen from the electrolysis process to water and methane. This subsystem is developed by Hamilton Standard, Windsor Locks, Conn. These subsystems are being integrated into an atmosphere revitalization group. This paper describes the integrated test configuration and the initial checkout test. The feasibility and design compatibility of these subsystems integrated into an air revitalization system is discussed. 831111. Integrated water management system description and test results. N. C. Eiden, H. E. Winkler, and D. F. Price, NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX; and R. P. Reysa, Boeing Aerospace Co., Houston, TX. Water recovery subsystems are being tested at the NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center for Space Station use to process waste water generated from urine and wash water collection facilities. These subsystems are being integrated into a water management system that will incorporate wash water and urine processing through the use of hyperfiltra- tion and vapor compression distillation subsystems. Other hardware in the water management system includes a whole body shower, a clothes washing facility, a urine collection and pretreatment unit, a recovered water post-treatment system, and a water quality monitor. This paper describes the integrated test configuration, pertinent performance data, and feasibility and design compatibility conclusions of the integrated water management system. 831112. Hyperfiltration Wash Water Recovery Subsys- tem - design and test results. R. P. Reysa, Boeing Aerospace Co., Houston, TX; D. F. Price, NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX; T. Olcott, Lockheed Missiles and Space Corp., Palo Alto, CA; and J. L. Gaddis, Clemson University, Clem- son, SC. The Hyperfiltration Wash Water Recovery Subsystem is considered the most promising water recovery process for the large quantities of wash water needed for a Space Sta- tion. A preprototype Hyperfiltration Subsystem has been developed by Lockheed Missiles and Space Corporation (LMSC) to satisfy projected wash water recovery require- ments of 10.9 Kgms/hr (24 lbs/hr) utilizing a hyperfiltra- tion module consisting of cintered metal tubes having a polymeric filtration layer. Two hyperfiltration module de- signs, manufactured by Abcor, Inc. and Carre, Inc., are currently being evaluated at NASA JSC. This paper pre- sents a description of the preprototype subsystem design and important design features, configuration, module test results comparisons, and recommendations for future devel- opment and testing. 160</page><page sequence="142">831113-831118 831113. Urine pretreatment for waste water processing systems. H. Eugene Winkler and Charles E. Ve- rostko, National Aeronautics and Space Admin- istration, Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX; and Gerard F. Dehner, Hamilton Standard, Division of United Technologies Corp., Windsor Locks, CT. Recovery of high quality water from urine is an essential part of life support on a Space Station to avoid costly launch and resupply penalties. Water can be effectively re- covered from urine by distillation following pretreatment by a chemical agent to inhibit microorganism contamina- tion and fix volatile ammonia constituents. This paper pre- sents the results of laboratory investigations of several pretreatment chemicals which were tested at several con- centration levels in combination with sulfuric acid in urine. The optimum pretreatment formulation was then evaluated with urine in the Hamilton Standard Thermoelectric Inte- grated Membrane Evaporation Subsystem (TIMES). Over 2,600 hours of test time was accumulated. Results of these laboratory and system tests are presented in this paper. 831114. Shuttle Orbiter radiator performance during the OFT Program. Donald J. Benko, Vought Corp., Dallas, TX. The Space Shuttle Orbiter has completed its orbital flight test program and is presently in its operational phase. A critical element in its on-orbit operations is the performance of its radiators in rejecting waste heat. The performance of the radiator system was carefully monitored throughout the flight test program. Therefore, heat rejection data has been gathered in a variety of space environmental conditions and operational configurations. This paper presents an evaluation of the heat rejection performance of the Orbiter radiator system during the test program. A discussion of the analytical tools used in pre- dicting the system's performance is included. Further dis- cussion is made about the future expectations of radiator performance and the effects it will have on Orbiter opera- tions. 831115. Ablative radome materials thermal-ablation and erosion modeling. Michael R. McHenry and Ber- nard Laub, Acurex Corp., Aerotherm Div. Continued increases in the speed of tactical systems have forced current ceramic radome materials to perform near their operational limits for thermal stresses. In addition, the all-weather requirements for emerging systems and the po- tential for erosion and fracture from particle impacts have necessitated the development of improved radome materials for these environments. Among the concepts being devel- oped for these applications is a class of reinforced ablative materials which consist of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filled with borosilicate or glass in either particulate or mic- rofiber form. RT/duroid is a material of this class and has attractive thermal and electrical properties. However, an accurate definition of the ablation-erosion and thermal per- formance of materials is required since transmission charac- teristics are sensitive to radome thickness and temperature. This paper reports the results of a combined experimental-analytical program that was conducted to de- fine the thermal-ablation and erosion performance of RT/duroid 5870M, a candidate ablative radome material. The resultant thermal-ablation model is demonstrated to provide excellent predictions of thermochemical ablation and in-depth thermal response. The shape change of RT/duroid 5870M models in the clear air and rain environ- ments of Holloman Mach 5 sled tests is also well predicted by a computer code that uses the ablation model and an erosion model based on work by Letson and Schmitt. 831116. Two-dimensional thermal design properties for charring composites. Robin A. S. Beck and Ber- nard Laub, Acurex Corp., Aerotherm Div. A method has been developed for deriving "effective" ther- mal properties for charring composite materials which yield accuracy equivalent to the best charring models. Such "ef- fective" properties have application for two- and three- dimensional thermal analyses where appropriate charring codes either do not exist or would be prohibitively expen- sive. 831117. Moisture absorption characteristics of the Orbi- ter thermal protection system and methods used to prevent water ingestion. Calvin Schomburg, Robert L. Dotts, and Donald J. Tillian, NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. This paper describes the Orbiter silica tile thermal protec- tion system (TPS); the inherent moisture absorption prob- lems associated with low-density, highly porous insulation systems; and methods used to minimize and/or prevent water ingestion into the TPS tile. The test programs associ- ated with developing water repellent agents for the tiles, application technique development, flight test program re- sults, and material improvements are discussed. 831118. The shuttle Orbiter thermal protection system materials, designs, and flight performance over- view. Robert L. Dotts, Donald M. Curry, and Donald J. Tillian, NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. The design requirements for the Orbiter thermal protection system (TPS), the various TPS materials that are used, the different design approaches associated with each of the ma- terials, and the performance experienced during the flight test program are described. The first five flights of the Orbi- ter Columbia have provided the necessary data to verify the TPS thermal performance, structural integrity, and reusa- bility. The flight performance characteristics of each TPS material are discussed. This discussion is based on post- flight inspections and postflight interpretation of the flight instrumentation data. The flights to date indicate that the 161</page><page sequence="143">831118-831122 thermal and structural design requirements for the Orbiter TPS have been met and that the overall performance has been outstanding. 831119. Electronic cooling design and test validation. William B. Murtha, Martin Marietta Corp., Bal- timore Aerospace Div An electronic cooling design and test approach utilizing a counter flow air-cooled heat exchanger is presented. The design is particularly applicable to military (i.e., Navy) weapon systems where extended reliability in harsh thermal and dynamic environments and simplicity of design are of paramount importance. Analytical modeling techniques were utilized to perform design tradeoffs, define heat ex- changer air flow rates and predict steady-state semiconduc- tor operating temperatures for worst-case duty cycles and ambient conditions. Environmental testing was conducted on an instrumented development unit to prove-out the cool- ing design and validate high reliability performance. This paper encompasses the cooling system selection and design and the environmental test results. Heat exchanger per- formance ratings as well as measured component tempera- tures are presented. 831120. Electrochemical and steam-desorbed amine C02 concentration: subsystem comparison. D. B. Heppner and F. H. Schubert, Life Systems, Inc. There are two techniques being considered for carbon diox- ide (C02) removal and concentration for application in a regenerable Environmental Control and Life SuppQrt Sys- tems (EC/LSS) aboard the projected Space Station. One uses the continuous Electrochemical Depolarized CQ2 Con- centration (EDC) technique while the second uses the cy- clic absorption and desorption (with steam) from an amine resin bed. While the technologies involved with these tech- niques are substantially different, each must interface with other elements of a regenerable EC/LSS. This paper pre- sents a comparison of the two competing technologies and includes the design and sizing of the respective subsystems for a Space Station application. The analysis includes iden- tification of assumptions and groundrules with particular attention given to defining subsystem boundaries. These boundaries are defined as all the hardware required for each technique to replace the nonregenerable (i.e., lithium hy- droxide, LiOH) approach to C02 removal used on prior space missions. The analysis determined total equivalent weight which includes fixed hardware weight and weight penalties for power needs and heat rejection requirements. Datą for the subsystems was acquired through NASA and other published sources. While not a detailed discussion of the respective technologies, this paper examines the various merits including the advantages and disadvantages and op- erational impacts (e.g., light and dark cycle operation) of the subsystems. 831121. Transport of binary mixtures of trace contami- nants through an adsorber bed. Richard Madey, Daniel Rothstein, and Bao-Gang Wu, Depart- ment of Physics, Kent State University, Kent, OH; and Jan-Chan Huang, Department of Phys- ics, Kent State University, Kent, OH, Present Address: General Electric Co., Schenectady, NY. We measured the isothermal transmission of two binary mixtures of hydrocarbons through an adsorber bed at 25°C packed with crosslinked polystyrene beads. Transmission is the ratio of the outlet to the inlet concentration. Interfer- ence between co-adsorbing gases is manifested by a reduc- tion of the adsorption capacity of each component in the mixture from that obtained in a single-component experi- ment and by a transmission greater than unity for the weaker-adsorbing component until the stronger-adsorbing component elutes. Binary mixtures of n-butane and propane at 25°C reveal both interference phenomena, whereas bi- nary mixtures of n-butane and 1,3-butadiene at 25°C with concentrations from -1000 to 5000 ppm do not reveal the "overshoot" phenomena. 831122. Phase change water recovery techniques: vapor compression distillation and thermoelectric/membrane concepts. F. H. Schubert, Life Systems, Inc. Two techniques are being considered for the recovery of water from urine and from other waste waters as part of regenerative life support aboard the projected Space Sta- tion. One is the Vapor Compression Distillation (VCD) process while the other is based on a thermoelectric/mem- brane evaporation concept. Both use a phase change recov- ery process, and both try to minimize the energy input per unit mass of water recovered by using the heat released from condensation as the heat of evaporation for steam generation, i.e., operate at a Coefficient of Performance (COP) of greater than unity. The VCD process compresses steam to achieve the desired temperature differential to transfer the heat of condensation to the evaporation site, while the thermoelectric/membrane concept uses the Pel- tier effect. This paper describes a projected Water Reclama- tion System (WRS) of the Space Station's Environmental Control/Life Support System (ECLSS), in general, and de- fines in detail the two phase change concepts culminating in a comparison of these competing technologies. The analyses are based on current Space Station ground rules and re- quirements. The subsystem schematics, configurations and their operation are defined, including sizing of components, to form the basis of the comparison. Total equivalent weights for each subsystem, based on fixed hardware weight and power and heat rejection penalties are presented. The VCD process has a clear advantage over the thermoelec- tric/membrane concept even when operating at 305 K (90 F) versus 339 K (150 F). The thermoelectric concept is 26% heavier, has a 56% higher total equivalent weight and needs over twice the energy per unit mass of water recov- 162</page><page sequence="144">831122-831129 ered. The data and results presented and conclusions drawn are based on test experience at Life Systems and on informa- tion available in the literature. 831123. A two-phase cooling system for the Jetfoil visual augmentation system. Robert H. Hamasaki, Janet L. Abe, and James L. Franklin, Boeing Aero- space Co. A novel cooling system, utilizing two-phase thermosyphon principles, has been developed for temperature control of the Boeing Jetfoil's night vision system. Analyses and tests conducted on this unit have shown that it can replace a current single-phase, forced liquid loop with minimal ther- mal penalty. In addition, the two-phase system is considera- bly lighter, and much quieter than the existing system. 831124. The Thermal Canister: an instrument thermal control system. William Harwell, Grumman Aerospace Corp., Bethpage, NY. The Thermal Canister is a proof of concept experiment flown on the third flight of the Space Shuttle (March 1982). The canister utilizes heat pipe technology to provide a closely controlled, stable temperature environment for sci- entific instruments negating the effects of the harsh, varia- ble shuttle environment. Primary objectives were to demon- strate control at 15° ± 2°C in each of the four external environments experienced by the shuttle. Secondary objec- tives were to control different side panels of the canister simultaneously to different temperatures in the 5° to 25°C range. The canister met all flight objectives. 1983 SAE Transactions 831125. Orbiter radiator panel solar focusing test. Harold R. Howell, Vought Corp.; and J. Gary Rankin, NASA-Johnson Space Center. Test data are presented which define the area around the Orbiter radiator panels for which the solar reflections are concentrated to one-sun or more. The concave shape of the panels and their specular silver/Teflon coating causes fo- cusing of the reflected solar energy which could have ad- verse heating effects on equipment or astronaut extravehic- ular activity (EVA) in the vicinity of the radiator panels. A room ambient test method was utilized with a one-tenth scale model of the radiator panels. 831126. Analytical investigation of junction temperatures for a pulsed GaAs laser. John R. Łapiński, Jr., McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co. This paper summarizes a recent analytical study of a pulsed Gallium Arsenide diode laser. The study was conducted to investigate the maximum junction temperature for a pulsed diode and to explore the possibility of junction temperature reduction by varying the diode pulse duration and changing the diode mounting configuration. Due to large local heat generation, the junction's temperature quickly rises during the pulse, and large temperature gradients are created in several directions. For a given diode column and optical power level, the effects of diode length and pulse duration on junction temperatures were examined. Also, mounting configurations were investigated to the extent of varying top and bottom mounting plate thicknesses. Variation of the diode length and pulse duration provided the most potential for the reduction of junction temperatures, while minimum copper mounting plate thicknesses are required for the pre- vention of sharp increases in junction temperatures. 831127. A compact high intensity cooler (CHIC). T. J. Bland, R. E. Niggemann, and M. B. Parekh, Sundstrand Advanced Technology Group, Divi- sion of Sundstrand Corporation, Rockford, IL. A unique heat exchanger has been developed with potential applications for cooling high power density electronics and perhaps high energy laser mirrors. The device was designed to absorb heat fluxes of approximately 50 w/cm2 (158,000 Btu/hr.ft2) with a low thermal resistance, a high surface temperature uniformity and very low hydraulic pumping power. A stack of thin copper orifice plates and spacers was bonded together and arranged to provide liquid jet impinge- ment heat transfer on successive plates. This configuration resulted in effective heat transfer coefficients, based on the prime surface, of about 85,000 w/m2 °C (15,000 Btu/hr.ft2 °F) and 1.8 watts (.002 HP) hydraulic power with liquid Freon 1 1 as coolant. 1983 SAE Transactions 831128. Impact of Citadels on damage control in Naval ships: an open challenge. Carl H. Pohler and F. Duane Duff, Naval Sea Systems Command; Stan- ley M. Finger and William R. McWhirter, David Taylor Naval Ship R&amp;D Center; Joseph T. Leo- nard, Naval Research Laboratory; and Arthur W. Schmidt, Gibbs &amp; Cox, Inc. In response to the requirement to operate in an environ- ment contaminated by chemical and biological warfare agents, the Navy is designing Citadels containing Collective Protection Systems (CPS) on all ships starting in 1985. The CPS uses internal pressurization, air locks and filtration to prevent the ingress of contaminants into the ship's interior. CPS impacts significantly on all phases of ship engineering design integration and correspondingly on ship system con- figuration and operations. The introduction of CPS on Navy ships requires a re-examination of Damage Control philosophy with special emphasis on maintaining combat readiness. 831129. Smoke control and toxic gas removal: a syner- gistic use of collective protection system. Stanley M. Finger and Richard B. Carey, Naval Ship R&amp;D Center, Annapolis, Maryland; and Virgil F. Keith, E.C.O., Inc., Annapolis, MD. 163</page><page sequence="145">831129-831133 A series of preliminary tests were conducted to determine the potential effectiveness of a collective protection system (CPS) for removing fire-induced smoke and toxic gases on ships of the U.S. Navy. Chemical smoke was introduced into a compartment which was pre-heated to 400°C (752°F) to simulate a shipboard fire. Smoke migration and intensity were then measured under various CPS operating condi- tions. Two additional full-scale tests were subsequently con- ducted, using small quantities of Class A/Class B combusti- bles (5 pounds of shredded cardboard, 2.5 pounds of foam rubber and 2 quarts of marine diesel fuel). The results of these tests indicate that a CPS may be effective in removing smoke and toxic gases from shipboard fires. 831130. The marine worker: safety in the workplace. Alan L. Schneider, Marine Technical and Hazardous Materials Division, U.S. Coast Guard. The United States Coast Guard is the United States' chief maritime safety regulatory authority, and the Marine Tech- nical and Hazardous Materials Division of the Office of Merchant Marine Safety, among other Coast Guard units, is charged with protecting the merchant fleet and merchant marine personnel from harm. In recent years the Coast Guard has become more involved with the harmful effects of ships' atmospheres, including both acute and chronic effects. Unlike shore workers, the marine worker cannot escape his workplace after eight hours, and so occupational problems can be more severe. This paper discusses the work of the Division in several areas of marine worker safety, including asbestos, fire extinguishing gases, cargo vapors, cargo tank atmospheres, noise, radiation, smoke, and hu- man factors. Our goal is to improve the level of safety of the marine worker. 831131. Solid amine C02 removal system for submarine application. Cyrus K. Boynton and Arthur K. Colling, Jr., Hamilton Standard Division. Maintaining the ambient C02 partial pressure as low as practical within available space and power limitations is desirable for the extended submerged operations of modern nuclear submarines. Existing liquid amine systems are de- signed to control C02 partial pressure to a minimum of 0.5 percent. Advanced technology utilizing commercially avail- able solid amine resin is being developed for an improved C02 removal system capable of 0.2% C02 partial pressure. The solid amine is regenerated by heating it with atmo- spheric pressure steam. Amine bed dynamics during the regeneration process allow the C02 to be highly concen- trated. The major components in this system's conceptual design include four beds of solid amine resin, a process air fan, a steam generator for amine regeneration, a condensing heat exchanger, and a C02 compressor. A sequencing con- troller provides continuous system operation by cycling the solid amine beds between C02 absorption and regeneration. Development testing has been performed on a one- tenth scale individual bed system. Both parametric and cy- clic tests have proven the system concept and demonstrated the extended life of the solid amine material. The paper discusses the results and conclusions from development testing and describes the C02 removal system conceptual design and operation. A comparison is given between the solid amine system and existing C02 scrubbers. 1 983 SAE Transactions 831132. Are there limits to man's long-term presence in space? Harold Sandler, Biomedical Research Div., NASA-Ames Research Div., Moffett Field, CA. Manned space flight, now entering its third decade, has been proven to be feasible and endurance has steadily and incrementally increased from hours and days to over six months. None of the physiological changes noted to date has proven detrimental to health. As we now move toward a more permanent presence of man in space, knowledge and understanding of causative factors will become important to assure man's performance capability of tasks which will become more varied and increase in complexity. Psycholog- ical well-being and nature of the proposed habitat must receive important considerations in future overall system design. In order that Space Stations reach their fullest po- tential, they must be open to the greatest segment of the population which may include older aged individuals, fe- males, and individuals with known disease states. Prelimi- nary ground-based simulation studies using these groups have shown no reason for concern, but have been limited to a small number of tested subjects and to periods of study less than six months. Progress will require attention to sub- tle changes as well and use of appropriate animal studies. 831133. Gravitational biology on the space station. J. Ri- chard Keefe, Dept. of Developmental Genetics and Anatomy, CWRU Medical School, Cleve- land, OH; and A. D. Krikorian, Dept. of Bio- chemistry, SUNY, Stony Brook, NY. The development of a permanent space station requires projection of potential applications and opportunities in gravitational biology. Of particular interest is the effect of long-term, multigenerational exposure of various animal and plant species to the environment of near-earth space, with special emphasis upon exposure to chronic null-gravity on morphogenetic processes and on vascular, structural and sensory subsystems. The opportunities for basic research engendered by a biological facility in space will be discussed from the perspective of potential applications of aseptic culture technology. Attention will be drawn to the value of multigenerations of space-reared organisms as a starting point for continuing earth-based research and to the use of this potential for such technological innovations as replace- ment organ generation and production of cell-tissue-organ metabolites. 164</page><page sequence="146">831134-831141 831134. Health care delivery system for long duration manned space operations. James S. Logan, Ellen L. Shulman, and Philip C. Johnson, Medical Sciences Division, NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX. Specific requirements for medical support of a long- duration manned facility in a low earth orbit derive from inflight medical experience, projected medical scenarios, mission related spacecraft and environmental hazards, health maintenance, and preventive medicine. A sequential buildup of medical capabilities tailored to increasing mis- sion complexity is proposed. The space station health main- tenance facility must provide preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic medical support as immediate rescue capability may not exist. 831136. A program in global biology. D. Wayne Mooneyhan, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Space Technology Lab- oratories, Earth Resources Laboratory, NSTL Station, MS. NASA recently initiated a research effort to study the in- fluence of biology on global processes important to life. The program objective is to achieve an understanding of plane- tary biological processes as revealed by the interaction of biota and the environment, with primary focus on global biogeochemical cycling. The study of these complex interrelated processes re- quires an extensive measurement program, advanced data processing systems, and sophisticated model development. Aircraft and satellite remote sensing play an important role along with field and laboratory measurements. Advanced manned and man-tended multisensor satellite systems and multistage sampling techniques will make comprehensive study and understanding possible. 831137. Design and manufacturing of a technology dem- onstration model for a heat rejection system dedi- cated to advanced spacecraft and payload thermal control. Jean Pierre Bouchez, Thermal and Envi- ronmental Section, ESA - ESTEC, Noordwijk, The Netherlands; and Luigi Bussolino, System Engineering - Space Sector, AERITALIA - S.A.I.p.A., Torino, Italy. A Technology Demonstration Model (TDM) of a heat re- jection system dedicated to advanced spacecraft and pay- load thermal control has been manufactured by AERITA- LIA under an European Space Agency (ESA) Contract. After survey and studies, AERITALIA has defined the characteristics and performances of a heat rejection system able to fulfill the requirements of some future spacecraft. The TDM is a model representative of this system in terms of applicable software and hardware and has the main ob- jective of demonstrating the performance and of validating the utilized hardware. The TDM consists of radiator panels (1.85X1.2 m), Spacelab type plumbing, fluid loop servicer with pump package, thermal control valves (by-pass and flow metering) and of an electronic control unit based on a microprocessor. The radiator panels, flow control valves and the control unit have been designed and developed for this application which serves as a prequalification pro- gramme. Their use for flight would require further qualifi- cation testing. This paper gives a brief summary of the basic studies (already described in SAE Technical Paper N.820845-Ref. 1) and is mainly centered on the TDM de- sign and manufacturing processes. 831138. Thermal control of the tethered satellite module. Giorgio Borriello and Giovanni Pellis, AERITA- LIA S.p.A., Sistemi Scientifici ed Applicativi, To- rino, Italy. This paper deals with the thermal design features of the Tethered Satellite Module, according to the project devel- opment status of the advanced Phase B. A description of TSM typical mission characteristics, thermal requirements and constraints and the proposed thermal control design will be given. The thermal analytical models, the subsystem performances and the more representative temperature pre- dictions will be presented with emphasis to special features which may occur. 831139. Microprocessor adaptive control for aircraft ECS. Giorgio Ferla and Vittorio Marchis, Po- litecnico di Torino - Italy. Modern aircraft require always more reliable systems for both crew and passengers safety and comfort. At present new ECS designs are very attractive for their low power consumption even in spite of the more complex structure. The strong changes in the system dy- namics, over the complete working range of the ECS, lower the reliability of the conventional analog control systems, which, due to their own structure, not capable to adapt to different working conditions, have to be designed only with reference to an averaged status. Adaptive controls are digi- tal controls which adapt itself, step by step, to the system dynamics (identified with proper algorithms) and are capa- ble to optimize the controller structure in each system working condition. The present paper shows how adaptive controls, per- formed by microprocessors, can improve the ECS perform- ances especially from the dynamics point of view. 831141. Aircraft de-icing performance analysis by an adapted temperature field analyser program. Uwe G. Hingst, Dornier System GmbH, Friedrich- shafen, Germany. An evaluation of a special thermal mathematical model for anti- or de-icing purposes on airfoils and air inlets of air- crafts is described. The model using finite elements includes heat transfer by conduction, high speed convection for lam- inar or turbulent air flow, evaporation and mass transport. 165</page><page sequence="147">831141 -831147 The thermal mathematical model enables us to vary flight weather conditions, contour geometries, de-icing system details and the flight design cases with the combined turbine engine performance datas. The new mathematical model delivers a detailed matrix of surface temperatures and the running wet back water. The model flexibility will be demonstrated. 831143. Advanced X-ray astrophysics facility thermal control. Carl G. Fritz, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The objectives of the thermal control design were to deter- mine the system performance and system thermal response to satisfy structural components, both scientific and sub- system elements, temperature limits for all vehicle orienta- tions. Thermal control heater power is provided to the observatory to maintain the observatory within its tempera- ture limits for all conditions. The heater power required was analyzed to determine how much heater power, both raw and regulated, had to be supplied. Some selected elec- trical components were studied to determine their tempera- ture. The approach taken was to establish the feasibility of passive thermal control. 831144. The thermal design of the European complement of FSLP. U. Laux, ERNO Raumfahrttechnik GmbH, Bremen, W. Germany. The First Spacelab Mission (FSLP) is a joint ESA/NASA mission and is scheduled to be flown in September 1983. The European complement of FSLP consists of user pro- vided experiments, ESA provided Mission Peculiar Equip- ment (MPE), and Spacelab hardware. The thermal accommodation concept for the European experiments and the design of the thermal MPE is pre- sented. The thermal analysis approach and results will also be discussed. For the thermal design, the use of Spacelab environmental control facilities is maximized. The instru- ments located inside the Spacelab module are thermally controlled entirely by baseline Spacelab facilities. Payload located on the pallet is cooled via a new freon cooling loop layout, which deviates from Spacelab Environ- mental Control System (ECS) baseline and which is deter- mined by specific payload requirements. In addition, the thermal insulation principle of the pallet mounted equipment is introduced. 831145. Steady-state modelling and simulation of the "Technology Demonstration Model" radiator. Ugo Borio, Consultant; Nicola Nervegna, Po- litecnico di Torino; and Ernesto Vallerani, Space Systems Div., AERITALIA SpA - Torino. The present paper details an original investigation based on the attainment of performance predictions of a radiator panel that is in itself a subsystem of the Technology Dem- onstration Model, an advanced heat rejection device con- ceived, and built by AERITALIA SpA under Contract to ESA (European Space Agency). Since at the time of writing this report experimental results were not available, expected correlations and contrasts will form the object of future communications. In this perspective, the feasibility of sim- ulating via computer assisted analysis the aforementioned subsystem is demonstrated; this being achieved by an accu- rate build-up of the mathematical model and subsequent development of appropriate software tools grounded on the finite element method. 831146. High thermal performance requirements, the thermal design and analysis for the German "RÖNTGENSATELLIT". Uwe G. Hingst, Dor- nier System GmbH, Friedrichshafen, Germany. The German X-ray satellite "RÖNTGENSATELLIT" be- longs to a new concept of large astrophysics facilities which includes: • a big four-nested Wolters Telescope • two improved X-ray Detectors and a High Resolu- tion Imager and • a Wide Field Camera. The high optical performance requirements demand lowest thermal distortion properties. Furthermore, the rigid solar generators impose limitations for power availability. The presentation deals with the very demanding image sta- bility requirements and the resulting active heater system, the thermal optical baffle in combination with the high insulation concept. First results will be demonstrated by Phase B analysis. 831147. Analyzer for exhaust plume impingement effects on spacecraft surfaces. H. P. Hafkemeyer, ERNO Raumfahrttechnik GmbH, Bremen, West Germany. For the analysis of nozzle exhaust plume impingement ef- fects on spacecraft surfaces, an analyzer program package was developed. In the geometry section based on the LOHARP- VUFACT routine, the complex spacecraft sufaces are noda- lized. The relative location and orientation of the surface elements with respect to the nozzle exit and plume axis are determined. In the plume flow field section the flow param- eters are determined at the surface element locations based on a point source flow model including nozzle boundary layer effects. In the impingement section, the forces, torques and energy fluxes due to flow impingement are determined and summarized. The analyzer is used to determine the impingement effects of the exhaust plumes of the north/south station keeping hydrazine thrusters on ESA-OTS 2 spacecraft sur- faces. The induced pitch torques are determined among others and are compared with values deduced from flight data assessment. 1983 SAE Transactions 166</page><page sequence="148">831149-831161 831149. A near-term mission for CELSS. Edith A. Gus- tan, Timothy J. Vinopal, and Richard L. Olson, Boeing Aerospace Co., Seattle, WA. Since the beginning of the U.S. space program, it has been postulated that as manned missions became longer and crew size increased, the penalties of storing or routinely resupplying consumables would at some point become pro- hibitively costly. This paper reports on a study that was conducted to determine what missions would benefit from Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) tech- nology. The study focused on manned missions selected from NASA planning forecasts covering the next half cen- tury. Comparison of various life support scenarios for the selected missions and characteristics of projected transpor- tation systems provided data for cost evaluations. This ap- proach identified missions that could benefit from a CELSS, showed the magnitude of potential cost savings, and indicated which system or combination of systems would apply. The paper outlines the analytical approach used in the evaluation, describes the missions and systems considered, and sets forth the benefits derived from CELSS when applicable. 831151. Regenerable non-venting thermal control sub- system for extravehicular activity. George J. Roebelen, Jr., Kenneth J. Dresser, and Edward W. Hodgson, Jr., Hamilton Standard, Division of United Technologies Corp.; and Chin Lin, Na- tional Aeronautics and Space Administration, Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. With the advent of manned spacecraft opportunities requir- ing routine and complex extravehicular activities (EVA) a new concept for heat rejection is mandatory in order to realize maximum crewmember productivity. An optimum extravehicular mobility unit (EMU) thermal control system must be capable of successful operation without requiring expendables and without introducing contaminants into the environment, and be readily regenerable. This paper presents a regenerable non-venting thermal control subsystem requirements specification generated for a Shuttle-related EMU, identifies candidate concepts capa- ble of fulfilling the requirements for each thermal control subsystem application, evaluates each candidate concept with respect to the subsystem requirements, and selects the best approach for each requirement. 831152. The development of an improved suit system for cold water diving. Maxwell W. Lippitt, Jr. and Marshall L. Nuckols, Naval Coastal Systems Center, Panama City, FL. Inadequate protection from cold water severely limits the ability of commercial or military divers to accomplish their missions. This problem has become more evident as ad- vances in life support systems extend dive durations far beyond the capabilities of open-circuit scuba to the point where dives of more than 6 hours can now be accomplished. The Naval Coastal Systems Center (NCSC) has under- taken the development of diver's thermal protection (DTP) equipment intended to meet the requirements of all Navy and Marine Corps diver/swimmer applications. Mission re- quirements of up to 6 hours duration in 35°F (1.7°C) water temperatures were identified as threshold criteria for the design of these thermal protection systems. [A goal of safe operations in 29°F (-1.7°C) water was established.] Maxi- mum commonality for this equipment was sought to mini- mize the equipment inventory to meet the varied require- ments of the combat swimmer, surface tended diver, or saturation diver. Due to the extreme difference in thermal protection required for divers using air and heliox mixtures, a two-part program was established from the outset to satisfy these two needs. 831161. Vehicle regulations in Europe. J. A. Waller, Bed- ford Commercial Vehicles. The paper initially sets the scene by giving a resume of the history of vehicle regulations in Europe. It goes on to ex- plain the differences between the United Nations (U.N.) and Common Market (C.M.) organisations, together with their separate approaches towards the harmonisation of Ve- hicle Construction Regulations in Europe. The inter-relationship of the national legislation of the individual countries to the regulations of the Common Mar- ket and United Nations organisations is explained. The pro- cedures and processes for establishing compliance with the national regulations of the countries of Europe and with the harmonised regulations for vehicles and vehicle systems is contrasted with the American/Canadian self-certification systems. The techniques by which the authorities in Europe also satisfy themselves that conformity is maintained in production are set out. The rule making process for new regulations within the Common Market and United Nations organisations is ex- plained, together with the process by which vehicle manu- facturers are permitted, indeed, are required to comment on and contribute to the formulation in Europe. Reasons for the lack of harmonisation of regulations between the North Americans and Europe are suggested. Whilst the emphasis in Europe on greater control of the environmental type of regulation, is shown to be under- standable under the different living conditions in most Eu- ropean countries compared with those in North America, a means by which greater unanimity could be achieved is suggested. 167</page><page sequence="149">831162-831171 831162. Improved stability and handling of truck combi- nations with the double drawbar dolly. J. H. F. Woodrooffe, National Research Council of Can- ada; J. R. Billing, Ontario Ministry of Transpor- tation and Communications; and R. L. Nisonger, University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. The double drawbar dolly eliminates articulation of the conventional single drawbar converter dolly to improve the stability of multiple trailer truck combinations. It is usually provided with a self-steering axle to improve maneuvera- bility. This paper describes double drawbar dolly types, fac- tors in their design, and findings from tests of a specific dolly and computer simulation results pertaining to a range of dolly concepts. Performance topics investigated include low and high speed offtracking, stability characteristics and loads at the dolly hitch. The results showed vehicle performance is highly de- pendent upon friction and stiffness in the dolly self-steering system. Both test and simulation showed that compared with the single drawbar dolly, a double drawbar dolly hav- ing properties equivalent to that tested would significantly improve vehicle stability. If steer stiffness is diminished to the free castering condition, stability becomes poorer than with the conventional single drawbar dolly. The double drawbar dolly can impose high longitudinal and vertical loads on the pintle hooks. Therefore, the latch mechanism must be capable of resisting these large upward loads. 831163. The influence of size and weight variables on the roll stability of heavy duty trucks. Robert D. Ervin, Transportation Research Institute, The University of Michigan. The roll stability of heavy-duty trucks and truck combina- tions is discussed both on the level of the fundamental me- chanics of vehicle response and from the viewpoint of the quantitative influence of size and weight variables. The presentation on fundamentals begins with the case of a rigidly-suspended vehicle and builds up to the case of a tractor-semitrailer with distinctive suspension stiffnesses and spring lash properties at the various axle positions. Size and weight considerations cover variations in axle load, gross weight, and overall width as well as incidental issues involving the height and possible lateral offset of the pay- load center of gravity. Size and weight influences on roll stability are interpreted in terms of the likely implications for rollover accident involvement. 1983 SAE Transactions 831164. The operation of overlength vehicles - the Sas- katchewan experience. Norman Burns, Road Trans. Branch, Transportation Agency, Sas- katchewan. Since January 30, 1980 general merchandise carriers have received permits to operate vehicles on four lane divided highways in Saskatchewan that exceed the maximum legal length 23 m (75 ft. 5 ins.) specified by regulations. This paper provides an overview of the program and its success to date from a regulators vantage point. It also describes the vehicle configurations that are used, the conditions of per- mit the carriers must comply with and some indication of the efficiencies that are associated with the overlength ve- hicles relative to legal units. 831167. New technology in open pit mining equipment. Jes-Peter Ahrenkiel, O&amp;K Orenstein &amp; Koppel, Aktiengesellschaft. The hydraulic excavator - backhoe and shovel, have gone through several development stages improving the econom- ics. The two basic steps that I wish to discuss are: 1. The development of the hydraulic system. 2. Improvements to the attachment. The hydraulic development has increased the utiliza- tion of the installed power. The geometrical improvements have optimized the digging ability, improving safety and reducing energy consumption. 831168. Advanced design concept on largest diesel- mechanical truck - Komatsu HD1600M. Y. Kato, Product Development and Design Dept., Technical Center, Kawasaki Plant, Komatsu Ltd., Japan. As a direct result of the Mining Industries need to improve efficiency and production in Open Pit type operations, the size of haulage units have increased dramatically. This trend has continued such, that the majority of dump trucks operating in Open Pit operations are in the 170 ton class. Continued mining in existing locations has meant that the increase in vertical lift and resultant grades, and in- creases in hauling distances are making electric drive sys- tems unsuitable. This is largely due to the electric drive systems heat limitations on major propulsion components. With these mining requirements in view and the pre- sent limitations on electric drive systems in mind, Komatsu have been developing the Komatsu HD1600M. A diesel powered mechanical drive dump truck capable of operating in deep pit operations. This presentation introduces: Komatsu HD1600M Dump Truck. 831171. Robotics in hostile environments. Richard W. Hanson, Management Engineering Group, Port- land, OR. The application of Robots in a nuclear environment is a prime example of utilizing modern technology to solve the problems of hostile environments. The robot and its ancil- lary equipment, however, must be able to withstand the decontamination cleansing process, and be capable of oper- ating for maximum periods of time without repair or serv- 168</page><page sequence="150">831171 -831177 ice. To meet these specialized requirements, custom engi- neered components with special materials and parts were required. 831172. Assembly robots. Joe E. Batie, TAK Industrial Corp. Assembly operations are usually the last to be automated. With the advent of robotics technology, automating the assembly operations becomes a very feasible and profit improving area. Automating the assembly process requires a careful look at the desing of the parts to be assembled to enable efficient automated assembly. It is usually best to automated the assembly operation with a modular (step by step) approach. 1983 SAE Transactions 831173. Robotic electronic assembly. Steven C. Baker, Intel Corp.; and Robert E. Reichard, BaGAARD Automation. 60 to 80% of the components on most circuit boards can be auto-inserted by "off-the-shelf' N.C. machinery. The re- maining components typically are of odd size or shape, low volume, or both. Manual assembly is usually required. This paper explores the assembly solution to a compo- nent which did not fit either category. After evaluating component packaging, available equipment, etc., robot as- sembly was chosen as the appropriate method for high vol- ume insertion of 2-pin shorting bars (hereinafter referred to as shunts). 1983 SAE Transactions 831174. Technology impacts on California car and truck fuel demand. Leigh Stamets and Robert Price, California Energy Commission. This paper presents forecasts of future California car and truck fuel demand based on projected economic, demo- graphic, and technologic variables. Vehicle stocks and sales are predicted based on changes of these variables. The pa- per presents several different cases of market-induced, tech- nical fuel economy improvements. Increased fuel efficiency is projected to reduce fuel demand despite growth in income, population, and vehicle miles traveled. Implemen- tation of relatively inexpensive, post- 1985 fuel economy im- provements is forecast to reduce 2002 fuel demand 9 per- cent from 1982 levels, assuming a fuel price escalation rate of 3 percent above inflation. An additional 7 percent reduction appears feasible through refinements in existing technology. 831175. Cold starting tests on a methanol fuelled spark ignition engine. D. P. Gardiner and M. F. Bar- don, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, Ontario. The present cold starting performance of methanol fuelled spark ignition engines is poor compared to their gasoline counterparts. Apparatus has been developed to cold soak a small engine to temperatures as low as -65°C. Tests have been conducted using methanol, Indolene and sample of commercial gasoline of depressed volatility. Data are pro- vided showing the effect of fuel-air ratio on minimum start- ing temperature for the three fuels. Methanol failed to start at temperatures below about 0°C whereas the Indolene started easily to below -45 °C. Reid Vapour Pressure is shown to be ineffective as a predictor of cold starting per- formance for methanol. 831176. Methanol as an alternative automotive fuel: CMC's approach and experience. Peter M. Ash- ton, Garvin McCurdy, and C. F. Osier, Canadian Methanol Canadien (CMC), Winnipeg, Mani- toba. This paper highlights experiences of Canadian Methanol Canadien (CMC) in demonstration of both methanol fuel and methanol-gasoline blends in Winnipeg since 1980 and describes CMC's commercial and technical approach to development of methanol as an alternative automotive fuel. CMC's marketing approach is to equip existing retail serv- ice station outlets with the capability to dispense a full slate of fuels (methanol, methanol containing gasolines, as well as conventional fuels) with fuel blending occurring at the service station location. In this way, the fuel distribution infrastructure can be put in place to service simultaneously both existing vehicles (with a range of methyl gasoline blends) and new methanol fuelled vehicles while assuming a high degree of blended fuel quality in a cost-effective manner. It is concluded that methanol and methanol containing gasolines are excellent transportation fuels for Canada and elsewhere, and can be readily integrated into existing transport fuel retail infrastructure. 831177. Key factors in truck spray control system instal- lation. Edwin F. Schepp, Monsanto Co., St. Louis, MO. This paper highlights the installation requirements for textured spray control flaps fitted to heavy duty trucks. Tractor-trailer combinations operating on wet roads at highway speeds generate visibility impairing spray clouds. A key source of this fine droplet spray formation occurs when high velocity water thrown from truck tires impacts hard surfaces such as fuel tanks or conventional smooth surface flaps. Textured flaps absorb the tread throw impact returning the water to the road surface in large droplets. This paper addresses the placement of the flaps for optimizing spray control efficiency. Special focus is placed on the practical flap fitment behind the tractor steered and drive axles and the rear trailer axle. Moreover, the need for stronger flap support systems is addressed to accommodate 169</page><page sequence="151">831177-831187 the greater snow accumulations characteristic with textured spray control truck flaps. 831178. Heavy truck splash and spray suppression: near and long term solutions. Robert M. Clarke, U.S. Dept. of Transportation, National Highway Traf- fic Safety Administration. Truck splash and spray has been thoroughly researched over the past 20-25 years, but only recently (5-7 years) have concerted efforts been made to develop and market prod- ucts which are both practical in the rugged trucking envi- ronment and yet effective at reducing spray. Achievement of these dual objectives is obviously difficult and involves numerous tradeoffs. This paper describes the mechanisms involved in generating vision obscuring spray and relates them to vehicle design considerations. It describes an as- sortment of vehicle design modifications and component additions which can be made to the present generation of truck designs to materially reduce their spray generation properties. It also outlines points to consider as the next generation of more aerodynamically-shaped, fuel efficient trucks are being designed. 1983 SAE Transactions 831180. Customer satisfaction: the new reality. William W. Lovell, Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. The way consumers look at their cars and the companies that make them has changed, in recent years, as radically as the automobile itself. Increasingly, we treat our cars as long-term investments, and our expectations of quality have risen proportionately with the price of the car. For automobile manufacturers, this shift of attitude has presented a challenge, not just to provide a better prod- uct and better dealer service, but to convince consumers that they stand behind the product should something go wrong. For some, Better Business Bureau mediation/arbi- tration has become a key element of their customer satisfac- tion strategy. 831181. A lightweight two-passenger automobile combin- ing improved crashworthiness, good performance, excellent fuel economy. M. R. Seal, Vehicle Re- search Institute, Western Washington University. The Viking Six Integrated Research Vehicle was designed under contract to the National Highway Traffic Safety Ad- ministration of the Department of Transportation. A pro- gress report published in November 1982 indicated the suc- cessful demonstration of superior fuel economy and performance by the Viking Six without compromising passenger safety. The Viking Six has achieved occupant survival in a 41.2 mph barrier crash, fuel economy of 40.4 mpg city and 66.6 mpg highway and has met 1982 exhaust emission standards. It can accelerate from 0-60 mph in less than nine seconds and shows outstanding stability on cor- ners and in crosswinds. Additional modifications to the Viking Six include exchanging the 1600 cc engine for a 1300 cc engine using hydraulic valve lifters to gain higher com- pression and also the integration of a different engine emission control setup designed to meet the 1983 California Emission Standards. 831182. The design of a three-wheeled, high performance sports/commuter vehicle. David D. Norton, Borg-Warner Corp. The purpose of this paper is to promote the understanding and acceptance of a new family of proposed 3-wheeled sports/commuter vehicles. Thé design of the engineering prototype, the Norton Shrike, is described, and discussion of the dynamic stability aspects and other safety and per- formance aspects of 3-wheeled vehicles is presented. 831185. Transit bus fuel economy research. G. A. Fran- cis, Automotive Program Office, BATTELLE, Columbus Laboratories, Columbus, OH. A new method of comparing the fuel economy of transit buses has been demonstrated. The method is based on SAE J 1321. The SAE test procedure was combined with the Transit Coach Design Operating Profile Duty Cycle from the "White Book" and the test track configuration to pro- duce MPG data for the commuter, arterial, and central business district phases of the duty cycle and MPG data for the combined or overall test cycle. The resulting test proce- dure makes possible the determination of MPG on a wide range of revenue duty cycles and could be useful in calcu- lating life-cycle cost of transit buses. The six 40-foot buses used in this series of tests were produced by six different manufacturers and featured different drive configurations, curb weights, and seating capacities. 831186. Automatic bus diagnostic system at the New York City Transit Authority. Charles J. Redifer, Hamilton Test Systems, Inc., Subsidiary of United Technologies. The Automatic Bus Diagnostic System (ABDS) was tested and evaluated at the New York City Transit Authority in a demonstration program for the Urban Mass Transportation Authority. This paper describes the system and its opera- tion. Specific examples are detailed. Evaluation results and future plans are discussed. 831187. Recent activities of the APTA Bus Technology Liaison Board. Frank J. Cihak and Patrick D. Jones, American Public Transit Association. The American Public Transit Association (APTA) supports the Bus Technology Liaison Board (BTLB) under contract to the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation. The function of the Board is to provide the transit industry's viewpoint and advice in the form of reviews and evaluations of UMTA's bus and paratransit technology projects. Recent activities of the BTLB related to product improvements, 170</page><page sequence="152">831187 - 831196 regulations, and procurement policies in the urban transit bus industry are examined. 831188. Engineering for optimal logging. Tom Maness, Weyerhaeuser Co. Problems and opportunities with attaining optimality in the logging industry is discussed. The economic strategies of minimizing costs and maximizing revenues are compared and contrasted in terms of how these strategies satisfy the constraints of optimal logging. Also discussed is engineer- ing research and how it can be used to move the industry toward optimality in both the short-term and long-term. 831189. An engineering approach to log sorting. Alex W. J. Sinclair, Forest Engineering Research Institute of Canada. This paper is a general description of the process of sorting of logs on land on the coast of B.C. It was prepared for the 1983 SAE West Coast International Meeting to describe one phase of B.C.'s most important industry, the forest products industry. It also illustrates how engineering train- ing is used in all phases of a dryland sortyard from initial site selection through to design and operation. 831190. Log transport West Coast off-highway. Gwynn S. Jenkins, Pacific Truck and Trailer Ltd. The application of off-highway logging trucks to adverse grade hauling has been, and will continue to be, a challenge that the logger must face as he seeks to extract timber from inaccessible areas of the forest. Procedures for analysing drive train life expectancy and the practical aspects of trip time, etc. have been long and involved. The use of computer functions can simplify the decision-making process. 831192. JETFOIL - the wave of the future. Richard T. Crowley and Charles S. Coffey, Boeing Marine Systems. JETFOIL is presented as a hydrofoil with unique capabili- ties operating world-wide, year-around as a high speed transportation system. A brief historical summary of the JETFOIL program is discussed as well as where the hydro- foils are in-service and the achievement of high fleet relia- bility. The configuration features of Boeing hydrofoils such as foil arrangement, automatic control, gas turbines and waterjet propulsion are discussed as they affect the specific hydrofoil attributes of speed, ride comfort and agility. Pre- sent and future JETFOIL applications in the role of re- source protection, offshore transportation, and naval coastal patrol are also presented. 831193. One-atmosphere subsea transfer systems. Les Suchy, CanOcean Resources Ltd., New Westmin- ster, B.C., Canada. This paper describes methods of transporting personnel, under normal atmospheric conditions, from the surface to dry, one-atmosphere hydrocarbon production chambers. It begins with a discussion of the state of the art of various transfer systems, both existing and conceptual; defines transfer system requirements in light of the typical range of subsea tasks; and concludes with an evaluation of the vari- ous design options. 831194. Hearing mechanisms and the effects of noise on man. Richard Patrick Gannon, Hearing Branch, Workers' Compensation Board, Richmond, B.C. The human hearing apparatus has evolved into an efficient mechanism for the reception of airborne sound. Its fre- quency response is tuned quite precisely to the sound of the human voice. Exposure to prolonged and excessive noise is known to damage and destroy the sensory hair cells in the inner ear causing a permanent and quite characteristic hear- ing loss. Other direct effects of noise on the human body have not been substantiated by experimental evidence. Physiological changes may occur but the effects of these on the body are not fully understood. Work performance may be degraded depending on the task and the character of the noise. Hearing loss from noise is an entirely preventable occupational disease. 831195. Effects of noise and personal hearing protection on hearing. David Y. Chung, Workers' Compen- sation Board, Richmond, B.C. Since high noise exposure causes various physiological changes in the cochlea it is not surprising that many psy- choacoustical changes also manifest themselves in people with hearing loss due to noise damage. Some of these psy- choacoustical changes of the auditory system, such as tem- porary threshold shift, permanent threshold shift, speech perception, frequency resolution, and temporal integration are discussed in lay terms. The strategy to be used in noisy industries to reduce noise exposure of workers is also dis- cussed with special attention to the use of personal hearing protection. The use of hearing protectors has different ef- fects on people with different degrees of hearing loss. This paper also relates the effect of hearing protectors to some of the psychoacoustical changes due to noise damage. 831196. (SP-548) Comparative studies of methane and propane as fuels for spark ignition and compres- sion ignition engines. G. A. Karim and I. Wierz- ba, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, The Uni- versity of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The paper reviews the combustion characteristics of the two fuels and sets out to consider their respective performance in both spark ignition and compression ignition engines. Results of comparative tests involving spark ignition en- gines over a wide range of operating conditions are pre- sented and discussed. Some of the performance character- istics considered are those relating to power output, efficiency, tendency to knock, cyclic variations, optimum spark requirements and exhaust emissions. 171</page><page sequence="153">831196-831203 Similarly, some of the performance characteristics in compression ignition engines considered include power output, efficiency, tendency towards knock and autoigni- tion, exhaust emissions and low operational temperature problems. Finally, the relative operational safety aspects of the two fuels are evaluated. It is then suggested that in this regard, methane has some excellent physical, chemical and combustion characteristics that makes it a particularly safe fuel. 1983 SAE Transactions 831197. (SP-548) Development of a system for methane operation in a four cylinder light duty diesel en- gine. Jeffrey L. Vickers, Vehicle Research Insti- tute, Western Washington Univ. A light duty Japanese diesel pickup and a light duty turbo- charged German diesel in a lightweight two seat experimen- tal car were converted to natural gas operation. The gaseous fuel was inducted through various experimental carburetors mounted in the air manifold system. Ignition was effected with pilot oil. Various gas metering valves and linkage to the pilot oil system were tested. Power and fuel economy were measured. 831198. (SP-548) Propane/methane development pro- gram. Michael R. Seal, Mark Leatham, and Pamela S. Jackson, Vehicle Research Institute, Western Washington Univ. Propane is used to extend the range of a methane-fueled car in this project. A feedback loop system for mixture control allows the use of propane or methane or any proportion of the two gases. A refuelling system for propane was devised that allows a refill from a low pressure propane source or a high pressure methane source. 831199. Truck engine charge air cooling - experience, trends and developments. Per-Sune Berg and Sören Udd, Volvo Truck Corp. Experience from nearly six years in production of air-to-air (A-A) charge air cooling (CAC) is reported. Solutions to overcome the drawbacks of air-to-air compared to water-to- air charge air cooling are presented. 831200. Assessing product reliability from warranty data. R. W. Schneider and D. R. Tibbetts, Cummins Engine Co. Warranty data can be a useful, accurate, and timely infor- mation source for monitoring the reliability of a product. At Cummins Engine Company a warranty based reliability information system was developed for diesel engines that has the capability to 1) evaluate the reliability of engines and their components, 2) compare the reliability perform- ance of engines and components to goals and prioritize those areas needing improvement, and 3) detect changes in the warranty claims pattern of engine components to pro- vide early warning of potential problems. This paper will describe this warranty data system with emphasis on the analytical tools used to perform the above activities. Although many of the examples refer to diesel engines, the general concepts apply to the use of warranty data for many types of products. 831201. Caterpillar 3406B Truck Engine. D. H. Connor and R. A. Stapf, Engine Division Engineering, Caterpillar Tractor Co. A new configuration 3406 heavy-duty diesel Truck Engine, designated the 3406B, has been developed. The in-line 6-cy linder engine covers the power range of 255-400 hp (190-298 kW) at rated speeds from 1600-2100 rpm. A pri- mary objective of the development program was to provide continued improvement in fuel economy. Emphasis was placed on development of combustion components and systems that could meet both current and future gaseous and noise emission levels. A new fuel system was one of the key elements in meeting the objectives. This paper deals with the design, development and performance aspects of the 3406B Engine. 831202. Series 92 fuel economy improvements. Brian S. Henriksen, Detroit Diesel Allison Division, Gen- eral Motors Corporation. The Detroit Diesel Allison Series 92 two-stroke cycle diesel engines have undergone a number of changes within the past five years aimed at improving fuel economy and reduc- ing gaseous emissions. These changes include the use of aftercoolers, higher efficiency turbochargers, reduced area intake ports, camshafts for increased expansion stroke, low friction cylinder kits and bypass blowers. Fuel economy has improved approximately 14%. Future changes to lower en- gine speeds, increase the blower bypass area, improve com- bustion efficiency, utilize advanced charge air cooling, re- duce mechanical friction, increase turbocharger efficiency, and incorporate electronics will improve fuel economy fur- ther. This paper describes the changes the Series 92 has undergone and the changes planned for the future to further improve fuel economy. 831203. Coordination of truck drivetrains to minimize fuel consumption. K. Schubert, M.A.N. Significant fuel savings can be achieved by deliberate design measures on the drive line of commercial vehicles. This paper describes some of the results gained by M*A*N in the course of drive line optimization. First the engine and its accessories will be dealt with. Taking a turbocharged and a naturally aspirated engine as examples, three development steps are explained for each of these versions, and their effects on fuel consumption dis- cussed. Then follows a consideration of the savings poten- tial still possible through optimized design of engine ac- cessories. 172</page><page sequence="154">831203 - 831208 Transmission design and the selection of suitable rear axle ratios for heavy commercial vehicles is also considered. Finally the results of tests to determine the effect on fuel consumption of drive line optimization are discussed. Tests with heavy long-haul road trains with various drive line configurations are considered, then the possibility of influencing fuel consumption on city buses by drive line optimization are investigated. 831204. (SP-548) The effects of an iron based fuel cata- lyst upon diesel fleet operation. J. B. Parsons, Finning Tractor &amp; Equipment Co. Ltd.; and G. J. Germane, Brigham Young Univ. This paper will discuss several aspects of fuel combustion in internal combustion engines. It will be shown that one area of significant potential cost reduction for the operator of a major diesel fleet could involve the application of a chemi- cal fuel catalyst to improve the combustion of the diesel fuel. It will be shown that substantial reduction in engine deposits and increased fuel economy on a long term fleet basis have resulted from the use of the catalyst in several large fleets operating in Western Canada. 831205. (SP-548) Fuel stability and storage life of middle distillate fuels. J. R. Bentley and H.-U. Schell- hase, B.C. Hydro R&amp;D Centre, Surrey, B.C. B.C. Hydro is concerned about the long term storage stabil- ity of middle distillate fuels. In the first half of 1982 an extensive literature survey was initiated and various experimental approaches were evaluated. Our laboratory followed other investigators in the field. Fuel quality after aging for 12 weeks at 110°F was selected as an accelerated test for the assessment of fuel storage life. Thermal aging for 16 hours at 212°F was adopted for fast fuel screening, and the moré severe condi- tions of 212°F for 60 to 120 hours for the testing of highly stable fuels and additives. A total of seven test fuels were tested under various conditions. Eight fuel additives were tested, and of these - three additives (so called combination additives) were found to be most effective in controlling thermal aging of ("Keogh") fuel. Initial results of ultrasound aided thermal aging at 110°F seem to indicate that the so called "induction pe- riod" is accompanied by poor aging statistics. 1983 SAE Transactions 831206. (SP-548) Tar sands derived fuels tested in an air cooled high speed diesel. G. D. Webster, S. J. Chiappetta, and J. Ho, National Defence, Can- ada, Defence Research Establishment Ottawa. Three blended fuels with varied levels of tar sands compo- nents considered to be representative of future Canadian diesel fuel were tested and compared with a reference fuel in a single cylinder Deutz air-cooled high speed diesel engine. High output tests were performed with 30°C and 5°C com- bustion and cooling air temperatures. In addition, a rated output test was performed at the 30°C temperature. Engine performance characteristics and combustion parameters were evaluated for all fuels. The effects of the fuels on injection behaviour were also studied. It was found that performance at the test temperatures was acceptable but further evaluation at lower temperatures is required. Slightly advanced injection timing was observed for the denser fuels. Fuels with higher concentrations of aromatics and lower cetane numbers exhibited longer igni- tion delays, higher cylinder pressures, higher rates of pressure rise and lower thermal efficiencies. 831207. (SP-548) Canadian alternative fuels tested in a Bombardier medium speed diesel. Denny Y. Chan, Bombardier Inc., Rail and Diesel Products Div., Engine R&amp;D, Montreal, Quebec; R. G. Grimsey and R. T. Stoneman, National Defence Canada, Directorate of Maritime Engineering Support; and G. D. Webster, National Defence Canada, Defence Research Establishment Ot- tawa. A Bombardier 12 cylinder, 3000 HP medium speed diesel was tested on a straight run reference fuel, a high end point #2 diesel and two Canadian tar sands derived fuels of varying aromaticity. Higher aromatics levels caused in- creases for ignition delay, rates of maximum cylinder pressure rise at lower speeds, maximum cylinder pressure, specific fuel consumptions and the emissions CO, NOx. Despite these increases no engine operational difficulties were encountered but additional testing for longer periods particularly idling tests are recommended. 831208. The past and future benefits of automobile in- spection and maintenance programs. Kay H. Jones and James F. Walsh, Roy F. Weston, Inc., West Chester, PA. The historical and predicted benefits associated with exist- ing and imminent inspection and maintenance programs are investigated. Air quality trends analyses involving three techniques: paired city comparisons, time series analyses, and population exposure modeling are presented which quantify the benefits of I/M programs on Carbon Monox- ide (CO) air quality. Except for the New Jersey program, the authors con- clude that there is little air quality related evidence to sup- port the contention that I/M programs are contributing to improving air quality CO levels. In addition, future ambient trend data are even more unlikely to show any significant CO reduction trends due to I/M programs currently being 173</page><page sequence="155">831208-831218 implemented. 1983 SAE Transactions 831209. Short test results on 1980 and 1981 passenger cars from the Arizona Inspection and Mainte- nance Program. T. L. Darlington, R. W. Craw- ford, and M. A. Sashihara, Energy and Environ- mental Analysis, Inc. This paper presents the results of a study which examined short test results and repair data on 1980 (GM vehicles only) and 1981 (all makes) model year passenger cars par- ticipating in the Arizona Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) program. The primary purpose of the study was to gather information on the failure rates of these vehicles using the Arizona short test, their mean emission levels, and the types of repairs performed on the failing cars. A unique part of the study was that a generalized software system was developed to extract very specific emission con- trol information from the vehicle identification numbers (VIN's) for these vehicles. The results of the study indicate that in general these vehicles have quite low failure rates in comparison with pre- 19 80 vehicles, and that certain ve- hicles have a higher probability of failing the short test than others. The results also indicate that 80-90% of the failed vehicles are successfully repaired by service personnel, and that the average I/M repair cost for 1981 vehicles when free (warranty) repairs are not included is around $38. 831210. Assessment of emission reduction strategies for heavy duty gasoline powered trucks. Rob Klausmeier, Radian Corp. As exhaust emissions from light duty vehicles in the New York Metropolitan Area are reduced, heavy duty gasoline powered trucks (HDGT's) will be responsible for an in- creasing percentage of the overall carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions. In this study, Radian evaluated the effectiveness and feasibility of the following strategies to reduce emissions from HDGT's. 1) The retrofit of emission control devices, such as catalytic converters, onto used (in-use) gasoline powered trucks. 2) Inspec- tion/maintenance (I/M) 3) Mandatory maintenance (M/M) - The requirement that all vehicles be maintained at some time or mileage interval. The study found several problems with the retrofit of catalytic converters that may not be resolved strictly by adherence to good engineering practices. However, I/M and M/M appear to be promising strategies to reduce emission from HDGT's. 1983 SAE Transactions 831211. Environment Canada's approach to emissions in- spection for in-use motor vehicles. David Gour- ley, Environment Canada. Demonstration inspection and maintenance programs in major cities across Canada have indicated that the full ef- fectiveness of emission control equipment installed on new cars is not being achieved as a result of improper vehicle maintenance or tampering with the control devices. Envi- ronment Canada has recognized this phenomena as being both a technical and a social problem. In order to implement an effective solution while avoiding negative public response, a different type of pro- gram is proposed in which the mandatory annual inspection will apply initially to new vehicles only such that the fleet subject to inspection and maintenance will be "phased-in" gradually. The methodology of such an approach is explained in this paper. 831212. Structure and results of Colorado's I/M (AIR) Program. Jerry Gallagher, Mobile Sources Pro- gram, Air Pollution Control Div., Colorado Dept. of Health. The AIR Program has been in full operation in the Front Range counties of Colorado since January 1, 1982. Data from the first 477,905 vehicles tested indicate an average reduction in idle tailpipe carbon monoxide (CO) concentra- tion for retested vehicles of 56%, while the reduction for hydrocarbons (HC) averages 42%. This represents a reduc- tion of approximately 151 tons of CO per day. The average cost of adjustments for 1968 to 1980 vehicles has been $9.23 and the average repair cost for 1981 and newer vehicles has been $22.30. 1983 SAE Transactions 831213. The California approach to vehicle inspection/maintenance. Jonn R. Wallauch, State of California, Dept. of Consumer Affairs, Bureau of Automotive Repair. Though primarily decentralized, California has proposed a biennial Inspection/Maintenance Program that is a hybrid of the decentralized and centralized concepts of vehicular pollution inspections. Private repair garages will volunteer to become licensed by the State in order to conduct inspec- tions and repairs. This novel approach greatly enhances motorist convenience but also results in lesser inspection and repair accuracy than seen in the typical centralized approach. Several features have been built into the proposed pro- gram that protect the motorist and minimize decisions on the part of the mechanic. Equipment and quality assurance measures are comparable to those typically found in a cen- tralized approach. The major features of the program will be discussed in this paper. 831218. A new concept on very high performance mobile power. Huan-Chang Hsieh, Beijing Institute of Technology; and Hong-Yi Zhang and Tao Bai, Harbin Shipbuilding Engineering Institute. A turbocompound engine cycle turbocharged with very high pressure ratio up to 10 and equipped with a comple- mentary combustor and a bypass duct for compressed air is proposed. This paper is to present computer predictions on 174</page><page sequence="156">831218-831261 the real working processes, the performance characteristics, the capability of power boosting, and the optimums of pa- rameters for the proposed cycle. Computer prediction dis- covered that the proposed cycle gives surprising attractive performances for mobile power and that a power boosting as high as 200 - 300% will be attained at comparative better fuel consumption without significant increase in thermal and mechanical load of the engine. 831219. Silicon carbide components for diesel engine ap- plications. Roger S. Storm, James W. MacBeth, and Gregory Flynn, Jr., The Carborundum Co. Diesel engine technology has progressed through various design and materials improvements as previously have other engine concepts. Present diesel engines exhibit excel- lent fuel economy and reliability, having increased in popu- larity for automotive transportation and encouraged new developments in aircraft diesels. Further developments are now on the horizon for ad- vances in higher temperature operation, low friction poten- tial, and extended durability through the use of ceramics in key component hardware. In the present paper the authors, on the basis of past and present experience, discuss applications for silicon car- bide components and the relevance of associated develop- ments in joining technology and non-destructive evaluation. 831221. Development of self-contained hydraulic valve lifter. Akiyoshi Sugiura, Katsujiro Sato, and Ka- zuharu Yamada, Toyota Motor Corp.; and Fumi- nao Arai, and Hisashi Kodama, Aisin Seiki Co., Ltd. The conventional hydraulic valve lifters, which eliminate the valve clearance adjustment, normally use the pressur- ized engine lubricant for the working fluid. We have devel- oped a quite new type lifter, named "self-contained hy- draulic valve lifter", which possesses the working fluid in itself. Because the new type lifter is independent of the pressurized engine lubricant, it has some advantages, espe- cially that it can be applied to the existing engine using the mechanical valve gear without almost any engine modifica- tions. And we have confirmed that the self-contained hy- draulic valve lifter has good characteristics and reliability and have applied it to the mass production engine (i.e. Toyota 1.3L gasoline engine) for the first time in the world. This paper describes the construction, the character- istics and the reliability of this lifter. 831222. (SP-548) Long-term operation of a turbocharged diesel engine on soybean oil fuel blends. M. Carl Ziemke, Joseph F. Peters, and Bernard Schroer, University of Alabama in Huntsville. It has been known for more than 50 years that some diesel engines could be fueled for short periods with vegetable oils, either neat or with hydrocarbon fuel additives. World over- production of soybean oil is increasing its potential as an economical diesel fuel extender. The subject test program was undertaken to determine long-term effects of this alter- nate fuel on a modern, high-speed diesel engine. The choice of a vegetable oil (soybean oil) as an alter- native diesel engine fuel or fuel extender rather than the other major biomass motor fuel (ethanol) is related to the relative properties of these fuels. The common U.S. vegeta- ble oils are much closer to hydrocarbon (No. 2D) diesel fuel than is ethanol in both cetane rating and volumetric energy content. Unlike ethanol, the vegetable oils can be blended 1:1 with No. 2D fuel to produce engine power and volu- metric fuel consumption levels practically identical to those obtained with 100% No. 2D fuel. However, engine opera- tion and laboratory bench tests demonstrated that some fuel blends were unsatisfactory for continuous use. The reasons for these difficulties were determined and a satisfactory fuel blend was proven through prolonged testing. The results of the soybean oil fuel extender tests are considered to be particularly significant because: • Soybean oil is the principal U.S. grown vegetable oil, representing about 85% of possible current national production. • The total duration of the tests (over 1,000 hours) is the longest known U.S. operation of a single engine on any type of vegetable oil fuel. • Successful operation was obtained under stan- dard engine test conditions without any engine modification or adjustment. • From an economic standpoint, soybean oil is closer to the cost of No. 2D fuel than any common U.S. vegetable oil. 831223. The dimensionless load capacity of a plane, finite, rectangular-pad, slider bearing - an analytical so- lution suitable for small computers. A. £. Cur- zon, Physics Dept., Simon Fraser Univ., Burna- by, B.C., Canada. An analytical solution is given for W, the dimensionless load-capacity of a plane, finite, rectangular-pad, slider bear- ing. This solution is suitable for small computers so that students of tribology can carry out calculations on a realis- tic bearing without having to use a large computer which may not be readily available. The solution described is supe- rior to that obtained by the use of standard numerical meth- ods on Reynolds equation because it is obtained more rap- idly, it needs less computer memory storage space and can be carried out in single precision. 831261. Evaporative engine cooling for fuel economy - 1983. Michael D. Leshner, Vacor, Inc. Automotive engineers have recognized the fuel economy advantage of elevated coolant temperatures for many years. Evaporative engine cooling is a well established technology which maintains the engine coolant at its boiling tempera- ture regardless of operating conditions. By assuring that the coolant entering the engine is at nearly the same tempera- 175</page><page sequence="157">831261 -831268 ture as that leaving the engine, overcooling is avoided. Ex- cellent temperature uniformity is assured throughout the engine, permitting coolant temperatures to be raised with- out raising peak metal temperatures. Evaporative cooling allows engine coolant to boil freely at atmospheric pressure, taking advantage of the inherently high heat transfer rates obtained with boiling and condens- ing. The benefits derived from evaporative cooling are faster warmup, reduced friction, (which contribute toward fuel economy) greater engine durability, and safe, low pressure operation. This paper reviews the history, theory, and prac- tice of vapor cooling in stationary and mobile powerplants. 831262. Measurement of engine air cleaner efficiency us- ing airborne particle size analysis. Charles O. Reinhart and Lloyd E. Weisert, Donaldson Com- pany, Inc., Minneapolis, MN. Dust loading and efficiency characteristics are discussed for a typical heavy duty diesel engine intake air cleaner. The effects of particle size and dust loading on efficiency are described with illustrative data for a typical system. In- strumentation and measurement techniques are explained. 831264. Forged straight bevel gears - an overview. Dale K. Benedict, Engine Components Div., Eaton Corp., Battle Creek, MI. Over the past twenty years a number of companies have developed proprietary processes for forging net shape straight bevel gears. The inherent complexity of bevel gear geometry requires tight process control to forge gears which require no further machining on the teeth. Electrode design, die manufacture, scale control and finish machining are critical areas which require special attention to obtain func- tional gears with integrally forged teeth. Gears with integrally forged teeth have inherent ad- vantages over conventionally manufactured gears. These advantages include improved strength, less raw material, design flexibility and cost savings. Examples of these bene- fits are discussed. 1983 SAE Transactions 831265. Powdered metal gears. Dominic W. Pantano, MERRIMAN - Div. Litton Industrial Products, Inc. The powder metallurgy process for producing gears is one of the most flexible metal working techniques available to- day. By adding elemental powders to the base powdered material, the chemistry can be tailored to achieve mechani- cal properties ranging in strengths from 20,000 P.S.I, to 160,000 P.S.I. The process is capable of producing close tolerance gears in high volume at extremely economical prices. 831266. Computer aided inspection of bevel and hypoid gears. Theodore J. Krenzer, Gleason Works, Rochester, NY; and Richard Knebel, Carl Zeiss Inc., Thorn wood, NY. The latest innovations in coordinate measuring machines and instrumentation have been combined with theoretical gear calculations to provide an objective quantitative me- thod for inspecting bevel and hypoid gears. The measuring machine, its software, the gear software and the measuring procedure are described. Also included is an example of the use of the procedure in the development of a gear set. 1983 SAE Transactions 831267. Block displacement for the construction of a chemical waste isolation barrier. Thomas Bruns- ing, Foster-Miller Associates, Inc. Groundwater supplies throughout the United States are threatened by migration of contaminants from numerous sources including solid, chemical and hazardous waste sites. Complete isolation of these sources and their corresponding high concentration migrating plumes is a major step in mitigating the danger of groundwater contamination and is often a cost-effective step in the cleanup process. The "Block Displacement" technique has been devel- oped for complete isolation of large tracks of contaminated ground. A full-scale demonstration was recently conducted on a 50,000 ft3 block of unconsolidated soil. The technique places an impermeable barrier around and beneath the con- taminated zone. In the process, the ground is physically displaced upward by multiple well injection of a barrier material in a slurry state. Applicability assessment requires a vigorous geotechni- cal investigation including monitoring the propagation of a separation from a single prenotched test well at the planned bottom barrier depth. 831268. Trends which will impact agricultural technology in the next decade. R. G. Cragle, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Predicting the trends which will impact agricultural tech- nology in the next decade is surrounded by a degree of uncertainty. The broad long-term trends of population growth, food demand, developing technology and resource depletion can be predicted. Economic recessions and inter- national crises are less predictable. All of these factors af- fect the generation and adoption of new agricultural tech- nology. Other factors affecting agricultural technology include economics at the farm level, energy availability/cost and the types of crops grown. Computer technology and educated farm managers will have an influence on the adop- tion of still other technology. Taxes, cost of labor, cost of land, demand for agricultural products, electronic sensors and innovativeness in manufacturing and on the farm will all influence agricultural technology and its adoption. It would appear that very large factors in the adoption of new 176</page><page sequence="158">831268-831275 agricultural technology in the next decade will continue to be innovative farm and ranch managers. 831269. Intelligent machines for agriculture in 1990. Gary W. Krutz, Purdue University, West Lafay- ette, IN. During the next ten years the United States will experience a change in farm structure. A smaller number of farms will be producing more food. Both very small and very large farms will increase in numbers. They will change to be more diversified in production, utilize on-farm processing of consumer products, and apply advances in automation. These changes are needed to provide consumers food that is cost and quality competitive in worldwide markets. This paper is intended to instill the reader into becoming aware of the changes in technology, marketing, banking, labor and population interests. These trends will direct new farm mechanization towards intelligent machines capable of doing a multitude of tasks. Advances in vision systems, lasers, speech recognition, and bubble memory will be in- corporated into mechanized robots and controlled traffic systems. In no way is this paper to be construed as a fore- cast because the direction of technology can not be fore- casted. 831270. Introduction of a new family of small high tor- que, low speed motors designed for low horse- power applications. Claude M. Pinson, Poclain Hydraulics, Inc. To match the increasing demand of the market for high torque, low speed motors, Poclain Hydraulics applied its vast experience and know-how to develop a new range of small piston motors to fit the low horsepower applications. The modular concept, the high efficiency and the high pressure capability of this new product, we believe, will contribute to further develop the low speed motor market. 831271. A review of efficient hydraulic circuits in selected underground mining machines. Harry C. Evans, Dynex/Rivett Inc. New hydraulic circuits, providing superior efficiency, have been designed making innovative use of existing and new pumps, motors and controls. Applied in demanding mining applications, these circuits and components also show con- siderable promise for application on other mobile equip- ment. The mining environment dictates three primary design objectives: 1.) Use limited space most efficiently; 2.) Maxi- mize horsepower efficiency; 3.) Assure that varying system horsepower demands are kept within the capability of the prime mover. These same objectives are gaining importance in all mobile applications, as higher energy and manufacturing costs cause equipment designers to strive for lower machine costs and more energy-efficient operation. 831272. A method to compare control losses for various mobile hydraulic systems. K. R. Lonnemo, Sperry Vickers Div., Sperry Corp. This paper describes a method to determine control losses, i.e., losses solely due to regulation of velocity of the load, for various variable pump systems as compared to conven- tional fixed pump-open center, by-pass valve systems. The method is graphically illustrated in load pressure- flow diagrams where the different control losses are shown. Loci of comparative control losses are plotted in the load pressure-flow diagram and if the pressure-flow-time duty cycle is known, the total difference in control energy loss/duty cycle can be computed for a particular machine. This energy loss is then converted to the difference (gain or loss) in fuel consumption and cooling require- ments. Finally, results from test runs with a backhoe-loader and three different operators are shown. 831273. Expanding the Deere family of low-speed high- torque hydraulic motors. J. B. Agness, John Deere Product Engineering Center. The John Deere cam lobe motor introduced two years ago has found primary usage as auxiliary drive systems on har- vesting machines. The performance and reliability have been well received on John Deere combines and forage harvesters and in some OEM applications. The basic family is now being expanded to provide new features and flexibil- ity for the OEM market. The expansion to include fixed as well as steerable mountings, shiftable operation (1, 2 or 3 speeds), greater axle capacity and an optional brake will be described. The challenge of extending motor capability and flexibility while minimizing total number of family compo- nents and maintaining reliability will be addressed. 831274. Energy saving considerations in hydraulic cylin- der design and application. George W. Gross, Seitz Mfg. Co., Inc.; and William C. Pope, J. N. Fauver Co., Inc. A new hydraulic cylinder has been designed and tested which improves the cylinder operating characteristics. This cylinder uses state of the art seals at pressures of up to 5000 psi that reduce friction by 10 to 25 percent and eliminate "stick-slip". Application of this type cylinder can greatly reduce hydraulic system size and cost to the OEM, as well as reduce energy cost to the end user of the equipment. 831275. Mobile equipment efficiency management with Servo Controlled Medium Duty Hydrostatic Transmissions. Walter E. Hull and Gary D. McConeghey, Sundstrand-Hydro Transmission. Medium duty mobile equipment can realize productivity gains through the application of Servo Controlled Hydro- static Transmissions. To achieve these gains, hydrostatic transmissions for medium duty vehicles must possess design 177</page><page sequence="159">831275-831283 features which promote management of driveline efficiency. However, to achieve compatibility with the medium duty vehicle, these transmissions should be designed with the cost, life, and size goals of medium duty in mind. This paper provides definition of the medium duty con- cept as it pertains to hydrostatic transmission application and design. Examples of the potential for productivity en- hancement through the use of medium duty hydrostatic transmissions with integrated servo control are presented. 831276. Particle counting in high water content fluids. Thomas S. Wanke, Director, Fluid Power Insti- tute Milwaukee School of Engineering, Associate Director, Applied Technology Center, Milwau- kee School of Engineering; and Andrew J. Bin- versie and Gerald Matranga, Students, Milwaukee School of Engineering. This paper discusses the testing of various types of High Water Content Fluid (HWCF) for the purposes of: 1) determining their viscosity and specific gravity, 2) determining if solid contaminants in the range of 5 to 60 micrometres could be accurately counted using an automatic particle counter, and 3) developing a procedure for counting solid particles in HWCF's using an automatic particle counter. 831277. From engineer to manager. Bruce A. Hunt, Uni- versity of Chicago. The transition from engineer to manager can be one of the most dramatic career moves an individual makes. This pa- per examines the similarities and differences between the roles of engineer and manager along six dimensions: activi- ties, perceptions, thinking, feeling and learning processes, and performance. Because, in many organizations, becom- ing a manager is the most common path to advancement, it is important to identify the new skills required, the barriers to be overcome, and the satisfactions to be anticipated. The purpose of this paper is to help the individual engineer make an informed judgment about his/her career path, to help the incumbant manager who has already made the choice to understand the changing dynamics of his/her work, and to provide information to the organization so that more effective selection of managers can be made. 831278. Leadership: action not position. Micol R. C. Maughan, Univ. of Northern Iowa. The study of Leadership embraces three main phases: 1) Trait theories, 2) Style theories, and 3) Situational theories. Each of these positions is reviewed in this paper. It is sug- gested that leadership is a process of using skills to analyze each situation to determine the appropriate leadership style. Suggestions are given to help the manager with this analysis to develop better leadership skills. 831279. The role of higher education in technical manage- ment. Robert P. Benzinger, Arizona State Uni- versity. Successful and effective management, leadership and ad- ministration in manufacturing industry requires unique blends of talent, intellect, developmental experience and appropriate educational preparation. None of the prime corporate functions (engineering, manufacturing, sales, fi- nance) should be absent from the resume of any aspirant to policy level management. A university degree is the foundation for entrance to the track toward policy level management. At the under- graduate level, only very narrow programs of study are currently in evidence to serve this interdisciplinary objec- tive. At the graduate level, only partial realization is to be found. Two undergraduate proposals are advanced to re- spond to the need. 831280. Accelerated chromium plate piston ring wear associated with liner pitting. George P. Haynes, Glenn F. Hyde, George W. Sauter, and Thomas E. Thornton, Koppers Company, Inc., Piston Ring &amp; Seal Division. Accelerated wear of chromium plated piston rings by an unidentified wear mechanism has been occasionally ob- served in small bore, high speed diesel engines in the field. This chromium plate wear phenomenon has been success- fully reproduced in laboratory engine tests using chemically pitted cylinder liners with rough surface finishes. This pa- per reviews the laboratory test program which was devel- oped a) to understand and identify the wear mechanism and b) to maintain ring wear life through piston ring modifications. 1983 SAE Transactions 831282. Ring dynamics in a diesel engine and its effect on oil consumption and blowby. Richard Truscott and Tony Reid, Wellworthy Ltd.; and Brian Ruddy, AE Developments Ltd. Measurements of cylinder and inter-ring pressures and top ring axial movement were made on a 4-stroke V8 diesel engine running at full power, in order to understand differ- ences in observed oil consumption and blowby for 5 differ- ent ring and piston combinations. In each case the parame- ters were also calculated using a newly developed computer program which combines the effects of ring lift and twist, inter-ring gas pressures, ring profile and tension and liner finish on ring hydrodynamics and gas flow. Encouraging correlation was shown between measured and predicted results. 1983 SAE Transactions 831283. Heat flow through piston rings and its influence on shape. Albin Mierbach and Gerhard E. Dück, Goetze AG; and Brian A. Newman, Muskegon Piston Ring Co. 178</page><page sequence="160">831283-831290 Apart from its many other functions, the piston ring also has the task of dissipating heat from the piston to the cylin- der wall. This heat flow alters the contact pressure of the piston ring against the cylinder and can result in a lack of effective sealing with extremely high pressure at the ring ends. The work presented in this paper enables the effect of the heat flow on the ring shape as a function of piston ring material and dimensions to be calculated from the tempera- ture difference between piston and cylinder wall and to inte- grate these findings into the manufacturing process, i.e., noncircular shaping. This makes it possible for the first time to produce piston rings that do not have the disadvantages in engine application of the uncontrolled thermal deforma- tion - scuffing marks and leakage at the ring ends. 831284. New device for the measurement of piston fric- tional forces in small engines. Shoichi Furuhama and Shinichi Sasaki, Musashi Institute of Tech- nology, Tokyo. Measurement of piston frictional forces during engine oper- ation is valuable for improved fuel economy engine design. The measurement, however, is not easy work because the frictional forces are small compared with the gas and inertia forces. Several years ago, at the Musashi Institute of Tech- nology, frictional forces were measured with a movable bore with pressure balancing. Recently, the pressure balanc- ing devices have been improved and adapted for small en- gines. The piston frictional forces in a small diesel engine and a gasoline engine have been measured with the new device. The characteristics of the friction forces and the compari- son between engine sizes, gasoline and diesel engines have been clarified and the effect of multigrade oil and friction modifiers have been tested. 1983 SAE Transactions 831285. Reducing frictional losses! Is the investment in development really worthwhile? Paul Tholen, Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG. Reducing direct friction losses between the surfaces of slid- ing engine parts has - in many cases - only little influence on the effective fuel consumption, especially in engines with a high load-factor. Therefore, the higher expenditures in development and production result in a poor cost/benefit- relation. But in quite a lot of cases friction losses can be reduced by shifting the speed- and load-range of the engine. To- gether with optimizing oil flow and viscosity behaviour ad- vantages on behalf of the motor cycle-process as well as of engine behaviour and engine life are reached, thus reducing fuel consumption even further together with better engine performance. Some examples are given and discussed in detail. 831286. The effects of common variations in diesel engine bearings. Pranab K. Das and Susan B. Dancer, John Deere Product Engineering Center. It is now well-known that not only dimensions but also manufacturing tolerances and layouts of oil holes and grooves affect engine bearing performance. The present pa- per will show that some new features of machining and operating conditions can also influence bearing operation. Scratches caused by debris in the oil and the size of the counterbore on cross-drilled main journals can have highly detrimental effects. Results will also show how out-of- roundness and ellipticity affect bearing operation. This in- formation can be vital for designing better engine bearings. 831287. Recent developments in hardfacing alloys for in- ternal combustion engine valves. Geoffrey Goth, TRW Valve Division. New valve hardfacing materials have been developed for use in either gasoline or diesel engines. The objective of reducing and/or eliminating cobalt as a necessary alloy addition has been achieved. Improvements in the method of application to the valve have increased productivity, and decreased quality costs. 1983 SAE Transactions 831288. Gaseous and particulate emissions from a single- cylinder divided-chamber diesel engine. A. C. Al- kidas and R. M. Cole, Engine Research Dept.-GMR. In this study, the effects of engine speed, air-fuel ratio, combustion timing, intake-air temperature, and coolant and oil temperature on exhaust gaseous emissions (nitric oxide, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons) and particulate emissions (particulates, volatiles and smoke) were investi- gated in a single-cylinder, divided-chamber diesel engine. In addition, the trade-off behavior of the pollutants was in- vestigated. To aid in the interpretation of the experimental findings, a single-chamber, single-zone heat release model utilizing experimental main-chamber pressure-time data was employed. The large increase in nitric oxide emission index caused either by increasing the air-fuel ratio or by advancing the combustion timing is attributed to the pro- portionally larger amounts of fuel that burn at near TDC conditions. The increase in hydrocarbon emission index with increasing air-fuel ratio and with retarding combustion timing is believed attributable to the resultant increase in bulk quenching. Particulates and smoke increased with de- creasing engine speed, increasing load, and advancing com- bustion timing. In contrast, the volatile content of particu- lates increased with decreasing load and retarding combustion timing. 1983 SAE Transactions 831290. Trend and origins of particulate and hydrocarbon emission from a direct-injection diesel engine. Makoto Ikegami, Xin-he Li, and Yoshihiro Na- 179</page><page sequence="161">831290-831294 kayama, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Kyoto Uni- versity; and Kei Miwa, Kyoto University of Edu- cation. A systematic study on particulate mass emission from a high-speed direct-injection diesel engine was conducted us- ing a mini-dilution sampling method. Effects of fuel-air equivalence ratio, engine speed, injection timing, and swirl intensity are presented and discussed with special regard to soluble organic fraction (SOF) and hydrocarbons. Results show that these concentrations are greatly affected by igni- tion delay or by temperature level in the engine cylinder. As the sources of SOF and hydrocarbons, local and bulk quenching of the charge, interaction of the fuel spray with the combustion chamber walls, and slow thermal decompo- sition of fuel are considered and discussed. Among them, the significance of the fuel decomposition is pointed out, by separate experiments on a simulated engine by using an in-cylinder gas-sampling technique. The proposed mecha- nism is that at low air temperature, thermal cracking is too slow for the injected fuel to be fully decomposed, resulting in the accumulation of raw and partially cracked fuel. 1983 SAE Transactions 831291. Measurement of soot in a diesel combustion chamber by light extinction method and in- cylinder observation by highspeed shadowgraphy. Kazuo Kontani and Shinichi Gotoh, Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, MITI Japan. An optical measurement named the "transmissive light extinction method" was carried out to investigate soot be- havior in a diesel combustion chamber. First, the theoreti- cal principle was discussed, and some preliminary experi- ments to examine the applicability of the method were performed. The method was applied successfully to the measurement of actual soot density in an experimental en- gine with a facility to observe the inside of the combustion chamber. However, some limitations were noticed in the method, as it was essentially a matter of local measurement. Then a simple but unique optical arrangement was made to enable simultaneous highspeed photographing of shadowgraphs and direct images of the combustion flame. As a result, a total picture of the combustion process, though it was not sufficiently quantitative yet, was ob- tained, including fuel spray, flame and soot behaviors. This total picture explained well the result of the local measure- ment of soot density by the transmissive light extinction method. 1983 SAE Transactions 831292. Photographic studies of diesel combustion in a quiescent combustion chamber. M. Falcus, Liver- pool Polytechnic, England; and E. Clough, N. D. . Whitehouse, and E. Noweli, University of Man- chester, Institute of Science &amp; Technology, Eng- land. An 8.5 inch bore two stroke engine has been modified into a photographic test rig in which pictures of the complete combustion chamber could be taken vertically upwards through a perspex crowned piston, using a high speed cam- era. Tests were carried out using several nozzles of the same total hole area. Two fuelling rates and three different air supply pressures were used. At each test condition thir- teen cycles of fired data were recorded on 16 mm high speed colour film. At the same time synchronised transient cylinder pressure and fuel injection data were recorded us- ing an on-line data acquisition system. Correlation of jet development from photographs with heat release deduced from the cylinder pressure diagrams using a standard single zone technique show differences due to changes in the hole configuration and in air supply pressure, with approximately constant fuel injection rates. 831293. Possibilities to reduce influence of compression ratio on total hydrocarbon emission from a D.I. diesel engine. Wolfgang A. Sprogis, Motoren- Werke Mannheim AG, MWM, Munich Ger- many. The compression ratio of a direct-injection Diesel engine was decreased by steps. The total hydrocarbon emissions and various component stresses were measured. HC emissions rise hyperbolically when compression ratio decreases. The curve can be shifted towards lower CR values by increasing load, charge air pressure or charge air temperature. The measured ignition delays are in every re- spect in significant agreement with the HC emissions, lead- ing to the hypothesis that excessive quantities of the in- jected fuel are deposited on the wall when the compression ratio decreases. If the calculated paths of the whole jet up to the beginning of combustion are put in relation to the HC emissions there result critical ranges for the jet tips beyond which the emissions increase drastically. By that the conditions for reducing the influence of compression ratio can be considered for granted. For exam- ple any possibility to reduce the ignition delays is suitable for decreasing emissions since by that the range of the injec- tion jets diminishes accordingly. Beside the influence of various engine specific parameters, the influences of higher charge air pressure, exhaust gas recirculation, exhaust back pressure and intake throttling were investigated in this pa- per. 831294. The effect of mixing rate, end of injection, and sac volume on hydrocarbon emissions from a D.I. diesel engine. R. C. Yu, T.-W. Kuo, and S. M. Shahed, Cummins Engine Company, Inc.; and T. W. Chang, Xian Jiao-Tung University, China. Some results of a systematic analysis of important sources of hydrocarbon emissions from a direct injection diesel en- gine are presented. The following sources are considered 180</page><page sequence="162">831294-831298 and investigated: (1) local overmixing, (2) poor end of injec- tion, (3) fuel emptying from sac volume. The analysis uses systematic engine experiments and an existing two-dimensional thick evaporating spray model to determine the contribution of various hydrocarbon sources to the total hydrocarbon emissions in the exhaust. The results show that at idle and light load conditions, local overmixing is the major source of hydrocarbon emis- sions. The amount of fuel overmixed is directly controlled by mixing rate, ignition delay, and the lean limit of com- bustion. Mixing rate calculations show that the injection rate shape and nozzle geometry are more important than the physical properties of the fuel in determining the amount of fuel overmixed. The results also show that for a low emission engine using timing advance at light loads for overmixing control, poor end of injection and fuel emptying from the sac volume can be important sources of hydrocarbons. The character- ization of these sources and their effect on fuel evaporation and hydrocarbon emissions are discussed. 1983 SAE Transactions 831295. The effect of mixing intensity and degree of pre- mix on soot formation in backmixed combustor. Kevin L. Hoag, University of Wisconsin- Madison, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Cur- rent Affiliation: Cummins Engine Inc., Colum- bus, Indiana; and David E. Foster, Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison, Dept. of Mechanical Engi- neering. To date there is no universal agreement as to the interaction between fuel type, fuel-air mixture preparation and com- bustion chamber flow characteristics and their effect on soot formation. A propane fueled modified conical back- mixed steady flow reactor was built in which the fuel and air could be mixed together in varying degrees and reacted in at different mixing intensities. The onset of soot and soot loading were determined qualitatively by a photomultiplier focused on the volume inside the reactor. Increasing the degree of premix from a diffusion flame to a distribution of Omax/^avg = 5.0 resulted in increases of 3 to 17 percent of the soot-onset equivalence ratio and decreases in soot loading down to zero. Changes in the mixing intensity from 32.5 sec"1 to 75.7 sec'1 resulted in a change in the soot-onset equivalence ratio from 1.26 to 1.52. Soot loading was found to depend on both the mixing intensity, /3, and the average number of mixes per mean residence time, ß/a. 1983 SAE Transactions 831296.

A new combustion system for a light duty D.I. diesel engine was developed, and a 3.5 ton pay load truck (6.5 ton G.V.W.) equipped with this D.I. diesel engine and this com- bustion system realized good fuel economy and lower ex- haust gas emission. Generally, light duty vehicles have to operate over a wide engine speed range. Therefore applica- tion of a D.I. diesel engine to light duty vehicles is difficult because of combustion tuning requirements over a wide engine speed range. Up to now, most of the diesel engines for light vehicles have been of the I.D.I, type. But the D.I. diesel engine has an evident advantage of lower fuel con- sumption. In these circumstances the authors developed a new combustion chamber shape for a small D.I. diesel engine with turbulence induced intake port and optimum fuel in- jection equipment. Various combustion chamber geometries were tested and evaluated. Flow visualization technique using the oil film method and high speed schlieren photog- raphy of the combustion process were used. A combustion chamber having a special cavity shape which promotes a better mixing with the injected fuel spray was selected. The newly developed model W engine with this combustion system realized better fuel consumption over a wide speed range. 1983 SAE Transactions 831297. An air cell DI diesel engine and its soot emission characteristics. Takeyuki Kamimoto, Shuichi Osako, and Shin Matsuoka, Tokyo Institute of Technology. A DI diesel engine with an air cell was developed as one of the combustion systems for reducing soot emission from diesel engines: The air is accumulated in the air cell during the compression stroke and is injected into the main cham- ber during a period after the end of injection. The air jet stirs the stagnant flame and promotes soot oxidation. A comparative experiment with the conventional sys- tem made it clear that the air-cell system effectively reduces soot emission at a medium and high load condition. 1983 SAE Transactions 831298. Dual fueled diesel engine with diesel fuel and reformed methanol. Koji Korematsu, Takashi Saika, and Masashi Gabe, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Kogakuin University, Tokyo, Japan; and Kunihiko Komiyama, and Koichiro Itow, Engine Technical Center, Komatsu Ltd., Oyama, Japan. A dual fueled diesel engine system with diesel fuel and reformed methanol has been investigated. Methanol can be reformed to reformed methanol (hydrogen 67% + carbon monoxide 33%) over suitable catalyst. The reformed meth- anol contains 20% more energy than methanol. Fundamen- tal data of an electric heated reformer, performance of the dual fueled diesel engine to which hydrogen and carbon monoxide fed from gas bombs as a preliminary experiment, 181</page><page sequence="163">831298-831305 and then performance of the diesel engine with an onboard reformer were tested. In consequence, the feed of the re- formed methanol improves the diesel engine performance. 831299. Cycle simulation of coal particle fueled recipro- cating internal-combustion engines. Kenneth H. Rosegay, Southwest Research Institute; and Je- rald A. Caton, Texas A&amp;M Univ. A cycle simulation has been developed and used to investi- gate the combustion process and performance trends of coal particle fueled, direct-injected diesel engines. Particle reac- tion rates were calculated as a function of crank angle and depended on instantaneous conditions of both the cylinder gas and particles. Assumptions were made that cylinder gas was uniformly mixed and the particles were solid spheres of pure carbon. The results of the study suggest that the particles will not self-ignite in the cylinder, but will burn successfully with use of a pilot ignition. Thermal efficiency was found to be sensitive to the selected initial particle size and the en- gine operating speed. 1983 SAE Transactions 831300. Development of compact, water-cooled engine K2AS. Yoshiaki Sakamoto and Masahiro Yama- guchi, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Mitsubishi has developed the new, compact, water-cooled vertical type 2-cylinder diesel engine model K2AS and brought it to market in spring of *82. The K2AS is a small- sized engine of 451 cc total displacement and 10HP/3600 rpm maximum output. Its weight of 58 kg is light enough to use this diesel engine for various machines which have formerly been driven by gasoline engines. The well matched combustion chamber and injection system realize low fuel consumption, low noise and easy engine starting. High durability is also assured by various kinds of reliability evaluation. 831302. A novel approach to engine torque speed control. D. G. Brown and S. Thompson, The Queen's University of Belfast. This paper describes a novel approach to the design of an engine torque/speed controller. Since all the information necessary to design the controller is obtained directly from a small number of step response tests, the necessity of first producing a control model for the engine is avoided, thus effecting considerable savings in time and effort. Further, although the independent control of an engine's torque and speed is not trivial, the resulting controller has a simple physical structure which makes the device easy to manufac- ture and inexpensive. The method of control and the re- quired design stages are all demonstrated using a Ford 1.1 L CVH engine. 831303. Further tests on reducing fuel consumption with a carburetted two-stroke cycle engine. B. W. Hill and G. P. Blair, Dept. of Mechanical and In- dustrial Engineering, The Queen's University of Belfast, Northern Ireland. This paper describes a unique and uncomplicated method of stratified-charging a two-stroke cycle engine which as- sists in reducing the short-circuited loss of fuel during scavenging. Performance characteristics as presented were acquired from tests conducted on a 400 cm3 naturally aspi- rated, single cylinder, spark ignition two-stroke engine with carburettor control of gasoline fuel, the design and con- struction of the engine also being done at The Queen's University of Belfast. Using a tuned exhaust pipe, the en- gine produces a peak power of 16 kw at 5000 rev/min and has a minimum brake specific fuel consumption of 0.275 kgAWh. Moreover, for the tests presented at full and quar- ter throttle openings, virtually all of the brake specific fuel consumption values are below 0.36 kgAWh. Most of the performance characteristics shown at various engine speeds are as a function of air/fuel ratio. This paper is a continua- tion of that presented as SAE 830093. 1983 SAE Transactions 831304. Advances in traction drive technology. S. H. Loewenthal and D. A. Röhn, National Aero- nautics and Space Administration, Lewis Re- search Center, Cleveland, OH; and N. E. Ander- son, Propulsion Laboratory, AVRADCOM Research and Technology Laboratory, Lewis Re- search Center, Cleveland, OH. Traction drives are among the simplest of all speed chang- ing mechanisms. Although they have been in industrial use for more than 50 years, their operating characteristics and performance capabilities are not widely known. This paper briefly traces their technical evolution from early uses as main transmissions in automobiles at the turn of the cen- tury to modern, high-powered traction drives capable of transmitting hundreds of horsepower. Recent advances in technology are described which enable today's traction drive to be a serious candidate for off-highway vehicles and helicopter applications. Improvements in materials, traction fluids, design techniques, power loss and life prediction methods will be highlighted. Performance characteristics of the Nasvytis fixed-ratio drive are given. Promising future drive applications, such as helicopter main transmissions and servo-control positioning mechanisms are also ad- dressed. 1983 SAE Transactions 831305. A service-life oriented method of rating tractor transmissions and axles. Guenther Buck and Friedrich J. Ehrlinger, Zahnradfabrik Friedrich- shafen AG; and Joel J. Popławski, ZF of North America, Inc. 182</page><page sequence="164">831305-831314 Several highly technical skills are required to design and develop a self-propelled vehicle. One such skill is to design or select the appropriate size drive train. The more accu- rately this can be accomplished, the more significant will be the savings in development cost. Various references are available on the theoretical approach; however, a significant unknown is the relationship to practical applications. Zahn- radfabrik Friedrichshafen AG has over many years of expe- rience developed a computer program that can reliably as- sess the service life of power train designs. The reliability of this approach has been proven by both vehicle manufacturers and end users. 831307. Computer-aided planning, design, estimating and scheduling of earthwork. Carter J. Ward, Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory. A computer-aided technique is being developed for plan- ning, design, estimating, and scheduling of horizontal con- struction for facilities required to support military opera- tions. This technique permits the user to quickly analyze possible sites and identify those which would require the least construction effort. Once the user selects the site for a facility, the system can design the earthwork, quantify esti- mates of each earthmoving function, and generate a con- struction schedule. The user can choose whether the sched- ule is to be equipment constrained or completion time constrained. This paper describes the technique, including discussions of site data acquisition, the procedures used for quantifying earthwork and estimating equipment produc- tivity, and correlations of these with a required task se- quence to generate a construction schedule. 831308. Survivability of bomb damage repair equipment - key to rapid airbase recovery. Edgar F. Alex- ander, USAF; and Wayne J. Christensen, BDM Corp. This paper describes the development and test of compo- nents for the hardening of runway repair construction equipment against threats of fragments from bomblets and bombs. 831309. The need for data base management systems in CAD/CAM. John L. Nordstrom, Applicon, Inc. A CAD/CAM system has the potential to save time and money in two areas. It can perform design and manufactur- ing tasks more quickly, and use its stored information as a starting point for new designs. To efficiently and consist- ently find stored information as a starting point requires a database management system. This paper explains database management systems as opposed to standard file storage, and shows their impor- tance to CAD/CAM systems. 831310. Putting CADD to work. James V. Reimann and Bruce V. Christensen, Clark Equipment Co., Benton Harbor, MI. Computer Aided Drafting and Design brings with it unique considerations that require adjustments in engineering man- agement. Six subject areas, not usually mentioned, are pre- sented in terms of the authors' experience to guide the reader in evaluation, choosing and implementing a system. 831311. CAD/CAM use in numerical control. Rob Neil and Michael D. Nelson, Calma Co., Santa Clara, CA. This paper discusses the benefits of using an interactive graphic system with a powerful high-level graphics lan- guage in the implementation of numerical control. Typical procedural steps are used to illustrate the process through the design, drafting, and manufacturing phases, and to de- pict some of the capabilities of interactive graphic system CAD/CAM software. These include multi-axis contouring, selection of required tools, generation of tool paths, and explanation of associativity, the use of a machining control file, and post processors for particular machines. Because the system shows the piece part in three dimensions, the user can verify the tool paths, tool clearances and mount- ings before cutting instructions are issued. 831312. Effect of commercial oil additives on wet friction systems. Alfred G. Hopkins and John N. Ander- son, Ray mark Corp., Stratford, CT. The effects of ten commercial oil additives on the static and dynamic coefficients of friction of graphitic paper and elastomeric friction materials have been investigated. Addi- tives which function as a friction modifier, detergent, ex- treme pressure agent, antioxidant, viscosity index improver, or dispersant were included in the study. Using stepwise addition of the additives to the base oil in the dynamometer, the changes in static and dynamic coefficients of friction attributable to the additive were determined for a porous, graphitic paper type product and a more dense, but resil- ient, elastomeric friction material. Interactions of the addi- tives in determining the frictional properties of these mate- rials were also investigated. 1983 SAE Transactions 831313. An inexpensive quality assurance friction dyna- mometer. Joseph R. Fox, Thermoset Inc. Confirming the coefficient of friction of production clutch plates has heretofore ranged from difficult to prohibitively expensive for many geometries. This paper describes an approach to the problem of "inspecting" coefficient of fric- tion with a minimum of tooling or capital. 831314. Progress in the development and manufacture of heavy duty paper friction material. R. M. Tuck, R. E. Grambo, R. E. Dowell, and R. S. Frichette, S. K. Wellman Corp. Original paper friction materials were energy limited and their use confined to light duty vehicles. Recent innovations in paper friction material compositions now permit consid- 183</page><page sequence="165">831314-831320 eration of this type of friction facing for all wet friction applications. A comparison of the properties of these new materials with those of traditional paper friction composi- tions, demonstrates the attractive features of the new mate- rials. New friction paper compositions allow the potential user to select desired properties from a wide range of per- formance characteristics. The installation of an automated paper friction clutch disc production line further enhances the reliability and cost-effectiveness of paper friction mate- rials. 1983 SAE Transactions 831315. Electronic fuel level engine control. Warren H. Pagane, Grossman's, Division of Evans Products. This device eliminates problems and component failures resulting from completely depleting fuel supply in an engine fuel supply tank. The control monitors the level of fuel in the supply tank. When the fuel level in the engine's supply tank reaches a predetermined low level, the control will signal operator with an intermittent signal for five minutes after which if the signal is ignored (no fuel added to tank), the control will shut the engine off and disable the starter and ignition system (fuel solenoid). The engine will remain in this condition until a sufficient amount of fuel is added to tank. This takes the monitoring of refueling out of the opera- tor's hands thereby eliminating the need of priming the carburetor or, in Diesel engines, purging the injectors and fuel system. Shutting down prior to emptying tank reduces possibility of picking up sediment or water from the bottom of the tank. 831316. Study of structural behaviour of ventilated brake disc. S. Medonos, Computas Ltd., Great Britain. Evaluation of the most critical stress situations in the venti- lated brake disc due to the three dimensional loading pat- tern requires application of finite element method and mul- tilevel superelement technique. The structural response to the vehicle braking cycle is represented by stress distribu- tions varying with time and with location of the brake pads with respect to the ventilation ducts. Assessment of fatigue life of the disc is carried out using the calculated stresses and stress concentrations. 831317. Extending engine life and reducing maintenance through the use of a mobile oil refîner. Marion E. York, York Refiner Division. The by-pass oil refiner, which removes both solid and liquid contaminants, has shown itself to be very effective in sub- stantially extending the life of an engine. In twelve years of piloting and testing with school bus fleets, this author found the refiner to keep oil cleaner than either a full-flow or diesel by-pass oil filter can and, in doing so, eliminate the necessity of interval oil changes. Its use constitutes a major maintenance change: extended oil use results in a process- ing of oil and engine which can be accomplished in no other way. 831318. Chatter in wet brakes. Terry V. Friesen, Chevron Research Co. The wet brakes used in wheeled tractors often produce noise and vibration on engagement. This vibration, nor- mally termed "chatter," is often attributed to stick-slip. This paper discusses how a negatively sloped friction- velocity curve and/or brake geometry can induce these self- excited vibrations. Methods of measuring brake chatter are also discussed. 1983 SAE Transactions 831319. The vibrometer - A draft load vibrating reed sen- sor. N. M. Stefano, TRW Transportation Electri- cal and Electronics Operations. A small strip of spring steel is integrally mounted in a counterbored hole in a draft bar so that a tension or com- pression load on the bar will change the length and load on the strip, changing its natural frequency. A magnetic circuit is used to (1) disturb the strip, to keep it vibrating, and (2) sense the vibration frequency. The design parameters are explored, and laboratory and field test data are presented. 1983 SAE Transactions 831320. Torsional vibration measurement and analysis: a new technique. Mark S. Henry, Schwitzer Pumps &amp; Dampers. Torsional vibration measurements, while varying in com- plexity, are probably the least familiar type of vibration measurement. The high output demands imposed on to- day's engines require a complete understanding of torsional vibration. This understanding is necessary to insure proper function and durability of these engines and their compo- nents. The need for an accurate, reliable and durable measurement system that could be used for the evaluation of any engine application is essential. The measurement system has two basic components, an engine mounted transducer and signal conditioning/data reduction equip- ment. The transducer must be selected before other system components can be identified or developed. A prototype transducer has been evaluated and proven to meet the above criteria. Its performance has been verified with the use of redundant test methods. This instrumentation in- cluded proximity probes, linear accelerometers, an angular velocity transducer and optical methods. The linearity re- sponse of the transducer was excellent on all the subjected test set-ups. The device responded equally well to either rotating or non-rotating inputs. Eccentric locations of the transducer were shown to have minimal effects on the out- put response. Temperature compensation must be built into the production transducer and accurate readings can be expected from 25°F (-3.8°C) to 250°F (121°C). The future of this device looks very promising and the range of applica- 184</page><page sequence="166">831320-831326 tions extend from torsional testing and machinery diagnosis to continuous systems monitoring. 1983 SAE Transactions 831321. Development of a distributed microcomputer based engine performance evaluation system. Sa- toshi Kuroiwa, Kouichi Tokunaga, Hiroshi Ya- mamoto, and Hiroyuki Ochiai, Toyota Motor Corp. Computer aided systems for performance evaluation of functional devices for passenger cars, such as engines or transmissions, have been applied for ten years. These sys- tems generally consist of a large main frame computer or minicomputers for conducting a large number of compli- cated analyses. In the past, these computer aided systems were used for vehicle research and development since they were too expensive and sophisticated for use on the produc- tion line. Today, microcomputers with mass memory or per- sonal computers are available at very low cost in compari- son to conventional minicomputers. With many distributed microcomputers, we have developed a new test and control system for the engine production line. This system consists of (1) a microcomputer with a disk system for test data storage, (2) five personal computers for the man-machine system and data processing, and (3) microcomputers for real time control and data acquisition. These distributed micro and personal computers have been connected with standard interfaces. With this system we have achieved higher efficiency of inspection such as performance testing, quality control, and higher levels of the test analyses. 831322. A three dimensional finite element analysis of a high speed diesel engine connecting rod. William D. Webster, Jr., GMI Engineering &amp; Manage- ment Institute, Flint, MI; and Roy Coffell and Dave Alfaro, Buick Motor Division, Flint, MI. A high speed diesel engine connecting rod is extensively modeled incorporating three dimensional finite elements and bolt pretension forces. The resulting finite element analysis determines those regions containing high stress va- lues and defines the deformed shapes for various loading conditions. 831323. New considerations in connecting rod design. Brian L. Carlson and James H. Ruff, John Deere Product Engineering Center. Connecting rod design factors such as joint surface flatness, bearing crush, geometric shape, and capscrew torque can significantly affect bore distortion, assembly stresses, and bearing and joint load distribution. Manufacturing varia- tions in joint surface flatness and bearing crush were pre- dicted to have a profound effect upon bore distortion and joint closure. Finite element methods were used to study the effects of these design factors. This analytical approach rep- resents a new, practical, and cost effective means to im- prove connecting rod design. 831324. Diesel engine health: laser diagnostics. N. A. Halliwell, L. Pullen, and J. Baker, Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, The University, Southampton, England. This paper describes two simple laser instruments which the automotive engineer can use in vibrational studies of diesel engines. The first is a 'normal surface velocity' in- strument which the engineer can hand hold and simply 'point' at the target surface for measurement. Field tests have shown it to be quick and easy to use with excellent accuracy and reliability. It is a particular time-saver in test cell use where the necessity for many accelerometer fittings is removed. The second is a laser torsional vibrometer which can measure the torsional oscillation of rotating ma- chinery parts. This has shown itself to be superior to the more standard techniques of slotted discs and slip rings, etc. and provides advantages of higher frequency response, greater accuracy and non-contact measurement. Conclu- sions drawn herald a step forward in measurement tech- niques and demonstrate the great potential of laser technol- ogy in heavy engineering applications. 1983 SAE Transactions 831325. Thermal loading of the cylinder head of a divided-chamber diesel engine. A. C. Alkidas and R. M. Cole, Engine Research Dept.-GMR. Time-averaged combustion chamber surface temperatures and surface heat fluxes were measured at three locations (one in the antechamber and two in the main chamber) on the head of a single-cylinder, divided-chamber diesel en- gine. In general the surface temperature and heat flux were found to increase with increasing engine speed, fuel-air ratio and intake-air temperature, decreasing coolant temperature and advancing combustion timing. At motored conditions the highest heat flux was at the antechamber location. This was caused by the high swirl flows present in the antecham- ber. In contrast, at all other conditions the highest heat flux was measured at the location in the main chamber near the valves. This was attributed to the convective action of the high-temperature stream of combustion gases exiting the antechamber during the expansion stroke. Lastly, the local surface heat flux measurements were correlated in terms of the air and fuel consumption rates of the engine. 831326. Development of a durable, reliable and fast re- sponding solenoid valve. R. L. Barkhimer, N. J. Beck, and W. E. Weseloh, BKM, Inc., San Diego, CA. A new solenoid operated valve has been developed which is compact, durable, reliable and fast operating. Different ver- sions of the valve have been constructed for operating pressures of 2 bar to 100 bar. The valving mechanism is ball poppet and requires no spring. Additional design features 185</page><page sequence="167">831326-831331 include hardened seats, and close control of valve travel and air gap. 831327. Proportional valves - requirements and demands. H. J. Jacobsen, J. C. Hansen, and A. Maletzki, Danfoss A/S, Nordborg, Denmark. Proportional valves is a comprehensive term. We shall here exclusively deal with the load indepen- dent proportional directional valves, applicable on mobile, maritime and stationary equipment. Proportional directional valves are used when it is re- quired to improve a given machine or system in relation to one or more of the following eight items: - Increased Operator Comfort - Improved Productivity - Greater Safety - Reduced Energy Consumption - Higher Flexibility - Lower System Price - Better Control Properties - Higher Degree of Automation The very great and obvious advantage by using the aforementioned valves will be the possibility of remote con- trol of the manoeuvring, e.g. electrically. The paper will discuss the above mentioned items in detail. 831328. Electrohydraulic system response - nonlinear vs linear. G. M. Lance, The University of Iowa, College of Engineering; and A. T. Kleaveland, General Electric Co., Industrial Electronics Busi- ness Group. The results from an investigation of some of the effects of using a linearized model for prediction of the behavior of a nonlinear system are presented. The system studied is a velocity system using an electrohydraulic servoactuator to drive an inertial load. Both nonlinear and linearized system models are defined. The result of defining optimal feedback values for an integral quadratic performance index is shown along with the effect of choice of nominal operating point on the linearized system transient response. Finally, linear and nonlinear transient responses are compared for a range of step amplitudes. 831329. Experiments on cylinder pressure pulsation and distribution in a swirl-chamber-type automotive diesel engine: idling knocking noise induced by non-uniformly distributed cylinder pressure pul- sation. Hideo Okamura, Sophia Univ.; and Ma- nabu Furubayashi, Isuzu Motors Ltd. The generation mechanism of the knocking-like, character- istic engine noise in a swirl-chamber-type, automotive en- gine was investigated. This characteristic engine noise was particularly domi- nant in cold weather and at idling conditions. It was found that in cold weather, cylinder pressure pulsations of significant amplitude can be induced in the main chamber by the cavity resonance of the swirl chamber and throat, but the pulsations distribute non-uniformly on the piston top surfaces. Collisions between the pistons and the cylinder liners were induced by the pulsating, non-uniformly distributed cylinder pressure, therefore engine structure noise was gen- erated. 831330. Identification of internal noise sources in diesel engines. Yoichiro Yawata, Engine Technical Center, Komatsu Ltd., Japan; and Malcolm J. Crocker, Ray W. Herrick Laboratories, School of Mechanical Engrg., Purdue Univ., Current Affili- ation: Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Auburn Univ. In order to identify noise sources in a diesel engine, specifi- cally exciting forces such as combustion and piston slap, the so-called coherence method which utilizes relationships be- tween the auto and cross spectra of cylinder pressure, cylinder liner acceleration and engine noise has been exam- ined. Also, as an alternative, a multivariable regression analysis in one-third octave band auto spectra of each signal mentioned above has been made. It was shown that the simple coherence model studied does not seem useful for this particular type of noise source identification problem. However, the multivariable regres- sion approach has yielded fairly reasonable results, though some problems have been found in accuracy. From this research, it was found that combustion noise is predominant for heavier engine load conditions, though at lower load and high speed conditions, piston slap noise becomes appreciable. 831331. Determination of the sound transmission rate of diesel engines by means of cyclic fluctuations. Karl Schmillen, Forschungsgesellschaft für Ener- gietechnik und Verbrennungsmotoren, Aachen; Albert Flotho, Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG, Koln; and Wolfgang Schlünder, Lehrstuhl für Angewandte Thermodynamik, RWTH Aachen. The pressure time history in the combustion chamber of an IC-engine is seen as a sound phenomenon which - attenu- ated by the engine structure - is radiated as combustion noise. A distinction has been made between the direct and indirect combustion noise. The subject "transmission rate/direct combustion noise" has been investigated by the example of an air-cooled single cylinder diesel engine. To this end short-range noise intensity measurements as well as cylinder pressure measurements at several points in the combustion chamber have been carried out simultaneously. The evaluation method chosen considers the considerable cyclic fluctuations from working cycle to working cycle of the cylinder pressure level to check the applicability of a 186</page><page sequence="168">831331-831337 transmission rate. Within a frequency range of 0.5 to 9.5 kHz the correlation coefficients of sound intensities and cyl- inder pressure excitation have been determined in 500 Hz band-width for 50 successive working cycles. The results of the investigation can be used for evaluation of the acoustic properties of the combustion process. 1983 SAE Transactions 831332. Computation of radiation heat transfer in diesel combustion. S. L. Chang and K. T. Rhee, Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engrg., Rutgers Univ. A theoretical model of radiation heat transfer has been developed. A computation of radiation heat flux at a partic- ular location in the combustion chamber by using the pre- sent model requires in-cylinder time- and space-resolved species data and cylinder pressure. From the species data, the burned fuel/air ratio distribution is inferred to compute space-resolved adiabatic flame temperature. For the com- putation of the spectral emissivity of an isothermal volume of adiabatic temperature containing soot, the Rayleigh-limit expression is used. The refraction indices in the expression are obtained by using the dispersion equations based on the electronic theory encompassing both free and bound elec- trons. For the spectral emissivity from the gaseous compo- nent in the volume, the semi-empirical band model is used. A parametric analysis of radiation heat transfer in diesel combustion is made by using the present model; a predic- tion by the model qualitatively compares with some of the reported experimental data. 1983 SAE Transactions 831333. Influence on particles in diluted diesel engine exhaust gas. Stefan Reichel and Franz F. Pisch- inger, Institute of Applied Thermodynamics Technical University, Aachen, West Germany; and Gerhard Lepperhoff, FEV-Research Insti- tute, Aachen, West Germany. This paper presents the results of experimental and theo- retical investigations on measuring particulate emissions of diesel engines in a dilution tunnel. The results offer a contri- bution to understanding the influence of several parameters on the particle phase of exhaust gas when diluted and mixed with air. These parameters include the exhaust gas temperature, the dilution ratio of the exhaust gas in the air, the mixture temperature, the flow and mixture conditions, the amount of filter loading and the filter material. In order to determine which physical/chemical processes dominate particle formation in diluted exhaust gas, the results of calculations in terms of condensation and adsorption are compared with the experimental findings. An increase in measured particulate concentrations is generally favoured by short sampling times, fast mixing processes, high ex- haust gas temperatures, low mixture temperatures and low dilution ratios. Furthermore, the results show that adsorp- tion of hydrocarbons to soot particles rather than condensa- tion is the major influence on particulate formation. 1983 SAE Transactions 831335. Cold startability of open-chamber direct- injection diesel engines - part 1: measurement technique and effects of compression ratio. Ramkrishna Phatak, Southwest Research Insti- tute; and Tadao Nakamura, Komatsu, Ltd. A cold startability study was carried out on a single- cylinder research engine. Engine cooling was achieved by circulating chilled alcohol through the engine. Cold air was supplied with the help of compressed air and vortex tubes. A technique was developed to measure white smoke output of the engine. Charge air temperatures for a non-firing en- gine were measured by using thermocouples and high-speed data acquisition techniques. High-speed data acquisition techniques were used for quantitative determination of cold startability by comparing cranking torque, black smoke, white smoke, and cylinder pressure. Cold startability was measured for compression ratios of 14:1, 16:1 and 18:1 at 32°F, 14°F, and -4°F. The study indicated desirability of lower compression ratios for performance and higher compression ratios, higher cranking speeds and retarded injection timings for improved cold startability. 1983 SAE Transactions 831336. Effects of relative combustion chamber diameter on performance and cylinder head thermal load- ing of open type combustion chamber diesel en- gines. A. S. Khatchian, Moscow Technical Uni- versity of Automobile Maintenance and Highway Construction. Multi-channel relations between relative combustion cham- ber diameter (dc.ch/D) and open type combustion chamber diesel engine parameters are analysed. Special attention is paid to optimising diesel engine design in case of wide com- bustion chamber to get highest efficiency. It is shown that choice of fuel injection equipment may play important part to solve the problem. Results of experimental investigations of cylinder head thermal loading in case of different dc.ch/D values are presented. Attempt is made to establish reasons for thermal loading decrease with greater dc.ch/D on the basis of charge velocity components measurements. As it turned out impossible to relate specific heat flux and temperature fields to charge motion alone, assumptions are outlined with regards to corresponding governing factor. In conclusion some advantages of shallow type com- bustion chambers as applied to highly boosted diesel en- gines are stressed along with problems to be solved. 831337. A finite difference scheme for the simulation of a fuel injection system. K. Kumar, Research De- sign and Standards Organisation, Indian Rail- ways, Lucknow, India; R. R. Gaur and R. D. 187</page><page sequence="169">831337-831344 Garg, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Indian Insti- tute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India; and M. K. Gajendra Babu, Centre of Energy Studies, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India. A finite difference scheme comprising of two step Lax- Wendroff and Leap-Frog techniques used to solve the conti- nuity and momentum equations for a fuel injection system, is described in this paper in addition to the method of characteristics. Newton-Raphson method and Bacchi's techniques have been tried to solve the boundary condition equations. A limited comparison with the well known Runge-Kutta scheme showed that the Newton-Raphson method is much simpler to apply and needs less computa- tional time. The validation of the above model has been carried out by comparing the predicted and experimental data of the fuel injection pressures and rates. This compari- son showed that the present model could be utilized to predict the performance of the injection system with a rea- sonable degree of accuracy. 831338. Estimating mixing and sooting in diffusion flames. Otto A. Uyehara, Univ. of Wisconsin- Madison, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg. Products from reacting propane and air have been con- structed for reactions under many different conditions. It is proposed in this paper to use C2H2 as a temperature indica- tor for diffusion flame. Published experimental data con- taining species is analyzed using the various plots to estimate the degree of mixing and sooting. 1983 SAE Transactions 831340. Development of a wheel slip monitor for a pan scraper. H. Stan Benson, Southwest Research In- stitute; and John M. Goris, U.S. Bureau of Mines. Expensive pan scraper tires are subjected, during the bowl loading cycle, to wheel slip far beyond that actually needed to produce optimum machine draft force. Virtually all scraper operators routinely spin the wheels vainly attempt- ing to produce more draft force than traction will permit. Available traction depends on terrain and tire load, which change unpredictably during the loading cycle, and it is difficult to load as rapidly as possible without slipping the unseen tires. The Wheel Slip Monitor provides two prompt and intuitively understandable operator warnings when any tire exceeds a preset slip rate: a beeping tone sounds accom- panied by a flashing light and both beep rate and light flashing increase in direct proportion to the slip rate of the worst wheel. Development and field testing are described and it is shown how the Wheel Slip Monitor makes practi- cal the acquisition of certain unique tire test data. The potential advantages of automatic wheel slip control are discussed. 831341. A design methodology for reducing product de- velopment lead time. William Ross McCord, WABCO Construction and Mining Equipment. The need for a foreshortened product development lead time has become a necessity, in today's economy, to the efficient manufacturing of off-highway mining trucks. This paper reviews the approach taken by one noted truck man- ufacturer. By utilizing finite element analysis, plastic scale modeling techniques, and a comprehensive full scale test facility, the development lead time of the WABCO 100 Ton HAULPAK was reduced to 60% of that normally required for the development of a new product from conceptual layout to production release. HAULPAK is a registered trademark of American Standard Inc. 831342. The design and development of a 2000 pound ca- pacity articulate loader. Carman Lynnes and William Long, Melroe Division, Clark Equip- ment Co. This paper will review the design and development of a 2000 pound capacity articulate loader. It will focus on de- sign concepts to achieve a cost effective quality loader for the low capitalized customer. It will reveal some new con- cepts in the application of hydrostatic drives and simplified mechanical power transmissions to achieve cost and quality objectives. 831343. Boron-treated high strength structural steels and their application to automotive components. Fu- kukazu Nakasato, Michitaka Fujita, and Kazu- hiko Nishida, Kokura Steel Works, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd.; Hiroo Ohtani, Central Re- search Labs, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd.; and Tetsu Ohno, Osaka Head Office, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd. Systematic experimental work has been conducted on the factors affecting toughness of boron-treated high strength structural steels for a wide range of tensile strength. It is clarified that, by a sophisticated control of such factors as chemical composition, tempering temperature, degree of hardening, and thermomechanical treatment, etc., more ef- fective utilization of boron grades is sure to expand. Several proven and potential applications of boron steels to auto- motive components are briefly described. 1983 SAE Transactions 831344. The design and development of the B series diesel engine. Philip E. Jones, Francis M. Hager, and Bryan W. Swank, Cummins Engine Company, Inc., Columbus, IN. The B Series product line consists of 3, 4 and 6-cy linder high swirl direct injection diesel engines having a displace- ment of .98 liters per cylinder. They were designed to achieve high levels of turbocharging with conservative com- ponent loading. The seven most important design objectives were durability, reliability, sociability, performance, appli- 188</page><page sequence="170">831344-831349 cation adaptability, cost and service. The design concepts employed are discussed in some detail and results are given for typical analyses performed during the design phase. Op- timized engine performance data is presented for emission regulated and non-emission regulated configurations. The mechanical development and validation of the design are also discussed along with the accompanying results. This development and validation process included rig tests, fa- tigue tests, endurance tests, abuse tests, field tests and relia- bility proof tests. Some typical approaches to cost avoidance are enumerated towards the end of the paper. 831345. Heat insulated turbocompound engine. Kosuke Toyama, Toshio Yoshimitsu, Toshihiko Nishiya- ma, Tomoki Shimauchi, and Tsutomu Nakagaki, Engine Research Div., Oyama Plant, Komatsu Ltd. A program to demonstrate high thermal efficiency of a heat insulated turbocompound diesel engine was carried out. Major problems were choosing proper heat resisting mate- rials, obtaining high mechanical and thermal efficiency of components, providing lubrication oil which works at high temperature and controling heat flux from a combustion chamber. A six cylinder, 125mm bore, turbocharged diesel en- gine was chosen for this program. Ceramic coating was mainly employed as a means of insulating heat and protect- ing engine parts. For the heat insulation, a ductile cast iron piston coated with Zr02 was used and the cooling water was entirely eliminated. Heat flow analysis was conducted both analytically and experimentally. Thus, heat rejection was reduced by about 35%. While maximum temperature of the cylinder wall was raised up to 350°C, no scuffing and excessive wear took place in the sliding parts of a single cylinder engine for 500 hours. It was found that improvement in efficiency of compo- nents such as a turbocharger, an aftercooler, a gear train and a power recovery turbine was very important to in- crease the thermal efficiency of the total system. The heat insulation including the effect of the reduction in fan driv- ing power and turbocompounding contributed to improve the fuel consumption by an amount of 11.2%. As a result of the program, the engine with the thermal efficiency of 48% (171g/kwh) was obtained. 1983 SAE Transactions 831346.

This paper presents a survey of recent developments in computer technology which impact modeling and simula- tion of hydraulic systems. Trends in design of Central Proc- essing Units (CPU), mass storage and input/output devices are reviewed from a user's perspective. Their effect on cur- rent techniques of modeling and simulation, and presentation of results are examined. Principles of operating systems are explained and ap- plication of data base management techniques for storing test data and other pertinent information is examined. Finally, areas in which software for hydraulic system modeling could be enhanced are outlined. 831347. Predicting stability behaviour of hydraulic sys- tems containing proportional valves. P. Christian- sen, Danfoss A/S, Nordborg, Denmark; and F. Conrad and E. Trostmann, The Technical Uni- versity of Denmark, Copenhagen, Control Engi- neering Laboratory. The article describes the set-up of a linear and a non-linear model of a proportional valve in a system with external load and a fixed pump. The non-linear model is simulated using CSMP and results of the simulation will be presented. By means of the linear model and the state space me- thod, the stability of the proportional valve with loadmass as parameter is discussed. The article illustrates how it will be possible by means of the aforementioned computer methods to predict the influence of different parameters on the stability of a pro- portional valve, even in complex operating situations. 831348. Improvements in agricultural tractor clutch per- formance. Ian C. Maycock, Automotive Products pic. This paper describes a field trial investigating if a dia- phragm spring cover assembly and rigid driven plate would give improved performance over the production coil spring cover assembly and spring centre driven plate. Also de- scribed is subsequent rig testing carried out to find an alter- native non-asbestos facing. The field trial was successful with a life improvement of 100% together with improved release and engagement characteristics and gear selection. An alternative heavy duty asbestos material was found and a cerametallic mate- rial gave the best non-asbestos result. Further testing is proposed at a reduced duty level in an effort to improve correlation between rig testing and the field trial and this will be extended to include other non- asbestos materials which have recently become available. 831349. Electrohydraulic dual power-shift control for ag- ricultural tractors. Louis C. Harms, United Tech- nologies Corp., Automotive Group, Components Div., Fluid Power Systems, Wheeling, IL. Earlier transmissions were equipped with a complex me- chanical linkage for actuating the dual power planetary gear set. Field experience revealed the need for a reliable, simplified and less expensive method for this particular transmission control. An electrohydraulic directional con- trol valve was developed to provide an economical design 189</page><page sequence="171">831349-831355 improvement which was readily incorporated into present models. 831350. A new generation of electro-hydraulic control for hydrostatic transmissions. Allen Myers, Sund- strand Hydro-Transmission. The use of electro-hydraulic control of hydrostatic trans- missions on mobile equipment has been limited by the high cost, marginal performance, marginal reliability and poor serviceability of previously available controls. Rapidly in- creasing usage of electronics on mobile equipment has cre- ated a strong need for an electro-hydraulic control without these limitations. A design program was established to de- velop an entirely new control which both overcomes previous limitations and meets future needs. This was ac- complished by selecting the proper design concept to allow meeting all design goals, then carefully implementing and thoroughly qualifying the concept in hardware. 831351. A corporate product quality assurance program. William R. Carey, Eaton Corp. This paper outlines what a large company is doing on a corporate staff basis to help combat Product Liability prob- lems. Eaton Corporation is multi-national and serves a vari- ety of markets. The extensive and complex line of products dictates the need for a well organized, corporate Product Assurance Program. The program is made up of five thrusts: 1) Corporate Policy, 2) Guidelines, 3) Divisional Committees, 4) Surveys and 5) Training. Utilizing a product development project, the imple- mentation of several elements of Product Quality Assur- ance are explained. The program was designed for flexibil- ity and emphasizes the chairman's motto to "DO IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME, EVERY TIME." 831352. Nature and reduction of cycle-to-cycle combus- tion variation in an IDI diesel engine with ethanol-diesel fuel blends. Tadashi Murayama, Takanobu Yamada, Noboru Miyamoto, and Takemi Chikahisa, Dept. of Mechanical Engi- neering, Hokkaido Univ. Many of the promising alternative fuels have relatively low cetane numbers, and may result in combustion variation problems. This paper presents the characteristics of the cycle-to-cycle combustion variations in diesel engines, and analyzes and evaluates the mechanism. Combustion variations appear in various forms, such as variations in ignition lag, indicated mean effective pressure, maximum combustion pressure, or rate of heat release. These variations are clearly correlated, and it is possible to represent the combustion variations by the stan- dard deviation in the combustion peak pressure. The com- bustion variations are random (non-periodic), and are af- fected by ethanol amount, intake air temperature, engine speed and other various operating conditions. Theoretical analysis based on auto ignition theory showed that all of these factors affecting the combustion variations could be correlated with ignition lag; a reduction in ignition lag is the most effective to reduce combustion variation. 831353. Emissions, efficiency, and durability of agricul- tural diesel engines using low-proof ethanol. Jerry R. Allsup, U.S. Department of Energy, Bartles- ville Energy Technology Center. Experimental investigations were made to evaluate the po- tential of using low-proof ethanol to supplement diesel fuel in agricultural engines. Fumigation, mechanical emulsifica- tion, and chemical emulsifiers were used to introduce a significant amount of alcohol with diesel fuel for engine operation. A total of five diesel tractor engines were tested using each of the fuel systems. Exhaust products and fuel usage were determined at various engine speed/load condi- tions. A 500-hour engine durability test was conducted on three of the engines using 25% 160-proof ethanol with die- sel fuel. Two tests were conducted using fumigation, and one test was done with a mechanical fuel emulsifier. Results suggest that approximately 25% alcohol can be used with diesel fuel to realize essentially the same thermal efficiency as diesel fuel. In addition, no adverse effects on engine life expectancy were apparent using 25% 160-proof ethanol fumigated into an engine. However, using the same fuels and a mechanical emulsification fuel introduction system led to premature engine failure. 831354. Propane fumigation in a direct injection type die- sel engine. K. S. Varde, The University of Michigan-Dearborn, Dearborn, MI. An experimental study was conducted to evaluate the use of propane and natural gas as fuels for diesel engines. Experi- ments were conducted by injecting different quantities of pilot diesel fuel at a fixed injection timing. The amount of pilot quantity was found to influence the engine perform- ance, particularly at low loads. The engine thermal effi- ciency, emissions and noise were found to depend on the overall equivalence ratio as well as on the quantity of pilot injection. 831355. Performance of lubricating oils in vegetable oil ester-fuelled diesel engines. J. H. Blackburn, R. Pinchin, and J. I. T. Nobre, Shell Brasil S.A.; and B. A. L. Crichton, and H. W. Cruse, Shell Re- search Ltd. A series of engine dynamometer tests was carried out with 100% ethyl ester of soya oil as fuel and six different diesel engine lubricants. In each case the lubricant became con- taminated by unburnt fuel during the tests with measured dilution rates of up to 0.2% of the fuel throughput. The lubricant/fuel mixture eventually underwent degradation to such an extent that phase separation occurred. The tests were terminated when the lubricant lost all dispersancy, as 190</page><page sequence="172">831355 - 831361 evaluated by a blotter-spot test. Used oil analysis revealed that rapid oxidation of some of the fatty acid ester compo- nents of the fuel diluent had occurred in the later stages of the tests. At the high levels of fuel dilution recorded in these tests there was little difference between the performances of the six lubricants, despite their differing performance cate- gories. It is therefore concluded that conventional perform- ance categories cannot be used to define the grade of lubri- cant necessary for use with 100% vegetable oil ester fuels. 831356. Sunflower oil esters: an alternative fuel for direct injection diesel engines. C. S. Hawkins, J. Fuis, and F. J. C. Hugo, Div. of Agricultural Engineer- ing, Dept. of Agriculture, Republic of South Af- rica. Alternative fuels have received considerable attention since the early seventies with alcohol being initially most promi- nent. In particular ethyl alcohol seemed very attractive be- cause of possible on-farm production and the renewable source material. Because alcohol is not a very suitable com- pression ignition fuel, plant oils began to be investigated as alternative fuels. It was shown that these oils cause coking of the injector nozzles in direct injection engines and esters of plant oils were tested as a possible solution to the prob- lem. From these tests fuel properties were determined and specifications derived. Combustion studies were carried out and compatability tests performed. Engine durability was tested under a manufacturer's prescribed cyclic load condi- tions over a period of 1500 hours with extremely good results. 831357. Engine durability tests with sunflower oil in an indirect injection diesel engine. C. S. Hawkins, J. Fuis, and F. J. C. Hugo, Div. of Agricultural Engineering, Dept. of Agriculture, Republic of South Africa. Various reports have shown that plant oils can power diesel engines, but unmodified direct injection engines coke up when operated on these fuels for any length of time. Indi- rect injection engines are known to be more tolerant of fuel quality and a research programme to test the long-term durability of such an engine with sunflower oil as fuel was launched. The successful results of this test programme which led to the manufacturer extending the warranty on this engine to cover this type of fuel are presented. 831358. Performance of vegetable oils and their mo- noesters as fuels for diesel engines. Gerhard Vell- guth, Institute for Basic Research in Agricultural Engineering at the FAL, Braunschweig, Ger- many. Vegetable oils have the potential to be used as fuels for diesel engines. But in direct injection engines as they are used for agricultural tractors and trucks some difficulties with vegetable oils - even with fully refined oils - are no- ticed, so that long time operation is impossible. Engine tests were made to evaluate some modifications to these oils. The result is that the former problems do not occur with déri- vâtes of vegetable oils after transesterification with ethanol or methanol, if the injection is advanced. 1983 SAE Transactions 831359. Vegetable oils as a potential alternate fuel in di- rect injection diesel engines. M. Ziejewski, Univ. of North Dakota. Laboratory endurance tests were performed on a direct injected, turbocharged, and intercooled diesel engine. A 25/75 blend (v/v) of alkali refined sunflower oil with diesel fuel and a 25/75 blend (v/v) of high oleic safflower oil and diesel fuel were tested. For comparison prior to the tests with the experimental fuels, a baseline endurance run with Phillips D2 Reference Fuel was carried out. The major problems experienced while operating on the 25/75 blend of alkali-refined sunflower oil and diesel fuel were premature injection nozzle performance deteriora- tion and heavier carbonaceous buildup in the compression ring grooves and on the piston lands. There was no signifi- cant problems with engine operation when using the 25/75 blend of high oleic safflower oil and diesel fuel. Based on the results of this investigation, the 25-75 blend of high oleic safflower oil with diesel fuel is a very promising candidate as an alternate fuel. This investigation provides evidence that chemical dif- ferences between the vegetable oils have a very important influence on long term engine performance. In the tested fuel viscosity range it appears that the chemical properties rather than fuel viscosity is the major factor which deter- mines engine performance deterioration while using vegeta- ble oil fuels. 831360. High concentration ethanol-diesel blends for compression-ignition engines. P. Meiling, A. C. Hansen, A. P. Vosloo, and P. W. L. Lyne, Agri- cultural Engineering Dept., University of Natal, Pietermaritzburg, R.S.A. A fuel blend containing 30 percent ethanol, diesel fuel and additives was tested in a diesel tractor to determine its effect on engine performance and durability. Uprating the deliv- ery of the fuel injection pump was found to be a practical method of restoring the 1 1 percent power reduction caused by the lower heat content of the blend. Operation of the tractor under on-farm conditions for alternate 100 hour periods totalling 2000 hours on diesel fuel and on the blend revealed no noticeable deterioration in engine condition re- lated to the blend. 831361. The combustion and emissions of coal-oil mixture with water (COM) as an alternative fuel for die- sel engines. Shan-dsui Shang, Shanghai Ship and Shipping Research Institute; and Lian-fan Zhang, Huan-zhang Xu, and Guo-qiang Chou, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University. 191</page><page sequence="173">831361 -831368 For selection of an optimum COM preparation system, a series of tests on high intensity ultrasonic mixing devices is performed. A brief description of the system is presented. A coal-fuel oil-water mixture up to 25% coal concen- tration has been used as an alternative fuel in China stan- dard Model 195-2 Single cylinder, 10 H.P. at rated 1800 RPM and Model 2135 Two cylinders, 40 H.P. at rated 1500 RPM diesel engines with very encouraging. Preliminary tests results are given in this paper. 831362. A review and comparison of reciprocating engine operation using solid fuels. J. A. Caton, Texas A&amp;M University, College Station, TX; and K. H. Rosegay, Southwest Research Institute, San An- tonio, TX. Future fuels for internal-combustion engines will be derived increasingly from solids such as coal. An alternative to processing coal into liquid fuels is the direct use of solid coal by reciprocating, internal-combustion engines. Specific applications which would be especially suitable for solid fueled engines consist of stationary power plants, marine propulsion systems, and railroad locomotives. Agricultural, construction and mining equipment are examples of other possible applications. The objectives of this study were to review past research on the development of solid coal fueled engines and, from this review, to identify major technical problems and current research needs. The objectives also included comparing the energy usage of several fuels. This comparison indicated a possible 25% energy advantage by directly using solid coal fuels as opposed to using synfuels. The literature review indicated that operation of solid reciprocating engine has been attempted for nearly a hun- dred years. Problems which have been encountered contin- uously have involved the fuel delivery system, solid-particle combustion, and engine component wear. Recent investiga- tions (1979-1982) using coal/oil, carbon-black/oil, and coal/water slurries in a variety of reciprocating engines have yielded encouraging results. The use of coal/water slurries is an attractive approach to using solid coal in en- gines, since fuel handling problems are simpler than using dry-powder fuels, and the slurry is petroleum independent. 1983 SAE Transactions 831363. User oriented, computer aided hydraulic system design. Steven E. Martin, MERADCOM, Engi- neer Support Laboratory, Ft. Belvoir, VA; and I. T. Hong, Fluid Power Research Center, Stillwa- ter, OK. The Computer Aided Analysis and Simulation (CAAS) package is the result of a multiphased program aimed at developing a user oriented, computer aided design tech- nique for the analysis, design and specification of hydraulic power transmission systems. The package is intended to eliminate the need for detailed computer programming on the part of the system designer and allows effective use of the technique by anyone familiar with the CAAS package. This study has included the development of the general system analysis and optimization techniques, the develop- ment of the Problem Oriented Language (POL), modeling of the most commonly used hydraulic components and testing of a selected group of hydraulic system components to verify the models developed. This paper presents the rationale of the CAAS package. The theoretical basis, pro- gram structure and application examples are included. 1983 SAE Transactions 831364. Finite element modeling programs for a two di- mensional CAD package. Robert G. Dubensky, Kelsey-Hayes Light Vehicle Brakes (Work com- plete while working as an Independent Consult- ing Engineer). Eight 2-D finite element program modules are integrated into an effective analysis tool for improving the productiv- ity in the design cycle. Three preprocessing modules can generate a finite element mesh, display the mesh, and file the finite element model into an inventory of models. Two- dimensional stress analysis, heat transfer analysis, and tor- sion analysis of the part can be performed. Deformed geom- etry and contour plots can be used to summarize the analysis results. The usefulness of this integrated approach and the cost effectiveness are illustrated by three examples. 1983 SAE Transactions 831365. Introduction to gear design. Saul Herscovici, Power Engineering &amp; Mfg., Ltd., Waterloo, Iowa, USA. The purpose of this article is to provide the design formulas and acceptable stress levels so that calculations of the gear surface compressive and bending stresses at which the gears will operate in a known application can be made. It will be necessary to know the complete gear information for all gears, such as number of teeth, diametral pitch, pressure angle, gear width, type of material, and type of heat treat- ment, if any. The surface compressive and bending stresses are based on American Gear Manufacturers Association (AGMA) formulas and tables, and the applications stress limits are based on Machine Design recommended safe stress levels and authors past experience. By combining the proper number of teeth with the proper size tooth, the proper pressure angle, the proper material and heat treat- ment, a durable gear box can be designed to offer a long life under any operating conditions. 1983 SAE Transactions 831368. Development of thrust carrying cylindrical radial roller bearings. Klaus Kispert, SKF Kugellager- fabriken GmbH; and Art Mattson, SKF Indus- tries, Inc. 192</page><page sequence="174">831368-831376 The axial load carrying capacity of cylindrical roller bear- ings is not primarily related to the fatigue strength of the material, but to the lubrication conditions, and consequently the contact conditions between the roller ends and the guid- ing surface of the flange. Therefore, friction and attendant heat generation should be as low as possible at these contact positions. Analysis and testing have enabled the optimum geometric form for the roller end/flange contact to be de- fined with respect to minimum friction. 831369. The design, durability and performance of the turntable bearing for a small truck crane. N. Ka- shino and M. Ishimaru, NTN Toyo Bearing Co., Ltd. This paper presents the design of a single row four point angular contact ball bearing with external gear teeth used as a turntable bearing in a small truck crane. In addition Du- rability and Performance Tests are presented. The durabil- ity of induction hardened raceways, comparison of raceway materials, durability under oscillation with one-way load- ing, measurement of rotating torque and the mechanism of cage failure are some of the factors examined in this paper. 831370. The influence of misalignment on self-lubricated bearings. James H. Cooper, Jr., Garlock Bear- ings, Inc. In all structures there are several reasons why misalignment can occur at a bearing. This is especially true with large structures such as off-highway equipment of all types, agri- cultural tractors and implements and roadway vehicles. Equipment of these types will see more bearing alignment problems than smaller automobiles, garden equipment and machine tools. Misalignments can be attributed to distor- tion in welded units. Efforts to line bore long distances and simply the accumulation of tolerances on several parts also cause alignment problems. Even if the designer makes dili- gent efforts to reduce tolerancing and manufacturing inac- curacies, the bearing surface will still be subjected to structural misalignment simply due to load application even though not considered overloading. All of these misalign- ment causes can occur individually or simultaneously sub- sequently causing bearing overloading to shorten bearing life or crush the bearing. 1983 SAE Transactions 831371. Case depth for induction hardened slewing bear- ing rings. Oskar Zwirlein, Application Engineer- ing, FAG Kugelfischer, Schweinfurt, West Ger- many; and Walter P. Wieland, Engineering, FAG Bearings Corp., Stamford, CT. In this paper the strength of material based on the stressing in rolling contact is described. The investigations result in a guideline according to which the case depth of slewing bear- ing rings can be determined, if the load on the rolling ele- ments, their size, and the number of load cycles are known. It is explained why the case depths should not be overdi- mensioned for manufacturing and strength reasons. Further discussions include the checking of the hardening, the influence of the soft section on the strength of the material, and the influence of the surrounding structure on the load distribution. An example illustrates that the stressing of the parts in rolling contact can be a multiple of the value calcu- lated with a rigid structure if there are hard points in the surrounding structure. 831372. Trials and tribulations of fatigue testing of bear- ings. Robert W. Hacker, The Timken Co. This paper, while not intended to be a comprehensive guide to all of the details of fatigue testing of bearings, does give an overview of the basic considerations that must be ad- dressed. Compromises are always made in fatigue studies, and this paper provides information on the associated im- plications. Included is a discussion on the life scatter normally encountered in fatigue testing, means and limits of acceler- ating testing, and comments regarding equipment and cost. 831373. Bearings for large capacity crane applications. Heinrich Siemensmeyer, Rothe Erde-Schmiedag AG, West Germany; and Stephen F. Aaronson, Rotek Inc., Aurora, OH. The evolution of the modern large diameter rolling contact bearing is traced from early engineering concepts to today's modern bearings which are able to perform in multiple load situations. The benefits of the slewing bearing design con- cept are explored and applied to large lifting capacity appli- cations. Several alternative slewing bearing options are dis- cussed and compared. 831375. A composite approach to reducing abrasive wear. Barry J. Davies and Donald H. Wilding, Canron Inc., Foundry Div. Today, wearing parts are regularly subjected to abnormal loading conditions. They must be able to accept these con- ditions without failure. In continuous operations, unsche- duled downtime greatly increases maintenance costs, not to mention the cost of lost production. White iron castings offer premium abrasion resistance for many of these applications, but are often not used due to the possibility of brittle failure and the difficulty of mechan- ical attachment. This paper discusses the properties and applications of a composite of martensitic white iron and mild steel. This laminate will accept medium to high impact without loss of service failure, and can be installed by mechanical means or with welded attachment. 831376. How to select a hardfacing alloy. Howard N. Farmer, Stoody Co. Selecting the right hard-facing alloy for the job is not as difficult as it may seem if one just follows a few simple steps. First, determine the composition of the part and the 193</page><page sequence="175">831376-831390 type of weld deposit that is needed (must it be machinable, crack-free, etc.); secondly, determine the wear pattern the part is likely to undergo; and third, pick the most cost- effective alloy and deposition process for your needs. 831377. Hardsurfaced plate and its applications. Dick Krahn, President, Chamfer Engineering, Minne- apolis, Minnesota, U.S.A. Because of its ability to outwear other wear-resistant mate- rials in various hostile environments, Hardsurfaced Plate should be considered to solve wear problems when the se- lection criteria are cost, wear life and ability to perform in the environment. In addition to its cost-effective performance, Hardsur- face Plate is versatile. It can be cut, drilled, formed and welded for use in many types of wear service applications. These attributes - toughness and versatility, as well as cost-effectiveness - have made Hardsurfaced Plate the ac- cepted solution to wear problems in many industries, and will continue to be significant considerations for wear serv- ice problems in the future. 831379. In-situ measurement of fretting-wear: a design approach. Harvey Lyons, University of New Hampshire. Fretting occurs in mechanical or structural joints that were not intended to move, relative to each other, but because of vibrational loads or cyclical deformation, experience minute cyclic relative motion. Fretting -wear develops as a form of wear that retains the majority of the wear debris within the contacting interface. Fretting-wear failure may be defined in functional terms of the normal approach accrued. The magnitude of normal approach due to fretting-wear can be measured in-situ as a function of cycles of operation. These data can be transcribed directly into design curves to enable prediction of impending functional failure in mechani- cal/structural joints subjected to fretting-wear. Supporting parametric data have evolved from these experimental in- vestigations yielding further insight to the phenomenon of fretting-wear in steels such as SAE 1020, SAE 4340 and SAE 52100. Further research in this branch of tribology will prove of value to designers whose systems reside in a dynamic environment. 1983 SAE Transactions 831380. Need for robotics and mechanical research. L. N. Shaw, University of Florida, Agricultural Engi- neering Department. Competition in manufactured goods from Japan has devel- oped in recent years and now they are turning to automatic manufacturing systems and robots to maintain their lead. The United States needs to increase its development and utilization of robots in manufacturing and in other areas so that we can remain competitive. Some of our agricultural production is very well mechanized but other operations such as transplanting and fruit and vegetable harvesting are being done the same way as they were 50 or more years ago. Robots have wide potential application in agriculture to do the tedious tasks that are so common. Progress is being made in the development of a robotic sheep shearing ma- chine and developments in robotic planting machines and citrus harvesters are being considered. Substitution of ro- bots or other automatic machines for tedious tasks in agri- cultural operations will help keep food economical in price and improve working conditions for farm workers. 831381. Advances in hydraulics for tractor loader back- hoes. Vinrod Nanda, Sperry Vickers. The conventional circuits for tractor loader backhoes gener- ally consist of fixed displacement pump and valves that bypass excess flow resulting in poor efficiency. Poor ma- chine controllability, high operator actuating forces, lack of pressure compensation and other problems have warranted development of better hydraulic circuits. These and many more handicaps are overcome in Vickers new design of sectional directional valves assisted by a load sensing variable displacement pump. An overview of possible alternate circuits is presented here with a description of the features of a new CMX sec- tional valve and its application in a tractor loader backhoe circuit. 831382. Load sense steering design considerations. Allan R. Steinkuhl, TRW Ross Gear Division. Load sensed steering systems have proven themselves as a method of energy conservation in the present and will con- tinue to be in the future. Not all vehicle systems lend them- selves to load sense steering. When considering a hydro- static steering system all the design parameters must be evaluated. First, it must be determined if a load sense sys- tem is the optimum steering system and then the best suited load sense system for the application must be chosen. This paper deals with some of the criteria for choosing a hydro- static steering system and will look at various types of load sense steering systems. 1983 SAE Transactions 831383. Steering of large articulated vehicles. H. J. Cor- nett, Danfoss A/S, Nordborg, Denmark. The lecture deals with the special conditions that have to be taken into account in the steering of large articulated ve- hicles, for example the control of oil flow, positive and negative control forces. The systems that are used today are described and their advantages and disadvantages outlined. Examples of systems are hydraulic/mechanical and hydrostatic steering. Under subject of hydrostatic steering, the Flow ampli- fier system is dealt with in detail. 831390. The 1983 Formula SAE Championship Competi- tion. Ronald Douglas Matthews, Richard K. Morton, and Billy H. Wood, Univ. of Texas. 194</page><page sequence="176">831390-831397 This paper discusses the Formula SAE Student Engineering Design Competition that was held May 26-28, 1983. As was the case of previous student engineering design competi- tions, the purpose of the Formula SAE Competition is to enhance engineering education by requiring students to ap- ply the technical knowledge gained in their coursework to a practical engineering design problem including choice of ap- propriate design criteria, design, fabrication, testing, and evaluation. For the Formula SAE Competition, the design problem chosen is to design, construct, and compete a low powered Formula type race car. The purpose of this paper is to describe the 1983 Formula SAE Competition and to pre- sent the results of this event. It is expected that this paper will serve as a guide to hosts of similar competitions and will aid future Formula SAE competitors. 831391. The effect of aluminum oxide structure on adhe- sive bonding. Thomas L. Wilkinson, Reynolds Metals Co. When one wishes to bond aluminum alloys and obtain du- rable bonds, it has been conventional practice to clean and remove the mill oxide chemically and deposit another oxide surface which then is more receptive to forming a strong adhesive bond. Much work has been done in recent years by the adhesive manufacturers to develop adhesive systems which produce durable bonds to untreated surfaces. Their efforts using reactive acrylic and rubber modified epoxies have been largely successful. The more one knows about the surface to be bonded, the better the possibility of producing a durable bonding system. This paper addresses some of those factors concerning the aluminum oxide surface. A model for the aluminum oxide structure is presented and evidence given that indicates that with 5182 alloy, bond failure can be related to failure of the magnesium oxide within the aluminum oxide structure. 831394. How to avoid (or win) products litigation. John R. Dawson and Robert L. Binder, Foley &amp; Lardner, Milwaukee, WI. The designer of products which can cause serious personal injury should be aware that the law of products liability imposes responsibilities which go beyond the normal expec- tations of professional care and competency. In addition, the successful defense of a design in a products liability trial often hinges upon the quality and thoroughness of the doc- umentary record maintained of the design process. A prac- tical understanding of the products liability system will enable the designer to take effective measures to decrease the number of products liability actions and increase the likelihood of winning the suits which are brought. 1983 SAE Transactions 831395. Engineering considerations on litigation avoid- ance. William J. Lux, Product Engineering Cen- ter, John Deere Industrial Equipment Div., Du- buque, IA. It is generally understood that engineers can do some things to help prevent product liability lawsuits. However, it is not so well understood that very likely the best way to prevent lawsuits is at the engineering stage. This paper reviews conventional activities of that type and describes a general philosophy that if the engineer works to prevent the accident, he will be making the most effective contribution. In addition, the paper presents a new viewpoint con- cerning "trade-offs" between safety and product effective- ness. The paper suggests that trade-offs are not even appro- priate things to consider, but that the engineering effort must be to raise product effectiveness and safety - both - to successfully higher levels. The tension, for example, be- tween cost and safety will never disappear. The engineer's response must be to raise the level of safety without in- creasing product cost and reducing product cost without sacrificing safety. That is the real engineering objective. 1983 SAE Transactions 831396. Cold startability of open-chamber direct- injection diesel engines - part II: combustion chamber design and fuel spray geometry and ad- ditional air and glow plug as a starting aid. Ramkrishna Phatak, Southwest Research Insti- tute; and Tadao Nakamura, Komatsu, Ltd. A study was performed to evaluate the influence of com- bustion chamber design and fuel spray geometry on cold startability. High-squish toroidal, high-squish bowl, and Mexican hat-type combustion chambers were tested. In each case, the effects of fuel-air mixing process on cold startability was studied at different starting temperatures and injection tim- ings. Cold startability aids, such as additional air for start- ing purposes and glow plugs, were tested with each of the above combustion chambers. Chamber designs with high squish and swirl and fuel impingement on the walls were found to be undesirable for good cold startability. Improved cold startability resulted from locally non-uniform air-fuel ratios with a well organ- ized air swirl-fuel spray pattern. Glow plugs were found to be desirable for improved cold startability. 831397. Accepting CAD/CAM as a way of doing busi- ness. Ronald E. Hursh, International Harvester Co. This paper describes Computer-Aided Design and Manu- facturing Systems in terms of software models usable in design and manufacturing engineering environments to in- crease overall productivity and product quality using fewer people in less time. Emphasis is placed on the key factors involved in promoting the acceptance of CAD/CAM from its initial introduction to managing the resulting organiza- tional changes. 195</page><page sequence="177">831397-831414 Contemporary definitions of Computer-Aided Design and Computer-Aided Manufacturing are included along with a short history of computers used in engineering (in- cluding the use of personal computers). The field data includes sample CAD/CAM system uti- lization from our industry with estimated productivity fig- ures and projected usage. It is presented in tabular and case form. The approach used is one of first identifying the capa- bilities and then referencing reported data from companies who have implemented the capability. 831405. Effects of FAR 25.1309 on airplane operation and maintenance. James J. Treacy, Federal Avia- tion Administration. More and more transport airplane designs are being af- fected by the requirements of Section 25.1309 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as their certification bases include Amendment 25-23. Although this regulation became effec- tive in 1970 and Advisory Circular No. 25.1309-1 was pub- lished in 1982, misunderstandings still exist concerning its application and its effects on maintenance and operations. This paper attempts to clarify some of the more common misconceptions about numerical methods of analysis and to outline how the results of these analyses may affect airplane maintenance and operations. Maintenance effects are gener- ally of the type which require that a particular inspection or test be accomplished within a specified time. Operational effects have been minor to date and have been limited to specifying a time allowed for airplane dispatch with certain equipment inoperative. 831406. The effect of regulation 25.1309 on aircraft de- sign and maintenance. D. L. Gilles, Douglas Air- craft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp., Long Beach, CA. In the 13 years since it was amended to require rational safety assessments of aircraft systems, Federal Air Regula- tion Part 25.1309 has had a significant impact, both positive and negative, on system design and maintenance practices in the civil aircraft industry. The regulation has fostered genuine system engineering and has provided the only via- ble methodology available for assessing and certifying some new critical and complex aircraft functions. At the same time it has perturbed long-standing, historically proven de- sign and maintenance concepts. It has generated much con- troversy, notably over the use of quantitative probability for assessing risk, and has been widely misunderstood both by industry and the FAA. These and other positive and nega- tive effects of the regulation are discussed in this paper, together with the background leading to the philosophy and methods of compliance presently embodied in the regula- tion and its related guidance material. 1983 SAE Transactions 831411. Digital flight control system EMI/EMP testing - lessons learned. D. G. Bailey and G. L. Graves, Honeywell Inc., Military Avionics Div., Minneapolis, MN. A laboratory test facility has been developed to apply full- scale lightning and EMP fields to safety-critical digital flight control systems early in the development process. Such testing enables relatively low-cost evaluation of system susceptibility, allows in-depth study of the effects of distur- bances, and provides essential feedback to system engineers attempting to harden the design. Results indicate that: o Proper design practice results in systems that can tolerate fields associated with lightning strikes or EMP to levels projected within a metal-skinned aircraft. o Lightning/EMP tests do uncover design faults and are of value early in the development process. o Optical data bus mechanization outperformed a con- ventional wire bus in high-level transient fields, as expected. 1983 SAE Transactions 831412. (P-132) Aircraft accidents are caused - a brief human factors analogy related to recent acci- dents. Donald D. Engen, National Transporta- tion Safety Board. Aviation accidents are two-phased. Human factors clearly dominate the first and most important incident phase. Al- though aircraft accident rates are being reduced gradually, there is a percentage increase in man-caused accidents due to improved equipment, reliability, and operations monitor- ing capability. The continuing dialogue between federal reg- ulatory agencies and the National Transportation Safety Board has helped force change in design and in regulation and, in turn, improve safety in the four categories of civil aviation. Authority and accountability must always remain firmly linked together if there is to be continued safety improvement, because safety depends on people. 831413. (P-132) The Air Florida and Pan American acci- dents - a further look. Janis H. Stokłosa, Na- tional Transportation Safety Board, Washington, DC. A systematic review of the psychological literature reveals that there is a multiplicity of factors that can affect and interact with human performance. This paper describes some human performance lessons that can be learned from the Air Florida Flight 90 and Pan American Clipper 759 accidents. It suggests enhancing current training programs in specific areas. In addition, the factual information nec- essary for a detailed investigation of the human perform- ance aspects of an accident is outlined. 831414. (P-132) The role of aircraft recorders in human performance investigations. Gerrit J. Walhout, National Transportation Safety Board, Washing- ton, DC. 196</page><page sequence="178">831414-831421 About 60% of all accidents are attributed to limitations or degradations in pilot performance. Efforts to learn the rea- sons why these apparent errors in behavior or performance occur have been largely speculative until Flight Data Recor- ders and Cockpit Voice Recorders became available in large transport aircraft. Two accidents are examined in which the data provided by the aircraft recorders were employed to explain the underlying reasons for the sequence of events that culminated in the accidents. These analyses provide an insight into the behavioral, operational and environmental factors affecting pilot performance. It is concluded that air- craft recorders are essential basic tools of the human per- formance investigator requiring quality, dependability and state-of-the-art equipment to refine the investigative meth- odology of human performance investigations. 831415. (P-132) Pilot monitoring of airplane acceleration on takeoff. James W. Danaher, National Trans- portation Safety Board, Washington, DC. Timely detection of subnormal acceleration and appropriate pilot reaction either to continue the takeoff or to reject it and stop on the remaining runway is vital to the safe opera- tion of today's transport category airplanes. But ironically, pilots have no direct, accurate means to assess actual air- plane acceleration during takeoff. Despite a history of infre- quent but sometimes catastrophic accidents in which take- off performance was a factor, little progress has been made to remedy this situation. Occasionally used techniques and two developmental systems to monitor acceleration are de- scribed. A novel and promising approach which uses the onboard inertial navigation system also is described and is advocated as a means to enhance pilot judgment and decision-making during the takeoff roll. This scheme offers potential for significant improvement of air transport safety with a minimum of development effort and equipment cost. 831416. (P-132) Workload assessment metrics - what happens when they dissociate? Thomas M. McCloy and William L. Derrick, Department of Behavioral Sciences and Leadership, U.S. Air Force Academy; and Christopher D. Wickens, Aviation Research Lab, Institute of Aviation, University of Illinois, Champaign, IL. As systems become increasingly more complex, operator workload frequently is the major limitation to system per- formance. System designers have employed a variety of metrics attempting to assess workload in various settings. Confusion exists as to data interpretation when the metrics used provide different assessments; that is, they dissociate. This paper looks at two metrics - performance and subjec- tive ratings - and suggests a theory-based interpretation as to why dissociation occurs. The implications of this dissoci- ation to system design are then briefly summarized. 1983 SAE Transactions 831419. (P-132) Development and application of a crite- rion task set for workload metric evaluation. Clark A. Shingledecker, USAF Aerospace Medi- cal Research Laboratory; and William H. Acton and Mark S. Crabtree, Systems Research Labora- tories, Inc. In order to optimize the design and operation of modern military aircraft systems, methods are needed to measure the mental workload of the human operator. While numer- ous candidate metrics are now available for this purpose, little prescriptive information exists to guide their selection and application. This paper describes the development of a standardized methodology for the evaluation of workload measures against several theoretical and practical criteria. The central feature of this methodology is a set of repre- sentative loading tasks selected to place demands on pri- mary information processing resources of the operator. Re- sults are reported from an initial evaluation study in which a subset of these standardized tasks were employed to assess the characteristics of a behavioral workload measure. 1983 SAE Transactions 831420. (P-132) Operational aspects of the integrated ver- tical flight path and speed control system. A. A. Lambregts, Boeing Commercial Airplane Com- pany, Seattle, Washington. Operational aspects of a functionally integrated automatic flight path and speed control autopilot are discussed. A system is described using point mass energy principles to develop coordinated elevator and thrust commands and provide decoupled flight path and speed control for all the traditional autopilot and autothrottle functions. Various aspects of this integrated multi-input/multi-output system design on performance, operational capability, system ar- chitecture and redundancy requirements, hardware and software requirements are described. Also, possible mode control panel functional design improvements are dis- cussed. Feedback signal normalization into energy related quantities is shown to be the key to achieving natural con- trol decoupling with desired energy management features and consolidation of all computations for fully automatic control, computer augmented manual control and flight director thrust/elevator control guidance displays. The de- sign approach offers overall design coherency and simplic- ity. 1983 SAE Transactions 831421. (P-132) Validation methods for flight crucial systems. H. Milton Holt, NASA Langley Re- search Center, Hampton, VA. To take advantage of aeronautical research for improving the performance of future aerospace vehicles, highly reliable digital electronic systems will be required to perform flight crucial functions. Research at NASA's Langley Research Center is focused on actively pursuing development of tech- niques to form the basis for a validation methodology that 197</page><page sequence="179">831421 -831426 can determine the performance and reliability of advanced digital systems. The research includes development of ana- lytical models, emulation techniques, and experimental pro- cedures. The techniques and methods are verified using test specimens of fault-tolerant computers and systems and the capabilities of NASA's validation research laboratory, AIR- LAB. 1983 SAE Transactions 831422. (P-132) Man's role in a remote orbital servicing system. Jack E. Pennington and Walter W. Han- kins, III, NASA Langley Research Center. Advancing technology and existing needs are converging toward a new spacecraft system - a free-flying telemanipu- lator system which can perform satellite servicing, minor repairs, inspection, and retrieval. Langley is supporting the technology required and performing systems analysis for such a vehicle. Man is a major part of the system - performing both high level direction and lower level control functions, but sharing these functions with some onboard autonomy. This paper discusses the technical challenges and the role of man in such a system, and results from recent simulation studies. 1983 SAE Transactions 831423. (P-132) Practical guidance for the design of con- trols and displays for single pilot IFR. Roger H. Hoh, Systems Technology, Inc., Hawthorne, CA; and Hugh Bergeron and David Hinton, NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA. This paper represents a first step in developing the criteria for pilot interaction with advanced controls and displays in a single pilot IFR (SPIFR) environment. The research pro- gram presented herein is comprised of an analytical phase and an experimental phase. The analytical phase consisted of a review of fundamental considerations for pilot work- load taking into account existing data, and using that data to develop a SPIFR pilot workload model. The rationale behind developing such a model was based on the concept that it is necessary to identify and quantify the most impor- tant components of pilot workload to guide the experimen- tal phase of the research which consisted of an abbreviated flight test program. The purpose of the flight tests was to evaluate the workload associated with certain combinations of controls and displays in a flight environment. This was accomplished as a first step in building a data base for single pilot IFR controls and displays. 831424. (P-132) Summary of NASA Langley's pilot scan behavior research. Amos A. Spady, Jr. and Ran- dall L. Harris, Sr., NASA - Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA. The development of a real-time, non-intrusive, oculometer system and corresponding data reduction programs has provided a means of rapidly recording and analyzing scan- ning behavior data. Knowing where the pilot is looking is necessary but not sufficient information for determining instrument symbology, design and location. A number of scanning behavior myths have been examined and put in prospective. This paper discusses these and other findings obtained in a variety of studies conducted over the past seven years using Langley's Oculometer System. 831425. STOL and Maneuver Technology Program. Da- vid R. Selegan, Air Force Wright Aeronautical Laboratories, AFWAL/FIMS, WPAFB, OH. The STOL and Maneuver Technology Program, formally titled the "STOL Fighter Technology Program" has as its objective to demonstrate through flight test a short takeoff and landing capability on a supersonic fighter while en- hancing its performance capability in all other segments of the air-to-air mission. Specific task is to takeoff and land on a 1500 by 50 foot runway at night and during adverse weather conditions. To accomplish this task without sacrificing perform- ance requires the integration of advanced technologies into the aircraft. The technologies included in this effort are: a two dimensional thrust vectoring/reversing exhaust nozzle; integrated flight/propulsion control; cockpit displays and controls for all weather STOL operations; and rough/soft field landing gear. As presently structured, the program will modify an existing fighter like the F-15, F-16, or F-18. A contract will be awarded in late summer of 1983 and first flight is sched- uled for the fall of 1987. This technology thrust is directed at one possible so- lution to the runway interdiction problem facing our main operating bases in Europe. The program is structured to provide technology options in the design of the next genera- tion fighter but could have derivative applications to cur- rent fighters. 831426. Multi-functional nozzle for advanced weapon systems. D. J. Dusa, D. W. Speir, and D. K. Dunbar, Aircraft Engine Business Group, Gen- eral Electric Company, Cincinnati, Ohio. Over the past decade the performance requirements placed on advanced weapon systems has increased significantly. These requirements are aimed at increased operational ca- pability and result in the necessity to improve both the component efficiencies and operational characteristics of the weapon system components. From the standpoint of the exhaust system component, the requirements for greater operational capability have placed more emphasis on both engine/airframe integration and nozzle flexibility. Design studies have shown that in order to meet the future capabil- ities of the advanced weapon systems, multi-functional ex- haust nozzle systems with thrust reversing and thrust vec- toring capability will be necessary. In addition, exhaust nozzle functions, in all probability, will be shared by both the engine and aircraft control systems. Advanced technol- 198</page><page sequence="180">831426-831435 ogy exhaust system development status, including full scale and model scale test results, will be discussed in this paper. 1983 SAE Transactions 831427. Propulsion simulation test technique for V/STOL configurations. R. O. Bailey, S. C. Smith, and J. B. Gustie, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California. Ames Research Center is developing the technology for turbine-powered jet engine simulators so that airframe/pro- pulsion system interactions on V/STOL fighter aircraft and other highly integrated configurations can be studied. This paper describes the status of the compact multimission air- craft propulsion simulator (CMAPS) technology. Three CMAPS units have accumulated a total of 340 hr during approximately 1-1/2 y r of static and wind-tunnel testing. A wind-tunnel test of a twin-engine CMAPS-equipped close- coupled canard-wing V/STOL model configuration with nonaxisymmetric nozzles was recently completed. During this test approximately 140 total hours were logged on two CMAPS units, indicating that the rotating machinery is reliable and that the CMAPS and associated control system provide a usable test tool. However, additional development is required to correct a drive manifold O-ring problem that limits the engine-pressure-ratio (EPR) to approximately 3.5. 1 983 SAE Transactions 831428. VTOL controls for shipboard operations. V. K. Merrick and R. M. Gerdes, NASA Ames Re- search Center, Moffett Field, CA. Piloted, moving-base simulations have been performed in the evaluation of several VTOL control system concepts during landings on a destroyer in adverse weather condi- tions. All the systems incorporated attitude control aug- mentation; most systems incorporated various types of translational control augmentation implemented either through aircraft attitude or, more directly, through the pro- pulsion system (thrust magnitude and deflection). Only one of the control systems failed to provide satisfactory han- dling qualities in calm seas. Acceptable handling qualities in sea state 6 seem to require a system with control augmenta- tion in all translational degrees of freedom. 1 983 SAE Transactions 831431. Pressure transients in aerial refueling systems. T. J. Carter, III and M. E. Franke, Air Force Insti- tute of Technology, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH. Simulations of pressure transients are obtained for tanker aerial refueling systems during tanker disconnects from re- ceiver aircraft using a fluid transient analysis computer pro- gram. Effects of tanker nozzle valve closure characteristics on transient pressures are described. The results are com- pared with experimental results reported in the literature. Reasonable agreement is obtained. 831432. Predicting dynamic instability boundaries using lattice filters. Bruce H. Wendler, Lockheed- California Co. This paper discusses the use of lattice filter formulations for computing instability boundaries from subcriticai test data. Lattice filters have the inherent properties such that the instability mechanism does not have to be known a priori and the model order can be self adjusting for the data being observed. The filters are numerically efficient and there exist lattice filter forms where if the excitation force on the structure is Gaussian noise over the bandwidth of interest, then the input forces do not need to be measured. Results from an application of the lattice filter formulation on a high speed wind tunnel flutter model test show that the projected boundaries compare accurately with actual flutter boundaries encountered during the test. 831433. Characterizing the vibratory output of a multi- terminal machine and predicting the vibration of the supporting structure. Alan O. Sykes, Reso- nics, Inc., Washington, DC. In predicting the effectiveness of quieting measures for re- ducing machine-induced structural vibration, it is necessary to know the vibratory output of the machine and the dy- namical properties of both the machine and the supporting structure. In many vibration reduction problems, even if the causes of the vibratory output of the machine are known (e.g., unbalance, combustion processes, friction, fluid flow), the magnitudes of the excitations, their points of applica- tion, and the transfer functions thence to the machine out- put terminals (the mounting points) are unknown; hence, prediction of vibratory output is difficult. It follows that a method for predicting structural vibration, and the effec- tiveness of quieting measures, which would utilize data available at the output terminals of the machine, and input terminals of the supporting structure would be of considera- ble utility. This paper proposes such a method, which makes use of multi-terminal multi-degree-of-freedom me- chanical generalizations of the Thevenin and Norton elec- trical network theorems. The quantities for characterizing the vibratory output of the machine, its dynamical charac- teristics, and the dynamical characteristics of the support- ing structure are defined, and problems in obtaining the required experimental data are briefly discussed. 831435. Multishaker broadband excitation for experimen- tal modal analysis. David L. Hunt, SDRC, Inc., San Diego, CA; and Edward L. Peterson, SDRC, Inc., Milford, OH. A new method of excitation for modal testing is described which combines the benefits of the two most often used techniques: multipoint sine dwell and single-point random. This new method - multishaker broadband excitation - employs an array of shakers to develop multiple sets of frequency response functions, which, as evidenced by their reciprocity and consistency, yield a more accurate represen- 199</page><page sequence="181">831435-831445 tation of the structure's dynamics, resulting in a better mo- dal model. Additionally, this new technology offers a signifi- cant reduction in time required to perform a modal survey. An example application to the space shuttle orbiter Enterprise is described. 1983 SAE Transactions 831438. Uncertainty methodology for in-flight thrust de- termination. G. R.

Elevated temperature aluminum alloys for aero- space applications. I. F. Sakata and S. L. Langen- beck, Lockheed-California Co., Burbank, CA. Highlights of a Lockheed-California Company inhouse ap- plication study and contractual alloy development program conducted by Lockheed for the Air Force Materials Labo- ratory (AFML) are presented. The potential benefits are based on advanced powder metallurgy aluminum alloys with high strength and high stiffness property goals that are competitive with titanium alloy. Applications for use at service temperatures up to 650°F are projected. The aluminum-iron-oxide dispersion hardened systems are cur- rently being developed by the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) and the Pratt and Whitney Aircraft - Government Products Division (P&amp;WA). The alloy devel- opment progress and potential application on a high speed advanced aircraft fighter are summarized. Key issues re- quiring attention in the elevated temperature aluminum al- loy technology development are presented. 831443. Materials properties data base computerization. R. G. Baur, M. L.

All of the properties of the materials used in the design, analysis, and manufacture of jet engines are listed in the seven-volume Material Properties Handbook. Keeping these volumes of curves up-to-date has been a constant challenge, but recently work began to replace the old system of printed volumes with a computerized record that can be accessed from virtually anywhere. This paper is a status report on the project. 831445. (P-132) The use of holographic head-up display of flight path symbology in varying weather condi- tions. G. P. Bouček, T. A. Pfaff, and W. D. Smith, Boeing Commercial Airplane Company, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124. Eleven experienced transport pilots flew a series of instru- ment and visual approaches in a motion-based 737 training simulator with a holographic head-up display (HUD), a head-down flight path display, and conventional instrumen- tation under a variety of visual and turbulence conditions. The objective of this study was to demonstrate and evaluate, under these various environmental and flight con- ditions, a holographic head-up display that uses an inte- grated approach to informative presentations through ad- vanced graphic techniques. The results (based on the performance measures, pilot opinion and rating data, and observer data) include the following: (a) HUD resulted in greater precision than either of the other display types when comparing any of the performance measures; (b) the head- down flight path display resulted in consistently better flight performance than the conventional instruments; (c) HUD resulted in significantly more successful approaches when compared to the other displays; (d) the majority of the pilots felt that the workload was lower with the HUD; 200</page><page sequence="182">831445-831457 and (e) all the pilots felt their approaches were better with the HUD. 1983 SAE Transactions 831446. (P-132) HH-60D helmet mounted display for- mats - a pilot's view and a human factors view. James R. Barney and Richard H. Klippert, Fed- eral Systems Div., IBM Corp., Owego, NY. This paper describes the integration of a helmet mounted display system into the multiple CRT "glass cockpit" being developed for the Air Force HH-60D terrain following, night combat rescue helicopter. For orientation, the loca- tion of units comprising the helmet display system is de- scribed first. Then, since the helmet mounted display for- mats are common with those presented on the four Multi- purpose Displays, the attributes of the formats are detailed by portraying a brief flight as seen through a sequence of those formats. 831448. (P-132) Information processing using helmet mounted displays and voice interactive systems. W. Sidoruk, Grumman Aerospace Corp. Assessment of helmet mounted virtual image display tech- nologies for application to surveillance-type aircraft indi- cates that suitably augmented designs using multiple images and opaque visors can replace large screen displays and improve operator performance in a variety of missions (e.g., electronic warfare, airborne early warning and antisubma- rine warfare). Additional assessment of the benefits of inte- grating voice interactive systems (voice command, voice synthesis) for the above missions indicates that utility is determined by interoperator verbal communication require- ments. In high communication workload situations, total task performance could be degraded. Task situations where virtual image displays and voice interactive system integra- tion can be effectively employed are described. 1983 SAE Transactions 831449.

This paper presents a systematic approach for developing a Heads Up Display (HUD) to be used within the helmet of the Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) crewmember. The in- formation displayed on the EVA HUD will be analogous to EVA Flight Data File (FDF) information, which is an inte- gral part of NASA's current Space Transportation System. Another objective is to determine information requirements and media techniques ultimately leading to the helmet- mounted HUD presentation technique. 1983 SAE Transactions 831451. (P-132) A holographic head-up display for low visibility landing operations. John P. Desmond, Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. A new system has been developed to meet the difficult requirements for aircraft operation in low visibility condi- tions. Unlike automatic systems, this system utilizes and enhances the pilots' flying ability through a holographic head-up display which provides bright, clear information across a wide field of view. The information presented is monitored to ensure probabilities of misleading the pilot to be on the order of one part in 10"8. The system is now undergoing verification tests in a B-727 turbo jet aircraft with the objective to obtain certification for use in CAT Ilia, 700 feet visibility conditions. 1983 SAE Transactions 831455. (P-132) Efforts to assure anthropometric cockpit compatibility in Navy aircraft. Robert E. Hughes and William F. Moroney, Naval Air Test Center, Patuxent River, MD. Every aircraft crewstation has certain anthropometric re- quirements to ensure safe and efficient operability. Inappro- priate assignment of individuals to a particular crewstation can result in aircraft mishaps, ejection injuries, reduced safety margins, and reassignments based on performance difficulties. An improved methodology to quantify the criti- cal anthropometric factors is presented. 831456. (P-132) Testing ground proximity warning sys- tems for Navy tactical aircraft. Fred C. Hoerner, Naval Air Test Center, Patuxent River, MD. Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) accidents in the U.S. Navy have been the cause of a loss in preparedness for many years. The utilization of a commercially developed technology called Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) can help eliminate this type of accident. This pa- per will discuss the past efforts and the planned test activi- ties as the Navy brings this technology into operational utilization. 831457. (P-132) Voice interactive systems technology assessment. J. D. Wetherbee, Naval Air Test Center, Patuxent River, MD. New developments in cockpit displays and integrated weap- ons system avionics have changed military aviation signifi- cantly. The role of the pilot has been altered from that of a skilled manual operator to an executive manager of a computer-driven integrated weapons system. We are ap- proaching a critical threshold of pilot workload with man- ual and visual information-transfer overload. In the Voice Interactive Systems Technology Assess- ment (VISTA) program, we will evaluate technical feasibil- ity and functional utility of voice interactive system in the Navy F/A-18 aircraft. We will perform ground and flight tests in 1984 to evaluate the system incorporated in the mission computer software programs. Many problems are expected to be encountered in the "acoustically-hostile" environment of a military cockpit. However, we must con- tinue to strive for the optimum cockpit design which re- 201</page><page sequence="183">831457-831466 quires minimum pilot workload and we may find that a voice interactive system provides significant advancements toward that goal. 831458. (P-132) Warnings and cautions - are we on the right track? Richard J. O'Hanlon, Naval Air Test Center, Patuxent River, MD. With each new generation of tactical jet aircraft, the num- ber of alerts is increasing. Since cockpit space is at a pre- mium, a system of displaying alerts to the aircrew must be designed and integrated into the airframe. A cost effective method of accomplishing this task includes appointing a panel of pilots to advise the manufacturers about the cock- pit from a user's point of view. In order to reduce distrac- tions to the aircrew during critical combat phases of flight, a scheme of inhibiting alerts should be adopted. The deci- sion concerning which alerts should be inhibited during which phases of flight should be made by the panel of pilots convened by the manufacturer. The final product will be an airplane that will inform the pilot only of the most severe system failures during combat which will allow the mission to be accomplished without unnecessary distractions, thus reducing the crew's workload. 831459. (P-132) Improving the operator interface through use of a touch interactive display. Thomas M. McKannon and Carole A. Bohn, Naval Air Test Center, Patuxent River, MD. The rapid growth of technology has allowed development of systems which are limited not by the processing capabili- ties of the sensors but by the quality of the information presented to the operator for control and analysis. Such systems are either enhanced or degraded based on the de- sign of the human interface. Additionally, the speed of growth in the technologies has resulted in a need for a faster weapons system development cycle or improved response to the rapidly changing threat environment. This is achieved by capitalizing on the flexibility inherent in newer, software driven systems. The operator interface for such systems must also demonstrate a similar flexibility. These problems have been attacked by the Navy's Long Range Maritime Patrol community through the use of Integrated Control Panels (ICP's) as replacements for existing and proposed standard knob-and-dial control panels. The ICP's consist of a small plasma panel with a touch sensitive overlay. This permits the panel to function as both a display unit and a control unit. This paper discusses the use of the ICP ap- proach for an enhancement to the acoustic processing sys- tem and an integration of a new Electronic Surveillance Measures (ESM) System into the P-3C aircraft. Both sys- tems are compared to the same systems implemented with conventional technology. The paper deals only with existing systems in actual flight test. The constraints of these addi- tions are described and the evaluation results discussed. Additionally, the relative advantages and disadvantages of the ICP approach for future development are presented. 831462. (P-132) Methods and instrumentation for evalua- tion of advanced displays and pilot performance. G. P. Bouček, T. A. Pfaff, and W. D. Smith, Boeing Commercial Airplane Company, Seattle, WA. Advances in technology have continuously provided new flight capabilities. Along with these new capabilities have come new demands on the flight crew. Pilots are now seeing a greater percentage of flight tasks being performed by automatic systems; however, data handling and integration tasks have reached new heights that now require more pilot attention. The pilot's changing role creates a greater burden on the system design and evaluation process, which is used to ensure the man-machine interface operates at satisfactory levels. Discussed in this paper are various methods for eval- uating this interface at the different levels of system design. 831465. (P-132) Flight management - the real man ma- chine interface. Noel Hudson, Crew Systems De- velopment Branch, AFWAL/FIGR, WPAFB, OH; and William Young, Control Systems Devel- opment Branch, AFWAL/FIGL, WPAFB, OH. The man-machine interface is commonly thought of as the controls and displays in the cockpit or crew stations of an aircraft. The authors contend that the real interface will lie deep within the computers of tomorrow's aircraft, both in the control algorithms and in the software driving the dis- plays. This paper describes the authors' approach to design- ing a flight management system and shows how such a system could be used, in a mission context. 831466. (P-132) The scientific approach and cockpit de- sign - they are compatible. Richard W. Moss and Noel Hudson, Crew Systems Development Branch, AFWAL/FIGR, WPAFB, OH. The authors present a frame work - the scientific approach - within which they suggest the currently in use techniques and processes associated with advanced crew system design, should be used. They advocate considering the cockpit and crew as components of a "Crew System", an entity which must be responsive to requirements and needs the same way the more traditional systems must be responsive to require- ments and needs. They strongly urge improved communica- tions with the user and suggest increased activity be ex- pended on the definition of the problem - what is the mission, and how does the User anticipate performing it? The use of various test facilities, ranging in sophistication from simple mockups to flight test aircraft, is discussed, with specific recommendations made as to how these test facilities should be used. Finally, they urge sustained first hand involvement of the user throughout the process - con- firming mission requirements, exploring design alternatives and testing design concepts. 202</page><page sequence="184">831467-831473 831467.

Hawkins and John M. Reis- ing, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH; and James D. Gilmour, Boeing Military Airplane Co., Seattle, WA. This paper discusses a series of studies in which the objec- tive is to develop advanced methods of information transfer for the pilots of high performance fighter aircraft. Tradi- tional cockpit designs have resulted in aircraft where there are more controls and displays in the crew compartment than a human operator can effectively deal with. Develop- ment of more efficient means of communication between aircraft and aircrew is an absolute necessity for survival in future high threat environments. This paper addresses some new displays that have been evaluated for that purpose. 1983 SAE Transactions 831469. (P-132) Predictive controller issues for trajectory control. Michael W. Bird, Lear Siegler Inc./In- strument Div.; and Robert Schneble, Lear Siegler Inc./Astronics Div. An advanced trajectory control system is defined for opera- tion in the 1990's. Basic functions of trajectory control are the selection and control of the aircraft trajectory. For the 1990's, the system needs to operate on all available knowl- edge of the mission and environment. It needs to use this knowledge and the full maneuvering capabilities of the air- craft for responding to unexpected events during the mis- sion, including control resource reconfiguration in the presence of failures. Decision, estimation, and control tech- nologies must be integrated to provide these advanced capa- bilities. Identified as key to this integration are Artificial Intelligence and predictive path control technologies. These technologies and their potential application in trajectory control systems are discussed. Flight safety and system ro- bustness are established as issues that need to be addressed early in the trajectory control system development. 831471. (P-132) Advanced cockpit design for multi-role fighter avionics integration. Dennis A. Leu- thauser, 6510 Test Wing/TEVF, USAF, Edwards AFB, CA. The advances in avionics technology have dictated new approaches in cockpit design to enhance the single-seat fighter pilot's ability to perform complex mission tasks. One such cockpit under development and test is in the F-16C/D aircraft scheduled for production delivery to the Tactical Air Forces in late 1984. This paper discusses the require- ments for new cockpit designs, the F-16C/D cockpit, and the impacts of the pilot-aircraft interface on mission per- formance. The purpose of this paper is to outline the advances in Avionics Systems technology which have led to the require- ment to integrate more and more of these advanced systems into today's fighter aircraft. Because of the sheer number of systems being integrated, it became obvious that conven- tional cockpit arrangements of the past were inadequate to handle the controls and displays required for the pilot to successfully fly the aircraft, operate all the systems and complete his mission. Fortunately, these same technology advances have al- lowed today's aircraft designers a great deal of flexibility in optimizing new cockpit configurations to enhance the pi- lot's ability to perform complex mission tasks. General Dynamics is currently developing a new cockpit design for production in the F-16C/D aircraft. Several preproduction aircraft with the advanced cockpit are currently undergoing developmental test and evaluation by the F-16 Combined Test Force at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Although the entire avionics suite has not matured to allow total system capability, Air Force pilots have formu- lated some initial impressions of the cockpit design and the pilot-aircraft interface. 831472. (P-132) F-15 dual role fighter cockpit integration. David C. Spencer, USAF, 6510 Test Wing, Ed- wards AFB, CA. This paper briefly describes the background to the design, the process used in designing, and the "missionized" crew station designs of the F-15 Dual Role Fighter (DRF). The McDonnell Aircraft Company (McAir) had begun an Ad- vanced Fighter Capability Demonstrator program to de- velop and demonstrate an enhanced air-to-ground capabil- ity in the F-15 years before the USAF identified the need for a DRF. This experience, plus a closely coordinated effort between McAir and USAF personnel, and extensive use of a high-fidelity simulator have resulted in F-15 DRF crew station designs that afford both tremendous flexibility and capability. 831473. (P-132) Using the peripheral vision horizon dis- play. Thomas V. Tilden, US Air Force. The Peripheral Vision Horizon Display (PVHD) uses a laser to project a line parallel to the horizon on the instru- ment panel. This device, conceived by Dr. Richard Mal- colm, reinforces spatial orientation subconsciously through peripheral vision. At first, pilots find the display distracting. Eventually, pilots learn to ignore the line, but the subconscious orient- ing effect remains. Display interpretation is more natural in roll than in pitch. 203</page><page sequence="185">831473-831483 Provisions for preventing disorientation through pe- ripheral vision inputs should be considered for future air- craft.

Kast, Aircraft Engine Business Group, General Electric Co. A backup control has been defined for a contemplated vari- able cycle engine where the primary control is digital elec- tronic. The digital electronic unit controls the many vari- ables so that all the available engine performance is achieved. The backup control provides "get home" ability, smooth transfer action, minimum interference during pri- mary digital control operation, engine overspeed and over- temperature protection and a low power loss failure rate. A hydromechanical approach was selected because of its dem- onstrated high levels of reliability in main engine controls and to avoid common mode failures such as those induced by lightning and EMI/EMP. Transfer action is initiated upon loss of electrical power, loss of primary control "good health", overspeed or by pilot action. 831476. Full authority digital control for a small turbine helicopter engine. Stan Janik, Engine Accesso- ries, AVCO Lycoming Div., Stratford, Ct. A second-generation full authority digital electronic control has been developed for small turbine engines in helicopter applications. The device is functionally complex, featuring adaptive control techniques, fault-tolerant design and self- diagnostics. Yet, a highly reliable design is maintained us- ing high-level electronics integration, simple mechanical in- terface and a sophisticated computer software language. Control system development and F.A.A. certification test- ing, including the results of a rigorous flight test program, are documented. 831477.

Electronic fuel controls for executive jet aircraft. J. J. Fredlake and M. R. Adams, Garrett Turbine Engine Co., Phoenix, Az. Garrett full-authority electronic fuel control systems have been in service on executive type jet aircraft since 1972 and have accumulated over five million flight hours. This paper presents the merits, design features and evolution of analog through digital full-authority electronic control systems coupled with their flexibility in adding new functions. 831480. Extraordinary benefits of Combined Environ- mental Reliability Testing (CERT) on digital electronic engine controls. V. G. Mosca, Hamil- ton Standard Division, United Technologies Cor- poration, Windsor Locks, Connecticut. Combined Environment Reliability Testing (CERT) has been completed for a military and commercial jet engine mounted digital electronic fuel control application. CERT testing has revealed several failure modes not normally identified by traditional development, qualification and burn-in testing. This paper discusses the manifestation and corrective action of these failure modes and identifies sev- eral secondary anomalies that were discovered during re- pair actions or deliberate inspections. These anomalies, al- though not directly responsible for a control malfunction, could eventually have caused a control removal. CERT tests on two different engine controls have high- lighted meaningful comparative results that tend to verify initial reliability predictions. Analysis of test data has also indicated potential improvements in future CERT testing to yield more cost effective results. Lastly, this paper presents the benefit of real time CERT testing by virtue of excellent propulsion control reliability being realized by airline reve- nue service. 831482. A design approach to integrated flight and pro- pulsion control. Dinesh S. Joshi, Peter D. Shaw, and John Hodgkinson, Northrop Aircraft Divi- sion; Steven M. Rock and James H. Vincent, Systems Control Technology; and William S. Fisk, General Electric Company. A decentralized, multivariable controls methodology is be- ing developed for the functional integration of a fighter's aerodynamic controls with those of its propulsion system (inlet, engine, and thrust vectoring/reversing nozzle). Inte- grated controls account for, and take advantage of the sig- nificant cross-coupling between these system elements. A high-fidelity, six-degrees-of-freedom (6 DOF) aircraft sim- ulation has been developed, incorporating advanced tactical fighter features such as variable cycle engines, variable ge- ometry inlets, 2D-CD TV/TR nozzles, canards and a pro- pulsive lift concept. A comprehensive evaluation test plan, including a piloted simulation, has been developed to vali- date this integrated-controls design methodology. Prelimi- nary results show significant benefits of integrated control in terms of enhanced aircraft maneuverability, precise flight path control, reduced pilot workload, and fault tolerant system design. 1983 SAE Transactions 831483. Development of control surface actuation sys- tems on various configurations of the F-16. Bruce S. Lyle, General Dynamics Corp., Fort Worth Div. 204</page><page sequence="186">831483-831489 The development of the F-16 flight control system (FCS) had definite impacts on the design of the primary control surface actuation devices. The YF-16 employed one of the first aircraft fly-by-wire (FBW) control systems. One of the challenges of the YF-16 FCS design was to use existing state-of-the-art components with little or no development required yet provide the necessary redundancy and reliabil- ity levels needed for a fly-by-wire system. The FSD and production F-16 programs allowed for the development of an integrated servoactuator (ISA) for use on the primary control surfaces. This ISA design com- bined the command servo and power actuator functions and allowed all types of actuator inputs to be summed electri- cally. The AFTI/F-16 airplane presented some unique re- quirements due to the implementation of a digital FBW system. Twin vertical canards meant additional actuation requirements. 1983 SAE Transactions 831484. Development of redundant flight control actua- tion systems for the F/A-18 strike fighter. H. E.

The MC AIR approach to meeting the F/A-18 flight control system actuator redundancy requirements is presented. The actuator configurations, servoloops, and redundancy man- agement concepts are described. Early interface compatibil- ity and redundancy management testing of breadboard hardware were used to identify potential problem areas be- fore iron bird testing of flight worthy hardware.

The B-l is a long-range strategic bomber designed to per- form safely in a hostile environment with a high probability of mission success. The flight control system achieves these objectives with redundant hybrid combinations of fly-by- wire and conventional design techniques. The primary mode of control in each axis is fail-operational, fail-safe, fly-by-wire with simultaneously operating mechanical con- trol. The flight control system is described, and selected flight and ground test experiences and resultant develop- ment activity are discussed. Developments include reduc- tion of force fight in surfaces with multiple actuators, re- duction of horizontal stabilizer control hysteresis, elimination of pitch control/structural mode coupling, re- duction in lower rudder load oscillations, increase in the operational reliability of the flap/slat system, elimination of the susceptibility of the augmentation system to electrical power transients, and other items. 1983 SAE Transactions 831486. Future flight control capability development. E. H. Flinn, Wright Patterson Air Force Base. The future of the Air Force tactical and strategic forces will depend upon the ability of the future fighter-bomber to be able to effectively penetrate enemy defenses, kill the targets and survive while at the same time being easily supportable in the field. That future technology is now being matured in the exploratory development program of the Aeronautical Systems Division, Flight Dynamics Laboratory, Flight Control Division and is aimed at providing options for the solutions to the requirements of the Air Force such as avoiding detection, increasing the probability of finding and destroying targets with multiple kills per pass, having en- hanced crew capability and improved force availability. These technologies will give the future fighter-bomber the capability for night all-weather autonomous operation thus enabling the pilot of the future to quickly kill targets with increased survivability, while at the same time being easily supportable at high sortie rates in the field. 831487.

The Boeing 767 hydraulic system. A. W. Water- man, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. The hydraulic system for the new Boeing 767 twin-jet transport operates the fully powered flight control surfaces, secondary control surfaces for high lift, and utility actua- tion systems. The use of three independent distribution systems provides safety and reliability exceeding the latest Federal requirements. The system design enhances cus- tomer affordability of the airplane by utilizing major com- ponents that are common with those on other commercial airplanes and qualified for long life expectancy. System op- eration is controlled to respond to on-demand requirements for flow and isolate utilities during cruise to minimize prime power extraction. The effectiveness of the system has been proven by extensive flight testing that demonstrated com- pliance with all design requirements proving the system to rate the distinction as a design model for the future. 1983 SAE Transactions 831489.

B. Billet, Hydro Products Inc., San Diego, CA. The past decade has shown a dramatic increase in the use of unmanned tethered vehicles in worldwide marine fields. These are used for inspection, debris removal and object retrieval. The RCV-150 system is an example of these advanced technology vehicles. With the requirements of high ma- neuverability and unusual inspection a responsive, high per- formance, compact hydraulic system was developed. The hydraulic system is powered by an electric motor- driven pump which provides hydraulic power to the four thruster motors and to the five-function manipulator work arm. 831492. Nacelle design for Grumman Design 698 V/STOL. C. Lehman and V. Crafa, Grumman Aerospace Corporation. Grumman's Design 698 V/STOL is configured to perform multi-mission military roles, including ASW, AEW and Missileer. The aircraft employs a unique V/STOL design, which places all control for hover and transition in the twin turbofan nacelles. This paper presents design and develop- ment of the aircraft propulsion system, covering a span of seven years. Initial developmental testing concentrated on two of the key components of the nacelle, the inlet and the control vane assembly. Isolated testing was used to establish baseline designs which eventually were adapted to a TF34 engine for a full scale powered model test of a proposed manned flight demonstrator at the Ames Research Center. During this test, the nacelle design was proven over a range of hover and transition operating conditions. Also included in this paper are discussions of the continued design efforts at Grumman to optimize the demonstrator configuration. 831493. Cross-ducted propulsion systems for medium- speed V/STOL applications. E. R. Glasgow, W. E. Beck, and J. G. Carlson, Lockheed-California Company, Burbank, Calif. Multiengine vertical takeoff and landing (V/STOL) aircraft have a unique requirement to at least maintain aircraft trim after losing one engine during vertical landing. The most popular scheme by which this is accomplished involves us- ing cross-shafted fans with variable inlet guide vanes. A significantly different approach is described herein whereby cross-ducted fan bleed air is used to obtain roll control and engine out roll trim. The installation of this cross-ducted system in a twin-engine V/STOL aircraft is described in detail along with different options for obtaining pitch con- trol, pitch trim and yaw control. The optimum engine cycle for each configuration is defined based on mission perform- ance results and vertical landing capabilities. The cross- ducted systems were found to offer significant advantages compared to the cross-shafted systems in terms of aircraft performance as well as design simplicity, versatility, relia- bility, vulnerability, survivability, and safety. 831494. Medium speed V/STOL propulsion installation losses - comparison of prediction and model test data. T. W. Clingingsmith, Vought Corp. A medium speed V/STOL aircraft has been configured using a tandem fan propulsion system concept. Each tan- dem fan nacelle has two unique inlets and nozzles. Isolated and combined inlet tests were conducted at NASA Lewis. Compatible inlet operation was established with beneficial interaction occurring between the inlets resulting in im- proved total pressure recovery. Isolated nozzle tests have also been conducted by NASA Lewis. The front nozzle test was preceeded by parametric nozzle tests at Vought to es- tablish the baseline configuration. Results from both static and low speed tests have consistently shown better than predicted performance for both inlets and nozzles. 831496. The hybrid fan vectored thrust engine. B. D. Ward, Rolls-Royce Inc., Atlanta, Georgia; and C. J. Penrose, Rolls-Royce Limited, Bristol, Eng- land. A propulsion system concept with particular application to supersonic short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) figh- ter/attack aircraft has been developed. The concept com- prises a variable cycle engine, combining the advantages of a vectored thrust turbofan for takeoff, landing, and sub- sonic flight with those of a mixed augmented turbofan for high performance and supersonic flight. The system incor- porates features and characteristics which have proved both practical and successful on the AV-8 (Harrier), and is po- tentially an attractive solution. 831497.

(P-132) Training pilots in the area of judgement, decision making and cockpit management. R. E. Norman, Jr., Air Line Pilots Association. The National Aviation System in this country is composed of a number of interrelated parts. The pilot must be prop- erly selected and adequately trained to function safely wi- thin this system. Such training must give the individual pilot the proper tools to adequately handle aircraft emer- gencies and manage those resources available within the cockpit. Training should also provide a system feedback loop through accident and incident investigation to assure that training is realistic and system deficiencies or opera- tions are made known. 831499. (P-132) Pilot judgment - an operational view- point. R. B. Stone, G. L. Babcock, and W. W. Edmunds, Jr., Air Line Pilots Association. The process of decision making is poorly understood in our aviation environment. Accidents may demonstrate in- stances where incorrect decisions were made but current investigative techniques do not necessarily give a clear un- derstanding of why such decisions were made. The elements of the decision making process need to be better understood so proper attention may be given to pilot training and devel- oping operational procedures. A study of the Aviation Safety Reporting System data base was conducted to gain a better understanding of the actual operational impact of decision making. 831501. (P-132) A philosophy of automation. W. W. Mel- vin, Air Line Pilots Association. The use of automatic systems to reduce operator workload and improve performance must be carefully monitored to ensure that the master/servant relationship is properly pre- served and that human operators are in fact in command. Critical decision-making functions must not be automated away from a commander's control, nor should he be ex- posed to uncertainty and frustration from not knowing what an automatic system is doing. The role of automatic systems relating to the piloting of aircraft is examined to illustrate both the proper and improper use of automatic systems, and the addition to transport aircraft of flight- critical functions which can be controlled only by auto- matic systems is questioned. 831504.

Air- man certification requirements, specified in the Federal Aviation Regulations, are expressed in behavioral terms. Distinctions between simulator uses for training, evalua- tion, and gaining operational experience are discussed.

Standards do not just happen. They have to be planned, written, accepted, and (most important) used; in other words, they have to be sold. The selling process is more difficult for international standards than for standards in- tended only for domestic use. For the former, many more people have to agree to define the goals and procedures involved than for the latter. The people, companies, socie- ties, associations, and governments involved cannot be co- erced. Conflicting interests, technical, commercial, and na- tional, somehow have to be reconciled. This paper discusses the need for international aerospace standards and some of the factors involved in gaining their acceptance. 831511. Status report on aerospace metrication. Alfred Peterson, Boeing Aerospace Co. Following passage of PL 94-168, the transition to the use of metric units within the United States has been very slow. The lack of a national plan with no clear understanding or agreement concerning the source of the funds required to effect the transition have been major impediments. There are international pressures from the international standards-making organizations, the ICAO and NATO, to proceed with the unification of standards. Within the com- mercial aviation field, the United States is resisting the 207</page><page sequence="189">831511 -831518 pressure, but is participating in international standardiza- tion activities because of a general recognition of the need to support future market requirements and to assist in the reso- lution of a significant NATO logistics problem. The AIA, with the SAE and other standards-making organizations, is attempting to secure a harmonization of United States and AECMA metric standards. The future transition progress is not expected to accelerate significantly until metric stan- dards are available. 1983 SAE Transactions 831512. Executive summary of progress in international aerospace standards in ISO-TC/20. John F. Tor- mey, ISO/TC-20. Creation and promulgation of international standards for aircraft and space vehicles is the charge of Technical Com- mittee No. 20 (TC-20) of the International Organization of Standardization (ISO). With 14 nations participating, TC-20 has produced over 100 standards. Paper describes the policies and operations of TC-20, and discusses issues of jurisdiction, participation, rate of generation, and de facto international standards. 831513. How aerospace ISO standards will impact new designs SC-1 electrical requirements. David Blyther, Douglas Aircraft Co. The work of Sub-Committee SC-1 "Aerospace Electrical Requirements" of ISO Committee TC-20 "Aircraft and Space Vehicles" in international standardization is de- scribed and related to other organizations working in this field. The manner in which the USA consensus position on the various work items is established by the related USA sub-committee advisory group (SCAG-1) in coordination with other national organizations is related. Some of the impediments encountered are enumerated. The chronology of SC-l's standardization procedure is mentioned as are some of its achievements. 831515. The impact of ISO/TC20/SC9, air cargo and ground equipment standards on new aircraft de- sign. Ray V. Riggs, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co., Seattle, WA. This paper deals with specific standards related to air cargo equipment and systems and associated ground equipment produced by ISO/TC20/Subcommittee 9 and why these standards must be recognized in configurating cargo air- craft of the future. Emphasis is placed on standards for cargo unit load devices, i.e., containers (especially the 8 X 8 ft size), pallets, nets and the associated loading equipment as to their role in affecting aircraft design. Various concepts for the wide-body cargo airplane of the future are also ex- plored. 1983 SAE Transactions 831516. How aerospace international standards will im- pact new design - fluid systems, ISO/TC20/SC 10. Hans van der Velden, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. One hundred and thirty metric aerospace (MA) fluid sys- tem standards and specifications are being prepared by vari- ous SAE committees; twenty have been released after ten years of work in international standards. Other benefits of U.S. participation in International Standards Organization (ISO) work and the organization of the U.S. Advisory Group involved are discussed. The AIR 2000 index for metric fluid system standards and the use of MA standards are described. 831517. Aerodynamic effects of moveable sidewall nozzle geometry and rotor exit restriction on the per- formance of a radial turbine. C. Rogo and T. Hajek, Teledyne CAE, Toledo, Ohio; and R. Roelke, NASA Lewis Research Center. A high work capacity radial inflow turbine with a known performance base was modified to accept a combination of moveable nozzle sidewalls, diffusing or acceleration rotor inlet ramps and rotor exit restriction rings. The overall performance of this variable geometry turbine was meas- ured at constant speed and pressure ratio for thirty-one (31) different test configurations. Data were obtained over a nozzle area range of 50 to 100 percent of maximum. The nozzle area was varied by moving both the for- ward and rearward sidewalls of the nozzle assembly. A comparison of the overall performance of this concept with a variable stagger angle vane concept shows that the use of a moveable sidewall for area control is a viable alternative option. Air leakage between the nozzle vane and moveable sidewall were found to affect performance significantly and are a factor to be minimized in any given practical applica- tion. This paper presents the results of the experimental investigation and provides an aerodynamic data base for a variable geometry radial turbine utilizing a moveable side- wall nozzle. 1983 SAE Transactions 831518. Small turbine technology: challenges in the 809s. Francis W. Yep, Ronald E. Dennis, and William M. Gordon, The Garrett Turbine Engine Com- pany, Phoenix, AZ. There is a need to further improve the performance and cost of small turbine engines. This can best be achieved by designing a more efficient turbine hot section (combustor and turbine) that incorporates advancements in turbine aerodynamics, heat transfer, mechanical design, and mate- rial technology. Recent accomplishments include (1) development of advanced 3-D design methods; (2) better understanding of the flow physics associated with cooling air discharge, gas path leakage, tip leakage, and disk cavity discharge; and (3) 208</page><page sequence="190">831518-831524 advancement in material technology and fabrication tech- niques. These accomplishments have led to efficient high heat-release-rate combustors and efficient, highly loaded turbines to improve the engine performance, reliability, and weight without jeopardizing the life of the components. New technologies are required and should be developed for the remainder of this decade in response to the demand for further improvements in engine performance and cost. 831519. Composite casting/bonding construction of an air-cooled, high temperature radial turbine wheel. Alvin N. Hammer, Georges Aigret, Colin Rodg- ers, and Arthur G. Metcalfe, Solar Turbines Inc., San Diego, CA. This paper addresses the design and fabrication of a high temperature radial turbine wheel constructed by a compos- ite casting/bonding technique. Areas discussed include aerodynamic analyses; the design of blade internal passages for cooling the dual turbine wheel (star wheel and exducer) in a 2800°F (1810K) TIT service environment; the proce- dure for producing the castings; and the fabrication of cool- ing passages by a "split blade" technique in which the inter- nal details are constructed independently from sheet metal and sintered powder and are subsequently HIP-bonded wi- thin the wheels. 1983 SAE Transactions 831520. Ceramic application in gas turbine engines. L. C. Lindgren, P. W. Heitman, and S. R. Thrasher, Allison Gas Turbine Operations, GMC. Structural ceramic gas turbine components have been de- signed, fabricated and tested in the CATE (Ceramic Appli- cation in Turbine Engines) and AGT (Advanced Gas Tur- bine) programs. This paper describes the work on ceramic turbine vanes in the CATE Program and shows the planned near-term utilization of this technology in production en- gines. Ceramic radial turbine rotor design and development work in the AGT 100 program and the possible future application of this rotor in an advanced cruise missile en- gine are also discussed. 1983 SAE Transactions 831521. (P-132) Three-dimensional digitization of real world objects. J. T. Scully, Polhemus Navigation Sciences Div., McDonnell Douglas Electronics Co., Essex Junction, VT, A Division of McDon- nell Douglas Corp. An electromagnetic position and orientation measurement system has been developed that constantly measures the three-dimensional coordinates of a moving sensor in rela- tion to a fixed source. The system employs two modules, each consisting of three small coils forming an orthogonal triad. One module acts as a fixed source to generate an electromagnetic field, while the other module acts as a movable sensor to sample the field. An electronics unit performs all computing and interfacing functions. As a Digitizer, the system is used to input real world, three-dimensional objects to a database, and to input the coordinates of engineering models to a computer for gener- ation of isometric drawings and material takeoff lists. In its Piping System configuration, the unit eliminates the need for manual measurement of model coordinates. By touching a point to be measured with the stylus, coordinate data points are automatically transferred to a host or a commer- cially available microcomputer for storage. 831522. (P-132) The readability of liquid crystal displays for helicopter cockpit applications: effects of backlighting with electroluminescence. Robert L. Hilgendorf, Randall E. Johnson, and Randy L. Jobe, Midland-Ross Corp., Grimes Div. Results are presented regarding the effects of backlighting liquid crystal displays (LCD's) by electroluminescent (EL) lamps and the effects of general ambient lighting. The inter- est in LCD's with EL backlighting stems from this display concept's compatibility with night vision goggles (NVG's). The results indicate that increased backlighting enhances transflective dichroic LCD readability in contrast to an earlier study utilizing a reflective LCD which concluded that backlighting has an adverse effect. 831523. (P-132) Integrated voice controls and speech displays for rotorcraft mission management. Ca- rol A. Simpson, Psycho-Linguistic Research Associates, Menlo Park, CA. This paper first reviews computer voice recognition and speech generation technology in the context of potential rotorcraft applications and summarizes the aviation human factors research that has been accomplished in these two closely related technologies. An argument is then made for an integrated approach to research and development and subsequent design of voice control and speech display sys- tems for rotorcraft missions. Finally, comes a list of human factors issues that need to be addressed in order to take an integrated approach to rotorcraft voice systems design. 1983 SAE Transactions 831524. (P-132) The Cyclo-Crane - a hybrid aircraft con- cept. A. G. Crimmins, AeroLift, Inc. AeroLift represents one of the very few organizations de- voted to the design, development, and construction of a hybrid aircraft. The proposed Cyclo-Crane is a hybrid air- craft that utilizes aerostatic lift combined with aerodynamic lift and thrust. The Cyclo-Crane will offer heavy lift ser- vices, analogous to helicopter operations at a cost projected to be on the order of 25% of helicopters. The Cyclo-Crane concept is valid up to 75 tons of slingload capability with the initial models targeted at the two and 16-ton slingload range. 209</page><page sequence="191">831526-831536 831526. (P-132) Man/machine; man/man, or Murphy's Law revisited. Jerome F. Lederer, Flight Safety Foundation, Inc. The mistakes of humans, whether in design, construction or operation of modern technological systems, are likely to occur in the most unexpected circumstances. The author discusses examples of accidents or mishaps due to human errors in design, training and management as well as possi- ble solutions. New opportunities for hazard have appeared in the form of human abuse of legal and illegal drugs as they may alter the predictability of human behavior. As the reliability of systems increases, human operators are faced with dull monitoring tasks and boredom, while the remote risk of failure can have catastrophic consequences. 831529. (P-132) The life style keys to flight deck perform- ance of the Naval aviator - another window. Frank E. Dully, Jr., Naval Aerospace Medical Institute, Naval Air Station, Pensacola, FL. This paper presents the views of a Naval Flight Surgeon on the coping mechanisms that the Naval Aviator brings to his occupation. It develops the theme that four life style char- acteristics necessarily receive inordinate polishing, and that the aviator's continued safety is dependent on his ability to fully exploit all four of these in concert. When one of the four is flawed, he is in jeopardy. Also identified in the paper are five built-in defects present in the healthy aviator that require that he be protected from these, both by his own recurring awareness and by concerted institutional meas- ures. Implicit in the complexity of modern military aircraft is that they are designed for the aviator whose described characteristics are forever uncompromised. The engineer is wrong who believes that the capabilities of the aviator who will fly his creation are static, or that these capabilities are always tweaked to the maximum. 831530. (P-132) Communications - major human factor in cockpit design. J. J. Speyer and A. P. Fort, Flight Division, Airbus Industrie, France. Civilization and culture are converging toward the age of communication. Be it through the prospect of integrated national information networks or through the development of elaborated work stations such as office desks or aircraft cockpits, our present world seems to put a focus on the aspects of information transfer. Today's industrial approach is indeed to engineer and manage integrated communica- tions, yet man's memory can tell how essential they have always been for successful interfaces. The present paper presents AIRBUS INDUSTRIE dedicated philosophy with respect to new cockpit technology in view of high quality communications. More and more it is recognized that these are at the heart of the matter in human factor issues. 1983 SAE Transactions 831532. (P-132) The touch-sensitive control/display unit: a promising computer interface. Michael A. Biferno and Donald L. Stanley, Douglas Aircraft Co. Installation of a touch-sensitive control/display unit (touch-CDU) could improve the operational reliability of future aircraft cockpits, providing that basic human factors issues are addressed early in the development phase of this device. The touch-CDU could be implemented with elec- tronic displays to help: (1) reduce peak workload levels, (2) improve situational awareness, (3) improve the mental set of command and control over the process of flight, (4) reduce the number of controls outside of the optimum eye- hand envelope, (5) reduce crew error due to data-entry, (6) encourage cockpit designers to employ a systems approach. Although the technology exists to implement touch-CDUs in aircraft, several problem areas need to be studied: (1) the effects of turbulence, (2) glare and reflections, (3) cockpit location and orientation to the operator, (4) electronic dis- play formats compatible with touch-entry activities. It is concluded that touch-CDUs offer a promising man/ma- chine interface for aircraft cockpits, provided that adequate developmental testing is performed. 831533. (P-132) Primary flight display: a step beyond EADI's. Leland G. Summers and John I. Miller, Douglas Aircraft Co. Recent advances in commercial flight deck technology have changed flight displays from electromechanical instruments to computer driven, high brightness, multicolor cathode ray tubes (CRT's). The electronic attitude director indicator (EADI) has evolved into a primary flight display (PFD) which integrates attitude, flight director, air data, and flight mode annunciation into one display. The advantages and disadvantages of the PFD concept are discussed. The devel- opment of the PFD is discussed and the progress at Doug- las Aircraft Company is presented to illustrate some of the problems and issues associated with PFD development. Future requirements for the PFD are discussed including compatibility with the head-up display, a microwave land- ing system flight director, time critical alerts, and flight guidance information. The conclusion is drawn that through an evolutionary design process the PFD equipped commercial transports have the potential to provide an im- proved man-machine interface. 1983 SAE Transactions 831536. The Joint Services Advanced Vertical Lift Air- craft (JVX) propulsion system. James A. Ray, U.S. Army Aviation Research and Development Command. The Joint Services Advanced Vertical Lift Aircraft (JVX) is intended to provide the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Ma- rine Corps the ability to conduct combat, combat support and combat service support missions requiring vertical takeoff and landing capabilities not currently available. This 210</page><page sequence="192">831536-831543 multi-service and multi-mission application aircraft will maintain as much commonality as possible in meeting these objectives. This paper addresses the features and develop- ment of the propulsion system associated with the JVX. 831537. Tilt rotor technology thrusts. John P. Magee, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA. This paper provides an overview of the results of on-going research investigations associated with the XV- 15 program. The XV- 15 data and an understanding of the technological elements that go into tilt rotor design can provide a series of benchmark points from which to proceed with new design. The work to refine our estimates of vertical-lift perform- ance, the influence of airframe aerodynamics, and the work planned to establish rotor-limiting flight conditions are discussed. An initial look at short takeoff and landing (STOL) performance is provided and the lessons learned and on-going work in aeroelastic testing and data handling is described. Structural loads and stability and control systems work which have applicability to new design efforts are also shown. The paper concludes with some ideas for longer-range generic investigations to advance the state of the art. 1983 SAE Transactions 831539. F404 engine reliability program. Albert L. Sell- ing, General Electric Co. The U.S. Navy placed reliability high on their list of priori- ties for the F404 engine. A tough set of reliability require- ments were established, together with an incentive award program aimed at encouraging and rewarding reliability achievement. The F404 reliability program was structured to sup- port progress toward meeting the goals. It was aimed at early identification of potential problems, measurement of progress, and ensuring rapid corrective action where need- ed. The program included early and detailed analysis with feedback into the design process. Trade studies considered total life cycle cost impact and were aimed at selection of cost effective design alternatives. Progress was measured frequently against tracking curves which were established for critical components and subsystems as well as for the overall engine. F404 engine reliability has been demonstrated to be better than goal value at each major measurement point. 831540. An F-18 Hornet maintainability and reliability program. Maurice DeVlieger, Sundstrand Service Corp., Unit of Sundstrand Corp. This paper describes a cooperative program for improved collection of maintainability information on Sundstrand products supplied for the F-18 Hornet. The maintainability and reliability data collected will provide information from product removal through depot overhaul/repair analysis and resultant verification of removal cause. The disassem- bly and analysis for removal cause will assist in determining if enhanced maintainability training, corrective action, or modification for the products is required. 831541. Designing reliability into an air turbine starter. S. W. Trimble and W. E. Schmidt, Garrett Pneu- matic Systems, Division of The Garrett Corp. Reliability is designed into an air turbine starter (ATS) by using a trade study model that accounts for time-dependent as well as random failure modes. An evaluation technique, based on the Weibull reliability distribution, that yields answers in terms of system mean time between failure, MTBF, is presented. A sample ATS design typical of those used for commercial jet aircraft main engine starting is analyzed. The resulting system MTBF agrees well with field data on similar units. The analysis also indicates that there is the potential for weight, envelope, and cost savings by redesigning the gears and bearings with respect to fatigue for a higher probability of failure with little effect on overall starter reliability. 1983 SAE Transactions 831542. Weibull/Weibayes analysis of hydraulic pump malfunction data. C. H. Medlin, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft-GPD; and F. L. Elsaesser, Mature En- gine Fuel Systems. Premature wearout of augmentor hydraulic fuel pumps was being experienced in service on a fighter aircraft engine. The removal times ranged from 150 to 800 engine operating hours. Considerable effort had gone into the understanding of the physics of failure and overcoming this problem in a modified pump. However, there still remained the question of how best to proof test the new pump. The challenge was to demonstrate that the redesigned pump was significantly better than the old pump. The problems faced during design verification will be discussed in this case study. For example, does an acceler- ated test duplicate the service failure mode? When has an accelerated test run long enough to prove the redesign is in fact better than the old product? This paper illustrates the application of new technology to solve these research and development program problems through the use of Weibull and Weibayes Analysis. 831543. (P-132) Integrated modelling approaches in ad- vanced cockpit automation. Azad Madni, Percep- tronics. With advances in display and control methods and recent developments in sensor and microelectronic technologies, the term automation, especially as it pertains to the cockpit of a tactical aircraft, has taken on a totally new dimension. No longer are we restricted to automation as it pertains to solely flight management functions. Functions such as real- time situation assessment, tactics selection and trajectory control are all candidates for partial or total automation. In addition, adaptive vehicle subsystem reconfigurations as a 211</page><page sequence="193">831543-831548 function of tactical posture, onboard faults and ongoing emergencies are all within the purview of onboard automa- tion. In order to realize these rather ambitious goals it is suggested that no one class of models is adequate in provid- ing the necessary onboard intelligence to enhance overall performance and reduce workload. Rather, a multi-model integrated approach that relies on a compendium of models from such diverse fields as artificial intelligence (AI) and expert systems, decision analysis, control theory and simula- tion is suggested as a basis for introducing onboard automa- tion. This approach relies on the selective use of one or more of these models depending on the specific tactical function and mission requirement being addressed at the time. 1983 SAE Transactions 831544. (P-132) Potential interactions of collision avoid- ance advisories and cockpit displays of traffic information. Everett Palmer and Stephen R. Ellis, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA. Future aircraft cockpits may be equipped with both colli- sion avoidance systems and cockpit traffic situation dis- plays. This paper summarizes a series of experiments in- vestigating a pilot's ability to make a variety of traffic related decisions with a traffic display. Some of the key findings were: Pilots were not able to accurately judge the future position of an aircraft unless the display contained predictor symbols. Pilots' subjective judgements of threat were inversely proportional to time to closest approach but generally were not sensitive to small changes of other pa- rameters of the encounter. When pilots were asked to make avoidance maneuvers based solely on the traffic display, they began their maneuvers well before a CAS advisory would have been triggered. Provided sufficient time was available, pilots preferred horizontal avoidance maneuvers. 831545. (P-132) Voice Interactive Electronic Warning System (VIEWS) - an applied approach to voice technology in the helicopter cockpit. James W. Voorhees, U.S. Army Aeromechanics Labora- tory, Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA; and Nancy M. Bücher, National Research Coun- cil Associate, Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA. Current helicopter cockpit design is no longer optimal for the high workload environment of Nap-of-the-Earth heli- copter missions. A high degree of information processing is required to obtain a total picture of the flight environment. Under conditions of high workload and battle stress, the extra time and effort required for this cognitive processing may be too costly. Advances in technology have allowed for qualitative changes in information display - visual symbols can be used on CRT screens and voice messages can be used for an auditory display. Both sources of information can be incorporated into an integrated warning system. The Heli- copter/VTOL Human Factors Office at Ames Research Center has begun to study the requirements for an inte- grated warning system in the helicopter cockpit. The VIEWS project investigated the use of visual symbols and speech warning messages with a radar threat warning sys- tem as a first step in developing an integrated warning system for rotorcraft. 1 983 SAE Transactions 831546. (P-132) Computers in the cockpit: but what about the pilots? Earl L. Wiener, Dept. of Management Science and Computer Information Systems, Uni- versity of Miami, Coral Gables, FL. Microprocessor development has now made it possible to automate many functions previously performed manually in the cockpit. While the automatic equipment is generally reliable and works well if operated properly, it may also be misused, if designers fail to properly consider human fac- tors in their design. Misuse or underuse may result in acci- dents, incidents, or sub-optimal system performance. This paper discusses the general problem of human factors in cockpit automation, and reports preliminary findings from a human factors study of the operational experience of air- line pilots transitioning from older DC-9 aircraft to the McDonnell-Douglas DC-9-80. 831547. Vought ground effects and transition tests of a Tandem Fan medium speed V/STOL configura- tion. T. D. Beatty and M. V. Riccius, Vought Corp., Dallas, TX. Vought has participated with the Navy and NASA in stud- ies of various subsonic and supersonic V/STOL aircraft. From these studies, a unique propulsion concept, the Tan- dem Fan, has been developed. A .11 scale subsonic V/STOL Tandem Fan model has recently been tested in Vought's large ground effects facility (LGEFF) and Vought's 7 X 10 ft low speed wind tunnel. The Vought large ground effects facility, provides V/STOL testing at hover in the presence of 0 to 30 knots winds in a free circulation environment. The Tandem Fan tests in this facility consisted of over 100 runs to evaluate both attitude and control effects. Individual fan thrust mod- ulation was tested to evaluate pitch and roll control effec- tiveness, and exhaust nozzle perturbations were tested for yaw control. The model was then installed in the Vought 7 X 10 ft. low speed wind tunnel to evaluate the cruise and upper transition flight regions. 1983 SAE Transactions 831548. A split fan concept for a medium speed V/STOL. J. D. Waller and A. R. Yackle, Lockheed- California Co., Burbank, CA. A split fan V/STOL concept when designed for short take- off and landing (STOL) can have a useful load comparable to a conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) aircraft. The STOL capability includes a deck run of no more than 400 212</page><page sequence="194">831548 - 831561 feet, while retaining an excellent vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capability. This concept also offers a simple lightweight cross-duct multiengine coupling which is adaptable to either a twin or four engine configuration. The selection of number of engines will depend on the safety of flight requirements in the VTOL mode. An inherent advan- tage of the split flow concept is the efficient propulsion con- trol system which employs cross duct coupling between en- gines. Finally, this simple compact thrust vectored split flow system has inherent features for configuring a low- observable signature aircraft. 831549. Handling characteristics of a simulated twin tilt nacelle V/STOL aircraft. S. B. Wilson, III, Heli- copter and Powered Lift Technology Division, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California; Shawn Donley, Naval Development Center, Warminster, Pennsylvania; Walter Valc- kenaere and Wolfgang Buchmann, Grumman Aerospace Corporation, Bethpage, N.Y.; and Matthew Blake, Computer Sciences Corporation, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California. The first government-conducted piloted flight simulation of the Grumman-designed twin turbofan-powered tilt-engine V/STOL aircraft (design 698) was conducted at NASA Ames Research Center. The aircraft is discussed with an emphasis on its unique hover characteristics. These charac- teristics include the adverse nonminimum phase that occurs in lateral and longitudinal translation, and the large attitude control power available. Both of these features are attrib- utes of the control vanes (a Grumman-patented concept) buried in the fan exhaust flow. The simulation used the following NASA Ames Research Center facilities: The Ver- tical Motion Simulator with the interchangeable cab, the Sigma 8 computer, and the Computer-Generated Image system with a four-window display. 1983 SAE Transactions 831550. Design of an advanced composite outer duct for the F404 engine. C. L. Stotler, General Electric Co. The use of advanced composite structures in aircraft gas turbine engines is increasing as weight and cost reductions become more difficult to achieve with conventional and even quite sophisticated metal designs. The present outer duct of the F404 engine is a chemically-milled titanium part. It is the objective of the program described in this paper to reduce the weight and cost of this component through the use of advanced composite materials. Starting in 1979, under Navy and NASA sponsorship, a graphite/PMR15 version of the F404 outer duct has been going through its design and development phases. Two complete ducts were built under this portion of the pro- gram. One duct has accumulated over 1200 hours of ground engine testing while the other duct has been successfully static tested. Based on the design, fabrication, and test ef- fort accomplished to date, a significant cost savings and a 10% weight reduction are projected for the composite duct versus the current titanium duct. 831554. Research-technology needs for transport air- planes. Robert W. Leonard, Douglas Aircraft Company, McDonnell Douglas Corporation, Long Beach, California. The transport aircraft industry is important to the United States' economy, but is strongly challenged by current and potential foreign competitors. Its primary technology needs are those aimed at propulsion efficiency improvements, weight reduction, drag reduction, and advanced flight sys- tems that will reduce direct operating costs. The most promising such technologies are briefly reviewed as to their status, potential, needed efforts, and the United States Government's recent and recommended roles. 1983 SAE Transactions 831556. Commercial transport technology advances. Ge- rald M. Bowes, Boeing Technology Research. This paper provides a perspective on commercial aircraft technology developments for the rest of the 20th century. It discusses primarily the airplane but includes observations on other parts of the transportation system. Historical achievements in commercial transport design are reviewed and form the basis for predictions of future progress in contributing aeronautical technical areas. A summary as- sessment of the positive aspects of current commercial air- craft development is given, along with a listing of issues, which must be considered in maintaining leadership in this field. 1983 SAE Transactions 831557. Research - technology needs for civil helicopters. Edward S. Carter, Sikorsky Aircraft United Technologies. There still remains a broad spectrum of challenges for ro- torcraft which run the full gamut of the aeronautical disci- plines, and which stand to benefit from the major new technology thrusts. Few vehicle types stand to gain as much from the tremendous advances being made in the fields of composite materials and microelectronics. The impact of these on the cost effectiveness and the public acceptance of rotorcraft can be tremendous. Because of the very large benefits that can accrue from quieter, safer, more efficient, more easily maintained and longer range rotorcraft, atten- tion to these problems deserves a very high priority on the national R&amp;D agenda. 1983 SAE Transactions 831561. (SP-560) Exponential factors in commercial avia- tion. John C. Brizendine. 213</page><page sequence="195">831561 - 831602 The air transport industry entered the era of commercial feasibility in 1936 with the introduction of the DC-3, which enabled airlines for the first time to operate at a profit by carrying passengers only and at existing fares. The remark- able development of air transportation into a primary worldwide mode of commerce and communication and into one of mankind's basic industries was made possible through the synergism of market growth and technological advancement. The rates of change have been exponential. This paper examines some of the critical exponential changes, how they affected the evolution of the industry, the trends leading to major issues of today, and the future ex- ponents that may be vital to a still progressive, affordable, and profitable air transport industry. 831562. Prediction of aircraft braking friction on wet run- ways - a look at past and current research activi- ties. B. C. Hainline, R. L. Arnberg, and S. K. Srinath, Boeing Commercial Airplane Company, Seattle, WA. The prediction of wet runway friction has been studied intensively over the years by several researchers. Previous attempts to predict airplane performance based on friction vehicle data have had limited success. Past research has shown that extensive, controlled testing of a specific air- plane and a suitable ground vehicle is required over a broad operational spectrum to develop prediction equations that are unique to that aircraft. The NASA Hydroplaning The- ory and the limited test data and assumptions on which that concept is based is discussed. A review is presented of the past data, the reasons for lack of correlation, the inadequa- cies of recent attempts at correlation using the hydroplan- ing theory, and the possible uses of friction vehicles to pro- vide meaningful information to the airline crews. 831600. (P-134) Traffic accidents concerning child epide- miology - mechanism and means of prevention. M. Romieu and E. Viel, SAMU Hôpital de Nimes, Nimes, France; and M. Ramet, R. Quin- cy, and L. Chirouze, ONSER - Laboratoire des Chocs et de Biomécanique, Bron, France. The aims of this paper is to define the injuries sustained by children, pedestrian or rear end car occupants, and to com- pare their lesions with those suffered by adults. We notice some differences which can be explained by differences (height and weight) but also by the dynamic of the children and by a different tolerance to impact. This paper trys to explain the differences noticed be- tween children and adults: it purposes some explicative ideas, which can be verified by specific studies. 831601. (P-134) Pedestrian impact simulation - a prelimi- nary study. Mukul K. Verma and Brian S. Repa, Engineering Mechanics Department, General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. This paper describes some results obtained from analytical three-dimensional motion simulations of child and adult pedestrians impacted by an automobile. The baseline geo- metric and stiffness parameters used in this simulation cor- respond to a typical mid-size vehicle, the latter being measured by a dynamic impactor developed for this study. The effects of variation of several of the vehicle's front-end design parameters on the impact severities of a 50th- percentile male adult and a 6-year-old child pedestrian are studied using experimental design techniques. Both the main effects and the first-order interactions among the pa- rameters are investigated, and it is shown that the counter- measure suggested for reducing adult pedestrians' injuries could aggravate child pedestrians' injuries. 831602. (P-134) An experimental study of the effects of child restraint improper installation and crash protection for larger size children. Barbara J. Kelleher and Michael J. Walsh, Calspan Ad- vanced Technology Center, Buffalo, NY; and D. Murray Dance and William T. Gardner, Trans- port Canada, Ottawa, Canada. Results of child restraint system performance during dy- namic testing of proper and improper installation configu- rations are presented and discussed. Over 75 frontal and oblique sled tests were performed using either an SA 1001 six-month old infant size, an SA103C three-year-old toddler size or a VIP-6C six-year-old size dummy. Also included are results of sled tests of restraint systems (both commer- cially available and homemade/improvised) which are in- tended to protect larger size children. Data presented in- clude head and knee excursions compared with available space in selected vehicles as well as head and chest accelera- tions and HIC values where applicable. High-speed movie coverage was used for the objective evaluation of dummy kinematics and the subjective evaluation of soft tissue load- ing and its injury-producing potential. Comparisons are made, based upon the results of the study, between proper and commonly observed improper installation performance with regard to FMVSS 213 and the proposed CMVSS 213 performance criteria. Data from the National Crash Severity System (NCSS) were examined to determine the most appropriate angle and sled test conditions for evaluating child restraint systems in oblique impacts. The results of oblique sled tests of several restraint devices using the infant, toddler and six-year-old size dummies are also presented and compared with the available space in selected vehicles. This work was partially funded by Transport Canada, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and Calspan ATC.

(P-134) Injury potential with misused child re- straining systems. K. Weber and J. W. Melvin, Transportation Res. Inst., The University of Michigan. Although child restraints are an increasingly common fixture in family cars, and even seatbelts are finding their way around children, both types of restraining systems are frequently not being used to their best advantage. Current restraint designs, misused in common ways, were studied using a variety of dummies under FMVSS-213 impact test conditions. Configurations addressed in this series include improperly installed child restraints, misused infant res- traints, multiple children in too few belts, and a misused booster. Kinematic data from high-speed films are pre- sented as well as appropriate load and acceleration data. Assessments of injury potential are made based on accepted criteria in combination with extensive laboratory testing and accident investigation experience. Results show that certain misuse configurations can have serious conse- quences for child occupants, while other variations from commonly accepted restraint practice perform reasonably well. 831605. (P-134) A global approach to child restraint systems. Thomas Turbell, National Swedish Road and Traffic Research Institute, Sweden; and Bertil Aldman, Chalmers University of Tech- nology, Sweden. The present situation as regards child restraints in Sweden is described. The concept of having small children travel- ling in rearward facing child seats in the front seat of the car is discussed, based on 15 years experience of these sys- tems in use. Booster systems which allow the older children to use existing adult belts have been bought for more than 50% of the children the last years and some aspects of this development are presented. The development of a special booster seat for handicapped children as well as the present situation on the European legislative work are also re- ported. 831606. (P-134) The influence of impact energy and direc- tion on thoracic response. Guy S. Nusholtz, John W. Melvin, and Paula Lux, University of Michi- gan, Transportation Research Institute. A test series using unembalmed cadavers was conducted to investigate thoracic response differences in lateral impacts between high energy (rib fractures produced) and low en- ergy (no rib fractures produced) testing and also the re- sponse to low energy impacts for different impact directions (frontal, 45°, and lateral). Five of the test subjects were instrumented with a nine-accelerometer package and an eighteen-accelerometer array to measure thoracic response. Seven of the test subjects were instrumented with a triaxial accelerometer on the head and a six-accelerometer array to measure thoracic response. Impact events were performed with either the UMTRI pendulum impact device or the UMTRI pneumatic impact device. The subject was struck with a free-traveling mass (25 or 56 kg) which was fitted with either a 15 cm round or 20 cm square rigid metal surface. For different impact tests this surface had affixed to it various materials which would produce different force- time and load distribution characteristics. 1983 SAE Transactions 831607. (P-134) The role of steering wheel structure in the performance of energy absorbing steering systems. John D. Horsch and Clyde C. Culver, GM Research Laboratories, Biomedical Science Dept. This study identifies important parameters that influence the basic response mechanics of a compressible column steering assembly. Energy can be absorbed either by column compression and/or steering wheel deformation, depending on relative deformation force. Neither column compressive force nor steering wheel deformation force are uniquely defined but depend on several parameters. Steering wheel deformation force is dependent on oc- cupant load distribution. The force necessary to compress the column differs from the column EA element compres- sive force due to inertial and geometric considerations. For our test conditions and the components we studied, off axis impact resulted in initial steering wheel deformation with the wheel and column sharing energy absorption. Axial impact resulted in almost negligible wheel deformation and the column was the energy absorbing component. 1983 SAE Transactions 831608. (P-134) Biomechanics of nonpenetrating aortic trauma: a review. David C. Viano, General Mo- tors Research Laboratories, Biomedical Science Dept., Warren, MI. Life threatening chest injury can involve partial or full tears of the aorta. Investigations of fatal injuries in automobile accidents indicate that aortic trauma occurs in 10-20% of the cases. The major sites of aortic trauma include the aortic isthmus, the root, and the aortic insertion at the diaphragm - all of which are points of aortic tethering. The biomechanics of the injury process involve stretching of the vessel from points of tethering and hydrodynamic increases in blood pressure, which stretch the tissue to failure at a strain of about 150%. The nonisotropic stretch response of aortic tissue is discussed with reference to the frequent transverse orientation of the laceration. Congenital and pa- thophysiological conditions also influence the failure char- acteristics of the tissue. The significant factors associated with traumatic injury of the aorta are discussed in this review paper which is based on published technical infor- mation. 831609. (P-134) Biomechanical accident investigation methodology using analytical techniques. D. H. Robbins, J. W. Melvin, D. F. Huelke, and H. W. 215</page><page sequence="197">831609-831615 Sherman, University of Michigan, Transportation Research Institute. The purpose of this paper is to describe a combination of state-of-the-art detailed accident investigation procedures, computerized vehicle crash and occupant modeling, and biomechanical analysis of human injury causation into a method for obtaining enhanced biomechanical data from car crashes. Four accident cases, out of eighteen investi- gated, were selected for detailed reconstruction. Three were frontal impacts while the fourth was lateral. The CRASH II and MVMA 2-D analytical models were used in the recon- struction process. Occupant motions, force interactions with vehicle components, accelerations on the various body segments, and much other information was produced in the simulation process and is reported in this paper along with scene and injury data from the accidents. The major con- clusion reached was that the reconstructions, using largely preliminary data for the occupant and vehicle, were evalu- ated and the dynamic loadings predicted for application to the car occupants yielded injury results which were gener- ally within accepted ranges of human tolerance data. Addi- tional conclusions were reached about the quality of data describing the occupant, car, and accident needed for ana- lytical reconstruction. 831610. (P-134) The structure of European research into the biomechanics of impacts. B. Aldman and H. Mellander, Chalmers Technical University, Gote- borg, Sweden; and M. Mackay, Accident Re- search Unit, University of Birmingham, United Kingdom. This paper reviews briefly some of the trends in biomecha- nical research in Europe. Current terminology is discussed and a set of definitions is proposed for the common descrip- tors of injury, injury severity and performance criteria based on the responses observed in the living human body, in cadavers and in other surrogates. Some of the more obvi- ous gaps in current biomechanical knowledge are discussed, particularly the need to examine the consequences of trauma at the cellular level, and some problems of experi- mental design in relation to research as the basis for legisla- tion in Europe are outlined. 831613. (P-134) Performance requirements for mechani- cal necks in lateral flexion. J. Wismans, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; and C. H. Spenny, Transportation Systems Center, Cam- bridge, MA. Realistic simulation of the neck response in a dummy is of vital importance to obtain a humanlike dynamical behavior of the head. Trajectories of the head and the nature of head contact with vehicle interior or exterior are critically depen- dent on the dummy's neck design. Neck performance criteria in literature are limited to the neck response in forward flexion and extension. Recent research programs to develop dummies with omnidirec- tional biofidelity clearly show a need for additional require- ments in lateral and oblique directions. In this study, dy- namic lateral flexion tests with human volunteers conducted by the Naval Biodynamics Laboratory (NBDL) in New Orleans are analysed. It follows that the observed head neck motions in this type of impact quite well can be represented by a system with three degrees of freedom: a head and neck rotation in the plane of impact and a head torsion about the head anatomical z-axis. Mechanical and geometrical properties of this system resulting from tests with 6 different subjects under various test conditions are presented. Based on this analysis, a simple test set-up is proposed, derived from the most severe NBDL test conditions, for the evaluation of existing or future mechanical head-neck de- signs. Requirements for the head motion in this specific test set-up are presented. 1983 SAE Transactions 831614. (P-134) Experimental spinal trauma studies in the human and monkey cadaver. J. Myklebust, A. Sanees, Jr., D. Maiman, F. Pintar, M. Chilbert, W. Rauschning, S. Larson, and J. Cusick, Dept. of Neurosurgery, The Medical College of Wiscon- sin and Wood Veterans Administration Medical Center, Milwaukee, WI; C. Ewing and D. Tho- mas, Naval Biodynamics Laboratory, New Or- leans, LA; and B. Saltzberg, Texas Research In- stitute of Mental Sciences, Houston, TX. Compression studies were conducted on the ligamentous thoracolumbar spines of fresh human male cadavers. For comparison, forces were applied to the posterior upper tho- racic region of intact seated cadavers. Since thoracolumbar flexion injury routinely involves ligament failure and verte- bral body wedge compression fractures, studies were con- ducted on single vertebral bodies and isolated ligaments. Similar studies were conducted in isolated monkey liga- ments. The intact and ligamentous thoracolumbar spines failed predominantly in the region of the thoracolumbar junction at forces from 1113-5110 N. For both the human and monkey cadavers, the anterior longitudinal ligament was the strongest. The human ligaments were 2-5 times stronger than those of the monkey. 831615.

Maret Maxwell, National Institutes of Health, Biomedical Engi- neering and Instrumentation Branch. Time-varying compressive loading was applied to un- embalmed human cervical spines using an MTS closed-loop hydraulic testing machine. Load programs included relaxa- tion, cyclic loading, variable rate constant velocity loading (0.13-64 cm/sec), and constant velocity loading to failure. The failures produced were similar to those observed clini- 216</page><page sequence="198">831615-831619 cally. A generalized quasi-linear viscoelastic Maxwell- Weichert model incorporating a continuous relaxation spec- trum was developed to predict the relaxation and constant velocity test responses. The fit was adequate considering the complexity of the structure involved. 1983 SAE Transactions 831616. (P-134) Cervical spine injury mechanisms. G. S. Nusholtz and D. E. Huelke, The University of Michigan; P. Lux and N. M. Alem, University of Michigan, Transportation Research Institute; and F. Montalvo, General Motors Corp. A test series using eight unembalmed cadavers was con- ducted to investigate factors affecting the creation of cervi- cal spine damage from impact to the crown of the head. The crown impact was accomplished by a free-fall drop of the test subject onto a load plate. The load plate striking surface was covered with padding to vary the contact force time characteristics. The orientations of the head, cervical spine, and torso were adjusted relative to a laboratory coordinate system to investigate the effects of head and spinal configu- ration on the damage patterns. Load and acceleration data are presented as a function of time and as a function of frequency in the form of mechanical impedance. 831617. (P-134) Seated posture of vehicle occupants. D. H. Robbins, L. W. Schneider, R. G. Snyder, and M. Pflug, University of Michigan, Transportation Research Institute; and Mark Haffner, U.S. Dept. of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This paper describes the methodology and results from a project involving development of anthropometrically based design specifications for a family of advanced adult anthro- pomorphic dummies. Selection of family members and an- thropometric criteria for subject sample selection were based on expected applications of the devices and on an analysis of U.S. population survey data. This resulted in collection of data for dummy sizes including a small female, a mid-sized male, and a large male. The three phases of data collection included: 1. in- vehicle measurements to determine seat track position and seating posture preferred by the subjects for use in develop- ment of laboratory seat bucks; 2. measurement of sub- ject/seat interface contours for fabrication of an average hard seat surface for use in the buck; and 3. measurement of standard anthropometry, seated anthropometry (in the buck), and three-dimensional surface landmark coordinates using standard and photogrammetric techniques. Following data collection, activity was concentrated on data analysis and development of specifications. Data for each subject group were averaged for use in development of two reference resources. One is an epoxy/fiberglass stan- dard reference shell positioned in the average hard seat. The other is an anthropometric specification package consisting of full-size drawings detailing estimates of body linkage, mass, and segmentation data. Final results are presented for the mid-sized male population group. 1983 SAE Transactions 831618. (P-134) The role of impact location in reversible cerebral concussion. Voigt R. Hodgson and L. Murray Thomas, Wayne State Univ. School of Medicine, Dept. of Neurosurgery; and Tawfik B. Khalil, General Motors Research Laboratories, Biomedical Science Dept. Mechanical impacts were delivered by an air propelled striker to the front, side, rear and top of rigid protective caps worn by six anesthetized monkeys. These tests were to produce reversible concussion and to determine differences in tolerance to concussion among the four impact sites. Striker force and cap accelerations were measures of the impact severity and animal blood pressure, respiration and ECG changes were measures of the physiological effects. By distributing the blow with a protective cap, allow- ing free head movement after impact, skull fracture was eliminated and simple reversible concussion could be pro- duced without symptoms of residual neurological deficit. Higher linear and angular accelerations produced longer periods of unconsciousness (more than 3 times) on the side than at any of the other locations. It is hypothesized that the decrease in concussion tolerance accompanied by higher accelerations for side impacts may be the result of lower mechanical impedance due to the oval shape of the animal head. 1983 SAE Transactions 831619. (P-134) Morphological and biomechanical study of 146 human skulls used in experimental im- pacts, in relation with the observed injuries. C. Got, F. Guillon, A. Patel, and P. Mack, I.R.B.A., Hôpital R. Poincaré, Garches; F. Brun-Cassan, A. Fayon, and C. Tarrière, Laboratory of Physi- ology and Biomechanics, Peugeot SA/Renault Rueil; and J. Hureau, Anatomical Laboratory, Saints Pères UER - Paris. Biomechanical studies related to the head have been mainly directed towards the determination of cerebral tolerance to impact in the absence of fracture. However, the frequency of skull trauma producing complex fractures and cerebral lesions linked to these fractures should be taken into consid- eration. On a human being, impacts under similar mechani- cal conditions can produce either fatal encephalic lesions without fractures or skull fractures with encephalic lesions if the subject has a different skull morphology. A sample of 146 subjects has been studied to determine the relation between the morphological characteristics of the skulls (weight of the skull cap, thickness, weight of the cranial skeleton...), their mineralization. The mechanical tests were performed on bone fragments (bending and shearing tests). Nine accelerometers were used during the experiments of various types of impacts. The results were computerized. 217</page><page sequence="199">831619-831624 The skull fractures observed (a total of 45) are described. An analysis of the results has been made and enables us to make a correlation between the characteristics of the skull and those of the impacts with the type of fractures. 1 983 SAE Transactions 831620. (P-134) Head impacts with roof-pillar support structures - problem identification. William R. S. Fan, National Highway Traffic Safety Adminis- tration. The objective of this study is to assess the safety problem concerning head impacts with roof-pillar support structures and to identify potential remedies for the problem. Also, the study presents an illustration of using accident data, in conjunction with the existing laboratory test data and mathematical simulations, as a tool for the evaluation of motor vehicle safety problems. The study starts with a general discussion on the oc- cupant harm distribution as a function of injury sources and injured body regions, then progresses to head impact prob- lems. The subject head impact problem can be character- ized as a typical hard impact problem. Also, hard copy accident reports were analyzed to better understand the real world head injury mechanisms that when combined with biomechanics data, were used to identify practical ap- proaches for head injury mitigation. The study was based on the NCSS and the NASS accident data, laboratory impact test data, and occupant crash simulations. The results indicate that the subject safety problem will be a major concern to the safety com- munity in the near future. 831622. (P-134) The trajectories of pedestrians, motor- cycles, motorcyclists, etc., following a road acci- dent. John A. Searle, Motor Industry Research Association; and Angela Searle. For many years accident investigators have been faced by the problem of estimating the projection velocity associated with a given trajectory. The most recent contributions to this topic were two papers at the 1981 A A AM but these, like earlier work, deal only with the aerial part of the trajec- tory, until the object first lands. In most accidents however the point of first landing cannot be determined and it is the point at which the object comes to rest which is recorded. The present paper derives an equation for the projec- tion velocity associated with a given total trajectory. Using this equation it is possible to bracket the limits within which the projection velocity must lie, even when the angle of projection is unknown. In order to facilitate the use of this approach, data have been obtained on the frictional coefficients. This information is compared with existing field data on pedestrian trajectories. It is found that these pedestrian trajectories correspond to only a percentage of the full ve- locity of the vehicle. This percentage is large for children struck by vehicles with high front ends, approaching 100%, but is significantly less for adults and for vehicles with low fronts. 831623. (P-134) Experimental study of a compliant bumper system. Olle Bunketorp, Bertil Romānus, and Tommy Hansson, Dept. of Orthopaedic Sur- gery, University of Göteborg; Bertil Aldman and Lennart Thorngren, Dept. of Traffic Safety, Chalmers University of Technology, Göteborg; and Rolf H. Eppinger, NHTSA, U.S. Dept. of Transportation, Washington, DC. An ordinary rigid bumper system and a compliant bumper system for pedestrian protection developed by the NHTSA, US Department of Transportation, were compared in an experimental study of leg injuries in car-pedestrian acci- dents. Human leg specimens were struck in 20 experiments with a production car front using the two bumper types. Impacts were made with an ordinary front configuration with the bumpers at the 45 cm level and a 12.5 cm lower front configuration with the bumpers at the 32.5 cm level. The impact velocity was 30-32 km/h. Serious leg injuries were noted with both front config- urations and bumper types. The compliant bumper seemed to cause less serious injuries than the rigid one, and the lower front configura- tion seemed to cause less serious injuries than the ordinary one. A lower bumper level than today's standard and a compliant bumper type is recommended in combination to reduce the risk of serious leg injuries in car-pedestrian acci- dents. 831624. (P-134) Durability, repeatability and reproduci- bility of the NHTSA side impact dummy. Bruce R. Donnelly, Arvin/Calspan Advanced Technol- ogy Center, Buffalo, NY; and Richard M. Mor- gan and Rolf H. Eppinger, U.S. Dept. of Trans- portation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Washington, DC. A series of seventy-two pendulum-type impact tests were performed on six NHTSA Side Impact Dummies (SID) to assess dummy repeatability and reproducibility. A quantity called the Normalized Integral Square Error (NISE) is used to quantify the difference between acceleration responses from repeat tests. Limits for the NISE are developed to define acceptable differences in terms of phase shift, ampli- tude, and shape. Results indicate that the SID is repeatable in all of the test cases considered and fairly reproducible in 90° lateral impacts although this is not shown conclusively. Before the testing could be performed it was necessary to correct several durability problems with the SID that were identified while early production versions of the dummy were being tested. These modifications are de- scribed briefly. 218</page><page sequence="200">831625-831629 831625. (P-134) Speed limit reduction from 60 to 50 km/h and pedestrian injuries. Felix H. Walz, Matilda Hoefliger, and Wolfgang Fehlmann, Institute of Forensic Medicine, University of Zurich. Impact speed is the major parameter for the causation of pedestrian injuries. After the introduction of a 50 km/h speed limit, reduced from 60 km/h in the city of Zurich, the incidence of car-pedestrian accidents was cut by 16%, the number of injured pedestrians by 20% (p =&lt; .01), and the fatalities by 25%. These are results of an investigation of a complete sample of 946 car-pedestrian accidents in Zurich during two years, one before and one after the introduction of the lower speed limit. The most pronounced reduction was seen with victims rated MAIS 5 (decline of 86%). A detailed analysis of the ISS categories is given in terms of mortality and survival time. Fractures of the ribs and the pelvis were reduced by 50%. Special attention is given to impact speed. Due to a 36% lower overall hospital related treatment period the medical expenses were cut considera- bly. The analysis revealed that virtually the whole reduction should be attributed to the lower speed limit and not to other parameters such as the number of inhabitants or cars registered, cost of gas, etc. 831627. (P-134) Pedestrian hip impact simulator develop- ment and hood edge location consideration on injury severity. H. B. Pritz, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; and J. M. Pereira, The Ohio State University. This paper describes an upper leg impact simulator that is representative of the dynamics of impacts between the pe- destrian hip or upper leg and the vehicle hood edge. Cadaver tests have been analyzed to obtain the actual velocity of the upper leg as it strikes the hood edge. It is found that the impact velocity of the hip or upper leg onto the hood edge is approximately one third of the vehicle velocity for a conventional vehicle front. The MADYMO computer program is used to study the effects of different hood edge locations, relative to the bumper, on the total body dynamics of the pedestrian. It is found that changes in the location of the hood edge cause significant changes in the head and torso impact with the hood of the vehicle. Several techniques are discussed for examining the benefits of different hood edge locations on total body in- jury. One of these, an influence factor, combines injury information from actual accident data for the various parts of the body with the impact forces from the mathematical simulations. Based on this factor, there appears to be a hood edge location that may mitigate injuries to both chil- dren and adults. 831628. (P-134) A detailed injury severity scale for lower limbs based on analysis of injuries sustained by pedestrians. J. Farisse, J. Bonnoit, B. Seriat- Gautier, C. Brunet, N. Daon, and O.

Billault, Auto- mobiles CITROEN; and P. Bourret, ONSER and Hôpital de Salon de Provence, France. This paper is based on the results of 50 pedestrian cadaver tests in which the lower limbs injuries were carefully ana- lyzed. The leg injury distribution, the consequences of these injuries will be evaluated through the analysis of equivalent injuries sustained by pedestrian in traffic accidents. These injuries are of several types and involve all bio- logical tissues of lower limbs. We propose a classification of these injuries according to their kind, their location, their number and their association. This classification allows us to point out that present scales are not enough detailed and are not suitable for the reality of these injuries. On this basis we propose intermediate stages in order to refine the pre- sent AIS and MAIS scales. 831629. (P-134) Study of "knee-thigh-hip" protection cri- terion. Y. C. Leung, B. Hue, A. Fayon, C. Tanière, and H. Hamon, Laboratory of Physiol- ogy and Biomechanics, Peugeot-Renault Associa- tion (France); C. Got and A. Patel, I.R.B.A. Raymond Poincaré Hospital, Garches, France; and J. Hureau, Faculty of Medicine, University of Paris, France. A series of fresh human cadaver and Part 572 dummy tests was performed under different conditions which were com- parable to those of real-world accidents. A European car model mounted on a sled was used; a pair of knee-targets was fixed directly to the car body in front of the passenger knees. Test conditions are summarized as follows: human- 3-pt-belted cadaver with a sled impact velocity of 50 or 65 kph; 2-pt (thoracic)-belted-cadaver with a velocity of 65 kph, the legs being positioned normally or in an oblique manner. Since the knee-thigh-hip tolerance is related to the shape and duration of the impact pulse, these interactions were the subject of study. The tolerance to fractures depends to a great extent on the subject's bone condition. In order to predict the risk of fracture for the whole population from the tolerance found in the tested subjects, studies of mineralization and bone strength were carried out on the compact-bone-sections taken from the femurs of the tested cadavers. Tests were conducted also, using a Part 572 dummy, which enabled to predict a criterion for the knee-thigh-hip protection matched to this surrogate. Discussion of similar attempts, such as F.I.C. (Femur Injury Criterion) and K.T.H.I.C. is included. 1983 SAE Transactions 219</page><page sequence="201">831630-831634 831630. (P-134) Side impact - a comparison between HSRI, APROD and HYBRID II dummies and cadavers. G. Klaus, Volkswagenwerk AG, Wolfsburg; and D. Kallieris, Institute for Foren- sic Medicine, University of Heidelberg. The paper presents and describes results of the FAT research-project Phase I "Kinematics and Loadings during Side Impacts: Comparison between Dummies and Cadav- ers". It will report on 30 side impacts at 50 km/h under 90° impact angle conducted with three different dummies and cadavers. On the basis of the test results dummy modifica- tions will be proposed. The side impacts caused following main injuries in the cadavers: rib fractures on the impacted side were most frequently observed (AIS thorax 2-4). The most serious injuries were liver ruptures predominantly on right-side impacted cadavers (AIS up to 5). Cervical spine injuries with an AIS value of 1 and 2 were also noted. Fracture of the pelvis occurred only in one, bony head injuries in two cases. 1983 SAE Transactions 831631. (P-134) Lateral protection of passenger cars - comparison tests by means of different barrier configurations. Wolfgang Sievert and Ernst Pull- witt, Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt) Traffic Safety and Accident Research Dept., Co- logne. The results obtained from a series of tests are described, comparing the effects (deformations and dummy load va- lues) caused by lateral collisions at right angles on a sub- compact car (VW Golf/Rabbit), impacted by a car of the same type, by an intermediate car (Daimler Benz W 123) and also by barriers with a rigid front (SAE) and a deform- able front (CCMC). The sub-compact car of the same type was also used in dived braking position and impacts of the sub-compact car against the intermediate one were also undertaken. In the case of the deformable barrier, the mass of the barrier and the collision speed were additionally var- ied. The main results are: • with respect to car/car collisions, the general intru- sion characteristics and the special and important interac- tion of dummy/door intrusion can be better simulated with a deformable barrier than with a rigid barrier • the influence of the barrier's mass is less, whilst the influence of the test speed is highly significant (related to intrusion characteristics) • the rigid barrier causes too high chest loadings re- lated to car/car collisions • the front deformation of the striking cars is, related to compatibility aspects, too low • the door sill experiences too small a load transfer even in the dived braking position • the load transfer to the A- and C-pillars is very low when an intermediate car is struck by a subcompact car; in spite of the favourable mass ratio in this case, there are relatively deep door intrusions. 1983 SAE Transactions 831632. (P-134) Evaluation of side impact protection in barrier to car tests. Dominique Cesari and René Zac, ONSER-Laboratoire des chocs et de biome- canique, Bron, France; and Arnold Johnson, Na- tional Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Eight barrier to car side impact tests were conducted with dummies and with cadavers. The barrier and the test configuration were those pro- posed by NHTSA for side impact car testing. Two types of car were used: an unmodified (baseline) Rabbit, and a mod- ified (for side impact protection) Rabbit. The modifications concern the reinforcement of the side structures and the use of an internal padding for protection of pelvis and thorax. The results of these tests show a good repeatability of car deformation, a decrease of injury related parameters with the modified Rabbit, and a change in the velocity of car elements and body regions. 831633. (P-134) Interaction of car passengers in side col- lisions - tests with four new side impact dum- mies. Eberhard Faerber, Federal Highway Re- search Institute (BASt) Traffic Safety and Accident Research Dept., Cologne. The aim of this study is to evaluate the interaction of car passengers in side collisions. In 12 side impact tests, four newly developed side impact dummies (APROD 82, HSRI, MIRA, ONSER) were positioned at the impact side of the car, with the interacting dummy - a Hybrid II dummy - on the offside. The velocity of the impacting rigid barrier was 45 km/h. Each test configuration with each side impact dummy was repeated three times. They are compared with tests of the same configuration but without an interacting Hybrid II dummy. The kinematics of the side impact dummies are more humanlike in side impacts than those of the Hybrid II dummy which was used in a previous test program on the impact side. Each side impact dummy showed interaction effects and loads in different measuring parameters. 831634. (P-134) Human response to and injury from lat- eral impact. Jeffrey H. Marcus, Richard M. Mor- gan, and Rolf H. Eppinger, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Washington, DC; and Dimitrios Kallieris, Rainer Mattern, and Georg Schmidt, University of Heidelberg. Lateral impacts have been shown to produce a large portion of both serious and fatal injuries within the total automotive crash problem. These injuries are produced as a result of the rapid changes in velocity that an automobile occupant's body experiences during a crash. In an effort to understand the mechanisms of these injuries, an experimental program using human surrogates (cadavers) was initiated. Initial im- 220</page><page sequence="202">831634-831653 pact velocity and compliance of the lateral impacting sur- face were the primary test features that were controlled, while age of the test specimen was varied to assess its influ- ence on the injury outcome. Instrumentation consisted of 24 accelerometer channels on the subjects along with contact forces measured on the wall both at the thoracic and pelvic level. The individual responses and resulting injuries sus- tained by 1 1 new subjects tested at the University of Heidel- berg are presented in detail. An examination of the relation- ship between forces applied and responses observed in the thorax is discussed. The average injuries for different sled test conditions are presented based on a total of 42 cadaver tests (11 of which are the ones discussed above). The comparison of rigid wall and padded wall sled tests is made based on these average injuries. 831635. (P-134) Belt slip measurements on human volun- teers and the Part 572 dummy in low-Gx impact acceleration. Paul C. Begeman, Robert S. Levine, and Albert I. King, Wayne State University, De- troit, MI. A series of volunteer and dummy impact experiments was performed on a Hyge-type (accelerator) sled to study the relative motion between the upper torso restraint and the torso surface. Kinematic measurements were made using a three-dimensional photogrammetric analysis of high-speed film data. Belt slip was found to be in the range of approxi- mately 10 to 30 mm with more slip experienced by volun- teers than the dummy. The dummy showed a slight change in amount of slip with acceleration level and all slip takes place within the first 80 ms of belt loading. 1983 SAE Transactions 831636. (P-134) Comparison of current anthropomorphic test devices in a three-point belt restraint system. Roger A. Saul and Lisa K. Sullivan, Vehicle Re- search and Test Center, East Liberty, OH; and Jeffrey H. Marcus and Richard M. Morgan, Na- tional Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Washington, DC. Frontal sled tests of the Part 572, APR, and Hybrid III dummies were conducted in a three-point restraint system at 50 km/hr velocity change. The tests were conducted to evaluate the dummy responses in a tightly controlled sys- tems environment, and to compare the dummy responses to previously established cadaver responses from the same en- vironment. The Hybrid III dummy measurement repeata- bility was found to be better than either the Part 572 or APR dummies, although the thoracic acceleration re- sponses from all three are shown to be quite similar to cadavers. Correlation of the dummy measurements are made to a limited amount of both the cadaver data and accident data from the National Crash Severity Study. 1983 SAE Transactions 831650. (P-135) The state of the art of child passenger safety legislation in North America. Elaine Wein- stein Lawless, National Child Passenger Safety Association; and Theresa A. Siani, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Child safety seats provide an effective means for protecting children in car crashes. Without legislation, few States have been able to obtain usage rates greater than the 20-30 per- cent range. As a result, 40 States, the District of Columbia, and five Canadian Provinces have now passed child passen- ger safety laws. These laws vary considerably from State to State. The most important provisions and variations among these laws are summarized in this paper. Since only 19 State laws have been in existence for six months or more, une- quivocal data concerning their effectiveness is not yet available. However, initial data gathered on both a national (19 city) level and in various States suggests that these laws are effective in terms of raising usage rates and lowering deaths and injuries to young children. Much needs to be done, however, to realize the full potential of such legisla- tion. Specifically, education, loan-a-seat programs, and most importantly, enforcement must be improved and pro- moted. 1983 SAE Transactions 831651. (P-135) Child restraints legislation in Europe. J. C. Bastiaanse, Research Institute for Road Ve- hicles TNO, Delft, The Netherlands; and J. Mal- tha, Research Institute for Road Vehicles, TNO, Delft, The Netherlands. A short review is presented on crash protection standards for children in the European countries. In Europe the only international standard is the new ECE 44 regulation on child restraints, which is currently replacing most of the existing national standards. The specific requirements of this regulation cover aspects such as: configuration of the systems, allowed types of buckles, straps, retractors, ad- justment devices, corrosion and crash performance. An evaluation of the crash performance of a wide variety of current restraint systems is presented, based on two years of experience with the regulation. This shows the restrictive nature of the regulation and the need for substantial rede- sign of most of the current products. Finally additional suggestions are presented to increase the acceptance of the systems by the children as well as the parents. 831653. (P-135) Development of a seat belt booster cush- ion standard. P. E. Waters, Department of Transport, England. With a desire to devise some means of child restraint that would find wider acceptance and use than the traditional child restraint, it was decided to develop a standard for seat belt booster cushions. These are a firm seat for a child designed to improve the fit of an adult seat belt and which can readily be removed and used in any car in which the child might be required to travel. 221</page><page sequence="203">831653 - 831660 There were difficulties with the interpretation of ECE Regulation No 44 and so it was decided to develop a sepa- rate British Standard as a second option. The Standard that was developed recognises that the use of an adult belt to restrain a child is not ideal and gives a lower level of protection than a purpose built child re- straint. Therefore, the opportunity was taken to use simpli- fied test procedures to avoid many of the problems inherent in Regulation No 44. 831654. (P-135) Protection for 5-12 year old children. John B. Morris, Office of Vehicle Research, Na- tional Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Children in the 5-12 year old age bracket represent today about 13 percent of the U.S. population, about 22 percent of the other-than-driver car occupants (passengers), about 9 percent of the accident involved car passengers, and about 5 percent of the seriously or fatally injured car passengers. The usage rate of occupant restraints by this age bracket is only a few percent, almost entirely safety belts of the com- mon type, and is substantially lower than that for all age brackets. This paper addresses the question of what type of occupant restraints may be appropriate for this age bracket in view of general concerns about the fit of safety belts. The paper analyzes the accident experience of 5-12 year old children as car passengers in comparison with that of pas- sengers in all age brackets. The accident records analyzed are those of the Fatal Accident Reporting System, and State data from the files of Washington, North Carolina, Mary- land, and Michigan. Based on the analyses of the accident data guidelines are recommended for the 5-12 year old child. 831655. (P-135) Development of infant and child restraint regulations and their application. Vladislav G. Radovich, Office of Vehicle Safety Standards, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. An overview of the evolution of child restraints and related safety standards in the U.S.A. is given, including the publi- cation of the FMVSS No. 213-Child Restraint Systems, which became effective on January 1, 1981. The effect the standard has on the design and use of child restraints is discussed. Some current and planned work pertaining to installation of child restraint and evaluation of restraints for use by older children is also described. The main provisions of four standards, i.e. Australian, Canadian, U.N. Eco- nomic Commission for Europe and U.S. are reviewed and comparison of their major provisions is made. 831656. (P-135) Evaluation of the effectiveness of child safety seats in actual use. Charles Jesse Kahane and Jerome Kossar, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; and George Y. H. Chi, Food and Drug Administration. A comprehensive review of casualty-reducing effectiveness estimates of child safety seats in actual use, obtained by statistical analyses of highway accident data. Recent anal- yses of large samples of New York and Maryland accidents show statistically significant injury reductions for child safety seats; so does a new analysis of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's accident files. Results from Washington State, Tennessee, New Jersey, and Idaho are also reviewed, as are Nationwide restraint usage and fatality trends. The findings are critically examined for possible data biases. It is concluded that child safety seats definitely reduce deaths and injuries in highway crashes, but that their effectiveness cannot be accurately estimated at this time because of inconsistencies and possible biases in the various studies. 1983 SAE Transactions 831659. (P-135) Multidisciplinary staffing for etiologie analysis of childhood pedestrian injury - pilot study of methodology. K. K. Christoffel, Dept. of Pediatrics, Children's Memorial Hospital, Chi- cago, II; J. L. Schofer and P. P. Jovanis, North- western University Transportation Center, Ev- anston, IL; B. Brandt, Dept. of Psychiatry, Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL; B. White and R. Tanz, Dept. of Social Work, Chil- dren's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL; and J. McKnight and R. Hoganson, Center for Urban Affairs, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL. A multidisciplinary team was constituted for analysis of child pedestrian injuries. In a pilot study of the utility of such analysis, it was found that (1) the multidisciplinary approach identified possible etiologie factors missed with- out it, (2) this approach requires the availability of high quality medical information and police accident records, (3) biological, psychological, and social characteristics of vic- tims, victim families and communities appear to affect the occurrence of child pedestrian injuries; and, (4) such victim factors must be considered in development of countermea- sures. It is concluded that the technique of multidisciplinary staffing merits further application as a productive way to generate quantitatively testable hypotheses concerning childhood pedestrian injury causality and potential counter- measures. 831660. (P-135) Compliance testing to the new dynamic standard for child restraint systems. James C. Gilkey, Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. A new dynamic performance standard for child restraint systems (FMVSS No. 213) became effective on January 1, 1981. The Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance (OVSC) in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) developed a test procedure and conducted com- pliance tests to determine whether the systems available in 222</page><page sequence="204">831660-831664 the marketplace met the requirements of the standard. The restraints tested were in compliance with the dynamic sys- tems test requirement of the standard, however, some of the systems failed to meet certain component test requirements. Technical investigations were initiated to examine more fully the extent of the apparent noncompliances to the stan- dard. 831661. (P-135) Crash victim simulation - a first step in child auto safety. R. L. Stalnaker, Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Ohio State Univer- sity, Columbus, OH. The use of Crash Victim Simulation (CVS) computer pro- grams has become more and more important in highway safety research. These programs in the past were primarily used to study the interactions of a dummy with the vehicle seat and belt system. Now because of the computer technol- ogy boom more powerful computer systems and their sup- porting software are available to more researchers at a rea- sonable cost. This has stimulated CVS program usage in other areas of highway safety research, such as pedestrian impacts, dummy design, vehicle interior design, and child restraint system design and evaluation. This paper discusses the role of CVS computer pro- grams in child automotive safety. Examples of how the MADYMO CVS program has been used to determine feasi- bility, design, optimization, patent right definition, and im- proved performance of child restraint systems are pre- sented. 831662. (P-135) An analytical model of children in a pa- nic braking environment with experimental vali- dation. P. H. Cheng and D. A. Guenther, De- partment of Mechanical Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH. This paper describes a linear acceleration sled device devel- oped to study child responses to panic braking environ- ments. A sled with a vehicle seat and soft simulated dash is accelerated by a drop weight in a similar fashion to actual vehicle decelerations when panic braking. A simple, two degree of freedom analytical model of the experimental device was developed to predict the dy- namic performance of the sled and examine the sensitivity of various parameters in producing acceleration time histo- ries of actual braking vehicles. This includes the study of drop weight size, drop weight distance, cable size, initial cable pretensioning and sled braking levels. A simple, two degree of freedom analytical model was also examined to simulate a child dummy sitting on the sled seat and verified by using actual sled acceleration-time pulses. The model was based on previously conducted vehicle braking tests with dummies and child dummy tests conducted on the linear acceleration sled device. Some of the parameters ex- amined for dummy motion sensitivity were sled accelera- tion levels, sled acceleration duration, initial child position, seat surface friction, seat angle and child model joint stiff- ness. 831663. (P-135) Growth of the pelvis in children. Wm. Cameron Chumlea, Department of Pediatrics, Wright State University School of Medicine, Dayton, OH. Growth and maturation of the pelvis are complex but the process of endochondral ossification in the pelvis is the same as that in the long bones. Primary ossification of the pelvis is completed about 8 years of age, and secondary ossification is completed in the early twenties. Growth of the pelvis follows that of the rest of the body. The most rapid period of growth is in the first year of life. A stable rate of growth is attained after age 3 years until puberty. Basic sex differences in the adult pelvis are established in early childhood. Exterior dimensions of the pelvis are grea- ter in boys, but interior dimensions of the pelvis are greater in girls. Much of the present knowledge about growth and maturation of the pelvis has come from radiographs. More current knowledge of pelvic growth is needed by those in- volved in automobile restraint design. Pelvic injuries are not uncommon to children in automobile accidents. A child's body is not similar to an adult's, so the results of pelvic injuries may produce life long problems. 1983 SAE Transactions 831664. (P-135) From three-years-old to adult size - how to ensure child protection in automobile acci- dents. C. Tarrière, C. Thomas, and F. Brun- Cassan, Laboratoire de Physiologie et de Biomécanique, Peugeot S.A./Renault; and C. Got, and A. Patel, Institut de Recherches Biomécaniques et Accidentologiques. Safety of children as car occupants raises a specific prob- lem: it is necessary to take into account two factors which are particular to them: their very fast growth and their behavior, which corresponds to a need for movement. An analysis of statistical and accidentological data points to the fact that whereas traffic accidents account for 25% of adult deaths, they account for nearly 50% of deaths for children (all kinds of road-users). Measures were adopted in France; such as the obliga- tion for children of less than 10-years-old to travel on rear seats of cars and the definition of an homologation proce- dure for children restraint devices, with the aim of limiting the consequences of these accidents. The most common restraint devices look like little in- dividual seats and are designed to protect young children (less than 3-years-old). Recently, new restraint devices, cal- led "cushions", were developed. They are designed for chil- dren of over 3 and they can be used almost up to small adult sizes. They enable some improvements in the location of the adult belt on the child's body; thus, improving safety. 223</page><page sequence="205">831664-831675 Several cushions were submitted to simulated frontal collisions, by using them in a car body fixed to a sled; the impact severity was similar to that encountered in some European restraint system certification tests. These runs brought to light the dynamic response obtained with these cushions and their efficiency, as regards the restraint of child dummies. From these results and with the help of an anthropo- metric survey concerning the heights of children between 3 and 10 years old, cushion shapes were defined, to be used simultaneously with a 3-pt-belt. This cushion was tested with the 3-year and 6-year child dummies and proved to be very efficient as regards safety; it also appears suitable from the standpoint of comfort. 1983 SAE Transactions 831665. (P-135) Observed misuse of child restraints. An- nemarie Shelness, Physicians for Automotive Safety; and Jean Jewett, Jewett Safety Corp. The high level of crashworthiness of child restraining devices (CRDs) mandated by FMVSS No. 213-80, and the dynamic test procedure adopted voluntarily by the industry before 213-80 went into effect, do not necessarily transfer from the laboratory to the family automobile. Correct use of CRDs is essential; misuse reduces or could even defeat the protective potential. To establish the magnitude of one part of the misuse problem, 23 observers in 12 states examined installation of CRDs in the forward-facing "toddler" mode for errors in seat belt routing and top tether installation. Of the 3233 crashworthy CRDs observed, 51% required a tether strap. Correct use of tethers was noted in only 16% of these. Of the 2323 CRDs examined for seat belt as well as tether installation, 75% were found to have errors in belt routing, tether use, or both. The consequences of misuse are touched upon, possible reasons for misuse are discussed, and reme- dies are suggested. 1983 SAE Transactions 831666. (P-135) Learning from child protection devices and concepts from outside of the United States. Carl C. Clark, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. We are seeking to test and adapt successful devices for child crash protection from outside the United States not now used here. Test results and possible problems are presented for a transverse infant bed, a toddler backward facing seat, and an older child booster seat with back and head supports (from Kilppan, Sweden), and the Australian "Sit-Safe" de- sign, an inexpensive belt to go between the shoulder strap and the lap belt to insure that the shoulder belt does not touch the child's neck. We have also tested an inflated pad alternative to the upper back of the front seat bulge passive restraint of DeRampe (France) to reduce knee contact - leg straightening - body vaulting which contributes to ejection of unrestrained people from the back seat. And we are testing plastic coated side glass to explore extending the anti-lacerative glazing advance of Saint-Gobain Vitrage (France) to the even more significant potential reduction of ejection. 831667. (P-135) Road accident epidemiology among chil- dren - investigation at Marseille's Hospital. Maryvonne DeJeammes and Roger Biard, ONSER - Laboratoire des Chocs, France; and Bernard Seriat-Gautier, Hôpital Nord de Mar- seille, France. In France, among the 12200 road users who died in 1979, 900 were children under 15 years. General statistics indi- cate that road accident fatalities are quite comparable for children between the three users' categories - pedestrians, cyclists and automobile occupants. In order to propose some technical improvements for primary as well as secondary safety, it is important to better specify the real distribution of risks, the circumstances and injury consequences of accidents. An epidemiological investigation has been set up with its sources at the hospital emergency services specialised for children. The first results obtained at the hospital Marseille Nord are discussed and let emphasized on the higher sever- ity of head injuries, particularly with unconsciousness for the pedestrian. Lower limbs lesions were mainly fractures for the pedestrian while the 2 wheeler suffered fractures to both upper and lower limbs. The child car occupant, sitting in the rear seat, was injured by impact against the front seats and the car structure. The thoracoabdominal viscera were very seldom injured. 1983 SAE Transactions 831675. Conversion of fuel nitrogen to NO in automotive engines. Alex R. Sapre and Ather A. Quader, Fuels and Lubricants Department, General Mo- tors Research Laboratories. Nitrogen-free and nitrogen-doped fuels were investigated using a single-cylinder, spark-ignition engine, and gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles. The single-cylinder engine experiments showed that only NO (nitric oxide) emissions were affected by nitrogen in the fuel and that the percentage of fuel nitrogen converted to NO (PNCNO) ranged from about 5 to 100. Generally, PNCNO increased when equiva- lence ratio, concentration of nitrogen in the fuel, engine load, or compression ratio decreased; PNCNO also in- creased as the level of EGR or engine speed increased, or as spark timing was retarded from MBT. The vehicle experiments showed PNCNO to be sub- stantially higher (-80-90) in gasoline engines than in a diesel engine (-35), and that equivalence ratio, fuel- nitrogen concentration and EGR affected PNCNO in a multi-cylinder gasoline engine in the same manner as in the single-cylinder engine. 224</page><page sequence="206">831675-831680 The above experimental results could be rationalized on the basis of a speculative mechanism which incorporated the fuel-nitrogen reactions, the Zeldovich reactions and their interactions. 1983 SAE Transactions 831676. Conversion of fuel nitrogen to oxides of nitrogen in an automotive gas turbine. L. William Huell- mantel and James G. Matson, General Motors Research Laboratories. Engine and chassis dynamometer tests were conducted us- ing the GMR GT-225 experimental automotive gas turbine engine to determine the effect of fuel nitrogen on NOx emissions. Kerosene doped with pyridine was used as fuel and both a conventional diffusion-flame combustor and an experimental lean, premixing-prevaporizing combustor were tested. The results show that a sizable amount of fuel nitrogen is converted to NOx with both combustors. The lean, premixing-prevaporizing combustor converted a grea- ter fraction of the fuel nitrogen than did the diffusion-flame combustor and for both combustors, the fraction converted decreased as the fuel nitrogen content increased. 831677. Modeling for mass burning rate and combustion duration in spark ignition engines using gasohol fuels. Robert P. Mueller, Cixun Li, and K. C. Tsao, University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, Mil- waukee, WI. This paper presents an analytical model for the prediction of mass burning rates and combustion duration via analysis of pressure versus time data, physical engine design param- eters, and the thermodynamic properties of the fuel. For model verification pressure and ion discharge traces were obtained for five methanol-gasoline blends burned in a sin- gle cylinder spark ignition engine. A new computational technique, built upon earlier Russian works, is presented to provide a more accurate model for the density of the com- bustion gases during combustion. The accuracy of the model predictions is substantiated through comparison with heat release data and flame front position data as recorded by ion discharge transducers. 831678. Natural gas storage on activated carbon. Amos Golovoy and Ed J. Blais, Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. Natural gas is a good fuel for internal combustion engines, but its low energy density is a significant drawback. The energy density can be increased by absorption on a high surface area activated carbon. But with usage, some of the constituents in the natural gas composition accumulate on the carbon and reduce its adsorptivity. The adsorption- desorption of natural gas on 9LXC activated carbon was investigated to 100 cycles at 21 °C and pressures of up to 12 MPa. The decrease in the capacity, G, as a function of the number of cycles, N, was found to follow the empirical correlation: G/G0 = 1 - 0.085Log(N). Analysis of the ac- tivated carbon after 100 cycles showed accumulation of C4 and higher hydrocarbons but not of C2 and C3. For automo- tive applications, activated carbon appears practical in a narrow pressure range, centering around 7 MPa (1000 psig). The preferred storage is at a pressure of 17 MPa or higher, without the use of activated carbons. 831679. Microoxidation evaluation of automotive crank- case oils. L. F. Cho, The Pennsylvania State Uni- versity, University Park, PA; Current affiliation: Mobil Research &amp; Development Corp. Paulsbo- ro, NJ; and E. E. Klaus, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA. The Penn State Microoxidation Tester coupled with gel permeation chromatography and clay column adsorption techniques has been demonstrated to be an effective tool to provide semi-quantitative analysis for automotive crankcase lubricant deterioration. This test simulates engine piston- cylinder zone high-temperature thin-film conditions. Oxida- tive behavior of a series of ASTM Sequence HID hot engine test reference oils (with unknown base stocks and additive packages) has been found to be comparable to and consist- ent with that of a model fluid formulated with a good quality conventionally refined heavy neutral and a simple additive system composed of phenyl alpha naphthylamine and zinc dialkyldithiophosphate. Further simplification of the test procedure for evaluating varnish and deposit forma- tion tendencies proves to be an effective aid in discriminat- ing base oils as well as compounded fluids with a minimum of analytical equipment. High temperature evaluations of a number of commercial multigrade engine oils reveal the slight advantage of synthetic over conventional mineral base oils both in terms of oxidation resistance and volatility loss. 831680. Comparative evaluation of several hydraulic fluids in operational equipment, a full-scale pump test stand, and the four-ball wear tester. E. E. Klaus, The Pennsylvania State University, Uni- versity Park, PA; and J. M. Perez, Caterpillar Tractor Company, Peoria, IL. A four-ball wear test has been designed and tested with a series of petroleum based hydraulic fluids. This test proce- dure comprises a sequence of three 30 minute test segments designed to evaluate "wear in," steady state wear and the effect of antiwear films produced in the first two parts of the test. Excellent repeatability of this sequential testing has been established. The wear properties of formulated fluids have been shown to be a function of system temperature and bearing load. A series of formulated mineral oil base lubricants that have been evaluated extensively in heavy-duty industrial hydraulic equipment have also been evaluated in a labora- tory pump test system and the sequential four-ball wear test. A correlation developed for the heavy-duty industrial hydraulic systems with the laboratory pump test system has 225</page><page sequence="207">831680-831686 been extended to the four-ball wear tester sequential runs under specific load and temperatures. 831681. Condition monitoring of crankcase oils using computer aided infrared spectroscopy. J. P. Coates and L. C. Setti, Perkin-Elmer Corp. Infrared spectroscopy is one of the most fundamental tools of analysis available, and it has the ability to provide most, if not all, of the data required from a used lubricant. In the past successful, yet superficial, application of the technique has been made for condition monitoring of oils during serv- ice. The full potential of the application, however, has been limited by the inability to access the total information con- tent of the infrared spectrum. Modern computer-assisted instrumentation now provides the sensitivity and the means to extract the data. This paper will describe the technique and will illustrate how it can be applied to the analysis of used lubricants. 831682. Thermogravimetric analysis of lubricants. S. M. Hsu and A. L. Cummings, National Bureau of Standards, Washington, DC. A novel thermogravimetric analysis test method has been developed for the evaluation of lubricants. It involves super- imposing the thermogravimetric trace of the sample in ar- gon over the trace produced in oxygen atmosphere. The difference of the two traces indicates the oxidative influence on volatility as well as on the formation tendencies of high boiling (high molecular weight) oxidation products. The method was illustrated with a base oil with and without a catalyst package and an additive package. The test method is potentially useful for lubricant screening, quality control, and base oil composition effects on thermal oxidative stabil- ity. 831683. Interactions of additives and lubricating base oils. S. M. Hsu, National Bureau of Standards, Washington, DC; and R. S. Lin, (NBS Guest Worker) Chinese Petroleum Corp., Taiwan. Automotive lubricating oils consist of base oils and a vari- ety of chemical additivs. In this study, interactions among an antioxidant (ZDDP), a dispersant (succinimide), and a detergent (calcium sulfonate) are studied in terms of oxida- tion stability. Oxidation tests were conducted at 60°C and 160°C using the free radical titration test and the thin film oxygen uptake test respectively. Complex chemical interac- tions in terms of oxidation stability were found among the additives, as well as the additives with the polar species in the base oil. Optimum oxidation concentrations for some of the additives were observed. The effects of temperatures on the interaction were also described. 831684. Inhibition of oxidation by ZDTP and ashless an- tioxidants in the presence of hydroperoxides at 160°C - Part I. Milton D. Johnson, Stefan Korcek, and Mikio Zinbo, Ford Motor Co., Re- search Staff, Dearborn, MI. A reaction scheme depicting engine oil oxidation chemistry occurring in internal combustion engines is proposed. This scheme reflects the idea that hydroperoxides, which are initial oxidation products, are formed continuously in en- gine oil, regardless of the presence of radical trapping inhi- bitors, due to a continuous influx of free radicals from the combustion process. Therefore, the antioxidant behavior of a zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDTP) itself and in combi- nation with an ashless phenolic antioxidant has been in- vestigated using a model hydrocarbon oxidation system in the presence of excess hydroperoxides. In order to approxi- mate temperatures existing in critical engine locations, these studies were carried out at 160°C. Results obtained contribute to a better understanding of the antioxidant mechanisms of ZDTP and also provide basic information needed in development of laboratory test procedures for evaluation of engine oil antioxidant systems under realistic conditions. 831685. Alternative fuels for spark-ignition engines. R. H. Thring, Southwest Research Institute. Toward the end of this century the shortfall of supply below demand of the products of natural crude oil will become severe. Research is already well under way to provide alter- native fuels for spark-ignition engines which will be inde- pendent of natural crude oil. These include fuels from oil shales and tar sands, as well as synthetic fuels, alcohols, and gases; sources include coal, natural gas and biological ori- gins. These fuels will cost two to three times as much in real terms as gasoline from oil does now, so an even stronger emphasis on fuel economy will be required. Most of these alternative fuels are more suited to the spark-ignition engine than the compression-ignition engine, and this paper pre- dicts that the changeover to them will cause an increase rather than a decrease in the market penetration of the spark-ignition engine. It is concluded that the alternative fuel most likely to gain general acceptance is synthetic gaso- line made from coal or natural gas, or in some areas from agricultural by-products. 1983 SAE Transactions 831686. Engine and vehicle concepts for methanol- gasoline blends. Holger Menrad, Volkswagen Re- search, Wolfsburg, Germany; and Bernd Nier- hauve, Aral AG, Bochum, Germany. Blending methanol (MEOH) into gasoline results in the variation of the fuel properties, which are partially signifi- cant for the vehicle performance. Based on the modified fuel, necessary changes in the engine-vehicle concept are discussed including variations in the characteristics of the cars. Several steps of blending rates are considered: Low 226</page><page sequence="208">831686-831690 percentage in present production gasoline vehicles, medium rate up to 15% and high values up to 60% in modified concepts. The most influencing factor proves to be the material compatibility, followed by hot driving problems (vapor lock). Experiences with prototypes are discussed as well as larger test programs, e.g. the German Methanol Program with 1000 M 15 vehicles. 1983 SAE Transactions 831687. Characteristics of primed methanol fuels for passenger cars. Jerome Panzer, Exxon Research and Engineering Co. In addition to the use of volatile primers to provide metha- nol fuels with good cold starting characteristics, an addi- tional component is needed for luminosity of methanol flames. Methanol fuels have been prepared with several volatile primers to provide improved cold starting charac- teristics. Dimethyl ether, which can be readily made from methanol, appears to be superior in several respects to other primers because it imparts adequate volatility at reasonably low concentrations and can tolerate water contamination without volatility changes or phase separation better than hydrocarbon primers. Hydrocarbon components have been identified that provide adequate luminosity to methanol fuel flames. Estimates of vapor flammability indicate that dimethyl ether primed methanol fuels can be made whose vapor is too rich to burn in confined tankage at least down to -20°C. The upper flammability temperature of isopen- tane primed methanol can be close to that of gasoline (-30°C), but the isopentane solutions are sensitive to water contamination. Primed methanol experiences greater vola- tility loss than gasoline during storage and use in vehicle tanks and carburetors. Greater evaporative emissions were also observed. Primers in the concentration range 0-15 vol- ume percent appear to have no effect on octane quality in the CFR engine. Dimethyl ether seems not to aggravate methanol's preignitoin tendency. 1 983 SAE Transactions 831688. Performance of the supercharged spark ignition hydrogen engine. B.

A combustion engine of a given displacement will develop less power when running on hydrogen compared to gasoline or natural gas operation due to less heating value of the fuel air mixture in the combustion chamber. This drop in output exists for external mixing of hydrogen and air prior to in- take valve closure. However, external mixing does not re- quire intricate engine modification. Without substantial in- vestment, supercharging is an effective method to increase the output of a hydrogen engine which uses the simple technique of external mixing of hydrogen and air. AVL stationary type research engine was used to in- vestigate the percentage gain in output and thermal effi- ciency, knock limited combustion air ratios, NO emission and combustion characteristics at different supercharging pressures. The performance of the supercharged hydrogen engine is also compared with that of naturally aspirated hydrogen engine. Results indicate that compared to naturally aspirated hydrogen engine the output increases as much as 233% and the percentage increase in indicated thermal efficiency is 29% at a combustion air ratio of 2.0 and speed of 1200 rpm. By supercharging the hydrogen engine, NO emission in- creases and knock limit sets in at combustion air ratio leaner than that of naturally aspirated engine. Reduced spark plug gap and better insulation of ignition system are necessary to avoid the ignition failure at supercharged con- dition of hydrogen engine. 831689. Measuring the effect of oil viscosity on oil film thickness in engine journal bearings. J. A. Spearot, C. K. Murphy, and R. C. Rosenberg, General Motors Research. The minimum oil-film thickness in the front main bearing of a 3.8 L, V-6 engine was measured at 3 000 r/min, and 140 N°3Hm using an electrical resistance technique. For a series of seven Newtonian, single-grade oils, film thickness correlated with oil viscosity measured either in a kinematic or in a high-shear-rate viscometer. For a series of fifteen polymer-containing, non-Newtonian, multigrade oils, however, no single measure of viscosity adequately corre- lated with film thickness for all the oils. By eliminating four multigrade oils from the combined single and multigrade data sets, it was possible to correlate film thickness to the viscosity (of the remaining multigrade and Newtonian oils) measured at 150°C and 5 X 105 s'1, conditions which are believed to be representative of temperatures and shear rates in bearing oil films. Possible explanations for the lack of correlation with the entire set of twenty-two oils are discussed. 1983 SAE Transactions 831690. The effect of lubricant elasticity on journal bear- ing performance under static load. N. Van Os, C. A. Garcia-Franco, W. G. Gottenberg, and H. A. Tripp, Shell Development Co. This paper presents experimental measurements of oil film thickness for a statically loaded journal bearing with single- grade, polymer-free engine oils and SAE 10W40 polymer- containing engine oils under hydrodynamic lubrication con- ditions. Measured minimum film thickness was correlated with a bearing Sommerfeld number based on actual high shear rate viscosities with no significant difference being observed between polymer-free and polymer-containing oils. How- 227</page><page sequence="209">831690-831697 ever, a significant decrease in bearing attitude angle was observed for a number of polymer-containing oils compared with polymer-free oils at the same Sommerfeld number. Using measured values for eccentricity, attitude angle and high shear rate viscosities, the total friction couple was calculated at various Sommerfeld numbers with no differ- ence being found between polymer-containing and polymer- free oils. This was expected since theoretically the contri- bution to friction due to attitude angle is small compared with that due to viscosity. 831691. Oil film thickness in a bearing of a fired engine part III: the effects of lubricant rheology. F. Gir- shick and R. C. Craig, Exxon Research and Engi- neering Co., Linden, New Jersey. This is the third interim report describing oil film thickness measurements in a bearing of a fired single cylinder engine. The minimum oil film thickness (MOFT) in the front main crankshaft bearing of a fired CLR (Cooperative Lu- bricants Research) engine has been measured using a capac- itance technique. The effects of base stock viscosity, VI improver type and concentration, and finished oil viscosity at both high and low shear rates are presented and discussed. Five VI improvers are compared, and are found to have varying degrees of effectiveness in increasing MOFT in a given for- mulation and base stock. The shear rate and temperature of the viscosity measurement are found to affect the overall correlation between MOFT and oil viscosity. 831694. Lean combustion in spark-ignited internal com- bustion engines - a review. Geoff J. Germane and Carl G. Wood, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Brigham Young University; and Clay C. Hess, National Engineering Laboratory, Idaho Falls, ID. Lean combustion in spark-ignition engines has long been recognized as a means of both improving engine efficiency and lowering carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen ex- haust emissions. In this paper, the fundamentals of lean combustion are reviewed in terms of lean flammability and ignition, and lean misfire limit, from a compilation of re- search results. Over 100 references are included in the re- view. The effect of lean mixture on engine efficiency, per- formance and exhaust emissions is discussed. The effects of engine variables on lean combustion are presented, including mixture preparation, ignition, combustion cham- ber shape, compression rates and fuel additives. Techniques for lean burn engine control and emissions clean-up are also described. 831695. Incomplete combustion in one-end-open crevices. K. T. Rhee and S. L. Chang, Department of Me- chanical and Aerospace Engineering, Rutgers - The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ. The present paper considers the processes of incomplete combustion in in-cylinder crevices with clearances slightly greater than quenching distance. For this, an experimental work has been carried out by using a premixed constant- volume combustion chamber. In the chamber, the propaga- tion of flame through the combustible gas contained in individual crevices with various geometries was investigated by two means: high speed schlieren photography to obtain the idiosyncrasy of the in-crevice flame behavior; and fast- response thin-film thermocouples mounted flush with the crevice wall to measure the flame propagation speed, the instantaneous surface temperature, the instantaneous heat flux through the crevice wall, etc. From the investigation, the origins of unburned hydrocarbons formed in the in- cylinder crevices were surmised. In addition, an improved numerical method is presented for the computation of heat flux through a slab (here, the crevice wall) by using the timed surface temperature measured by the thin-film thermo-couple. 1983 SAE Transactions 831696. Observation of knock using a high speed shutter TV camera system. Yoshihiro I washita, Toyota Motor Corp.; and Akinori Saito, Toyota Central Research and Development Labs., Inc. An ultra-high speed shutter TV camera including an image intensifier which has a light magnification of 20,000, and an image analysis system have been developed and applied to knock research with a transparent piston engine. Irregular- ity in the flame configuration was observed just when the pressure vibration began. The causes of cycle to cycle varia- tion of knock intensity were examined through the simulta- neous recording of the pressure vibration and the image of the flame. 1983 SAE Transactions 831697. Measurements and predictions of the precom- bustion fluid motion and combustion rates in a spark ignition engine. Peter O. Witze, Sandia Na- tional Laboratories, Livermore, CA; and Jay K. Martin and Claus Borgnakke, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. Laser Doppler velocimeter results are presented for the mean velocity and turbulence intensity measured in a mo- tored research engine. The compression of complex bulk motions created during induction produces turbulence as the piston approaches top dead center. The turbulence field is shown to be isotropic but nonhomogeneous. A zero- dimensional computer simulation based on an averaged k-€ model is shown to adequately predict the decay of turbu- lence at a point in the flow after the production phase is completed. Cylinder pressure measurements were recorded for ho- mogeneous stoichiometric combustion for a range of engine speeds and ignition locations. A two-zone (burned and un- burned gases) thermodynamic model accurately predicts 228</page><page sequence="210">831697-831702 the measured pressure histories when the turbulence results determined from the motored tests are used to establish ini- tial conditions for the combustion model. 1983 SAE Transactions 831698. Light duty vehicle CO emissions during cold weather. Thomas C. Austin and Gary S. Ruben- stein, Sierra Research; and Leonard D. Verrelli and Thomas E. Moyer, Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. Recent tests conducted by the Alaska Department of Envi- ronmental Conservation and low ambient temperature tests previously conducted by a variety of other organizations indicate that less progress is being achieved in the control of emissions during cold weather than under temperatures similar to those used during EPA certification testing. Al- though CO emission standards dropped from 15 grams per mile to 7 grams per mile between 1975 and 1981, far less of a change occurred in CO emissions from new vehicles at 20°F. Cold start CO emissions at 20°F are about 60 grams per mile for late model cars at low mileages. The available test data on these cars seem to indicate that results achieved using the standard emission test procedure are poorly corre- lated with emissions at lower temperatures. However, the low temperature CO emissions of cars certified at 3.4 grams per mile CO are nearly 50% lower than vehicles certified to a standard of 15 grams per mile. The benefits of the 3.4 gram CO standard on low tempera- ture emission control appears to be due to the fact that manufacturers have been induced to use systems which are much more effective in reducing the degree of mixture en- richment needed during cold start operation. Test data indicate that cold temperature emission per- formance from cars equipped with fuel injection systems are clearly superior to most carburetor equipped cars. How- ever, comparable levels of low temperature CO control may be possible with carburetors through the use of electric intake manifold heating grids. Unless new regulations pro- vide an alternative mechanism for encouraging the use of such systems, the achievement of the ambient air quality standard for CO in areas which experience violations dur- ing cold weather may depend on the continued requirement for a 3.4 gram per mile standard. 831699. The effectiveness of Colorado's AIR Program on principal emission control technologies: model years 1968-1982. Jerry Gallagher and Michael J. O'Toole, Air Pollution Control Div., Colorado Department of Health; and Melvyn C. Branch, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Univer- sity of Colorado. Automobiles and other mobile sources are a major contrib- utor to precursors of ozone and to carbon monoxide in urban area air pollution inventories. In a typical urban area, over fifty (50) percent of the emissions of hydrocarbons (HC) and of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), which react in the presence of sunlight to form ozone, are derived from vehic- ular sources. Over ninety (90) percent of the carbon mon- oxide emissions in these areas are also attributable to mobile sources. This problem is accentuated in the Front Range Region of Colorado, due to the higher altitude. The Colo- rado Automobile Inspection and Readjustment (AIR) Pro- gram was designed and implemented in an effort to reduce the contributions to ambient air pollution from mobile sources. The intent of this study is to evaluate whether there is a difference in the effectiveness of the Colorado AIR Program on the major technological groups of emis- sions control configurations. 831700. Comparison of steady-state and transient CVS cycle emissions of an automotive Stirling engine. Roger A. Farrell and Richard J. Bolton, Mechan- ical Technology, Inc. One of the goals of the Automotive Stirling Engine Devel- opment Program, sponsored by the Department of Energy and managed by NASA/Lewis Research Center, is to de- velop a rationale for predicting transient CVS cycle emis- sions from steady-state engine data. A technique is devel- oped that integrates engine emissions as a function of fuel flow over a modelled CVS cycle to predict vehicle urban cycle results. Steady-state emissions data from three Mod I engines burning unleaded gasoline are used to predict vehi- cle NO2, CO, and HC emissions. A total of 155 data points representing variations in engine power, excess air (X), and the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) schedule are utilized. Predictions are then compared to the results of nine urban CVS cycle tests of the Mod I/Lerma vehicle, and a con- clusion is reached that very accurate predictions of vehicle NOx emissions are possible. CO and HC emissions are con- siderably higher than predicted due to extreme sensitivity of CO emissions to Lambda, the effect of heater head tempera- ture, and failure of the engine to accurately reflect emis- sions during start-up. 831701. Lubrication experience in methanol-fueled en- gines under short-trip service conditions. William B. Chamberlin and Warren C. Brandów, The Lubrizol Corp. In order to assess the field needs of engine oils to be used in methanol-fueled vehicles, six oils were run in a fleet test over a ten-month period under short-trip service conditions. The results from the field test were compared with results with the six oils in the laboratory engine tests which have been used to predict field performance with methanol fuel. A lack of correlation between the field test and the labora- tory engine tests suggests that the laboratory tests need revisions to better serve field needs. 831702. The effects of lubricant composition on S.I. en- gine wear with alcohol fuels. H. W. Marbach, Jr., E. A. Frame, E. C. Owens, and D. W. Naegeli, U.S. Army Fuels and Lubricants, Research Labo- 229</page><page sequence="211">831702-831706 ratory, Southwest Research Institute; and B. D. Wielgos, Texaco Inc. An investigation of the effects of lubricant composition changes on spark ignition engine wear and deposits when using alcohol fuel was jointly sponsored by the U.S. De- partment of Energy and the U.S. Army Mobility Equip- ment Research and Development Command. In the work covered by this paper, tests were conducted with methanol fuel in a 2.3-liter engine using a modified ASTM Sequence V-D procedure. The baseline lubricant was a 10W-30 grade product, qualified under MIL-L-46152, for which a large amount of field and laboratory data were available. Eleven variations of the baseline lubricant were supplied and test- ed. The results indicate that a magnesium-based detergent additive was less effective in controlling methanol-related engine wear than was a calcium-based additive. Ashless dispersant chemistry was also determined to be of impor- tance in controlling wear with methanol fuel. Experiments were conducted to identify the wear mechanism using the 2.3-liter engine, 20-hour steady-state test. This 20-hour test shows promise as a lubricant screening procedure when using methanol fuel. 831703. Engine and field test evaluation of methanol as an automotive fuel. T. M. Naman and B. C. Striegl- er, Conoco Inc. A nine-car fleet test was conducted over a one year period to evaluate liquid and vaporized methanol as internal- combustion engine fuels in retrofitted 2.3-liter L4 gasoline engines. In addition, modified ASTM Sequence V-D engine tests were conducted on selected oil formulations of SF and SF/CC quality to determine their overall performance with methanol. It was found that severe engine upper-cylinder bore wear is likely to occur with current SF and SF/CC-type formulations in vehicles driven in short-trip, stop-and-go urban cycles. Normal engine wear was observed in vehicles driven mostly at highway speeds. The idle time following a cold start, appeared to have a direct effect on engine wear. Liquid and vaporized methanol showed similar results. En- gine varnish with either liquid or vaporized methanol, was significantly better than with gasoline. 831704. Methanol engine durability. Robert J. Ernst, Al- cohol Energy Systems, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA; Ri- chard K. Pefley, Mechanical Engineering Dept., University of Santa Clara, Santa Clara, CA; and F. Jerry Wiens, California Energy Commission, Sacramento, CA. Engine durability refers to the ability of an engine to func- tion properly and reliably over an extended period of time. Engine durability is a major remaining technical hurdle prior to expanding the use of methanol fuel. This paper will present engine durability data derived from the California Energy Commission's continuing Alcohol Fleet Test Pro- gram, review this data in relationship to previously reported engine durability information, discuss some of the possible reasons for observed effects, and suggest design considera- tions for further improvement in methanol engine durabil- ity. 831705. Fundamental volatility/driveability characteris- tics of oxygenated gasolines at high underbonnet temperatures. F. H. Palmer and G. J. Lang, Brit- ish Petroleum p.l.c. Much interest is currently being shown in the use of high octane organic oxygenated compounds as gasoline compo- nents, particularly with increasing pressure to lower lead levels. Such usage focuses attention on sensitive areas of vehicle performance like for example, hot weather vehicle driveability/fuel volatility. To compare the hot fuel handling characteristics of oxygenated fuels with motor gasoline, a series of tests has been carried out on a chassis dynamometer using a variety of European cars and more than 70 different fuels. The fuel compounds assessed included Methanol, Ethanol, Tertiary Butyl Alcohol (TBA) and Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) blended individually and in combination at up to 25 percent volume concentration with motor gasoline. Initial analyses of the dynamometer data showed, un- der severe operating conditions (e.g. at and above 35°C ambient air temperature), certain oxygenate types to disad- vantage and indicated that existing gasoline volatility crite- ria were inadequate to predict the driveability performance of oxygenated fuels. However, further laboratory tests to study the fundamental relationship between temperature and fuel vapour pressure characteristics, together with sup- plementary road driveability trials, have led to the belief that excessive vehicle fuel system temperatures are largely responsible for the unexpected/undesirable behaviour of some oxygenate supplements. The authors conclude that vehicle fuel system tempera- tures must not be allowed to rise excessively otherwise there will be a deterioration in the driveability performance of oxygenated fuels and new volatility specification criteria will be required. These could include a determined va- pour/liquid ratio measurement or a vapour pressure control at much higher temperature levels than is currently speci- fied for Reid vapour pressure. 831706. Road trials to assess the hot weather driveability characteristics of gasolines containing oxygen- ates in European cars. F. H. Palmer, British Pe- troleum p.l.c.; and A. Tontodonati, Assoreni/ENI. With the growing use of oxygenates as gasoline supple- ments, there is an increasing need to establish how such fuels will perform in cars in the market, particularly with respect to their impact on existing gasoline specifications and vehicle fuel system design. 230</page><page sequence="212">831706-831710 One area which is attracting considerable attention at the present time is vehicle/fuel driveability performance, especially since oxygenates, when blended with gasoline, have a tendency to increase volatility as well as octane num- ber. It is essential therefore that fuel volatility criteria and limits are established for gasolines containing oxygenated components. Road trials have recently been carried out in Italy with the aim of identifying the hot weather driveability character- istics of a wide range of fuels and cars. The oxygenate types assessed included methanol and 50/50 blends of methanol and tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) in blend with gasoline at concentration levels of up to 15 per cent volume and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) at concentrations of up to 20 percent volume, at different levels of volatility. Whilst oxygenate concentrations had little effect on driveability performance, there were differences in perform- ance between oxygenate types. For example, in some cars gasolines containing methanol/TBA were shown to advan- tage over all other fuels tested, even gasoline. On the other hand, fuels with methanol gave inferior performance in some cars. On an overall basis, however, fuels containing methanol, methanol/TBA or MTBE were considered to perform equally as well as gasoline although the rating char- acteristics displayed by the methanol blends in some cars could, if widespread, impose difficulties in setting volatility specifications. The authors conclude that methanol alone or metha- nol/TBA in blend with gasoline at concentration levels of up to 15 percent volume, or MTBE up to 20 percent volume concentration should give acceptable hot weather driveabil- ity performance if fuels are manufactured to existing gaso- line specifications. Of perhaps greater interest is that use of methanol/TBA may even offer benefits over non oxygen- ated gasoline in some cars in the form of improved perform- ance. 1983 SAE Transactions 831707. Vapor lock in late model cars. R. K. Riley, Phil- lips Petroleum Co., Bartlesville, OK. Twenty cars of the model years 1978 to 1982 were tested for their vapor lock characteristics using the CRC Vapor Lock Procedures. These cars represent the more popular combi- nations of models/engines for the included years. The tests were run at 70F, 85F, and 100F to cover the normal range of maximum temperatures at which vapor lock problems occur. The gasoline blends used in the test program were also compositionally varied to include both fuels pressur- ized by butane and those pressurized by isopentane. Results of this study show late model cars generally to be more able to handle hot fuels without experiencing vapor lock than vehicles of the mid-1960s, the latest vehicles for which comparable data were available. The results also sug- gest that some revision to the volatility classes in ASTM D-439 Standard Specification for Automotive Gasoline should be considered. In particular, the large jumps in vola- tility at different ambient temperatures allowed under ASTM D-439 do not match the changes in fleet vapor lock sensitivity to ambient temperature. Additional volatility classes would allow a better matching of fuels to vehicle needs. 831708. Throttle body deposits - the CRC carburetor cleanliness test procedure. J. J. Malakar, The Lubrizol Corp.; J. B. Retzloff, Ethyl Corp.; and L. M. Gibbs, Chevron Research Co. A nine-year effort from 1972 to 1981 was undertaken by the Coordinating Research Council Carburetor Test Procedure Panel to develop a laboratory engine test method for eval- uating the effects of gasolines on the formation of throttle body deposits. This paper summarizes the test development, discusses effects of engine operating conditions on test se- verity, gives data on fuel effects, and presents a final test procedure that uses a removable carburetor throttle bore sleeve to permit weighing of deposits. A carburetor visual rating procedure was also developed. The final engine test procedure has proved to be an effective in-house tool for screening fuels and additives. An unresolved problem is poor interlaboratory reproducibility. 831709. A gasoline additive concentrate removes com- bustion chamber deposits and reduces vehicle oc- tane requirement. J. A. Bert, J. A. Gething, T. J. Hansel, H. K. Newhall, R. J. Peyla, and D. A. Voss, Chevron Research Co. Combustion chamber deposits accumulate in a new gasoline engine and can result in an octane requirement increase (ORI) of as much as 8 to 10 octane numbers. In some cases, a higher octane fuel is required to prevent engine knock (detonation). A unique new additive concentrate has been developed which reduces combustion chamber deposits and lowers the engine's octane requirement. This new additive is an ashless dispersant based on polyether amine chemistry. Laboratory and fleet test results show that after using one tankful of gasoline treated with additive, the engine's octane require- ment is typically reduced by 30% to 40% of the original engine ORI. This benefit lasts for several thousand kilome- ters until the deposits reestablish themselves in the com- bustion chamber. In addition to the octane requirement decrease (ORD) effect, other benefits from the use of this additive include engine run-on reduction and intake system deposit cleanup. Discussion: L. B.

Time-resolved sampling was used to measure hydrocarbon concentration profiles in the exhaust of a small, high-speed, direct-injection diesel engine in an effort to determine sig- 231</page><page sequence="213">831710-831714 nificant sources of hydrocarbon emissions. The engine was a single-cylinder design with a 0.53-L displacement and a swirl-supported, high-pressure-injection combustion sys- tem. In the past, most sampling work performed on diesel engines has been done in the cylinder and has focused on either oxides of nitrogen or soot emissions. The exhaust sampling done in this study provided a simple yet informa- tive means of studying hydrocarbon emissions. Results from this study for wide ranges of engine speed and air-fuel ratio showed a single peak in the hydrocarbon concentration pro- file as a function of crank angle. Phasing of the hydrocarbon concentration peak generally coincided with the blowdown period of the exhaust event. Because the mass flow rate of the exhaust is high during blowdown, the contribution of unburned hydrocarbons exhausted during this period to to- tal hydrocarbon mass emissions of the engine was signifi- cant; from 36 to 60 percent of the total HC mass emission, depending on air-fuel ratio. From these results it was con- cluded that, except at light load, fuel issuing from the sac volume of the injector late in the cycle was a significant source of unburned hydrocarbons in the exhaust. 1983 SAE Transactions 831711. The effect of operating conditions on the effluent of a wall-flow monolith particulate trap. J. Scott MacDonald, General Motors Research Laborato- ries. An experimental study was conducted to characterize the aerosol that passes through a wall-flow monolith trap and to determine how the trap performance varies with engine operating condition. Steady-state experiments conducted with a 5.7-L diesel engine operating at several test conditions showed that the wall-flow trap collected nearly all of the carbonaceous par- ticulate material, regardless of the operating condition. However, the ability of the trap to collect the volatile par- ticulate material was dependent upon the exhaust gas tem- perature. Particle size measurement showed that significant con- centrations of small, nuclei-mode particles exist down- stream of the filter at some engine operating conditions. The quantity of nuclei-mode particles was shown to be dependent primarily upon exhaust gas temperature. With- out the exhaust filter, the concentration of these small parti- cles was generally negligible. These small particles are of paticular interest since they are capable of penetrating dee- ply into the human pulmonary system. 1983 SAE Transactions 831712. Comparison of petroleum and alternate-source diesel fuel effects on light-duty diesel emissions. Bruce B. Bykowski, Charles T. Hare, and Robert L. Mason, Southwest Research Institute; and Thomas M. Baines, Environmental Protection Agency. Exhaust emission data from several fuel effects studies were normalized and subjected to statistical analyses. The goal of this work was to determine whether emission effects of property variation in alternate-source fuels were similar, less pronounced, or more pronounced than the effects of property variation in petroleum fuels. A literature search was conducted, reviewing hundreds of studies and finally selecting nine which dealt with fuel property effects on emissions. From these studies, 15 test cases were reported. Due to the wide variety of vehicles, fuels, test cycles, and measurement techniques used in the studies, a method to relate them all in terms of general trends was developed. Statistics and methods used included bivariate correlation coefficients, regression analysis, scattergrams and goodness- of-fit determinations. Insertion of alternate-source fuel properties into exhaust emissions prediction equations based on petroleum fuel results indicated that the effects of alternate-source fuel property changes on exhaust emissions were statistically indistinguishable from those associated with petroleum fuels. 831713. Trap-oxidizer technology for light-duty diesel ve- hicles: status, prospects, and current issues. Christopher Weaver, Energy and Resource Con- sultants, Inc. Current U.S. Environmental regulations will limit particu- late emissions by light duty diesel automobiles and trucks to 0.2 and 0.26 grams per mile respectively, beginning in 1987. Barring some breakthrough, attainment of these emissions levels will require the use of trap-oxidizers on all but the smallest vehicles. This paper reviews the present state of the art in trap-oxidizer technology and examines the require- ments which a trap-oxidizer system would have to meet in order to be installed and marketed in production vehicles. The tasks remaining to be accomplished in the development of commercially feasible trap-oxidizer systems are briefly discussed. It is concluded that trap technology is quite ad- vanced, with at least two apparently feasible types of partic- ulate traps now available. The remaining tasks in develop- ing a commercial trap-oxidizer system involve the development of improved trap regeneration systems and the development of automatic controls for the regeneration process. Three promising trap/regeneration system combi- nations are identified and discussed in detail. 831714. Better prediction of engine oil pumpability through a more effective MRV cooling cycle. Marvin F. Smith, Jr., Exxon Chemical Co., PA- RAMINS Technology Div. The Mini-Rotary Viscometer (MRV), adopted by SAE in 1980 to predict engine oil pumpability, was unable to fail certain commercial oils that caused engine problems in the winter of 1980-81. The latter oils did fail in the seven-day Federal Stable Pour, Cycle C, Test (FSPCCT). A special study of the FSPCCT temperature cycle in the MRV high- lighted the importance of a slow cooldown rate in the tem- 232</page><page sequence="214">831714-831719 perature range of engine oil cloud points. Using this princi- ple, a modified one-day MRV test was developed that fails 1980-81 problem oils. Further modification, however, was required to detect a newly discovered problem oil, PRO-29. Failure-prone oils discovered since 1980 are very sensitive to subtle changes in cooling rate and temperature regime. As the industry proceeds to develop a more effective MRV test, a better insight into the pumpability problems of 1980-81 has been gained. 831715. Low-temperature performance advantages for oils using hydrodewaxed base stocks. C. N. Rowe and J. A. Murphy, Mobil Research &amp; Develop- ment Corp. Single and multigrade engine oils formulated with catalytic hydrodewaxed (MLDW) base stocks possess low- temperature fluidity properties superior to counterpart products using conventional solvent dewaxed base stocks. This low-temperature benefit for MLDW oils is demon- strated in CCS and MRV viscosity measurements and cold engine cranking studies. This advantage is a natural conse- quence of the composition differences imposed by the re- spective dewaxing processes. The MLDW process is more selective and more efficient than solvent dewaxing in the removal of paraffins to reduce lube oil pour point. It follows that MLDW oils have fewer paraffins available for wax-gel formation at low temperatures. The lower paraffin content is also responsible for the lower VI values for the MLDW base stocks. Thus, the superior low-temperature perform- ance of MLDW oils is contrary to viscosity-temperature extrapolations. 831716. Low-temperature rheology of multigrade engine oils - formulary effects. J. E. Clevenger and H. F. Richards, Shell Development Co., Westhollow Research Center, Houston, TX. Several major U.S. engine manufacturers recently revised their factory-fill and service-fill engine oil specifications af- ter experiencing a number of engine failures related to low- temperature oil pumpability. Changes include lower limits on ASTM D97 pour point and adoption of stable pour point requirements as measured under cyclic low- temperature conditions. Factors such as base stock, VI im- prover, pour point depressant and detergent-inhibitor pack- age selection can have a pronounced effect on a fully formulated engine oil's low-temperature flow properties. It has been found that by a judicious combination of HVI and MVI base stocks, one can formulate multigrade engine oils with excellent low-temperature flow properties. Properly formulated oils can readily meet all of the current factory- fill and service-fill specifications, and are expected to mini- mize the possibility of any future low-temperature oil pum- pability related field problems. 831717. Low temperature starting and pumpability re- quirements of European automotive engines - part 2. M. Thompson, Mobil Oil Company Lim- ited; C. G. A. Von Eberan-Eberhorst, Deutsche BP AG; A. Rossi, Total; and H. Holdack- Janssen, Technical University, Hanover. Studies are continuing in Europe to define the low tempera- ture starting and pumpability requirements of automotive engines and to develop test procedures to predict lubricant performance under these conditions. A new liquid-bath Brookfield viscosity procedure has been shown to predict oil pumpability performance as accurately as the mini- rotary viscometer procedure and has been proposed for incorporation into SAE J300 as an alternative to ASTM D 3829. Round-robin testing of modified cold cranking simu- lator and mini-rotary viscometer methods has also been completed and a new CEC IGL-8 subgroup has been estab- lished to investigate the low temperature rheology of base oils currently available in Europe in order to define opti- mised cooling cycles for the liquid-bath Brookfield and mini-rotary viscometer techniques. Evaluation of engine oil performance at low temperatures in motored and fired en- gines at T.U. Hannover continues to indicate that engine design features may have a more significant impact on pum- pability performance than oil formulation. 831718. Low temperature fluidity of lubricating oils un- der slow cool conditions. G. M. Schmidt, M. T. Olsen, and M. I. Michael, John Deere Product Engineering Center, Waterloo, IA. A Slow Cool Fluidity Test (SCFT) was developed to detect gelation of oils. In this test, SAE 10W multigrade oils of known poor field experience solidified at temperatures ranging from -11 to -17°C. The test was based on field temperature histories, and was found to be more reliable than other standard and experimental industry tests in de- tecting gelation tendencies. The SCFT consists of a 0.1 0°C per hour cool from above the oil's cloud point to the lowest use temperature expected. Fluidity is determined by the time for the oil to flow 30 mm when a standard ASTM pour point test jar is turned from vertical to horizontal. The effect of additives such as pour point depressant type and quantity can be determined by utilizing the SCFT. 831719. Laboratory evaluation of Army multiviscosity grade tactical engine oils. A. F. Montemayor, E. C. Owens, E. A. Frame, and S. J. Lestz, U.S. Army Fuels and Lubricants Research Lab., Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, TX; and T. C. Bowen, U.S. Army Mobility Equip- ment, Research &amp; Development, Command (ME- RADCOM), Fort Belvoir, VA. Several multiviscosity grade oils were subjected to a special 240-hour endurance test procedure in an Army high-output two-cycle diesel engine, and certain of the oils were labora- tory tested in the Army's multifuel, four-cycle compression 233</page><page sequence="215">831719-831724 ignition engine and in the Army's air-cooled four-cycle die- sel tank engine. Certain of the lubricants were also subjected to standard hydraulic/power transmission tests because ac- ceptable power transmission performance will now be a for- mal requirement in the D-revision to the engine lubricant specification MIL-L-2104. Parallel to these laboratory eval- uations, pilot field tests were conducted in combat/tactical vehicles (engines and power shift transmissions) at three Army bases. The limited field tests indicated that the use of arctic/conventional multiviscosity grade lubricants at ambi- ent temperatures up to 38°C(100°F) may be possible, and their introduction under MIL-L-2104 should be pursued. Laboratory test results produced a suitable two-cycle diesel engine lubricants qualification test, and showed that SAE 15W-40 grade oils are acceptable for use in Army diesel- powered combat/tactical engine and power transmission fluid systems. Areas for continued lubricant development are outlined. 831720. Premature loss of oil consumption control in a heavy duty diesel engine. R. D. Hercamp, Cum- mins Engine Company, Inc. The effect of some engine operating condition variables on loss of oil consumption control is discussed. A 200 hour multi-cylinder diesel lab engine test procedure is described which has shown the ability to assess the relative perform- ance of lubricating oil formulations. The relationship of various parts rating measurements to oil consumption is shown. The detrimental effect of piston crownland deposits on oil consumption is demonstrated. 831721. Effect of piston deposits, fuel sulfur, and lubri- cant viscosity on diesel engine oil consumption and cylinder bore polishing. J. A. McGeehan, Chevron Research, Richmond, California. The purpose of this paper is to define the factors which affect oil consumption and cylinder bore polishing. The investigation focused on top land deposits, fuel sulfur, and lubricant viscosity in a series of direct-injection diesel en- gine tests in the U.S. and Europe. In these engine tests it was demonstrated that excessive top land deposits cause high oil consumption and cylinder bore polishing. Cylinder bore polishing can also be caused by corrosion when high sulfur fuels are used with oils of low alkalinity values. Maintenance of the Crosshatch honing pattern is critical to oil control, low ring wear, and preven- tion of ring scuffing. Low oil consumption and low cylinder bore polishing can be achieved with lubricant formulations which mini- mize the top land deposit and provide sufficient alkalinity to minimize the corrosive aspect of bore polishing. In addition to the top land deposit and fuel sulfur factors, multigrade oils showed a significant oil control ad- vantage in certain engines; and a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon is presented. 1983 SAE Transactions 831722. The effect of lubricating oil parameters on PC-1 type heavy duty performance. Alan A. Schetelich, Exxon Chemical Co., PARAMINS Technology Div. For the past thirty years duty diesel oil performance has been defined by the API CD category type tests. During this time the trend in CD oils has been toward lower ash and lower TBN. This has been largely due to the perform- ance improvements of ashless components which now form a major part of today's HD formulations. PC-1 type cate- gory testing indicates that ashless components will continue to be effective in meeting these higher heavy duty diesel targets. As a result, lower ash PC-1 type formulations are feasible. Oils have been developed using the dynamometer en- gine tests currently being worked with to define PC-1 to meet the target of improved oil consumption. These oils are also showing similar advantages in field performance test- ing over current CD/SF quality lubricants. 831723. Deposit control in the Caterpillar 1H2 engine test - a statistical approach to identifying engine oil component effects. R. D. Koller, R. A. Gal- luccio, and R. L. Stambaugh, Rohm and Haas Co. Developing engine oil formulations for today's marketplace requires a careful balance between cost and performance. Definition of optimized formulations requires detailed knowledge of the quantitative relationships between per- formance, or deposit control, and additive component con- centrations. To develop these relationships, a series of mul- tigrade engine oils formulated with two levels of a dispersant olefin copolymer VI improver were evaluated using the Caterpillar 1H2 engine test procedure. The per- formance package components and/or their levels in these oils were varied according to statistically designed, frac- tional factorial patterns. This approach provides an esti- mate of the effect of each component and their interactions. It also provides insight into the inherent test variability associated with TGF, WTD and the land and groove de- posits which make up these ratings. 831724. Diesel exhaust opacity: at the port and a meter downstream. Colin R. Ferguson, School of Me- chanical Engineering, Purdue University; Milt Chapman, S-Cubed; Hirofumi Kizawa, Komatsu, Ltd.; and Robin F. Nash, IBM. Instantaneous opacity measurements have been made for gases in the exhaust port and one meter downstream. The results obtained showed the opacity to be time independent, of negligible variation from cycle to cycle except near the smoke limit and an order of magnitude greater at the port than one meter downstream. Results are compared with gas sampling measurements of the particulates. 234</page><page sequence="216">831725-831731 831725. A time-dependent spatial model for radiant heat transfer in diesel engines. M. Chapman, M. C. Friedman, and A. Aghan, S-CUBED. We have developed a fully three-dimensional spatial model of the instantaneous radiation heat transfer in direct igni- tion diesel engines. The model is based on the assumption that the primary source of radiation is from the soot formed on the fuel-rich side of the combusting spray plumes. The model then calculates view-factors to the various regions from the evolving plume using a spray correlation model. The soot is assumed to be a grey body radiating through an optically thin medium to the relatively cool components of the combustion chamber. Preliminary calculations using the model indicate that there are significant spatial and temporal variations in the incident radiation on various regions in tjie combustion chamber. These calculations were performed for a geometry and operating conditions of a production turbocharged medium speed engine at full load conditions. 1983 SAE Transactions 831726. A fuel injection transducer and controller. Dan Oren, Syed Wahiduzzaman, and Colin R. Fer- guson, Purdue University, School of Mechanical Engineering. A fuel injection meter and controller has been developed which (1) measures the instantaneous injection rate and the total mass of fuel injected, and (2) controls the mass of fuel injected and injection pressure. The injection rate is com- puted from instantaneous measurements of the velocity of a pumping plunger and the pressure of fuel injection. A mathematical model of the meter and controller was developed to further the understanding of various design and operating parameters on the injection rate. Compressi- bility of the fuel is accounted for. Good agreement is real- ized between numerically computed injection pressure and rate histories with corresponding experimental results. 831727. Investigations of coal-derived liquid fuels in die- sel engines. D. H. Utvik, L. J. Spadaccini, and J. F. Jaminet, United Technologies Research Cen- ter. Results of a program conducted to investigate the operation of a medium-speed stationary diesel engine on coal-derived liquid (CDL) fuels are presented. The overall objectives of the program were to evaluate promising techniques for ef- fective utilization of three middle-distillate alternative fuels, namely SRC-II, Exxon Donor Solvent and H-Coal, without adversely affecting engine performance and operation, and to formulate control system algorithms. Investigations of fueling techniques such as on-line blending with diesel fuel, fumigation and the addition of ignition accelerants were conducted as well as investigations of such engine test vari- ables as injection timing and pressure, inlet air temperature and inlet air pressure (i.e., turbocharger boost). In general, it was concluded that diesel engine operation with CDL fuel blends is possible over a wide range of speed and load conditions. Strategies found useful for extending diesel en- gine operation with CDL fuels include fumigation, inlet air preheat, turbocharger boost and ignition accelerants. 831728. Interactions of direct-injection fuel sprays with in-cylinder air motions. David L. Harrington, Fluid Mechanics Dept., General Motors Re- search Labs., Warren, MI. An experimental investigation of the effects of injector type and orientation, engine speed, in-cylinder air swirl, com- pression pressure, and fuel type has been conducted in mo- tored visualization engines. A fuel-spray visualization sys- tem has been developed and utilized to obtain high-speed stroboscopie movies of the injection and penetration events. Significantly different interactions between the fuel spray and the in-cylinder air motions were found to result from changes in air-swirl ratio, nozzle geometry and injection timing. The maximum spray-tip velocity was found to oc- cur downstream from the injector tip for all conditions tested. For applications requiring minimum fuel-spray pen- etration, the impinging-jet injector was found to be the most promising candidate. Discussion: G.

This paper reviews a series of durability field performance tests that resulted in the development of an all-synthetic automotive SAE 75W-90 gear lubricant. The synthetic gear lubricant meets the requirements of API GL-5 and MIL-L- 2105C. The synthetic gear oil was field tested in heavy-duty truck axles including Rockwell SQHD and SQHP, Eaton DS-380, and Mack SW-34D models. In general, lubricant drain intervals were extended as high as 250,000 miles with parts inspections carried out at 100,000 to 500,000 miles. All axles inspected indicated that satisfactory lubrication was achieved. The parts analysis and oil inspection analysis are included in this paper. 831731. Durability testing of low viscosity borate gear lubricants. G. E. Callis, Oronite Additives Divi- sion, Chevron Chemical Company; and G. Y. Suh, Chevron Research Company. Vehicle tests under accelerated track and actual field serv- ice conditions were conducted using light duty and heavy duty trucks to evaluate the performance of borate additive technology in low viscosity gear lubricants. Earlier results in laboratory axle and bench tests showed superior EP and anti wear performance for low viscosity, SAE 75W, borate gear lubricants compared to SEA 75 W and higher viscosity, SAE 80W-90, conventional sulfurphosphorus gear lubri- cants. The vehicle results demonstrated that, through the use of borate gear lubricant additives, the inherent fuel 235</page><page sequence="217">831731 -831736 economy benefits of low viscosity gear lubricants can be realized while retaining gear and bearing durability in both light duty and heavy duty service environments. 831732. Impact of vehicle changes upon gear lubricant requirements. L. F. Schiemann and A. R. Ross, The Lubrizol Corp.; and R. Graham, Lubrizol International Laboratories. The authors provide evidence indicating that oils meeting only the minimum requirements of API GL-5 do not al- ways provide adequate gear protection, especially in severe duty applications. Increases in commercial vehicle power and loading have accentuated the need for oils of greater load carrying ability. A modified version of the standard L-37 test may help identify oils that possess superior dura- bility and thermal characteristics. Future gear lubricants should provide improved fuel economy, increased manual transmission life; and frictional characteristics that allow noise free performance in limited slip differentials. 831733. Relative roles of premixed and diffusion burning in diesel combustion. Steven L. Plee and Tan vir Ahmad, General Motors Research Laboratories. Relative roles of premixed and diffusion burning in diesel combustion have been examined in terms of characteristic times for ignition delay (rig), combustion (rc) and fuel-air mixing (rm). Results indicate that the majority of the diesel combustion process is diffusion controlled, as in gas turbine combustion, since rc &lt;^26 rm over the entire range of oper- ating conditions. During the ignition phase, some premixed burning can occur in the fringe of the fuel spray where Tm &lt; Tig; however, most of the fuel injected prior to igni- tion also burns in the diffusion mode, since rm &gt; rig in the majority of the fuel spray. The fraction of premixed burning which occurs during the ignition phase is increased by longer Tig, high rates of fuel injection, high air swirl and the use of multi-hole injectors, which increase the surface area of the spray. 1983 SAE Transactions 831734. Application of flame temperature correlations to emissions from a direct-injection diesel engine. Tanvir Ahmad and Steven L. Plee, General Mo- tors Research Laboratories. The influence of flame temperature on NOx, particulate and hydrocarbon emissions from a single-cylinder light- duty direct-injection diesel engine was examined by varying the composition of the intake air with the engine operating at different speeds and loads. At a fixed engine speed, load, and start-of-combustion timing, the effects of intake-gas composition on emissions were found to correlate with vari- ations in the characteristic diffusion flame temperature. Furthermore, this flame temperature dependence was not significantly affected by the engine operating conditions. These results indicate that the flame temperature correla- tions originally developed for divided-chamber diesel en- gines can be applied to direct-injection diesel engines. 1983 SAE Transactions 831735. A numerical study of the transient evaporating spray mixing process in the diesel environment. T.-W. Kuo, R. C. Yu, and S. M. Shahed, Cum- mins Engine Co., Inc. Some results of a systematic study of the effects of fuel and chamber gas properties on the transient evaporating spray mixing process are presented. The study uses an existing two-dimensional stochastic thick spray model. The results show that the combustion process in typical heavy duty, quiescent, DI diesel engines can be mixing limited rather than vaporization limited. In addition, the results show that the mixing process of a transient evaporating spray is char- acterized by the combined effects of fuel evaporation and its turbulent mixing with the surrounding air. In general, in- creasing the evaporation rate alone does not necessarily increase the fuel-air mixing rate. Furthermore, two dimen- sionless parameters have been used to quantify the relative effects of fuel and chamber gas properties on the transient spray evaporation process. Finally, through detailed com- parisons between spray and gas jet results, the transient evaporating spray mixing process is better understood. With this understanding, further modification of the phe- nomenological jet mixing model published earlier can and will be made. 1 983 SAE Transactions 831736. The influence of fuel properties and engine load upon the carbon and hydrocarbon fractions of particulate emissions from a light-duty diesel en- gine. Stephen P. Bergin, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories. This paper reports on the relative contributions of diesel fuel aromatic content and 90 percent distillation tempera- ture to particulate exhaust emissions (both carbon and hy- drocarbon) from a single-cylinder, indirect-injection, light- duty diesel engine as a function of engine load. The carbon and hydrocarbon fractions of particulates were determined by using a vacuum oven to heat filters on which particulates had been collected. As expected, multiple linear regression analysis showed that the carbon particulate emission index (grams of particulates emitted per kilogram of fuel consumed) cor- related well with a combination of aromatic carbon content and 90 percent distilled temperature of the eight fuels at all six loads tested. A new finding is that the relative contri- butions of these two fuel properties to the carbon particu- late emission index depended strongly upon engine load (overall equivalence ratio). A speculative explanation, which is consistent with the theory that carbonaceous soot condenses from rich gas-phase combustion, is proposed to account for the observation that increased levels of high- 236</page><page sequence="218">831736-831743 boiling fuel fractions decreased the carbon particulate emission index at very heavy engine loads. An unexpected finding was that within the normal ranges of diesel fuel properties, the hydrocarbon particulate emission index could not be correlated with fuel properties. In general agreement with other work, the hydrocarbon par- ticulate emission index for each fuel correlated with its cor- responding gaseous hydrocarbon emission index; however, the relationship between the gaseous and the particulate hydrocarbon emission indices was greatly dependent upon engine load. Data obtained using the same engine and con- stant fuel properties showed that the timing of combustion also strongly influenced the relationship between the gase- ous and the particulate hydrocarbon emission indices. 1983 SAE Transactions 831737. Destruction of oxygenate/odor formation in a high temperature flat flame burner. Nicholas P. Cernansky, Richard S. Cohen, and Prasad R. Tumati, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA. As a group of diesel engine exhaust products, oxygenates have been found primarily responsible for the characteristic exhaust odor. In diesel combustion systems, it is thought that oxygenates are produced in too-lean-to-burn regions and are subsequently destroyed in the high temperature flame regions*. In order to study these destruction processes, n-dodecane/oxygen/inert gas mixtures, have been burned in a high temperature premixed, prevaporized, one- dimensional, laminar flat flame burner. The rate of decay of oxygenates along the axis of the burner in the reaction zone and in the post flame zone has been measured and followed. An empirical relationship describing the rate of decay of oxygenates as rate = -k(T)[oxygenates]a[02]b has been de- rived. The reaction orders, a and b, have been found to be 0.91 ± 0.06 and 1.44 ± 0.05, respectively. The rate con- stant has Arrhenius parameters E = 23.95 ± 5.77 kcal/mol and logio A = 10.98 ± 1.56, where the units for A are discussed in the text. 831739. Computer data acquisition with statistical proc- essing in dynamometer testing of fuel efficient engine oils. Daniel H. Heath and Norman DiF- rancesco, Franklin Research Center, Philadel- phia, PA. Automated data acquisition and linear regression methods have enabled an analysis of test precision factors in mea- surements of brake specific fuel consumption for assessment of fuel efficient engine oils. Critical engine parameters were identified, controlled, and measured using a high resolution data acquisition system. With other critical parameters held within less than ±.03% of specified levels, air-fuel ratio was identified as the limiting factor in overall test error. A vari- ety of experiments involving back-to-back tests (including engine mapping sequences) with the ASTM 20W-30 refer- ence oil and calibration oils yielded overall test delta repeat errors between .19% and .56%. 831740. A proposal for an engine dynamometer procedure for evaluating the relative fuel efficiency of en- gine oils. R. A. Galluccio and R. D. Koller, Rohm and Haas Co. A multi-vehicle chassis dynamometer procedure for evalu- ating an engine oil for fuel economy effects has been ac- cepted by ASTM and the lubrication industry with reserva- tion. The reservation stems from the high test cost, the poor repeatability/reproducibility, and a concern that some additive chemistries are not being fairly evaluated. Recog- nizing these concerns, ASTM Committee D-2 has agreed to continue development work, but the thrust will now be toward a Sequence type, dynamometer engine test. The work which will be described here is part of statistically designed study intended to screen operating conditions and hardware for their effects on fuel efficiency and test reliabil- ity. Three ASTM FEEO oils were evaluted relative to the FEEO reference oil HR-2 in a 2.8 L V-6 engine. Correlation with results from the 5-car test development program will be presented, as well as the results of the analysis for oper- ating condition effects and sources of test variability. 831741. European test methods for fuel economy oils. K. P. Bush, D. C. Roberts, and T. Villis, Esso Re- search Centre, Abingdon, England. Europe is well aware of work by the ASTM Fuel Efficient Engine Oil Task Force to develop test procedures for the measurement of the effects of the engine oil on the fuel economy of passenger cars and light duty vehicles. These procedures are designed to cover North American require- ments and are not entirely suitable for European needs. The paper explains why separate European test methods are required for evaluating fuel economy oils and gives a status report on work by the Coordinating European Council to develop Codes of Practice for chassis dynamometer and fired engine dynamometer testing of fuel economy oils. 831743. Single-cylinder diesel engine study of four vege- table oils. M. J. Jacobus, S. M. Geyer, S. S. Lestz, and W. D. Taylor, The Pennsylvania State Uni- versity, University Park, PA; and T. H. Risby, The Johns Hopkins University. A single-cylinder, 0.36/, D.I. Diesel engine was operated on Diesel fuel, sunflowerseed oil, cottonseed oil, soybean oil, and peanut oil. The purpose of this study was to provide a detailed comparison of performance and emissions data and to characterize the biological activity of the particulate sol- uble organic fraction for each fuel using the Ames Salmonella typhimurium test. In addition, exhaust gas alde- hyde samples were collected using the DNPH method. These samples were analyzed gravimetrically and separated into components from formaldehyde to heptaldehyde with a gas Chromatograph. 237</page><page sequence="219">831743-831749 Results comparing the vegetable oils to Diesel fuel gen- erally show slight improvements in thermal efficiency and indicated specific energy consumption; equal or higher gas- phase emissions; lower indicated specific revertant emis- sions; and significantly higher aldehyde emissions, including an increased percentage of formaldehyde. 831744. Development of Detroit Diesel Allision 6V-92TA methanol fueled coach engine. R. R. Toepel, J. E. Bennethum, and R. E. Heruth, Detroit Diesel Allison Division, General Motors Corporation. Methanol has emerged as a near-term alternate to diesel fuel. The extremely low cetane rating of methanol has to this time precluded its use as a compression ignition fuel. Detroit Diesel Allison Division of General Motors has de- veloped a version of the Series 92 two-stroke engine that is capable of operating on neat methanol by autoignition when the engine is at normal operating temperatures. This devel- opment was made possible by controlling the scavenging process to produce the desired in-cylinder conditions at the time of fuel injection. Glow plugs are used for starting and light load operation. Development methodology and engine modifications are described and detailed performance and emission data are presented. 1983 SAE Transactions 831745. Development of a methanol fueled, turbocharged, spark assisted diesel engine and vehicle. Henry G. Adelman, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, University of Santa Clara. A Volkswagen automotive diesel engine and vehicle have been modified to use methanol fuel by the addition of a spark ignition system. The modified engine has some im- portant advantages over conventional spark ignition (SI) engines operating on alcohol fuels and diesel engines using diesel fuel. Compared to the diesel fueled vehicle, the spark assisted methanol version showed significant improvements in NOx while particulates were eliminated. Relative fuel consumption was slightly higher with methanol than with diesel fuel but could be improved by further development. Compared to a gasoline vehicle converted to operate on methanol the spark assisted diesel has higher efficiency with comparable NOx and CO emissions. Unburned fuel emis- sions are higher for the spark assisted diesel but may be reduced to comparable levels with catalyst and engine de- velopments. 831746. An improved cetane number predictor for alter- native fuels. Michael J. Murphy, Battelle, Colum- bus Laboratories. The complexity of and expense involved in determining the cetane number of diesel fuel using a standard test engine have led to the development and widespread use of the ASTM cetane index. However the cetane index was not intended for use with alternative or unusual diesel fuels; its use with such fuels can lead to large errors. Using a data- base of alternative diesel fuel properties, a new cetane num- ber prediction equation has been developed for use with alternative fuels, including alcohols. Compared with the cetane index, the average error in predicted cetane number is reduced by 40% and the number of cases where the error exceeds 5 cetane numbers is reduced by 30%. The signifi- cance of the various terms in the equation is discussed. 1983 SAE Transactions 831747. Coal-fueled diesel engines. Frank Robben, Law- rence Berkeley Laboratory, University of Califor- nia. The use of pulverized coal as a fuel for diesel engines can be a practical and efficient means of substituting coal for oil and gas in medium size applications such as railroad loco- motives, ships and industrial stationary and co-generation power. These applications could result in reducing the oil and gas consumption of the U.S. by 2% to 10%, depending on the market penetration. The extensive German develop- ment of the use of pulverized coal in diesels during the period 1930 to 1944 demonstrated that coal-fueled diesels can be a practical heat engine. Although the German devel- opment used dry pulverized coal as a fuel, it now appears that beneficiated coal-water slurries will be a more practical and economical form of fuel. Operation on coal-water slur- ries is likely to pose some problems with ignition and parti- cle agglomeration which require investigation. In this paper the background on coal-fueled diesel engines is reviewed and the potential applications and benefits are briefly pre- sented. The technical problems in developing a coal-water slurry diesel are reviewed and possibilities for overcoming these problems are presented and discussed. A coal-fueled diesel research and development program is recommended. 831748. Differences between Europe and North America which may affect lubricant qualities. Michael C. Beggs, Castrol Ltd., Swindon, England. European Engine Tests for the classification of lubricants have developed differently from the API Classification Tests. The various physical differences between Europe and North America are examined to determine if a real need exists for different tests. 831749.

In this paper characteristics of European truck diesel en- gines with regard to their lubrication are compared with those of North American diesel engines. Comparisons are given concerning the legislation, operational characteristics, characterisation of European diesel engines (engine design, performance, lubricating oil system, piston/linear assembly, valve train, bearings, supercharging) and the future trends of diesel engines for heavy trucks. 238</page><page sequence="220">831749-831754 Some major differences regarding the lubrication of European and North American diesel engines can be seen, leading to special requirements. 831750. European gasoline engine lubricant performance tests. A. Cassiani-Ingoni, Assoreni, Milano, Italy; S. Corso, Fiat Auto S.p.A., Torino, Italy; and C. von Eberan-Eberhorst, Deutsche BP AG, Ham- burg, Germany. The Coordinating European Council for the Development of Performance Tests for Lubricants and Engine Fuels (CEC) was founded 20 years ago with primary objective of developing simple and cheap standardized performance tests in European equipment in order to avoid the prolifera- tion of inhouse test procedures. This paper describes the changing emphasis on CEC terms of reference over the years and quotes examples of specific European tests which have become well established and are being used by oil and additive companies, vehicle manufacturers and users. The European engine lubricant environment is described and the interaction between the industries and standardizing bodies involved is highlighted. The CEC is endeavouring to meet the challenge of providing appropriate performance tests to the industries, requiring flexibility and close cooperation, particularly at a time when the evolution of engine designs and usage is relatively rapid. On the basis of increasing international/in- tercontinental cooperation between vehicle manufacturers and oil/additive companies a rationalized approach to com- mon test procedures should be beneficial to all parties con- cerned with the development and use of engine lubricants. 831751. European developments in diesel performance standards. Richard Steinke, Shell International Chemical Co.; Joachim Bosse, Volkswagen; Max Gairing, Daimler-Benz A.G., Chairman of CEC Surveillance Group SL 8, Chairman CEC Project Group CL 29; Heribert Nasch, Wintershall A.G., Chairman CEC Surveillance Group SL 5; and John Richardson, Mobil Oil Co. Ltd., Chairman CEC Surveillance Group SL 11. The lubricant technical community in Europe (including the U.K.) has been developing a series of performance stan- dards for lubricants resembling the API/ASTM/SAE tri- partite system, but directed towards European needs. Whilst considerable use is made of the API categories such as SE, SF, CD, etc., there are nevertheless several areas where it is felt that the U.S. specifications do not fully address European needs. Because of this the European en- gine manufacturers under the aegis of the CCMC are devel- oping a proposed set of gasoline and diesel engine test se- quences oriented towards the European needs. This paper is only concerned with those in the diesel area. Also, individual engine manufacturers have their own specifica- tions in advance of the adoption of a common European specification. 831752. Cold starting characteristics of tar sands fuels in a swirl chamber automotive diesel engine. Omer L. Giilder, John K. S. Wong, and Raymond Bill- ingham, National Research Council, Canada. A swirl chamber automotive diesel engine was tested with five different fuels in order to evaluate the cold starting performance of Tar Sands derived diesel fuels which have higher aromatic contents with wider boiling ranges and lower cetane numbers. Higher aromatic content is expected to deteriorate the cold starting performance due to in- creased ignition delay periods; on the other hand low initial boiling point improves cold starting. Cold starting trials were performed in a temperature controlled cold chamber capable of temperatures down to -38°C. Extensive data were obtained for five fuels using two types of injection nozzles. Data presented include glow plug warm-up times as a function of temperature, engine cranking speeds at various ambient temperatures at which cold start attempts were made, and minimum starting temperatures and crank- ing speeds for different glow plug heating times. 831753. Experiences with diesel fuel containing cold flow improver additives. R. D. Tharby, Gulf Canada Limited, Research &amp; Development Dept. Declining gasoline/distillate demand ratios in the Canadian petroleum product market have further aggravated the tra- ditional shortfall of low cloud point middle distillate fuels in the winter and created a need to improve refinery flexibility. The advances in performance of wax crystal modifier addi- tives have been used to formulate No. 2 Diesel fuels with good response in the Low Temperature Flow Test (LTFT). Field testing of selected flow improved diesel fuels both in controlled fleet testing an in a portion of the Canadian market, has demonstrated that such fuels provide satisfac- tory vehicle operability well below the cloud point or wax appearance point temperature. In the vehicles tested in con- trolled fleet tests, the LTFT pass temperature correlated well with minimum temperature for vehicle operability. 831754. The development of a European cold weather driveability test procedure for motor vehicles with spark ignition engines. Kurt Falk, Volvo Car Corp., Dri veline Engineering. Motor and Oil Industries in Europe continue to recognize the need to establish realistic test procedures to evaluate the driveability performance of cars and fuels. Accordingly, representatives from both industries have been working to- gether in the CF24 Group, formed in 1978 under the aus- pices of the Coordinating European Council (CEC), to de- velop standard driveability test methods. While CF24's tasks and preliminary achievements were first outlined to the SAE in 1981, this paper describes the Group's more recent field test in Sweden and chassis dynamometer work throughout Europe, which has led tho the establishment of a European cold weather driveability test procedure. 239</page><page sequence="221">831754-831759 The method provides a means of assessing engine start- ing, idling, and drive quality during the warm-up phase, and is capable of distinguishing between fuel volatility, vehicle design characteristic, and ambient air temperature effects. Acceptable test precision and road/chassis dynamometer correlation has been fully demonstrated, but it is felt that driver training is an essential feature of the method if opti- mum benefit from its use is to be obtained. As motor vehicle design trends in the USA approach those of Europe, the need for similarity between the drive- ability test procedures used on both sides of the Atlantic is becoming obvious, as is the need for forging closer links between the CRC and CEC organisations which have simi- lar goals. 831755. Car driveability modelling: a computer model for the prediction of hesitation under cold weather accelerating conditions. J. K. Pearson, P. L. Or- man, and B. D. Caddock, Shell Research Ltd. Vehicle driveability is a function of gasoline volatility, am- bient conditions and engine design. The ability to predict driveability performance from a knowledge of fuel/air mixture temperatures and gasoline properties would greatly assist both fuel and engine development. Accordingly, a model to predict engine hesitation under full-throttle ac- celerations (a major driveability malfunction) has been de- veloped. Hesitation occurs when the fuel/air mixture reaching the combustion chambers is too lean to burn. Thus the model is based on the calculation of heat flow and air/fuel vapour ratios in the engine inlet manifold. Chassis dyna- mometer tests for two different cars using a range of fuels and a range of test temperatures have shown that the model gives an accurate prediction of mixture temperatures and engine hesitation under full-throttle conditions. 831756. Driveability number - a gasoline volatility pa- rameter related to cold start passenger car per- formance. D. A. Barker and M. R. Dunn, Shell Development Co. Many passenger cars exhibit various driveability malfunc- tions during cold start operation. These engine malfunc- tions, such as stalling, hesitation, stumble, and backfire, can usually be lessened or eliminated with increased ambient temperatures and increased gasoline volatility. Based upon laboratory performance testing of 99 cars, we have devel- oped a Driveability Number (DNT), which is a gasoline quality parameter that can be used to predict the driveabil- ity performance of a fleet of cars. DNT is calculated from a model which is a function of ambient temperature and gaso- line volatility. The gasoline volatility parameters used in this model are the 10%, 50%, and 90% evaporation points. The model was developed using late-model (1976-1982) cars, which were tested under controlled environmental conditions on a chassis dynamometer. 831757. Soot and valve train wear in passenger car diesel engines. Isamu Nagai and Hiroyasu Endo, Mitsubishi Motors Corp.; and Hideo Nakamura and Hisashi Yano, Mitsubishi Oil Co., Ltd. The effect of the use of the EGR system on the lubrication of a passenger car diesel engine was investigated. The higher the EGR rate, the more soot in the oil. And the most detrimental effect was found in valve train wear. Some en- gine tests, including motoring tests, were carried out to investigate the contribution of soot to valve train wear. The mechanism of cam and rocker arm wear in used oils was studied by analyzing for elements on the lubricated metal surface and subsequently the mechanism was more thor- oughly studied using the four-ball test. Soot seems to act as an abrasive on the anti-wear solid film formed by the oil on the metal surface and this film contains Ca, O, P and S. Some hardware modifications and oil formulations to re- duce valve train wear are also discussed. 1 983 SAE Transactions 831758. A field test study of camshaft wear in a 2.3L OHC engine and its correlation to the sequence V-D test. S. W. Harris and T. L. Zahalka, Amoco Chemicals Corp. A field test was conducted to evaluate the valve train wear performance of new technology crankcase lubricants in 1980 vehicles powered by 2.3L overhead camshaft engines. Three SF/CD 15W-40 oils and two low phosphorus SF/CC 10W-30 passenger car oils were evaluated in commuter service with extended oil drain intervals for 48,000 to 80,000 km. Interim wear measurements of the camshaft lobes and camshaft followers were performed throughout the test. All five of the new technology lubricants tested dem- onstrated good control of valve train wear in this service. These oils also passed the V-D test, thus, the test supports the use of SF wear limits in the V-D test for defining pas- senger oil quality levels. Wear profiles indicate that cam- shaft wear rates were significantly higher during break-in and were not particularly sensitive to oil chemistry during break-in. Oils formulated with secondary alkyl zinc dithio- phosphate (Zn DTP) wear inhibitors provided significantly better wear protection than two different primary alkyl Zn DTPs. A secondary alkyl Zn DTP demonstrated good wear protection at phosphorus contents as low as 0.07 per cent (w). 831759. Effects of engine oil additives and carbon parti- cles on valve train wear of diesel engines. Tornio Yoshihara and Tetsuo Wakizono, Showa Oil Co., Ltd. (Japan); and Hiromichi Hara and Eiichi Na- kagawa, Isuzu Motors Limited (Japan). This paper deals with the effect of engine oil additives, carbon particles and rocker arm materials on the valve train wear of diesel engines. 240</page><page sequence="222">831759-831779 The tests were performed with an ISUZU 1.8L OHC type diesel engine powered by the motored engine method. The sixteen experimental oil formulations were based on the orthogonal method of experimental design. The results were obtained as follows, (1) It was confirmed there were main effects and inter- actions between each additive component for the valve train wear with a statistical analysis. (2) The failure phenomena and anti-wear properties of the valve train were affected by the additive components, rocker arm materials and carbon particles. The type of zinc dithiophosphate was a very important factor in the valve train wear. 831760. Effect of engine oil zinc dithiophosphate (ZDP) additive type on cam and lifter wear in taxi serv- ice. Donald J. Smoleński and Richard H. Kabel, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Re- search Laboratories. The major phosphorus-containing compounds in engine oil are zinc dithiophosphates (ZDP's), which act both as antio- xidants and antiwear agents. To reduce engine oil phospho- rus concentrations without compromising engine durability, and thereby reduce phosphorus poisoning of emission con- trol devices, an optimum ZDP or ZDP mixture should be used. A 160 000-km taxi test was conducted to determine the relative camshaft and lifter wear protection provided by several ZDP's and ZDP mixtures. Wear protection was poorest with aryl ZDP's (which are thermally stable, as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)), in- termediate with long-chain primary alkyl ZDP's (which are thermally unstable), and best with short-chain primary al- kyl ZDP's (which are of intermediate thermal stability). Sequence HID test results on analogs of the field test oils correlated fairly well with taxi test results; Sequence V-D test results did not correlate as well. 831761. The determination of additive effects in a Japa- nese valve train wear test using an orthogonal statistical design. Magane Matsuoka, Takeji Ari- fuku, Masaaki Aoki, and Richard C. Coy, Shell Kosan Kabushiki Kaisha. The factors affecting valve train wear such as individual additives, additive interactions and engine variability have been investigated using an orthogonal type of statistical experimental design. 27 oils formulated on the basis of a 5-factor [Zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate (ZnDTP), disper- sant, detergent, Viscosity Index (VI) improver and engine], 3-level (3 types of each additive) array were used to assess the significance of each factor and possible interactions be- tween ZnDTP and other additives on cam and rocker arm wear in the Toyota 20R test. ZnDTPs had the most signifi- cant effect followed by dispersant, detergent and VI im- prover. Additive interactions were also detected and hence using this experimental design novel additive combinations giving good performance can be identified and used by the lubricant formulator. 831775. Fully integrated Truck Information And Control Systems (TI ACS). Trevor O. Jones, TRW Transportation Electrical &amp; Electronics Opera- tions, Solon, OH; and Wallace K. Tsuha, Trans- portation Electronics Division, TRW Inc., Farm- ington Hills, MI. Electronic sub-systems are being developed for heavy duty trucks. However, these sub-systems are being developed as individual entities i.e., information, monitoring, recording, control systems etc. This paper identifies the current, near term, and long range system requirements and suggests ideas for a fully integrated Truck Information And Control System (TIACS) aimed at an orderly approach to a vehicle electronic system for heavy duty trucks. 831776. Automated mechanical transmission controls. R. C. Holmes, R. R. Smyth, and D. Speranza, Eaton Corp. An automatic transmission for Class 7 and 8 trucks is presently under development. This system involves the mar- riage of current products with advanced electronic technol- ogy. The system considerations and design philosophies of the electronic controller are described, as well as the me- chanical hardware for conversion of a manual transmission into a fully automatic transmission. Actual vehicle test results, including shift performance, illuminate the benefits to be derived from an automated mechanical transmission. 831777. Electronic truck instrument panel displays. Jo- seph Gormley, James I. Berry, Gerald J. DeSan- tis, and Jeffrey L. Wainwright, Ford Motor Com- pany. Integrating microcomputer-based components and high technology displays to the heavy-duty truck instrument panel is an evolutionary step in panel development. The application and technology, based on automotive experi- ence, is proven and the initially higher cost of more so- phisticated instrumentation will be offset by capabilities offering a return on investment not possible even with the most modern electromechanical instrumentation. 831779. Austrian airfield buses for the Los Angeles Inter- national Airport. G. Bruner and J. Low, ÖAF-Gräf &amp; Stift AG, Vienna, Austria. International terminal facilities at Los Angeles Interna- tional Airport have been inundated by a rising tide of air travellers which grew by 100 percent during the past five years. Expansion programs have started easing congestion and delays. To further lessen congestion around the interna- tional satellite, six aircraft parking pads were added in 1981 to accommodate arriving aircraft when gate positions are 241</page><page sequence="223">831779-831788 not available. Several newly acquired high capacity airfield buses shuttle passengers over a distance of approximately two miles between the remote parking pads and the termi- nal. 831780. A new breed of engine brake for the Cummins LIO engine. R. B. Price and Z. S. Meistrick, Ja- cobs Mfg. Co. A new compression engine brake has been developed for the Cummins LIO engine. High retarding power was required in order to compensate for the loss of natural retarding ability of modern heavy duty trucks resulting from fuel- saving devices. A computer model was used to select the most feasible design. The new concept utilizes one exhaust valve per cylinder with a valve reset mechanism. Prototype hardware was laboratory and field tested. Correlation be- tween the test results and computer simulation is exhibited. A relationship between the Model 404 performance and the vehicle retarding capability is shown. This new engine brake model is one of the most efficient in terms of B.M.E.P. that Jacobs has developed. 1 983 SAE Transactions 831782. UPS multifuel stratified charge engine develop- ment - progress report. J. M. Lewis and T. K. McBride, United Parcel Service - Automotive Engineering. Initial development of the United Parcel Service stratified charge engine (UPS 292 SC) began in 1978, and by the fall of 1980 the first full track test of the engine was completed with an installation in a UPS delivery van. The engine now is in production for the purpose of a 500-vehicle, nationwide test of the engine under actual package delivery operating conditions. Vehicles powered by the UPS 292 SC will be based for test purposes in locations offering varied conditions of temperature and terrain to determine whether any defects in design or components remain to be corrected. At present some 125 of the engines are being run in UPS operations, and some 175 of the engines are in transit or awaiting installation around the country. An engine development program is an unusual venture for a transportation company that lacks experienced per- sonnel or facilities for such a project. This report will note, particularly, the exceptional cooperation of American auto- motive component suppliers, without whose contributions this work could not have been completed. This report will trace the genesis of the engine and focus in detail on the engineering problems encountered and the solutions that evolved. In addition to engineering detail, a cursory assessment of the engine in the context of national petroleum supplies will be offered as well as some insights into potential im- provements that may add to the value of this promising development. 1983 SAE Transactions 831783. Executive summary SAE/DOT truck and bus fuel economy measurement program. Rodger F. Ringham, 1976 SAE President, Dallas, TX. A program summary covering the SAE/DOT Truck and Bus Fuel Economy Measurement Program from 1975 through 1982. Emphasized are the very outstanding volun- tary participation by users, suppliers and vehicle manufac- turers throughout the program, which culminated in work- ability and meaningful fuel economy measurement procedures. 831784. Development of fuel economy test procedures. Richard S. Johnson, International Harvester Co. This paper is a condensation of SAE Special Publication 561 which reports the "Development and Validation of the Joint TMC/SAE Fuel Consumption Test Procedure Type II - SAE J1321, October 1981, by a Joint Task Force" and the related "Truck Test Program" run at the Transporta- tion Research Center of Ohio in the summer of 1980. A large part of the process of condensing the complete publi- cation consisted of omitting entire sections or reducing them to a few sentences. Some new information has been added. 1983 SAE Transactions 831785. SAE/DOT in-service validation test program. Claude J. Travis, Jr., Consultant Fleet Manager. Fuel efficient components and concepts when incorporated into heavy duty trucking design have been known to im- prove mpg performance. There has been, however, an ina- bility within the engineering community to universally measure these values. The computer instrumentation of four Class VI straight trucks and four Class VIII tractor/semi-trailers supplied by industry, the operation of these vehicles by the SAE/DOT in revenue service within volunteer fleets for a year and a half, and additional OEM testing, has completed the validation of test procedures for heavy duty vehicle fuel economy measurement. This testing has also resulted in the accumulation of a large amount of data relating to truck operation all of which can be assessed through the DOT VEHSIM computer prediction program. 831788. Directional control of retarder-equipped heavy trucks operating on slippery surfaces. P. S. Fancher, Transportation Research Institute, The University of Michigan; and R. W. Radliński, Vehicle Research and Test Center, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Data from driver-controlled vehicle tests are presented to demonstrate the nature of the control difficulties that may result from the use of retarders when the road surface is slippery. Findings from a computer simulation suitable for detailed study of the directional dynamics of retarder- equipped vehicles are described. A simplified analytical me- thod is provided for estimating the influences of lateral acceleration (turning radius at speed), retarder torque, 242</page><page sequence="224">831788-831810 tire/road friction, and vehicle loading on the bounds of con- trollable vehicle operation. 1983 SAE Transactions 831789. Exhaust brakes for Japanese trucks. Masahiko Kuwano, Kazunori Endoh, and Isao Suzuki, Ji- dosha Kiki Co., Ltd. The retarders which are broadly used in Japan at the pre- sent time are exhaust brakes of exhaust pipe open/close type. The history of employment of these retarders, which are now adopted not only in heavy trucks but also in me- dium and light trucks, is explained in this paper. The while, observing the process of improvement of components and of the control system as well as the braking effects of exhaust brakes, the reasons for such a growth are examined. As a recent technical trend the purpose of use of ex- haust pipe open/close valves are diversified to acceleration of engine warmup besides retarding effects to the vehicle. And it is also necessary today to correspond to engines with turbochargers. Therefore, high temperature resistance, improvement of working durability and so forth can be raised as technical subjects to be solved in the future, and these subjects are explained in this paper. 831790. Acquisition of transient tire force and moment data for dynamic vehicle handling simulations. Amnon Sitchin, Ford Motor Company. This paper describes the issues encountered in using con- ventionally acquired tire test data for dynamic total vehicle handling simulations and the need for improved methodol- ogy. It describes the new test procedure that was used to acquire all three forces and three moments in a transient mode for a matrix of loads, slip and camber angles. A study of the test data supports the premises that the overturning moment, Mx, should not be neglected in dynamic simula- tions, and that the effects of camber should not be treated as only an independent, linearly additive, camber thrust. Instead of the conventional application of a bi-cubic regression fit to a six region data division, a new algorithm is applied. The data is divided differently into five regions in the a - Fz plane, and a variable format regression equation is applied as appropriate. The resulting regression coeffi- cients matrix is readily usable in dynamic simulations, and is shown to have a superior curve fit to the test data. 1983 SAE Transactions 831796. Prediction of contained air temperature from SAE standard rolling resistance test data. Tho- mas M. Kenny, Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Prod- uct Development. Truck tire rolling resistance, when determined through the SAE J 1379 test matrix, can be shown to predict cavity air temperature at test equilibrium. Cavity temperatures are determined with the SAE Standard test data, heat transfer relationships, and equations of state. When this method is compared to road test data, the SAE J 1379 test procedure is shown to be more precise, equally accurate, and many times faster to perform than the same test conducted on the road. 831798. Fuel economy advantage of 2-speed axles. L. T. Chapman, Eaton Corp. - Axle Div. The purpose of this paper is to describe comparative fuel economy testing of two-speed and single speed truck axles and to present data showing the fuel-saving capability of a two-speed versus a single speed axle. Fuel economy test results of a medium duty truck equipped first with a man- ual transmission and then with an automatic transmission, and both in combination with single speed and two-speed axles, is provided at varying gross vehicle weights. The two-speed axle with ratios straddling the ratio of the single speed provided substantial fuel savings when used as a transmission range extender at highway speeds. 831799. Study of models for the prediction of average road load of in-use delivery trucks. Soyoung Cha and Roberta L. Sloan, Northrop Services, Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC; and Frank M. Black, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC. Coast-down studies of Class 6 trucks were conducted at near-zero road grade and wind conditions. Speed-versus- time data were recorded, smoothed to a quadratic equation to calculate deceleration rates, and reduced by the least- square method using two-, three-, and five-parameter linear models. The estimated parameters were analyzed statisti- cally and compared to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommended procedure. The averages of the individual truck road loads for the three models were consistent within 4% when reference conditions of 40 mi/h, 15,000 lb weight, and 65 ft2 proj- ected frontal area were used. These reference conditions represent the median values of experiment conditions that were varied during coast-down tests. At these conditions, road load variations among the trucks averaged 10% and 16% for the two- and five-parameter models, respectively. The coefficients of the five-parameter model displayed in- stability during sequential estimation, showing multicol- linearity. Because of this instability and the significance of the truck-to-truck variations, the two-parameter model seemed most appropriate for predicting the truck road load. At reference conditions, the two-parameter model road load was 10% greater than that from the EPA recommended procedure. 1983 SAE Transactions 831810. (P-136) The corrosion behavior of galvanized and cold rolled steels. J. V. Standish, G. W. Whelan, and T. R. Roberts, Armco Research Center. 243</page><page sequence="225">831810-831816 Samples of painted cold rolled and galvanized steel have been exposed to laboratory cyclic and salt spray tests, accel- erated outdoor exposure in Florida, and on a vehicle in De- troit. Samples have been evaluated visually and by scanning electron microscopy and microprobe analysis. Galvanized steel performed better than cold rolled steel in all but the salt spray test. Some of the factors influencing the spread of corrosion beneath a paint film have been iden- tified. 831811. (P-136) Cleanability of drawing compounds. R. D. Wyvill and H. R. Charles, Chemfil Corp., Troy, MI. Mill oils, drawing compounds and rust preventatives should be qualified for subsequent automotive assembly plant cleanability before being used in the steel mills and fabrica- tion plants. Soils which later prove difficult to remove can lead to patterning problems in phosphate, electropaint and even topcoat. Resultant sanding operations then lead to a loss of corrosion protection and early field failure. This paper deals with the reasons why cleanability studies are becoming more important and discusses the automotive qualification programs which have been imple- mented over the last year. 831812. (P-136) Laboratory evaluation of automotive con- version coatings. Gary D. Kent, Kenneth J. Ha- cías, and Nicephoros A. Fotinos, Parker Surface Treatment Products, Occidental Chemical Corp. Currently many laboratory cycle tests are being used to evaluate the actual corrosion on automobile bodies. Our objective was to study the major laboratory test procedures being used to determine which, if any, of them is best in correlating to actual corrosion performance observed in automobiles. 831813. (P-136) High film build cathodic electrodepo- sition provides improved corrosion protection. Frederick M. Loop, PPG Industries. Cathodic electrodeposition has become the dominant me- thod of priming cars and trucks throughout the world. This achievement is a result of the superior corrosion resistance of cathodic paint technology and inherent advantages of the electrodeposition process. High film build cathodic electrodeposition of 30 to 35 microns provides a significant improvement in corrosion resistance. This new technology produces increased film build, greater chip resistance, and better corrosion resist- ance as indicated by salt fog, scab, test track, and other corrosion tests. This paint uses the electrodeposition proc- ess to apply the majority or all of the primer requirements; it provides economic efficient paint utilization, process sim- plification, and high quality to meet the goals of the auto- motive industry. As a single primer coating or as a base for a primer surfacer, it provides good film smoothness and metal filling properties. More than 20 electrodeposition tanks are filled with this quality product to coat car of truck bodies and other parts. The application characteristics are related to conven- tional cathodic electrodeposition, but the deposited film is notably altered to achieve these improvements. 831814. (P-136) A three-chamber corrosion test method for passenger cars. Roland Dietz, Audi NSU Auto Union AG, Federal Republic of Germany. The resistance of passenger cars to corrosion is tested in a three-chamber system, in which the cars are subjected to extreme climatic conditions. A hydropulse installation, a roller dynamometer, blower fans and a 'gravel gun' firing stone chippings are used to simulate actual road use. During a 14- week test period, it is possible to obtain corrosion equivalent to that which would have occurred in 6 years of driving in a very corrosive environment. 1983 SAE Transactions 831815. (P-136) The salt spray test - past, present, and future. Thomas S. Doppke, GM Truck and Bus Engineering; and Arthur W. Bryant, Ford Motor Co. The salt spray test has been an industry wide standard corrision test since its conception in 1914. A literary review of its history shows that it has always been thought of as inconsistent and unreliable but, for a variety of reasons, has continued to be used. A study of more than 55 salt spray cabinets was per- formed using a controlled lot of parts and questionnaires on cabinet operation. Although the tested parts varied from mildly corroded to extremely rusted no factor could be found to account for the differences. Although the test has its uses it should be studied by an industry formed committee which should make recom- mendations as to further standardization and corrections to the test. A lengthy chronological bibliography aids the reader in further study and reference. 1983 SAE Transactions 831816. (P-136) The corrosion performance of steel self- piercing rivets when used with aluminum compo- nents. R. M. Howard and S. P. Sunday, Reynolds Metals Co. One joining technique that is receiving increased attention is mechanical fastening with a steel self-piercing rivet. The use of steel rivets in direct contact with aluminum compo- nents raises questions concerning galvanic corrosion. To determine if a corrosion problem exists, aluminum samples were joined by two processes - resistance spot welding and steel self-piercing rivets. 244</page><page sequence="226">831816-831821 Replicate samples using two aluminum alloys were tested for 90 days by alternate immersion in 3.5% NaCl water solution.

Hart, Homer Research Laboratories, Bethle- hem Steel Corp.; and H. E. Townsend, Homer Laboratories, Bethlehem Steel Corp. Electrodeposited Zn-Ni alloy coatings show a maximum resistance to salt spray corrosion at 12% to 15% Ni. To gain an increased understanding of this behavior, we stud- ied the corrosion mechanisms of 13% Ni coatings in so- dium chloride solutions with electrochemical, microscopic, x-ray, and Auger electron spectroscopic methods. We ob- served that the Zn-Ni alloy initially corrodes with the pref- erential dissolution of zinc. As the coating dezincifies, ten- sile stresses are created in the coating causing development of a fine network of cracks. As corrosion progresses, the coating transforms into a composite barrier layer consisting of a microcracked nickel-rich metallic phase and zinc corro- sion products. This behavior contrasts with that of pure zinc coatings which corrode by a simple mechanism of uni- form dissolution. The superiority of Zn-Ni alloy coatings in salt spray corrosion appears to result from slower anodic dissolution kinetics and some barrier protection afforded by the remaining composite layer. 1983 SAE Transactions 831818. (P-136) Mechanism of cathodic electrocoat primer cratering. R. G. Hart and H. E. Town- send, Research Dept., Bethlehem Steel Corp., Bethlehem, PA. Cathodic electrocoat primers (cathodic e-coat) have been widely adopted by the automobile industry. One drawback to these coatings is that they display a tendency for forma- tion of crater-like features when applied to zinc-rich sur- faces under typical automotive application conditions. Our studies show that cratering susceptibility is an inherent property of zinc and that the craters result from localized dielectric breakdown of the e-coat film during deposition. Energy from the electric discharges displaces the e-coat at the discharge sites and locally cures the adja- cent e-coat. During cure-baking, the locally cured e-coat does not re-flow to fill the voids created by the discharges, resulting in crater-like features in the cured e-coat film. 1983 SAE Transactions 831819. (P-136) Paintability performance of metallic coated steels. Lawrence L. Franks and Edward T. Nowak, Inland Steel Research Laboratories. Eleven coated steel substrates and cold-rolled steel were painted with three automotive paint systems and subjected to three different atmospheric corrosion environments and two different on-vehicle corrosion environments. Exposures were designed to give results indicative of the cosmetic corrosion behavior of these materials when used in exposed automotive body panel applications. Results clearly show that of the twelve materials tested, zinc-base coated steels performed best in all environments studied. A correlation is evident between heavier zinc coatings and longer term cosmetic corrosion resistance. Galvannealed steels offer ap- proximately equivalent cosmetic corrosion resistane at equal coating weights when compared to galvanized steels. Cold-rolled steel does not offer long-term cosmetic corro- sion resistance for automotive applications. In addition, a zinc-rich primed exposed surface does not offer a substan- tial increase in cosmetic corrosion protection in comparison to cold-rolled steel. Results of these exposures were also compared to the results of various accelerated corrosion tests to attempt to establish a correlation between long-term exposures and accelerated methods for evaluation of cos- metic corrosion performance. 831820. (P-136) Proving ground vehicle corrosion testing. W. A. Schumacher, General Motors Corp. The facilities used by domestic automotive manufacturers to provide accelerated corrosion aging of complete vehicles are described in general. The types of vehicles tested, gen- eral test methodology, and techniques used to determine test-to-field correlation are discussed. The different proce- dures used throughout the industry produce different re- sults on various vehicle coatings, components, and systems. The key to successful interpretation of test results is a thor- ough understanding of the corrosion mechanisms involved and the limitations of the test and its effects on these mech- anisms. 831821. (P-136) A one thousand car assessment of the U.S. car population cooling systems. N. R. Coop- er, H. J. Hannigan, and J. C. McCourt, Union Carbide Corp., Home &amp; Automotive Products Div. For the first time a statistically valid survey and sampling of the engine coolant has been taken of the United States passenger car population covering model years 1980 through 1968 and older. The purpose of the survey was to assess the coolant inhibitor condition, glycol concentration, coolant level, and performance history in passenger cars as they prevail in all parts of the United States. A circulated warm coolant sample was taken from 1004 engine cooling systems. The samples were evaluated for rust and/or sediment, and analyzed for pH, reserve alkalinity, percent glycol, and iron concentration. The car operator was interviewed for a history of coolant mainte- nance and engine cooling performance problems. 245</page><page sequence="227">831821 -831828 The information from this unique survey clearly indi- cates the current quality of engine coolant condition and how it relates to the major geographic segments of the coun- try. Cars requiring service are shown, based on coolant con- dition parameters such as rust, sediment, glycol concentra- tions, loss of reserve alkalinity, and low coolant level. Despite the essential role of the coolant as a full time functional fluid, essential for corrosion protection and criti- cal heat transfer, the survey data shows a high percentage of coolant neglect and apparent ignoring of service recommen- dations of car manufacturers, antifreeze marketers, and other automotive authorities. 831822. (P-136) Corrosion investigation of auto surfaces and professional washing of auto paint surfaces. Carl Wiseman, University of Texas; and Bruce Milen, International Car Wash Association. This project was initiated to determine the effect of regular car washings upon the retardation of corrosion on automo- biles. A periodic problem is present in northern climates where, during the winter months, roads are often laden with salt to prevent icing of the streets. Some of the salt will become deposited on the car with accompanying possible corrosion problems. Furthermore, when the vehicle is taken to a commercial car wash establishment, the salt will be- come incorporated in the recycled water to be used in wash- ing of other cars. Whether this chloride content build-up in reclaim water in northern car washes is significant needs to be determined. Thus, there are two sources where corrosion is a potential problem. 831823. (P-136) Automotive car care products. George F. Felton, Jr., Ashland Oil, Inc. This paper covers formulating and testing of automotive car polishes. The automobile continues to be one of the first loves of America. Automobiles are being kept longer than any pe- riod since World War II, and the average age of the U.S. auto fleet is 7.4 years. Because of this, maintaining a good appearance is still a high priority for car owners. Although car waxes are primarily used to make the car look better, they do provide some protection against UV, abrasion, and oxidation if applied regularly. It should be remembered, however, that the polish is buffed down to an extremely thin film measured in microns. This means there is not really very much deposited when a car has been polished; however, something is deposited which can provide protec- tion, especially if a durable car polish, high gloss type pol- ish, is used. 831824. (P-136) After market protection of vinyl, paint, and fabric finishes. David C. Vegh and Roosevelt White, Ziebart International Corporation. This presentation discusses the effectiveness of aftermarket paint, vinyl, and fabric protection services as they relate to the appearance and maintenance of the vehicle from the customer's perception. For paint protection, luster, depth of gloss, durability etc., will be measured by various acceler- ated laboratory tests. For vinyl protection, both laboratory tests and outdoor exposure will be used to show that preser- vation of the vinyl is possible. Finally, for fabric protection, anti-soiling, flammability and wear tests among others will be used to show that fabric life and appearance can be extended. 831825. (P-136) After market rustproofing in fleet opera- tions. William G. Daly, Jr., Maine Dept. of Transportation, Motor Transport Service. Should you utilize after-market rust-proofing on your fleet equipment? This question is one of the many that must be answered by Fleet Managers when they purchase new equipment. The purpose of this paper is to discuss some of the key points to be considered in answering that question, and how to set up an effective rustproofing program. 831827. (P-136) Corrosion and safety. Paul C. Marriner, Road Safety Directorate, Transport Canada. While corrosion in general is a subject of considerable inter- est to automotive engineers, corrosion related failures of components which may affect safe vehicle operation often generate intense investigation due to their ramifications. Manufacturers take considerable precautions to avoid these situations and so their occurrence is usually the result of an unexpectedly severe environment or an unfamiliar corrosive mechanism. The failure of suspension and brake system components, fasteners and seals is discussed with emphasis on the corrosion mechanisms and service environ- ments. A wider dissemination of this information may per- mit design engineers to avoid these problems in the future. 831828. (P-136) Corrosion of metals and the effectiveness of inhibitors in ethanol fuels. Monte S. Walker and Robert L. Chance, Physical Chemistry Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. The purpose of this study was to determine the corrosivity of hydrated ethanol fuel, and to determine the effectiveness of soluble corrosion inhibitors in preventing this corrosion. Electrochemical techniques and laboratory immersion tests were used to measure the corrosion rate of certain fuel system metals in ethanol contaminated with water and other impurities. On the basis of chemical analysis of com- mercial fuels and corrosion rate measurements, a corrosive fuel mixture was formulated that was used to test the effec- tiveness of commercial inhibitors. Based on our tests, it would seem that inhibitors provide a reasonable method for preventing corrosion when hydrated ethanol fuel is used. 1983 SAE Transactions 246</page><page sequence="228">831829 - 831836 831829. (P-136) Dezincification corrosion and its preven- tion for copper/brass radiators. Kwang H. Park, Ford Motor Co. The use of a corrosion inhibited arsenical brass alloy for copper/brass radiator tubes has been identified as an effec- tive means to protect the radiator tubes from external de- zincification attack, which is generally caused by an expo- sure to excessive road salts in the regions such as Montreal and Toronto in Canada. Laboratory test methods, their results and field data verifying improved radiator life are presented. 1983 SAE Transactions 831830. (P-136) Corrosion failures in semiconductor devices and electronic systems. J. P. Cook and G. E. Servais, Delco Electronics, General Motors Corp. The automotive environment with its wide range of temper- atures and corrosive liquids and gases provides a harsh environment for electronic systems. The situation is further compounded by the fact that these systems are composed of a wide variety of dissimilar materials. It should be no sur- prise, therefore, that corrosion can be a significant problem in electronic systems. This paper will discuss corrosion problems related to the following: open circuits in connector contacts, leakage and shorts on printed circuit boards, metal migration prob- lems, and corrosion problems in plastic encapsulated semi- conductor devices. In many of these corrosion situations, the initial mech- anism involved in the corrosion process will often cause an electronic system to malfunction. It is, therefore, of utmost importance that these corrosion mechanisms be carefully evaluated during the development of electronic systems so that necessary steps can be taken to prevent their occur- rence. 1983 SAE Transactions 831831. (P-136) Material selection and corrosion protec- tion for bi-metallic systems in automotive envi- ronments. R. P. Schlitt and R. K. Eschebach, Chevrolet Engineering, General Motors Corp. This paper addresses the use of aluminum and magnesium as light weight materials for automobile suspension and engine applications. It will review the methods of approach in protecting these components from automotive environ- ments and some of the coatings used to insulate bi-metallic couples. Most of the results that follow have been supported by extensive testing in accelerated environments designed to simulate worst case automotive field exposure. The test parameters will be discussed and several A-B comparisons shown. 831832. (P-136) Automobile corrosion in Britain. Donald Stewart, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland. A review of the corrosion in Britain of automobiles of vari- ous countries or origin, with illustrative examples of fail- ures. The legal rights of the owner are outlined, and the significance of warranties from manufacturers and from rustproofers is discussed. Conclusions are that the con- sumer has been poorly served over the last thirty years both by the manufacturers and by the Government regulations. 831834. (P-136) Chemical conversion coatings. James W. Davis, Amchem Products, Inc., Ambler, PA. Chemical conversion coatings represent those coatings formed by contacting a metallic substrate with a "chemi- cal" solution that "converts" or "changes" the metallic surface from its original composition. The "conversion" process may arise via chemical or electrochemical interac- tion at the metallic surface, and produces a "coating" that is an integral part of the metal substrate. The presence of this "conversion coating" provides an increase in the corro- sion resistance of the metal substrate, both with and with- out a subsequently applied organic film, and an increase in the adhesive capability of the metal substrate toward fur- ther organic film applications. Typical conversón coatings that are widely used in industry are phosphates (zinc, iron, manganese, calcium-zinc), chromâtes, chrome-free coat- ings, oxides (chemically or electro-chemically formed); where each coating type provides the necessary properties that meet a particular requirement of industry. 831835. (P-136) Causes and effects of corrosion relating to exterior trim on automobiles. Robert Baboian, Texas Instruments, Inc., Attleboro, MA. The corrosivity of the automotive environment has become more severe in recent years due to increased use of road salts and acid precipitation. Corrosion problems associated with exterior automotive trim include, 1) effect of the trim on the auto-body steel and, 2) corrosion of the trim material itself. In addition to the corrosivity of the automotive envi- ronment, factors which cause these problems for a given material include the inherent crevice geometry, attachment requirements and susceptibility to paint damage in this area. Corrosion performance of an exterior trim depends heavily on the material choice. 831836. (P-136) Advancements in phosphate and oil coat- ings. Noel A. Smith, Saran Protective Coatings Co.

(P-136) Corrosion performance of Zn-Ni alloy plated sheet steel in automotive body panels. Tatsuo Kurimoto, Yoshihiko Hoboh, Hiroshi Oi- shi, and Kinya Yanagawa, Sumitomo Metal In- dustries, Ltd., Wakayama Steel Works; and Ryoi- chi Noumi, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd., Head Office. The corrosion resistance of Zn-Ni alloy electropolated sheet steel (SZ) against perforation and cosmetic corrosion was investigated in cyclic corrosion tests and service corrosion environment. Perforation resistance was evaluated in two cyclic cor- rosion tests using unpainted and 5 /xm electrocoated panels without scribe. SZ 20 g/m2 showed equivalent or superior corrosion resistance to that of Galvannealed sheet steel(GA) 60 g/m2. This excellent protection ability of SZ was validated by the field performance in OKINAWA. Cosmetic corrosion resistance of fully painted panels with scribe were estimated in Modified Volvo Scab Test. SZ and the other precoated steels had distinctive corrosion performance in comparison with cold rolled steel(CR). This result correlated well with that of monitor cars in OKI- NAWA and WAKAYAMA. 831838. (P-136) NITROTEC™ surface treatment - its development and application in the design and manufacture of automobile components. C. Dawes and D. F. Tranter, Lucas Electrical Ltd. Following a brief review of the properties and application characteristics of gaseous nitrocarburising techniques devel- oped over the last decade, specific attention is given to the Nitrotec method introduced recently to increase the corro- sion resistance and improve the aesthetics of treated compo- nents. Guidance on implementation of the new process is accompanied by examples of its exploitation in the design and manufacture of non-alloy steel automobile components. 248</page></plain_text>
