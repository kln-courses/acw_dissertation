<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Child's Conception of the World. By JEAN PIAGET. With eleven collaborators. Translated by Joan and Andrew Tomlinson. New York, Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1929. Pp. ix, 397. This is the third of the author's four studies in child logic to appear in the International Library in translation. Appointed director of the Institut J. J. Rousseau in 1921, Piaget has issued in rapid succession, in collaboration with fellow-workers, Le langage et la pensee chez l'enfant (1923), Le jugement et le raisonment chez l'enfant (1924), La representation du monde chez l'enfant (1926), and La causalite physique chez l'enfant (1927); the fourth and last reviewed in a recent number of this journal, but as yet inaccessible in translation. The series as a whole represents a systematic attack upon the problems of child thought, along a wide front. A notable contribution to the psychology of the years 4-12, it contains matter which no psychologist or sociologist can afford to overlook. The present volume limits itself to an examination of the content and texture (rather than the logical mechanism) of experience, interest centering upon the degree of objectivity achieved by the external order at different levels of development. By a series of well-directed but informal queries, constituting in fact a new experimental method, childish notions as to the nature and origin of the sun, moon, and stars, clouds, lakes and mountains, night, dreams, names, etc., are skilfully exposed, with a minimum of tampering and damage to their original structure. The unique and sui generis character of the child's apprehension (foreshadowed in the work of Stern and Binet, and</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 155 in the egocentric traits of childish logic disclosed in earlier studies by the author) is clearly patent in the protocols, many of which are quoted in detail, in all their native quaintness and incoherence of phrasing. Starting with the naive realism or adualism of Mach and Baldwin-hall-marked by its confusion of subject and object-childish experience is shown to pass through various stages of animistic and artificialist interpretation, as forecast in the rough by James and Sully. Only gradually, with the socializing of thought, does there emerge the adult notion of an impersonal, mechanically determined order; subject to frequent lapses to purposive or finalistic levels. In the general profile of childhood thus projected there is little that is wholly novel; little, in fact, that has not been common currency of instruction for a quarter-century. Piaget's distinctive merit lies in corroborating on an extensive scale the brilliant guesses of earlier observers-Sully, James, Hall, Binet-by a methodology of his own. Because of the natural solipsism of the child and lack of incentive to communication, the 'free observation' of the earlier studies is judged inadequate to the work at hand. It is therefore abandoned (except as the starting-point of inquiry) in favor of a type of informal but directed questioning, an adapted 'clinical examination' method. Rules and safeguards are painstakingly developed, and the advantages of the new pro- cedure over the more limited and falsifying routine of tests and questionnaires convincingly presented. Five types of response are carefully distinguished: the answer at random, romancing, and suggested, liberated and spontaneous conviction. Uniformity of response on certain age-levels, independent of environment, and systematiza- tion, or stability as gauged by later approach from a different angle, are em- ployed as criteria of reliability. Though the data utilized are drawn from a larger number of children than in some of the earlier studies, the treatment of results is qualitative and interpretative rather than statistical, as is fitting in a pioneer investigation. The author's insight and originality are displayed especially in those sections in which he assimilates his findings to those of workers in related fields; massing his materials so as to reveal the natural stages of progression. The discussion of data is organized under three heads-Realism, Animism and Artificialism. Sections which will perhaps best repay cursory reading are Ch. II, on Nominal Realism-a caption borrowed from Rougier, to signify the confusion of the name with the essence of the object; Ch. III, on Dreams, re- vealing a childish belief in the purposiveness of the dream; Ch. IV, The Origin of the Idea of Participation, marshalling instances of child magic which dis- play analogies with the primitive attitude posited by L6vy Bruhl; Chs. IX and X on Metereology and the Origin of Trees, etc., in which resemblances to the primitive physics of the Pre-Socratics is traced; and Ch. XI on Artificialism. Though bent on rendering an unbiased account of the child mind, in terms strictly of itself, Piaget is not indifferent to parallels in related disciplines, en- riching his discussion with analogies derived from psychiatry, semantics, anthropology, and in turn providing suggestive matter for workers in these fields. Holding that both Ribot and Freud offer too artificial and mechanical an account of animism (the endowing of external objects with activity and will),</page><page sequence="3">156 BOOK REVIEWS he himself provides a simpler solution. The child's confusion of movement with purposiveness is not a case of systematized 'projection' or intrusion of mind into matter, but an instance primarily of indissociation. The notion of the universe as a network of intentions, a social order amenable to human in- fluences, is a direct derivative of the primitive continuum of infantile experience, which is at once pre-psychic and pre-physical. There is therefore no need to invoke in explanation the complicated mechanisms of transfer and displace- ment, or of compensation and defence, characteristic of the compulsion neurotic. At certain turns of the argument, incredulity is likely to assail the reader. Doubt as to the spontaneous displacement of animism by artificialsm, in the absence of specific religious or deistic tuition, is, however, speedily allayed by Piaget's ingenious marshalling of evidence, from his own records and those of Sully, James, Freud, Rasmussen, Cramaussel. Artificialism, or the reference of all natural objects to a human or anthropomorphic agency, originates, it appears, in curiosity concerning birth, and is fed by the child's observation both of himself as a natural cause, and of his dependency upon his parents. In its final phase, it approximates the notion of Nature as the supreme artificer singled out by Brunschvicq, in his recent study, as the salient feature of Aris- totle's physics. Instead, therefore, of religious teaching influencing his think- ing, the child is found to assimilate it to his autonomous thought, distorting and altering it. Genuine religious emotion, Piaget believes, is possible only by transfer and sublimation, as the child's spontaneous deification of his parents declines. In respect to certain other matters, scepticism is less easily dispelled. In spite of Piaget's scientific caution and acumen, data pass muster as evidences of persisting animism which seem to the reviewer mere artifacts of the method of reiterated quizzing. Furthermore, the author appears now and again to read into his records more significance than his own earlier findings with respect to the pre-casual use of why and because through the sixth year, and the casual linkage of statements through juxtaposition rather than logic (syncretism and transduction) would seem to warrant. It is especially difficult, in the light of fairly fresh and definite memories of the sixth and seventh years, to view the childish statement that the sun and moon follow us as we move from place to place as more than a fafon de parler: too slight in import, certainly, to bear the weight of the whole structure of childish animism and participation (pp. 214-215). One wishes that Piaget had recorded more meticulously the social status, schooling, and contacts with cultured adults of the children quoted; since socialization is admittedly an important factor, under which sophistication and depersonalization of the world set in fairly early. While he reports results from a fairly wide geographical range, the application of his method to Amer- ican children of varied social strata, age-levels and intelligence differences is eminently desirable as a check upon the universality of his conclusions. In corroboratory work, moreover, attention should be devoted to securing a greater uniformity of Einstellung than is apparent in accounts of the method as used at the Maison des Petits.
