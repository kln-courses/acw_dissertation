<plain_text><page sequence="1">Writing Professionally This new column will appear in every other issue of the Journal. Written alter- nately by Drs. Robert Goldbort and Ray Dolle , it represents a resurrection of the "Technical Writer " column the Journal published during the early 1990s. Effective writing is a skill that nearly everyone can benefit from, and we hope you both learn from and enjoy " Writing Professionally." Robert Goldbort, M.S., M.A., Ph.D. Some Issues in Scientific Language: Precision, Conciseness, and English as a Second Language Introduction In for "writing publication, up" Introduction In "writing up" their research findings for publication, scientists naturally must present their findings as clearly, concise- ly, and rigorously as possible. Readers will expect the emphasis to be on understandabili- ty and evaluation of the information rather than on the "elegance" of the words them- selves. Clear, concise, and rigorous research writing relies on language that favors simplici- ty, precision, and directness. Such writing must be, in short, measured and "plain." Or, as the Council of Biology Editors (1994) puts it: "Effective scientific prose is accurate, clear, economical, fluent, and graceful." It should not be surprising that the effectiveness of sci- entific wńting is a direct function the writer's thinking : In agronomist Martha Davis's words, "You think well; you write well" (1997). For Davis, the best set of rules for scientific writing is that proposed by Nora Ransom, who teach- es that subject at Kansas State University; Ransom's rules are as follows: 1. If it can be interpreted in more than one way, it's wrong. 2. Know your audience; know your subject; know your purpose. 3. If you can't think of a reason to put a comma in, leave it out. 4. Keep your writing clear, concise, and correct. 5. If it works, do it. i Here I will focus on Ransom's fourth rule. Among the many issues raised by this rule, I have picked, rather arbitrarily, the following three: choosing words for their precise and correct meaning; revising wordy construc- tions; and avoiding some of the pitfalls that await second-language authors (non-anglo- phone authors). Close attention to these three aspects will enhance substantially the rigor and clarity of how one communicates scientific information. Precision in Word Choice Even scientists will on occasion use words or terminology imprecisely or incorrectly. Out of any number of possibilities, here are two sets of commonly used and misused terms to illustrate this point (Council of Biology Editors, 1994): (A) Demonstrate, exhibit, reveal, show: The first two words often are used inappro- priately as stilted words for show. Demonstrate should be reserved for a deliberate action intended to illustrate an action or procedure: "The technician demonstrated how to operate the spec- trophotometer." Exhibit is best used to mean a deliberate action whose purpose is to make something visible: "She exhib- ited the mineral specimens at the last congress." These terms should not be used to describe someone passively car- rying something apparent, as in "The patient demonstrated (or exhibited) a rash," which is an inaccurate way of say- ing "The patient had a rash." The verb reveal describes the action of making vis- ible what has been in some way hidden or unapparent, and it should not be used as a synonym for "report." Be careful to avoid anthropomorphic constructions (i.e., constructions that ascribe human attributes to nonhuman entities); an inanimate agent cannot "demonstrate" anything. Therefore, do not use con- structions like "The data demonstrate a decrease in heart rate at higher doses" or "Asbestos contamination research has revealed the range of neurological effects of asbestos inhalation." (B) Infectious, infective, contagious: Infectious should be used to mean harbor- ing a potentially infecting agent or having been caused by an infecting agent, as in "an infectious disease." Infective is properly used to indicate an agent that can cause infection: "Not all bacteria typically pre- sent in that environment will be infec- tive." Contagious means that the infecting agent in an infectious disease has a high probability of being transmitted. The preceding examples illustrate the task that scientific writers and editors have continued on page 42 September 2001 • Environmental Health 41</page><page sequence="2">continued from page 41 as they attempt to ensure that intended meanings are conveyed with clarity and pre- cision. Some words may have a more disci- pline-specific meaning. Professional dictio- naries may also be helpful, such as the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms (Parker, 1989) or the Academic Press Dictionary of Science and Technology (Morris, 1992). Wordy Constructions As biologist Antoinette M. Wilkinson (1991) has noted: "Wordiness, whether through redundancy, tautology, or circumlo- cution, obstructs the clear presentation of the research findings and concepts, and wastes the reader's time." Wilkinson men- tions some of the various ways that extra words can sneak into scientific writing if one is not vigilant. Matthews, Bowen, and Matthews (1996) remind us that verbal "fillers" in spoken English have no place in scientific writing, but somehow they always appear and must be removed in the revision process. For instance, in the following sets of phrases, the first choice should be replaced by the second: • "It would thus appear that" becomes "Apparently," • "It is possible that the cause is" becomes "The cause may be," and • "In light of the fact that" becomes "Because." Or consider the words that unnecessarily accompany certain verbs and other parts of speech, such as the following (italicized): refer back; check up on; all of; continue on; large in size; many in number; red in color; completely eliminate; and reason why. Perelman, Paradis and Barrett (1998) provide a range of other examples of how wordiness can occur in scientific writing. In the follow- ing case, for instance, replacing (C), a pas- sive construction, with (D), an active one, reduces the number of words needed: (C) Passive: "The matter of personnel health hazards associated with airborne free chlorine or other gases apparently has not been considered in this excavation plan." (Note that this indirect wording leaves out the main agent, the excavation planners , retained in [D] .) (D) Active: uExcavation planners apparently have not considered how airborne free chlorine or other gases might cause health hazards to personnel." Wordiness also results from excessive nom- inalization (constructions that turn verbs into nouns) (Perelman). Nominalization increases wordiness because it requires use of both a noun and a verb instead of just the verb form: • "A wringlet may cause the introduction of a discontinuity in the lift distribution curve" versus "A wringlet may introduce a discon- tinuity in the lift distribution curve." • " Regeneration of the resin bed is achieved by a calcium chloride solution" versus "The resin bed is regenerated with a calci- um chloride solution." (Note that the loca- tion of the main action has shifted, prop- erly, from the nominal subject to the verb.) Wordiness can invade scientific writing in numerous other ways. Examples include unnecessary repetition throughout a paper and "overloaded" sentences - that is, sen- tences that contain too much information for the reader to follow easily. Second-Language Challenges Clarity and precision in scientific writing sometimes may be weakened by usages or constructions frequently practiced among non-anglophone writers. Most second-lan- guage errors are readily detected and revised by editors. It is helpful, however, to keep a record of such errors in the editorial office's in-house style manual for future reference. Here are some examples of common errors by authors for whom English is a second lan- guage (Council of Biology Editors, 1994): • Prepositions: Spanish de does not auto- matically become of. "Son de Africa," for example, translates as "They are from Africa," not as "They are of Africa." • Progressive verb tenses: Some variants of English, like those of the Indian subconti- nent and neighboring countries, use pro- gressive tenses of verbs more liberally than does standard English: "We are finding evi- dence of neurological effects" versus "We have found evidence." • Verb position: In non-English languages, the predicate (a verb indicating the state or action of the subject of the sentence) may be properly placed at the start or end of a sentence, whereas in English, the predi- cate takes a different position: "It was found by Johnson (1992) significant aquatic contamination" versus "Significant aquatic contamination was found by Johnson (1992)." • Incorrect use or omission of articles: This is a common error among some second- language authors, who may write, "Investigator should be aware of this limi- tation" rather than "The investigator should be aware of this limitation." Note, however, that when a plural form implies that the noun represents a category rather than individuals, the article is not need- ed: "Investigators should be aware of this limitation." • Inappropriate use of gender in English: English nouns generally are assigned fem- inine or masculine gender only when they represent persons or animals of female or male sex, linguistically referred to as nat- ural gender. Some languages, however, assign grammatical gender to nouns with- out sex gender, and non-anglophone writ- ers may carry this practice into English: "The new product was naftifine, and his potency was similar to clotrimazole against strains of Candida albicans " versus "The new product was naftifine, and its potency against strains of Candida albicans was similar to that of clotrimazole." In addition to grammatical and syntactical difficulties that arise from second-language usages, vocabulary can pose challenges. Many nouns in non-English languages may resemble or be cognates of English nouns but carry dif- ferent meanings. For instance, the French actuelle means "current" in the title of a review paper; in English, however, actual more fre- quently means "existing" or "real" (in contrast to "potential"). In the title of a paper, its use would be unidiomatic. Non-anglophone authors also may incorrectly "translate" a noun into an apparently English equivalent, perhaps writing, "His work was on the causal- ism [from French] of infectious diseases" rather than "His work was on the etiology [English medical term] of infectious diseases." Resources do exist for non-anglophone authors who are not highly experienced in writing in English. Before submitting their manuscripts to an English-language jour- nal, these authors should have drafts of their papers reviewed by readers with a strong knowledge of English idiom. Numerous multilanguage dictionaries are also available for many fields. The Medical Research Council of Canada has developed special bilingual glossaries, which may be obtained from Canada Communication Group Publishing in Ottawa (&lt;http:// sis.agr.gc.ca/brd/pub/sales/english/html/ order_e.html&gt;) or from International Specialized Book Services in Portland, Oregon (&lt;http://www.isbs.com&gt;). continued on page 56 42 Environmental Health • September 2001</page><page sequence="3">Writing Professionally continued from page 42 Conclusion Ensuring that a scientific paper or any other research document uses words precisely and is written in proper, idiomatic English is no easy task. The final text should be both sim- ple and thoughtful, with a fluency that calls for no more effort than necessary on the part of the readers. To achieve this level of clarity, precision and overall rigor, writers must be willing to repeatedly scrutinize their manu- script, with the help of other resources and reviewers, as well as common sense. The advice given by biologist Michael Katz (1985) is to let your paper's first draft gestate for a few days; after this period, fully clarify for yourself the basic point you wish to make and proceed to revise with that point in mind: "Simplify and clarify, and write a paper that is disarmingly straightforward and to the point." As easy as that may sound, authors can achieve such clear and simple writing only by giving careful attention to the use of words that are appropriate to the specific scientific purpose at hand.
