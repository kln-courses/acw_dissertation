<plain_text><page sequence="1">Putting the gnas Back into gnas-skor: Rethinking Tibetan Buddhist Pilgrimage Practice Toni Huber One of my long-standing research interests concerns the set of conceptions of the physical world or environment held by Tibetans and Tibetan-speaking Himalayan peoples. 1 am interested in how they express and live out relationships with their physical world (zhing-khams or gzugs-kfiams in modern colloquial Tibetan) or cognized environment while both assuming and sometimes representing this set of views about it. This is a potentially vast topic, and to date I have directed my research to the study of those parts of the physical world which Tibetans classify using the term gnas and its related compounds, particularly gnas-chen, gnas-mchog and gnas-ri. Thoughtful Westerners writing about this general Tibetan category of place and/or space have translated or glossed those terms variously as 'holy place,' 'sacred site or space,' 'Pilger- plätze,' 'Wallfahrtsort,' 'lieux-saints,' 'power places,' 'sacred geography,' and so on. A fuller account of gnas and its inter- pretation in relation to the ritual processes of Tibetan pilgrimage follows below. However, I will briefly prefigure the points of my longer discussion here. The Western equivalents of gnas listed above attempt to capture the Tibetan conception of these sites or zones as being extra- ordinary because they are 'consecrated' or 'empowered,' and that they involve specific relationships between them and persons (and also between persons) by way of practices such as pilgrimage. It is precisely because of their extraordinary nature in the estimations of Tibetans that certain types of gnas and the human activities at them are worthy of research. Some gnas of central importance, such as the pilgrimage mountains of Ti-se (Mt. Kailash) or Tsa-ri, attracted and brought together in both space and time very large numbers of different people who can be described as sharing a common world-view. A few years ago I wrote that ...these places are more than just putative centres of other-worldly or supramundane power. Holy places are also</page><page sequence="2">24 THE TIBET JOURNAL a focus for human power in its various manifestations; they are centres where people are required to confront and invest in prescribed ideas and beliefs... (Huber 1994a). I would now add that because of their definitions and the ways in which people are either motivated or directed to relate to them, such sites and their use have a great potential to provoke more explicit statements and representations of the Tibetan world-view and its dynamics. However, this potential and the explanatory power that it can offer for an analysis of Tibetan society has not been fully recog- nized in the majority of Western studies of gnas and the ritual life associated with them. Both Tibetan clerics and Western scholars tend to explain ritual behaviour that relates persons and gnas together (e.g. pilgrimage) exclusively in terms of a system of Indie Buddhist metaphysical imperatives involving karma, merit, rebirth and ultimately nirvāna. Privileging Indie doctrinal explanations for what Tibetans do and say has drawn the analytical focus away from a closer investigation of the assumed emic categories, such as 'place/space/ 'person' and 'substance,' and the qualities assigned to them, which Tibetans work with and even make explicit in a whole range of ritual scenarios. The result has been that both implicit Tibetan understandings of the world and the embodied ritual experience of Tibetan pilgrims have been largely overlooked, as have their social significations. Much of what I will outline in the following introductory section may seem quite familiar to experienced scholars of Tibetan culture. However, as I intend to show, the most fundamental and 'obvious' is often that which is most easily overlooked. TOWARDS AN UNDERSTANDING OF GNAS In Western sources the Tibetan word gnas is translated most often as 'place' ('lieu,' 'Platz'), and less often as 'locality' and 'site'. In one very general sense that is what it means for Tibetans when they speak and write it. But in many instances where it occurs in compounds and as a verb, sometimes written gnas-pa (what Gold- stein terms an 'involuntary verb' in modern Tibetan), it has a much more active usage carrying the meaning 'to exist,' 'to be,' 'reside' "or 'abide/ 'to stay' or 'remain/ and even 'condition [of existence]'. Although the English 'place' can carry some of these meanings, in</page><page sequence="3">PUTTING THE GNAS BACK INTO GNAS-SKOR 25 general it is used as a spadal referent or marker, whereas the Tibetan usages carry a much stronger sense of existence, being and ontological value or status. Besides, there are many Tibetan words that could be translated as 'place' or provide a spadai referent in various contexts, such as khag, go, grotig, cha, yul, sa and its various compounds, and so on, which do not carry the strong sense of 'an abiding/ existence or presence of being assodated with gnas. it is a well known feature of Tibetan culture, both pre-modern and contemporary, that the physical environment in both its animate and inanimate dimensions is believed to be occupied by a host of deities and spirit forces. They range from minor autoch- thons to supreme Tantric deities and Buddhas, and can exist in the world-space as a totality, by pervading all things in various ways, or reside at sperific locations, being both mobile and fixed. Humans can be involved in a great variety of intentional interactions with all these beings, actions that are ritually mediated by the practices of both the 'folk religion' ( mi-chos ) and various forms of Tibetan Tantra. Unintentional interactions, most often considered negative, are also a possibility in every aspect of life. The term gnas and its compounds most often designates the abodes of all of these deities and spirits and their associated states of being, variously conceived. They may be in existence at, or dwell in, locations (gnas ) in space (nam-mkha'), substance or matter ( rgyu ), bodily forms (gzugs-can ), or in some cases pervade or appear in all of these simultaneously. RELATIONS BETWEEN PERSON AND PLACE In daily life human beings can also be said to have a gnas, usually their natal or home place, but they themselves can be a gnas for other classes of beings at the same time. The division between human beings and these other forces living in the world has never been sharp in Tibetan thinking. This has important implications for the types of relationships Tibetans usually recognize between persons and aspects of the physical world, such as places and objects, that are apparently external to, and discrete from them. There are various features of the earlier pre-Buddhist Tibetan religion, and of the later folk religion, which indicate this. In beliefs about the king in the pre-Buddhist Tibetan royal cult we find identities established between place, person and deity. According to some central narratives the early kings descended</page><page sequence="4">26 THE TIBET JOURNAL from the heavens, arriving upon the earth on mountain summits. The first six kings also ascended back to heaven from the mountain summits, and hence left no corpses behind. The seventh king was killed and his body was buried in an earth mound tomb, such as those still extant at 'Phyongs-rgyas and other places in Tibet. The person of the king was assimilated to the mountain through his sku-bla, the ruler's personal guardian deity, which was identified with the mountain itself. The sku-bla, as deity and mountain, was conceived of as the support of the ruler's vital principle. The king and his sku-bla were reunited after death when his body was buried in the earth mound tomb, which itself was assimilated to both the king and mountain. The tombs were called 'mountain/ and the names they were given related closely to those of the kings (A. Macdonald 1971:esp.298-309; Stein 1972:202-3). These ancient identi- fications resonate with other Tibetan ways of thinking, such as the popular notion of bla. The bla, the 'vitality7 or 'life-power' principle (often translated as 'soul' or 'âme'), is an indigenous notion which relates to the conceptions both of person and of place. Although belief in the bla principle has many aspects (Karmay 1987; Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956:481-3; Stein 1972:226-9), what is of interest here is that the bla does not just reside ( bla-gnas ) within the human body or outside of it in other living organisms, such as animals ( bla-sems-can ) and trees (i bla-shing ) or objects like stones ( bla-rdo , bla-g.yu). The bla of in- dividual persons, or of family and clan units, religious sects or even the whole of society can be strongly connected with places as they reside in landscape features like lakes ( bla-mtsho ) and mountains ( bla-ri ). The bla-gnas concept holds that persons and places are involved in some degree of mutually determinate relationship. For example, if a family line dies out the bla-mtsho with which it is associated will dry up as a result; or if the earth were to be dug up at the bla-ri of a particular person, they would be taken ill as a consequence. This is still the case today as it was in the past.1 Stein has proposed that bla and lha, the 'gods,' were once compounded in Tibetan thinking. And, as in the case of bla, the 'go-ba'i lha or personal protective gods ( dgra-lha , pho-lha and mo-lha/phug-lha) and yul-lha or the 'gods of the country7 not only dwell in the human body but are also found as much in the natural environment and in places of habitation, such as the house or tent</page><page sequence="5">PUTTING THE GNAS BACK INTO GNAS-SKOR 27 (Stein 1972:227-8; Tucci 1980:187-89). Their importance is still attested to in recent Tibetan domestic ritual (Aziz 1978:253). Samuel has summarized much of what I have just described, and proposed that a shift in conception of these relationships between place, deity and person did occur with the growth of centralized political power and literacy: It would make sense to assume that the bla/lha concept ori- ginated in a set of shamanic modal states. Originally, the spirit-essence or life-force within the individual would have been constituted by this set of forces active both within the individual and in the external world, where they were asso- ciated in a typically shamanic manner with specific places, primarily the local mountains and lakes...As centralization took place, particular families and their mountain gods would have come to enjoy especially high status. The shamanic modal states gradually transformed into gods as they came to be seen as outside the individual rather than both within and outside.2 At some levels of earlier Tibetan society a separation appears to have taken place. Yet, while noting that certain 'shamanic' type practices are still current in Tibetan cultural life, Samuel further points out the 'shamanic' character of later Indian Buddhist Tantra adopted by Tibetans, in the logic of which "...the deities of the mandala are not simply divine powers external to the individual. They can be evoked within as well as outside the individual."3 Such observations are important as a basis for interpreting what happened when Indian Buddhist ideas entered into and developed in a Tibetan cultural milieu. During this period, important models were established for the relationship between human beings and the world. On one level, 'nature' was 'conquered' (' dul-ba ) by 'culture' (i.e. Buddhism), and this was understood in terms of the powers believed to reside (gnas ) in both the person and the world. Some recent studies (e.g. Gyatso 1989; Huber 1990) have treated Tibetan notions and representations of place as 'sites' where meanings were contested during the transfer of a foreign Buddhism into the local Tibetan environment. In relation to certain 'ideological dramas' of this transfer process as it involved Tantra, such as the pervasive Rudra/Mahesvara-Cakrasamvara/Heruka scenario, other</page><page sequence="6">28 THE TIBET JOURNAL studies have drawn attention to several points relevant to the present discussion.4 First, in the Tibetan narratives the outcome of such dramas is not represented as being clear-cut. In their initial stages, at least, they result more in a state of equilibrium which is established provisionally between the pre-existing powers and Buddhism, rather than the complete replacement and total victory of the latter over the former. Second, the analysis of this process by Tibetan Buddhists is made in relation to particular geographical sites - the dramas are tied into actual landscapes in terms of these being the residence places ignas) of the spirit-powers involved. Third, these dramas can ultimately result not just in the redistri- bution of spirit-powers in landscapes or places but also in bodies. The pattern for this can also be seen in indigenous Tibetan beliefs about places, bodies and deities or vital principles mentioned above. Stein has proposed that in Tibetan thinking "...the re- presentation of the universe, like that of the human body, was modelled on the dwelling house.. .the human body, the house and the local environment are so many microcosms.. .of equal validity."5 As Samuel's comments above have already indicated, there are strong parallels here with Tantric Buddhist systems of thought, such as the vajrakãya doctrine found in the Rudra/Mahešvara- Cakrasamvara/Heruka scenario, and of this one could use Stein's words to state 'the representation of the universe, like that of the human body, was modelled on the dwelling house [of the arche- type deity (yi-dam ), i.e. the mandala palace].' In both Tibetan and Indian Buddhist Tantric representational systems the cosmos/world- system, the body and the dwelling have ontological arrangements with analogical correspondences at their various levels. In her analysis of the myth of the 'Supine Demoness' Gyatso draws attention to the Tibetan proclivity to read features of the landscape as animated. She states "The image ranges from one of a being who inhabits a certain place.. .to the place itself as con- stituting the spirit of a deity of some sort... to the perception of the actual contours of the land as being anthropomorphic or animal- like, by virtue of which that place is thought actually to be the being so outlined" (Gyatso 1989:49). In the present context her observations about this aspect of Tibetan notions of place are most pertinent, as she states, "Once conceived [of in this way]... Be the spirit propitiated or suppressed, the point is that the analogical,</page><page sequence="7">PUTTING THE GNAS BACK INTO GNAS-SKOR 29 animated, projective perception remains. It is a basic feature of what R.A. Stein calls the 'nameless Tibetan religion/ But it fully pervades organized Buddhism and Bon as well." (p.50) So for Tibetans other classes of beings do not just inhabit (gnas ) the environment, they actually contribute to the determination of its physical appearance. The same is also true of the 'dwellings' they are thought to occupy. Just as the language of the folk religion denotes the stone cairn of the god of a mountain pass as a 'castle' (mkhar) or describes a mountain summit in detail as the 'grand tenf ( gur-mchog ) of the local protector goddess, so too do Tibetan Buddhists apply a great deal of architectural language to the lakes, mountains and other features which are landscape 'palaces' ( pho-brang ) of Tantric deities. Just as Tibetans negotiate human-built edifices ( stūpa , monasteries, shrines, etc.) and orient themselves in relation to them, so too must they take account of those 'edifices' imaged in the physical environment. All the points I have just discussed are fundamental to Tibetan conceptions of gnas. Implicit in the understanding of gnas is that persons and other parts of the environment and their constituent substances and spaces can be conceived of in a variety of ways, and involved in a range of relationships and/or correspondences and identifications. While this is generally true of many cultures, it has sometimes been forgotten in the case of Tibet when Westerners study Tibetan rituals, such as pilgrimage. These ideas are supported by both long-standing aspects of the pre-Buddhist world-view and later Tibetan Buddhist Tantra. In all these aspects we find expressed forms of an active continuity of existence and identity between persons, places and their physical sùbstances, and the vital powers and divine beings that are believed to inhabit the environment. The actual processes by which this unfolds will be discussed below. Before proceeding it may be well to recall here that gnas are not only aspects of the natural world, such as landscape features. Many of the conceptions Tibetans might apply to mountains and lakes, for instance, can also be applied to certain architectural edifices (e.g. stūpa), human-made objects (e.g. religious icons), and particular persons (e.g. Dalai Lamas, or Tantric yogins in particular meditative states) because they are considered to be, or to have, deities per- manently or temporarily in bodily 'residence'. In many senses gnas are like rten, or are in fact treated as a sub-category of rten. For rten</page><page sequence="8">30 THE TIBET JOURNAL Jäschke's Tibetan-English Dictionary, p.213, has 'visible repre- sentation, symbol' (as images of Buddha and divine objects or beings), 'receptacle' (as shrines and stūpa), 'seat, abode, residence, of a deity, sanctuary7; and for the verb rten-pa 'that which holds, keeps up, supports'. I would add to this that rten are not just physical edifices, but can also be mental constructions that are 'visible' in certain contexts. Structures and objects become rten by having a deity projected onto them or invited to take up residence (gnas) in the consecration ceremony termed rab-gnas (Bentor 1992). PUTTING THE GNAS BACK INTO GNAS-SKOR Most of these ideas have been circulated, discussed or published, and there is much historical and ethnographic material to support them. What is more, there are certain parallels to them described and discussed in the large body of literature on neighbouring South and East Asian societies. What does all this have to do with pilgrimage? I would venture to say that pilgrimage in its various manifestations is one of the most widespread ritual ensembles practised in the Tibetan cultural world. Its universality as a major form through which persons and places or sites are ritually related is beyond doubt. Yet, the growing body of studies and reviews of Tibetan pilgrimage practice appears not to have taken careful and systematic account of all these conceptions about gnas. Tibetan pilgrimage is certainly a complex phenomenon, being motivated by various goals, employing multiple dimensions of ritual activity and directed towards a huge range of gnas and rten. There are fundamental Tibetan conceptions of what a 'pilgrimage' is which do not correspond well with the meaning of that word in English and other European languages: generally, 'a journey to a holy place'. Nor do they correspond entirely with the Sanskrit terms pradaksiņā (lit. 'moving clockwise') or yãtrã ('journey'). A careful etymology is vital here. For 'pilgrimage' Tibetans commonly use the terms gnas-skor (lit. 'going around a gnas'), and gnas-mjal (lit. 'to encounter/meet a gnas'). These two compounds are inter- changeable, and both the verbs bskor-ba and mjal-ba (an honorific form) are frequently used in oral and written descriptions of pilgrimage practice. A Tibetan pilgrimage then is generally a circular journey around a gnas which constitutes and/or involves encounter(s) of some kind.</page><page sequence="9">PUTTING THE GNAS BACK INTO GNAS-SKOR 31 As a circular journey it differs from the English 'pilgrimage'. Although the term pradaksiņā implies a 'centre' or 'place' which one must go around, explicit notions of gnas and mjal are missing from that term, and Tibetan gnas-skor can be performed in both direc- tions. The cliché is 'clockwise for Buddhists, counterclockwise for Bon-po/ yet in practice, at sites that are important and popular, this is not necessarily the case. For instance, at Kong-po Bon-ri Bud- dhists circumambulate counterclockwise (Karmay 1992:531), while at Tsa-ri on Dag-pa Shel-ri the Bon-po circumambulate clockwise, and all women do half a circuit in each direction (Huber 1993). There are other exceptions. I see no problem with translating the term gnas as 'place' in the context of pilgrimage as long as Tibetan understandings and as- sumptions about gnas are taken fully into account. The most important Tibetan pilgrimage 'places' are termed gnas-chen (some- times gnas dam-pa, gnas rtsa-chen-po or gnas-bzang in colloquial speech) and gnas-mchog, which could be translated as 'great place/abode' or 'principal place/abode'; and gnas-ri as 'mountain abode,' most often of a regional deity (yul-lha). Such terms can be applied to natural landscapes, urban sites (e.g. Lhasa), religious structures and icons, or the place of residence or 'seaf (gdan-sa ) of high lamas and incarnations. In a more specialized Tantric context the word gnas is used to translate pttha, one class of ritual site listed in the anuttarayoga-tantra texts and their commentaries. According to Tibetan etymologies I have collected, gnas in the term gnas-skor always carries the double meaning of the actual physical place, and of the residence or existence of deities, entities or beings believed to be powerful or significant in some way by the pilgrims who go there for an encounter ( mjal-ba ). There is much ritual evidence to suggest that the physical 'stuff of the place and the vital principle or being that resides there are always so closely associated that they are considered and treated as identical. That is my brief review of the fundamental emic conceptions of Tibetan pilgrimage. The reader will have noticed that I have hardly referred to Buddhism, nor mentioned merit, karma, rebirth, let alone 'liberation'. It seems to me that any research on Tibetan pilgrimage rituals and sites must acknowledge the continuity in, and persistence of, certain aspects of the Tibetan world-view concerning places and persons and their relationship. Perhaps we</page><page sequence="10">32 THE TIBET JOURNAL could even say that when we talk of 'Tibetan Buddhist pilgrimage' what is most 'Tibetan' about it is a certain orientation to place, while what is most 'Buddhisf about it is a system of Indie meta- physical imperatives ( samsara , karma, nirvāna) which are fitted together with this orientation to place.6 But the question of what Buddhism itself is stands in need of thorough debate, and the often monolithic interpretations of Westerners need to be comparedîwith various ernie classifications and with local ethnographic and histo- rical data. Such propositions as mine need to be carefully assessed in terms of the type of distinctions that Samuel (1993) has recently proposed for Tibetan Buddhist societies, those of 'shamanic Buddhism' and 'clerical Buddhism'. I pose this here as an issue for further critical reflection. Other types of distinction appear to have been made already. There are now at least eight published Western discussions or general overviews of 'Tibetan pilgrimage' and 'Tibetan Buddhist pilgrimage' which vary greatly in length and detail.7 They all provide interesting materials, and some are cited as standard references on the subject. The three longest of these pieces never mention the terms gnas-skor and gnas-mjal or their etymologies. Many of them emphasize the ritual primacy of pradaksiņā, using that term to describe what Tibetans do, and state that Tibetan pilgrimage derives from India or Indian Buddhism.8 Perhaps not surprisingly, the pieces written by anthropologists pay closer attention to the actual practices and language used in specific contexts. Some of the reviews begin their discussions of the important Tibetan sites of pilgrimage with those significant to Indian Buddhism before relating details of the so-called 'natural' or 'indigenous' sites in Tibet, while others orient their accounts towards local and regional Tibetan sites. Many of them mention that the motivations and rewards of pilgrimage are both Buddhist doctrinal ones, and less doctrinal 'worldly7 ones. Overall in these accounts emphasis is given to the role of Indian and Buddhist influences, yet at the same time attention is always paid to the so-called 'local,' 'indigenous' and 'natural' aspects of Tibetan pilgrimage. In dealing with such a diverse and complex phenomenon most scholars seem to divide the material up into that which fits with a certain view of doctrinal Indian Buddhism on the one hand, and local Tibetan data that does not fit with it on the</page><page sequence="11">PUTTING THE GNAS BACK INTO GNAS-SKOR 33 other.9 This tendency to 'splif may partly be a result of what could be called the 'encyclopedia syndrome/ of having to fit a complex subject into a small publishing space. But I think it also has to do with according explanatory priority to particular Westèrn repre- sentations of Indie Buddhism rather than looking long and hard at what actually happens or happened on the ground in Tibet. Whatever the case, I think this analytical split in the treatment of Tibetan pilgrimage will not lead to any advances in our under- standing, or in the quality of our representations. None of the accounts discussed have attempted any substantial analysis of the fundamental categories of place, space and person that Tibetans assume and work with as pilgrims. I propose that attention paid to these topics will be of benefit in future studies. PROBLEMS OF DISTINCTIONS AND INTERPRETATION In line with what I have said so far, I am also proposing a review of the ways we consider the various classes of activities and practices that are commonly attendant on Tibetan pilgrimage, and indeed often constitute in their totality what the 'pilgrimage' actually is for Tibetans themselves. I base my comments mainly on observations and participation in over a dozen different Tibetan pilgrimages in the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR), Sichuan, North India, Nepal and Bhutan during the last decade. I say this here because I think it is essential to perform Tibetan pilgrimages in order to begin to interpret them, as will become clear from my comments to follow. The whole notion of ritual, particularly as it is applied to the acts of persons from other cultures, is continually being reviewed and debated in Western social theory. I am not about to enter that process on a theoretical level, but I would like to point out certain tendencies in the way Westerners have analyzed the practices of Tibetan pilgrims, and the implications of a possible change in emphasis. In a recent overview of 'Himalayan rituals,' including Tibet, Macdonald (1987) has indicated the great variety of types of Tibetan ritual practice, made even more complex by the fact that they can also include a significant meditational component. This statement reflects the situation of Tibetan pilgrimage practice generally: difficult to define, with many aspects, and a meditational dimension as well.</page><page sequence="12">34 THE TIBET JOURNAL There is no Tibetan category that corresponds well to 'ritual', and no detailed classification either. Tucci (1980:chapts.5, 6) has pointed out the Buddhist distinction between cho-ga ( vidhi ), which can only be performed by initiated persons, such as monks, and different types of mchod-pa, which can also be performed by lay persons. But this division does not get us very far with pilgrimage practice as the 'rituals' he includes in both these categories, and many others besides that do not fit into them, are involved. To perhaps show how these terms and distinctions may be used by Tibetan-speaking peoples we should note here a proverb that Jest (1975:353) recorded some years ago, "Le pèlerinage est l'offrande religieuse du laic," which reads in Tibetan, grtas-skor 'jig-rten gyi cho-ga yin. Also, the practices related in guide-books and manuals for pilgrims are only superficially helpful. They mention either the most common Buddhist type, the standard textual formula always being 'prostration, offering and circumambulation' ( phyag mchod dang skor-ba byed-pa), or acts that are very particular to a certain site being described. In addition we must remember that such texts are the exclusive product of élite practitioners within the society. My rule of thumb in the field has been to note the frequency of various practices and acts on pilgrimages, and in written accounts, and to group them primarily on the basis of my informants' explanations, which might vary in any particular instance. This is perhaps no less crude than imposing an etic scheme, although I have found that a pattern has emerged that is different in important respects from the analysis of many Westerners. Briefly, this is that while Tibetans (including lay persons, and at times clerics and lamas) may often explain things in terms of physicality and substance, Westerners look for, and see, mainly 'symbolic/ 'mental' and metaphysical aspects. The same trend is confirmed by surveying the materials in published sources. For instance, one practice for which Tibetan pilgrimages are well known is circumambulation ( skor ) of a gnas performed by measuring out full-length body prostrations (phyag - 'tshaJ). Concerning the ritual purpose of the two common compo- nents of this 'combination act,' there is a clichéd Tibetan formu- lation which states:</page><page sequence="13">PUTTING THE GNAS BACK INTO GNAS-SKOR 35 Defilements ( sgrib ) of the body will be cleansed through prostration and circumambulation, defilements of speech will be cleansed through taking refuge and praying, and defile- ments of mind will be cleansed through praying with one- pointed devotion.10 The Fourteenth Dalai Lama recently made this observation about the practice of prostration circumambulation at Mount Kailash (the italics are mine): When you walk a circular pilgrimage route, such as this one around Mount Kailash, your feet touch the earth with big spaces between them, but when you prostrate, your whole body connects with the sacred ground to close the circle (1990:132). These Tibetan explanations focus on lus-kyi-sgrib, a form of pollution associated with substances and the physical body, and also the importance of maximum ritual contact with the empowered substance of a gnas-chen. The following Western interpretation of the same act is found in a major and recently published encyclo- pedia of religion, under the standard reference for 'Tibetan Pilgrimage': ... the more difficult the pilgrimage, the more merit the pil- grim acquires. Tibetans often increase the difficulty of their pilgrimages by measuring their journeys with full-body pros- trations. Ascetic practices of this sort are also meant to burn away mental defilements and purify the mind for further pro- gress along the path to enlightenment (Bernbaum 1987:351). The differences here speak for themselves, and this is by no means an isolated case. But Tibetans too, particularly Buddhist clerics, are often ready with 'pukkah' doctrinal explanations to justify their ritual behaviour, and a standard formula of 'chapter and verse' can sometimes be offered (Tn sütra X the Buddha said..., therefore we do this here.'). However, these accounts often do not tally at all with, or include much of what they actually do on pilgrimages, or how their fellow pilgrims explain things. But if they make a connection in all sincerity who am I to question the validity of it? It is certain that to the majority of Tibetans, pilgrimages,</page><page sequence="14">36 THE TIBET JOURNAL whatever else they may be about, are often related to concerns about merit, rebirth, and so on. I would not deny them their interpretations, but merely point out that when it comes to certain practices the classical Indie explanations offered by those who represent Tibetan activities as explicitly Buddhist are only a minority voice, and they do not fit well with the other evidence. All this highlights a general problem of interpretation which relates back to my discussions of gnas, place and person, and pilgrimage above. What is 'obvious' or completely taken for granted in a culture often lacks any form of systematic expression, as Sax (1991:10) recently stated: It is important to distinguish explicit formulations, which may be anything from simple statements to complex metaphysical systems, from the implicit categories and habitual practices - the world view - in terms of which they are expressed ... formal statements about the world and humanity's place in it are based upon certain "commonsense" assumptions and categories that, like the categories of grammar and syntax, are neither criticized, nor reflected upon, nor explicitly formulated (at least not very often). Because people rarely feel the need to formalize such categories, they generally remain implicit and must therefore be inferred from the languages in which they are encoded, the institutions in which they are em- bedded, and the thoughts and actions that they have in- fluenced. We lack an abundance of explicit, formal Tibetan theories about the relationships between persons and place, yet a great deal can be inferred about them through careful study and observation, or brought to articulation by the inquiries of outsiders to whom these things are not obvious. And I believe that many Western scholars and some Tibetans would all too readily fill this lacuna with the explicit and sophisticated formulations, such as Buddhism, that they already know well, in order to account for certain aspects of life whose logic is implicit. AN ALTERNATIVE VIEW: PLACE, SPACE, BODIES AND SUBSTANCES In the remainder of the paper I will draw attention to Tibetan practices and ideas that are commonly found in relation to</page><page sequence="15">PUTTING THE GNAS BACK INTO GNAS-SKOR 37 pilgrimages, but which, although they are mentioned in some accounts, rarely, if ever, figure in the overall explanatory strategies derived by Westerners. In doing so I will be building on all that I have mentioned above about gnas and gnas-skor, and suggesting an alternative framework for interpretation. My aim is not only to clarify basic Tibetan categories. I also hope to begin to demonstrate that the practice of Tibetan pilgrimage primarily entails the social production of what some theorists would call a specific 'ritualized body environmenf. In a general context Bell (1992), drawing heavily on Bourdieu's (19 77) practice theory, has argued that the point of the process of ritual, in terms of it being a mode of social practice, is to produce a ritualized body environment. Bell's comments on this notion provide not only a lucid application of practice theory to under- standing ritual, but also sketch a useful analytical frame within which to think about the materials on Tibetan pilgrimage I am about to present below. The process of ritual, she states, ...produces this ritualized body through the interaction of the body with a structured and structuring environment. "It is in the dialectical relationship between the body and a space structured according to mythico-ritual oppositions," writes Bourdieu, "that one finds the form par excellence of the structural apprenticeship which leads to the em-bodying of the structures of the world, that is, the appropriating by the world of a body thus enabled to appropriate the world." Hence, through a series of physical movements ritual prac- tices spatially and temporally construct an environment or- ganized according to schemes of privileged opposition. The construction of this environment and the activities within it simultaneously work to impress these schemes upon the bodies of participants. This is a circular process that tends to be misrecognized, if it is perceived at all, as values and experi- ences impressed upon person and community from sources of power and order beyond it (1992:98-99). Bell further emphasizes the analytical centrality of actions, in order to move beyond purely 'ritual space' or 'sacred space' centered studies and highlight the dialectic of body-environment,</page><page sequence="16">38 THE TIBET JOURNAL ...a focus on the acts themselves illuminates a critical circu- larity to the body's interaction with this environment: genera- ting it, it is moulded by it in turn. By virtue of this circularity, space and time are redefined through the physical move- ments of bodies projecting organized schemes on the space- time environment on the one hand while reabsorbing these schemes as the nature of reality on the other. In this process such schemes become socially instinctive automatisms of the body and implicit strategies for shifting the power relation- ships among symbols (1992:99). What then are the acts themselves and the organizing schemes, the privileged oppositions, hierarchies, and so on, often at 'play' (projected and reabsorbed) in the practice of Tibetan pilgrimage? How are they conceived of as being 'the nature of reality7? Tibetan pilgrimage has primarily to do with persons forming certain relationships with a gnas, which can also have a rten (object, building, human body, etc.) as its basis, is physically located on the earth's surface, and is assigned a particular ontological value. It is about Tibetan conceptions of the inherent power of certain places in relation to a given ontology, and how people can become involved with and capitalise on that. Mental and physical acts structure this relationship at various levels, which can involve types of representational synthesis and identification (by visualization/meditation), and a host of actual physical contacts, both those that are tangible and others that are believed to be sublime. Most commonly it is about a direct (and observable) physical, sensory relationship of person and place through seeing (in both the sense of direct encounter ( mjal ) and 'reading7 and interpreting landscape, etc.), touching (by contacting the place), positioning (body in relation to place), consuming/tasting (by ingesting place substance), collecting (substances of the place), exchanging (place substance with personal substances/possessions), vocalizing (prayers addressed to the place or specific formulas), and even in some cases listening (for sounds produced by the place). Perhaps more could be added here, but these are all classes of practices I have catalogued during Tibetan pilgrimages, and which are further attested in Tibetan and Western written sources. Some of these relational forms have a conscious 'mental' dimension. And</page><page sequence="17">PUTTING THE GNAS BACK INTO GNAS-SKOR 39 although yogins as pilgrims may practise the most exclusively mental of relational forms, such as visualizations, they attend to the physical ones as much as other practitioners, and in certain in- stances even more so. The ritual imperative is that contacts and identifications must be made, and I'am suggesting that any per- formance done during a Tibetan pilgrimage can be read in this way. When observing pilgrimages certain of these physical relational forms may be easily misinterpreted, or even missed altogether. A pilgrim who appears to be just staring at a group of boulders may be in the process of a sophisticated landscape interpretation exercise. The picking up of stones, pinches of soil or dust (often called gnas-rdo, gnas-sa, etc.) the drinking of water, and other collections and consumptions of the physical environment of a gnas are all common relational forms. Unless they are highly routinized at a particular spot, or consistent inquiries are made about them to pilgrims, or one has prior knowledge that they will occur there, much of this level of pilgrimage, and its frequency, can go un- noticed by the 'outside' observer. However, there are numerous individual references to them in accounts of Tibetan practice.11 All the same comments apply to the concern for relational exchanges, that is, the deposit of personal substances and items at a gnas, as opposed to regular offerings, such as butter, prayer flags, and so on. A whole range of mental relational forms are of course only revealed through testimonies, yet Tibetans will also give testimony of how a Tantric practitioner's deity yoga was so perfectly deve- loped at a certain place that the deity of the gnas being visualized appeared as an objective reality to others. Whatever one may think of such accounts, they reveal that the dividing line between the 'physical' and 'mental' that Westerners generally use is not always shárp for Tibetans. Again, what is perhaps more important to them is contiguity and identifications rather than distinctions of this type. I do not know of, nor have I had explained to me, a compre- hensive Tibetan formulation of substance categories and properties that could be applied to persons, places, objects, and their relation- ship, such as the way one might find Hindus using the guņa system and Indian particle theories. Yet Tibetans do make some explicit formulations about substance and body categories and properties specifically in relation to gnas and their visits to them. These</page><page sequence="18">40 THE TIBET JOURNAL formulations constitute an indigenous Tibetan explanatory basis for most pilgrimage practice which is assumed prior to many Buddhist doctrinal explanations. They implicate and explicate both non- Buddhist Tibetan as well as Indian Buddhist precedents, and they can be invoked to explain and satisfy both Buddhist religious motivations and goals as well as ones that are entirely mundane. Works discussing so-called Tibetan 'folk' culture catalogue a great variety of beliefs and practices concerning illness and cures, purification, agriculture, building, childbirth, magical practices (for love, revenge, etc.), weather-making, fertility, good and bad fortune, and so on (Chophel 1983; Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956; Stein 1972; Tucci 1980). They are sometimes referred to as 'superstitions' but they should be taken seriously, at least for the fact that they assume a set of relations between persons, substances, and gnas and their non-human residents. The consistently explicit mechanism for many of these relations is the concept of sgrib (sometimes grib), literally a 'shadow' or 'stain'. It is generally conceived as a form of pollution (or in some cases a class of noxious deities) which is strongly related to substances and various actions, and to deities inhabiting both the body and the external world. The conception of sgrib is often discussed in ethnographies of Tibetan-speaking peoples, and shown to have various implications for social relations (Mumford 1989; Ortner 1978a; Schicklgruber 1992; also Chophel 1983:3, passim; Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956: 307, 388-9; Tucci 1980:173, 201). What strikes me is that concerns about sgrib become socially manifest in the spacial ordering between persons, and between persons and gnas, and the ranking of persons and substances by degree of presence/absence of 'impurity' ( mi-gtsang-pa ). In Tibetan Buddhism the term sgrib is also used in a more complex way to describe both gross and fine physical, verbal and côgnitive 'defilements' associated with the three levels of the psycho-physical person, as we saw in the Tibetan quote concerning the cleansing of sgrib through ritual practice above. It is important to recognize that in some sophisticated Tibetan interpretations the term is used in translating concepts like the Sanskrit dvyãvaram (sgrib-gnyis), or 'twin veils/defilements,' yet to many other Tibetan Buddhists it simply denotes physical or social pollution as outlined above. The picture is complicated by the introduction of Buddhist</page><page sequence="19">PUTTING THE GNAS BACK INTO GNAS-SKOR 41 ethical concerns, and the contamination caused by 'moral trans- gression' (sdig). The foundational process of Tibetan Tantric practice involves the removal of sgrib from the psycho-physical person in four progressive stages. Here sgrib is related to a form of interior ranking of the person's abilities as a practitioner, yet this can also have external implications in the way he or she may be accorded social status and relate to place and space in certain instances. The overall picture of the role of sgrib in Tibetan thinking is much more complex than this. I only briefly introduce the concept here because in my research sgrib frequently occurred as an etnie explanatory strategy for pilgrimage practice and person-substance- place relationships from lay persons, clerics and Tantra practitioners alike. They also, even more frequently, invoke the concept of byin in this context. This concept, its translation, and its meaning for Tibetans in relation to gnas also require discussion. In the majority of Western sources byin is translated as 'bless- ings,' as it commonly occurs in compounds such as byin-can ('blessed') or byin-gyis-brlabs ('blessing'). In the context of gnas and pilgrimage in the way I have described them here I prefer to use 'empowermenf ( byin-gyis-brlabs ), conceived of as a process that affects the environment, much like the fields in modern physics, and which produces the 'empowered' (byin-can). I will explain how this fits better with most Tibetan conceptions of the term. We know that in the language of the pre-Buddhist royal cult the central figure, the btsan-po or divine king, was held to possess byin as a personal property or quality of his physical body. As an essential, powerful characteristic in this context byin is translated as 'splendour' or 'glory7 (A. Macdonald 1971; Richardson 1985). During the early translation of Indie Buddhist concepts into Tibetan, we find in the Mahävyutpatti (early ninth century) that Tibetans used byin-gyi-brlabs/byin-brlabs-pa for the translation of adhisthāna.12 The Sanskrit can be glossed by 'authority,' 'power,' 'residence,' 'abode,' 'seat/ taken from adhisthā (J sthā) 'to stand upon,' 'to inhabit,' 'to abide/ 'to stand over/ 'to govern/ etc. (Monier-Williams, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary, p.22). This is not only close to the early Tibetan conception of byin as an aspect of divine royal power, but also to how gnas are later understood. I am not suggesting that Tibetan conceptions of gnas derive from India, but that notions of power (or 'status'?) and place, and perhaps even height, are all</page><page sequence="20">42 THE TIBET JOURNAL found in the concept that Tibetans represented with byin-gyis-brlabs. As an aside, it would be extremely interesting to compare in detail Tibetan conceptions of the embodiment of royal or religio-political power and its ritual aspects with those of ancient India, for example abhiseka (Inden 1978). In Tibetan Tantra byin-gyis-brlabs can denote a specific relation- ship between a deity and practitioner. For example, in a discussion of the 'generation stage' ( bskyed-rim ) in which a deity is mentally constructed through visualization Stein states, "[The generation stage] underlies every ritual practice; for to have any effect a rite requires the presence of the appropriate deity, who thereby bestows a 'blessing' ( byin-rlabs , Sanskrit adhisthāna) the power of action on the officiant" (Stein 1972:181). But in general Tibetans understand it in a much broader context as a 'field of power' in place and space, and one can translate byin-gyis-brlabs literally as 'flooded by power,' or 'suffused with power,' hence 'empowermenf.13 In line with what I have explained here, and also some social dimensions that I will discuss below, I justify the translation of terms like gnas-chen with 'power place'. At the risk of being identified as a part of the 'New Age' movement, I opt for this term as I think it best describes overall Tibetan assumptions about such sites. Here are three short statements to illustrate how contemporary Tibetan clerics and lamas represent 'empowermenf in relation to place with three slightly different points of view. Firstly, The Fourteenth Dalai Lama states: Many pilgrims visit places where highly devout spiritual masters spent time in the past. The presence of that person makes the place seem somehow blessed or charged, as if there is some kind of electricity around it. Pilgrims come to feel these mysterious vibrations and to try to see some of the same visions the devout master saw (1990:140). Geshe Ngawang Dhargyey, a senior dGe-lugs-pa teacher reported: All objects at power places {gnas-chen) have the empowerment (i byin-gyis-brlabs ) of the deities and great practitioners asso- ciated with that place. It is like [the effects of] water soaking into things, so it includes rocks, dirt, water, plants, trees; this is also called 'empowerment of gnas (i.e. as residence)' {gnas -</page><page sequence="21">PUTTING THE GNAS BACK INTO GNAS-SKOR 43 kyi byin-brlab), for example a Heruka place (gnas) has Heru- ka's empowerment, and a Guru Rinpoche place his empower- ment. So this empowerment can be collected in the form of rocks, dirt, plant parts, and so on, and due to the Tibetans' great faith in the power of these things they do collect them (Interview, Dunedin 19 87). Lastly, a Tibetan rNying-ma-pa lama from a village in Nepal gives an interesting statement concerning empowerment relating it to Buddhist cosmology. One should note the atemporal conception of the quality of empowerment here: During the good age the whole earth was Chinlab. Now during the bad age [ bskal-pa btsog-pa] there is a deterioration [nyams-pa] of the nutritious value of the earth. Thus the fortune of humans also deteriorates. But the Buddha has established sites [gnas] where deterioration from the good age does not occur. In Muktinath the original fire burns in water in harmony, and there the rocks and soil are as they were at the beginning of time. We collect these and bring them back so we can insert them in our Chortens [stupas] and in the soil of the fields to delay deterioration, restoring to some extent the qualities of the good age.14 These are fairly sophisticated formulations by educated Tibetans who employ various Buddhist teachings for tļieir purpose, even though their interpretations are non-canonical.15 The physical and substantial nature of empowerment is even more developed in most lay accounts, and they are also more 'impersonal'. Usually the deities and 'great masters' are not even mentioned, just the fact that certain substances are empowered and if collected can be used in a variety of ways for protection, healing, purification, restoring vitality, the fertility and health of farm animals, and so on. In general they counter the effects of sgrib. Most often sgrib and byin-gyis-brlabs are fundamental aspects of a Tibetan formulation of relationships between persons, and between persons and places, especially during pilgrimage, but in other contexts as well. Generally, the two notions work together as opposites in the context of pilgrimage practice. In my recent study of pilgrimages at Tsa-ri (Huber 1993), for instance, I showed how</page><page sequence="22">44 THE TIBET JOURNAL sgrib as physical pollution for the lay practitioner or as complex psycho-physical defilement for the Tantrist are both cleansed by practising in the environment of a highly empowered gnas. Both levels of transformation can be related, albeit not exclusively, to Buddhist metaphysical goals, such as advanced rebirths, the attainment of paranormal powers ( siddhi ) and even enlightenment. But such transformations always require rituals of contact and identification to effect them, and these in turn are based on assumptions about the nature of person and place. Academic discussions of karma and defilement in the Buddhist context often treat these factors as somehow being abstract mental and cognitive elements of a person. But Tibetan materials on the purification of sdig and sgrib suggest that these are conceived of as embodied and substantial factors, and that their purification is indeed a physical process involving the pilgrim's body and the actual acts or work it has to do. In various accounts of the walking circumambulation of the famous Tsa-ri rong-skor pilgrimage procession bodily transformation and physical acts are linked. For instance the yogin Zhabs-dkar-ba, an élite practitioner of last century, stated of his experience, "When I was going along suffering the same hardships [as the other pilgrims] as well, I visualized that all my vices and obscurations had been purified" (1985:482). He also relates the same beliefs as contemporary lay persons have in the purifying empowerment gained by the ritual consumption of physical materials along the route, "The animals who eat the herbs and drink the water [here], have their defilements cleansed ( byang ), and will obtain a human body in the future" (1985:489). A monk who wrlked the circuit in the 1950s stated, "The ravine circuit is very rugged and you have to suffer a lot physically, and the more you suffer the more you wash off your sins and purify yourself. That is why people don't mind if ifs very hard."16 This is not a commonly heard type of explanation, and the process for the elimination of impurities seems to be variously conceived from different points of view. In a central part of the 'Bri-gung 'Pho-ba Chen-mo initiations, which attracted many thousands of lay and clerical pilgrims to gTer-sgrom up until the 1950s, the practitioners performed a visualization in which Vajrasattva's radiance enters and flows through the body as elixir fluid ( bdud-rtsi ) and washes out various defilements ( sgrib and sdig)</page><page sequence="23">PUTTING THE GNAS BACK INTO GNAS-SKOR 45 through bodily orifices, where they emerge as a smoke coloured liquid ( du-khu ).17 Here we begin to see a specific conception and language of bodily transformation often used or alluded to in the context of many pilgrimage rituals. It evokes the image of water or liquid and its washing and flowing action within the body. It is also applied to actual aquatic gnas, of which there are many in Tibet. Thus, in a Tibetan account of the environs of Lake Manasarovar (mTsho Ma-pham) we read of a bathing spot called "the bath which purifies defilements and moral transgressions" ( sdig-sgrib dag-byed kyi khrus), where the pilgrim drinks empowered water or bathes in it (bsTan-'dzin Chos-kyi Blo-gros 1983:213, 222). These Tibetan images are opposite to those of ascetic 'heaf (tapas) and its 'burning7 transformative power found in the language of Indian pilgrimage to the south of the plateau (and also, we should note, in the encyclopedia definition of 'Tibetan Pilgrimage' quoted above!). The ritual process of tapasyã, "the production of ascetic 'heať through actions of self-denial and austerity," is central to the conception of embodied transformation in present North Indian Hindu pilgrimages (Sax 1991:13). If any parallel Indie conception is to be sought it must surely be that of abhiseka. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS Whether cleansed, purified or flooded by power in various ways the ritually transformed body of the pilgrim attains a different status. This may be merely (and most often) a matter of personal acknowledgment, in terms of one considering one's prospects of a better rebirth to be higher, for instance, or it may be socially and publicly attested. A dramatic example of such social recognition is found in the welcoming ritual for pilgrims who finished their circuit of the Tsa-ri rong-skor procession at gSang-sngags Chos-gling monastery in Bya-yul. Lay accounts of events in the 1940s and '50s stated: The monks used to lay their large shawls ( khab-bslas ) along the ground on the path, like a carpet for the pilgrims to walk on, because they were now purified by the circumambulation. They, and others who could not make the journey, made offering there to the pilgrims as they wanted to get the em- powerment of these purified persons.18</page><page sequence="24">46 THE TIBET JOURNAL We can compare here a contemporary account of the present Dalai Lama recently visiting village communities in Ladakh, "As His Holiness approached, people covered the path with their own clothes.. .and monks laid down their shawls (Zen) for him to step on and bless" (Anon. 1986a:75). Of course the body in question here is not one recently transformed by ritual, but one which as an incarnation ( sprul-sku ) is believed by the majority of Tibetans to be highly pure and a source of byin-gyis-brlabs, technically speaking a gnas or ríen. The assumptions behind the ritual actions are the same, and they dictate the imperative of contiguity or contact. Examples of this social recognition of transformed pilgrims are found in other Asian Buddhist contexts.19 The spacial articulation of byin in Tibetan ritual is of funda- mental importance. For all types of interpreters the field of byin has a focus at the centre at which the ríen or deity of a gnas resides or has been dwelling. The more proximate, or more directly oriented one is to this ideal centre the stronger the empowerment potential and the more 'intimate' the encounter with the gnas. This has consequences for the ordering of space, and in almost all cases centraHty and relative height are given priority over periphery and relative lowness. Such vertical and horizontal hierarchies of space are most often articulated within the context of one or more idealized schemes prevalent in the rich narrative-ritual complexes of Tibetan culture. Here one could begin by mentioning the apparently indigenous sa-gsum scheme, the parallel but originally Indie tribhuvana system, the ubiquitous mandala ordering, and even, in the case of early materials, the influence of Chinese 'emboxmenť theories.20 That persons have various conditions of presence or absence of sgrib, and that gnas and other parts of the environment possess various levels of byin imply a gradient of ontological status of personhood and place. Social ranking and the relational ordering of persons in space are both related to this gradient in the ascribed quality, or perhaps better, 'value,' of being. Elsewhere (Huber 1993, 1994b) I have given detailed examples of how such a spacial ordering and social ranking was conceived of and practiced around a 'natural' gnas, a Tibetan mountain landscape viewed in the context of a Buddhist representational system. The same implied ordering and ranking is found in many other instances of Tibetan ritual involving gnas and ríen. Consider this brief Western descrip-</page><page sequence="25">PUTTING THE GNAS BACK INTO GNAS-SKOR 47 tion of an 'encounter with person' ( zhal-mjal-ba ) in the form of a pilgrimage to the Paņ-chen Lama (as gnas/rten embodying the Buddha Amitābha) at bKra-shis lHun-po in the late eighteenth century: A vast crowd of people came to pay their respects, and to be blessed by the Lāma. He was seated under a canopy in the court of the palace. They were all ranged in a circle. First came the lay folks. Everyone according to his circumstances brought some offering... All these offerings were received by the Lāma's servants, who put a bit of silk with a knot upon it tied, or supposed to be tied, with the Lāma's own hands, about the necks of the votaries. After this they advanced up to the Lāma, who sat cross-legged upon a throne formed with seven cushions, and he touched their head with his hands, or with a tassel hung from a stick, according to their rank and character. The ceremonial is this: upon the gylong [i.e. monks with highest vows] or laymen of very high rank he lays his palm, the nuns and inferior laymen have a cloth interposed between his hand and their heads; and the lower class of people are touched as they pass by with the tassel which he holds in his hand... Such as had children on then- backs were particularly solicitous that the child's head should be touched with the tassel.... After the Lāma retired, many people stayed behind that they might kiss the cushions upon which he had sat (Waddell 1895:321). Similar dynamics of ordering and ranking, although often now modified and less strictly observed, still operate in the large public initiation ceremonies and pilgrim's audiences involving highly ranked lamas which I have observed in the TAR, Nepal and India. A recent report, which describes how 8000 Tibetans from the TAR and parts of China at the 1985 Kālacakra in Bodh Gaya had a special audience with the Dalai Lama immediately after the initiation, states, "Everyone was trying to get as close to him as possible... After the Dalai Lama's departure people were seeking blessings from his chair" (Anon. 1986b: 4-5). Such accounts, past and present, again attest to the ritual priority given to physical contacts and contiguity, which assumes much of what I have stated above. Ranking and status of person and place is not just assumed</page><page sequence="26">48 THE TIBET JOURNAL in the ordering of space in these situations, it is both implicit and explicit in various other ways as it relates to presence/absence of pollution or defilement and potential for radiation of empowerment. The Tibetan language, like many others, has various levels of common and honorific speech, plus other markers that indicate rank and status. I will briefly discuss those I know of applied in written and spoken text to person and place specifically in the context of pilgrimage. In general there are two interrelated representations applied to persons: levels of purity/absence of pollution, and levels of facility of cognition. Most persons who visit gnas as pilgrims are described as falling into two main classes, that is, 'ordinary persons' ( so-skye-bo ) and 'excellent persons' or 'saints' (skyes-bu dam-pa). They can be ranked as to whether they are 'pure' (dag-pa) or 'impure beings/defiled persons' ( ma-dag-' gro/mi-gtsang-pa ) referring to the status of their sgrib and sdig. Their abilities in perception and understanding are ranked according to their level of purity (which also relates to karmic status) with the 'highesť (mčhog-rab, lit. 'most superior') described as those with 'pure vision' (dag-snang), followed by the middling' (' bring-po ) and the iowesť (mtha'-ma). Places too are ranked; just as the term gnas applied to a place denotes its ontological value as potentially greater than other locations, as explained above. The compounds of gnas, such as gnas-chen, etc., indicate places of very high ontological value. Those with the highest deities in residence, that is having the status of Buddhas and archetype deities, are called 'pure places' or 'pure abodes' {gnas dag-pa), or 'fields of purity' ( dag-zhing ), the latter term being a common synonym for the 'field' or 'world-system' of a Buddha (sangs-rgyas kyi zhing-khams). Such places possess the highest ontological value and purity, and radiate the maximum empowerment within 'their field. At advanced levels in Tibetan Tantra these distinctions between place and person run together in a socially very significant way. The main foundational practice for archetype deity yoga involves a four-stage purification process in which all three levels of defilement (sgrib) of body, speech and mind, both coarse and subtle, and a fourth level of defilements collectively, are successively purified through a system of consecrations. This prepares the practitioner through empowerment to work with, and realize identification with, the deity involved in the practice. During these</page><page sequence="27">PUTTING THE GNAS BACK INTO GNAS-SKOR 49 stages of elimination of sgrib the language applied to the practi- tioner changes from common to honorific as his or her ascribed ontological status changes. Thus for 'body' lus becomes sku, for speech ngag becomes gsung, and for mind yid becomes thugs. Not only does the person's status rise internally due to purity, it does so externally in various senses. When the practitioner has become fully identified with the deity in yoga then they have attained the same ontological status as that deity. In this way practitioners become the basis for a gnas themselves, they radiate empowerment to others and into the surrounding environment (c.f. the Dalai Lama's quote above). If the successful ability to contact and/or identify with Tantric archetype deities, Buddhas, and so on, is generally ascribed to a person in Tibetan society then they can be accorded exceptionally high rank and status. The other way this might happen is if they are recognized as an incarnation directly, as in the cases of the Paņ-chen Lama or Dalai Lama above. The social implications of this are far-reaching in the traditional Tibetan cultural world. In his comprehensive overview of Buddhism in Tibetan societies Samuel has emphasized both the religious and political importance of the 'lama,' when understood as Tantric guru/yogin and as incarnation. He acknowledges that in significant part their role and status depends on the fact that they are recognized as embodied conduits and sources of empowerment which can be ritually accessed by both an inner cult group and the lay public (1993:chapts. 13-14). The most spectacular, and now most widely known example of this to continue in the Tibetan exile period is the 'Great Kālacakra Initiation' ( Dus-'khor dbang-cheti) given by the Dalai Lama. The larger of these now frequently held mass initiations also constitute the single biggest contemporary pilgrimage events for Tibetans, and as Samuel rightly observes of the ceremonies, "Attendance at such an occasion is certainly a meritorious act in karmic terms. However, many people attend because of the incidental blessings ( chinlab ) involved" (1993:260; see also Gold 1988:146). One further aspect of contemporary Kālacakra initiations is certainly worth noting in the present context: they produce new gnas outside of the traditional Tibetan homeland. The Dalai Lama has stated that in general the actual staging of the initiation in an area has a very positive transformative effect on the immediate environment (interview in</page><page sequence="28">50 THE TIBET JOURNAL Cherniack 1991), presumably by way of the empowerment chan- nelled there during deity yoga practice and establishment of the sand mandala in the ritual. It has been reported that the Dalai Lama's blessings on a small irrigation lake near the refugee settlement of Bylakuppe and the ritual disposal of the empowered sand of the mandala into ifs waters during the 1970 Kālacakra there have led to it being recognized as a 'sacred lake/ accorded the ritual status of a gnas (Tsering 1994:22). Similarly, concerning the transformative effects of empowerment on specific substances, the Dalai Lama (1994:24) remarked of seeds he distributed to pilgrims at the Sarnath (1990) Kālacakra, "These seeds have been kept near the Kalachakra mandala for purification and blessing." A NOTE ON EMBODIED MORALITY There is a further dimension to all this involving morality, and although I have not discussed this with my Tibetan informants in detail I think it worthy of a preliminary "statement here. In Tibetan, 'purity' as dag-pa carries with it the senses of 'authenticity,' 'lightness,' 'correctness,' and its compounds denote legal correct- ness. The Buddhas and other top-ranking deities are the highest expression of moral being, and so by extension are those persons who are recognized as incarnations or fully accomplished Tantrists; they all have high dag-pa. Those ordinary, impure beings who are contaminated with degrees of sgrib are of a low moral standing relative to this. The Buddhist notion of sdig {papa) as 'moral transgressions' is often compounded with sgrib, especially in clerical discourse, to explain the gradient of moral status. But I cannot say whether it is frequently envisaged as an embodied quality by many Tibetans. Ortner (1978b) for one, has begun to discuss such matters in relation to Sherpa views of 'human nature'. If dag and sgrib are relative moral indicators, and if they are embodied properties of persons, what about the moral status of the substances of those persons, and of places described as being highly dag-pa, and the logic of transactions between them? Those who are familiar with ethnosociological accounts of Indie South Asia will notice that I am exploring the possibility for Tibet of an analogous model of the type of "transactional culture" Marriott and others have proposed for Hindu India.21 For example, they point out:</page><page sequence="29">PUTTING THE GNAS BACK INTO GNAS-SKOR 51 ... a South Asian's moral qualities are thought to be altered by the changes in his [sic.] body resulting from eating certain foods, engaging in certain kinds of sexual intercourse, taking part in certain ceremonies, or falling under certain other kinds of influence. Bodily substance and code for conduct are thus thought to be not fixed but malleable, and to be not separated but mutually immanent features: the coded sub- stance moves and changes as one thing throughout the life of ¿ach person and group. Actions enjoined by these em- bodied codes are thought of as transforming the substances in which they are embodied. (Marriott &amp; Inden 1977:228) This is related through Indian formulations to social ranking and interrelations. I think what is stated here is approximated in various ways by all the material I have presented above. Yet, it seems Tibetans do not have the same types of formal theories as Hindu South Asians do to explain why, for instance, contiguity is so important to them in many contexts. The situation seems to be the opposite. In general, what can be inferred from many Tibetan practices, ways of using language, and so on, which might lead us in the direction of such a model, is denied by Indie Buddhist doctrinal interpretations at various levels. Ironically it is Buddhism that has brought morality in an explicit manner into play in relations between persons and place. The ideological 'victor/ of Tibetan Buddhist 'conversion (' dul-ba ) dramas/ located in relation to specific landscapes/abodes (gnas ), and which are in a sense ritually ongoing, is also represented as a moral one over the forces of perversion. I think there are some important issues to be addressed here, but I am hesitant to continue this discussion without first doing further research. SUMMARY COMMENTS In reviewing Tibetan conceptions of gnas and their related rituals it has not been my aim to produce a grand theory or total explana- tion for Tibetan pilgrimages, past and present. I have demonstrated only that: i. Tibetan perceptions and experiences of the activities we usually call 'pilgrimage' are intimately related to the assumption of certain categories and qualities of place/space and person and their complex articulation during ritual; ii. that these aspects have</page><page sequence="30">52 THE TIBET JOURNAL enjoyed a degree of continuity throughout Tibetan cultural history; and iii. that they do not necessarily have anything to do with canonical Buddhism. These points have been either overlooked or understated in most previous work on Tibetan pilgrimage practice, as has the embodiment of religious experience in anthropological studies of Tibetan ritual in general. I have also indicated that the person -gnas relationship that operates in Tibetan pilgrimage practice is replete with the type of privileged oppositions and hierarchies central to the production of a ritualized body environment. They tend to be experienced, for the most part, as 'natural/ commonsense or taken-for-granted aspects of the world. For the purposes of my argument I have highlighted only some of the more durable and slow-changing aspects of this world view which have surfaced regularly in the oral, written and performative 'traces' of various discursive moments. It would be a mistake to think of and treat them as essential, unchanging and unchallenged features of a shared Tibetan culture, but rather as being adapted, contested and modified in the changing and asymmetrical contexts of lived social experience, and especially so as post-diaspora, colonized and 'modernized' Tibetan societies confront radical disjunctions and transformations. Karma, merit, rebirth and liberation may well be appealed to by insider and outsider alike in order to 'fix' an explanation for Tibetan pilgrimage. But Tibetan pilgrims are not merely the devout slaves of Indie metaphysics: their unique 'embodied knowing7 and cultural sense of a body-environment in ritual enables them to practice as dynamic and sophisticated agents in the context of a long esta- blished Buddhist soteriology. Notes 1. Stein (1972:227). Karmay (1987:101) notes how the ninth-century persecution of Buddhism in Tibet was linked to the erosion of a hill on the Sino-Tibetan border which was considered a Bod-kyi bla-ri ('vitality-mountain of Tibeť); Nebesky-Wojkowitz (1956:482) describes rituals to stop the movement of important bla-ri in Tibet. See March (1977:94) for a contemporary instance in Sherpa culture. 2. Samuel (1985:389); and (1993: chapt.l) for his definition of</page><page sequence="31">PUTTING THE GAMS BACK INTO GNAS-SKOR 53 'shamanism' in the Tibetan context, being one to which I am also inclined. 3. Samuel (1985:390). Note also the earlier comments of Tucci (1980:163). Contemporary examples of the type of Tibetan 'shamanic' and Tantric relationships to place that Samuel is discussing here are those of dpa' -bo with Mount Targo and Lake Dangra in Berglie (1980) and yogins with Pure Crystal Mountain at Tsa-ri in Huber (1993). 4. See Macdonald (1990) who brings together important work by Stein and Iyanaga; and Huber (1994a). 5. Stein (1972:204). Tibetan ideal conceptions of space as they apply to, and relate together notions of the cosmos/environment, the dwelling house and the body need to be considered here; see Stein (1972:41, 204, 210-11) and Meyer (1987:110); Corlin (1980) describes the ritual and social mandala reflected in the cosmic symbolism of the house; see also Aziz (1985), Karmay &amp; Sagant (1987) and Stein (195 7). 6. Whether one could venture the same about systematized Bon in Tibet I cannot say as I have never observed or studied any Bon-po pilgrimages in detail. 7. Bernbaum (198 7), Dowman (1988), Ekvall (1964), Jest (1975 and also 1985), Large-Blondeau (1960), Macdonald (1985), Ngawang Dak-pa (1987) and Stablein (1978). There may well be others I have not yet seen. Waddell (1895) made an early 'review' of Tibetan pilgrimage practice, but I would not include it here as it is only contemporary scholarship that concerns me. 8. This also occurs in secondary sources; see for example Aziz (1987:251). 9. Compare the related comments made by Martin (1992:191). 10.

For a range of examples see Buffetrille (1993:103-4, 1994 on gnas-rdo), Dowman (1988:102, 212), Huber (1993:111-15, 133-39, 184) Johnson &amp; Moran (1989:42, 45-6), Mumford (1989:97), Pranavananda (1983:12, 50, 127 n., 132), Waddell (1895:309-10, 320). One might also note here that the value of collected gnas substances is such that they are bought, sold and traded</page><page sequence="32">54 THE TIBET JOURNAL among Tibetans. I should make it clear that such substances are not classified as relics by Tibetans, although a relic itself may be the rten on which a gnas is based. Martin has discussed classification of Tibetan relics, and makes the distinction that "...in Tibet, the emphasis of the relic cult was less on the wonder working power of relics and more on the miraculous nature of the relics in and of themselves." (1992:183). The opposite is true of gnas substances, which are mundane materials with 'enhanced' properties. They are believed to have the power to heal, protect and so on, hence their exchange value. 12. See Sakaki Ryõzaburõ, Mahãvyutpatti: 1580-1584; 4264, 4305, 5591, 6364, 7591, 9054. 13. Compare Snellgrove (1987:634) "empowerment (adhisthana)... byin-eyis-brlabs-pa = pervaded by grace". 14. Mumford (1989:97). Lama Karma Samten, a Tibetan bKa'-brgyud-pa cleric living in New Zealand, reported that he toured the country on his arrival and collected substances from all the local gnas there. These were combined with gnas materials from Tibetan and Buddhist pilgrimage places and used to empower a stūpa built in the North Island, which he described as uniting the powers of the New Zealand and Tibetan environments (interview, Christchurch 1988). 15. For accounts showing that similar types of ideas and related practices also existed in other Asian Buddhist contexts see Schopen (198 7) and Tambiah (1984). Chinese conceptions of ling ('power/efficacy'), so commonly used in pilgrimage, should also be compared to these Tibetan ideas, see Sangren (1993) and Naquin and Chün-Fang Yii (1992:11). 16. Sherab Gyatsho (interview, Darjeeling 1991). On physical hardship and expiation in Chinese pilgrimage see Naquin and Chün-Fang Yü (1992:20). 17. See 'Bri-gung 'pho ba chen mo 'jag tshugs ma, fol.llb-12a. 18. Norbu Dorje (interview, Darjeeling 1991), Tenzin Wangchuk (interview, Thimphu 1992). 19. See Grapard's (1982:20 7) comments on Japanese Buddhist mountain pilgrimages: "It is well known that pilgrims coming back from sacred spaces were regarded with awe: common</page><page sequence="33">PUTTING THE GNAS BACK INTO GNAS-SKOR 55 people saluted them, made offerings, even tried to touch them." 20. Concerning tripartite spadai hierarchies, the sa-gsum and tribhuvana, Kvaerne (1987:499, 502) calls such a scheme pre-Buddhist; Stein (1972) describes it as a 'Buddhist symbol' (p.41), but also implies that it may be indigenous (p.202-4); see the entry sa-gsum in Bod rgya tshig mdzod dien mo, vol.3:2911; see also a Tibetan explanation in Nālandā Translation Committee (1987:230).
