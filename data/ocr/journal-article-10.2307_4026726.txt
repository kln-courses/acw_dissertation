The research was carried out from about 1970 when the goal of history of science was integration with wider social history. His book remains one of the most suc- cessful of such attempts. Of course, French's study, like so many contemporary books on science and medicine, could also claim another distinction. It was the first full-scale venture into its subject matter by a professional his- torian. Twenty years of historical research have reduced the number of virgin fields, or at least their average size. Some tracts of history are still only sketched-for much German sci- ence, the pioneer works are only now appear- ing-but for other tracts e.g. Revolutionary France or Victorian Britain, the opportunities of novelty now merge with the delights of maturity. Scholars have more good secondary literature of which to take account. Metaphors of territory can be misleading, for in scholarship new spaces can be created; by imagination, new levels of history can become accessible. But we may judge that kind of advance to be occasional rather than steady or predictable. New levels do not necessarily arrive with new generations. The enterprise as envisaged in 1970 still stands, it seems to me, and provides the context for the books here under review. No-one will claim for these, as they might have done for French's study, that they represent a new form of historical writing on science and medicine. Rather, we are here concerned with extensions. We see how diffe- rent aspects of historiography can be brought into fruitful synthesis. Partly this is a matter of bringing together different approaches, partly it concerns the bringing together of various national histories which, of course, have dif- fered in the concerns of the historians as well as in the material with which they were working. Of the works reviewed, only Maulitz is explicitly comparative, but the Coleman and Holmes volume and that edited by Rupke include studies of several countries or cities. In Coleman and Holmes, there are essays on Bres- lau, Heidelberg, Munich and Leipzig plus Berlin, as well as related material on Paris, Holland and Britain. The studies on anti-vivisection cover Italy, Germany, Scandinavia as well as Britain and North America. But none of these volumes develops any general comparative framework. If we try to make comparisons be- tween the volumes, as well as within each, then the differences between them are at least as striking as the particular questions with which each is concerned. Generally, the discussions of Britain are about the organization of medical practice, about the community of medical scientists which had emerged by the end of the century, and about public opinion. For Germany, the contributors to Coleman and Holmes concern themselves with individual universities, con- textualized within local states. There is more information on politics and economics than has been customary in studies of German science, but not much; again, there are praiseworthy</page><page sequence="2">208 Essay Review attempts to link university institutions with medico-professional developments, but all such studies suffer from our remarkable ignor- ance of medical practice in nineteenth-century Germany. For France, Maulitz presents the organization and teaching of the Paris school; other essays deal with the plurality of physiology c. 1830, and with the social roles of medical experimentation thereabouts. Collectively, these studies do much to relate 'research' activities to structures of teaching; but practice hardly enters. If we wish to develop a more general framework, we do well to recognize that teach- ing, practice, and 'research' need to be sepa- rated analytically, so that we can recognize their characteristic combinations. In Britain, most teaching was ancillary to private practice, 'research' was marginal until medicine was included in the expansion of Oxbridge and the provincial colleges. In German states, we are told, research was the key to appointment and thus to who taught; we need to know more about what was taught, and much more about how practice and clinical training articulated with university education. In France c. 1830, teaching and practice were closely linked in as much as the Paris school was dominated by clinicians known for their styles and contribu- tions to clinical medicine; 'research', in the limited sense of animal experimentation and non-clinical microscopy, was marginal. Within such a broad framework, we can first consider Maulitz's explicitly comparative questions. How did Bichat produce his pathological anatomy and how was it received and used within a large medical school domi- nated by state-salaried clinicians? How diffe- rent were the reception and uses accorded and made by British doctors? The doctrines were the product of a surgeon's apprentice who reformed 'general anatomy' and then turned to physiology and pathology; they provided a language whereby surgeons' notions of disease (as visible material alteration) could be used in a range of medical conditions; they were thus highly appropriate in a medical school which was attempting the re-integration of surgery and medicine. All that is well understood. But, says Maulitz, remember that Bichat was a young outsider, even when he died; remember that the Revolutionary settlement, in medicine as elsewhere, was endlessly renegotiated; and consider the difficulty of introducing a broad new framework into the structures of a large medical school. Maulitz, in the French part of his book, delicately explores the relation of Bichat's doctrines to the teaching practices and politics of the Paris school. He is particularly good on the relation of Bichat's doctrines to clinical practice-to the range of autopsy exami- nations, to the phenomena there dissected out. Bichat constructed his system using texts, clinical experience and extensive dissections. He did so as an extra-mural medical teacher, but no-one until Maulitz has systematically explored the relation of the new doctrines to the organized school. The problem is of interest, and not just for medicine, for it illuminates general relations between ideas and institutions. Maulitz states the position clearly (p. 35): The Faculty, along with its wholly controlled Ecole practique de dissection, occupied a critical role in the processing of medical knowledge, but not its creation. That characteristic was probably then common to most medical schools and so was another: the staff were generally polymathic, capable of teaching most of the syllabus. In larger schools, there were several clinical pro- fessors, but we need to resist any temptation to equate chairs with specialist expertise. In as much as teachers were practitioners, they were no more specialized than was normal medical practice-they followed the vexed and con- tested division between medicine and surgery. In the new Paris school, even that distinction was to be minimized: whatever the career intentions of students, they were to attend a common programme, taught by both physi- cians and surgeons. The school and its doc- trines provided a basis for some subsequent clinical specialization and such specialization might be permanent, but what were the grounds for division of teaching work within the common syllabus?</page><page sequence="3">Essay Review 209 Chemistry and botany were taught by men who were not clinicians and who might not be medically qualified. The same teachers were employed elsewhere e.g. at the Museum d'His- toire Naturelle, where medical students also attended. For such teachers, the medical school meant an income and an audience; professional status was sought in less medical institutions- the Museum or the Academie des Sciences. At the other extreme were the clinicians who taught clinical medicine or surgery, and were responsible for hospital patients. Between these two patterns fell anatomy and physi- ology, which did not involve clinical work, but which had little or no teaching or research base outside the medical school. Anatomy had its material territory-the dissecting room and pathological museum. This work was sufficiently similar to its counter- part at the Museum to form a potential double- base for career anatomists. George Cuvier's considerable influence was indeed exercised to have one of his Museum collaborators appointed to a junior anatomy post in the med- ical school; but, in general, these anatomy posts were monopolized as temporary posi- tions for surgeons. Physiology lacked the material territory; its intellectual territory-a lecture course on anatomy and physiology-was occupied by medical generalists and school administrators (Chaussier) or by physicians with theoretical and literary inclinations (Richerand). No doubt, Francois Magendie would have liked to establish 'experimental physiology' as a per- manent specialization within pre-clinical medicine; he succeeded in gaining support out- side medicine; (in the Museum and the Academie), but little within the medical school. In as much as most clinicians and stu- dents expected a general introduction to the theory of medicine, there was no reason to detach and reform physiology as an experi- mental science after the manner of chemistry. Students and young staff who sought novelties could attend extra-mural lectures. If they wanted to discuss research, then there were voluntary societies associated with the medical school. Innovations came from the outside, for the medical school was structured to other priorities. What then of Bichat's innovations, which potentially covered such a wide range of the medical curriculum? First, such a range was possible (and advantageous) precisely because he was an outsider, an extra-mural teacher. Second, his theories of general anatomy and pathology were not directly useful for surgeons (or interesting to Cuvier), so there was little chance of their being inserted directly into anatomy courses. His 'physiology' was taught in as much as it was general medical theory; it was not very different from that of Chaussier or Richerand. In as much as Bichat might have pioneered an experimental physiology in the nineteenth-century sense, his successor was Magendie. As we have noted, such experiment- alism had its followers among scientists and students, but lost out to 'general medical theory' for medical school appointments. But, if 'general medical theory' could be taught by clinicians in pre-clinical classes, it could also be conveyed by clinicians in their clinical teaching, where it could be linked to clinical and post-mortem observations. It was through such teaching, especially that of Laen- nec, that Bichat's new framework found its way into regular teaching-as the principles of a new kind of clinical practice. It would be another twenty years before a chair was created specifically for the pursuit of patholog- ical anatomy-highlighting and complement- ing what was by then recognized as a French way of doing medicine. One might note here that the pattern at the Museum was not as different as is often suggested. Botany and zoology were profes- sionalized there as sciences of collections. Neither physiology nor microscopical anatomy found much support in the early decades. Questions about animals in general did not form a separate discipline, they were usually dealt with as preliminaries to systema- tic study of specimens, much as in medicine. Again, as in medicine, there could be deep and bitter controversy about the 'true' principles involved: Cuvier versus Geoffroy versus Lamarck; Broussais versus Laennec, etc. Maulitz's discussion of the Paris School provides an immediate context for papers on</page><page sequence="4">210 Essay Review French physiology which appear in the other two volumes. In the Rupke collection, Paul Elliott has little to say on the particular ques- tion of vivisection, but rather more on the overall shape of physiology in nineteenth-cen- tury France. He stresses the role of the veteri- nary schools, which have indeed been grossly neglected by historians, and not just for France. He stresses the similarity of Bichat to the eighteenth-century vitalists and underlines the primacy of their commitment to medicine as a whole. Against this, Elliott sets a tradition of experimental physiology in which Magendie and Flourens appear among scientists, outside the institutions and traditions of the medical school. Elliott correctly points to the wide range of investigations which, in the 1820s, were encompassed under 'physiologie'-from the tradition of theoretical medicine through vivisectional vertebrate studies, to Dutrochet's general physiology, microscopy and organic chemistry. He follows Gross in stressing the importance of Cuvier as a patron, via the Museum and the Acadcmie des Sciences, where Laplace was also supportive. Almost all the individuals concerned were trained in medicine, but some failed to qualify and others never practised; some sought alternative definitions in 'natural history'. But Elliott surely overstates his case, when in opposition to Lesch, he seems to maintain that Magendian experimental physiology was essentially a natural science like zoology. Until mid-cen- tury, as he shows, it was marginal to medicine, where the physiology posts continued to be dominated by clinicians extending the sys- tematic tradition. But it was also marginal to the Museum, for experimentalists employed there usually moved to comparative anatomi- cal studies. Only in the Academie and in the College de France (where there was neither a large student body nor collections) were Magendie (and after him Claude Bernard) able to gain major roles. At the College, Magendie used for physiology a chair which had been for the general presentation of medicine. Bernard's first appointment there was to a chair which had been for botany. Both these 'outsiders' tried repeatedly to link their work to concerns of clinicians. To ignore that is to miss the essential tension in nineteenth-century physiology. In the Coleman and Holmes volume, Lesch concentrates on the Academie de Medicine, founded in 1820, partly to carry on the pre- Revolutionary tradition of medical societies advising the state, partly as a medical analogue of the Acadimie de Sciences.He argues that its high intentions for physiology and chemistry, and its openness to experimentation, bear out his general claim that the Paris Medical School (plus the Academy of Sciences) provided a favourable environment for the development of laboratory sciences. But as Lesch recognizes, the chemical and physiological work of the Academie de Medicine was minor. Experi- ments were usually directly related to clinical practice-he discusses at length an experimen- tal debate on the effect of air in pleural cavities (and veins) which seems to continue the 'mechanism of death' programme of Bichat and Nysten. Lesch succeeds in showing that some medical men supported experimental research on animals, but if there was a single clear institutional base for such work, it would appear to be the Veterinary Schools, as Elliott suggests. As British anti-vivisectionists learned with horror, French veterinary students used to train by practising operations on old horses, so experimentation was easy. Perhaps the most interesting comments Lesch presents were those of Gerdy, who was opposed to 'fanatical' reliance on vivisection, which he had found unreliable. Medicine, he claimed, had to reassert itself against the Acadehmie de Sciences which lent 'a considera- ble and almost exclusive support to the method of vivisections' (p. 129). Like the British anti- vivisectionists, Gerdy contested the experi- mentalists' claim to clinically important results, notably on the functions of the spinal nerves. Gerdy's view did not carry the day, but it is worth noting (from Elliott) that he had been a major contender when Berard in 1831 gained the Medical School's chair in physiology. But perhaps in these historiographical debates about science and medicine, theory and practice, we are still too much constrained by the polemical historical tradition founded by Claude Bernard. He was keen to elevate</page><page sequence="5">Essay Review 211 physiology above clinical medicine and anatomy (and biological science), by stressing experiments over mere observation. But such an identification of medical science with exper- imental (vivisectional) physiology is misleading if we accept its terms rather than its rhetorical significance. As the essays on Germany well show, one might reasonably claim that in the 1830s and 1840s the microscope was the promising tool for medical science. In France its use was limited, but so was experimental physiology; we need to consider this relation- ship, and the ways in which a more serious attention to French histology (e.g. that of Beclard) might strengthen our account of how French doctors saw and used 'science' and of how would-be professional researchers/ teachers related to the medical community. Societies and Journals In comparison with the socio-intellectual his- tories of German university science, these accounts of France stress the importance of societies and journals. Some of these societies such as the Academie de Medecine (as discus- sed above) were more or less formal extensions of the medical school. Some were for younger academics and would-be academics, some for students. Here there is a comparison with Gemany: in some ways the French societies fulfilled the function of seminars, as these were then developing within German universities. They facilitated careful examination of par- ticular issues, they encouraged participation, they encouraged rivalry in the production of novelty. When Maulitz comes to discuss British responses to Bichat's medical innovations, the discussion proceeds almost entirely at the level of journals and informal societies. Indeed, the great strength of this section of his book lies in its exploration of material which was largely unfamiliar even to historians specializing in this place and period. Maulitz's societies, how- ever, were not within institutions (like German seminars) or on the edges (like the French societies); rather they were associations of individual practitioners brought together by a common interest in medical politics. More par- ticularly, they were coalitions of professional groups, of physicians and surgeons, e.g. The Society for the Improvement of Medical Knowledge, founded 1793, and the Medical and Chirurgical Society, founded 1805, where interest in pathology was of the 'natural-his- torical' type. Maulitz argues that in these societies (and in Edinburgh), there was tenta- tive interdigitation of medicine and surgery but the two elites remained separate. For closer links, he looks to the advocates of general prac- tice-the politically active surgeon-apothecaries. Pathological anatomy was used in their jour- nals as a 'coalition product', but it was still not systematic, in the French manner, until the 1820s, when political infighting in London medicine and the increasing ease of medical study in Paris, led several would-be medical reformers to France. Back home they broad- cast their souvenirs, especially through review journals, one of several forms of medical pub- lishing which steampresses made more feasible. Of the later Societies, or designs for Societies, Maulitz focuses on John Farre's Academy of Minute Anatomy (1825), which presented itself as an extension of British (Hunterian) traditions. Farre was particularly concerned with the eyes, then the object of a nascent medico-surgical speciality (another link between pathological anatomy and the advocates of professional reform). By the 1830s, a couple of medical Francophiles had gained teaching places where they could expound Bichatian pathology. Thomas Hodgkin taught at Guys, but the students were not keen and he proved too socially radical for the powerful hospital treasurer. Robert Carswell, sent to Paris by his Edinburgh teachers, gained a chair of pathological anatomy at the new University College Lon- don. Here, potentially, a pre-clinical subject could be developed in its own right, not as a part of clinical teaching. In fact it was squeezed out to make more room for normal and surg- ical anatomy; the British traditions excluded the French novelties. For innovations, the key British vehicles were not schools, but journals and books, especially Forbes' translation of Laennec which sold Bichatian pathology as the basis of ausculation-a technique which Forbes deliberately distanced from the theory.</page><page sequence="6">212 Essay Review German institutions When Carswell was offered the chair of pathological anatomy at University College London, J.F. Meckel had already turned it down. In medical sciences (unlike chemistry) Britain was not (yet) ready to receive im- migrant discipline-builders. We do not know how Meckel would have managed in a medical school which could not depart far from the practical - professional orientation of other London schools. But then, we know very little about how any German teachers, even in Germany, managed medical students. The stan- dard historiography has perhaps magnified the real national differences. Only with studies such as those in Coleman and Holmes do we even begin to see how medi- cal education may have articulated with those neo-humanist university traditions which have dominated historical studies of German educa- tion. The editors provide a brief introduction (and epilogue) stressing the intricacies and con- tingencies of the relationships between ideas and institutions. They leave Kathryn Olesko to pro- vide a commentary which draws on her own his- torical experience with teaching programmes and laboratories for physical science. Though her commentary introduces many important themes, including a nice discussion of seminars as teaching and research tools, it does not synth- esize the main articles, some of which are cent- rally concerned with pedagogy, others more focused on discipline building. One of the more pedagogical pieces is that by Bill Coleman, whose recent death has deprived history of science of a true master. He concen- trates on Purkynje at Breslau, stressing his Pes- tallozian views and arguing that they were a major reason for the introduction of 'practical' work. This is a novel and important perspective, but the argument remains open. We could use more material on Purkynje's relationship with his professional colleagues at Breslau and, again, on the way in which microscopy seems to have been developed as 'physiology' when anatomy in the form of museum specimens etc., was already relatively well endowed. Attention to the content of 'physiology' courses might be helpful here and elsewhere. Are we dealing with the 'appropria- tion' of established lecture courses by medical investigators who did not wish to practise, but who did wish to bypass established anatomists? Tuchmann, in her stimulating piece on Heidelberg, nicely shows how the interests of students (and parents) in a more 'practical' med- ical education favoured the careers of Henle and of Pfeufer, purveyors respectively of the new microscopy and the new French clinical techniques. She is also able to include arguments about medico-professional reform and the defence of university courses against the less academic programmes which had been popular among would-be surgeons. How well Tuch- mann's arguments would apply to other Ger- man states remains to be established, but for the bourgeois, industrializing Baden she makes a strong link between disciplinary development and economic 'modernization'. Henle, of course, had learned his trade in Berlin, in the laboratory of Muller. There, as Lenoir notes, he had taught a small course on microscopy, using the one instrument owned by the laboratory in the late 1830s. Thereafter, microscopes became more common, as they became both cheaper and better; chemical techniques were disseminated from Liebig's Giessen school, and French clinical methods also proved popular. By 1861, it would seem, student pressures, professional exclusiveness and academic interests were sufficiently mobilized to raise the government capital funds for the laboratories in which practical courses could be provided for all medical stu- dents. From the 1860s date the big institutes, which typically combined three sections: physiological chemistry, histology and practi- cal (or physical) physiology. One of the nice questions here is why this triangular structure became common, when physiology labora- tories prior to 1850 had varied so widely in their scope and emphasis. Lenoir provides answers from his study of Ludwig, whose physiology was primarily 'physical', the study of motions. But motion of what, through what? To know how materials were transformed in the body one needed more than the 'blood and urine analysis' of common chemists. And as microscopy became more sophisticated, a Ludwig could not expect to</page><page sequence="7">Essay Review 213 elucidate for himself the micro-structures which helped explain function. Thus, Lenoir argues, Ludwig's programme, with the growth and differentiation of knowledge, made his- tology and physiological chemistry into the specialized, sophisticated hand-maidens of physical physiology. Anatomists and physiological chemists were not likely to share that vision. In the resultant disputes, as this volume so nicely shows, much depended on local contingencies. In discussing Ludwig's appointment at Leipzig, Lenoir stresses the government interest in agricultural and industrial develop- ment, thus adding weight to the 'moderniza- tion' thesis. But he also shows how university structures might help determine the kind of physiologist chosen. A specialist in physiolog- ical chemistry would be too close to estab- lished chemists already teaching students of pharmacy and agriculture etc. A physical phy- siologist fitted more easily, and could bring new strength to Wunderlich's existing pro- gramme in 'scientific clinical medicine'. So Ludwig was able to create a physiological insti- tute with histology and chemical physiology which would serve (physical) experimentation. A parallel institute for pathology would also have microscopical and chemical support. In his essay on the Munich school of physiology, Holmes addresses similar ques- tions of intellectual and institutional organiza- tion. He argues for the primacy of intellectual designs, in this case Liebig's plans for a physiological chemistry which would include the skills of anatomists/physiologists. The realization depended on the conjunction in one place of a chemist and an anatomistlphysio- logist who shared this vision. This partnership was achieved at Munich because Maxmillian II wanted Liebig as a star chemist and was willing to import Bischoff to a second chair of physio- logy. It was with Carl Vogt, a pupil of both, that the famous programme in physiological chemistry was eventually established. Such studies are important but they remain limited, not least in analyses of the relation- ships with clinical medicine. We so often assume that 'pre-clinical' sciences can be dis- cussed for Germany with no more than passing reference to clinical medicine. But microscopy and chemical analyses might have been linked directly to clinical medicine even in German schools. Why then, instead, was a tri-partite physiology developed as a preliminary to medicine? Why this separation of the scientific/ normal from the professionallpathological? We need to spell out some general answers to such international questions, as well as more specific explanations of inter-university differences. A profession of discovery in Britain For more on the peculiarities of the English, we turn to Nicolas Rupke's collection of essays on vivisection. However marginal England may have been for experimental physiology, it was a world leader in anti-vivisection agitations. The essays cover Italy and Germany, Switzer- land and Sweden, America and France: in practically all these countries, such campaigns as existed were modelled on, or stimulated by, British efforts. The cause cdh?bre of 1863 in Florence arose from the confrontation of a German physiologist, Moritz Schiff, with Miss Frances Power Cobbe, a British lady, formidable in controversy and exceedingly fond of dogs. The affair had little resonance in Italy beyond the circles of tourists and temporary residents. The Church was not keen on Schiff and his materialist friends, but it too saw animals as created for use; few Italians were anthropomorphic about dogs. England was much more receptive. A second attack on Schiff in 1873, again by Britons and local aris- tocrats, led to publicity back home which coin- cided with the notorious Handbook for the Physiological Laboratory. So the British anti- vivisection movement took form. The movement in Germany was initiated by aristocrats with British connections (and the support of Richard Wagner). The issues were debated in Parliament in the mid-1880s, when the Prussian education authorities backed the physiologists in whom they had invested much capital. The American move- ment was a pale imitation of the British. The Swedish movement (and the essay on it) were of more interest, largely because of the idealist</page><page sequence="8">214 Essay Review philosophy of its scholarly leader, Nordvall, for whom animals existed primarily for humans to demonstrate mercy; to use them in vain glorious empiricism was to allow lower uses to triumph over higher. The wide geographical range is one of the merits of Rupke's collection. Another is the way it catalogues, especially in Trohler's pieces, the various arguments pro and con. The carelessness, both moral and polemical, of sev- eral vivisectionists is well illustrated, partly by Rupke's own piece on British experimentalists. The volume also offers several 'out-riders'- Lawrence on a controversial film restaging Har- vey's discovery, Schupback on iconography, Hampson on British vivisection legislation. But for all its uses, and the merits of most of the articles, the collection must be seen as a follow- up to French's pioneering study. The wider range produces no wider synthesis. Indeed, for Britain, where the volumes chiefly overlap, only Elston's article on women and anti-vivi- section seems to me a significant advance on French, partly because it is informed by recent feminist scholarship in developing the late Lloyd Stevenson's arguments about the con- formity between hygiene, purity movements, pro-feminism and anti-vivisection. Where, then, might we go with vivisection; how could the historical study of the anti-vivi- section movement be used to illuminate the concerns of Maulitz or Coleman and Holmes? What does the opposition tell us about the rela- tion of ideas, not just with institutions, but of both with social structures and economies? Towards comparative history If we first focus on Britain and consider the aristocratic-idealist resistance to experimen- tal physiology, and the commercial-profes- sional indifference of most doctors, we may begin to see as peculiar that 'profession of dis- covery' (in medicine) which internalist history has made so familiar. The hygienic programmes of many anti-vivisectionists were life preservers, we know; practical clinicians were one's best safeguard in illness, and British clinicians had developed sophisticated ways of passing on their skills and their elan. Professional educa- tion in Britain, for lawyers or for engineers, was through such practical training. We need to remember all that when we examine the rare figures who did not conform to these patterns. How did they gain working space and social sustenance? What, in these respects, are the les- sons of comparative European history, or indeed the comparative history of professions? In largely free-market professional fields, such as engineering in Britain or America, there were certain functions which a teacher/ researcher could perform at the edges of pro- fessional work. In terms of 'reproductive func- tions', the raising of mathematical standards and the translation of engineering problems into and out of mathematics were central. In medicine, the translation of clinical problems into and out of the languages of pathological anatomy/histology or physiology may have offered diagnostic refinement and improved prognosis. The importance of the latter has been emphasized in studies of ancient medicine by Edelstein and Temkin; for the nineteenth century it is easily lost between 'science', therapy and public health; it deserves more attention. A second role of 'academic engineering' was in the testing of materials and structures, especially for new kinds of construction. There may be analogues in early nineteenth-century surgery, and perhaps in work such as that of Magendie on experimental pharmacology. But, in Britain, non-clinical medicine was obvi- ously ancillary, even in 'university' medical schools. Young professionals could deal with it; or 'college teachers' could accumulate courses on it. Scarcely anyone was primarily so employed until medical associations, with backing from medical bureaucrats, pushed for more 'college teaching' and later for 'university teaching'. Yet in several medical schools, the new full-time teachers abandoned their prom- ised research, because it gained little support. Only in universities where medicine was peripberal (Cambridge and Oxford), or in medical schools with strong university tradi- tions (UCL, King's and Edinburgh), did medi- cal research take root before 1890. At the end of the century, however, in medicine (as in electrical engineering), forms of</page><page sequence="9">Essay Review 215 knowledge emerged which spanned the scien- tific-practical divide. Bacteriology was theo- retically interesting and practically useful; it was new knowledge, developed (mostly) in colleges and research institutes. It allowed medical schools and new specialized institu- tions to sell testing services. In some of the 'practical' civic universities, and at St Mary's London, microbes were the basis of substantial research initiatives. But in France and Ger- many, it would seem, the key developments were in special institutions somewhat remote from the main medical schools. With Germany the century had begun so differently, with university schools as the com- mon pattern, dispensing a largely literary med- ical education which enhanced the culture of 'expectant' medicine. Against that background of neo-humanism, medical educators could appear as practical men, armed with the instru- ments to examine and manipulate the material world, ready to show how practical medicine could be represented in terms of experimental medical science. Pfeufer in Heidelberg, Wun- derlich in Leipzig thus appear as a frontier of translation, behind which experimental physiologists could create dynasties and insti- tutes, playing now to scientific culture, now to economic modernizers, now to professional exclusiveness; relying on medical students wanting techniques for analysis and for mani- pulation. That sort of medicine seems also to have appealed to bureaucratic patrons. A Lud- wig vivisection, with chemists and histologists in attendance, was the ultimate demonstration of how a living body could be taken over by the forces of science-a model for the age, as corpse-cutting had been for British medical students in 1830. In Paris, medical schools were clinical, as in Britain, but they and 'science' were state sup- ported, as in Germany. So medical science had a prop outside the medical schools; supporters in the Academie helped Magendie or Bernard to gain peculiar marginal niches, such as scarcely existed in London (except perhaps at the Royal Institution where W. B. Carpenter lectured on phyiology). In the medical schools, to the later-nineteenth century, medical science of the German type remained a matter for after-hours societies and demonstrations. To make comparison is to discover areas of ignorance. To read comparisons is often to be unsure how much of an apparent difference stems from different perspectives rather than different situations. The evolution of historical studies in bio-medical sciences should help to excavate the presumptions of local or national studies so that new foundations will be more extensive, serving to ground wider compari- sons. And among topics for further research two seem clear. Our knowledge of nineteenth- century physiology is now considerably deeper and broader than our knowledge of nineteenth- century medicine. It is time to analyse the dog along with its tail. It is also time for more atten- tion to anatomy, especially histology. (It cannot be as dull as suggested in physiologists' his- tory-anatomy as stagnancy, anatomy as that from which physiology is liberated.) Which parts of anatomy were merely for transmission to students? Given the educational support for anatomy in all medical schools, how was mic- roscopy to be taught and advanced? Why was microscopy included with the laboratory rather than the dead-room or anatomical museum? Or was it? Why are there no good modern studies of anatomical institutions in the broadest sense of these words? The general lesson from these books would seem to concern the need for a much wider and more truly comparative history. We can see how research programmes may be analysed as more than intellectual projects; teaching is now on the agenda; practice needs more analysis. The key question is how we handle the relationships. 'Disciplines' presume an alignment: we should not. Too much writing on modern medical knowledge has presumed that alignment, partly because disciplines are familiar to us. Whether we come from the arts, social sciences or natural sciences, university historians of sci- ence, for better or worse, understand discip- lines. Much historiography, from historians as well as practitioners, presumes the centrality of disciplinary organization, or it explores the emergence of disciplines out of 'parents'. With- out doubt, such phenomena are important; historical studies of them continue to contri-</page><page sequence="10">216 Essay Review bute greatly to our knowledge of nineteenth- and twentieth-century medical science. But, as our times change, and with them our historio- graphical interests, we may, perhaps, begin to see disciplines as but one form of organization, not a 'natural' one to which all studies tend, but one characteristic of the special conditions in some nineteenth- and twentieth-century uni- versities. The more we study industrial research or research institutes or major gov- ernment programmes of research, in our own and in previous times, the more we shall be able to adopt a wider view. In researching European medicine and medical science, we should begin by assuming the separate dynamics of practice, teaching and research. Each can have its own 'political economy'; they will be linked in ways that vary over time and especially between countries. To map these complex patterns, even for nineteenth-century Europe, will be far from simple, but we ought to be able to do it. Other- wise, we continue to keep implicit the major features behind each national history. Our 'common European home' needs this kind of mapping-work enough, one may suspect, for our present millennium. JOHN V.
