<plain_text><page sequence="1">Religion in Economics; A Study of John Bates Clark, Richard T. Ely, Simon N. Patten. By John Rutherford Everett. New York:. King's Crown Press, 1946. Pp. xiii, i6o. $2.50. Working on the assumption that economic thought can be adequately under- stood only within the framework of the individual writer's total philosophy, Mr. Everett has undertaken a study of the religious and philosophical ideas expressed in the works of Clark, Ely, and Patten. The choice of these three men was indeed fortunate, for they were all thinkers deeply concerned with problems relating to the fundamental nature of man, his purpose and his destiny. They believed that the problems of America were basically spiritual rather than eco- nomic. All three came from homes steeped in the Puritan theology, and while each in his way discarded a great part of the traditional dogma they were convinced that Christianity offered the soundest and most rational foundation for society. Clark's and Ely's fundamental theological concept was the father- hood of God and consequently the brotherhood of man. Patten rejected the traditional idea of an anthropomorphic God and considered God to be the sum total of all man's ideals and hopes. But all agreed that a religious conversion was fundamental to economic reform. Once man had been converted, he was stripped of the vices of avarice and selfishness. In this connection, it is interesting to note that Patten decried the common theological belief in an individual and personal conversion, and preached the necessity of social conversion that would place the emphasis on the salvation of society rather than of the individual. Only after conversion had been achieved was it possible for society to evolve to the desired goal, the Kingdom of God on earth. But the three disagreed on the source of the principles that would guide man after conversion: Clark saw man as moving within the framework of the eternal natural laws; Ely believed man to be guided by an internal moral law which blossomed forth under the touch of spiritual conversion; while Patten regarded man in society as being controlled by certain pragmatic rules adapted to his environment and problems. There is no doubt that the economic thought of Clark, Ely, and Patten was greatly influenced by their religious beliefs. Clark and Ely regarded competition as wholesome-when it was tempered by the Christian code of conduct and its hierarchy of values. Competition, for Patten, ran counter to his ideas on compro- mise and co-operation and was therefore rejected. The institution of private property was supported by Clark and Ely on the basis of the theological argu- ment that God gave man after the fall the right to all he could wrest from Nature and could create. Both further agreed that man holds his property in trust and is responsible to God and society for his stewardship. Patten spoke little on the subject of property; once the co-operative principle was established</page><page sequence="2">History of Economic Thought 269 as the controlling force in society, property distinctions would become unim- portant. While Patten and Ely favored government planning, Clark was unable to conceive of government as having any positive social function. Patten was convinced that, once religious regeneration had eradicated selfishness, the planners would work for the mutual benefit of the people. Ely shared this view, but in addition considered true government as being exercised in conformity with God's will, and therefore capable of achieving only good. This essay is well written and the exposition is closely integrated. It is unforl tunate that Mr. Everett has circumscribed his task so as to exclude fuller criticism of the ideas presented by Clark, Ely, and Patten. In the last few pages the author does sketch in a short criticism of their social and economic ideas, but this treat- ment is too brief to be adequate. However, Mr Everett has done an excellent job within the limitations he has set himself, and has made a real contribution to literature in the field of American intellectual history.
