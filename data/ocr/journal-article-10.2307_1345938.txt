There was a Boy: ye knew him well, ye cliffs And islands of Winander!-many a time At evening, when the earliest stars began To move along the edges of the hills, Rising or setting, would he stand alone Beneath the trees or by the glimmering lake, And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands Pressed closely palm to palm, and to his mouth Uplifted, he, as through an instrument, Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls, That they might answer him; and they would shout Across the watery vale, and shout again, Responsive to his call, with quivering peals, And long halloos and screams, and echoes loud, Redoubled and redoubled, concourse wild Of jocund din; and, when a lengthened pause Of silence came and baffled his best skill, Then sometimes, in that silence while he hung Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise Has carried far into his heart the voice Of mountain torrents; or the visible scene Would enter unawares into his mind, With all its solemn imagery, its rocks, Its woods, and that uncertain heaven, received Into the bosom of the steady lake. William Wordsworth, The Prelude, V, 364-87.

Woolf poses these questions com-</page><page sequence="2">258 NOVEL I SPRING 1991 plexly in her late essay "Anon" when, as her example of poetry by an anony- mous voice, she cites the following: By a bank as I lay Musing myself alone, hey ho! A birdes voice Did me rejoice, Singing before the day; And me thought in her lay She said, winter was past, hey ho!1 Imagining a primordial inhabitant of the British forest, Woolf asks: "Did the desire to sing come to one of those huntsmen because he heard the birds sing?" But the song she quotes suggests that the desire had more components, that the song-writing impulse also includes a desire to respond to the bird-song, which immediately demands that that bird-song include a message to respond to. Such a message is then projected onto the bird's sounds, more on our than on its behalf, so much do we want to believe that a voice always constitutes a response, that silence alone "baffles" us. Thus it is with the narrator of The Prelude, so concerned to have us believe in the owls as responsive, and not baffling in their own right, that he must have us wonder not at their sounds but at their silence--a silence immediately filled by "the voice/Of mountain torrents," and filled further by the Boy's perception of "the visible scene." Just as the owls' cries were not meaningless sound, so this scene is not merely a sight, but "solemn imagery"-imagery itself capable of a self-affirming specular relationship, as the "uncertain heaven" is "received/Into the bosom of the steady lake." Such a flurry of anthropomorphic identifications suggests that even natural noises such as bird calls carry high epistemological stakes. These stakes are present in The Years from its opening page: In the quieter streets musicians doled out their frail and for the most part me- lancholy pipe of sound, which was echoed, or parodied, here in the trees of Hyde Park, here in St. James's by the twitter of sparrows and the sudden out- bursts of the amorous but intermittent thrush. The pigeons in the squares shuf- fled in the tree tops, letting fall a twig or two, and crooned over and over again the lullaby that was always interrupted.2 Who has priority, humans or birds, as regards shuffling, crooning, twittering, echoing or parodying? But before we even get that far, the more urgent, if hid- den question is this: why do we assume the birds are citing us, imitating our be- Brenda R.

The question of birds and citations is most dizzyingly raised in The Years when Edward and Kitty are walking together in the park, hear a thrush, and Edward quotes Browning. The need for mere responsiveness here meets the need for acknowledgement of cultural prowess and priority in interesting ways. In the novel, Kitty describes this episode to a friend at a dinner party (Y 261), but in the proofs for the novel we can read the episode itself. The two are in Richmond Park, and something Edward says makes Kitty fear he is going to re- peat the proposal of marriage he had made to her many years earlier: A spasm of fear came over her, absurd though it was. No, no, no, she said to herself. No, no, no. And then, just as she used to do when she wished to brush aside something that was too emotional, she changed the conversation. "There's my cuckoo!" she exclaimed. She stopped and pretended to listen. He stopped too. A bird was singing, but it was not a cuckoo. "That's the wise thrush," he said, "that sings each song twice over." He spoke quite unconcernedly. She was relieved, but at the same time ashamed of her folly. "Does a thrush sing its song twice over?" she asked. "So the poet says," he observed. It was a quotation and she had not recog- nised it. He always made her feel such a boor. That's why I didn't marry you, she said to herself, glancing sideways at his distinguished face-but his eyes were a little near together. Always saying what somebody else had said, she thought.3 Kitty assumes she understands the tenor of Edward's remarks leading up to this exchange: "There was some emotion in his voice.... could it be ... that he was about to ask her to marry him again?" But her projection of meaning onto Edward's song fails; she misreads him; his next remark shows him to be "unconcerned." In her bafflement, Kitty is both relieved and ashamed of her selfish imaginings. She is then baffled again by her failure to recognize a quo- tation. The pique which results from these two bafflements finds expression in her cutting observations about his features and his almost thrushlike lack of originality. But there is another possible story here. Dare we go a bit further and suggest that perhaps Kitty had recognized Edward's song? The evidence would come from our ability to cite the surrounding text in Browning, and thus identify the thrush as someone trying to find an easy cover for his belatedness: ... he sings each song twice over, Lest you should think he never could recapture The first fine careless rapture! 3 Grace Radin, Virginia Woolfs "The Years": The Evolution of a Novel (Knoxville: The University of Tennessee Press, 1981) 168- 69. Hereafter cited parenthetically as Radin.</page><page sequence="4">260 NOVEL I SPRING 1991 On this reading, Kitty's mistake is in believing in Edward's front of "unconcern", for our erudition, and his own, suggest that he is concerned with his relation to his amorous past, and concerned somehow to cover for his failures. But is it fair to interpret this far, fair to Kitty, for example? For this scene is also about the oppressive weight of this poetic citation, a citation whose quota- tion marks Kitty failed to perceive, preoccupied as she was with the tone of "unconcern" in Edward's voice. As we perceive (even if belatedly) the presence of the quotation marks, we might well enter into a specular relation with Edward and his learning, repeating for him the violence by which he confirms his erudition, the quiet putting in place of an uneducated woman, the baffe given to Kitty's own self-esteem: just as, when we read things her way, we might share her own specular stab back at Edward's looks and his intellectual origi- nality.4 In reading Kitty and Edward for intentions, we repeat the gesture of that anonymous song-writer who so wanted to hear meaningful words in a simple song. Repetition, citation, the assigning of interiority in a gesture of projection, such acts carry their dangers; but what alternatives have we when it comes to reacting to the sights and sounds around us? In a study of repetition in Woolf's work, Allen McLaurin suggests that she uses two kinds of repetition: "repetition can be either comforting or terrifying, organic or mechanical, boring or rhythmi- cal depending on our point of view."5 Comforting, organic, and rhythmical would seem to belong together, in opposition to terrifying, mechanical and bor- ing. In practice, the two series seem rather to become indistinguishable. What we have just seen is that it is perhaps terror which underlies the insistent belief in the meaningfulness of "organic" repetition, and what we may soon see is that, in fact, mechanical repetition, even where initially defensively feared, might have its good side. Indeed, McLaurin admits, perhaps inadvertently, a bit later on that organic and mechanical forms of repetition are not so easily separable: "We can see from her [Woolf's] diary that the parrot is a personal symbol for the mechanical and horrifying aspect of repetition.... The parrot simply imitates noises, there is no real communication."6 Animal and machine become confused as "organic" creatures perform inorganic or mechanical repeti- tions. And indeed, if we look to The Years for examples of mechanical repetition, we can find them in a pair of perfectly organic children, Maggie and Sara. 4 See, on these issues, Neil Hertz's helpful essay, "Two Extravagant Teachings," The End of the Line: Essays on Psychoanalysis and the Sublime (New York: Columbia University Press, 1985) 144-59, especially his comments on Wasserman's reading of The Rape of the Lock. For example (153): "the question of how far an interpreter should go is obviously inseparable from the question of the interpreter's own erudition: one needs to know the texts Pope was alluding to in order to spot an allusion in the first place.... Both the occasion that initiates an interpretative process and the restraints regulating it are functions of one's learning." These functions which determine which scenes become our scenes of interpretation, I suppose I could add, are multi-variable ones, not varying only with one's "erudition" or "learning"-difficult words in their own right-but also perhaps with other kinds of obsessions which even such noble words cannot cover. I might also add, in my own self-defense, that I looked up "thrush" in a dictionary of quotations in order to find the source of Edward's citation. 5 Allen McLaurin, Virginia Woolf: The Echoes Enslaved (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1973) 131. 6 McLaurin, 171, emphasis added.</page><page sequence="5">MICHAEL LUCEY I DISCONCERTING VOICES 261 Abel Pargiter brings his niece Maggie a hurriedly bought and rather cheap necklace as a birthday present. Maggie opens the gift, and looks at it in silence. Trouble looms, and so her mother intervenes: "Thank Uncle Abel for the lovely necklace," her mother prompted her. "Thank you for the necklace, Uncle Abel," said Maggie. She spoke directly and accurately, but the Colonel felt another twinge of doubt. A pang of disap- pointment out of all proportion to its object came over him. (Y 121-22) Maggie is citing her mother, as an actor follows the hidden prompter's lead. "You" is the only word she needs to add on her own. But the fact that she fails to imitate the word "lovely" might lead us towards an intention. Maggie is a savvy child. She knows the game of specularity and lets her uncle know she knows it but isn't playing it with him. She repeats, mechanically, directly, ac- curately. No participation, for her, in the pretenses which keep us together. Perhaps more intriguing is the case of her sister, Sara. In Sara's case, it is Abel who doesn't want to be drawn into a relationship of identification. Her mother invites her to say hello to her uncle: She held out her hand partly to coax the little girl, partly, Abel guessed, in order to conceal the very slight deformity that always made him uncomfort- able. She had been dropped when she was a baby; one shoulder was slightly higher than the other; it made him feel squeamish; he could not bear the least deformity in a child. It did not affect her spirits, however. She skipped up to him, whirling round on her toe, and kissed him lightly on the cheek. (Y 122) Missing a few fingers himself, Abel prefers that deformity remain a privilege of adulthood, and that he not find himself forced to reflect on it by the presence of a child, a presence meant to be reassuring. Sara, uncanny from the start, does not speak to her uncle, even though told by her mother to "come and say how- d'you-do." And when we do hear her speak for the first time, in response to her father, what we encounter is her startling ability to disconcert through cita- tion. Digby, the father of the two girls, comes home and finds Sara's dress to be dirty. The two girls had been playing outside round a bonfire; Digby is dis- pleased: "It's Maggie's birthday," said Eugenie, holding out her arm again as if to pro- tect the little girl. "That is a reason, I should have thought," said Sir Digby, surveying his daughters, "to-er-to-er-reform one's habits." He stumbled, trying to make his sentence sound playful; but it turned out as it generally did when he talked to the children, lame and rather pompous. Sara looked at her father as if she were considering him.</page><page sequence="6">262 NOVEL I SPRING 1991 "To-er-to-er-reform one's habits," she repeated. Emptied of all meaning, she had got the rhythm of his words exactly. The effect was somehow comic. The Colonel laughed; but Digby, he felt, was annoyed. (Y 127) Faced with his deformed child, Digby interiorizes the deformity (as Abel was trying not to), stumbling over his words, speaking lamely. Sara, on the other hand, shows no signs of interiorization at all. She looks at her father only "as if" she were considering him, and it is clear that she is involved in a different kind of consideration altogether. Her parroting of his words is not necessarily an example of horrifying, mechanical repetition, but hints at a way that mere mimicking of sounds might liberate her from the violence of specular relations, might relieve the burden of too much dependence on the vision of others. The comic effect produced, the laughter, is, as laughter often is, a sign of the threatened dissolution of a constructed self.7 Although we are doing our best to read Sara, her father's discomfort arises from the fact that he cannot, seeing in her, as he does, only some kind of absence. Another moment of this kind arises late in the novel, where Sara's brand of repetition is linked both to acting (we have already seen the way Eugenie acts as a prompter to her daughters) and to criticism. North is listening to a conver- sation between Eleanor and Edward. Eleanor is asking Edward to help her porter's son to gain admission to college: "Of course, of course," said Edward kindly. And that's all right, North said to himself. That's the human voice at its natural speaking level. Of course, of course, he repeated. "He wants to go to college, does he?" Edward went on. "What examinations has he passed, eh?" What examinations has he passed, eh? North repeated. He repeated that too, but critically, as if he were actor and critic; he listened but he commented. (Y 411) This scene is complicated by the fact that we already share North's interiority with him, something that is almost never the case with Sara, whom we usu- ally only see talking.8 North is, in this passage, and throughout the ending to 7 Marie DiBattista discusses another instance of laughter in The Years (389-90), and (in Virginia Woolfs Major Novels [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1980] 10-12) relates Woolfian laughter to Baudelaire's "De l'essence du rire." DiBattista comments: "The final, strange effect of Woolfian laughter is the enlargement, assimilation, and transfiguration of reality that occurs whenever the mind half perceives and half creates a legitimate human world that is whole, vast, and free" (my emphasis). This is an interesting possibility, though one would have to ask why the person who laughs in the scene DiBattista is discussing, Peggy, having been enlarged and relaxed, having laughed in this wholesome way, then immediately turns on her brother North and attacks him for the things she imagines him doing in the future. "A feeling of animosity possessed her" (Y 390). I will be examining this connection between theoretically wholesome enlargement and animosity in what follows. Here it is enough to say that Sara's laughter has little to do with legitimacy, except, perhaps, to deny it. 8 Grace Radin comments on this in her helpful study, Virginia Woolf s "The Years": The Evolution of a Novel (op. cit.), which also reprints excerpts which Woolf cut from the proofs in order to shorten the novel. Radin remarks (63-64): "In both the holograph and the novel after the '1907' chapter, she [Sara] is presented objectively, through the eyes and ears of others. In this way The Years is very different from Woolf's earlier novels, where a nonrational visionary perspective is present throughout in the thoughts, dreams, and hallucinations of characters.... Because Sara is allowed such a limited role in The Years, Woolf's imaginative freedom is given less play." One can easily quibble with the last sentence, since our lack of access to Sara's mind may in fact be quite central to the novel. Other critics have also commented on Sara's importance</page><page sequence="7">MICHAEL LUCEY I DISCONCERTING VOICES 263 the novel, trying to become a novelist, trying to imagine in what the novelist's act consists: how it participates in human consciousness (if it does), how it records the sounds which fill the world. Will or could North remain on the level of sound, or will he try to use sound as a way to break into the human psy- che? The passage suggests he is trying to do both. While listening to the conver- sation between Eleanor and Edward, he suddenly has this wild fantasy: He felt that he had been in the middle of a jungle; in the heart of darkness; cut- ting his way towards the light; but provided only with broken sentences, single words, with which to break through the briarbush of human bodies, human wills and voices, that bent over him, binding him, blinding him.... He lis- tened. (Y 411) North is trying to move from mere sound to communion while escaping a passage through violence; he is trying to find a non-violent volition that will allow bodies and voices to come together without binding and blinding. To unbind and unblind himself he seems to need to use the phonic parts of language, not the semantic parts. He approves Edward's "Of course, of course," not out of any shared ideology, but because it sounds, typically, naturally, like a human voice. This passage through sound to a new non-violent mode of communication calls to mind the constant Woolfian fantasy of an anonymous utopia, and North invokes this fantasy explicitly: Why not down barriers and simplify? But a world, he thought, that was all one jelly, one mass, would be a rice pudding world.... To keep the emblems and tokens of North Pargiter ... but at the same time spread out, make a new ripple in human consciousness, be the bubble and the stream, the stream and the bubble-myself and the world together-he raised his glass. Anonymously, he said, looking at the clear yellow liquid.... There was the glass in his hand; in his mind a sentence. And he wanted to make other sen- tences. But how can I, he thought-he looked at Eleanor, who sat with a silk handkerchief in her hands-unless I know what's solid, what's true; in my life, in other people's lives? (Y 410) The Years is one of the places in Woolf's work where the value of anonymous fu- sion is subjected to a scrutiny severe enough to call it into question and even to indict it as a dangerous political stance. Dangerous, not because it involves a withdrawal from some scene of action, but because to achieve a fused anonymity, to arrive at that place, one must intersect (violently) with others (we have seen a similar violence between Edward and Kitty), though having achieved anonymity, one naturally works to forget any such violent moment in the process. In the citation at hand, North holds up a glass full of liquid, a typ- ical symbol, in Woolf, of a successfully integrated self. But to achieve, affirm and express that self, North must cross a bridge from the sentence in his mind to within the novel. See, for example, Alice van Buren Kelley, The Novels of Virginia Woolf: Fact and Vision (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1973) 214 ff.</page><page sequence="8">264 NOVEL I SPRING 1991 the glass in his hand. The semi-colon between them marks a large abyss. North's desire is to make more sentences, easy enough to do perhaps when you have one already. But for assurance that that production will form a bridge, he looks to Eleanor as someone he would need to know. But how, precisely, will he use her, how will he gain the necessary knowledge from her, to make that bridge? Throughout The Years, many characters will experiment with the two forms of citation I have sketched out here: one which acknowledges or appropriates or responds to an other (like Browning) in an attempt to affirm, to firm up, the self, another which is more ascetic, striving to listen and repeat. Through the first, one can struggle for community, as North hopes to do, a possibility we will examine in more detail below; but one can also violently exclude from the com- munity, as was done to Kitty by Edward and Browning. Through the second, Sara's mimicry, there can, it would seem, be no communion, but nor does one do violence to others in self-defense. I will be tracing the struggles within and be- tween these two possibilities in what follows. I want to continue to look at Woolf's attempts to find ways of creating pastoral domains in which a charac- ter could realize itself, and her simultaneous desire to exclude violent selves. We will find, I think, that violence, for Woolf, seems inevitably to lurk at the heart of every pastoral domain, no matter how anonymously peaceful it seems. This observation might then lead us to examine the questioning of both charac- ter and aesthetics which is crucial to The Years. II. What am I? I ask. This? No, I am that.... they are now undoubtedly dis- cussing me, saying I escape them, am evasive. They do not understand that I have to effect different transitions; have to cover the entrances and exits of sev- eral different men who alternately act their parts as Bernard. I am abnormally aware of circumstances. I can never read a book in a railway carriage without asking, Is he a builder? Is she unhappy? ... But you understand, you my self, who always comes at a call (that would be a harrowing experience to call and for no one to come; that would make the midnight hollow, and explains the ex- pression of old men in clubs-they have given up calling for a self who does not come), you understand that I am only superficially represented by what I was saying tonight. Underneath, and, at the moment when I am most disparate, I am also integrated.9 The struggle towards a coherent self in Woolf, even when successful, and no matter how private the location in which it happens, is never a struggle in- volving only one self. Descriptions of such moments inevitably contain a great deal of social allegory, as is hinted at in the odd presence of the train carriage in Bernard's questioning above. (We will be looking at more train carriages, or omnibuses-and the reading that, for Woolf, always goes on there-in what Virginia Woolf, The Waves (London: Granada, 1977) 51-52.</page><page sequence="9">MICHAEL LUCEY I DISCONCERTING VOICES 265 follows.) Bernard's coming into himself is an odd mix of inclusions and exclu- sions. "They," the people who might be talking about him, are conscientiously left out, as are certain old men in clubs, while his fellow train travellers, and the mysterious "you," are brought in to achieve the completion. If we take part of the quotation out of context, and read it on its own-"that would be a harrow- ing experience to call and for no one to come; that would make the midnight hollow, and explains the expression of old men in clubs"-we come across an- other odd social presence, for these words suggest that what is being called for is, in fact, not a self but a servant or a waiter. This seems a strange way of link- ing a stable, conservative social order with a stable psychic self, a connection we need to investigate. We might recall part of a sentence from Orlando: "these selves of which we are built up, one on top of another, as plates are piled on a waiter's hand, have attachments elsewhere, sympathies, little constitutions and rights of their own....",10 and we might therefore wonder if this "you" Bernard is calling to might not be precisely that helpfully servile waiter. Bernard's struggle to cohere, and North's in fact, are similar to those of the eponymous Orlando, and Orlando's struggle might be helpfully considered here, since it is often portrayed in much more explicitly social terms: What appeared certain ... was that the one [self] she [Orlando] needed most kept aloof, for she was, to hear her talk, changing her selves as quickly as she drove-there was a new one at every corner-as happens when, for some unaccountable reason, the conscious self, which is the uppermost, and has the power to desire, wishes to be nothing but one self. This is what some people call the true self, and it is, they say, compact of all the selves we have it in us to be; commanded and locked up by the Captain self, the Key self, which amalga- mates and controls them all. Orlando was certainly seeking this self as the reader can judge from overhearing her talk as she drove.... (O 310) We have here a conscious self, a true self, and a Captain/Key self, and we have a vocabulary which suggests either an accountant organizing a hostile take- over or a benevolent tyrant setting up a federation between his or her quarrel- some dependent states. All of these figures for the desire to account for oneself, to count up one's selves, even to give them all their due, suggest that this unity, if imposed, might only be a front for a rather more frightening figural disorder, an effort to contain a revolution in which locks would be burst open, compacts would be dissolved, and voices would become incomprehensible. When, a few pages later, Orlando does actually find herself, the question of voices becomes even more important: And it was at this moment, when she had ceased to call "Orlando" and was deep in thoughts of something else that the Orlando whom she had called came of its own accord.... The whole of her darkened and settled, as when some foil 10 Virginia Woolf, Orlando: A Biography (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1928) 308, emphasis added. Hereafter referred to parenthetically as O.</page><page sequence="10">266 NOVEL I SPRING 1991 whose addition makes the round and solidity of a surface is added to it, and the shallow becomes deep and the near distant; and all is contained as water is contained by the sides of a well. So she was now darkened, stilled, and become, with the addition of this Orlando, what is called, rightly or wrongly, a single self, a real self. And she fell silent. For it is probable that when people talk aloud, the selves (of which there may be more than two thousand) are con- scious of disseverment, and are trying to communicate but when communica- tion is established there is nothing more to be said. (0 313-14, emphasis added) One could read this either as a beautiful silence or as a political curfew. Many of its elements we have seen before. The image of the well, for example, is kin to the glass North held in his hand, but no bridge of words is going to cross to this well, precisely because if and when communication is established (a door opened to a room), when a social order becomes balanced, words are no longer needed. Words, in fact, are signs of "disseverment," cracks in a well (though not, it appears, doors in a wall). "When people talk aloud, the selves,"- nowhere is it clearer the projection and introjection necessary to posit a self, the forced correspondence between outer people and inner selves, between outer and inner stability-"are conscious of disseverment," a social disseverment felt most acutely within an individual psyche. The difficulties of this passage from Orlando are only added to by the image of the "foil," a tool whose addition artificially produces the illusions of depth and distance, the mirroring sheet which brings the outside in, makes a social condition a mental structure. If we look to the OED for definitions of foil, its supplementary role becomes even more painfully clear: "Anything that serves by contrast of colour or quality to adorn another thing or set it off to advan- tage"; "A thin leaf of some metal placed under a precious stone to increase its brilliancy or under some transparent substance to give it the appearance of a precious stone." The OED even gives a citation which suggests the potential vi- olence in its use: "when a pretty woman chooses to appear in public with a homely one, we say she uses her as a foil." These descriptions of the self are most revealing in their willingness to dis- play their contradictions-contradictions, say, between a foil on the one hand, and water contained in a well on the other. The walls and water suggest pre- cisely integrity and a hoped-for impermeability, whereas the foil suggests that internality is only an illusion created by the reflection of an outer world, dependent on that outer world to establish its own individuality. We might also notice a similar-though here clearly more tenuous-difference between the images from Orlando of a placid waiter holding a stack of plates on his hand (holding them, one hopes, as securely and subserviently as a well holds water) and a "Captain self ... which amalgamates them all." For a waiter is precisely there to come when he is called, whereas this captain seems to have a different contract (or "compact") than the other selves. He commands them and locks them up, but needn't himself come when called. He is as flashy as a piece of foil, it seems, and as fickle to boot. For this particular Key self comes</page><page sequence="11">MICHAEL LUCEY I DISCONCERTING VOICES 267 "of its own accord," as if it were above the law, not bound by any conventions we know. We have here, then, two images for the same moment of coalescence, one ex- plicitly authoritarian and perhaps even illusory, one which aims to be purely pastoral. We will observe a similar confusion of violence and the pastoral, within Woolf's discourse, in the struggle of the poet or writer with her or his audience, in the movement from anonymity to individuality, or in the move- ments from one set of literary conventions to another. We have more evidence here, then, of the way personal struggles and social struggles are, in Woolf, so often couched in identical terms, more evidence of this link between inner and outer worlds. Let us first examine that paradigmatic moment in literary his- tory, when the anonymous voice of the poet is struggling to achieve individual existence: But at some point there comes a break when anonymity withdraws. Does it come when the playwright had absorbed the contribution of the audience; and can return to them their own general life individualised in single and separate figures? There comes a point when the audience is no longer master of the play- wright. Yet he is not separate from them. A common life still unites them; but there are moments of separation. Now we say, he is speaking our own thoughts. Now he is our selves. But this sense of individuality comes fitfully. The beauty which is so astonishingly revealed, is often a suspended derelict ir- relevant beauty. There is no sequence. It does not connect; the parts are severed, and something runs to waste. For the anonymous playwright is irresponsible. He flouts truth at the bidding of the audience. he [sic] cares only for the plot. We are left in the end without an end. The emotion is wasted. (Anon 398) This passage is filled with familiar elements, even familiar contradictions. First of all, we can remark how similar this non-anonymous poet is going to be to the Captain self. Once he achieves his mastery, things will no longer be "severed," things will no longer "run to waste." The walls of the well will hold their water. We notice, too, that he will have his own compact, will no longer be at the bid and call of the audience; he will be, as North hopes to be, respon- sible only to some higher truth. We also note in this passage the low esteem in which plot is held. Let us take a diversion of a few pages to investigate this issue, hoping that our waiter's hand is steady enough not to sever the substance of our argument. Woolf is well known to have eschewed plot in favor of character, most fa- mously in her essay "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown." A reading of both The Years and "Anon" might, however, convince us that this decision was not one Woolf was entirely comfortable with; it was a decision whose ideological conse- quences she kept turning over. In one of the drafts for "Anon," she sounds quite happy with the decision, one which comes about with the withdrawal of Anon: "But by degrees the dramatist sheds his anonymity. He separates himself from his audience. He pauses, sometimes; he diverts the interest from the action to the motive behind the action" (Anon 423). To make this move, cross this bridge,</page><page sequence="12">268 NOVEL I SPRING 1991 from plot to character, action to motive, we, of course, use a foil, we move in- side, a move we can make, says Woolf, precisely once the audience has been "mastered": But gradually the audience is mastered by the playwright.... The individual on the stage becomes more and more differentiated; and the whole group is more closely related and less at the mercy of the plot.... [T]he play has outgrown the uncovered theatre where the sun beats and the rain pours. That theatre must be replaced by the theatre of the brain. (Anon 398) But this housetraining is never entirely successful. We continue to long for plot, and the power of plot remains, for Woolf, figured in the imagination of a child: But anonymity is a great possession.... Nor is anon dead in ourselves. The crude early dramas still have the power to make us ask-as the audience asked-the childs [sic] question: what comes next? ... It is only later when the pressure of silent hoarded emotion had thrown up words, as the fingers of the man at the monotype machine cast letters from the bubbling lead, that we lost this general quality to gain-everything it seems. (Anon 424) The poignant pathos of that final phrase, the nostalgia for childhood, and the strange association of the world of character with the dehumanized, metallic mass production of print all combine to suggest the power of the alternate sce- nario of an artisanal child willing to forego the depths of character analysis for the pleasurable superficiality of plot. If we turn again to The Years, we can find these two scenarios embodied in a way which parallels the two methods of citation we examined earlier. The gesture towards strengthening the self by reaching out to the other can be ac- complished by a reading, sympathetic or otherwise, of another's character. The interest in plot, on the other hand, finds its childlike voice in Sara, the embod- iment of mimicry, the one who speaks without projecting herself. "Tell us that story, Mama" (Y 143), she asks early on, and will repeat that question many times in the course of the novel. Let us look at the scene where Rose comes to lunch in Maggie's and Sara's flat. They are reminiscing about Rose's old house at Abercorn Terrace, and Maggie inquires about the servant: "And you had a parlourmaid with very prominent blue eyes?" "Crosby. She's still with us." They ate in silence. "And then?" said Sara, as if she were a child asking for a story. "And then?" said Rose. "Well, then"-she looked at Maggie, thinking of her as a little girl who had come to tea.... And she saw Eleanor sitting with her account books; and she saw herself go up to her and say: "Eleanor, I want to go to Lamley's" . They talked, she thought, as if Abercorn Terrace were a scene in a play. They talked as if they were speaking of people who were real, but not real in the way</page><page sequence="13">MICHAEL LUCEY I DISCONCERTING VOICES 269 in which she felt herself to be real. It puzzled her; it made her feel that she was two different people at the same time; that she was living at two different times at the same moment. (Y 166-67) Sara has the same effect whether she mimics someone, or asks for a story. Wholes are not created; wells are not filled; rather the self is baffled, puzzled, left less secure. That there could be benefits to this effect is intriguingly sug- gested by Rose's fleeting memory of her childhood trip to Lamley's, the trip during which an exhibitionist unbuttoned his trousers in front of her. Throughout the book, this is presented as an episode whose trauma most strongly shaped her character. Here it seems to be suggested that had she been able to make that trauma into a story, to tell it, to plot it, it might not have embedded itself so deeply. A successful plot, the novel seems to suggest, could free us from the pain of not speaking of how our character has been shaped. In another of the episodes Woolf cut from the final version of the novel, we once again come upon reflections on the nature of plot. Here the question raises more clearly political ambivalences. It is Eleanor in this episode, who has been to see a mystery play with Miriam Parrish, and is troubled by her involvement with the plot. Miriam comments, as they leave the theatre, "And I never guessed how it was going to end-did you?" "No," said Eleanor. "I never guessed. It took me quite by surprise." Until five minutes of the end, she had believed that the innocent man was the villain. She stood still for a moment; she was still under the influence of the play. She had to readjust all her ideas. She had been completely taken in. "I suppose one ought to have guessed," she said, thinking of the plot. "But I didn't-no." (Radin 164) Eleanor is entranced not only by her absorption in the play, but by the fact that for most of the play she was denied access to the motives of the characters. She continues to try to unravel this puzzle as she walks home alone, when suddenly a couple of passers-by add a political element to her musings, musings taking place in war-time London: It was odd, she thought, how completely she had been taken in; not until five minutes before the end had she realised-she began to go over the plot again. But a voice said behind her, "Ah, but it's not a time for picking and choos- ing...." At first she thought the words were spoken to her. She looked round. Two middle-aged men of the professional class were passing her. She stopped for a moment to let them go by. They were talking about the War; she had for- gotten the War; she had been absorbed in the play. She had a momentary feel- ing of guilt. How childish, she thought, moving on, to have been absorbed in a story, when-when what? (Radin 164) Here we find expressed all Woolf's political ambivalences of the 1930s. Should women really participate in a professional structure organized by men? Is there</page><page sequence="14">270 NOVEL I SPRING 1991 any voice within those structures sincerely addressed to women? Should Eleanor perhaps not be called back into reality, out of her absorption in her story, by that pair of male voices? Is there, for example, any political effec- tiveness to be found in the stance of an outsider like Sara?"1 Eleanor, in fact, tries to find a mid-point between Sara and professional men in her practice of philanthropy throughout the novel. Philanthropy is a form of reaching out which, set next to Edward's reaching out to Browning, strives for the non-vio- lence of the imagery of a peaceful well, an image in danger of being overshad- owed by the flashier, and more dangerous image of the foil. Our deviation into a consideration of plot and character is starting to weave its way back into something like our main argument. Eleanor's philanthropy (which, in fact, does represent a choice of character over plot) is a compensatory structure, like that of a peaceful, silent self, which attempts to cover over other closely re- lated violent structures-like a Captain indenturing his subalterns, or a foil creating an illusion of depth. In this act of compensation, the possibilities of an absorption in plot are silently derailed. The aesthetic parallel to Eleanor's social acts of philanthropy turns out to be her attempts to concoct stories as a way of reading the character of those around her in a comprehensive and sympathetic way. Thus, momentarily unable to re- solve her conflicting feelings about her involvement in the plot of the play and her forgetfulness of England's danger, she gets on an omnibus, and immediately has an imaginative encounter with "the usual woman with a child on her knee." The pattern we see here is typical of Eleanor throughout the novel: an initial negative response to this other person, immediately overruled by her imaginative effort at understanding: The woman holding the child on her knee had put her ticket in her mouth. Why take a child of that age out at this time of night? Eleanor asked herself, and she began to make up a little story to account for it-perhaps she had been visiting her husband, who was wounded, in one of the City hospitals-when the bus stopped with a jerk; the woman got up and lurched, carrying the child, down the gangway out onto the pavement. She set the child on its feet; and the bus swooped on. Perhaps she was a caretaker, Eleanor thought, trying to go on with her story: but late at night when people were too tired to talk, the little sto- ries that one made up in omnibuses were unsatisfactory. (Radin 165, empha- sis added) In the course of the development of the novel, as Grace Radin shows, many passages critiquing Sara's inevitable political ineffectuality were gradually removed. Here, for example, is Radin's description of an earlier version of the luncheon scene between Sara, Maggie, and Rose, a scene we have just been looking at: "The sisters live in social isolation and are unaware of the problems of the poor. They do not understand why people go on having children that they cannot care for, instead of going to a physician for contraceptive help, as Maggie has done. When Rose points out that poor women do not have the three guineas to pay a Harley Street physician, Elvira [the original name for the character who became Sara in the novel] proposes to write a letter to the Times, suggesting that birth control devices be made available to all.... Elvira's suggestion amazes Rose, for she realizes that Elvira does not know that it is illegal to disseminate birth control information in the England of 1910. And Elvira, in her turn, is shocked to learn that such an absurd law exists." Radin, Virginia Woolfs "The Years," 51.</page><page sequence="15">MICHAEL LUCEY I DISCONCERTING VOICES 271 This accounting, this attempt, we might say, to bring Eleanor's own self back into balance, is far from innocent. The imaginary wounded husband rises up out of Eleanor's guilt at her own forgetfulness of the war, and the possibility of the woman being a caretaker looks forward to the final scene of the novel, where Eleanor's compensatory strategies will be most taxed by a real set of caretaker's children. Is Eleanor's "story" in this passage one about which a child would want to ask: "What next?" Or is it an attempt to stabilize her own inwardness by cor- rectly citing another's inner situation? Eleanor's initial question, "Why take a child ...", is clearly one of motive. But we must admit that one of the startling achievements of Eleanor throughout the novel is her ability successfully to ar- rive at sympathy through her attempts to expand her inwardness to include new selves. Other characters, like Edward and Kitty, as we saw earlier, are not so capable of avoiding or sublimating violent reactions. Having seen Eleanor's more or less successful sympathetic attempt at reading character, an attempt parallel to the successful coherence of a self in the image of water contained in a well or champagne in a glass, let us turn to the coherence by way of foil, the attempt to read character where that act displays most clearly its violent side. I would like to examine two instances of this. One of the two instances will be from The Years, but first, I would like to turn to that most programmatic essay of Woolf's, "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown," where it is Woolf who puts herself in Eleanor's shoes, though in a train this time, and not a bus.12 III. Character is the stated topic of "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown," specifically, the struggle writers of Virginia Woolf's generation are going through in finding an adequate way of portraying it. Woolf's first move, however, is to confuse the is- sue with a pair of assertions that uses "character" not to mean an invented per- son in a novel, but the inner qualities of a human being. The second of these assertions is by now famous in Woolf criticism: My first assertion is one that I think you will grant-that every one in this room is a judge of character. Indeed it would be impossible to live for a year without disaster unless one practised character-reading and had some skill in the art.... And now I will hazard a second assertion, which is more disputable perhaps, to the effect that on or about December, 1910, human character changed.13 What would be the relationship between character-reading in this sense, and reading about a character in a novel? Woolf muddies the issue by suggesting I have found helpful discussions of the issues of this section and the next one in Rachel Bowlby's book, Virginia Woolf. Feminist Destinations (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1988). See esp. 43-44, 99-100, 127. 13 Virginia Woolf, "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown," in The Captain's Death Bed and Other Essays (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1950) 95-96. Hereafter referred to parenthetically as CDB.</page><page sequence="16">272 NOVEL I SPRING 1991 that the change in human character could be observed on the one hand in the works of Samuel Butler or Bernard Shaw, on the other in the new real-life manners of modem cooks. In both cases, according to Woolf, it is a case of gaining a working knowledge of someone else's interior motives, seeing through someone else's eyes. The difference between novelists and other people is that novelists are more obsessed with getting inside other people: I have said that people have to acquire a good deal of skill in character-reading if they are to live a single year of life without disaster. But it is the art of the young. In middle age and in old age the art is practised mostly for its uses, and friendships and other adventures and experiments in the art of reading charac- ter are seldom made. But novelists differ from the rest of the world.... The study of character becomes to them an absorbing pursuit; to impart character an obsession. And this I find it very difficult to explain: what novelists mean when they talk about character, what the impulse is that urges them so powerfully ev- ery now and then to embody their view in writing. (CDB 97) To whom do these novelists impart character, to their fictional creations, or to their readers? If reading character means being able to see the world through someone else's eyes ("some character who has seemed to you so real ... that it has the power to make you think not merely of it itself, but of all sorts of things through its eyes..." [CDB 103]), then what does it mean for a novelist to "embody" a "view"? We are back to the world of the foil which could transport us to the land of inside, confused by Woolf's refusal to distinguish between the various uses of the word "character," when suddenly Woolf makes things even more difficult for us by choosing not to continue her analysis, but instead to "tell ... a simple story ... of a journey [by train] from Richmond to Waterloo." Now this train car- riage Woolf jumps into is a container rather like a glass or a well or a brain, and we can read the story Woolf tells us according to two paradigms we have al- ready encountered: Orlando's struggle to master herself, or the poet's struggle to break from the Anon voice, and master the audience. As Woolf seats herself in the carriage, she imagines a series of facts about the two other people in the carriage, whose conversation she has just interrupted: All this shot through my mind as I sat down, being uncomfortable, like most people, at travelling with fellow passengers unless I have somehow or other ac- counted for them. (CDB 98, emphasis added) This question of accounting, of motivating another's presence, came up not only in Eleanor's story about the woman on the bus, but in Orlando's effort to explain the "unaccountable" presence or absence of her Captain self, and in her narra- tor's consistent efforts to number Orlando's selves. But it is not only Mrs. Brown who needs accounting for. This train carriage is crowded with an audience of readers, as well. Here is where the struggle of the non-anonymous poet for mas- tery returns to the scene. For this particular reading audience is fascinated by</page><page sequence="17">MICHAEL LUCEY I DISCONCERTING VOICES 273 Victorian ways of writing, and thus needs forcibly to be brought into the order of the Georgian writer's mind, in order to see the new kind of character: A writer is never alone. There is always the public with him-if not on the same seat, at least in the compartment next door. Now the public is a strange travelling companion.... sitting by the writer's side and saying in its vast and unanimous way: "Old women have houses. They have fathers. They have in- comes. They have servants. They have hot-water bottles. That is how we know that they are old women...." The Georgian novelist, therefore, was in an awkward predicament. There was Mrs. Brown protesting that she was different, quite different, from what people made out, and luring the novelist to her rescue by the most fascinating if fleeting glimpse of her charms-and there was the British public asseverating that they must see the hot-water bottle first. (CDB 113-14) Victorian conventions are precisely the "foil" Mrs. Brown uses to set off her "charms" to advantage, and to lure the artist away from the serious demands of the audience that she sever the whole which is Mrs. Brown, leaving behind only her most quotidian accoutrements, allowing her true "character" to run to waste. For all its good natured tone, "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown" has some rather nefarious designs on its reader. These designs were, in fact, hidden in that open- ing pair of assertions: that everyone in the room is a judge of character, but that character has changed, thus undercutting our naive faith, as mere readers, in our ability to judge it, necessitating a new authorial intervention. "[T]hese selves of which we are built up ... have attachments elsewhere, sympathies, little constitutions and rights of their own ..." (O 308), we remember, but they can all be compacted, contracted, amalgamated, locked up, by a Captain self operating "of its own accord," and operating with some force. That Captain self seems most likely here to be the writer, dictating the terms of the new contract. Whenever Woolf puts herself in an imagined relation to her audience, psy- chic violence is close at hand. Notice how, as Woolf describes the current con- tract negotiations between author and audience, the current period of self-sta- bilization, she slightly displaces the violence: At the present moment we are suffering ... from having no code of manners which writers and readers accept as a prelude to the more exciting intercourse of friendship. The literary convention of the time is so artificial ... that, naturally, the feeble are tempted to outrage, and the strong are led to destroy the very foundations and rules of literary society.... Grammar is violated; syntax disin- tegrated; as a boy staying with an aunt for the week-end rolls in the geranium bed out of sheer desperation as the solemnities of the sabbath wear on. The more adult writers do not, of course, indulge in such wanton exhibitions of spleen. (CDB 115-16)</page><page sequence="18">274 NOVEL I SPRING 1991 Displaced from unruly audiences of the kind that ride in third-class train car- riages onto spoiled, rich, angry young boys, and second-rate, sexually suspect ("wanton") splenetic writers, the violence, as it runs its course, finds itself being inflicted on prose itself, on grammar and syntax. The most sexually explicit moment in this violent chain comes just before the essay closes. Here, Woolf has apparently almost won over, mastered this audience, and she imagines what she and other writers will have been saved from by ending their severed rela- tions with their readers, by building solid containing walls around their wells: May I end by venturing to remind you of the duties and responsibilities that are yours as partners in this business of writing books, as companions in the rail- way carriage, as fellow travellers with Mrs. Brown? For she is just as visible to you who remain silent as to us who tell stories about her.... Nevertheless, you allow the writers to palm off upon you a version of all this, an image of Mrs. Brown, which has no likeness to that surprising apparition whatsoever.... Never was there a more fatal mistake. It is this division between reader and writer, this humility on your part, these professional airs and graces on ours, that corrupt and emasculate the books which should be the healthy off- spring of a close and equal alliance between us. (CDB 118-19, emphasis added) It has been part of the argument of this article that the liberal gesture of inclu- sion enacted in the first sentence of this citation, with its concomitant subse- quent moments of psychic violence, this scenario which arises every time a per- son projects motives onto someone else, every time someone reads a character, every time an author imagines an audience, is subject to a great deal more criti- cal scrutiny in The Years than in the other texts we have been looking at. Sara's very presence in the novel is evidence of this new questioning, as is, I shall ar- gue, the odd presence of the incomprehensible song at the close of the novel, as is the moment I want to look at now, where North reenacts the pattern we have just seen in "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown": an initial movement of sympathetic inclusion towards a certain character or characters (usually a potential subject for a work of art), followed by a moment of violent exclusion of others (usually the potential audience).14 North is talking to Eleanor, but suddenly his attention wanders to a couple he sees standing across the room. The romantic landscape he creates could per- haps be taken as the alter ego of the "heart of darkness" we saw him imagining earlier: They were standing by the fireplace. Both were young; both were silent; they seemed held still in that position by some powerful emotion. As he looked at them, some emotion about himself, about his own life, came over him, and he arranged another background for them or for himself-not the mantelpiece 14 The structure I am tracing is very similar to what Neil Hertz refers to as an "end of the line" structure, and I have been greatly helped by his work. See The End of the Line, esp. 217-39.</page><page sequence="19">MICHAEL LUCEY I DISCONCERTING VOICES 275 and the bookcase, but cataracts roaring, clouds racing, and they stood on a cliff above a torrent.... (Y 372) The discussion North has been having with Eleanor is about marriage, and North has just commented that "everybody ought to marry," a process his fan- tasy carries out for him through the couple he takes over. Eleanor has never married, however, and breaks into his fantasy by commenting: "Marriage isn't for everyone." North recollects Eleanor's past, and then reaches out to her, still filled with the specular sympathy of his romantic fantasy: He looked at her with affection. He felt fond of everyone at the moment. "What luck to find you alone, Nell!" he said, laying his hand on her knee. She was touched; the feel of his hand on her knee pleased her. (Y 372) Touched on her knee and in her heart, a bridge from one well to another, this moment of happy communion represents the turning point of the scenario, for the shadow of sexual violence behind North's desire for union immediately asserts itself in Eleanor's mind, tainting the moment: "She felt his excitement through her dress; he was like a dog on a leash; straining forward with all his nerves erect, she felt, as he laid his hand on her knee" (Y 373). North himself displaces this violent shadow from Eleanor to her sister Milly and to Milly's husband Hugh, who intrude themselves at this moment. Eleanor could be North's muse, or a subject sitting for his novelistic imagination, but Milly, "Damn her!", could only be one of those recalcitrant, retrograde readers who might perhaps paw their way through his book briefly. The sex- ual assault is vicious: Milly, voluminous in draperies proper to her sex and class, was coming to- wards them. She had grown very stout. In order to disguise her figure, veils with beads on them hung down over her arms. They were so fat that they re- minded North of asparagus; pale asparagus tapering to a point. (Y 373) As the passage continues, and North listens to Milly's voice, his attacks will become increasingly violent, throwing further into doubt his ability ever to sus- tain a peaceful form of inclusive communication.15 As Milly talks, her words initially have the effect of sending us again to one of North's obsessional land- scapes, filled with rhyme, class animosity, and sexual insecurity: 15 Woolf is, in fact, here moving in a critical, ironic mode toward a passage from her own Diary (31 January 1920), where she, in a fashion similar to North's, vents her own spleen against a fat woman with children, a certain Mrs. Squire who was dining at the Woolfs: The middle classes are cut so thick, &amp; ring so coarse, when they laugh or express themselves.... It is said that Mr Wilkinson [another dinner guestl was nearly drunk; that excuse can't serve Mrs Squire though; she has spread more widely; is even more settled into a kind of whitish sediment; a sort of indecency to me in her passive gloating contentment in the arm chair opposite; like some natural function, performing automatically-a jelly fish-without volition, yet with terrifying potentiality. She breaks off into young on the least provocation.... (The Diary of Virginia Woolf, Vol. II: 1920-1924. Ed.

But he was in such a superfluity of high spirits that he could still make her words jingle. Did the tarantulas bite, she was asking him, and were the stars bright? And where shall I spend tomorrow night? ... They were staying with Connie, she went on, who was expecting Jimmy, who was home from Uganda ... his mind slipped a few words, for he was seeing a garden, a room, and the next word he heard was "adenoids"- which is a good word, he said to himself, separating it from its context; wasp- waisted; pinched in the middle; with a hard, shining, metallic abdomen, useful to describe the appearance of an insect.... (Y 374) The fantasy goes on for another page or so. The word adenoids seems an odd glimmer of hope, a word North can repeat and adorn Sara-fashion, moving briefly to the non-semantic, non-specular realm of phonic pleasure. But the pos- sibility of the non-specular poetry of mere sound is undercut not only by the in- sectological fantasies on which he embarks, but also by the continuing momen- tum of the sexual fantasy ("where shall I spend tomorrow night?"), and the ways the word adenoids then becomes arbitrarily linked to the sexual disgust North is channelling towards Milly: They were inviting him to stay with them at the Towers in September for cub- hunting. The men shot, and the women-he looked at his aunt as if she might be breaking into young even there, on that chair-the women broke off into innumerable babies. And those babies had other babies; and the other babies had-adenoids. The word recurred; but it now suggested noth- ing. He was sinking; he was falling under their weight.... (Y 375, emphasis added) Woolf here rewrites her own diary entry for 31 January 1920 (see footnote 14) in a way that seems to acknowledge that the hostility expressed could well arise from the desire for the kind of mastery over an audience that would permit the writer's own intimate (but nonetheless sexually charged), specular rapport with her or his subject to remain somehow aesthetically pure. Woolf's imagery up until this moment of questioning had seemed to divide neatly into two oppos- ing camps of associations: 1) classless &amp; unsophisticated audience/ plot/ potentiality/ waste/ sexual disgust/ class anger/ parturition; 2) masterful poet &amp; well-disciplined audience/ character and motive/ voli- tion/ unity/ androgynous artistic intercourse/ philanthropic, liberal sympa- thy/ aesthetic production. The Years seems to me to struggle to realize that these are two sides of the same coin, and to begin to look for a new kind of currency.16 At the same time, 16 Compare the similar conclusion Alan Wilde comes to in his article, "Touching Earth: Virginia Woolf and the Prose of the World," in Philosophic Approaches to Literature: New Essays on Nineteenth- and Twentieth-Century Texts, ed. William E. Cain (Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 1984) 146-48: "In short, The Years suggests, equally, a rejection of what may be</page><page sequence="21">MICHAEL LUCEY I DISCONCERTING VOICES 277 however, it presents us with Eleanor, a sympathetic figure if ever there was one, whose movements of expansion and inclusion seem almost inevitably suc- cessful, and almost never to show the dark side of the coin.17 In the concluding section of this article, I want to look at one of the other great liberal institu- tions reinforcing the bright side of the coin in this novel, and the fate it suffers under this new critical scrutiny: the public library. IV. I need a little language such as lovers use, words of one syllable such as chil- dren speak when they come into a room and find their mother sewing and pick up some scrap of bright wool, a feather, or a shred of chintz. I need a howl; a cry.... None of those resonances and lovely echoes that break and chime from nerve to nerve in our breasts, making wild music, false phrases. I have done with phrases. The Waves, 199 Towards the end of "The Leaning Tower," Woolf holds up in front of her audi- ence a book as a sign of hope: This book was not bought; it was not hired. It was borrowed from a public li- brary. England lent it to a common reader, saying "It is time that even you, whom I have shut out from all my universities for centuries, should learn to read your mother tongue. I will help you."'18 described as the instrumental attitude toward the phenomenal, the attitude, so prevalent in the earlier novels, that takes things as a means, an avenue to vision; and, at the same time, a repudiation of the other hitherto pervasive notion of losing identity in the nonself.... [The Years] offers a sign, an initial sign, of a new attitude on Woolf's part: the acceptance, with all its complexity, its terrors and disappointments as well as its potential, of a world freed at last (and as a direct consequence of that acceptance) from the manipulative imperialism of self-consciousness and, on another level, from the compensatory domination of art." 17 One of her startling successes is the scene in which she learns of Nicholas's homosexuality. It is, of course, the impish Sara who informs on him: "Because he loves," Sara explained. She paused. "-the other sex, the other sex, you see," she said lightly, waving her hand in the way that was so like her mother's. For a second a sharp shiver of repugnance passed over Eleanor's skin as if a knife had sliced it. Then she realised that it touched nothing of importance. The sharp shiver passed. Underneath was-what? She looked at Nicholas. He was watching her. "Does that," he said, hesitating a little, "make you dislike me, Eleanor?" "Not in the least! Not in the least!" she exclaimed spontaneously. All the evening, off and on, she had been feeling about him; this, that, and the other; but now all the feelings came together and made one feeling, one whole-liking. "Not in the least," she said again. He gave her a little bow. She returned it with a little bow. (Y 297-98) One could wish that all such moments, where odious ideological allegiances are overcome, were so peaceful, so mutually self-reinforcing. The wounds of projection and introjection, however, rarely heal so quickly, at least in my experience, and in any case, it's not entirely clear that this happy "nod to nod" scenario is exactly what one is looking for. Sara's and Nicholas's first meeting happens off stage, for better or for worse, but the terms of their important friendship are suggested only a page after this encounter with Eleanor: "Cease to laugh at me for once, Sara," Nicholas was saying as he put on his coat. "And cease to lecture me," she said, opening the front door. Renny smiled at Eleanor as they stood for a moment by the perambulator. "Educating themselves!" he said. (Y 299) Renny is perhaps not wholly right in his evaluation. I find something more satisfying in the fact that Sara is laughing, and that neither of them is nodding. 18 Virginia Woolf, "The Leaning Tower," in The Moment and Other Essays (London: The Hogarth Press, 1981) 124.</page><page sequence="22">278 NOVEL I SPRING 1991 How is the commoner supposed to respond to this very liberal, but nonetheless rather overbearing gesture? What if that person has no interest in speaking that particular mother tongue, or reading that particular (or any) book? For Woolf herself, this was apparently never an option. Her father brought her home books from the library, and her stylistic practice, her way of dealing with books and of writing her own, became the battleground on which she fought her wars of inclusion and exclusion.'9 The question is whether or not she can successfully repeat her father's gesture of book-bringing in front of her audi- ence. This gesture finds itself echoed in The Years in, for example, the way we have seen Eleanor act as an intermediary between her porter's son and her brother Edward, the Oxford don, helping to open closed Oxford library doors to the lower classes. Delia's party itself, with which the novel concludes, is an- other such gesture: All sorts of people were there, she [Delia] noted. That had always been her aim; to mix people; to do away with the absurd conventions of English life. And she had done it tonight, she thought. There were nobles and commoners; people dressed and people not dressed; people drinking out of mugs, and people wait- ing with their soup getting cold for a spoon to be brought to them. (Y 398) Delia's party takes place in several rooms, one of which has books in it, and, being such an inclusive party, one might expect that any reading would be of an inclusive nature. What we see, however, whenever a character picks up a book, is a citation in a foreign language. Peggy, "marooned when the dance started," is the first reader, and hopes to find, in the book she picks off the shelf, an em- bodiment of her thoughts: "He'll say what I'm thinking, she thought.... Books opened at random always do" (Y 383). The book happens to be in French, and the citation is neither translated nor identified for us. "La mediocrite de l'univers m'etonne et me revolte ... la petitesse de toutes choses m'emplit de d&amp;- go^t ... la pauvret6 des etres humains m'an6antit." And does this match with Peggy's thoughts? "Precisely," comments this fortunately bilingual doctor. The next time someone picks up one of the books, the citation is in Latin. The reader is North, full of dim memories of Latin classes at school, with a slightly more sensual approach to the sound of strange words. He broke off a sentence and let it swim in his mind. There the words lay, beautiful, yet meaningless, yet composed in a pattern-nox est perpetua una dormienda. He remembered his master saying. Mark the long word at the end of the sentence. There the words floated; but just as they were about to give out their meaning, there was a movement at the door. (Y 393-94) 19 On this subject see the intriguing opening chapter of Perry Meisel's The Absent Father: Virginia Woolf and Walter Pater (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1980).</page><page sequence="23">MICHAEL LUCEY I DISCONCERTING VOICES 279 Again we are without a translation or a source.20 The final occurrence of this phenomenon has to do not with a book, but with Edward, who, for some reason, speaks out a line from the Antigone in Greek: North looked up. "Translate it," he said. Edward shook his head. "It's the language," he said. Then he shut up. (Y 414) This kind of library is going to provide some difficulties for a commoner, gold mine though it may be to those of us with erudition, or bilingual editions, or at least dictionaries of quotations, or even the ability to understand more than one tongue. But consider what happens when the two children of the caretaker of this building, potential future common readers, enter into this library, this repository of culture, this party of easy access.21 The scene with these two children doubles the much earlier scene when Maggie and Sara, as children, re- sponded to the demands placed on them by adults (such as their father Digby and their uncle Abel) in a discomforting way. This time Peggy asks the young pair if they haven't been taught at school, that other door to culture, some song they could sing for the party, a song, no doubt, meant to recall nostalgically the happy days of the adults' own childhood. What they certainly do not want (but what they get) is a song which will act as Sara's deformity acted on Abel, mirroring back to him his own condition. Here the mirroring has to do with for- eign languages. If these adults know so many foreign languages the children don't, then the children, rather than showing the expected desire to assimilate peacefully the adult culture, simply replicate the gap, exhibiting a language and culture in turn alien and incomprehensible to the adults:22 20 The source is Catullus V. For a discussion of the relevance of the citation to the novel, see Mitchell A. Leaska, "Virginia Woolf, The Pargeter: A Reading of The Years," Bulletin of the New York Public Library 80 (Winter 1977): 196-200. In an earlier section of the novel, we encounter Eleanor reading in a foreign language, but, as we might expect within the sphere of Eleanor's inclusiveness, both the source (Dante) and a translation are provided within the text (Y 212). This passage, too, has attracted critical commentary. See Bruce Robbins, The Servant's Hand: English Fiction from Below (New York: Columbia University Press, 1986) 51-52. See also Leaska, 191, 206, or Margaret Comstock's essay in the same issue of the Bulletin, "The Loudspeaker and the Human Voice: Politics and the Form of The Years," 268. There is an interesting discussion of the relationship between women and the foreign languages they half understand or understand not at all in Patricia Yaeger's book Honey-Mad Women: Emancipatory Strategies in Women's Writing (New York: Columbia University Press, 1988). For example, while discussing The Mill on the Floss, Yaeger quotes Eliot: "The mysterious sentences, snatched from an unknown context-like strange horns of beasts, and leaves of unknown plants, brought from some far-off region,-gave boundless scope to her [Maggie's] imagination, and were all the more fascinating because they were in a peculiar tongue of their own, which she could learn to interpret," then comments: "Maggie finds a gustatory pleasure in Latin words because they exist in an interpretable 'tongue of their own' and because they have already been split off from their syntactic context-they are already fractional" (54-55). 21 I am the beneficiary of many previous readings of this complicated scene. Among them are James Naremore, "Nature and History in The Years," in Virginia Woolf. Revaluation and Continuity, ed. Ralph Freedman (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1980) 261-62; Jane Marcus, Virginia Woolf and the Languages of Patriarchy (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1987) 11, 38, 47, 49-50, 65-66; Joanna Lipking, "Looking at the Monuments: Woolf's Satiric Eye," Bulletin of the New York Public Library 80 (Winter 1977): 144; Lucio P. Ruotolo, The Interrupted Moment: A View of Virginia Woolf s Novels (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1986) 203; Allen McLaurin, Virginia Woolf: The Echoes Enslaved, 109. 22 We notice again, that as was the case with Sara, we are close to slipping into a reading of the children's character, their intentions, thus in some way reenacting the masterful death of Anon, the new contractual capture of Mrs. Brown. It is not clear that I, or any of the other critics who claim to understand this song or its intent, are really in any position to arrogate this privilege.</page><page sequence="24">280 NOVEL I SPRING 1991 They stared at her [Peggy] but remained silent. They had stopped eating. They were a centre of a little group. They swept their eyes over the grown-up people for a moment, then, each giving the other a little nudge, they burst into song: Etho passo tanno hai, Fai donk to tu do, Mai to, kai to, lai to see Toh dom to tuh do- That was what it sounded like. Not a word was recognisable. The distorted sounds rose and sank as if they followed a tune. They stopped. They stood with their hands behind their backs. Then with one impulse they attacked the next verse: Fanno to par, etto to mar, Timin tudo, tido, Foll to gar in, mitno to par, Eido, tedo, meido- They sang the second verse more fiercely than the first. The rhythm seemed to rock and the unintelligible words ran themselves together almost into a shriek. The grown-up people did not know whether to laugh or to cry. Their voices were so harsh; the accent was so hideous. They burst out again: Chree to gay ei, Geeray didax ... Then they stopped. It seemed to be in the middle of a verse. They stood there grinning, silent, looking at the floor. Nobody knew what to say. There was something horrible in the noise they made. It was so shrill, so discordant, and so meaningless. (Y 429-30) A lot of tables are turned here. None of the cultural accumulation of the mem- bers of the audience suffices to allow them a way in to this performance.23 Further, the children seem finally to achieve the meaninglessness of sound that has, up to this point, even been denied to the birds. One member of the audience will try to fob off their problems onto the putatively Cockney accent in which the children sing. Is it possible for us, or anyone, to imagine that the children's song is simply not meant to be read, but rather is (meant to be) something that cannot be aesthetically assimilated? For another fictive moment of singing, where an aesthetic gap figures a political irresolution, see Alain Robbe-Grillet's La Jalousie (Paris: Minuit, 1957) 99-101, where the second chauffeur sings "un air indigene, aux paroles incomprdhensibles, ou mCme sans paroles." The uninterpretable nature of the song is described in very similar terms to the one from The Years: A cause du caracttre particulier de ce genre de melodies, il est difficile de determiner si le chant s'est interrompu pour une raison fortuite--en relation, par exemple, avec le travail manuel que doit executer en meme temps le chanteur-ou bien si l'air trouvait hl safin naturelle. De mbme, lorsqu'il recommence, c'est aussi subit, aussi abrupt, sur des notes qui ne paraissent gubre constituer un debut, ni une reprise. A d'autres endroits, en revanche, quelque chose semble en train de se terminer; tout l'indique: une retombee progressive, le calme retrouvg, le sentiment que plus rien ne reste &amp; dire; mais aprks la note qui devait etre la dernikre en vient une suivante, sans la moindre solution de continuitg, avec la m~me aisance, puis une autre, et d'autres 4 la suite, et I'auditeur se croit transportg en plein coeur du pokme...quand, M1, tout s'arrete, sans avoir prevenu.</page><page sequence="25">MICHAEL LUCEY I DISCONCERTING VOICES 281 Even Eleanor has difficulty absorbing the challenge of this otherness. (Sara appears to sleep through the song, so we have no idea how she might have re- acted to these strange followers of hers.) There is no way, Eleanor realizes, to make a whole out of this experience. As they stood there they had looked so dignified; yet they had made this hideous noise. The contrast between their faces and their voices was astonish- ing; it was impossible to find one word for the whole. "Beautiful?" she said, with a note of interrogation, turning to Maggie. "Extraordinarily," said Maggie. But Eleanor was not sure that they were thinking of the same thing. (Y 430- 31, emphasis added) The word beautiful seems to cross the gap neither between the children's voices and their faces, nor the gap between Maggie and Eleanor. The rupture of this communion, the dissolution of a common aesthetic sense, is the affair only of a moment. It is doubtful that any novel could sustain it for very long. The pigeons, Eleanor notices, immediately begin to croon reassuringly again: "Take two coos, Taffy, take two coos..." (Y 433). But Eleanor is dis- tracted; she has been made pensive. Delia has to ask her several times if she doesn't find Maggie's flowers beautiful, and even when agreeing, she does so with her attention directed elsewhere. When she turns her attention back to the party which is in the process of breaking up, it is, startlingly, in order to ask a version of Sara's question: Then she turned round into the room. "And now?" she said, looking at Morris, who was drinking the last drops of a glass of wine. "And now?" she asked, holding out her hands to him. (Y 434-35) Eleanor's ability to ask Sara's and a child's question at the same moment as she holds out her hands to her favorite brother in her usual effort at communion raises interesting problems for reading, for us reading. For Sara and Eleanor seem to have presented up to now different and irreconcilable ways of reading. Eleanor opens herself to the children's song and tries to engulf it so as to be able to judge it beautiful. Sara's way of reading is to hear sounds and then to throw them back, playing a strange laughing game in the field between sounds and language, always asking for more phonic material with which to play. The fi- nal sentence of the novel, which presents yet another anthropomorphic, roman- tic landscape, inclines towards Eleanor: "The sun had risen, and the sky above the houses wore an air of extraordinary beauty, simplicity and peace." But be- tween Maggie's "extraordinarily" and Eleanor's "beautiful" one might choose to hear either the discordant voice of the two children or Sara's disconcerting laughter.</page></plain_text>
