THE HORSE De hoc equo varia in historiis lecta sunt: ut Hyginus et Tubero dicunt, machinamentum bellicum fuit .... ut alii, porta quam eis Antenor aperuit, equum pictum habuisse memoratur .... non nulli signum equi datum ut internoscerent Graeci suos, vel hostes .... aut quia equestri proelio victa est Troia .... aut a monte Hippio, post quem se absconderant Graeci .... aut re vera hoc fuit quod Vergilius sequitur. T HESE excerpts from Servius' com- mentary on Aeneid ii. 15 illustrate the uncertainty that from an early date has surrounded the story of the Tro- jan horse, and the variety of interpreta- tions to which that uncertainty has given rise. The main outlines of the story are given by three passages in the Odyssey.' In a large wooden horse, made by Epeios with Athena's help, chosen warriors were inclosed. The rest of the Greeks burned their camp and sailed away. The Trojans hauled the horse up to their acropolis and, after taking all that trouble, sat down to discuss whether they should chop it up, push it over a cliff, or let it stand. No mention is made of any difficulty with gates or walls. The inclosed heroes, with the exception of Neoptolemus and Odys- seus, were in a very nervous state and al- most betrayed themselves. At night they emerged, and in co-operation with their comrades of the fleet, who had meanwhile returned, they sacked Troy. This sum- mary Vergil enriches by an explicit ac- count of the torch-signal and the return of the fleet, implied in the Odyssey, and by the addition of Sinon and Laocoon. We must, with Servius, recognize that too little is known about the religious be- liefs of the Trojans and the constructive ability of the Achaeans to permit us to 1 Od. iv. 271 if.; vii. 492 if.; xi. 523 ff. say with absolute certainty that the story as related by Vergil cannot be substan- tially true. Yet to accept this account as historical fact involves ascribing to the Trojans a degree of credulity or infatua- tion that ancient and modern critics alike have felt to exceed the bounds of plausi- bility. The readiest rationalization, and the most popular, is to regard the horse as some kind of siege engine. To the genera- tions familiar with the exploits of Hellen- istic military engineering, this must have been a fairly obvious solution. Vergil hints at it, Pliny and Pausanias take it for granted.2 Yet this interpretation finds no support either in literary tradition or in archeology and requires us to dismiss all the traditional story except the two de- tails that the horse was made of wood and that it contained armed men. All the ac- counts of its operation must go. It is strange that tradition should have pre- served a memory of the making and suc- cessful use of a novel siege device, which succeeded where so many other expedi- ents3 had failed, and should have forgot- ten the surely spectacular scene of its ap- proach to the wall, forgotten it so com- pletely that, for an attack by a triumphant army, pushing its irresistible machine against the doomed city, was substituted 2 Aet. ii. 46, 151; NH vii. 202; Paus. i. 23. 8. 3 The bringing of Neoptolemus, of Philoctetes withl Heracles' bow, of the bones of Pelops, and the theft of the Palladium.

The difficulties involved in the siege- machine hypothesis are so great that some have preferred to see in the wooden horse simply a misunderstood metaphor for a ship.4 The metaphor is, indeed, compara- tively easy-so easy, in fact, that it is hard to see why it should have been so completely misunderstood. This explana- tion accounts, indeed, for the material and the contents of the horse, but it abandons consideration of such points as these: that the horse was a novel and unique device, that it was a last desperate idea at the end of a long siege, that it was taken by the citizens into an inland town, and that it required the absence of the fleet for its successful operation. It might also be ob- jected that the taking of Troy demanded the use of whole herds of such wooden horses, and for many years. Indeed, the difficulties of this theory are so great that Van Leeuwen, at the end of his brilliant exposition, finds himself compelled to sup- pose that the story of the wooden horse really refers to the taking of some other town somewhere else, probably a seaport, by someone else, perhaps Achilles, pre- sumably with only one ship. One could hardly ask for a more complete demon- stration that, for explaining the Trojan horse, the equation horse = ship is alto- gether useless. The mechanical explanations, which agree in discarding the magical and reli- gious elements in the story, explain how some legend of some wooden horse might have sprung up; but they do not explain the connection of this legend, in its actual form, with the taking of Troy. W. F. J. Knight concentrates his attention on the 4 See J. van Leeuwen, Commentationes Homericae (L agd. Bat., 1911), pp. 170 ff. magical aspects and implications of the legend.5 This approach can dispense with all historical reference and content itself with examining the superstitions and be- liefs that went to the shaping of a certain literary tradition, every bit of which may well be pure poetic or mythologic inven- tion. The great advantage of this method is that it can handle all the evidence, without being obliged to seek consistency or conformity to what is physically pos- sible. This seems to have proved, so far, the most promising avenue of approach. Along similar lines, P. M. Schuhl6 has drawn at- tention to the brazen horse in the Gyges story (Plato Rep. 359 D) and to the em- ployment of the horse in myth as a sym- bol of death. Further extension of this ap- proach may lead to more material for the explanation of the story, and it may not be necessary in so doing to lose touch en- tirely with the historical record. II. THE EARTHQUAKE That any city in the Troad was exposed to the danger of earthquake is obvious from the geographical history of the re- gion. That the site generally regarded as the site of Troy was more than once devas- tated by earthquakes is the conclusion drawn by C. W. Blegen7 from the archeo- logical evidence. Earthquake seems the most plausible explanation of the catas- trophe that overtook Troy II, leaving such rich remains behind; and Blegen be- lieves that, on the available evidence, it seems most likely that "the third and fourth cities are not really two separate periods, but merely represent two succes- sive stages in a slowly developing homo- geneous civilization, interrupted by a seri- ous catastrophe, perhaps an earthquake"; and, again, "one is tempted to attribute 6 CP, XXV (1930), 358 if.; XXVI (1931), 412 f.: and Vergil's Troy (Oxford, 1932). 6 Rev. arch., VII (1936), 183 if. 7 AJA, XXXIX (1935), 10 if. and 550 if.</page><page sequence="3">152 L. A. MACKAY the downfall of the Sixth city to a cata- strophic earthquake." Later he says (pp. 550 f.): WVe concluded from a study of the archi- tectural and ceramic evidence that Troy VI came to its end, probably in a severe earth- quake, not long after 1300 B.C., that Troy VIJa, wlhich immediately succeeded and which was constructed to a great extent of fallen material from the buildings of the Sixth Settlement, miaintained its existence for approximately a century until it was destroyed, doubtless by liuman agency, in a great conflagration in the early years of the twelfth century. Following this conflagration, new cultural elements appear in Troy VJIb, so that it is apparently this catastrophe, if any, that we must equate with the Homeric legend. Evidence of human agency in the destruc- tion of a city which had to be "frequently repaired or rebuilt as the result of severe earthquakes" does not rule out the possi- bility that earthquake contributed to that disaster as well. References to earthquake are plentiful in the traditional accounts of the siege. In II. xx. 57 there is an earthquake violent enough to alarm Hades; but there is no mention of any harm done to the walls or buildings of the city. The tidal wave8 that leveled the camp of the Achaeans might be taken as evidence of seismic activity. Vergil's account of the fall of Troy intro- duces an unmistakable and very thorough earthquake, personally conducted by Neptune (Aen. ii. 608 ff.). There is an earthquake in Seneca's Troades (175 if.), but it seems to be merely literary embel- lishment, to accompany the appearance of Achilles' ghost. Euripides (Troades 1326) mentioned an (Voats, but this seems to refer only to the concussion of falling towers. Quintus Smyrnaeus has a plethora aII. xil. 13 if. This is speciflcally associated with a clouidbturst; Paus. vii. 24. 6 notes the occasional coI1- junction in the Aegean area of earthquakes anld heavy rains. of earthquakes. In xii. 94 ff., Zeus sends an earthquake to deter Neoptolemus and Philoctetes from taking Troy by storm before the proper date. In xii. 176 the earth trembles as the gods join in abortive conflict. In xii. 396 if. Athena sends what is apparently a private earthquake that serves only to blind Laocoon. The extrav- agant disproportion of means to end might suggest that Quintus found an earthquake somewhere in the tradition and was trying to work it in as best he could. If so, he had another try in xii. 509 f., where another earthquake is listed as one of the evil portents that followed the introduction of the horse into the city. It may be, of course, that he just liked earthquakes. Tryphiodorus 338 has Posei- don with his trident open the gate for the entry of the horse and, like Vergil, couples an earthquake with the fall of Troy (568 f.). If we suppose that the Greeks entered Troy by taking advantage of the confu- sion and damage consequent on a severe earthquake, several otherwise recalci- trant features of the tradition will fall into the pattern. The departure of the Greek fleet, we may then assume, was a genuine abandonment of the expedition, on account of the losses by plague. The discouraged speech of Agamemnon (I!. ii. 110 ff.) and the subsequent rush of the Greeks to embark may contain an obscure memory of this. The abandonment of the enterprise is also consonant with the con- fusion and disagreement in the Greek ac- counts of what was necessary for the cap- ture of Troy: the presence of Neoptole- mus, Philoctetes and the bow of Heracles, and the bones of Pelops, the theft of the Palladium, and, finally, the device of the wooden horse. Again, the problem of who gave the fire-signal, and when, disappears if there was no signal, only the conflagra- tion consequent on the earthquake. There</page><page sequence="4">THE EARTHQUAKE-HORSE 153 is, indeed, no place for either Sinon or Laocoon. Perhaps the disastrous storm that dispersed the Greeks on their return and so weakened the victors that only with difficulty, if at all, could they regain control of their own kingdoms is a reminis- cence of the waves produced by the earth- quake. Some ships, riding out the storm, returned to take advantage of the confu- sion and complete the destruction of the doomed city, so recently given over to justified rejoicing. The assumed catas- trophe comes at a moment very dramati- cally opportune, but no more so than whatever disaster brouight down the walls of Jerichlo and hardlly more so than the t imnely change in weatlher that covered the withdrawal from Dunkirk. To collect ex- amples of historical coincidence wouldi not strengthen the case for it here; it is enough if the coincidence is admitted to be possi- ble. Its justification must lie in its co- ordination of the traditional evidence. III. THE EARTHQUAKE-HORSE Between the horse and the earthquake there is an obvious link in the god Posei- don, who is concerned also with the walls of Troy. The horse is his peculiar at- tribute, and Poseidon Hippios is associ- ated primarily not with the sea Poseidon but with the inland Poseidon.9 Thessaly, Arcadia, Boeotia, and Laconia are the chief centers of his worship; in Attica not on the extensive coast, but at inland Co- lonus is his shrine. The identification is, indeed, nothing new. Hesychius (s.v. 'yat,oxos) and the Etymologicum magnum (223. 2) testify to a linking of the concep- tions of Poseidon Gaieochos, Ennosigaios, 9 L. Malten, "Das Pferd im Totenglauben," Jahrb. Deutsch. Arch. Inst., XXIX (1914), 184: "Die Sagen selbst lehren, was Wilamowitz zuerst scharf formu- liert hat, dass der loae&amp;6mop 'r1rLos Ersatz ist fur den HOaetbav '1I7ros . Zugleich beweisen sie (was bei der Natur des Pferdes als Landtier auch das Gegebene ist), dass das Pferd bereits dem festliindischen Poseidon gehort." and Hippios.1O Nor is the chthonic sig- nificance of the horse limited to its rela- tion with Poseidon. The horse, both in legend and in art, may be a direct symbol of the underground powers." Direct iden- tification of the horse as an earthquake symbol is difficult, but the well-known stories of the ride of Curtius, the rape of Proserpina, and the original emergence of the horse from the rock smitten by Poseidon's trident indicate that there was felt to be a connection. If it be granted that a horse might con- ceivably symbolize an earthquake, it re- mains to ask how, in the tale of Troy, the confusion could have arisen. In view of the loving attention with which the epic tech- nique details the building of a raft, the preparation of a mueal, the arming of a warrior, or the path of a weapon's pene- tration, it is strange that the operation of such a technically interesting device as the wooden horse should be completely for- gotten or misunderstood, if there ever had been a wooden horse and if the tradi- tion had been verbal from the first. On the other hand, confusion is exactly what nmight be expected if the story was derived in part from a pictorial representation. The legends of Salmoneus, Sisyphus, and the Danaids have been shown to be prob- ably in large part misinterpretations of pictorial records." The explanations that local guides, even in these times of copious written records, can give of monuments and sculptures make it easy to believe in the possibility of such misconstructions. 10 Cf. Roscher, Lexicon, III, 2, 2834: "Im pelo- ponnesischen Festland scheidet sich der chthonische P. Yathoxos, TTr7twO, ?7rrObf77s scharf vom attisch- ionischen Meerposeidon"; and cf. Xen.

MACKAY If we try to imagine a scene commemor- ating pictorially the fall of Troy"3 through the double calamity of earthquake and at- tack, it is obvious that a simple scene of ruin does not suffice; the ruin might be the work of the invading army. An earth- quake is hard to identify pictorially, but it can be symbolized by the figure of a horse, representing either Poseidon or un- specified underground powers, especially in a formidable aspect. With the triumph of anthropomorphic divinities, the older theriomorphic symbols were disregarded, degraded, or misunderstood. Perhaps if the Iliad, or the stories behind it, had grown up in the community that suffered the disaster, the interpretation miglit have been handed down with the symbol. But the stories seem not to have taken shape in that community or even in those that tradition regards as most directly con- cerned with the taking of Troy. The ac- counts in Herodotus and Daniel of the taking of Babylon show what a free hand legend could take at a much later date with the fall of a much greater city. Once the horse was no longer recog- nized as divine, or at least "damonisch," the sheer size that previously expressed its divinity must now identify it as a con- struction,14 and wood is the only material 13 Representations that can, without question, be identifled as the Trojan horse are few, and not all of them show the horse in action. R. Hampe (Frishe griechische Sagenbilder in Bootien [Athens, 19361, pp. 50 f.) lists eight, all presupposing the Homeric form of the story. The earliest are an eighth-century flbula showing the horse, but with no background, or at least none preserved; a sixth-century Corinthian aryballos (Payne, Necrocorinthia, 1281, and Jahrb. Deutsch. Arch. Inst, Vol. VII [18921, PI. 2) with an admirable representation of the traditional scene; and a sixth-century fragment shown, ibid., XLVI (1931), 51. 14 Athena had no interest in the horse other than in its manufacture; but as soon as it was regarded as an imninense construction, she was the obvious deity to from which craftsmen of that age could have built a structure of that size and shape. Since the horse, as the agent of de- struction, would be portrayed within or above the citadel, it was necessary to in- vent some explanation of how it got there -an explanation consistent with the tra- dition that the Trojans, just before the fall of their city, were celebrating the repulse of the Greeks. The presence of armed men in the horse is further poetic guesswork,15 inspired, perhaps, by misinterpretation of the perspective of the composition. The portrayal of some men still disembarling from the ships would then give all the ma- terials needed for manufacturing the tra- ditional version of the story. Even if some memory of the eaithquiake still lingered, as it seems to have done, it could not stand the competition of an explanation more flattering to Greek pride. This interpretation seems in a sense more extreme than the mechanical inter- pretations; it evaporates even the material and the contents of the horse. It does claim, however, to account for more de- tails of the tradition, including some that other explanations do not account for at all, and, where a detail is regarded as in- vented, to explain why the invention took that particular shape. At the same time it attempts to attach the story specifically to the historical event with which it is tra- ditionally associated. UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA supervise its making. Sinon says it was an offering to her; but Sinon was not a truthful man. Why its construction was attributed to Epeios, a champion boxer and unsuccessful weight-thrower, I cannot imagine. 15 Knight points out (CP, XXV [19301, 358) that one form of the tradition seems not to admit of warriors being Inside the horse.</page></plain_text>
