Vidya Dehejia's study is the first overview of Buddhist visual narratives in Indian art. This is surprising, since Indian Buddhist narrative tradition is rich and extensive, particularly in the early centuries of its development, and also since many studies have focused on certain sites, top- ics, and time-periods. Dehejia's book functions as a broad and comprehensive survey. The study grew out of an important article Dehejia published in 1990 in The Art Bulletin entitled "On Modes of Visual Narration in Early Buddhist Art." She has retained this material as the core of her methodological approach to the narratives, and the study is her first book chapter, essen- tially unchanged from the article. There are a few differences and additions, but she keeps the seven-part typology of the narrative reliefs, with sections of the article's text occurring in the book as well. This first chapter along with two oth- ers make up Part I of the book, chapters that outline the more theoretical and methodological dimensions of the study preparing the reader for the detailed analysis of art, arranged mostly chronologically by site or region, in the nine chapters of Part II of the book. There are also seven appendices. The first chapter's seven types of narrative structure are the formal compositions Indian artists used to tell the sto- ries. This is predominantly stone relief sculptures for the Buddhist material studied here, from their first appearance in the second century B.C. until Buddhism ends in most areas of India in the 13th century A.D. The only exception to stone reliefs are the 5th-century paintings at Ajantal and the much later appearance of manuscript illustration of around the IIth century A.D. While the title of Dehejia's book states the focus is on "early" Buddhist art, she deals with the entire Indian Buddhist tradition. Dehejia's seven types are based on visual modes famil- iar to art historians of other geographical areas and tradi- tions, such as Roman or Christian narrative art. While I have not attempted to determine if any are found only in the Indian Buddhist tradition, Dehejia does not claim that any are unique. In other words, we may be dealing here with a universal artistic narrative typology; perhaps, when using an essentially two-dimensional artistic space (either stone relief or painting), there is a limited number of possible formal figural compositions. Dehejia's seven modes of narration are: (I) Monoscenic narrative: Themes ofaction: single episode from a story, usually neither the first nor last, but one that introduces a theme of action. (2) Monoscenic narrative: Being in state versus being in action: single episode from a story, usually showing the Buddha in a culminating episode of a life scene. (3) Sequential narrative: multiple episodes of a story with protagonist repeated, depicted in separate frames in a linear order. (Dehejia called this "linear narrative" in her initial Art Bulletin article.) (4) Continuous narrative: multiple episodes of a story with protagonist repeated, depicted within a single frame. (5) Synoptic narrative: multiple episodes of a story with protagonist repeated, depicted within a single frame but without attempt to indicate any chronological sequence. (6) Conflated narrative: the same as synoptic, but rather than having multiple protagonists depicted, the pro- tagonist is conflated into one figure. (7) Narrative networks: characterized by extreme disre- gard for temporal sequencing with extensive and seem- ingly arbitrary placement of narrative scenes. These narrative types are sometimes clearly differentiated, but often they share features, and at times I think they over- lap. For example, the Dipankara jataka (her fig. 19) that she identifies as conflated narrative could, as far as I can see, be considered continuous or perhaps synoptic narrative as well.2 But Dehejia would not, I think, be insistent on all her identifications. She recognizes the "multivalence" of Indian art and writes in a non-dogmatic prose throughout the book. Yet the reader will need to keep these various modes clearly in mind, because she uses them to organize all of dis- cussions of material in Part II. One point she brings up in this introductory chapter that is of particular interest is the relative importance of place and time in the visual narratives. Basically, she sug- 355</page><page sequence="2">gests that the Indian narratives stress place over time in their telling. The lack of clarity in the chronology ofa story makes the narrative difficult to follow. Dehejia published a separate article in 1998 on the topic entitled "India's Visual Narratives: The Dominance of Space Over Time,"3 which is pretty much a restatement of her first book chapter, but she makes the point even more forcefully that only two of the seven narrative modes (i.e., sequential and continuous) "are concerned with clarifying temporal progression.""4 Again, it may be that these are the only two ways possible with two- dimensional space to "tell" a story chronologically, but the important point is that these modes were not commonly used in Indian art, and then to ask why? The implications are suggestive of how history was considered in ancient India, a topic that is presently undergoing intense rethink- ing by scholars, but a discourse to which art history has contributed little.5 It appears to me that the past is being remembered in the Buddhist visual narratives in terms of a Karmic history represented by the Buddha, but one that was not being told as a chronological story. The second chapter also takes up a topic about which Dehejia has previously published what she calls "The Mul- tivalent Sign in Early Buddhist Art."6 By a multivalent sign she means simply that an artistic sign can have more than one meaning or interpretation, a tree interpreted, for exam- ple, as indicating the Buddha's presence in a life scene while simultaneously referring to the site at which the scene took place. The discussion of early Buddhist symbols is familiar to all scholars of Indian art history today, as it is among the most intriguing topics being researched, and Dehejia's voice has been at the center of the debate, which focuses on the nature of early "aniconic" images. Yet Dehejia has added a new twist in the book, suggesting a semiotic reading based on Charles Peirce's typology of the sign as icon, index, and symbol. In her previous publications on the topic, she sug- gested that early Buddhist "emblems" could be interpreted in three ways: "as sacred sites, as the physical presence of the Buddha, and as Buddhist ideals or attributes."7 She feels that these three can remain and be fit into the Peircean tri- part rubric of the sign: icon as site, index as trace, and sym- bol as meaning. Dehejia says by introducing this terminology she hopes to get rid of the word "aniconic" and its interpretive bag- gage (p. 54). Scholarship in most academic areas has reached the revisionist (post-modern) position of intense house- cleaning, tossing out words too overburdened with wrong meanings to be safely used anymore.8 Also, reading Indian art semiologically makes sense, and it is surprising more work has not attempted it. Indian art as a symbol system is basic to our discipline and to the material itself, and we should stop feeling we have to apol- ogize for treating it as such. Still, I think Dehejia will need to argue the use of Peirce's typology more rigorously. She uses Peirce's crucial idea of the index as "representing" or pointing to the absent Buddha, thus producing his pres- ence. She is influenced in finding the absence as indexical by Rosalind Krauss's use of index in speaking about certain modern artists, where the trace of something absent (like a shadow is a trace or index of a person who might not be seen directly) is central.9 While such indexes are very suggestive of the absent anthropomorphic Buddha in the earliest Bud- dhist art, it is important to realize that Peirce's notion of the index is not only of these types of traces but is, to use Milton Singer's phrase, a sign that "is contiguous with its object or physically related to it."'o Thus, while an umbrella over the riderless horse on the Sanchi departure scene is indeed an index in Peirce's terms, as Dehejia argues, so is the umbrella over a Buddha image. The indexical sign does not help us particularly with the aniconic. The third chapter deals with Buddhist textual stories and their relationship with visual representations. Dehejia makes the point that the image tradition is not simply that of producing illustrations of written or told stories. The heart of Buddhist visual narrative scholarship has linked written texts to images, and she must be commended for getting away from this approach by structuring her study around the seven formal artistic modes. In this chapter she speaks of the many difficulties and pitfalls of using texts to identify and date visual narratives. Much of the chapter is a very handy survey of texts and schools to which they are related. Given the complicated organization and great number of Buddhist texts, her chapter is a helpful sorting out of the material. The second part of the book, the bulk of the text, sur- veys the narratives through the end of Buddhism in India. It begins with Sanchi Stupa 2 (chapt. 4), then Bharhut (5), Sanchi Stupa I (6), Bodh Gaya, Mathura, early Amaravati and early Ajanta (together in 7), then Amaravati and Nagarjunakonda (8), Gandhara (9), Ajanta (Io), and ends with the ph century and later developments in chapter II. The final chapter 12 is a conclusion. Each chapter is organ- ized with an introduction to the site(s), a detailed discus- sion of visual examples using the seven-modes typology, conclusions regarding the texts used, and thoughts about the patronage based on inscriptions. The examples analyzed are extensive. Each is illustrated, and it works well that the illustrations are placed within the text itself and not at the end. 356</page><page sequence="3">How, then, does the development of visual narratives progress ? The tradition begins with Sanchi Stupa 2 (Dehe- jia dates it "around the start of the Ist century B.C.E.") and the first use of stone for sacred monuments. Stupa 2's stone fence is decorated with reliefs carved on pillars and roundels, but the reliefs cannot be read as narratives. Rather, they are predominantly lotuses, or such images as trees, pillars, and wheels. Dehejia interprets these images as symbols of Bud- dhist doctrines, so the wheel is doctrinal truth, the tree becomes the wisdom of enlightenment. Mireille Benisti in her 1986 article "Observations concernant le stupa no. 2 de Sanci"I argued that none of the reliefs at Sanchi 2 could be interpreted as having a specifically Buddhist meaning but were part of a pan-Indian religious or auspicious syllabary. In either interpretation, the story-telling is yet to be ex- pressed visually. However, the assumption is that stories - both those about the Buddha's past births and about his life - were being told orally. In chapter 3 on text and image Dehejia, citing textual scholars, finds many narrative texts (written down only later, mostly A.D.) dating to Asoka's time. It is interesting that none of the seven Buddhist texts Asoka mentions in the Bhabra Edict for the monastic and lay devotees to listen to appear to be a narrative, but more collections of aphorisms along the line of the Dhammapada.'" I bring this up because, as far as I can see, we have no solid evidence of an extensive narrative tradition in Indian Bud- dhism until, in fact, the next monument that Dehejia deals with, Bharhut. I wonder why Dehejia has not discussed the reliefs in vihara 19 at Bhaja at this point, as they are con- temporary with Stupa 2, have thus far defied being inter- preted as narratives and would seem to be a vital source for her arguments about how visual narratives began in India. Within merely a few decades of Stupa 2 (at least by 80o B.C.) the situation is very different. The stone fence of the Bharhut stupa is covered with narrative reliefs of the Bud- dha's present and past lives, and this begins a period of some 5oo years of truly incredible use of narrative scenes to dec- orate Buddhist monastic monuments. In surveying this material, Dehejia shows that even from the beginnings at Bharhut, all seven of her modes are in operation, although each site will use some of them more than others. She also shows that their use and arrangement within the monu- ments often appear arbitrary. No overall thematic schemas can be identified. She tends to explain the arbitrary selec- tion and organization of the narrative as due to the type of patronage at these early Buddhist sites, that of many indi- viduals - both monastic and lay - with literally hundreds of individuals donating and each donor giving his or her preferences and favorites. This might help to explain the themes and stories chosen, but it would not explain which mode the artist chose. Again, perhaps it was simply up to the artist. Of course, such individual choice of many patrons does not help at a site like Nagarjunakonda, where the patrons were few and elite. There is a radical falling off of Buddhist visual narra- tives after the 5th century. Dehejia argues that this is pri- marily due to changes in the type of Buddhism, to interest in cosmic Buddhas and away from that of the earthly Shakyamuni, and thus of the stories about him. Anyone who reads through the book will gain a good overview of Buddhist narrative art in India, and the seven modes used to categorize it will enable the reader to think about what is an enormous and complicated corpus of mate- rial. Yet the book leaves room for further discussion and other questions to be asked. Although Dehejia has actually used her narrative-modes to analyze a I7th-century Mewari series of Ramayana paintings,13 the relationship among Hindu and Jaina narrative traditions and that of the Bud- dhists needs careful study. Isolating one religious tradition, particularly for such a topic as artistic narratives, will not give the whole story. One also wonders whether ancient visitors to the mon- uments were as bewildered as we often are in untangling the images ? The notion that they would have had the often very long and complicated stories clearly in their heads - and that they spent time mentally telling themselves the stories - seems unlikely to me. Indeed, we seem to have the advan- tage, as we sit in our studies with the many texts indexed and stories clearly stated. But did the artists think of their art in terms of the seven modes? In an earlier article, I brought up some of these issues, specifically in regard to Dehejia's initial Art Bulletin article, where I basically argued that (using visualjataka stories) the images were not intended to tell us a story at all.'4 In a response to my arti- cle, Joanna Williams felt I was advocating not looking at the art, which I certainly did not intend to imply.'5 But it is true that Dehejia's approach treats the art as if it were on the walls of a museum or on the screen in a classroom. This is a valid way of looking at the material, but I do not think it is how the ancient worshippers at these Buddhsit monu- ments saw it. ROBERT L.
