<plain_text><page sequence="1">Literature &amp; Theology, Vol. 15. No. 2, June 2001 'MONT BLANC': TRANSCENDENCE IN SHELLEY'S RELATIONAL SYSTEM Fazel Abroon Abstract Transcendence in its Platonic form in the works of Shelley is much discussed by students of the poet. Lillian Winstanley's article 'Platonism in Shelley' (1913) represents one of the early attempts in this field. Carl Grabo's The Magic Plant: The Growth of Shelley's Thought (1936) represents an example of a Neoplatonic approach to Shelley's thought and philosophy. Carlos Baker in his Shelley's Major Poetry (1948) discusses Shelley's Platonism and empiricism. James A. Notopoulos's The Platonism of Shelley (1949) presents the most thorough research on the subject. Notopoulos traces three kinds of Platonism in Shelley's thought: natural, direct, and indirect. Shelley's natural Platonism, he observes, comprises those Platonic elements that exist due to the operation of the poet's mind, untouched by the Platonic tradition. The direct Platonism of Shelley is the result of his reading of Plato. And finally, Shelley's indirect Platonism is affected by his encyclopaedic reading of literature influenced by the Platonic tradition. However, Shelley, I assume, differs from Plato in that he neither gives an ontological priority to the archetypes nor reduces the phenomenal beings to insubstantial shadows of the fixed entities. Although he believes in transcendence and the existence of an ontological being, he considers both the world of archetypes, or the immanent Power, and the phenom enal as interdependent, dynamic and relational rather than ontological. Nevertheless his belief in the relational and interdependent existence does not bring him closer to the deconstructionists as he also assumes the existence of an ontological, imperceptible and transcendent being. Shelley speaks of transcendence in certain unforgettable images: Mont Blanc, the symbol of the unknown Power, and Demogorgon's ineffable deep truth being the most important. Mont Blanc is the symbol of thingness, thing without referentiality; a sign, though it cannot properly be called so, with no signified. It exists where there is no linguistic or sign system, and therefore, it is beyond understanding. It is simply out there, a pure presence and no more. © Oxford University Press 2001</page><page sequence="2">16o TRANSCENDENCE IN SHELLEY'S RELATIONAL SYSTEM Power as such has no relationship with man or anything else. Despite Harold Bloom's comments in Shelley's Mythmaking1 and The Visionary Company,2 Mont Blanc as a transcendent Power apparently is not the 'motion' or the 'spirit' of Wordsworth's 'Tintern Abbey'. Nor is it the familiar spirit of the last stanza of 'Hymn to Intellectual Beauty' or the Power in the 'Ode to the West Wind'.3 In 'Mont Blanc' there are two conceptions of Power: an ontological and inaccessible transcendent Power conveyed by the image of Mont Blanc and a Power immanent in Nature with no single definite image but captured in a series of images which are related to each other: 'Power in likeness of the Arve'.4 The mountain as the symbol of the unknown Power is alone and remote and is considered in itself as a presence. It is an immutable essence that exists but is imperceptible. To put it in the context of perception, the mountain should be taken out of its unrelational presence, and placed in the relational context of a sign system. In this case the mountain will not be understood as it exists but as it stands in relationship to its other, which is still nothing but itself looked at from another perspective. Certain attributes of the mountain emerge which insofar as perception is concerned will stand in parallel to each other. One such attribute is the height of the mountain, which stands in its relation to the depth of the ravine. The mountain then will not be understood in itself as a presence but in its relation to the ravine. The relationship is not between two 'presences', but between two attributes or two modes of one being. The height of the mountain is the depth of the ravine. The 'Power like Arve' is an expression of the transcendent Power, emptied of its ontological presence. It is, first, the world of relationships: the river is regarded in its relation to the ravine and its riverbed. The 'universe of things' in the image of Arve is also considered in its relation to the universal Mind in the image of the ravine. Thus, there is no pure presence; everything is considered as a supplement to and in relationship to its other. Second, it is the world of turbulent sounds and voices, in contrast to the mountain's utter silence and solitude. Shelley's favourite image of life and existence is the stream which God-like is the source of 'all that is excellent and delightful' and the Power which models as it flows 'all the elements of this mixed universe to the purest and most perfect shape'/ The image aptly reflects a linguistic experience of what might be transcendent and ontological in origin: For birth but wakes the universal mind Whose mighty streams might else in silence flow Through the vast world, to individual sense Of outward shows ... (.Daemon of the World, II.248-51)</page><page sequence="3">FAZEL ABROON 161 Shelley thus, through the image of the river, establishes a contrast between the commotion, fluidity, and mutability of the world of beings and the serenity of the mountain and the tranquillity of the ocean to which it returns at the end, to begin its cycle once again. Insofar as Power is considered in its relational existence in 'Mont Blanc', things are presented in dichotomous forms, and each is understood in its relation to its other. Power cannot be perceived alone but in its 'likeness of the Arve'. It is the river that can give Power its identity, yet Power is not the river but is in its likeness. There are also the river and the brook, the river and the ravine, the universe of things and the world of the mind. As Coleridge points out, 'there is no action but from like on like'.6 'The river', Frances Ferguson says, 'of necessity, fits the ravine perfectly—and in a way that makes it impossible to say which has priority and determines the other'.7 The universe of things exists because it is perceived by the mind, and the Power is perceived only when it is juxtaposed with beings. Power or Being, as Timothy Mooney comments, 'is not a meaning that commands from a lofty height', but 'emerges from beings and they from it'.8 Nor in the cycle of mutual referentiality, is there a referent that would become the final significance. Thus Shelley reveals modern characteristics in his poem in respect of the absence of final referents and the question of origin in such a way as to make a deconstructive reading of the poem quite plausible. The underlying assumptions of such a reading, as suggested by Karen Weisman, are the absence of a 'stable referent to be finally achieved, and that the poem's deferrals and ambiguity in reference form an aporia which deconstructs Shelley's assertions about the transcendental status of "Power" '. Flowever, this could be valid while Power is textualised or is considered in its relational existence. Certainly Shelley has another view where Power is thought of as transcendent, and, despite Weisman's latter statement, perhaps no deconstruct ive reading can deconstruct 'the transcendental status of Power'; it can deconstruct any final referent in the text but not where there is no text existing: Power in its ontological or transcendent status. Weisman's later qualification of the argument in underlining 'Shelley's desire to realise an articulation of what is thought to be a transcendent presence, or at least a vague intimation of one' is also tentative.10 Shelley, in fact, keeps the two realms of the ontological and the relational separate, regarding one as ineffable and the other effable, never thinking of expressing the former or mystifying the latter. Shelley's perception of the relational Power is based on his theory of metaphor. With regard to the metaphor, he believes, there is no linear movement, which is reminiscent of a one-to-one corresponding relationship between a sign and its transcendent signified, an obvious characteristic of literal facts or dead metaphors. A metaphor constitutes a cycle of dynamic</page><page sequence="4">162 TRANSCENDENCE IN SHELLEY'S RELATIONAL SYSTEM relationship. Through the images of cloud, river, and ocean, and the motion, fluidity, and cyclic repetition implied in these images in 'Mont Blanc' Shelley draws this pattern of circularity. The river ot the 'everlasting universe of things' at the end of its journey 'Rolls its loud waters to the ocean waves' to breathe finally its 'vapours to the circling air' ('Mont Blanc', 125—6). In Prometheus Unbound the same idea is reiterated when Shelley thinks of Existence in terms of one unity where 'all things flow to all' (IV.402). In 'The Cloud' there is a pattern of cyclic repetition in the concepts of 'building' and 'unbuilding' which lies at the basis of the poem, a pattern which Shelley alludes to in his 'Address to the Irish People': 'Do we not see that the laws of nature perpetually act by disorganisation and reproduction, each alternatively becoming cause and effect'.11 It is precisely what the cloud does when: ... after the rain, when with never a stain The pavilion of heaven is bare, And the winds and sunbeams, with their convex gleams, Build up the blue dome of air, I silently laugh at my own cenotaph, And out of the caverns of rain, Like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb, I arise and unbuild it again. (The Cloud, 77-84) Passiveness in Shelley's text could be interpreted as an 'effort' against search and activity as a way characterised by a linear movement for finding the truth, the ultimate signified outside the sign itself He recommends passiveness to remain within the cycle of the sign, the text, and this is how his major characters sooner or later learn to 'act' in their search for truth. Asia does not enter the cave of Demogorgon until she lets 'passiveness' prevail over her senses as she receives the call at the threshold of the cave, the place of prophecy and revelation: 'Resist not the weakness,/ Such strength is in meekness' (Prometheus Unbound, II.iii.93—4). Ironically there she finds what she already had and is told what she knew before. Shelley's other characters like Rousseau, Panthea, and the narrator in Alastor all reflect the idea of knowledge via passiveness and abandonment of search.12 The Poet in Alastor is the only exception who goes actively in search of the 'maid in veil', yet at the end of his futile search he learns to fall passive like a 'fragile lute on whose harmonious stings/ The breath of heaven did wander' (Alastor, 667—8). To return to our subject poem, in 'Mont Blanc', as Ferguson has rightly observed, there is no proper name for the mountain in the first section of the poem. To understand this correctly however, we have to distinguish between a relational understanding appropriately realised in the second person familiar,</page><page sequence="5">FAZEL ABROON 163 and an unfamiliar, impersonal 'it' of the ontological being. Therefore, it does not seem appropriate to think of 'thou' in the second section as if the poem is addressed to the same ontological entity of the first section, or that the name 'Ravine of Arve' or 'Arve' could be related to that entity. Bloom's assumption that the word 'thou' in the last three lines of'Mont Blanc' refers to the mountain-as-the-symbol-of-transcendent-Power does not seem tenable in this context. Unlike the mountain of the first section, which stands inaccessible and solitary, the mountain here, like any other phenomenon— earth, stars and sea—is dependent on imagination, which is a form of perception, and, indeed, as Shelley would say with Coleridge, is perception proper. Speaking intimately of the mountain in the second section, on the other hand, is possible only because it falls within the domain of perception and language. In the first section the mountain remains unknown, separate, and apparently there is nothing to make it an object of understanding, and much less of love. Therefore, the 'thou' of the second section is not, pace Ferguson, 'only one aspect of the poet's effort to convert epistemological language into love language',13 but rather something that converts what lies outside language into a linguistic experience, by turning the ontological presence into relational attributes. There is no possibility of knowing the Power in its transcendence. It is always veiled and disguised by words, by language. 'To be', as John Hodgson writes, 'is indeed to be disguised', and perception is nothing but the knowledge of particular disguises. It is so intertwined with language that nothing can be perceived outside this sign system. As soon as we are a step out of the realm of signs, to use Shelley's words, '[w]e are on that verge where words abandon us, and what wonder if we grow dizzy to look down the dark abyss of how little we know'.15 It is no less wondrous to find out how 'vain it is to think that words can penetrate the mystery of our being!',16 for words themselves are the very veil over being. Hillis Miller here echoes Shelley in arguing that the 'human condition is to be caught in a web of words which weaves and reweaves for man through the centuries the same tapestry of myths, concepts, and metaphorical analogies'. That is why the 'deep truth', unlike truth, which is simply a linguistic issue, must remain unknown. Carol Jacobs is certainly right in believing that 'nowhere and certainly not by way of Demogorgon, can "the deep truth" be voiced as Asia wishes, as a presence, as the present, as here and now that endures', not, of course, that such a presence is non-existent, as perhaps Jacobs would think, but because it is impossible to bring it into words or to find it through words. There is no escape from this prison-house of language. 'Disguise', Hodgson says, 'always lies behind disguise, for ever ready to mock the poet's claim of recognition',19 or as Hillis Miller asserts, the 'most heroic effort to escape from the prison-house of language only builds the walls</page><page sequence="6">164 TRANSCENDENCE IN SHELLEY'S RELATIONAL SYSTEM higher".~° This fact had been attested much earlier by Shelley in thinking of language, the 'wingèd words on which my soul would pierce/ Into the height of love's rare Universe', as 'chains of lead' around the flight of the soul (Epipsychidion, 588—91). There is no escape from the prevalence of signs, as there is no epiphany in the sense of coming to an unmediated vision of an extra-linguistic reality. Thus, Shelley's strategy in 'Mont Blanc' is not to make the Power known in any form or by any means, but to keep it distinct, separate, mute and unknowable: Power dwells apart in its tranquillity Remote, serene, and inaccessible: And this, the naked countenance of earth, On which I gaze, even these primeval mountains Teach the adverting mind. (96—100) Pace Wasserman, Shelley in 'Mont Blanc' does not intend to bring the two worlds of the serene mountain and the ravine together. On the contrary, he keeps them separate and insurmountably different. What he brings together is the height of the mountain and the depth of the ravine, which are two attributes determined in their relationship and not two ontological worlds. What he brings together are the river and its riverbed, and what he makes known are no more than certain modes and relationships. As an example of the descent of the transcendent and its fusion with the world of mutability, Wasserman speaks of the snow covering the peak of the mountain and the glide of the glaciers towards the valley or the ravine. He says: The symbolic scene that has given birth to the poem is splendidly equipped to represent the relation of the transcendent Power to the world of human experience: the gleaming and eternal snow of the mountain peak that symbolizes the inaccessible Power descends as glaciers, which melt into streams that become the river Arve in the ravine." But we have to remember that Shelley primarily thinks of the mountain rather than snow as the symbol of transcendent Power. Snow in this image does not function as synecdoche. Even in terms of propriety of image as a vehicle to its tenor, snow, unlike mountain, is not the image for Power. The glaciers are also related to the Arve rather than to the mountain as their other. The snow becomes the glacier that becomes the river. The mountain remains apart. The transcendent Power, thus, neither descends to the world of beings, nor creates nor produces anything. Peter Butter's remarks on Shelley's</page><page sequence="7">FAZEL ABROON 165 inconsistency, to the effect that he 'contradicts what has gone before' by 'revolting against his own conception of the ultimate power as remote, tranquil and unloving'*"" are also less justified. There is no contradiction in this particular poem insofar as the 'glaciers' which Butter mentions serve as a proof of the emanation of the One. The emanated evil and the destructive elements of the mountain, are, in fact, not related to the mountain, which is the symbol of the inaccessible unknown Power, but belong to the river Arve. The revelation of imagination, on the other hand, does not transcend the world of language. What it does at best is to keep us in the world of metaphor and constant transformation by demolishing reifications and idolatries. Therefore, Wasserman's comment on Shelley's strategy in 'Mont Blanc' that 'by denying the distinction between external and internal, [he] has provided a basis on which dream, or imagination, can ascend to a vision of the total amplitude of Being'*" is only applicable to metaphors, as signs within the sign system. It cannot concern the transcendent being. Shelley is clear as to the identity of the Power that descends to the world of beings. In 'Hymn to Intellectual Beauty' it is the shadow of the Power that descends to the realm of perception and not the unseen Power itself. Karen Weisman is right in her observation that 'the Alastor questor's desire to apprehend "Power" had resulted in a visualisation—in the form of mistaken fantasy—of a projected form for it; the hymn immedi ately insists that the "Power" is "unseen", and that what is apprehended is its "awful shadow", its teasing reminder of an absented presence'." Michael O'Neill likewise identifies Beauty in the 'Hymn' as 'the source of meaning and value in this world' and observes that although the 'poetry preserves the unknowability of the "unseen Power", it hints at experience of its "awful shadow" \25 However, the identity of this descending Power has sometimes been the subject of misinterpretation. O'Neill's comments, for example, on the concluding lines of the hymn seem to me to oifer such reading. Reflecting on the word 'power' in line 78 of the poem, he says: Here, 'power' is seen as an attribute of 'spirit', not as the ultimate principle of the Universe, a reversal of the poem's opening position that suggests the obedience of Shelley's ideas to his feelings. Having established a relationship with Intellectual Beauty, he can now regard its 'power' as available to him through prayer.26 Although the distinction he makes between the two applications of the word Power is right and expected, yet it does not show a reversal in Shelley's attitude nor a sudden submission of the poet's intellect to his feeling. The</page><page sequence="8">166 TRANSCENDENCE IN SHELLEY'S RELATIONAL SYSTEM reiteration of the word in the same poem thus signifies neither the identity of the meaning of the two occurrences, nor necessarily a shift in Shelley's thinking. Shelley, in my view, has not changed his position and he is consistent in thinking of Power as unknowable and transcendent. The Power of Intellectual Beauty is the immanent power of the metaphor, and not the first ontological, inaccessible Power. The visitation of this immanent Power to the world, however, lacks consistency. It visits: This various world with as inconstant wing As summer winds that creep from flower to flower.— Like moonbeams that behind some piny mountain shower, It visits with inconstant glance Each human heart and countenance ... (3 —7) The moment of visiting is what I understand as the moment of metaphor or metaphorical understanding, a reality that cannot be held for long. Once it is captured it is substituted by reifications. And this gives cause to Shelley's nostalgic laments: Spirit of beauty, that dost consecrate With thine own hues all thou dost shine upon Of human thought or form,—where art thou gone? Why dost thou pass away and leave our state, This dim vast vale of tears, vacant and desolate? (13 — 17) I do not think that this nostalgia is, contrary to appearances, for Shelley a logocentric expression of presence, of logos, or a search for transcendence in discourse. On the contrary, it is a wish for escape from reification and anthropomorphism, and a return to the world of relationship and the indefinite metaphor. 'Where indefiniteness ends', Shelley says, 'idolatry and anthropo morphism begin'.- Against this anthropomorphism, reification and the conversion of the metaphor into literal fact, he wishes words to leave aside all their accumulated objectification and stand, as they were, naked before perception: O that the words which make the thoughts obscure From which they spring, as clouds of glimmering dew From a white lake blot Heaven's blue portraiture, Were stripped of their thin masks and various hue And frowns and smiles and splendours not their own, Till in the nakedness of false and true They stand before their Lord, each to receive its due. (Ode to Liberty, 234-40)</page><page sequence="9">FAZEL ABROON 167 As Shelley does not deny the existence of a transcendent Power or an ontological being, he also does not accept any reification or dead metaphor: No voice from some sublimer world hath ever To sage or poet these responses given— Therefore the name of God, and ghosts, and Heaven, Remain the records of their vain endeavour, Frail spells ... (Hymn to Intellectual Beauty, 25-29) The mountain has a voice that can 'repeal/ Large codes of fraud and woe' (80-1). It rejects and denies any penetration into the transcendent being. What appears as ultimate meanings or beings are only dead metaphors and reified linguistic expressions with no presence or beingness. Faith, Hogle observes, 'can be rendered "mild" and thus peaceful in its solemnity, instead of fanatical and oppressive, by refusing to affirm the unqualified or complete adequacy of any one "likeness" (such as the word "God") in which the Power has "come down" '.28 What Hogle here refers to is evidently not the transcendent Power which remains unknown, but is the relational Power or the metaphor which is always at risk of being reified by restricting it to one of the images. The codes thus seem to be nothing other than 'fixed systems with single dominant reference-points that appear to control and deny the very expansive movements between different thoughts and minds which make projections of unity possible'.29 However, Michael O'Neill's claim that the 'unspecificity of "some sublime world" casts doubt on the existence of any such world' might not be true for Shelley. Shelley appropriately speaks of the silence and serenity of the 'sublime world' but not of its 'unspecificity' as O'Neill assumes. And this is quite consistent with the thought of Shelley, who puts the transcendent Power where there is no sign system and beyond expression. Tilottama Rajan makes a similar claim in assuming that 'the final claim for the autonomy of imagination is enigmatic, not apocalyptic. Silence and solitude are, after all, not very different from vacant'.31 Evidently from Shelley's point of view there is a great difference between silence and vacancy. Although outside the text there is no voice, there is still being. Silence is not necessarily tantamount to vacancy, though there is a tradition of Western thought which believes that it is. Moreover, imagination from Shelley's point of view is not the proper medium for perceiving the ontological being which has to remain imperceptible. On the contrary imagination is anti-ontological in the sense that it works on relationships and demands otherness, while insofar as the ontological is concerned, there are no relations and no other. Imagination, therefore, as a means of perception, has nothing to do with being in its ontological existence. The latter remains beyond imaginative perception, as</page><page sequence="10">168 TRANSCENDENCE IN SHELLEY'S RELATIONAL SYSTEM Shelley himself says there is no image that can express this Power: 'the deep truth is imageless' (Prometheus Unbound, II.iv.n6). It is for this that at the threshold of any reflection on the ontological origin of existence, Shelley states, 'we are on that verge where words [as relational signs associated with perception] abandon us'32 and leave the mind in its vacancy. It is important, therefore, to distinguish where and when Shelley drains existence from its presence. Thus, when we hear a critic like Hogle say that Shelley 'reworks the sceptical empiricism of David Hume, William Godwin and Sir William Drummond partly to counter the absolutism that, more and more, seems to dominate the so-called "first generation" of English Romantics', it is important to know which kind of absolutism and where. Shelley, it seems to me, does not reject absolutism outside the domain of language or perception. As his works constantly demonstrate, he does not accept the anthropomorphism presented in religion in its orthodox and traditional form, nevertheless he does accept a Power that is present, remote, and imperceptible. Thus, Hogle is right only if in his statement he has that image of Power in mind which is relational and which Shelley considers as metaphoric, and without any possible absolutism. Hogle has indeed such a conception of the Power when he assumes that it is a natura naturans, 'an impetus, as something that differs from what is visible yet operates through it'.34 He further demonstrates the concept by assuming that Shelley overthrows 'any idea of a Oneness which can be viewed as commanding all transformations from a position completely beyond them'.35 However, Hogle remains silent as to the nature of the Power that 'comes down'. He concludes that 'Power that is transference and "comes down" by way of its own "becoming other" thus cannot be viewed legitimately as an immutable Essence lending an exact and repeatable pattern to whatever it generates'. This form of 'transference', in any case, occurs only within the relational side of existence. Nevertheless, the ontological being does remain 'an immutable Essence'. Shelley's conception of iconisation, it must be said, can only fall within the immanent expression of Power, in other words, within the metaphorical or sign system. And it is this iconisation and deiconisation that gives Shelley's system its dynamic nature and fluidity. Shelley already assumes that unity or integrity of metaphor is not the final, fixed and permanent state; it is replaceable and exists beside and as an alternative to the many, the diversity of the literal facts. Language, which originally is metaphoric, changes into signs for literal facts and significations, into icons, until it is revitalised by regaining its metaphoric state. Shelley says: ... language is vitally metaphorical; that is, it marks the before unapprehended relations of things and perpetuates their apprehension, until the words which</page><page sequence="11">FAZEL ABROON 169 represent them become, through time, signs for portions of classes of thoughts instead of pictures of integral thoughts; and then, it no new poets should arise to create afresh the associations which have been thus disorganised, language will be dead to all the nobler purposes of human intercourse.37 The triumph over literality in any Romantic text is thus short-lived. Sooner or later the many resumes its place as an alternative to the one Life and the oneness assumed to be eternal and inevitable. Metaphors change into dead metaphors or literal facts, and, thus, linguistic conceptions become reified hypostases. There is no prospective for permanent union. 'The verbal signs for union', as Hillis Miller writes, 'necessarily rebuild the barrier they would obliterate. The more the poet says they will be one, the more he makes them two by reaffirming the ways they are separated'. Thinking itself is simply an act of reification, or, to use Coleridge's expression, 'to think is to thingify'.39 If we could speak of poetry and history, in Shelley's distinction, as two expressions respectively for the metaphoric and the literal, one characterised by chaos and timelessness, and the other by time and order, there is always the risk of poetry losing its timelessness in exchange for order and a system. Shelley's belief in the cyclic repetition of history and the continuous fight between Good and Evil is built on this conception of the struggle of metaphoric interpretation against reification and literal perception. Obviously in Shelley's poetry tyrannical systems and benevolent movements represented in social and political reforms intermittently replace each other. This, for example, is evident in the stress that Shelley puts on the thrice-repeated word 'again' when he says: ... and men Were trampled and deceived again, And words and shews again could bind The wailing tribes of humankind In scom and famine ... ... for all, though half deceived, The outworn creeds again believed, And the same round anew began, Which the weary world yet ever ran. (Rosalind and Helen, 703-20) The Eagle in The Revolt of Islam, as the symbol of Evil, is in a continuous fight with the snake, which stands for the Good. Their movement as they fight is a recurrent circle or cycle with no imaginable stop or end. Almost all the words in the following two lines bear the sense of circularity and</page><page sequence="12">170 TRANSCENDENCE IN SHELLEY'S RELATIONAL SYSTEM motion, denoting an unending process of change and replacement of two attitudes: Around, around, in ceaseless circles wheeling With clang of wings and scream, the Eagle sailed Incessantly ... (Revolt of Islam, 1.82-5) Shelley further complicates the situation by choosing equivocal images to represent Good and Evil. Each of the two images can be taken for the other as they traditionally represent the opposite of their present significance. Significantly the Castles of the tyrants in Prometheus Unbound are also left undestroyed after the regeneration, to hint at the possible return of Evil. Demogorgon, perhaps, in the midst of the joy of the newly gained freedom foresees the possible return of Evil and recommends 'Gentleness, Virtue, Wisdom, and endurance' as 'the spells by which to re-assume/ An empire o'er the disentangled doom' (Prometheus Unbound, IV.568-9). Mahmud, too, who could see the decline of his empire and sense the approach of the end of a fading glory, unconsciously lays his finger on this cycle of 'build' and 'unbuild' to hint at the cyclic repetition of history and the intermittent change of Good and Evil. He thus addresses Ahasuerus: Thy spirit is present in the past, and sees The birth of this world through all its cycles Of desolation and of loveliness ... (Hellas, 745-7) This circle is inevitable in the history of man and his perception. Every stage of Good, unity, or metaphoric perception must be followed by another one of Evil, disintegration, and literality. It will be of little advantage to ask 'O cease! must hate and death return?' (Hellas, 1096). Love must give place to hate in its unceasing circling, and Good has to surrender at one time or another to Evil: And the love which heals all strife Circling, like the breath of life, All things in that sweet abode With its own mild brotherhood ... (Among the Euganean Hills, 366—9) But finally and crucially, despite the distinction Shelley makes between the metaphoric and the literal, there is still no dualism in his philosophy: these are</page><page sequence="13">FAZEL ABROON 171 not two languages, but two dimensions of one language. The literal itself is a metaphor, albeit a dead metaphor. Wheeler writes: ... the literal is itself a figure of speech, a dead metaphor ... Metaphor it is, but in its tired, familiar, worn-out phase. No duality exists between the literal and the metaphorical, but only a distinction between rhetoric in its stimulating, integral phase, and worn-out rhetoric which has lost the power to stimulate the 40 imagination. To sum up, Shelley believes in one ontological Power, which is remote, transcendent, and unknown. Perception cannot penetrate the realm of this presence; nor can the latter enter into a sign system. What can be perceived is Power without its ontological being, an immanent Power which is relational and, in Shelley's own terminology, metaphorical, in the sense that it has no one form or meaning, but is dynamic and in constant transformation. Therefore that which is understood as fixed and static Power is neither the ontological nor the relational but a signification of the metaphor turned into a literal fact and so deprived of life.

Panthea in her absolute passiveness experiences the overwhelming presence of Prometheus: I saw not, heard not, moved not, only felt His presence flow and mingle thro' my blood Till it became his life, and his grew mine, And I was thus absorb'd ... (Prometheus Unbound, II.i.79—82) The narrator in Alastor describes the way to knowledge as lying in the passiveness of the soul: Enough from incommunicable dream, And twilight phantasms, and deep noon day thought, Has shone within me, that serenely now And moveless, as a long-forgotten lyre Suspended in the solitary dome Of some mysterious and deserted fane, I wait thy breath, Great parent, that my strain May modulate with murmurs of the air, And motions of the forests and the sea, And voice of living beings, and woven hymns Of night and day, and the deep heart of man.

In another place, in an observation on 'Mont Blanc' Wasserman says: 'the pur pose of the poem is an ascent by means of those illusory realities to a transcendent apprehension which will show to the fullest extent the real nature and signi ficance of the world of existence' (ibid., p. 227). But such a task is neither possible nor could be in any way Shelley's pur pose in this poem, for the illusory world, if we can call it so, is a world with no substance or ontological existence, and constitutes only a series of functions within the sign system; it is a linguistic reality and there is nothing behind or beyond it insofar as language is concerned. Lan guage is the only means of its percep tion, and once removed there is no means left for perception, let alone seeing or understanding the transcendent reality, as Wasserman assumes. The 'illusory realities', on the other hand, according to Shelley, are metaphors with no one fixed trans cendent significance. Veil after veil, he believes, may fall, and yet the meaning remain unexhausted, and, therefore, there is no possibility of such an ascent. Ascen sion in such a sense is possible only where subject and object, or form and meaning are separate, and such dualism is not Shelley's purpose in 'Mont Blanc'. 22 P.
