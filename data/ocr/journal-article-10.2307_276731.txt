The annual floods and mild climate did not encourage well- built, permanent dwellings whose remains would leave a record. In his revision of the pottery types previously de- scribed by Rodgers and by Colton, he introduces a new ware called Lower Colorado Buff Ware, replacing pre- viously described Topoc Buff Ware. Although this is a much more appropriate name, there is a question as to whether it is advisable to introduce a synonym for that reason alone. If such a rule were generally followed, there would be utter confusion on southwestern pottery terms. Since his description of Lower Colorado Buff Ware considers additional types of temper, the new name is probably justified. The author concludes that the valley of the Colorado River below Davis Dam was inhabited about A.D. 900 by an agricultural people who made paddle-and-anvil pottery and were probably Yuman speaking. It appears that the river bottoms were continuously inhabited, except for the periods of the annual floods, until the present time. Shell ornaments showed that the people had trade relations with those on the Pacific coast, and pottery fragments indicate trade with the Hohokam and the people of the plateau. Between A.D. 1100 and 1150, Schroeder believes, the evidence shows that the Sho- shoneans settled in the northern part of the area, dis- placing the previous Yuman inhabitants. HAROLD S. COLTON Museum of Northern Arizona Flagstaff, Arizona. Kiva Mural Decorations at Awatovi and Kawaika-a, with a Survey of Other Wall Paintings in the Pueblo Southwest. WATSON SMITH. Papers of the Peabody Museum of American Archaeology and Ethnology, Volume 37. Cambridge, 1952. xxi, 363 pages, 92 figures, 9 color plates by Louie Ewing. $7.50. Watson Smith's long awaited report has more than fulfilled the expectations of all those concerned with this most important phase of pre-Columbian Indian art. Far from limiting his thesis to the discoveries at the prehistoric Hopi pueblos of Awatovi and Kawaika-a, the author has made it an indispensable compendium of all the literature concerning the mural arts of the entire Anasazi area, from early to late. But though the scores of early accounts confirm the widespread inci- dence of mural painting, the material reported is rarely illustrated, and has been found in such fragmentary condition that it has added little of value to the study of aboriginal art. Thus it was not until 1935 that exca- vations by the University of New Mexico, the School of American Research, and the Museum of New Mexico in the pre-Spanish pueblo of Kuaua, in New Mexico, revealed the presence of twenty-nine successive coats of plaster on the walls of an abandoned kiva, seventeen of which bore elaborate mural decorations (still awaiting publication). There the techniques developed in re- moving layer after layer and in preserving and copying the decorations, showed the feasibility of recovering such treasures and stimulated the search for further finds. The Peabody Museum, in 1936, made similar dis- coveries in its excavations at Awatovi and Kawaika-a, and starting with the technical advice made available by the archaeologists at Kuaua, the Peabody group even- tually perfected a system, made necessary by new con- ditions encountered in the Hopi area. There in the course of four years' work seventeen kivas were un- covered from which an amazing total of 174 mural paintings were salvaged. In the long period since their abandonment, most of the kivas had filled with accre- tions from dumping or by natural hillside erosion. Under such conditions their plastered walls, originally some nine or ten feet in height, had all suffered from the effects of weathering so that the upper margins of the painted surfaces are missing, and gaps are common also in the more protected middle and lower sections of those best preserved. But in so large a group even the most fragmentary parts of paintings from badly deteriorated walls have added to an understanding of the decorative system as a whole. The patience and skill involved in the excavations are shown in one instance by the removal of one hundred successive layers of plaster from one wall, in the process of sal- vaging twenty-seven paintings. The artists had made use of as many as thirteen colors including black and white, of which six or more are usually found in each design. The murals are painted in two-dimensional style. Ob- jects are represented in flat areas of color, each usually outlined with black, or occasionally with white or red. There is no attempt at modelling with light and shade, though rarely a blending of dark color at the edge of a lighter area is done very skillfully by spattering. In only one instance is there a representation of one object partly concealed by another. The paintings are reproduced in figures 40 to 92. As a whole the collotype prints in varying shades of grey give a satisfactory realization of the actual colors but in a few instances certain minute details are lost to ordi- nary vision and need the aid of a magnifying glass, if the reader is to profit by the copious notes accompany- ing each figure. The volume is further enhanced by a group of nine plates of colorful serigraphs by Louie Ewing. These, preceding the collotype series, add greatly to the enjoyment and understanding of the latter. But since the page preceding the serigraphs affords ample space for further information the notes might better have included cross-references to the corresponding paintings in the collotype series, which would greatly facilitate comparison of the two modes of reproduction. One of the serigraph plates (I) is correctly designated as a composite of two sections of the corresponding col- lotype figure but in two others (D, F) obvious restora- tions should have been mentioned. Also supplementing the collotype series are twenty-four line-cut figures con- taining a total of over four hundred drawings of details. 89</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY These, mostly from the mural paintings, include also comparable details from ceramic and textile designs and other Pueblo source material, all well documented in the accompanying descriptive legends. The space devoted to such an exhaustive analysis is more than justified for the series will be of great value in various studies, not only of the Hopi, but of general Pueblo culture. Leaving the attractive illustrations as a background, the reviewer now turns to Smith's text which deserves even greater space. Throughout its 363 pages, inter- spersed with maps, tables, and figures, he presents systematically every phase of his subject from kiva structure to the possible significance of the most prob- lematical objects portrayed by the muralists. His detailed account of the various means employed in repair, re- moval, and copying of the paintings is in itself a veri- table text book for all who may some day be faced (let us hope) with similar problems. Under the section, "Material Characteristics of the Wall Paintings," the investigation of materials and media employed by the mural artists has brought together much needed infor- mation, and particularly that under the head of Pig- ments. But here Smith is misled by conflicting state- ments concerning a commonly used ingredient in Pueblo ceramics, which he classifies as a black pigment. Briefly stated, the boiled, evaporated, and dried sap of beeweed (Cleome serrulata) does harden, like licorice, into a black cake. But when it is redissolved for use it varies, according to its density, from light to dark brown, and when applied to a clayey surface it dries as a slightly glossy, translucent brown. Thus its only use in mural painting would be as a "vehicle or binder" as described, pp. 30, 31. In his analysis of layouts, patterns and design ele- ments the author first assigns his material to four fairly distinct groups, ". . . without regard to time sequence, either known or imputed, but solely on the design features implicit within the paintings themselves." Under these categories he lists and discusses the structural characteristics peculiar to each, and also the objects portrayed. For instance, in Group I we find the extreme of static, bilateral symmetry, while II is characterized by dynamic unbalance. Of I the author says, p. 119: While there is often no close approach to actual detailed sym- metry, there is apparent a very decided and consciously evolved intent to build up the design about a large central figure, and to arrange the minor figures and incidental details around it in such a manner that they will appear in compensation to each other at right and left of the central rhotive. And of II he continues, p. 135: The static rigidity of Group I is quite lacking, and the larger figures, whether anthropomorphic or zoomorphic, are usually in a state of dynamic motion. The placidity and permanence of the figures of Group I, which give many of them the character of a tableau, are quite absent; on the contrary, in Group II the figures seem to be in vigorous movement, even though they may have been momentarily arrested like a moving picture film. Whereas the stories told by the Group I paintings are complete, those of the designs in Group II are, as it were, still in the process of de- velopment. Foremost in human interest are the many remarkable anthropomorphs with elaborate ceremonial costumes and headdress. Next in importance are birds, mammals and other life forms, as well as ceremonial objects, among which stylized feathers abound. Following this comes a most searching presentation of the ceremonial significance of the material in which the author points out the many resemblances to the masked kachinas and unmasked personages surviving in the rituals of the Hopi and other pueblos of today. There follows also a well considered section on Symbolism with a discussion of many unwarranted interpretations associated with the term. Finally in a comparative study of the paintings in relation to the ceramics of the Hopi and adjacent areas, Smith has gathered very convincing evidence of a paral- lel development in the design styles of the two media, the most spectacular of which is that of the Sikyatki and San Bernardo wares. This is further confirmed by tree-ring evidence covering much of the period from circa 1372 to 1630, the apparent date of abandonment of the latest kivas. But, though the mural art extended well into the post-Spanish period, it is purely aboriginal in content, without the slightest trace of European contact. In all, Watson Smith's work is an outstanding contribution to knowledge, not only of prehistoric mural painting as a craft, but also of the many interrelated phases of early Hopi culture, both material and non- material, which the paintings faithfully record.

The Coville rockshelter is in Death Valley National Monument, in the side of a small canyon in the Pana- mint Mountains "roughly halfway between Ubehebe Crater and Ubehebe Mountain" and about 150 feet above the canyon floor. The original limestone cave was about 45 feet across the face and 15 feet deep, but a fall of rocks from the roof before occupation be- gan reduced the available area to about 15 feet at one end and 12 feet at the other. The excavation of the cave was carried out in June and July, 1951, as a cooperative project by the University of California and the National Park Service. The cave is dry and the preservation of materials is good. The entire deposit was removed by trowelling by 6 inch levels and screened through a 1/4 inch mesh. A sterile 24 inch bottom layer was overlaid by occupation material mixed with rocks and dust. This was a few inches deep at the outer edge of the cave increasing to 40 inches at the rear. After the usual introductory materials the report moves to a functional description of the artifacts. The 90 [ 1, 1954</page></plain_text>
