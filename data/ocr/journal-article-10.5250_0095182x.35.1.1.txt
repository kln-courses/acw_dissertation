<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Lost in Confl ation Visual Culture and Constructions of the Category of Religion michael j. zogry Issues of stereotyping with regard to Native American or First Nations  peoples have been the subject of scholarly works from a number of dif- ferent fi elds, and the element of religion often has loomed large in these  treatments.1 Yet even in an era when the general public is acutely at- tuned to such issues, stereotypes of First Nations peoples continue to  be presented in a number of different public contexts, including, as I  will discuss below, European American actors appearing “brownface” or  “redface” in a theatrical production. Perhaps more surprisingly, stereo- types of Native American religions also continue to be presented in se- lected religious studies textbooks, particularly introductory ones. In a previous work I broached the question of how Cherokee people  in North Carolina have negotiated stereotypes of “American Indians” as  part of a long history of being involved in the tourist trade.2 Building on  the idea of resilient images that are at odds with reality yet are imbedded  deeply as cultural tropes, I begin to explore with the present essay how  selected representations resonate with examples from the larger fi eld of vi- sual and narrative tropes that inform academic and popular constructions  of putative First Nations “religions” and “religion.” I am keen to investigate  by what means particular stereotypes continue to prevail and in this con- text consider how general scholarly notions about First Nations religions  may have been formed. Of course, I am not seeking to identify an urtext  containing such imagery in order to pin upon it centuries of concept for- mation. Rather, by investigating the relationship of a chosen set of selected  images to one another, I aim to consider possible marketing strategies, to  invoke the apt metaphor of the cultural marketplace, that have prolonged  the shelf life of these images far beyond their expiration date. </page> <page sequence="2"> I begin with the assertion that Theodor de Bry’s 1590 publication of  Thomas Harriot’s A briefe and true report of the new found land of Vir- ginia infl uenced European readers’ emerging conceptions of “religion”  by selectively presenting customs of First Nations peoples in the form  of highly ramifi ed visual images. The volume featured engravings by  de Bry that were based on theatrum mundi–style watercolor portraits  painted by John White during his 1585 voyage to the colony of Roanoke  on the coast of present-day North Carolina. White’s images depicted  the Algonquian-speaking inhabitants of that region, whom scholars to- day refer to as “North Carolina Algonquians.”3 When Paul Green wrote  his infl uential 1937 outdoor “symphonic” drama The Lost Colony about  the disappearance of Roanoke’s inhabitants, the Pulitzer Prize–winning  playwright drew from these earlier works to create a fanciful scene of  “Indian ritual.” The play continues to be performed seasonally in coastal  North Carolina, on Roanoke Island at the Fort Raleigh National His- toric Site, the location of England’s fi rst settlement in the “New World.”  In 2007–8 a traveling exhibition of White’s watercolors from the collec- tion of the British Museum visited the North Carolina Museum of His- tory, where it was conjoined to a display about the de Bry engravings as  well as an exhibit relating the play’s history. Together, at that moment in time, these works comprised a literal,  physical, and serial confl ation of images. This amalgam of exhibits strik- ingly (and unintentionally) illustrated the way in which, over the course  of more than four centuries, these works have comprised a serial confl a- tion of visual depictions of First Nations practices, identifi ed as “reli- gion,” that has become imbued with powerful cultural cachet. I submit  that though the drawings, engravings, and play describe late sixteenth- century “Indians,” they continue to infl uence constructions of the cat- egory “religion.” This is because such images and the ideological ciphers  that they contain resonate with contemporary authors and audiences;  more broadly, they remain constituent elements of generalized teleo- logical grand narratives of the United States as well as other nations.  Evidence of the contemporary infl uence of these images can be found  not only in The Lost Colony but also in permanent exhibits in major  museums, in textbooks, and on educational websites, as I will demon- strate below. In this article I posit two categories of stereotypes: intellectual and  popular. My analysis hovers around the fault line that divides them, or  2 american indian quarterly/winter 2011/vol. 35, no. 1 </page> <page sequence="3"> perhaps the line that is conventionally supposed to separate them, for  the distinction between the two ideal types quite often is blurred. The  fact that intellectual stereotypes infl uence popular stereotypes is no  great revelation; less frequent are considerations of the reverse. I will  highlight the observable relationship between selected resilient popular  and scholarly representations of Native American religions by discussing  the infl uence of both the White illustrations and the de Bry engravings  upon emerging and lingering conceptions of indigenous peoples, indig- enous religions, and “religion” as a general category. This in and of itself  is not original. As I will discuss below, there are existing publications  that argue for the prominent infl uence of various texts in the shaping of  certain European conceptions of other peoples and their cultures. My contribution is to highlight a particular trajectory that illustrates  the infl uence this particular group of selected images has retained even  into the twenty-fi rst century. Using the outdoor drama The Lost Colony  as the primary example, I suggest, fi rst, that the images of indigenous  people animated by actors in the play are composite, confl ated images  with a traceable lineage and, second, that these images, because of ac- quired cultural cachet, are exemplars of a category of cultural products  that continue to inform discursive constructions of general and spe- cifi c categories of “religion,” both academic and popular. Specifi cally, I  consider the White drawings, the de Bry engravings, the Green outdoor  drama, and the museum exhibitions that presented them as instruments  that have contributed to the continued acceptance (and refi nement,  such as it is) of generalized and impressionistic notions of an “American  Indian religion” or “Native American spirituality.” In the fi nal, most exploratory section of the article, I contend that  there is an observable relationship between scholarly versions of such  notions about First Nations peoples and their religions and acceptance  of a sui generis category of religion in which “religion” is construed a  priori as the presence of an irreducible “sacred” that is by defi nition  universal. This notion of “the sacred” was promulgated by the histo- rian of religions Mircea Eliade, who modifi ed a concept formulated by  the theologian Rudolph Otto. Application of the notion in scholarship  about religion proved critical to the formation of religious studies as an  academic endeavor separate from theology in the mid-twentieth cen- tury. Debate about the utility of the concept is ongoing and character- izes two predominant approaches to the academic study of religions his- Zogry: Lost in Confl ation 3 </page> <page sequence="4"> torically as well as presently: those who accept and employ the category  as a universal, and those who reject it as a viable means for comparison  of different religions and argue for the utility of alternative interpretive  frameworks.4 Beyond White, de Bry, and Harriot (also spelled Hariot in  some sources), the many authors, artists, engravers, and publishers who  relied upon the White drawings and de Bry engravings produced texts  and images that were infl uential in their own right. Many also were en- gaged in broader discourses about “religion,” including the development  of a category of comparison now termed “world religions.” My obser- vation is that the infl uence of this latter general category of religion is  more pronounced in cases where notions about “religion” are being ap- plied to what often are perceived as the tabulae rasae of First Nations  peoples and their religions. As I will demonstrate, this infl uence plus the  unstable borderline between intellectual and popular stereotypes has re- sulted in textbook presentations of the religious repertoires of First Na- tions peoples that strive to categorize them as one large genus by means  of a series of chosen attributes or other idiosyncratic interpretations. picturing religion John White’s watercolors, according to Kim Sloan, the editor of a vol- ume published to accompany the 2007–8 North American traveling ex- hibition, “are now iconic and appear in nearly every book that discusses  early America and its inhabitants.” In turn, according to Ute Kuhlemann,  another contributor to the volume, Harriot’s A briefe and true report of  the new found land of Virginia published by de Bry “is generally cred- ited with having forged the European concept of American Indians un- til the eighteenth century.” Christian Feest, yet another of the volume’s  contributors, asserted that by virtue of de Bry’s engravings, “among the  artists who shaped the image of the New World and its indigenous in- habitants . . . White contributed to the emerging European perception  of American ‘otherness’ like few other artists working before the nine- teenth century.”5 This is despite the fact that “drawings remained largely  unknown until the twentieth century,” having been rediscovered and  purchased at a Sotheby’s auction by the British Museum in the mid- nineteenth century.6 How is it the case that these sixteenth-century images created by  White and de Bry (and the accompanying text by Harriot) have retained  4 american indian quarterly/winter 2011/vol. 35, no. 1 </page> <page sequence="5"> such iconic status? One must begin with the White drawings themselves.  Discussing what she and other contributors to the exhibition volume  termed the theatrum mundi style of White’s watercolors, Joyce E. Chap- lin noted: White introduced Virginia’s natives to the English as if he were dis- playing them in a theatre. . . . [T]he English who colonized Roa- noke, are invisible, even though they were actually interacting with  the natives. . . . [H]e displayed, in dumbshow, certain Indian peo- ple, in certain places, wearing certain clothing and wielding certain  objects—all to make points about their usefulness to an English  plan of colonization.7 Chaplin further remarked that White’s watercolors “are a haunting re- minder of an English fantasy about Indian people who would welcome  and help establish an English colony on their territory.”8 As White indicated on the title page of his portfolio, the watercolors  were “pictures of sundry things collected and counterfeited according to  the truth.”9 Chaplin continued: White shows the Indians as if they were actors in a drama that the  English watched—appreciatively. His experience with dramatic  presentations in London had had an unintended outcome. Vir- ginia’s Indians are allowed to walk on stage only when they agree  to arrange smiles on their faces or hold food in their hands. That  the Roanoke Indians were “counterfeited according to the truth”  made them counterfeit versions of their real selves. But the truth  was that they were entirely consistent with English expectations for  England’s fi rst American colony.10 These expectations included inexpensive colonization, risk taking  only on the part of private business enterprises, “land depopulated of  Indians” available for the taking, and the ability of colonists to keep  their distance from indigenous people, who were “useful, up to a point,  and only if they fi t easily into the colonizing venture.” In sum, the “colo- nists were interacting—peacefully, violently, neutrally—with the Indi- ans, but you would never know it from White’s watercolours.” Chaplin  went on to say that in fact “many of the interactions were so violent”  that “the English and Indians were, after several fatal encounters, in a  wary standoff.” Had White recorded such encounters, this “would have  Zogry: Lost in Confl ation 5 </page> <page sequence="6"> put the lie to all the rest of his images.” However, according to Chap- lin, Harriot’s text did acknowledge “the constant fear and animosity that  accompanied Anglo-Indian interaction, a dark undercurrent that ran  through all narrative accounts but was remarkably absent from White’s  illustrations.”11 Three key points emerge from White’s portrayals of the indigenous  people of Roanoke and de Bry’s subsequent engravings: (1) the “Indian”  is presented as if on a theater stage or perhaps in a zoo, “in his own habi- tat,” with no colonists visible; (2) he is mute as if in a “dumbshow” yet  ripe for signifi cation by means of adornment, accoutrements, and body  movement; and (3) the presentation is immediately recognizable by the  audience and entirely consistent with audience expectations. According  to Feest, “White’s long-term success as an ethnographer appears to rest  fi rmly on his ability to transform specifi c observations into recogniz- able ‘types’ (and/or on the ability of his audience to accept them as such  for more than four centuries). Yet the question may reasonably be asked  what they were ‘typical’ of in White’s own time as well as today.”12 This  dynamic is critical to the maintenance of stereotypes. In his seminal  work on stereotyping, The White Man’s Indian: Images of the American  Indian from Columbus to the Present (1978), Robert F. Berkhofer cited  the signifi cance of the White–de Bry–Harriot triad, asserting that when  Harriot’s volume was published, “in pictures and in Latin, German,  French, and English, Europeans could judge for themselves the appear- ance, the clothing, the government, the religion, the manner of fi shing  and making boats, and the burial customs of the Carolina natives.”13 Furthermore, as religious studies scholar Jonathan Z. Smith has ex- plained, beginning in the sixteenth century there was an expansion of  the use of “religion” as an anthropological category. Smith wrote that  the term religion often was applied by colonists to the activities and be- liefs of others in very specifi c ways during this time: it was “not a fi rst  person term of self-characterization” but a “category imposed from the  outside on some aspect of native culture.” The category as formed was  characterized by an “implicit universality”; it was “thought to be a ubiq- uitous human phenomenon” but based upon what characteristics ap- peared to be understandable, or “natural.”14 One might characterize the process Smith described in the manner  that I did above with regard to White’s depictions. Indigenous people  were observed by the “audience” of colonial protoethnographers, as was  6 american indian quarterly/winter 2011/vol. 35, no. 1 </page> <page sequence="7"> the “Indian,” on a theater stage. They were mute as if in a “dumbshow”  yet ripe for signifi cation, and their “religion” was identifi ed based upon  what characteristics were recognizable by the audience and entirely con- sistent with audience expectations, including the notion that religion  was universal. Admittedly, my own portrait of events is painted with  broad strokes, not unlike Smith’s, but I do so to make the point plain: it  is not hard to imagine that, if the de Bry engravings were being dissemi- nated as this particular category of religion was developing, there was at  least some effect of one upon the other. Additionally, Berkhofer argued that “the modern version of the idea  of progress received its initial formulation during the Enlightenment.” It  is in this context, “in the process of combining past and present into one  history of all mankind that we fi nd the interaction between the contribu- tion of the Indian image to the study of man in this period and judgment  on the Indians as a result of that study.” He contended that “comparison  among societies was the foundation of such a natural history of human- ity,” which “developed from four bodies of comparison: (1) between Eu- ropeans of modern times and the peoples of earlier times, (2) between  modern Europeans and contemporaneous uncivilized societies, (3) be- tween peoples of earlier times and modern uncivilized peoples, and (4)  comparisons among the observable modern uncivilized themselves.”15 Not surprisingly, according to Berkhofer, in period works such as Jo- seph-François Lafi tau’s Moeurs des sauvages Amériquains comparée aux  moeurs des premiers temps (1724), the results of these bodies of comparison confi rmed the funda- mental assumptions that prompted them in the fi rst place: The  beliefs of earlier peoples and modern primitive peoples showed  remarkable similarities; the beliefs and behavior of modern Eu- ropeans differed markedly from those of earlier peoples and con- temporary primitives (except perhaps for some nations’ peasantry  and serfs). Entailed in these comparisons from the beginning and  seemingly proven by the fi ndings was the premise that the present  conditions of primitive peoples could be taken to represent the early  condition of present civilized societies.16 For many philosophers and other writers, then, “the image of the good  and bad Indian came to demonstrate what the life of man was like in the  original state of nature.”17 Zogry: Lost in Confl ation 7 </page> <page sequence="8"> This well-known formulation is evident in another infl uential eigh- teenth-century work, Bernard Picart’s Cérémonies et coutumes re- ligieuses de tous les peuples du monde, a multivolume work published  by Jean Frederic Bernard in Amsterdam between 1723 and 1743. In The  Book That Changed Europe: Picart and Bernard’s “Religious Ceremo- nies of the World” (2010), Lynn Hunt, Margaret C. Jacob, and Wijnand  Mijnhardt concluded that “although it was diffi cult to give good press to  human sacrifi ce among the Aztecs and Incas, Bernard and Picart came  very close to articulating the ‘noble savage’ that Rousseau would ideal- ize thirty years later.”18 What is more, the authors made the bold pro- nouncement in the book’s introduction that Picart and Bernard’s work marked a major turning point in European attitudes toward re- ligious belief and hence the sacred. It sowed the radical idea that  religions could be compared on equal terms, and therefore that all  religions were equally worthy of respect—and criticism. It turned  belief in one unique, absolute, and God-given truth into “religion,”  that is, into individual ceremonies and customs that refl ected the  truths relative to each people and culture. This global survey of re- ligious practices effectively disaggregated and delimited the sacred,  making it specifi c to time, place, and institutions. Once labeled in  time and place, religion became not an unchanging system of be- liefs but a discrete entity concerned everywhere with the gods or  the heavenly.19 Here the authors themselves invoked “the sacred,” though they cited  Dan Diner’s idiosyncratic and imprecise use of the term in Lost in the  Sacred: Why the Muslim World Stood Still (2009).20 Hunt, Jacob, and Mijnhardt identifi ed an explicit link that Picart and  Bernard made between certain forms of Christianity and heathenism:  because they believed them to be analogous in many respects, “the two  volumes on the idolatrous peoples are the longest and most copiously  illustrated in the set.” They acknowledged that Picart relied heavily on  de Bry and, after a section of text in which they discussed this fact, con- cluded that, “in short, Picart’s images, especially when read alongside  Bernard’s text, essentially created the category ‘religion.’” According to  the three authors, “implicitly, the images transformed religion from a  question of truth revealed to a select few of God’s peoples (the Jews,  the Catholics, and then the Protestants) to an issue of comparative so- 8 american indian quarterly/winter 2011/vol. 35, no. 1 </page> <page sequence="9"> cial practices.”21 These statements are striking, and this assessment is no  doubt accurate to some degree, though it very well may be overly gen- erous. Such a claim, of course, is virtually impossible to prove conclu- sively. However, assuming that there is explanatory utility to identifying  key publications in the development of conceptual categories, given the  reliance of Picart upon de Bry’s and, by extension, White’s images, it  seems clear that one could argue that these earlier images had a hand in  the creation of this category of “religion” as well. An immediate question that comes to mind is exactly what category  of religion Hunt, Jacob, and Mijnhardt are proposing that Picart and  Bernard’s work created. I think I have an answer: world religions. For  them, the images in the Picart and Bernard volumes “relativize religious  rituals with an incredible economy of expression,” and all of the images  “suggest some striking answers” to “questions asked, either explicitly or  implicitly, by the text”: Everyone in the world—monotheists and “idolators” alike—has  some kind of religion, and their ceremonies share many character- istics. All peoples, in particular, pay special attention to birth, mar- riage, and death, though with varying levels of participation on the  part of priests and offi cials. Peoples are alike more than they are  different in their attitudes toward religion.22 In a nutshell, this is the classic recipe for world religions textbooks. The authors argued that for Picart and Bernard, the “desire to uni- versalize religious impulses led them to unpack the prevalent stereo- types and turn them against Europe itself.” Later, the authors said that  “if all religions shared certain qualities, then distillation of those quali- ties might reveal a universal underlying religion—or it might reveal that  all religions suffered from the same defects. It might lead to greater tol- eration of religious difference—or to general disbelief.”23 That may be,  though again, such an assertion is diffi cult to prove conclusively. What  is clear is that the notion of sui generis religion is compatible with if  not virtually identical to this characterization of Picart and Bernard’s  viewpoint. On the other hand, Jacques Revel has cautioned against attributing  to texts such as these a formative infl uence upon nascent anthropologi- cal, historical, or religious studies methodologies. He made his dissent- ing comments in a volume of essays about the infl uence of Cérémonies  Zogry: Lost in Confl ation 9 </page> <page sequence="10"> et coutumes religieuses de tous les peuples du monde, edited by the same  group of scholars who authored the above-mentioned book on it: It has often been suggested that the advent in the early 1500s of the  wide-ranging debate regarding the comparison of religions should  be understood as a founding moment for what we now call the his- tory of religion and even for modern anthropology. I am dubious  about such retrospective and anachronistic foreshadowings. They  keep us from appreciating the diverse practical uses of comparison  over time and focus attention on commonalities seen only in hind- sight rather than on the differences revealed by contemporaneous  contexts. I doubt that a single stable use of comparison was avail- able at the beginning of the 1700s.24 Revel also cast his net wider. He chose to compare what he identifi ed  as a set of four representative texts, including Lafi tau’s Moeurs des sau- vages Amriquains, “published for the fi rst time between 1719 and 1724— that is, during the years when Cérémonies et coutumes religieuses was  conceived and began to be published.”25 About these he concluded: Can we trace among these different texts the emergence of a his- tory or anthropology of religions? That is doubtful. Even Lafi tau,  the one with whom modern scholars tend to identify most closely,  combined an innovative analysis with the most traditional apolo- getic and theological intentions. Comparison does emerge in these  texts as a legitimate approach, and it may well have given the di- verse discourses on religion a more realistic and convincing dimen- sion. But it did not endow them with a stable, shared methodology.  At the very moment when religion began to be seen as a legitimate  object of study, those who studied it disagreed profoundly about  both the content and limits of their fi eld of interest.26 Revel’s argument is convincing, and I agree with his assessment re- garding the absence of a shared methodology among texts of the early  eighteenth century. But it does not negate Smith’s assertion quoted  above that a category of religion characterized by an “implicit universal- ity” was being refi ned beginning in the sixteenth century, and several of  the other works cited above bolster this conclusion. Furthermore, any- one familiar with recent debates in the fi eld of religious studies knows  that Revel’s commentary remains valid: those who study religion at  10 american indian quarterly/winter 2011/vol. 35, no. 1 </page> <page sequence="11"> present also disagree “profoundly about both the content and limits of  their fi eld of interest”; there is no single “stable, shared methodology,”  nor has there ever been. There is no question, however, regarding the infl uence of the White  drawings and the de Bry engravings on Paul Green’s play The Lost Col- ony. As I discuss below, nearly the entire second scene of the fi rst act of  the play is a dramatization of a supposed “Indian harvest dance.” The  scene draws heavily on certain details of one of de Bry’s engravings  after White while fabricating other new details, continuing the ongoing  confl ation of White’s original watercolor images while simultaneously  animating key passages of descriptive text White included in his com- positions. It is to consideration of the evolution of this “Harvest Dance”  image that I now turn. relative influence The White image is entitled “A festive dance,” and a miniature version  of it appears in the corner of another in the series of watercolors, a kind  of bird’s-eye view of the town of Secotan. The latter image, “The town  of Secotan,” includes the following descriptive text below the depiction  of the dance (rendered in contemporary English): “A Ceremony in their  prayers with strange gestures and songs dancing about posts carved on  the tops with men’s faces.”27 The original watercolor depicts seventeen  individuals, both male and female, dancing in a circle demarcated by a  series of seven posts with carved faces at their tops. Three of the female  fi gures are in the middle of the circle, locked in an embrace. Markings  are visible on at least one fi gure’s back, and this fi gure also appears to  have tree branches strapped to his back. All are wearing items of cloth- ing, though the bare buttocks of several dancers are visible. The men  appear to be clothed in some sort of kilt or breechclout, and the women  appear to be wearing loose-fi tting dresses. Most of the fi gures are de- picted in movement, with arms upraised and one leg akimbo, hold- ing various objects such as what appear to be gourd rattles, small tree  branches, or arrows. De Bry entitled his version of the image “Their dances which they  use at their high feasts.”28 The engraving presents the fi gures dancing  around the circle in exact reverse order, so that those who appear on the  right-hand side of the watercolor appear on the left side of the engrav- Zogry: Lost in Confl ation 11 </page> <page sequence="12"> ing. Berkhofer stated that the White drawings were “more accurate” than  the altered images in the de Bry volume, which were “more classical in  pose and composition”; Kuhlemann offered that White’s images “were  rather objective,” while de Bry’s engravings were “propagandistic.”29 According to art historian Michael Gaudio, “de Bry belonged socially  and intellectually to a staunchly Protestant, anti-Catholic world.” He  remarked that the work America in its entirety (thirteen volumes pub- lished between 1590 and 1634, of which the Harriot volume was the fi rst)  “has been described by Daniel Defert as ‘the Protestant codex of the  New World.’” Gaudio asserted that while holding “an important place  in the history of the visual ethnography of America, it must also be un- derstood as a massive piece of anti-Spanish, anti-Catholic propaganda,  a ‘machine de guerre,’ as Michele Duchet has called it, in the struggle  for political and religious dominance in both the New World and the  Old World.” Gaudio summarized his view of de Bry’s work as follows:  “Throughout the illustrations for America, we are encouraged to make  the implicit connection between the idolatry practiced by Indians—the  subject of numerous engravings—and Catholic idolatry.” The result is  that “this most visual of the early publications on the New World is also  the most thoroughly antivisual.”30 Gaudio was of the opinion that “de Bry’s linking of American and  Catholic idolatry is at its most explicit” in the “festive dance” image,  “in which Virginia Indians perform an idolatrous dance around a ring  marked by a number of anthropomorphic posts.” He further noted that  when de Bry “appropriated” the image, “the accompanying text tells us  that the Indians dance about ‘certayne posts carued with heads like to the  faces of Nonnes coureed with theyr vayles’ . . . and indeed de Bry’s posts  actually assume a nunlike appearance.” Gaudio attributed this rendering  “perhaps, to a reformed sense of humor—Old World idolaters become  New World idols.” He offered that these depictions and alterations were  but one illustration of “how at the beginning of the Enlightenment an  increasingly scientifi c attitude toward religion continued to struggle with  the visible matter of religion.”31 As I discussed above, this notion is plau- sible but debated, and, as I discuss below, interpreters have continued to  struggle with interpretation of that particular visible matter of religion. In any case, almost immediately upon its release, the de Bry publi- cation became something of a standard template. In The White Man’s  Indian Berkhofer stated that the images in A briefe and true report of the  new found land of Virginia “were thought such fi t illustrations of Indians  12 american indian quarterly/winter 2011/vol. 35, no. 1 </page> <page sequence="13"> in general” that they were used in both John Smith’s The Generall Histo- rie of Virginia, New-England and the Summer Isles (1624) and “in slightly  modifi ed form as late as 1705” in Robert Beverly’s History and Present  State of Virginia. Thus, for Berkhofer, “the heritage of the lost colony of  Roanoke . . . proved to be of two sorts: one, the peril of colony making  in the new land; and two, the classical portrait of the Indian in the colo- nial period.”32 Feest echoed Berkhofer’s comments nearly thirty years later in his es- say for the 2007 edited volume on White’s drawings: One of the most signifi cant developments, however, was the use  of White’s pictures (after de Bry) to illustrate the new Virginia  founded at Jamestown in 1607. Almost all of the illustrative mate- rial printed during the early years of the colony was derived from  White. And towards the end of the fi rst century of the colony, Rob- ert Beverley’s History and Present State of Virginia makes full use  [of] the whole body of de Bry’s engravings. Changes made to ac- count for the difference in time and space were relatively minor,  thus reinforcing the notion of a virtual identity of the native peo- ples of the “old” and “new” Virginia. The compilers of books of  costume and later of ethnography never stopped to refl ect upon  the fact that the two colonies bearing the same name were indeed  two different places.33 Here is clear evidence of confl ation of the indigenous peoples and of the  two colonies in later works. Feest further pointed out: It was by coincidence that Laurence Binyon published his fi rst ac- count of White’s drawings in 1907, the year of the three hundredth  anniversary of the Jamestown colony. In the same year David  Bushnell used three of the drawings to illustrate his contribution  to the commemorations of this event, thus reinforcing the trend  established since the seventeenth century. Largely by default, partly  by tradition, John White’s pictures have thus become nearly syn- onymous with the celebrations of the founding of Virginia in 1607,  offering striking views of—well, not quite of—the native inhabit- ants who greeted Captain John Smith four hundred years ago.34 In fact, as Kuhlemann explained, Smith’s adaptation of de Bry’s en- gravings also included “modifi cation”; the publication distorted “not  Zogry: Lost in Confl ation 13 </page> <page sequence="14"> only the original ethnographical information but also the original func- tion of the engravings.” Smith’s Generall Historie of Virginia (1624) “in- cluded a map of ‘Ould Virginia’ which is surrounded by fi ve scenes using  de Bry’s engravings to illustrate the adventures of John Smith in 1622. . . .  The plate was engraved by Robert Vaughn, and quotes from various  [de Bry] illustrations” were included. Kuhlemann noted one image in  particular: “The scene on the left with the capture of John Smith is based  on de Bry’s ceremonial dance (no. 17). De Bry’s peaceful coastal Algon- quians have been taken out of their context and turned into a more wild  and aggressive tribe.”35 In a book chapter on John Smith and Samuel de Champlain, Gordon  Sayre summarized the composition, editing, and context of this image: The engraver took an image from John White’s depictions of In- dian customs reproduced in the deBry volume, which included  Hariot’s A Briefe and True Report . . . and inserted Smith into the  scene. . . . Although White had represented “A Religious Dance”  and the caption in deBry suggests that it is a summertime fertility  festival, after Smith is grafted onto the scene it becomes a savage  dance of triumph held to intimidate a captive. The dancers who  carried leafy branches and gourd rattles in the original now hold  bows and arrows and clubs. In the White/deBry version the three  fi gures in the center of the circle are “three of the most beautiful  virgins,” whereas Smith and two captors replace them in the Smith  version. The “tall posts carved into faces resembling those of veiled  nuns,” as the caption describes them, disappear from Smith’s illus- tration, replaced by the tree to which the captain is bound in the  image at the bottom of the frame.36 Sayre’s conclusion was that “this manipulated and manipulative image  has been used to perpetuate the idea of American Indians as savage cap- tors and torturers, for it has been adapted several times in illustrations  for volumes of captivity narratives, such as John Frost’s.”37 Thus, this al- ready confl ated portrait had its own effects, and they were far-reaching:  Frost’s Heroic Women of the West was published in 1854. For Berkhofer the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century images were a  result of the “primitivist tradition” that “shaped the vocabulary and the  imagery the explorers and settlers used to describe their actual experi- ences in the New World and the lifestyles they observed among its peo- 14 american indian quarterly/winter 2011/vol. 35, no. 1 </page> <page sequence="15"> ples.” The now “hyperreal” images, to invoke Jean Baudrillard’s apt term,  took on a life of their own: “In turn, the accounts of explorers, mission- aries and other early travelers and settlers seemed to provide the factual  basis and therefore a validation for the primitivistic faith of many subse- quent European writers.” Serial confl ation now raged across the literary  landscape like wildfi re; more and more with each new generation, texts  and images were being “counterfeited according to the truth.” Berkhofer  maintained that these “images of noble Indians” in de Bry’s editions of  Harriot’s volume, as well as those in André Thévet’s Cosmographie (1575)  and Jacque Le Moyne de Morgues’s Brevis narration eorum quae in Flor- ida Americae provincial, “became standard illustrations for texts about  Native Americans for two centuries.”38 It was not until the nineteenth  century, when artists such as George Catlin, Charles Bird King, and Seth  Eastman raced around the Wild West painting images of people who  they imagined were on the verge of disappearing, that the confected im- age of the last of the noble, still wild red men supplanted the “long-stan- dard pictorial image derived from the classical conventions” of de Bry  and his contemporaries.39 However, there is debate about the relative infl uence of the de Bry  images in ensuing centuries. Despite his statement above as to their sig- nifi cance, Kuhlemann also noted that, “although one can fi nd numerous  examples of adaptations of White’s or de Bry’s North Carolina Algon- quians, it is debatable how strongly these images have affected the Euro- pean perception of American Indians.” He believed this is due to the fact  that de Bry’s images did not feature “material riches (gold) and exotic  attires,” particularly “prominent feather headdresses and feather skirts”;  thus, they “did not conform to the emotion-laden European fantasies  and concepts of the American Indian.”40 A fair conclusion is that de Bry’s engravings themselves are generally  acknowledged to have been formative in terms of European conceptions  of First Nations peoples’ customs and that they have exerted a steady  infl uence over time.41 After all, it was the de Bry images that were copied  over and over again, not the White watercolors. And they continued to  be disseminated widely; for instance, selected de Bry engravings were  published in National Geographic at the midpoint of the twentieth cen- tury (vol. 92, September 1947), ensuring that they remained in at least  some portion of the public mind. Today, both the de Bry engravings and the White watercolors con- Zogry: Lost in Confl ation 15 </page> <page sequence="16"> tinue to be featured in museums around the world. For example, in 2008  I visited the Deutsche Ledermuseum (DLM) in Offenbach, Germany,  and the British Museum in London on consecutive days. Both muse- ums have signifi cant collections of First Nations objects, including sepa- rate cases of items from nations in what is now the southeastern United  States. An enlarged copy of the de Bry image “The town of Secotan” was  at the back of one of the glass cases in the DLM display, and the original  watercolor by White was reproduced on a large explanatory placard in  the British Museum’s display of items from that region. This usage suggests that White’s images have had continued infl uence  of their own, and there is other evidence as well. Gaudio reported on  “two reproductions” of them at the turn of the twentieth century, “both  published in American periodicals within twenty-fi ve years of each an- other [sic].” The fi rst was a reproduction of “The Flyer” in an 1882 issue  of Century Magazine “in the fi rst of a series of articles on colonial Amer- ican history by historian and novelist Edward Eggleston”; the second  was of “One of their Religious men” in a 1907 issue of Putnam’s Monthly  in an article by “British art historian and poet Laurence Binyon.”42 As  noted above, by coincidence 1907 happened to be the year of the three  hundredth anniversary of the Jamestown colony. Gaudio was of the opinion that, with the watercolors having been  discovered and sold to the British Museum in 1865, “by providing the  American public for the fi rst time with accurate reproductions of these  eyewitness visual records of sixteenth-century Virginia, Century and  Putnam’s were making up for centuries of degraded copies.”43 Because  “popular nineteenth-century works on American Indians included re- productions removed two and even three times from White’s originals . . .  a direct link to one of the earliest English encounters with native Amer- ica became available once again.” Gaudio continued: “The halftones of  White’s watercolors in Putnam’s made viewers feel that they were seeing  with their own eyes what Binyon called the ‘handiwork of White.’”44 For his part, Eggleston was dogged about using the most accurate  sources possible, providing for his readers “access not to a living pres- ent but to a distant past, to the moment of American colonization,” ac- cording to Gaudio.45 The desire to grant to the general public access  to the moment of American colonization would also prove to be a key  motivating factor for Paul Green. He would write the script for an out- door drama that would not only rely upon the White and de Bry images  16 american indian quarterly/winter 2011/vol. 35, no. 1 </page> <page sequence="17"> for information and inspiration but also be performed on the very soil  where the events of that early colonization occurred. staging the lost colony For nearly three-quarters of a century, The Lost Colony has been per- formed almost every summer on the Outer Banks of North Carolina  just outside the town of Manteo. It is performed in an outdoor amphi- theater appropriately named Waterside Theatre that is perched on the  shoreline of Roanoke Island within what is now the Fort Raleigh Na- tional Historic Site. The drama’s website claims that over three million  people have attended since the inaugural season in 1937; then-president  Franklin D. Roosevelt was one of the spectators during that fi rst year.46  It is my contention that for decades, because the play was and continues  to be presented and perceived as “cultured” or “art,” theatergoers have  invested the portrayals of the indigenous people of Roanoke with much  signifi cance and authority. The play dramatizes the events leading up to the well-known disap- pearance of surviving members of the Roanoke colony conceived by  Sir Walter Raleigh and founded by John White, Eleanor and Ananias  Dare, and others. A two-act play, it was written in the style of classic  Greek drama, complete with a chorus; it also incorporates dance, pan- tomime, and a variety of staging techniques. Author Paul Green dubbed  it a “symphonic drama”: “By symphonic I mean the blending of all the  arts and elements of stagecraft—music, dancing, folk song, choreo- graphic movement, sound effects, pageantry, masks when needed, men- tal speech or what not—all working like the cooperative sections of a  symphony orchestra in moving forward the characterization and story  line of the piece.”47 According to an account written by Green, the idea for The Lost Colony  was hatched when W. O. Saunders, a newspaper editor from the coastal  North Carolina town of Elizabeth City, approached Green about writ- ing the play. Explaining to Green that “he had been in Germany some  months past and had seen the great Bavarian outdoor religious play at  Oberammergau,” he then exclaimed, “Paul . . . we’ve got to have some- thing like that in North Carolina.”48 For those who are familiar with the  Passion play performed in the German village of Oberammergau and  the controversy surrounding it, this is a startling reference. Since 1634,  Zogry: Lost in Confl ation 17 </page> <page sequence="18"> as James Shapiro has noted, “millions of visitors have traveled to Ober- ammergau to see these villagers reenact the suffering, Crucifi xion, and  Resurrection of Jesus, and most have left profoundly moved by the ex- perience.” Yet the town “is also notorious for staging a play—praised by  Hitler himself and sharply attacked by Jewish organizations—that has  long portrayed Jews as bloodthirsty and treacherous villains who con- spire to kill Jesus.”49 Saunders explained to Green that 1937 was the 350th anniversary of  the colony and the birth of the colony’s fi rst child, Virginia Dare. He  excitedly suggested some sort of exposition in which all the Roanoke Is- land residents would dress as they would have during the late sixteenth  century. He also said that they could “move a tribe of Indians down on  Roanoke Island, let them carry on farming, raise tobacco, set their fi sh- ing weirs, just the way they did at the time Sir Walter sent his colony  over.” Settling on the more realistic aspiration of a drama, the two men  held a town meeting in Manteo, North Carolina, some weeks later. The  highlight of the event was when the United States senator Josiah Wil- liam Bailey, unrecognized by the crowd until that moment, rose and  delivered an impassioned speech lauding the proposal. Bailey told the  crowd that “Roanoke Island was the true inspiration for Shakespeare’s  play, The Tempest,” and that Roanoke Island was a “sacred spot.”50 While  Bailey was mistaken on the fi rst count, on the second he was spot on, at  least in terms of the prevailing local opinion, and in years to come that  belief would only intensify.51 The drama debuted on July 4, 1937, and was the focus of national at- tention. As one source noted, no fewer than four federal government  agencies and one philanthropic organization contributed something to  the production, either materially or promotionally: The production attracted national attention from the start. The  theater was built with labor from the Civilian Conservation Corps,  and its major piece of equipment, an organ, was donated by the  Rockefeller Foundation. The Federal Theatre Project supplied ac- tors for the major roles; the US Postal Department issued a com- memorative stamp, and the Treasury, a commemorative half-dol- lar; Brooks Atkinson gave the production a laudatory review in the  New York Times (15 August 1937, sec. 10, p. 1, cols. 1–2; p. 2, cols. 1–2);  and on Virginia Dare’s birthday, 18 August, President Roosevelt  18 american indian quarterly/winter 2011/vol. 35, no. 1 </page> <page sequence="19"> visited Roanoke Island, gave a speech, and attended a performance  sitting in his car. During the summer, over 50,000 people attended  performances.52 A year later Green wrote to the then governor of North Carolina, Clyde  R. Hoey, asking him to block a proposed takeover of the site, on which  the ruins of Fort Raleigh also were located. In dramatic language Green  made his plea: Year by year we wish to make our annual celebration and dramatic  production bigger and better until fi nally it shall become a summer  festival second to none in the world. For the material, the ideal, the  devotion and the dream are here. And someday The Lost Colony  and Roanoke Island will, we hope, stand as high in the world of art  and music as Oberammergau or the Salzburg Festival. Yes, let us  hope even higher.53 That same year Frederick H. Koch, professor of dramatic literature  and the founder of the University of North Carolina Playmakers at  UNC, wrote an essay for The Lost Colony Offi cial Program. Green had  been one of his students, as had Thomas Wolfe. Koch waxed rhapsodic  about the work of his pupil: In The Lost Colony Paul Green has reclaimed the ancient and hon- orable art of pageantry. He has lifted the popular pageant form, for  the most part superfi cial and shallow today, to the plane of imagi- nation and high poetry. . . . I know of no better way toward an  imaginative—a spiritual expression of our American life than by  this popular dramatic form. A notable illustration of the survival  of the medieval religious pageant is the Passion Play of Oberam- mergau in Bavaria which has been intimately cherished through  the centuries, so that today it has become an event of international  pilgrimage.54 Koch concluded: “Perhaps this Roanoke Island drama may show us the  way toward a new theatre—a theatre of all the people—a theatre cher- ished and sustained by a national government as a necessary adjunct  to our spiritual welfare.” The following year, on August 23, 1939, CBS  Radio broadcast a one-hour version of The Lost Colony nationally.55  Again, it is striking that Green and Koch referenced the Passion play of  Oberammergau. Zogry: Lost in Confl ation 19 </page> <page sequence="20"> According to Angela Sweigart-Gallagher, in an 2009 article titled  “The Promise of Democracy: Imagining National Community in Paul  Green’s The Lost Colony,” “the merging of sacred, national, and theatri- cal was not only a refl ection of pageant tradition but also a refl ection of  Green’s interest in creating a North Carolinian Oberammergau. Green’s  play was heavily infl uenced by Oberammergau’s Passion play, which  was as much a civic celebration as a religious one.”56 Sweigart-Gallagher  cited text from the commemorative programs for 1937 and 1938 as well  as critical reviews that dubbed The Lost Colony “the patriotic Oberam- mergau of America” and Manteo, North Carolina, “an entirely secular  Oberammergau.”57 She also cited Dorothy Chansky’s work on North  American Passion plays to make the argument that Green’s play “spoke  to a large imagined community of Americans in both a practical and  spiritual sense,” an imagined community that, as Chansky noted, was  comprised of “Christians of many denominations.”58 Practically speaking, the play needed a regular audience to succeed  year after year, and the focus of the many government organizations, in- cluding local organizations, that became involved was to “reinvent Roa- noke Island as tourist destination for just that purpose.” Sweigart-Gal- lagher argued that the play’s “patriotic message” was the conduit for the  “spiritual aspect” of the play, “which like that of a Passion play speaks  largely to a community of those already converted but does so in a form  that suggests a proselytizing mission.” In this case the “conversion or re- affi rmation of faith” centered on the posited “spiritual connection with  the lost colony.” This connection was “exemplifi ed by a photograph of  a chapel reconstructed on the island by the WPA and an accompany- ing caption printed in the 1937 program. The photograph depicts Saint  George’s Cross and the American fl ag hanging over the altar, and the ac- companying caption suggests that the reconstructed chapel ‘epitomizes  the religious note in the celebration.’”59 The location of Roanoke Island remains quite signifi cant because  audience members now, as they did then, must walk across part of the  small island to get to the Waterside Theatre. For Sweigart-Gallagher,  “reconstructed buildings and their display by the Federal Theatre and  the local historical society transformed Roanoke Island into ‘a ceremo- nial landscape imbued with sacred signifi cance’” on the grounds of  what is now the Fort Raleigh National Historic Site. Thus, “the entire  island, the recreated colony, and the Waterside Theatre melded, mak- 20 american indian quarterly/winter 2011/vol. 35, no. 1 </page> <page sequence="21"> ing each aspect at once a chapel, a national shrine, and a national the- atre in which the lives of the colonists were enacted, remembered, and  celebrated.”60 This notion also was refl ected in Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s quoted  statements included in The Lost Colony souvenir programs for the play’s  fi rst two years: he remarked that “the story of America is largely a record  of that spirit of adventure” and the “fruition of their brave endeavor.”61  As Sweigart-Gallagher observed, his statements “frame the pioneers  as martyrs to the American project”; furthermore, “Roosevelt’s widely  publicized attendance that fi rst year on August 18, the birthday of Vir- ginia Dare, legitimized the production’s national signifi cance.”62 Source after source I consulted while researching this article echoed  the following themes: Green’s John Borden character, the hero of the  play, was the Everyman of the drama. The struggle of the colonists to  overcome the wilderness was to be explained as the spiritual genesis of  the United States—though they disappeared, they did not toil in vain.  As for the indigenous people of Roanoke Island, for the most part they  were either identifi ed with the wilderness or barely mentioned. It was as  if they had dissolved into the melting pot of America. For example, drama critic Brooks Atkinson wrote in the 1937 New York  Times review noted above that “Mr. Green has infused history with a re- ligious reverence for the men and women who laid down their lives to  make Sir Walter’s dream come true.” He continued: “The dances trans- late the freshness and wildness of the new world more eloquently than  words or scenery could. The glory of the ancient English hymns, carols  and ballads, sung to an organ accompaniment, pulls the lost colonists  into the great stream of human nobility.”63 History is thus infused with “religious reverence” for the noble col- onists, whose “ancient English hymns, carols and ballads” distinguish  them from those unnamed characters whose “dances translate the fresh- ness and wildness of the new world.” There are three dances in the play:  a folk dance in Queen Elizabeth’s garden in London (act 1, scene 4);  an English country dance in Roanoke (act 2, scene 3); and the Harvest  Dance, which I will discuss in detail in the following section. For At- kinson, the indigenous people of Roanoke Island were either implicitly  identifi ed with “the freshness and wildness of the new world,” that is to  say, dehumanized, or they simply disappeared. Green himself implied as much in an article included in the 1954 edi- Zogry: Lost in Confl ation 21 </page> <page sequence="22"> tion of the play. Because of its signifi cance, I will quote a substantial sec- tion. Green said of his play: The main thing was the people. For these were the folk of England,  the folk of our race. . . . Flood and drought and hunger are to be  their lot, their minds and spirits a prey to the nightmare fear and  horror of the dark and impenetrable wilderness around them. And yet out of this testing, this straining and tension here on  these lonely shores, this being hammered on an anvil of God, there  must emerge a faith that lies native in them as workers, as believers,  as spiritual beings. . . . Yea, out of this play must come a sustaining  faith, their faith, a purifi ed statement of aim and intent, of human  purpose, or then all was waste and sacrifi ce made vain. And so here on these yellow muted sands of Roanoke Island,  let my hero, John Borden Everyman, speak out in the play on the  night he and his companions are to disappear into the vast un- known out of our sight forever—let him speak the words which  are his credo and our credo as self-reliant and valiant men—“Hear  that once Sir Walter said, the victory lieth in the struggle, not the  city won.”64 Thus, Borden is Everyman—every man, that is, save for the indigenous  people of Roanoke Island, who, implicitly identifi ed with the wilderness,  simply fade into it. During the Federal Theatre Project’s short life in the second half of  the 1930s, according to Sweigart-Gallagher, “outdoor performances were  a hallmark of its attempt to build a ‘people’s theatre’”; such “plays ex- emplify the Federal Theatre’s impulse to use source material from US  history, promote American ideals, and call for a return to the promise of  America’s founding in order to construct a national theatre that would  forge an ‘American’ national identity.” She further stated that the play  “illustrates one way in which the Federal Theatre’s historical and pa- triotic dramas imagined the nation through the staging of American  history, mythology, and ideals, and attempted to establish democracy  as a fundamental characteristic of American national identity.” She also  cited David Glassberg’s observation that “public historical imagery such  as that in The Lost Colony not only has the power to ‘defi ne a common  understanding of experience’; it also serves to help shape culture.”65 Admittedly, “culture” is an elastic term, yet Sweigart-Gallagher’s state- 22 american indian quarterly/winter 2011/vol. 35, no. 1 </page> <page sequence="23"> ments remain useful to my present argument, even if on a more limited  scale. The suggestion is that there was a conscious attempt to “forge” an  “American national identity” and to “establish democracy as a funda- mental characteristic” of it. If one asserts that the imagery in the play  helps to shape culture, surely one can attribute some measure of that  infl uence to the sources of that imagery, in this case, the White drawings  and de Bry engravings. Such imagery, one might also infer, likewise has  played a role in shaping conceptions of First Nations people and their  religions. staging religion Perhaps the theatrum mundi style in which White self-consciously por- trayed his subjects in an artifi cial manner, retained by de Bry, facilitated  Green’s use of the drawings and engravings. In what follows I will review  the scene in the play that I argue most clearly illustrates the infl uence of  these earlier works. This is act 1, scene 2, the bulk of which consists of a  dance, a purported Native American celebration of thanksgiving for the  corn harvest. Before I begin, a few statements are necessary regarding  the available texts of the drama and those that I employ. As one might imagine, over the course of seventy-plus years the  script has evolved; there are several published editions of the script and  numerous unpublished production scripts. The original edition of the  drama was published in 1937, and revised editions refl ecting Green’s  changes to the script were published in 1946 and 1954. In addition, in 1963 the 1962 production script was published as part  of an edited volume, along with an impressive range of supporting doc- uments related to the Lost Colony (both the drama and the colony it- self), and the genre of symphonic drama. Entitled History into Drama:  A Source Book on Symphonic Drama Including the Complete Text of Paul  Green’s “The Lost Colony,” it contained relevant primary historical docu- ments, including excerpts from Harriot’s text and selected examples of  de Bry’s engravings. It also contained scholarly critiques and reviews of  The Lost Colony by drama critics as well as written pieces by Green; his  mentor, Frederick H. Koch; and his student Kermit Hunter, the author  of the outdoor drama Unto These Hills.66 This edition also had one ad- ditional indispensable feature. Using the 1954 edition as a baseline text,  by means of brackets, footnotes, and appendices the editors were able  Zogry: Lost in Confl ation 23 </page> <page sequence="24"> to indicate all signifi cant additions, deletions, and revisions among the  1937, 1954, and 1962 versions of the script. Finally, a revised version of the script was published in 2001, edited  with an introduction and a note on the text by Laurence G. Avery, the  foremost scholar of Green’s work. For this edition, Avery used as his  baseline text an unpublished 1980 revision of the script that Green paid  to have printed and bound for distribution to friends and family. Ac- cording to Avery, “the 1980 text is historically the most accurate and pro- vides the fullest development of characters, action, and theme. It also  represents the last stage in the evolution of the play in the mind of its  author.” This edition of the play was entitled The Lost Colony: A Sym- phonic Drama of Man’s Faith and Work.67 In his introduction to the 2001 edition, Avery provided an extended  discussion of how “the Indians in the play—or indigenous people, or  Native Americans—show how changing social attitudes can affect the  play.” He described various aspects of the drama during the 2000 sea- son, which, coincidentally, was the year I attended a performance.  Avery stated that “from the perspective of 2000 the play in its early years  retained vestiges of the stereotypical Indian associated with dime nov- els and B-movie westerns” and furthermore that “with a rising accep- tance of the humanity of Native Americans in the larger society, the ste- reotypical streak in The Lost Colony weakened the impact of the play  on contemporary audiences.” Still present in the 1980 edition but gone  in 2000 were the demeaning clowning antics of the “Algonquins” that  were once part of scene 2 as well as the pidgin English that they spoke  throughout the play. Remaining in Avery’s 2001 edition was the Harvest  Dance, though he had pared down “overly detailed descriptions of In- dian dances and other gatherings.”68 In what follows I will quote primarily from the 1962 production script  (the 1963 edition), with some references to both older and newer ver- sions. With regard to the scene in question and in particular the dance,  the action specifi ed in this edition seems to be much the same as the  original 1937 edition and adheres closely to the dance action in the pro- duction that I attended in 2000 and that Avery wrote about. Though the  amount of detail in Avery’s edited version of the play is greatly reduced  from earlier versions, the basic actions of the dance remain the same.  And if the videos available at the drama’s website and on YouTube are  any indication, the action of the dance remained much the same as this  article was going to press. 24 american indian quarterly/winter 2011/vol. 35, no. 1 </page> <page sequence="25"> Before discussing act 1, scene 2 in detail, it is instructive to summa- rize the fi rst scene of the drama, because together they comprise the fol- lowing sequence: an “Anglican colonist” ritual, then an “Indian” ritual,  and fi nally a common ritual. The 1962 production notes, unchanged  from earlier versions of the script, state that as the drama begins, an  organ “begins to play a salutation of praise to Almighty God.” A chorus  of around twenty-fi ve men and women in gray vestments sing a hymn,  and as it fi nishes the lights come down on the chorus. At center stage the  lights come up, and “the minister of the occasion . . . stands illuminated  in a circle of light.” Dressed in vestments as well, he offers a prayer, and  the chorus chimes in, alternating with the minister. The minister com- pletes his prayer with the lines, “The dream still lives / It lives, it lives, /  And shall not die!” After another chanted hymn by the chorus that in- cludes reference to the trinity, the minister speaks to the audience. He  says that all are gathered to honor the spiritual birthplace of our nation and to memorial- ize those heroic men and women who made it so. . . . Here these  pioneers of a new order, of a new form of government, lived and  struggled, suffered and died. And in the symbol of their endurance  and their sacrifi ce let us renew our courage and our hope, and by  doing so prove to ourselves and to the world that they did not die  in vain.69 After a comment about keeping faith with them and future generations  “who demand of us that the ideals of liberty and free men shall con- tinue on earth,” he explains that he will leave the rest of the story to the  historian. The historian offers a brief introduction, then concludes with  the comment that the colonists arrived at “the time of the corn harvest”  when “the friendly Indians were celebrating and giving thanks unto  their God.” In the 1962 production script, he added additional informa- tion: the “friendly Indians” were “making offerings unto their god”; the  “god” fi rst makes no answer to their pleas but then gives a sign that there  will be “fi sh in plenty and bounteous crops.”70 The 2001 edition is much  the same, but there is one major difference: the character of the minister  has been excised, and the historian speaks all of his lines. Oddly, Avery  included no explanation of this alteration in his comments. The full title of act 1, scene 2, at least until 1962, was “An Indian Village  on Roanoke Island, July 13, 1584”; the 2001 edition substituted “summer”  Zogry: Lost in Confl ation 25 </page> <page sequence="26"> for the specifi c date.71 The earlier versions of the script also subtitled  the scene “Pantomime and dance,” but this was not included in the 2001  version.72 The dance portion of the scene is all the more remarkable  because it is clearly based upon White’s watercolor drawing “A festive  dance” or de Bry’s engraved version, “Their dances which they use at  their high feasts.” It is at once in the play and in a sense separate from  it. For most of the scene, the English are absent, and the “Indians” are  dancing and gesticulating, and some are even playing musical instru- ments—but in the earlier versions of the script, per the subtitle, this was  all pantomime, or, as Chaplin phrased it above, “in dumbshow.” What is  more, while the earlier versions of the script contain no narration by the  historian during the dance, in the 1962 and 2001 versions the historian  interjects a few interpretive comments about the actions of the dance  for the audience’s benefi t. In the 1962 production notes (again, unchanged from earlier versions  of the script) the “Indian corn god,” an “outlandish fi gure [that] some- what resembles a modern scarecrow,” is described as the center of at- tention. King Wingina, the “Indian chief,” sits among his “several wives”  and “a few half-naked Indian warriors” watching “the antics of Uppo- woc, the wild priest or medicine man, spinning eerily around the idol.”  Uppowoc is a “wizened spindly ancient,” “naked save for a breech-clout”;  on his head he wears “two ears of corn shucks which stand up like big  horns.” He has a red circle around one eye and a white one around the  other, and with a feathered gourd rattle he makes “clamorous gesticula- tions” that cause him to be “bathed in sweat.”73 Dancing by “Indian maidens” and “half-naked Indian youths” follows,  then all gather in a circle around the idol. Next the king and his atten- dants approach the idol, “crawl forward and bow up and down, touch- ing their heads to the ground.” As they do so, “the medicine man goes  around them moving his feathered sceptre mystically over their bent  forms.” Uppowoc then offers several ears of corn “in apparent trepida- tion to the god,” who apparently accepts them. Next the medicine man  “begins prancing back and forth, saying in his gestures that the season  will be bountiful.” At this news all assembled “clamber to their feet” and  “begin dancing wildly.”74 The scene is interrupted by the sound of an English horn, which is  “suddenly and ironically blown.” Uppowoc “stands thunderstruck,” and  then, upon hearing a second horn blast, those assembled run together  26 american indian quarterly/winter 2011/vol. 35, no. 1 </page> <page sequence="27"> and “stand huddled together in fear.” Hearing a gunshot, they then scat- ter into the woods, and the lights dim, then rise on the fi gure of the his- torian. The historian comments: “The simple Indians, fearing the white  men as strange hurtful gods, fl ed at their approach into the dark forest.”  Coaxed out of the woods by two English captains, Amadas and Barlowe,  all assembled at the “Indian palisaded town and swore eternal friend- ship, and Amadas and Barlowe took possession of the land.”75 But this is not the end of the scene. The lights then come back up  on the stage, and the scene plays out as follows: On the right are the  chief and his people, and from the left come the two captains, then a  “priest of the Church of England in vestments.” Behind them march two  soldiers “in gleaming armor, one bearing a cross about eight feet high,  and the other an English fl ag.” Amadas and the chief embrace, and the  chief blows smoke from his pipe “in the four directions of the heavens,  and then across the breast of Amadas.” As they kneel down together  and grasp hands, directly behind them the English priest meets Uppo- woc, the medicine man. The priest opens his Bible over the two leaders,  and the medicine man raises his feathered scepter. Then, after “a short  soundless prayer the priest blesses the kneeling fi gures. But the medi- cine man suddenly and with swift gestures invokes his god to destroy  the spell of the white priest.”76 Gifts are exchanged, and though Uppowoc “menacingly gestures,”  fi nally all “the Indians, including Uppowoc, all kneel to acknowledge the  greatness of the white man.” Uppowoc continues to try and “destroy the  white magic,” as the colonists, led by their priest, kneel before the cross.  The colonists then formally claim possession of the land. Finally, the  historian reappears to complete the scene, noting that “with the English  fl ag planted proudly over a vast domain of wilderness,” the explorers  made plans to return home. He notes that lots were drawn by the In- dians to determine who would go back with them. This was due to the  fact that “many a young Indian brave wished to travel with them in their  strange ships across the ocean to a land of great cities where the white  queen sat on a throne shining like the sun.”77 One can hardly imagine a more effective juxtaposition than placing  the two religious leaders side by side on the stage. Essentially, the fi rst  scene is a dramatized Protestant worship service, with a character, the  minister, offering an invocation and a chorus providing punctuating  hymns. There are other scenes of “colonist ritual” in the play, but as this  Zogry: Lost in Confl ation 27 </page> <page sequence="28"> scene is the fi rst in the play and is followed by the Harvest Dance scene,  it provides the strongest contrast.78 In addition, one assumes that much  of the audience would relate the fi rst scene to worship services of their  own. In the 2001 edition, as I noted above, there is no minister character,  and although there is a “Priest” listed in the cast of characters, no priest  appears in the play. The action of the scenes, however, remains basically  the same. To summarize, the progression of images the audience sees is as fol- lows: First, they see a recognizable Protestant “ritual”—a choir sing- ing and a minister preaching. Next, they see a pantomime of a “Native  American harvest dance,” and the second scene ends with a literal jux- taposition of the two religious systems. In all cases the activities have  been portrayed reverently. Staid, solemn, and formal Anglican ritual is  performed, and the audience recognizes it as such. But what does the audience recognize about the Harvest Dance, per- formed with equal solemnity? Dancers strain their bodies and whirl  about to perform something that is portrayed as a vaguely religious ac- tivity yet ultimately is a contemporary choreographer’s combination of  modern dance movements and odd gesticulations and genufl ections.  The choreographers take their cues from the script notes, and the more  they attempt to honor the activity, the more ironic it becomes. Even  though the 2001 production notes suggest a more serious approach to  the dance, as described it remains just as much an impressionistic in- vention as the previous versions. When I attended a performance of The Lost Colony in 2000, there were  large prints of the de Bry engravings hanging on the walls of the theater  complex. Actors portraying indigenous people of the region wore brown  face and body makeup, to approximate “Native” skin tone, in addition  to various markings such as white and red circles painted on their bod- ies. Men wore breechclouts and had feathers in their hair; women wore  sleeveless short dresses, and some had black braids. The performance I  saw as well as every picture or video I have located of the Harvest Dance  thus far features dancers painted and dressed in this way. The 2000 season playbill also contained a brief unsigned article that,  while noting the stereotypical representations of the Native people as  “warring savages” (as well as the stereotypical portrayals of women),  nevertheless located the play in the grand tradition of public histori- cal drama, thus superseding all other considerations. Despite employing  28 american indian quarterly/winter 2011/vol. 35, no. 1 </page> <page sequence="29"> such stereotypes in the play, the article continued: “Paul Green was a he- roic visionary and in the telling, he speaks of heroic hearts—regardless  of heritage, status, or color of skin.”79 As unconvincing as this apologetic  rhetoric is, one might say that at least there was an acknowledgment that  certain images presented in the play are problematic. However, while the  stereotypes of the individual characters were noted in the article, ste- reotypes of their actions were not. The indigenous peoples’ dances, cer- emonies, and activities of their “medicine man” were not discussed, and  there was no effort to correct the misconceptions. I venture to guess that  the majority of theatergoers were and are not aware of such distinctions,  and perhaps the same could be said with regard to the majority of the  personnel involved in the production. In his introduction to A Paul Green Reader (1998), Laurence Avery  commented that The Lost Colony, as the “fi rst of Green’s outdoor his- torical plays,” “has gained historical signifi cance of its own as the work  largely responsible for reshaping a genre.” He also said that the play dra- matizes the American principle of “equality of condition,” which is “fun- damental to a democratic way of life.” With this play, according to Avery,  Green hoped to “rekindle a feeling for equality, a feeling for its social im- portance, in contemporary audiences.” The play accomplishes this goal  by “showing how frontier conditions in America broke down European  social class distinctions between serf, peasant, yeoman, and nobleman  (and social distinctions between men and women too, for that matter)  and placed all citizens on a level playing fi eld in the game of life.”80 Avery reiterated the idea that the “dream of founding a democratic  society” is “at the heart of Green’s play” in his introduction to act 2 of  the play. He then made the following comment: While the play concentrates on the establishment of a new social  order in the New World, it does not neglect the other side of the  coin—the impact on the people whose land is taken over. The his- torian sets up this line of consideration early in Act I when he in- terprets an Indian dance as a prayer for a good harvest from land  and sea, then adds that the Indians’ “god deceived them. Instead of  plenteous crops and bounteous fi sh from the waters for the years  ahead, these trusting people receive the Englishman.”81 Unfortunately, this is a weak apologetic that collapses under cursory  examination. Given the way the indigenous inhabitants of Roanoke are  Zogry: Lost in Confl ation 29 </page> <page sequence="30"> portrayed in the play as well as various script notes describing how they  should be portrayed, it is not reasonable to argue that this one comment  even begins to address such an issue. Furthermore, these lines did not ap- pear in the original 1937 published script, the 1954 edition, or the 1962 pro- duction script, suggesting that they were a later addition. As I discussed  above, Avery relied on the privately printed 1980 edition of the script for  his 2001 edition. Since his comment above was from A Paul Green Reader  (1998), we can surmise that the lines were in the 1980 script. While Avery did note that this 1980 edition of the play was “exten- sively revised,” in the Reader he did not make the point clear that this  particular comment had not appeared in all editions of the script.82 In  addition, I have found no other related comments in any editions of the  play. I fi nd this attempt to argue that the human rights advocate consid- ered the viewpoint of the indigenous inhabitants to be entirely unsup- ported and forced. John Herbert Roper, the author of a 2003 biography of Green, discussed  the playwright’s touches of humor in the production, including a chorus  that Roper said “is not only not Greek; it is Protestant, indeed Episcopa- lian.”83 He then went on to characterize the Harvest Dance scene: Other religious symbols are signifi cantly used, and there too with  gentle and hidden humor. A Native American corn god is placed  at an altar early, and dance performed in his honor. . . . [T]his icon  is initially humorous, and the humor brushes against racism. The  Christian priest places a cross in front of the corn god, seeming  thereby to bring right reason to things, but it is important that the  audiences never really forget the corn god or the impressive dance  done for him. Indian spirituality, not materialism, has fed the colo- nists and will save them. Behind the cross Green had the colonists  place a Madonna . . . clearly visible behind the cross in the impor- tant scene when leader John Borden is fed soup to be revived.84 Roper said the humor “brushes” against racism, but I think not; it col- lides with it. Throughout his book, Roper highlighted Green’s interest in the phi- losophy of Hegel, as he did in the following passage: What seems to be going on in such settings with these mixed icons  is more Hegelianism. There is here a progression: fi rst the primi- 30 american indian quarterly/winter 2011/vol. 35, no. 1 </page> <page sequence="31"> tive religion, then the more sophisticated, then the most advanced;  that is, corn god, then Madonna, then Protestant cross, and each in  its turn points toward the audience, wherein resides the most ad- vanced possibility of salvation, God’s spirit, or geist, in people. The  physical symbols follow Hegel’s plan, for symbols move forward,  and then up into the amphitheater seats.85 For the biographer, the “Indians” in the play are “not noble savages of  wilderness purity, but humans evolving by cultural interaction” and  “are themselves new, as the historian James Merrill [sic] has noted of  Amerindians.”86 I have to say that I just do not see it, and I doubt that  this would be the general consensus if one polled audience members  either.87 In 2008 the situation remained much the same in terms of the por- trayals of the indigenous inhabitants of Roanoke Island and their  dances. In a February 2008 on-line article from the Virginian-Pilot, Wil- liam Ivey Long, the “Broadway designer who has won fi ve Tony Awards,”  discussed the effort to reconstitute the costumes destroyed in a Septem- ber 11, 2007, fi re at the Waterside Theatre’s costume shop. As he spoke  with the reporter, she described how “a sword, donated by actor Andy  Griffi th, who wielded the weapon when he played Sir Walter Raleigh in  the play, lay across a table strewn with books of costume sketches and  drawings by Elizabethan artist John White.”88 The article continued: The fi re resulted in $2.7 million in losses. Long intends to use the  fresh start to lend “The Lost Colony” more realism. For instance,  the new costumes will more accurately refl ect the way White de- picted native dress in his drawings. Holding up a White drawing of  the wife of an Indian chief, he acknowledges her bare chest. “Un- fortunately—topless,” he said with a playful grin. “I don’t know  what I’m going to do with that.”89 This same “playful” approach to the depiction of indigenous women  was displayed at the 2006 annual Lost Colony golf tournament, in which  two young women, who thankfully were not topless, appeared in brown- face as some sort of mascots for the event.90 The newspaper article went on to quote Long, alluding to movies  about Elizabethan England. Long stated that “in a pragmatic sense, the  American public has become so educated on this era. . . . I think we have  Zogry: Lost in Confl ation 31 </page> <page sequence="32"> a responsibility to the American public to be as historically correct as we  can.”91 What I fi nd most intriguing about this comment is that, as I said  above, the actors were still in brownface or redface. To be sure, educa- tion does seem to be a goal of the production company. For example,  the drama’s website includes a section titled “The Lost Colony’s Educa- tion Pages,” with various resources, including those for educators and  students. Unfortunately, the image at the top of the title page of this  section is a color photograph of the Harvest Dance, replete with actors  in brown body makeup dancing amidst idols. The “medicine man” is in  the center of the whole company, bare-chested, beads around his neck,  jet-black hair, striking a pose with his arms raised and legs spread apart,  bent at ninety degrees at the elbows and knees, holding eagle feathers in  one hand.92 As this article was going to press, The Lost Colony website also in- cluded a page with an embedded 2009 video from YouTube titled “Meet  The Lost Colony—America’s Story!” This was a “two-minute segment  about the production produced by Hampton Roads [Virginia] WTKR  News Channel 3” that featured an interviewer asking then and current  director Robert Richmond questions about the drama. As Richmond  began to answer the interviewer’s fi rst question, the shot faded into a  short clip from the Harvest Dance, followed by other clips from the pro- duction. Midway through the segment Richmond said, “There is some- thing in this show for absolutely everyone,” and once again a clip from  the Harvest Dance faded in.93 After I watched the video, I scrolled through the series of suggested  videos that YouTube’s search engine retrieved. I will summarize the con- tent of and discuss two examples in turn. The fi rst video obviously was  fi lmed from just off stage left. In fact, during the video one can see ac- tors and dancers leaving and entering the stage, one of whom smiles at  the camera. Titled “The Dancers of the 2007 Season of The Lost Col- ony,” it is footage of the Harvest Dance.94 The dance is accompanied by a  soundtrack featuring drumbeats and repetitive chanting punctuated by  eagle cries. During one segment, the dancers can be seen to hold spears,  which they thrust in the ground at the sound of the approaching Eng- lish horns. The dance does seem to be a choreographer’s interpretation  in modern dance but, as noted above, with various impressionistic ele- ments, as were earlier versions noted above. Based on my research I conclude that the decision makers in the the- 32 american indian quarterly/winter 2011/vol. 35, no. 1 </page> <page sequence="33"> atrical company, from the directors to the production designers to the  choreographers, have continued to follow closely the spirit, if not the  letter, of the original stage directions for the Harvest Dance. Though no  clues are given in the scripts that I consulted as to why the dance pro- ceeds as it does, I have found a clue elsewhere. A 1938 magazine article  on the play stated that the “Indian Corn Harvest Dance” was “based on  the green corn dance of the Cherokees.”95 As the study of the Cherokee religious system is one of my primary  areas of expertise, I feel qualifi ed to comment here. The Harvest Dance  bears no more resemblance to the Green Corn Dance than a bunch of  children playing cowboys and Indians does to battles between First Na- tions peoples and Europeans. This is an apt comparison, because in the  end that is exactly what the adult actors are doing, with roughly the  same amount of research involved. The net result is, once again, a con- fl ation of drama with history. The second video clip that I viewed, titled “Oompah Loompahs,” was  shot backstage on what looks to be a rampart off stage left. Only sixteen  seconds long, the clip featured two male and two female dancers in full  body makeup, possibly college age. The posting date was September 14,  2007, and the person who posted the footage wrote: “Our paint came out  a little orange . . . like oompa loompas.”96 The dancers lined up and on  cue started a coordinated movement similar to a row of pistons moving  up and down. At the same time, they sang the “Oompa-Loompa” song  from the movie Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory based on Roald  Dahl’s children’s book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964). Anyone  who has seen the original version of that movie immediately will recog- nize the attempted joke. In the 1971 version the diminutive workers from  “Oompa-Loompa Land” (they were African pygmies in the original ver- sion of Dahl’s novel), who never left Wonka’s factory, had a distinctly or- ange hue to their skin, offset by identical jet-black wigs and bright white  lines painted over their eyebrows—not unlike the get-up the dancers  were wearing. The point is not to criticize a few young dancers from the  production who were having a laugh. Perhaps they felt a bit silly dressed  and made up like that, perhaps they were critiquing the body makeup  and costumes in their own way—who is to say? The critical point is that  while performing in blackface has become a relic of the past, clearly in  this case performing in brownface or redface has not, even during an era  when the public presentation of other such images would spark wide- Zogry: Lost in Confl ation 33 </page> <page sequence="34"> spread outrage. What Rayna Green observed two decades ago still ob- tains presently: while “a combination of non-Black racial consciousness  and Black political power did kill off the offshoots of the minstrel show  and its other blackface cousins . . . the relative disappearance or sub- mersion of American blackface impersonation has meant nothing to the  persistence of playing Indian; the phenomenon has only grown.”97 In the spring of 2010 the MTV television network aired an episode of  a reality show, The Dudesons in America, in which four Finnish men of  roughly thirty years of age attempted to complete a series of actions to  become honorary members of an unnamed tribe. The episode sparked  protest and calls from chapters of the American Indian Movement to  remove the video from the MTV website. In an op-ed for the Santa Bar- bara Independent, Michael Fairbanks, the director of the American In- dian Movement chapter in Santa Barbara, said that the episode “perpet- uates very offensive stereotypes regarding Native American spirituality,  ceremonies, culture and customs.”98 Though MTV apparently had ig- nored multiple previous requests to do so, a check of the network’s web- site the day the newspaper published Fairbanks’s comments indicated  that the video and pictures of the episode had been removed.99 exhibiting the lost colony The 2007–8 British Museum traveling exhibition of John White’s water- colors was limited to only four North American locations. The fi rst stop  on the itinerary was the North Carolina Museum of History in Raleigh,  North Carolina, where it stayed from October 2007 to January 2008. The  title of the exhibit, meant to refl ect that these were in fact two separate  exhibits presented in conjunction, was Mysteries of the Lost Colony and  A New World: England’s First View of America from the British Museum.  The paired exhibits drew an attendance of approximately 58,000 peo- ple in Raleigh.100 This marked the second time the watercolors visited  Raleigh; they had been brought in 1965, the fi rst time that the drawings  had been allowed to leave the British Museum and a year after the Uni- versity of North Carolina Press published a volume of the drawings for  the fi rst time.101 On exhibit with the watercolors were several of de Bry’s engravings  and a hand-colored 1590 German edition of his publication of Harriot’s  manuscript. To this material the museum staff added an exhibit on the  34 american indian quarterly/winter 2011/vol. 35, no. 1 </page> <page sequence="35"> history of The Lost Colony, including an “Indian village” made with set  pieces and other items on loan from the production. While I was not  able to view the exhibit in person, I did speak briefl y on the telephone  with the curator of the North Carolina exhibit and acquired an exhibit  brochure with a map of the exhibit layout.102 The museum also offered  free downloadable podcast tours for visitors to play on cell phones or  MP3 players as they toured the exhibit. The description accompanying White’s watercolor of the “high feast”  or “festive feast” was titled “Stop 9: Festive Dance.” I have transcribed  a portion of it below, but for the full effect one must imagine a female  British narrator. It seems that for some reason we in the United States  are enamored with the British accent; no matter what the speaker is say- ing, the accent immediately accords authority, wisdom, and classiness to  the comments: This exuberant celebration clearly has some religious signifi cance  [here the narrator described the image]. . . . It’s an intriguing and  rather mysterious image, and we don’t quite know what’s going  on. What do the poles with the carved heads represent? Who are  the three fi gures in the center? The couple holding hands in the  foreground? The religion of American Indians clearly interested  White and his patrons. . . . But if at fi rst this seems terribly pagan  and alien to Protestant English tastes, think of Morris dancing and  the springtime capers around the Maypole. This still takes place in  English villages today. There’s something here for potential inves- tors, and colonists in England, to identify, even sympathize with.  The New World, White suggests, is not as alien as it might fi rst  appear.103 The narration simultaneously and paradoxically asserted that the  “celebration clearly has some religious signifi cance,” though the image  is “intriguing” and “mysterious” and “we don’t quite know what’s go- ing on.” The message, quite remarkable when one stops to consider it,  seemed to be that “we are certain that it is religion,” but “we don’t have  to know exactly what it is to know that it is religion.” Over four centu- ries after its creation, the image remains freely available for signifi cation.  Jonathan Z. Smith’s contention cited above that beginning in the six- teenth century the developing anthropological category of “religion” was  characterized by an “implicit universality,” “thought to be a ubiquitous  Zogry: Lost in Confl ation 35 </page> <page sequence="36"> human phenomenon” but based upon what characteristics appeared to  be understandable, or “natural,” appears to retain at least some degree of  applicability in the contemporary context.104 Apparently, the exhibition at the North Carolina Museum of History  was somewhat cutting edge. In an article titled “Staging Meaning: Per- formance in the Modern Museum,” Valerie Casey identifi ed an exhibi- tion model that I think Mysteries of the Lost Colony and A New World  illustrated. As Casey explained, “conjoining the scholarship associated  with curatorial analyses and the surface dressing that is normally the  domain of interior design, the exhibition interprets history and engages  visitors through narrative sequence, harmonizing authentic historic ar- tifacts with facsimiles that are guaranteed to elicit a reaction.” In this  context the impact of the objects is heightened: “Objects—authentic  and reproductions—are mnemonics that trigger collective cultural  memory. Bracketed by the aesthetic, intellectual, social, and physiologi- cal techniques of exhibition design, the interpreted museum object per- forms cultural ideology.” Casey further commented that “storying and  sequencing combine with entertaining reenactments and re-creations  to orchestrate the museum’s didactic mission in a highly refi ned theat- rical manner.” Museum visitors are equipped for this drama because,  according to Casey, the “cult of the individual engendered by the 20th- century consciousness of self has cultivated a new type of viewer who is  accustomed to spectacle and its sometimes dissimulating effect.”105 She  continued: Rather than being passive receptacles of edutainment, the post- modern viewer demonstrates awareness of the choreography of  museum performance, and participates in the spectacle by circu- lating its image. . . . The visitors read the social codes and signs  so well that they know exactly how to select the (Kodak) moment  that will be instantly recognizable to friends and family. . . . The  particularity of the viewer’s experience now becomes a general  marker; the image-making renders the visitor the director of her  personal stage-set as she re-appropriates and inverts the usual mu- seum frame.106 I simply am not convinced that this was the case at the North Carolina  Museum of History, at least not for everyone who viewed the exhibit.  Though a disclaimer was posted at the entrance to the “Indian village”  36 american indian quarterly/winter 2011/vol. 35, no. 1 </page> <page sequence="37"> section of the exhibit informing visitors that this was not intended to be  an ethnographically accurate display, I contend that the presentation of  these images and objects side by side would have been quite signifi cant  for museum visitors, in that each segment reinforced the cultural cachet  of the others. It is an interesting question to consider to what degree dif- ferent visitors discerned difference between the display about the play  and the rest of the exhibit, especially since they were presented together  in the state history museum. Furthermore, the exhibition also presented a concrete illustration  of what I have asserted is a serial confl ation of images. Such juxtaposi- tion illustrates the way in which both The Lost Colony as a play and Paul  Green as a playwright have achieved a certain cultural status, at least in  North Carolina. Once again, the net result is, in my opinion, a confl a- tion of drama with history. converging stereotypes While as noted above the scholarship on Native American/First Nations  stereotypes is voluminous, including a signifi cant amount of work re- garding both fi lm portrayals and team mascots, there is signifi cantly  less scholarship (at least thus far located) on such stereotypes in theater,  particularly twentieth-century theater.107 Berkhofer’s The White Man’s  Indian: Images of the American Indian from Columbus to the Present,  though published in 1978, remains an excellent primer on the general  subject. At the heart of his project, Berkhofer traced the genealogy of what he  termed the “scientifi c or anthropological image of the Indian,” which  as he said is “fundamental to modern White understanding of Native  Americans.” Also considering imagery in art, literature, philosophy, and  US government policy, Berkhofer argued for a “curious timelessness in  defi ning the Indian proper,” noting further that “in spite of centuries of  contact and the changed conditions of Native American lives, Whites  picture the ‘real’ Indian as the one before contact or during the early pe- riod of that contact.”108 John White’s “pictures” of “real” Indians during  the early period of contact quite literally both illustrate and complicate  Berkhofer’s point. As for why such imagery has been so resilient, Berkhofer offered the  opinion that “since Whites primarily understood the Indians as antith- Zogry: Lost in Confl ation 37 </page> <page sequence="38"> esis to themselves, then civilization and Indianness as they defi ned them  would forever be opposites. Only civilization had history and dynamics  in this view, so therefore Indianness must be conceived of as ahistorical  and static.”109 Other scholars, including Vine Deloria Jr., Leah Dilworth,  Lisa Aldred, and Wendy Rose, have made related observations.110 Vine  Deloria Jr.’s concise observation that “Americans simply refuse to give  up their longstanding conceptions of what an Indian is” is still relevant,  even if not quite so broadly applicable as it once was.111 Similarly, Berk- hofer observed that “most whites still conceive of the ‘real’ Indian as the  aborigine he once was, or as they imagine he once was, rather than as  he is now.”112 Note that none of these quotations distinguished between  popular and academic notions of First Nations peoples. Another work of note is Thomas C. Parkhill’s Weaving Ourselves into  the Land: Charles Godfrey Leland, “Indians,” and the Study of Native  American Religions (1997).113 Parkhill considered the stereotype of the  “Indian” in relationship to the study of First Nations or Native Ameri- can religious traditions, identifi ed several modes of stereotyping, and  provided commentary by Native American scholars on its negative ef- fects. He also made extensive use of Berkhofer’s earlier work. Accepting Berkhofer’s notion of two aspects of the “Indian” stereo- type, Parkhill envisioned hegemonic cultural apprehension of Native  Americans as if there were two “Disney-style ‘life-like’ humanoid ro- bots” on a revolving stage of a game-show set. One is a “good Indian”  and the other is a “bad Indian,” and non-Natives control the button that  shows one or the other to the audience, the hegemonic culture. Parkhill  then continued: “In other words, the needs that determine which of the  whirling images appears on stage at any given moment are those of the  hegemonic popular culture, not those of Native Americans whose reali- ties are by and large misunderstood or ignored.”114 Though now mech- anized and robotic, these are the same imagined Indians signifi ed by  Lafi tau, Picart and Bernard, and Rousseau. A more recent work that has joined this discourse is by Philip Jenkins,  Dream Catchers: How Mainstream America Discovered Native Spirituality  (2004). The thesis of the book is that “through the early twentieth cen- tury, a growing admiration for the primitive can be traced in religion,  as well as art and culture.” Increased tourist travel, interest expressed by  “the celebrated group of writers and artists from the bohemian circles  of Taos and Santa Fe,” and fi gures such as Carl Jung and John Collier  38 american indian quarterly/winter 2011/vol. 35, no. 1 </page> <page sequence="39"> resulted in cultural ascension: “By 1900, Indian religions had become  familiar; by 1920, they were presented as national treasures, part of  America’s cultural patrimony.” The interest continued such that “during  the 1920s and 1930s, Native spirituality established itself in the American  consciousness as a valid religious tradition. . . . In the early 1930s, books  sympathetically presenting Indian culture and beliefs were appearing at  a rate that would not be matched again until the 1970s.”115 Jenkins subsequently tracked the interest in Native American spiri- tuality, now a generalized category, through several “periods of disaf- fection with Western and specifi cally American culture,” including the  Great Depression, the late 1940s, and the late 1960s through the late  1970s. The “social and political stresses” that lasted until the late 1970s  “provide the essential context for understanding the emergence of the  New Age movement in the decade after 1975, a far-reaching cultural and  religious phenomenon in which Indians would once again be central.”  Jenkins argued that despite “a growth of awareness, a greater sensitivity  to the nature of Indian practices, and a praiseworthy willingness to see  these cultures more in their own terms . . . at every stage, non-Natives  were using a good deal of imagination in creating their Indian stereo- types.” Contemporary stereotypes, though “much more attractive fi g- ures than the primitive savages of Victorian fantasy,” continue to present  First Nations peoples’ “ideas and actions . . . according to the tastes of  the mainstream non-Native audience, and are not necessarily any closer  to any objective reality.”116 Whatever the reason, the stereotypical images remain; to reiterate,  my aim in this article is to isolate a mode by which these conceptions  continue to have resonance in contemporary popular and academic  contexts. One cannot explain the persistence of stereotypes without  considering how they are maintained in different times and circum- stances. In the introduction to his book, Parkhill stated that stereotypes  are different from generalizations; they are “far more rigid” than gener- alizations and are “held with an emotional intensity born of some need  that makes alteration diffi cult and retraction agonizing.”117 No group  has more trouble altering and less interest in retracting than academics. Tomoko Masuzawa, in The Invention of World Religions: Or, How Eu- ropean Universalism Was Preserved in the Language of Pluralism, recon- structed what I consider to be the “prehistory” of another such stereo- type: “world religions.” Masuzawa argued that “the 1920s and early 1930s  Zogry: Lost in Confl ation 39 </page> <page sequence="40"> mark something of a watershed” in the widespread and common us- age of the term world religions. It was also during this time period that  “something closely resembling today’s world religions courses began to  appear in college curricula in North America.” By the 1930s, according to  Masuzawa, “something like a standard list of ‘living religions’ had come  into existence.” Remarkably, as she pointed out, this “list of eleven reli- gions—or twelve, if we include ‘primitivism’ . . . remains essentially un- changed today, more than seven decades later.”118 Signifi cantly, Masuzawa highlighted the same period that Jenkins  did in his study. During the 1920s and 1930s, as the concept of world  religions began to gain cultural traction in both academic and popu- lar contexts, the generalized category of Native American religion was  assuming a position on the US mantelpiece of religions. To be sure, it  could be a coincidence, but as I have argued throughout this article, I  do not think so: at critical junctures, images of First Nations religions  consistently have been employed in delineations of a universal concept  of “religion.” Masuzawa began the introduction to her provocative book with the  observation that “everybody, in effect, seems to know what ‘world reli- gions’ means, more or less, that is to say, generally, vaguely.” Furthermore,  “it is presumed . . . that religion is one of the most signifi cant—possibly  the most signifi cant—factor characterizing each individual society, and  that this is particularly true in ‘premodern’ or otherwise non-Western  societies.” For Masuzawa, the study of religion has remained “largely  unhistoricized, essentialized, and tacitly presumed immune or inher- ently resistant to critical analysis,” such that at present it possesses “the  kind of overwhelming sense of objective reality, concrete facticity, and  utter self-evidence that now hold us in its sway.”119 Whether or not one  agrees with her rather generalized assessment of the fi eld of study, she  does draw attention to a signifi cant relationship between characteriza- tions of “religion” and characterizations of “other” societies, especially  “premodern” societies. I think this latter category easily can be trans- posed to “indigenous.” Masuzawa asserted that though these characterizations “are mostly  precritical, unrefl ected assumptions on the order of street-corner opin- ions . . . when it comes to the subject of religion, it appears that the  scholarly world is situated hardly above street level.”120 I understand and  agree with her point of view regarding the synergy between the two pos- 40 american indian quarterly/winter 2011/vol. 35, no. 1 </page> <page sequence="41"> ited bodies of opinion but disagree as to the value judgment she makes  about them. While to be sure there are “street-corner” as well as “schol- arly” assumptions that are “precritical” and “unrefl ected,” saying that  “most” overreaches a bit; I would argue simply that some do, others do  not. The point is, for better or worse, ivory-tower academic opinions  about religion can and often do mirror the ground-level prevailing vul- gate of any particular historical moment. Intellectual and popular ste- reotypes can be linked closely. Hunt, Jacob, and Mijnhardt argued a related point in their introduc- tion to The Book That Changed Europe. They maintained that in the con- text of the European Enlightenment, “advances in the world of learn- ing cannot be uniquely attributed to a small elite of intellectuals and  scholars whose ideas then slowly percolate from the top to the bottom  of the social pyramid. Discovery, whether in science, naval exploration,  or humanistic investigation, required (as it still requires) an enormous  army of personnel.”121 In other words, seminal concepts, formative theo- ries, and new evidence, in short, paradigm-shifting information, does  not always rain down from the ivory tower of academia. As often as not,  cheesecloth, rather than brick and mortarboard, separates popular and  intellectual viewpoints, as the two textbook examples below illustrate. teaching religion In this fi nal section, I present selected text from two recent religious  studies textbooks to support my argument that certain scholarly as- sessments of First Nations or Native American religions, as well as of  a generalized “American Indian religion” or “Native American spiritu- ality,” often are rooted in a sui generis category of religion, itself often  wedded to a “world religions” model. My purpose in citing these two  works is not to play a game of “gotcha.” Both textbooks have useful fea- tures and approaches to the academic study of religions. Nor am I say- ing that scholars who employ other approaches are necessarily immune  to applying such characterizations. I see my commentary as an update  of sorts to a 1994 article by James R. Lewis titled “‘Living Fossils’: Evolu- tionary Images of American Indian Religions in World Religions Text- books.” In addition, over the past several years the Religious Studies Re- view has published extended reviews of available textbooks.122 My fi rst example is Introducing World Religions (2008) by Victoria  Zogry: Lost in Confl ation 41 </page> <page sequence="42"> Urubshurov. In her introduction, Urubshurov cited the work of Ru- dolph Otto and Mircea Eliade and provided individual sections focused  on Eliadian concepts (“Hierophany and kratophany,” “the sui generis na- ture of religion”). This material was balanced by several pages of text  offering contrasting views of the subject matter, including quotations  from Russell T. McCutcheon, Bruce Lincoln, Jonathan Z. Smith, Leila  Ahmed, and Edward Said. Urubshurov defi ned religion as follows: “A  religion is a dynamic cultural complex with positive or negative impact  that stakes a claim to legitimacy based on a foundational connection to  reports of hierophany.”123 Urubshurov also posited a questionable distinction between “literate”  and “expressive” traditions.”124 The second chapter is titled “Expressive  Traditions of Oceania, America, and Africa.” The author said that she  would highlight ten traditions and that the chapter could provide only a glimpse into the religious lives of the many distinc- tive peoples who live in these three vast areas. Yet despite their va- riety, the indigenous peoples of these regions are alike in two cul- turally signifi cant ways: (1) They created expressive traditions that  center on the performative aspects of religious life rather than on  a corpus of sacred literature. (2) They became vulnerable to the  powerful economic ambitions of European colonizers—many of  whom worked hard to convert aboriginals to the Christian faith.  Because the indigenous peoples of Oceania, America, and Africa  emphasize the expressive (non-literate) aspects of religion, they  are treated here in terms of the ten elements of performance.125 Assertion number two, while general, is for the most part accurate, but  assertion number one, to which she returns at the end of the passage, is  not only a simplistic, general, and static characterization, it is just plain  wrong. On the same page was a picture of an unidentifi ed person, alone,  attached by thongs to a small tree and pulling away. Entitled Prayer, the  picture’s caption read: “The ceremonical [sic] cottonwood tree is re- garded as a living being that sustains those who sacrifi ce themselves in  the Sun Dance. In the intense heat the tree transmits the cooling mois- ture it collected at the stream while it grew. This scene captures the spirit  of Native American prayer.”126 Thus all indigenous religions, and then  on a narrower scale all Native American religions, are essentialized. In Rethinking Religion: A Concise Introduction (2005), Will Deming  42 american indian quarterly/winter 2011/vol. 35, no. 1 </page> <page sequence="43"> defi ned religion as follows: “Religion is orientation to ultimate real- ity.” In a chapter titled “Primal Religions,” the author acknowledged the  “plurality of religious traditions” but chose to focus on “fi ve broad pat- terns of orientation that are common among primal religions” rather  than specifi cs, because “these religions are small and mostly unfamiliar  to Western readers.” He later summarized, “From their vision of the cos- mos as a connected whole, adherents of primal religions often seek out  symbols that orient them to ultimate reality by positioning them at the  ‘center’ of all reality.” He also noted that “instead of being linear or his- torical, as in modern societies, time in these religions is primarily cycli- cal” (though he did qualify the statement somewhat).127 The latter two  statements belie the infl uence of Mircea Eliade. As these two examples illustrate, I propose that there is a potential  connection between utilizing the notion of the “sacred,” by defi nition  irreducible, and constructions of various religions, including First Na- tions religions. Unable to articulate specifi city in such contexts, the con- cept of sui generis religion can inform depictions of Native American  religions that are equally irreducible or, as some observers might say,  impressionistic or vague in nature. At any rate, my sense is, to repeat  my statement from the beginning of this article, that the infl uence is  more pronounced in cases wherein general notions are being applied  to what often are perceived as the tabulae rasae of First Nations peoples  and their religions. Judith Weisenfeld has argued that “we must understand the contest  for the very right to defi ne what constitutes religion as situated in a  fi eld of other categories in process, including those of ‘modern,’ ‘primi- tive,’ ‘American,’ ‘foreign,’ ‘man,’ ‘woman,’ and ‘white.’” In a discussion of  “Hollywood imaginings of African-American religion,” Weisenfeld com- mented that “the cumulative effect of constant picturization of this kind  is tremendously effective in shaping racial attitudes.”128 She concluded: Such projections of black religion have participated in the mainte- nance of racial hierarchy and in the process of defi ning American  religion in ways that explicitly marginalize—politically, socially,  and religiously—forms of religiosity linked with blackness. Never  simply inconsequential entertainment, American fi lm has been a  vitally important arena for inculcating understandings of racial- ized religion, both for Americans and for audiences of American  fi lms around the world.129 Zogry: Lost in Confl ation 43 </page> <page sequence="44"> I argue that White’s watercolors, de Bry’s engravings, and The Lost Col- ony have served such a function with regard to conceptualizations of  First Nations peoples and their religious systems or cultural repertoires. The portrayals of Uppowoc, King Wingina, and all the other North  Carolina Algonquian characters in The Lost Colony have been altered  over time; they no longer speak broken English, for example. However,  key elements of the imagery from the 1937 production remain. Perhaps,  like Shylock in Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice, these characters  will be debated but not removed from The Lost Colony due to what is  perceived as the artistic and historical signifi cance of the work. Yet an- other reason they likely will remain is that the images still resonate with  the audience members, as the laughter and gasps from children and  adults alike in the audience expressed the night in 2000 that I attended.  Such resonance, and the concomitant refusal to give up such imagery,  likewise is refl ected in controversies over the past several decades sur- rounding nicknames, logos, and mascots of such teams as the Washing- ton Redskins, the University of Illinois Illini, the University of North  Dakota Fighting Sioux, the Cleveland Indians, and countless other high  schools and colleges. As I have suggested in this article, that these im- ages continue to resonate within contemporary popular culture is po- tential evidence of the effect that intellectual and popular stereotypes  have upon one another. Finally, I maintain (bearing in mind Jacques Revel’s critique) that the  White watercolors and the de Bry engravings were sixteenth- and sev- enteenth-century tools in a fusion of the emerging anthropological im- age of the Indian with the emerging anthropological notion of religion.  This experiment produced resilient Frankensteinian amalgams that have  ambled around the cultural landscape for centuries, infl uencing count- less later cultural products such as Paul Green’s The Lost Colony, which  subsequently acquired cachet of its own. In such situations any coherent  historical sense of a particular community of people and their cultural  traditions, indigenous or not, is lost in confl ation. Let us hope that this  will not always be the case. notes 1. In this article I employ the terms Native American and First Nations inter- changeably to delineate peoples of the present-day United States; at times I uti- lize the term indigenous as well. I do not mean to confuse readers, and frankly, I  44 american indian quarterly/winter 2011/vol. 35, no. 1 </page> <page sequence="45"> do not think that most readers of this journal are confused by this usage. It re- fl ects scholarly and popular usage of such terms, which is all over the linguistic  map. I recognize the conventional usage as well as the utility of the distinction  the fi rst two terms have provided to refer to peoples of the present-day United  States and Canada. I also am well aware of the debate regarding the pros and  cons of all these terms and others commonly used. I use the terms interchange- ably for two main reasons. First, at present the term First Nations is employed  by a number of university student organizations in the United States, including  the University of Kansas, where I teach. The term also is used in other contexts,  from First Nations Day in North Dakota to names chosen by other organiza- tions, cultural centers, and archives. This may signal a more general shift in us- age, though Native American is still widely employed as well. Second, indicat- ing that the indigenous inhabitants of North America formed the fi rst nations  of people on the continent applies equally well to communities in the United  States and Canada. It also is consonant with a range of theories about how the  continent may have been populated and accentuates the point that there are  nations that both predate and straddle the current international boundary be- tween the United States and Canada. For a valuable discussion of this matter  that appeared in this journal, see Michael Yellow Bird, “‘What We Want to Be  Called’: Indigenous Peoples’ Perspectives on Racial and Ethnic Identity Labels,”  American Indian Quarterly 23, no. 2 (1999): 1–21. As Michael Yellow Bird’s title  asserts, people have a right to verbalize what they would like to be called. This  is so even if they don’t all agree on the same name. In my scholarly work, when- ever possible I use the proper name or designation of individual nations or peo- ples and then use other general terms when appropriate. 2. Michael J.

While I cannot comment on this characterization with regard to the Hakluyt  volume, all the BAE volumes were purchased by most university and many  other libraries and thus would have had a circulation that, while not approach- ing that of the periodicals, would still have been signifi cant. 43.

The biographer made no note of this, though elsewhere  in the text he was quite frank about Green’s views about Jewish people. Though  Green chose to study Jewish folk theater at one point in his life, “plainly put,  Green was prejudiced against Jews,” and there is ample evidence in his diaries  attesting to this viewpoint (Roper, Paul Green, 113). Roper discusses this anti- Semitism in some depth here and elsewhere in the book. He noted that late in  life Green used “white-out” on a typescript copy of his diary in an attempt to  edit out remarks about Jews but did not attempt to change the handwritten  originals (Roper, Paul Green, 113).

Berkhofer, White Man’s Indian, 29. 113. Parkhill, Weaving Ourselves. Focusing on the work of Charles G. Leland,  Parkhill described how he collected, retold, and altered the traditional story of  Kluskap and Malsum to fi t his own ideas about how it should unfold. This strat- egy both obscured the original meanings of the narratives and fostered stereo- typical images of the Maliseet, Micmac, Passamaquoddy, and Penobscot peoples.  Inhabiting northeastern North America, these four groups all are Algonkian- speaking peoples. This is a common project; Sam Gill’s Mother Earth and Ray- mond J. Demaille’s The Sixth Grandfather are two of the most well known ex- amples. What makes this work different is attempts to mend bridges between  Native American and non-Native scholars in the fi eld. At times it veers into self- absorbed refl ection, as Parkhill tells the reader he has become emotionally in- vested in the debate. He also introduces a notion of geopiety to express what in  Zogry: Lost in Confl ation 53 </page> <page sequence="54"> his terms is the innate longing in all humans for a sense of place. Current and  former non-Native inhabitants have been drawn to various Native American  traditions, and more frequently to a perceived general class of activities, because  they see in them a way to connect with this continent, since they do not feel an  innate connection to any “Place.” He called for scholars of religion to “admit  our sidelong glances at these religious traditions have always been rooted in re- ligious needs” and to “overtly and honestly” explore those needs (148). 114.

Here  Jenkins included quotes taken from reviews of John Neihardt’s Black Elk Speaks,  published in 1932. Jenkins said of Jung and Collier, “Such fi gures would be deci- sive in publicizing Native religious grievances and in helping the Indians to vic- tory during the religious freedom debates of the 1920s. Collier, that antimodern  utopian mystic, became the overlord of federal Indian policy during the New  Deal years” (18). For information on the religious freedom debates, see, for ex- ample, Tisa Wenger’s book We Have a Religion: The 1920s Pueblo Indian Dance  Controversy and American Religious Freedom (Chapel Hill: University of North  Carolina Press, 2009), which situates the debates of the 1920s in the broader dis- course regarding the concept of religion. 116.
