Mechanical Engineering Dept. ABSTRACT Applications of modern technology make it possible for handicapped people confined to wheelchairs to travel in vehicles in both driver and passenger modes. This is consistent with the trend of increased independence and mobility for the handicapped confined to wheelchairs . Concurrent with this trend is the devel- opment óf wheelchair restraint devi ces /systems to restrain the wheelchair and provide the wheelchair occupant some measure of protection in normal and abnormal (crash) driving situa- tions. The proliferations of these devices, some of which afford minimal restraint to the wheelchair occupant, led representatives of the Texas Transportation Institute and the Mechanical Engineering Division of the Texas Engineering Experiment Station (TEES) , with the funded support of the Veterans Administra- tion (VA) , to conduct a program to test and evaluate representative restraint devices currently being marketed. This paper describes the progress that has been made in this program to-date. Included are the descriptions of the test facility, photographs of some of the actual impact tests and the description of a new restraint system that is under development. HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT SINCE 1972, research has been conducted at the Texas A&amp;M Research and Extension Center in four key areas of automotive adaptive equip- ment for handicapped drivers: 1. primary vehicle controls for providing braking, throttle, and steering inputs, 2. secondary vehicle controls such as head- lights, wipers, parking brakes, etc. 3. wheelchair lifting devices for ingress and egress from motor vehicles, and 4. wheelchair restraints. Research into the fourth area of wheelchair restraints began in 1976, under contract to the VA, and culminated in a static testing and evaluation program patterned after the Federal Motor Vehicle Standard No. 207 [!]*• Four tests were formulated to evaluate the performance of the wheelchair/wheelchair restraint system in static loads derived from a deceleration environment of 20 g's. The intent of these tests was to simulate the inertial loading of impact environments. From these tests, as applied to the generic types of restraints on the market (fender clamp, T-bar, rim-pin, frame clamps), it was concluded that every restraint evaluated performed in- adequately and that lack of structural integrity of the typical manual wheelchair should not be considered a valid reason for failure of a given restraint to perform satisfactorily. Other general conclusions follow: 1. The manufacturers of wheelchair restraint devices appear to have very limited know- ledge of the types and magnitudes of forces that the restraint may be subjected to in actual use. 2. Appropriate performance standards for wheelchair restraints should be adopted and reflected in State and Federal Law. 3. Adequate installation and operating instructions should be required to accompany all wheelchair restraints sold. 4. Only one restraint purchased specified a seat belt (type 1 belt) for the wheel- chair occupant. All wheelchair restraint devices sold should include a satisfactory belt restraint as an integral part of the wheelchair restraint system.

Additional dynamic tests are required be- fore final approval is given to a partic- ular wheelchair restraint system. Based on these recommendations and the serious implications of the test results, VA funded the herein described program in 1979 to dynamically evaluate current generic wheelchair restraints and develop occupant protection systems. Whereas the program at Texas A&amp;M was and is concerned with the transportation of wheelchair bound individuals in personal licensed vehicles, other agencies began similar research efforts in the multi- modal transportation of the the handicapped, e.g., public transit systems, minibuses, school buses, see [2,3,4,5,6]. It appears that dynamic testing has become the medium for restraint evaluation. As summarized in the National Workshop on Wheelchair securement in Vehicles [7], "... dynamic testing is the only method that can evaluate how a system may perform in the real world. . . . the human body which is simulated through crash dummies, has a very complex response in a dynamic situation, which static loading can not simulate. A complex interaction between the mass segment of the passenger's body, such as a whipping motion, takes place. A whipping motion can result in what a par- ticipant called acceleration amplification, ...for example, if there is an impact at 16 g's, some parts of the body may exper- ience 60 gfs.,f IMPACT TEST FACILITY The impact test facility at Texas A&amp;M Research and Extension Center is designed to simulate a vehicle crash environment. Based on the FMVSS and impact data from manufactur- ers, the design requirements for the facility are to: 1. achieve speeds up to 48 km/h (30 mph) and deceleration levels up to 30 g's, 2. carry payloads (wheelchair, dummy, and restraint) of up to 1.78 kN (400 lbf) , 3. produce impact deceleration time histories which are programmable (predictable) and repeatable to simulate various types of vehicles, 4. be able to simulate either the driver position of a van with a steering wheel and dash or a passenger position with several feet of clear space in front of the passenger, and 5. provide sufficient data to determine whether restraint /occupant protection systems meet their goals. The dynamic test facility is made uo of four basic subsystems. These include the dropweight system for accelerating the sled, the sled itself, the impact barrier, and the instrumentation system. DROPWEIGHT SYSTEM - Figure 1 is an illustration of the dropweight and pulley sys- tem used to accelerate the sled. The purpose of the pulley system is to increase the tòt al sled travel over that of the dropweight , and hence, decrease the sled acceleration required to achieve a given impact velocity. The mass of the dropweight acquired for use in the facility is approximately 1811 kg (124 slugs). iTo Dropweight Moving ļļ^ļļ PULLEY Block I . _ SCHEMATIC t&gt;^1) I 6 REDUCTIONS Fixed i I Block d = = h &lt;"} d h sPvUsLtLImY oropwoght ( n REDUCTIONS) . = ===.

In order to configure the pulley system and determine the total sled travel required for a desired impact velocity, several factors must be considered. The sled acceleration? for example, will be a function of the number of reductions in the pulley system (n) and the weight of the sled (ws) . Since the sled weight will vary as different restraint systems are tested, the desired pulley configurations may vary. Defining W to be the weight of the dropweight (17.8 kN or 3990 lbf) , the sled acceleration, Ag, may be shown to b.e V[(- n2ws)jg (D where g is the acceleration due to gravity. Since the sled acceleration is constant, the runup distance (xR) necessary to achieve a desired impact velocity (vj) may be expressed as ? s While these relationships are straight forward, their implementation is hampered by several design constraints. One constraint, for example, is the physical length of the present track. This limits the available runup distance (xR) to 13 m (43 ft) although plans have been make to expand the length to 20 m (66 ft). Another constraint on the design is the allowable sled acceleration. In order to keep the wheelchair and test dummy from moving out of position, the sled acceleration must be kept below 0.8 g. The plot illustrated in Figure 2 represents a graphical means of implementing the relation- ships in equations (1) and (2) without viola- ting the stated design constraints. For exam- ple, if a certain restraint system is to be tested at an impact velocity of 40 km/h (25 mph) , appropriate values must be chosen for the number of reductions in the pulley system (n) and the runup distance (x^) . Beginning with the sled weight (including wheelchair, dummy, and wheelchair restraint) we may refer to the plot in Figure 2. After locating the sled weight on the left horizontal axis, we move vertically until one of the curves, indicative of the pulley reduction, is intersected. If the intersection lies below the cross-hatched area then the sled acceleration will be acceptable. For this example the acceptable values of n are 5,6, and 7. Choosing n=6, we move horizontally from the intersection and find that the sled acceleration will be approximately 0.65 g. Continuing horizontally, we locate the curve that represents the desired 40 km/h (25 mph) impact velocity. If the intersection of this horizontal line and the impact velocity curve lies in the cross-hatched area to the right, the required runup distance will exceed the available track. Since this is not the case here, we move straight down from the inter- section point to find that the required runup distance is approximately 10 m (32 ft) . In this manner the test engineer can quickly determine an acceptable pulley configuration and runup distance for the desired test. It should be noted that the curves shown in Figure 2 represent an idealized system with no energy lost to non conservât i ve forces. After several test runs, it was determined that the energy loss due to friction could be reflected in the design chart by shifting the curves corresponding to pulley reduction down slightly.

SLED - The sled shown in Figure 3 is de- signed to withstand impacts at velocities up to 56 km/h (35 mph) and to simulate a typical vehicle interior with a dash and an energy absorbing steering column, Figure 4. Since vehicle occupants confined to wheelchairs often travel as passengers in vans or small buses, there is room at the rear of the sled to mount a restraint system in order to simulate the effects of an impact on a passenger in a van. A 50th percentile male anthropomorphic dummy weighing 734 N (165 lbf) is used to simulate the wheelchair confined individual, whether in the driver or passenger position. The sled rolls on light weight, low inertia aircraft tires and is guided along the track by steel guide bars. IMPACT BARRIER - The barrier design shown in Figure 5 provides a sled deceleration prof- ile that closely resembles the deceleration profile experienced by typical unit body construction American made vans in crashes at 48 km/h (30 mph) , Figure 6*. Note that this profile is a pseudo-envelope or band of the actual acceleration data within the frequency range specified for impact tests [8]. The actual response is highly nonlinear and composed of acceleration components at various frequen- cies . Figure 5. Impact Barrier *We cannot give the source of this acceleration envelope for proprietary reasons by request of the automobile company spoke s- man. The kinetic energy of the sled at impact is dissipated in the strain energy associated with strap bending as a metal strap is pulled through a series of rollers. Most of this strain energy is in plastic deformation, leav- ing little elastic energy for impact rebound. Conceptually, this design has real potential for simulating actual crash environments. In addition, it is advantageous because of its potential repeatability and low cost. The final barrier design utilizes two sets of three identical, vertical rollers of radius r separated by a distance 2£s&gt; Figure 7. The strap bending occurs around the four inside rollers as the strap is displaced by the leading nose of the test sled which is a solid half cylinder of radius R. The final design incorporates a barrier having an R=178 mm (7in), r=25 .4 mm (1 in), and &gt;£s = 0.6m(2ft) INSTRUMENTATION - Accelerations of the head, chest, and sled along with impact velocity of the sled and loads in the femurs and re- straint belts are recorded simultaneously during ing a test, Figures 8 and 9 . The velocity is recorded just before impact by the infrared device in Figure 10. The characteristics of the thirteen data channels and the placement of the sensors carrying this information are tabulated in Table 1. Each data channel con- forms to SAE Recommended Practice- Instrumentation for Impact Tests- SAE J211b [8]. Referring to Figure 11, the transient wave form recorder sam- ples the filtered signals at 10,000 samples per second (which exceeds the SAE J211b recommendations) and records 4096 ten bit words for each sampled data channel. This digital data is then trans- ferred directly to a minicomputer for reduction and nonvolatile storage via an IEEE488-1975 di- gital interface. Typical waveforms from various tests are shown in Figures 12a and 12b. Figure 12a is the sled de- celeration in a nominal 40 km/h (25mph) impact. Figure 12b is the head X acceleration (frontal direction) of a nominal 32 km/h (20mph) impact in which the dummy was restrained by a lap belt only and the head impacts a hard interior surface (the dash) . RESTRAINT EVALUATIONS - To- date, approximately thirty impact tests have been run on the impact facility. Three generic types of wheelchair restraints currently being marketed have been evaluated in various con- figurations and at different impact speeds with type 1 (lap belt) or type 2 (lap and torso belt) restraint belts. At the minimum a lap belt is required to retain the dummy during impact .</page><page sequence="6">WHEELCHAIR RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 3611 Figure 6.

Typical Impact Tests Waveforms</page><page sequence="10">WHEELCHAIR RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 3615 Before we consider the results of these impact tests, let us review the wheelchair re- straint devices currently on the market, their various configurations and those deficiencies in design which should be apparent from visual inspection. Confirmation of these deficiencies and the revealing of others not so obvious will then follow. WHEELCHAIR RESTRAINT DEVICES Most wheelchair restraint devices are de- signed primarily to prevent the wheelchair and wheelchair occupant from moving excessively in a transportation situation. Restraint of the wheelchair and not the wheelchair occupant is the usual focus of most designs. Restraint of the wheelchair occupant, if at all, is accomplished by secondary restraints such as type one or type two belts attached to either the vehicle structure, wheelchair frame members, or restraint structure or to some combination of these. To understand the challenges facing designers of wheelchair restraint devices and the deficiencies of the designs currently being marketed, we must first understand the inherent deficiencies in the wheelchair itself when substituted for the seating normally found in transportation vehicles . Referring to Figures 13, 14, and 15, we see that the wheelchair has a tubular frame composed of 1. two "backrest11 members, 2. tubular members lying in two vertical planar frames which bound each side of the wheel- chair seat, providing arm support and sufficient strength to support the attach- ment of the wheels, and 3. two cross-members, see Figure 14, arranged to provide lateral shearing stiffness and designed to make the wheelchair portable (the type shown is collapsible) . The wheelchair seat and back are padded vinyl attached at discrete points to the tubular structure. Foot rests attached to the front tubular members of the wheelchair add little structural strength to that of the main struc- tural configuration which we have described. Portable wheelchairs- of the kind shown have a total mass of approximately 23-27 kg (weigh- ing approximately 50 - 60 lbf) and are com- posed mainly of 2.22 cm (0.875 in) diameter steel tubulär members each having a cross-sectional area of approximately 0.84 cm^ (0.13 in^) and a moment of inertia of 0.46 cm^ (0.011 in^) . Performing P/A and Mc/I calculations, the implication of these numbers is that axial loads exceeding 10 kN (2200 lbf) or bending moments exceeding 8600 N*cm (760 in* lbf) in any member may deform that member. The results presented later demonstrate that this may occur in even moderate impact situations, depending on the duration of the g loading and the manner in which the dummy and wheel- chair are restrained. Wheelchair reátraints are usually designed to "secure" either the wheels, or frame tubular members; some designs may reinforce the wheel~ chair side panels by adding more stiffening mem- bers or plates. In addition, designs vary as to the number of attachment points, usually from one to four, possibly more if wheelchair occupant restraint belts are included as a part of an overall restraint "system" The three generic types described in this paper - rim-pin, T-bar, frame- clamp - comprise the most used and successfully marketed restraint designs. The rim-pin design restraining the wheels of the wheelchair in Figure 13 consists of two vertical, T-shaped, thin-wall structural members attached to the floor of the transporta- tion vehicle via a base flange (two bolts per structural flange) . The wheelchair must be moved back against the restraint members until each wheel enters a structural slot and can be retained by two horizontally sliding cross- pins. During the motion dynamics of transporta- tion, the cross-pins prevent the wheelchair from moving forward while the structural slots prevent the wheelchair from rolling backwards. Lateral sliding of the wheelchair can occur if the motion dynamics cause lateral forces which exceed the static friction forces between the wheels and floor. Obvious deficiencies of the rim-pin design are the placement of the attachment points since the wheels açe the weakest structural members and the inherent compliance of the attachment design- a pin to a rolling member. Shown deformed after an impact test in Fig- ure 14, the T-bar restraint attaches, by two pressure points, the two lowest horizontal mem- bers of the wheelchair to the horizontal member of the T-bar which is located under the cross- members of the wheelchair. Structurally, the T-bar has only one vertical member to withstand any loads transmitted to it. This member is designed to be compliant so that by passing the vertical member through a hole in the floor the flexible lower part of the member can elon- gate under high loads. A notable deficiency, this restraint is much too compliant, providing little resistance to any twisting of the wheel chair. In a transportation situation both the operation of the rim-pin and T-bar restraints require the assistance of a steward and are operationally incompatible with the needs of those handicapped who desire independent per- sonal mobility. In contrast to the costs of the rim-pin and T-bar restraints (hundreds of dollars) , the frame clamp restraint may cost several thousand dollars. This design, see Figure 15, is switch operated, hydraulically actuated, and intended primarily for those disabled drivers who must remain in their wheelchair while driving. In- stallation requires extensive modification to the vehicle floor before the restraint substruc- ture can be lowered into place. In addition, stiffening plates and attachment rods are added to the wheelchair to provide attachment points</page><page sequence="11">3616 E. RED, ET AL. of sufficient rigidity. Upon positioning the wheelchair on the re- straint structure the switch is activated causing the wheels to be lowered; simultaneously, securement hooks attach themselves through appropriate kinematics to a rod on the modified wheelchair. We note that seatbelts attached to the wheelchair reinforcement plates are included as part of the restraint system. Deficiencies of the design do not become obvious until impact tests are conducted. RESTRAINT IMPACT TEST EVALUATIONS As mentioned earlier, ... dynamic testing is the only method that can evaluate how a system may perform in the real world. .". The results of the impact tests which we summarize demonstrate the usefulness of conducting physical simulations when complex nonlinear interactions between physical systems occur. Tables 2,3, and 4 summarize the test results thought to be most pertinent for each of the three generic types tested: rim-pin, T-bar, and frame clamp, see Figures 13, 14, and 15, re- spectively Although there are other generic restraint devices on the market, these three are among those most commonly used. Three general types of tests have been con- ducted: frontal impact tests at 32-40 km/h; rear impact tests at 32 km/h; side impact tests at 32 km/h. In reality, the impact speed has varied slightly from these nominal values. As can be discerned from the information in Tables 2-4 and the discussion in the following sections, none of the generic types of restraints provided occupant protection for impacts in the three directions. RIM-PIN EVALUATION - For the rim-pin restraint, using the results of the tests com- pleted to-date, we can conclude that the rim-pin structure does not provide occupant protection. Other conclusions are: 1. In frontal collisions the rim-pin structure retains structural integrity. It is at- tached to the weaker members of the wheel- chair (the wheels) which cannot withstand the dynamic loads generated at impacts above 38-40 km/h unless type 2 belts (lap plus torso beltts) are attached to the sled to react against the dynamic body load: note the wheel deformation in Figure 13. 2. The rim-pin restraint is particularly deficient in rear collisions At 32.8 km/h the wheelchair and occupant rotate backwards over the restraint in a severe excursion mode actually causing the oc- cupant to impact the sled floor upside down, Figure 16. 3. In side collisions at nominal speeds of 32 km/h the wheelchair's significant lateral weakness is revealed since signi- Table 2.

T-BAR EVALUATION - It was only necessary to conduct two tests with the T-bar restraint device because of its poor performance in the dynamic crash environment. The T-bar configuration tested was designed to have some extensional compliance which, in our opinion, proved detrimental to its performance because the T-bar permitted significant excursions of the wheelchair (over 15 cm) even with type 1 and type 2 seatbelts restraining the occupant. With a type 1 seatbelt attached to the sled, the T-bar ruptured at the nominal impact speed of 40 km/h and released the wheelchair at the lower frame attachment points, see Figure 14. FRAME CLAMP EVALUATION - The manufacturer of this restraint specified a type 1 belt as a part of the overall restraint system. A considerably more expensive restraint than the other two, this restraint was found to provide better occupant protection. Unfortunately, this generic type still fails to qualify as an occupant protection system because: 1. This restraint is primarily designed for wheelchair occupant drivers. Since the manufacturer has specified only a lap belt, it does not protect the occu- pant against jacknifing which subsequently leads to head impacts with the vehicle steering wheel, window, and dash in frontal collisions. 2. The restraint does not protect the wheel- chair occupant in rear collisions because there is currently no design provision to reinforce the back of the wheelchair. In a rear collision at 30.9 km/h the dummy tore through the back of the wheel- Figure 19. Frame Clamp Restraint and Wheelchair Shown After Side Impact at 32 km/h chair and experienced severe arching of the back, see Figure 18. 3. The restraint design does not account for the inherent lateral weakness of the wheelchair in side impacts. In a side impact at 32.8 km/h, the wheelchair was destroyed and the dummy experienced significant lateral excursions, see Figure 19. ACCELERATION AMPLIFICATION FACTOR - It is difficult to substantiate the severity of the injuries that a wheelchair occupant might experience in impacts of the type that we have examined. Head impacts which give HIC (Head Injury Criterion) levels over 1000 are considered severe as are belt loads around 6.6 kN(l500 lbf)and chest decelerations above 60 g's for several milliseconds [9]. Many of the body excursions that we witnessed in these impact tests would be injurious to those with full body strength and flexibility; for wheelchair occupants, these body excur- sions would be even more damaging. To prevent extensive body excursion it is important that the body torso be restrained. This was accomplished in some of the tests by adding type 2 belts. When only type 1 belts were used, we generally witnessed the phenomenon previously called "acceleration amplification". We can demonstrate this by defining an acceleration amplification factor (AF) by the equation _ peak body acceleration nominal sled acceleration The peak body acceleration in (3) is the max- imum vector resultant of either the head acceleration or the thorax acceleration, whichever is greater. Table 5 lists the approximate AF numbers for the tests in Tables 2-4. In addition, the maximum belt loads and nominal sled de- celeration levels for each test are listed. The AF values in Table 5 range from AF = 2.6 to AF = 31. Those starred (*) are the result of short duration head impacts lasting for a few milliseconds while the other peak accelerations often last 10 ras or so. By com- paring Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5, it be- comes obvious that restraining the upper torso reduces signifi- cantly the AF values; the lowest values of AF are realized when type 2 belts are used. Of course, this is an expected result, It is also interesting to note the number of peak belt loads which approach or exceed 4.45 kN (1000 lbf) The ramifications are significant for C4/C5 quadraplegics who have reduced tolerance to distributed body loads.</page><page sequence="19">3624 E.

GENERAL DISCUSSION As currently mandated by federal stand- ards, active restraint systems with type 2 belts do not require dynamic performance test- ing i.e., crash testing. With the recent rescission (October, 1981) of the federal mandates on passive protection systems for cars manufactured after September 1, 1983, those portions of the FMVSS 208 standards [10] which establish dynamic crash protection requirements for passive systems are more or less mute. Now in those cases where manufac- turers of original or retrofit equipment still provide passive systems, we assume that the appropriate requirements of FMVSS 208 will still apply. We note that the crash performance tests as outlined in FMVSS 208 do not specify rear impact tests. This decision is probably based on the low percentage of fatalities (less than 10 %) that are attributed to rear collisions, see [11], and the protective attributes of seats currently in automobiles or vans. Wheelchairs, when used for passenger or driver seating obviously do not have these same protective features. Fortunately, current seat designs exceed the minimum requirements specified in FMVSS 207, some of which may be deficient. For example, the design requirement that an automobile seat be capable of withstanding a 3300 inch-pound (373 N#m)moment applied by a force to the seat's top structural member is deficient if one considers the inertial loads imposed by the torso of a body during a dynamic crash environ- ment . Assuming that a rear impact imparts 8-10 g accelerations to the automobile occupant, a 50th percentile subject would in turn impart an inertial load of 4.05 kN at the torso plus</page><page sequence="20">WHEELCHAIR RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 3625 head center of gravity, approximately 30 cm above the buttocks. This would cause a bending moment on the seat of about 1200 N-m, over three times the FMVSS 207 requirement. Typical wheelchair designs cannot withstand loads of this level. The point here is that the current federal standards do not always reflect the severity of dynamic loads that can be generated in crash environments. The consequences of applying these same federal standards to wheel- chair restraint designs are serious. Unfortu- nately, some wheelchair restraints currently on the market ref lect just this philosophy and have been designed for the static loads of FMVSS 207. In other cases where manufacturers crash test their restraint designs, the test phil- osophy often fails to reflect an "occupant protection" concern. Full instrumentation to determine the dynamic belt loads, HIC levels, torso deceleration levels and femur levels on a dummy are often absent and the investigation centers around whether the restraint contained the wheelchair and occupant, not whether the occupant was protected. If the tests show the wheelchair and occupant excursions restrained to reasonable limits and the restraint undamaged, the restraint is then often adver- tised as "crash worthy". Our investigations have demonstrated that several generic types of wheelchair restraints are not crash worthy, if we consider occupant protection to be the design objective. Many other conclusions have been drawn from our investigations to-date: 1. The wheelchair strength is woefully de- ficient in the lateral and rear direc- tions . 2. The wheelchair wheels should not be used as structural attachment points. 3. The upper torso of the wheelchair occu- pant must be restrained, either actively or passively, to minimize acceleration amplification. 4. Acceleration amplification factors can be high (up to 10) even without upper body impact with the vehicle interior, see the AF values in Table 5. 5. Belti loads in crash environments may be injurious to wheelchair occupants. 6. Restraint compliance may not always be beneficial. For example, the tests conducted on the T-bar restraint led to significant belt loads and to accel- eration amplification up to AF = 9. Of course, we draw the general conclusion that dynamic testing with full instrumentation is absolutely necessary for evaluating wheel- chair restraint designs. WHEELCHAIR RESTRAINT STANDARDS Ultimately this research program is to provide the information needed to develop a set of s tan dards /gui de lines which the Veterans Administration can use to evaluate and qualify wheelchair restraints /occupant protection systems for disabled veterans. A rough draft of this standard was presented to an advisory board composed of physicians, wheelchair restraint manufacturers, consumers, etc. during July, 1981 to solicit their input relative to the proposed contents; the response was favorable. The basic contents of the standard can be summarized as follows: 1. The classification adopted is wheelchair occupant protection system" (WOPS) , there- by denoting that the primary purpose of the wheelchair restraint device must be to protect the wheelchair occupant during normal and abnormal (crash) transportation situations . 2. Provisions for normal operation of the WOPS are made to ensure that it can be operated within the capabilities of the C4/C5 quadraplegic who, for example, is generally limited to arm forces of 5 pounds, often in one direction. These provisions relate to both the handicapped driver and the handicapped passenger of a vehicle. 3. Provisions to ensure quality and consis- tency of product. 4. Compliance tests to ensure that the WOPS satisfy the following categories of pro- tection: restraint compatibility (static and dynamic) ; structural integrity; occupant protection. Within the category of compliance tests, provisions are made to test and evaluate the occupant protection system in forward, lateral, and rear im- pacts. It is currently recommended that the forward impact test be conducted at 40 km/h (25 mph) and the lateral and rear tests be conducted at 32 km/h (20 mph) . PROOF-OF-STANDARD DESIGN - The deficiencies in the wheelchair restraints currently being marketed which do not qualify, in our opinion, as WOPS has motivated the design* of a new wheelchair restraint to meet the criteria being proposed in the WOPS standard; it is intended to be the proof-of-standard. As shown in Fig- ure 20, the somewhat crude prototype is a tri- pod chest protection design intended to distrib- ute any impact load over the person's chest. The wheelchair is attached at two points on the front members of the wheelchair. This, in effect, separates the body's inertial load, during impact, from that of the wheelchair's. Because of this load spearation, little mod- ification to the wheelchair will be necessary, only the addition of a fabric belt to the wheelchair back, a stiffening of the wheelchair back tubular members and possibly, a headrest. These modifications will not affect the normal operational features of the typical wheelchair. *The preliminary design of this WOPS is the result of a senior mechanical engineering project at Texas A&amp;M University [12].</page><page sequence="21">3626 E. SED, ET AL. Figure 20. A WOPS Prototype</page><page sequence="22">WHEELCHAIR RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 3627 We note that the features of this design are intended to minimize the mechanical obstacles confronting the wheelchair occupant. One ob- jective is to eliminate the necessity of latch- ing active belt systems. In the first two front- al tests, at impact speeds greater than 40 km/h, the dummy was successfully confined to the wheelchair without active belts of any kind. These tests demonstrated the feasibility of the concept but much testing and modification remain before this design approach will qualify as an occupant protection system. SUMMARY Reviewing the results presented in the paper, we recognize that the wheelchair restraint devices tested do not qualify themselves as WOPS. Sadly enough, it appears that occupant protection has not been the primary objective of most designs, rather wheelchair restraint. Often retaining belts are not included as part of the restraint system; in many cases belts are not even recommended. Without retaining belts, even moderate crash situations would be disastrous to the wheelchair occupant who has little or no strength to control body motion. In some instances, with the addition of type 2 (torso) belts, the tested wheelchair restraints can provide frontal impact protection but the complexity of the resulting system may conflict with the ability of the wheelchair occupant to use the wheelchair restraint system. In rear and side impacts, the designs tested are deficient and do not account for the dir- ectional structural deficiencies in the wheel- chair itself. Even with torso belts the dummy experienced g levels increased above the nominal sled deceleration levels by AF factors of up to 4.6. Where only a type 1 (pelvic) belt was used, AF factors of up to 10 occurred in the absence of head impact and, where head impact occurred, AF factors up to 30 were realized. Belt loads approaching 8 kN (1800 lbf) were experienced by both the torso and pelvic belts and in most tests belt loads around 3.5 kN (fy 800 lbf) were the norm. Considering that these loads often lasted 40 and 50 ms, the implications seem serious. A prototype of a wheelchair occupant pro- tection system has been tested and has perform- ed favorably although much modification and fur- ther testing remains. In effect, this design decouples the inert ial loading of the dummy from that of the wheelchair itself, reacting against the torso by a cushioned breastplate and restraining the wheel chiar by attachments to the wheelchair structural members. Objectives of this design are simplicity and the elimina- tion of any need for seatbelts. The rough draft of a set of standards has been prepared and tentatively approved with slight modifications by a research advisory group. This standard adopts the classification, wheelchair occupant protection system (WOPS) , provides guidelines to insure operational minimum standards, quality and consistency of product, and establishes compliance tests to insure that wheelchair restraint systems qualify as WOPS.
