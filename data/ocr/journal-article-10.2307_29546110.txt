<plain_text><page sequence="1">Fusions: Masquerades and Thought Style East of the Niger-Benue Confluence, West Africa by Richard Fardon London: Eastern Art Publish? ing, 2007. Saffron Afriscopes Series, Issue 2, Chamba Arts in Context, Volume 2. 207 pp., 11 color photos, 30 b/w photos. ?45.00 cloth reviewed by Gitti Salami Richard Fardons sophisticated study traces how various ethnic groups in the Middle Belt of Nigeria, primarily Chamba and their neigh? bors (Koma and Dowayo, who live to their east in Cameroon, and Mumuye, Jukun, Jukunoid, and Kulere people, who live to their west), materialize a religious thought style which either conflates, or brings into close associa? tion, things and beings that are dead or wild. The monograph is based on extensive field research among Chamba Daka (1970s) and Chamba Leko speakers (1980s), a comprehen? sive review of English and German scholar? ship on the broader region, and scrutiny of sixty Chamba theranthropic fusion masks in public and private collections in Europe and the United States. Originally inspired by the author's contact with art historian Arnold Rubin, Fardon, who thinks of himself primar? ily as an ethnographer with an interest in local epistemologies, here develops a methodological approach rooted in comparative anthropology and art historical connoisseurship. His objective is to gain an understanding of how, not what, Chamba Nam Gbalang (Chamba Daka) and Lang Gbadna masks (Chamba Leko) mean. The author thus sets out to bridge the ten? sion between two irreconcilable types of knowledge. While intensive ethnographic field research, such as constituted the basis of Fardons earlier work on Chamba reli? gious thought (1991), favors particular? ism and strives to encapsulate local ways of knowing, it tends to remain largely oblivi? ous to the connotations that particular prac? tices' participation in larger regional cultural complexes have. Chamba people, for exam? ple, whose immediate neighbors are either also Chamba, foreigners who have become Chambaized via their acquisition of Chamba masks, or are Chamba or ethnically distinct people without masking traditions, are prone to think of their masquerades as unique, even though they partake in a class of horizon? tal theriomorphic masks found across a vast region of the western and west-central Sudan (McNaughton 1991,1992). On the other hand, comparative investigation of shared cultural</page><page sequence="2"></page><page sequence="3">features across a region as broad as that out? lined by Patrick McNaughton, according to Fardons reckoning, becomes meaning? less, since it is incommensurable in terms of groups' specific historical interaction. It is further flawed because it revolves around outsider-imposed, trans-ethnic criteria that violate local knowledge. Chamba lexica, for example, would indicate that Chamba do not conceptualize "masquerades" in gen? eral terms apart from their specific locally charged contexts, and their masks' horizon tality, the dominant criterion of McNaugh ton's study, is shown to be more or less irrelevant in a Chamba context. Fardon instead pursues a third methodolog? ical approach. He investigates various cultures' overlapping thought styles, i.e., he examines networks of associations of which local varia? tions and understandings of masquerades, initiation practices, and funerary rites, rather than constituting the defining characteristics of a broad culture region, merely appear as the means different people employ to visually articulate similar cosmological convictions. A characteristic of this approach is the need to think of the criteria used to delineate a study at the outset (e.g., a particular formal attri? bute of a mask) as subject to revision, for the real object of such an inquiry, the underlying thought style, emerges only gradually and is likely informed by features of expressive cul? ture that escape the initial criteria (e.g., where a people, who participate in the cultural com? plex under investigation, lack a masking tra? dition). A study based on this method?the author unfortunately does not propose a name for it?rather than being finite, is so dynamic and responsive to the reality on the ground as to be "uncompletable in principle" (p. 29). Interestingly, although Fardon does not make the similarity between his method and semiotic theory explicit, he does draw on terms derived from that discipline when he briefly describes the ethnographic context of Chamba masks. Thus, Chamba masquerades are "potentially overfull, rather than empty, signifier[s]" (p. 44) that permit local observ? ers to variously draw on a web of associations between "the living, the dead, and the wild" (p. 36). These three composite elementary forces inform Chamba notions around being-in the-world and not only infuse humans with vitality, but, in different combinations and variously emphasized, also motivate masks and associated religious cults. The interpretive potential of this already unstable field of signi? fication is further increased by inscription of the living/dead/wild configurations with char? acteristics such as size, heat, color, and gender. For example, while masquerades' individual names and color disclose gender specificity, the overall appearance and bulky costume of Chamba masquerades are associated with the fleshiness of women's physiology and with life force; their performances evoke barely tamed animals; and the bony skull portions of the carved headpieces conjure up associa? tions with patrikin's responsibility for matters related to the collective dead. Fundamental to Chamba masks, which override association with specific cults (jup among Daka speakers, voom among Leko speakers), then, is that their tripartite structure, which consists of bovine horns, a human skull, and an aquatic animals snout, do not represent anything as specific as bush cows or buffalos, as McNaughton sug? gests, but rather are beings in their own right that lend themselves to fluid interpretations. Once basic concepts around Chamba mask? ing practices have been outlined, Fardon turns his attention to regional variations. A comprehensive review of the ethnographic literature on Chamba culture is carefully cor? related to collection data pertaining to extant Chamba masks in private and public col? lections, most of which Fardon was able to examine firsthand. Consideration of such materials as Leo Frobenius' 1911/12 Chamba expedition-generated notebooks, watercol ors, photographs, and published works; other, more incidental photographs taken by Ger? man colonial officers; Arnold Rubins 1965 photographs of Jukun-influenced masks used in Chamba emigrant chiefdoms of Suntai and Donga, and the discovery of the absence of Chamba theranthropic masks in Bali (emi? grant Chamba communities in vicinity of the Cameroon Grasslands) allow the author to discern a clear regional trajectory. The distri? bution of variant styles is subsequently placed into trans-ethnic cultural patterns of a much broader region. From west to east, Chamba masks gradually decrease in size; angular fea? tures such as noses, ears, and cranial ridges diminish in importance; and the stress placed on horizontal alignment of animal snout and horns in the extreme western region gives way to emphasis placed on the central, anthropo? morphized/human skull-associated portion of masks among Chamba people in the east. From north to south, masks are additionally subject to greater and clearer color/gender dif? ferentiation. In and of themselves these observations are not all that useful. However, Fardon's fur? ther concern with how the regional trends regarding Chamba masks manifest themselves among ethnically different people in a broader region yields significant insight into a Chamba thought style, which the author s earlier, strictly ethnographic investigations in Mapeo and Yeli did not easily reveal. Read as a narrative from east to west, the highly condensed and difficult-to-discern themes of Chamba theran? thropic fusion masks are refracted or, in Far dons words, shown to involve "kaleidoscopic reconfigurations of form, gender, animality, and humanity which theranthropic fusion as a materialized thought style evinces regionally" (p. 101). Conceptual components that Chamba concentrate within one mask, Mumuye, Jukun, and Jukonoid neighbors to the west of Chamba articulate either through juxtaposing numer? ous, much more clearly differentiated, gendered theriomorphic and anthropomorphic masks, or in the case of Kulere in the Southern Jos Pla? teau, through placing theriomorphic masks in association with actual human skulls that deco? rate the facade of skull houses. People to Cham bas east materialize a similar dead/wild thought style in performances that do not involve mas? querades at all. Thus Koma people across the border in Cameroon, as one example, articu? late it during top nagi rituals; these are designed to establish a mans paternal rights over his children and to honor his wife's farm work. Here, a slaughtered bull's horns are brought to a cult house and ultimately serve as an abode for ancestral spirits. Among Dowayo, also in Cameroon, materialized theranthropic fusion occurs during circumcision rituals and dur? ing interment. During the latter, a pear-shaped funerary bundle wrapped in textiles, which contains a corpse that is entirely encased in a slaughtered bull, resembles the overall appear? ance of a Chamba masquerade. This becomes particularly obvious during ceremonies, when such bundles are placed next to carved dome poles, massive forked poles that are designed to neutralize pollution resulting from the taking of enemy skulls. Domes branches, when read as part of the funerary bundles' overall form, look like the bovine horns on Chamba theranthropic fusion masks. As Fardon carefully interprets the meaning of minute formal variations of masks in this broad region on the basis of varying local understandings of masks' attributes, infor? mants' accounts, origin stories, and etymology of terms for masks and practices, he makes an altogether convincing argument. Aside from Chamba Nam Gbalang and Lang Gbadna masks, the text provides detailed descriptions of Mumuye horizontal therio? morphic Va-bon masks, a monkey mask, and vertical anthropomorphic masks; male and female versions of Jukun Aku-maga and Aku ma masks; Goemai Mongop masks, Mon tol Gugwom masks, and Jukunoid Ikikpo or Iki masks. To establish where the religious thought style under discussion breaks down, Fardon further briefly considers Mambila and Cameroon Grasslands masks. Of particular interest are two insights which Fardon derived from scrutiny of German colo? nial documentation that scholarship written in English hitherto ignored. Male Aku-maga masks (Aku-wunu) are ingenious; they can be worn vertically as face masks, in which case they take an anthropomorphic form, but when placed on maskers' heads horizontally, they are theriomorphic. Similarly, Fardons deconstruc 90 I alricanarts winter 2010</page><page sequence="4">tion of a watercolor by Carl Arriens (Plate 3g) from Leo Frobenius' 1913 Und Africa Sprach, is quite brilliant. Based on his scrutiny of Fro? benius notebooks, Fardon is able to establish that such illustrations in early colonial texts tried to capture the mood of performance practices for the reader, rather than to func? tion as documentary evidence. Fardon writes for a knowledgeable audi? ence. In fact, throughout the text he treats the reader as if he were in the middle of a conver? sation with someone who shared the author s intimate familiarity with the documentation or, at the very least, had read Fardons earlier work on Chamba culture. The text reads a bit like a very long footnote; the overall argument, although clearly expressed, is at times over? whelmed by the detailed account of Fardons sources. That said, the scholarship is exem? plary, and the reader is given ample visual aides to follow the author's complex reasoning. The book is lavishly illustrated. Fardon pro? vides color plates of museum objects, ample field photographs from his own research, reproductions of images from earlier pub? lished works (some of them of stunning qual? ity), a number of useful diagrams, maps, an index, a bibliography, and lastly, appendices of Jukun and Chamba masks in collections. As the volume is signature-sewn, it can withstand the rigorous flipping back and forth between pages that is the hallmark of an intriguing art historical text.
