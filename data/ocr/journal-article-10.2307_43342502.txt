<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DEVIL'S PRIVETEE At the end of his Tale , the Friar assures his fellow pilgrims that if he had world enough and time he could speak for a thousand winters on the multitudinous pains of hell. He does not, however, have leisure, and he does not give them the benefit of his vast knowledge of the infernal regions: Chaucer reserves this disquisition for the Summoner's friar, who dis- patches the matter in much less space than the pilgrim Friar had felt necessary for the subject. Yet, despite the Friar's si- lence, one of the "peynes" which he might well have had in mind is, I think, quite evident from what he had said earlier.</page><page sequence="2">The Devil's 'Privetee' 105 And it is, in fact, necessary to recognize this particular infernal punishment before one can fully appreciate the sly joke that the smiling feend of the Tale enjoys at the expense of the summoner. On discovering the identity of his fellow "bailly," the rash and unfearing summoner displays an inordinate curiosity about things devilish. He inquires at length about the mysteries of Satan's kingdom; he wants to know everything possible con- cerning (though he does not use the word) the devil's privetee. The fiend answers certain queries to the summoner's evident satisfaction, but finally, remarking that he will soon know enough of the mysteries of hell to qualify for a university chair, the fiend suggests that they go about their business. Immedi- ately before "henting" the summoner to hell, however, the fiend returns to the subject, using for the first time the term privetee in declaring that, Thou shalt with me to helle yet to-nyght, Where thou shalt knowen of oure privetee Moore than a maister of dyvynytee.1 Now, the fiend's turn of phrase here is distinctly reminiscent of the Miller's earlier usage, "Of Goddes pryvetee, nor of his wyf," where, as a result of the ambiquity of pryvetee and con- tamination from the context, the "mysteries" of God leeringly invite the lewd, anthropomorphic "God's private parts." The same is clearly true of the devil's privetee , even more graphically so in light of medieval art and vision literature, wherein certain of the punishments of hell are closely connected with the private parts of Satan. One of the most striking of scenes is that of Satan devouring and excreting sinners. Such grotesque imagery is, of course, not uncommon in medieval illumination, though perhaps receiving its best representation at the hands of Hie- ronymus Bosch in the Hell section of the Garden of Delights 1 Quotations from Chaucer are from The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer, ed.

Baird triptych.1 The visions of Mechthild de Magdeburg (c. 1212- 1277), however, furnish the best evidence in connection with the summoner, for she links the private parts of Satan with the summoner's besetting sin, greed: He [Satan] gulps down the greedy man because he always wants more. But then when he has swallowed him, he comes out of him again behind. . . and at many an hour will he stuff himself and his maw gapes wide.2 Whatever may be the case with the Friar (perhaps merely repeating in his Tale an exemplum he had once heard and himself blithely unaware of his own fiend's sly innuendo),3 the Summoner clearly recognized the ambiguities of the term in its suggestive context. For this "saucefleem," bitter pilgrim deliberately picked up and luridly painted the picture of the nest of friars swarming in and out of the devil's privetee.
