<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOL. L. No. I97.] [JANUARY, 194I. MI ND A QUARTERLY REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGY AND PHILOSOPHY I.-OTHER MINDS (II.). BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT." BY JOHN WISDOM. Black. We can never really be certain what is going on in the mind of another. Even if a man, when given a gold watch, showed every sign of being delighted and never, before or after- wards, not even to his most intimate friends, gave us any ground to suppose he was anything but what he then appeared to be, it would still remain possible that he was not delighted. And by the same reasoning, even were parrots or monkeys to talk like people at a party it would remain possible that they neither thought nor felt, and there is nothing illogical in supposing that a friend's body should continue to nod, smile and talk just as before he went to sleep, although now his mind and soul are no longer in his body-the body keeps up the old habits-there is nothing logically absurd about this idea any more than there is .,anything logically absurd about the idea that though his body is still in death his mind is active, thinking and feeling in some other world. White. You might as well say we can't be certain there aren't leprechauns in watches. You might as well say we can't be certain that any current runs in electric wires. You might as well say we can't be certain that there's any energy in live batteries, as say we can't be certain that there's any consciousness in live bodies. 1</page><page sequence="2">2 JOHN WISDOM: Black. But this last is different. It is, of course, absurd to ask when a watch shows- no pecularities whether it isn't perhaps leprechaun guided. And it is also absurd to ask whether a battery contains a charge when it possesses just those peculiarities which people describe by saying that it's charged. It is even absurd to ask whether a man is dead when his body continues to show no sign of life, and no one expects it to. Or rather, it is absurd to ask this if what you mean by " dead " is " no longer in the body, no longer driving it". But it doesn't follow that the man doesn't exist anywhere, disembodied or in a new body. It is " I shall be dead to-morrow " in this disembodied sense which provides " a first-class puzzle for the positivists ".1 For how could it be verified? I know indeed what it would be like to watch my own funeral-the men in tall silk hats, the flowers and the face beneath the glass-topped coffin. But "To-morrow I shall be no more " doesn't mean to me merely this account of what you'll see if you're at the cemetery in time. To prove that "There's a current in this wire " means no more than " This wire is connected to a battery at one end and rings bells at the other " is not to prove that " There's a soul in this body " means no more than " This body converses intelligently ", much less is it to prove that " The soul of this body exists somewhere " means no more than " You can wake lhim if you shake him ". White. We haven't proved anything at all. We haven't proved that it is absurd for the philosophical scientist to ask " Is there a leprechaun in this watch ? ", " Is there a current in this wire ? " We have only reminded ourselves of the things everyone knows about the way these sentences work and described these things so as to make these " questions" "answerable ". There is a difference between these questions and "Is there a soul in this body?" But, as so often happens, you are under-concerned about the cases which don't trouble you at the moment, and over-concerned about the one that is striking you at the moment. We have seen in what ways " The watch shows all signs of being animated by an invisible leprechaun, but is it really ? " does do something like registering a doubt; and we have seen how " Is there a brownie or a leprechaun within ? " does come near to opposing two hypotheses which are therefore not both identical with " This watch sings fairy songs and disappears on Midsuimmer night, etc." 'The philosophical scientist who asks " Are there leprechauns within the leprechaun-watches ? ", "Are there entelechies in living things ? ", "Are there currents in electric wires ? ", is not 1 Dr. A. C. Ewing, MIND, JUlY, 1937, p. 353.</page><page sequence="3">OTHER MINDS. 3 being merely absurd. True, it is queer to ask, " Is there an invisible current in this wire ? " when both (1) the wire shows all features which have been present wherever we have before applied the expression " an invisible current runs through this wire ", and (2) we can't explain what would more encourage us to believe that an invisible current is present. Certainly that is queer. At the same time, one can understand the scientist's feeling it difficult to say that the electrical symptoms the wire exhibits entail that an invisible current runs through it. It isn't a recognised principle of logic that if a thing gives off sparks, rings bells and drives trams then an invisible current runs through it. If you like, it is a logical principle that a wire giving such symptoms is " electrically charged ". That expres- sion you may well say just sums up the symptoms. But to say that a current runs through it-that is going further, and the philosophical scientist excusably expresses hesitation about saying that the symptoms entail the presence of a current. If he says he doubts whether even in- cases where all the symptoms are present a current really runs, he is deciding against saying that the symptoms entail the current. No one has ever seen one and then, to take a different sort of consideration, if it is a current that flows it is a very knowing sort of current. For, unlike water or any sort of current, it knows before it enters a channel whether the channel is clear. It is as if when a wire is connected with a battery the wire becomes alive and willing to serve us in certain ways and apt to harm us in others. But there is another point. I am astonished at your lack of sympathy with those who say that perhaps Smith is in his dead body though he will never move again.' To say this is, after all, no more absurd than to say that he is still somewhere. True, he is showing no sign of being in his body. But then he is showing no sign of being anywhere, anywhere in the world. If you think it possible-that he's still somewhere, isn't it possible that he's still in his body, and that if you mummify it he will play possum there for ever. If Socrates is still alive, he is quite invisible. And when you die if you are still alive you will be quite invisible. And surely one of the places you may be in is your body. So after all is it absurd to say " His body shows no signs of life and I know it isn't going to, but whether his soul is still in his body I don't know " ? Surely it is no more absurd than saying that his body shows no sign of life but perhaps he exists somewhere. Or, if 1 Rupert Brooke, Doubts. " For if the soul be not in place, what has laid trouble in her face ? "</page><page sequence="4">4 JOHN WISDOM: you like, surely it is only more absurd. I mean that there is no difference in principle. It is only a degree more absurd for me to say " There are unicorns in Piccadilly " than it is for me to say (" There are unicorns somewhere ". In both cases I can make excuses when we can't find the unicorns. I can say that there are unicorns in Piccadilly but that they are made of ectoplasm which can be seen only in infra-red rays and that ordinary matter such as buses and taxis goes right through it. It is only easier to make excuses for "There are unicorns, somewhere ". I just say "Piccadilly is not the place for them ". You say, "What about the Brighton Road ? " I say, " No, not the Brighton Road, but perhaps at the Pavilion ". If we also fail to find any at the Pavilion, and even in Ethiopia, then people will begin to lose interest in my statement that unicorns are still extant; and if people who haven't heard me say this before are astonished and interested, then those who have will warn them, saying, " White's unicorns are very hard to find ", or "Yes, White's unicorns exist somewhere-in heaven you understand ", or "White's unicorns exist-at the point of infinity ". Black. Ah ! if all that is meant by "in his body " is mere presence withoout any action, then it is a serious question whether Smith is in his body. It's only when we use " in his body " as most people use " still in the body ", meaning " still shows all the usual signs of life ", that it is absurd to ask, " Is Smith in his body ? His heart has ceased to beat, there is no sign of life and will be none, but is he still in the body ? " In a use in which Smith's being in his body means that he is driving it such a question is absurd. But of course when no such activity is implied, then " Does Smith exist, and is he still seeing out of his body or dreaming ? " is a serious question, like " Are people unconscious under chloroform or are they perhaps terribly conscious though they always quite forget it afterwards ? " It all depends on what you mean by 1 " Is Smith in his body ? " 1 This last remark is a heart-breaking one. It is a complication especi- ally prevalent in modern times. Again and again we have (1) philosophers who say " si. .. s,S entail or are identical with ? ", and (2) philosophers who deny this. Sometimes we have (3) those who say " There is a sense of 'Z ' in which s8 . . . Sn entail ? and a sense in which they don't ". They are nearer a proper view of the dispute than those in (1) and (2). But just because of this it is harder to show what is wrong with their idea of it. Every question, Does P entail Q? (Is a tomato a fruit or a vegetable ?), is a matter of what is meant by ' P' and ' Q ' and that not merely in the way in which an empirical question Is every P a Q ? is a matter of what is meant. For Does P entail Q depends only on what is meant. But it doesn't depend on what is meant, it is a question of what is meant. Con-</page><page sequence="5">OTHER MINDS. 5 White. But mightn't one just as well say that if all one means by 'leprechaun haunted' is 'sings fairy songs, etc.', then it is absurd to ask " This watch sings fairy songs, etc., but is it leprechaun haunted ' but if one means more, then it is not absurd. Black. No, that is different. Wlhat we have seen in the leprechaun case is that " There is an invisible leprechaun within this watch " has a meaning different from " This watch sings fairy songs, etc.", but that this difference is such as to make the question " This watch sings fairy songs, etc., but is it leprechaun haunted or brownie haunted or not haunted at all but just wonderful? "not a question as to which of several hypotheses is correct but a request as to which of several mnemonic pictures to employ. In this way, as you put it, the question " Is there a leprechaun within?" is not answered nor found to have two answers. It vanishes. The anxious doubt becomes a cheerful indecision as we see the inappropriateness of the interrogative form. But with an ambiglous question the interrogative form is not inappropriate. Thus, in the case of " Is Smith's soul in his body ? ", the interrogative form is appropriate, it is only that there should be two instead of one if conversation is to go forward without confusion. In the ordinary somewhat loose use of language we say when we know that a man will never move again that his soul has left his body. And in this sense it is absurd to ask " Has his soul left his body ? " when you know he will never move again. But in this case, as opposed to the invisible leprechaun case, there is left another sense of " Is his soul perhaps still in his body ? " which is a serious question. It is the question whether his sensations and feelings are going on just the same though now he can show no signs of them owing to a complete paralysis. The scientist who talks about a current running sequently, to answer It depends on what you mean by ' P ' or It depends on what you mean by 'Q' does nothing towards answering the question Does P entail Q ? lt only reformulates it as Does ' P's' meaning include the meaning of ' Q'? or, if you like, Does 'P' stand for something which entails Q? And if the answer given is 'P' stands for one thing which en- tails Q and for another which doesn't, then one must ask, Have you any rewson for saying this except that some of us here and now wish to say that P entails Q while some of us do not P In cases of philosophkcal difficulty, e.g. Does no sign of life entail Smith is not in his body?, the answer must be That is My only reason. But then the answer to the question Some of u8 are inclined to say that P entails Q, some that it doesn't.- Which is right? becomes If ' P.' and IQ' were used as some of u8 are now inclined to use them then the answer would be P does entail Q, and if they were used as some others of Us are inclined to use them, then the answer would be P does not entail Q.</page><page sequence="6">6 JOHN WISDOM: through an electric wire isn't serious about the current. He is, of course, serious, sober, as contrasted with one who is telling a fancy " In the clock on the stairs lives a hobgoblin ", or one who says " There's a demon in my watch ". But his sobriety arises solely from those purposes which his sentence serves, which could be as well served by a sentence which doesn't mention a current but employs some other convenient metaphor for reminding and warning us of the peculiar properties of this wire. And it is the same with " The sea is angry " and " Neptune is stirring up the sea ". People who say these things aren't serious. They know they are only " making-a-story-of-the-facts ", like your governess who, when the gate conveniently blew open before you, said " A kind fairy opens the gate for you ". But one who, when Smith frowns, says " Smith is angry ", is serious, and is not merely " making-a-story-of-the-facts " about Smith's behaviour. He is making a claim which goes beyond the behaviour, and may thus be in serious doubt when the behaviour is not in doubt. And "Is it that Smith sees the Union Jack in red, white and blue or does he see it black, green and yellow? " are two serious alternatives. White. Again, you do not sympathize enough with the cases/ which aren't striking youz now. The primitive scientist who says "Puck is in the churn ", although he doesn't at all expect to see anything, is serious, like the Greeks who held there were spirits in the trees. Quite as serious as those who say " God drives the world ". Would you call them serious ? Would you call this question serious: " Is the world controlled by a God who often forgets or by a Devil who sometimes relents ? " Or would you say " No, this is only a matter of what picture you employ to vent your attitude to the world like you vent your attitude to your watch " ? And remember that very unprimitive, very sophisti- cated scientists say that, though of course they seriously believe that men think, they aren't serious when they say that dogs do, because they have discovered that dogs are really just compli- cated machines, so that when they say a dog has learned that a bell means meat they just mean that his saliva runs when the bell rings. These scientists don't expect anything different of dogs from what the rest of us expect. But they represent them- selves as having lost their childish faith in dogs. Others again, moving in the opposite direction, say that they are convinced that flowers feel. Black. Those who say that dogs don't think or feel, and those who say that flowers do are both serious. And even the modern theologian is serious. True, he is quite unlike the primitive</page><page sequence="7">OTHER MINDS. 7 believer in God, who believes that the floods have been sent by God, and thinks that if he prays before he sets about trying to save the sheep that will make a difference to the number of sheep he saves. The modern theologian knows that that is only an anthropomorphic superstition, and he no more expects sacrifice or prayer to make any difference to the number of sheep saved than does an atheist. White. Perhaps the modern theologian has different expecta- tions of the next world. Black. Not the most modern ones. They regard hope of personal immortality as another childish feature of primitive belief. But they seriously believe that something is going on now other than the processes of nature, namely, the supervising mental processes of a super-being. And this is what makes their question serious. This is what you either can't or won't under- stand. There is, of course, some difficulty about drawing the line between serious psychological statements suach as " Smith is angry " and unserious ones such as " The sea is angry ", " My motor-cycle is in a bad mood this morning ", or (shall we add ?) "I suppose the flowers feel better for the sun ". Nevertheless, just as "A current runs through this wire" provides a picture only because it is in other cases a serious assertion that. a cuitent is running through a thing, so do "The sea is angry ", "Neptune is angry ", provide pictures only because " The bull is angry ", "Smith is angry " are serious. White. Steady. There's a difference here. There's not the same difference between a serious psychological statement and a non-serious one as there is between a serious physical statement and a non-serious one. I feel inclined to say "Flowers feel pain when they are shrivelled -by frost " doesn't involve any picture apart from a picture of shrivelling flowers. Now " There is a leprechaun in the watch " does involve another picture besides the watch's singing songs, a picture of a leprechaun. Black. Well, but don't you get an organic image of the pain the flowers feel ? White. Yes, only somehow this is diflerent in a way we have already noticed.' Suppose that from where we lie we can see hats and heads above a low hedge, moving smoothly along. Then if I say " They are moving with the current " I speak seriously, because 1 NMND, October, 1940, p. 378, section 10.</page><page sequence="8">8 JOHN WISDOM: a picture 1 of liquid flowing is connected in the following way with what I aim to do by uttering my sentence: I aim to get you to expect to see a liquid corresponding to that picture. Suppose that we can see as we look at the blood in a vein little red bodies moving along but on no visible current. Then, if I say " They are moving on a current ", someone may say " It's an invisible one, then ", thus drawing attention to a peculiarity in the con- nexion between my words and pictures on the one hand and my claims on the other. When I say " Yes, but not quite invisible " and hand him a stronger microscope which shows the red bodies floating on a clear liquid, then I draw attention to a likeness between (a) the connexion between my words and pictures and my claims, and (b) the ordinary connexion between the sentence " They are on a current " and the claims made by one who utters it. Because of this likeness we mav say that I am still seriously speaking of a current. We come to the case when I am not speaking seriously of a current. This is when I have in mind no means, not even eccentric means like microscopes, for seeing or feeling the current. When I am not speaking seriously, then it becomes absurd to speak of more direct evidence for my claim that a current is present, because my claim has come to include only the indirect signs of the presence of a current; I mean no more, I assert no more, and so my assertion cannot be supported by finding other signs. And by the same fact it is unshaken by their absence. Now if this is what is meant by the distinction between serious and not serious statements then we must call all psychological statements not serious. For with all of them all the guiding pictures are not connected with the claims made in such a way as to allow us to speak of directly verifying the statement by finding the reality which fits the guiding picture. Let us run over the way in which a sentence, e.g. " There is a dagger in the air ", may pass from a physical to a psychical use. Suppose Smith says " There is a dagger in the air ", then in the ordinary way I look up and expect a sensation to fit the image of a dagger which his sentence perhaps gave me. But maybe very queer things have been happening of late. One week everybody 1 Of course I need not have had such an image or picture when I spoke. In that case we must describe the difference between my speaking seriously of a current and speaking " metaphor'ically ", " fictitiously ", of a current in some other way. One might say that when I speak seriously, I aim to produce expectation in you which will be in fact the same as those who expect to see a liquid corresponding to the picture, in other words, expect to see a current.</page><page sequence="9">OTHER MINDS. 9 passing a certain place would get a wound showing the teeth marks of an animal. Another week everybody passing a certain place would get a wound such as a burning torch would make. Another week everybody passing a certain place would get a wound such as a dagger would make. It has become the custom to say in a horrified voice that there's a wolf's head, a burning torch, or a dagger at the place, according to which group of phenomena appears. Suppose now Smith says in the usual horrified voice, " There's a dagger in the air ". I don't now expect a sensation of a dagger nor do I expect sensations of others saying they have a sensation of a dagger. Of course not. I know it to be an invisible dagger. But the word 'dagger' and the picture of a dagger guide me as to what to expect. I expect a different sort of wound when people say " There's a dagger in the air " from what I expect when they say " There's a torch in the air ". Suppose now that Smith is an inmate of a mental hospital. Morning after morning he has some frightful hallucination. This morning he shouts, " There's a dagger in the air ". I don't take this seriously in the sense that I expect to get a sensation of a dagger in the air nor a sensation of other people, dogs, cameras, or wire hoops saying " There is a dagger in the air ". The sentence still gives me a picture of a dagger and not a torch, and this picture still guides me, but now it guides me only with regard to Smith. That is, it guides me only with regard to the sensations I shall get from looking at and listening to Smith and what I shall see and hear if I watch and listen to people who are watching and listening to Smith. This is what makes it a, psychological, subjective statement. At least it makes it a psychological, subjective statement for me though not for Smith if Smith expects us all to see his dagger. As to whether his statement was objective because it was objective for him who made it or subjective because it was subjective for him who heard it, I leave it to you to decide. Let us say it was a false objective statement though it truly told us what Smith saw, or that it was false about the contents of the real physical world but true about the contents of Smith's mind. Suppose, lastly, that Smith knows very well that he is subject. to hallucinations when he wakes, and only says to us " There's a dagger in the air " because we are his doctors, and we like to know what form the hallucination takes each morning. Then, though the sound he makes is like that he made when he was making an objective statement with " There's a dagger in the air ", nevertheless what he is doing is like what is done by one who says " It looks to me</page><page sequence="10">10 JOHN WISDOM: just as if there's a dagger in the air, but that's nothing to go by, I've been so queer of late ". Here again the -sentence gives a guiding picture, but now no one expects to see anything to fit the picture, and no one, not even Smith, expects anyone to see anything to fit the guiding picture. Black. I see what you are getting at. It is what you have been getting at all along. You want to say " There's a dagger in the air " when used by Smith as a psychological statement, as a purely subjective statement, is only a way of telling us about what Smith will say he sees, about what he will draw if asked to draw what he sees, about what he will point to if asked to point to examples of the sort of thing he sees, in short, about what we may expect in the way of behaviour from Smith. You want to say that like " There's a dagger in the air ", used to predict a pattern of wound-sensations in oneself and others, and like " There's an invisible leprechaun inside ", used to predict a pattern of song and disappearance sensations, so is " Smith sees an hallucinatory dagger " used to predict a pattern of sensations from Smith, a diflerent sort of pattern, a psychological pattern, but for all that a pattern of what can be seen and heard. For it is used to predict what Smith will say he sees, what he will draw if asked to draw what he sees, what he will point to if asked to point to examples of what he sees. And you want to say that all psychological statements are unserious in that the guiding picture which goes with them, though it guides like the picture of the invisible leprechaun, guides only in that way. You want to say that the utterance of a psychological sentence doesn't ever lead one to expect any sensation corresponding to the one it primarily brings to mind. Thus, " Smith sees the Tricolour in red, white and blue " doesn't lead one to expect any sensation of red, white and blue whether one looks up to the sky or into Smith's brain, and " Smith feels sick " doesn't lead one to expect a sensation of sickness. Nevertheless, somehow, you must allow, there is a dif$erence between a serious and a non-serious psychological statement. Among physical and semi-physical statements there are (i) some which would usually be called "half-joking" or "not serious ", as when the father says, " The wolves are gaining ", or someone says, "There must be a demon in this house, the way I lose things "; there are (ii) others, which have just now been called unserious because of a certain likeness to the unserious ones, such statements as " There is a current in this wire ". These are semi-serious, because though part of what you might expect from " There's a current in this wire is not to be expected ", part</page><page sequence="11">OTHER MINDS. 11, of it is to be expected, namely, what we should call a pattern of reaction such as one would expect if one knew that really there was a current running through it (or a leprechaun within); and (iii) there are fully serious physical statements such as " A slate has fallen off the roof ". With psychological statements, too, there are what would ordinarily be called non-serious ones as, for example, "A goblin lives in the clJock on the stairs ", "My motor cycle is very fickle ". The latter isn't quite unserious, it tells you how irregular in response is the speaker's motor-cycle. And there are, of course, serious psychological statements such as "Evangeline is cross ". And then there are the semi- serious psychological statements corresponding to the semi-serious physical statements about invisible leprechauns and currents. I refer to statements about unconscious feelings. When an analyst tells you that Smith hates his mother and you protest that he doesn't, that you have asked him, then the analyst smiles like the scientist smiled when you looked with a magnifying glass for the current in the wire. The analyst smiles and says, "Not a conscious wish " (not a visible current). White. This just confirms what I say. I may now put my point in this way. Unlike goats and leprechauns, all feelings are invisible. The analyst's invisible feeling is called invisible, not because only indirect criteria are relevant to the truth of his statement, for that is-true of any statement about a feeling, in the sense that one cannot feel with one's own senses whether Smith has a feeling,' but because some of the indirect criteria usually counted are not to be counted. Just as our seeing nothing when we look for a current in a wire is prevented from counting against the statement "A current is now running through it ", by the saving phrase " an invisible current I mean of course ", so is Smith's denial that he hates his mother prevented from counting against the analyst's -statement that he does, by the saving phrase, " an unconscious wish, of course ". But in the latter case it is not that direct criteria for the state- ment have been dropped; they never have been used. Or, if you like, since it is not that there are direct criteria which might have been used and have not, let us say that the distinction between direct and indirect criteria doesn't apply here, in other words, that we have not provided a use for the phrases, ' psychological statement directly verified', 'psychological state- ment only indirectly verified'. 1 Or should one say, " We can imagine, of course, and in fact it has happened, that one person has felt with his own senses another's feeling " ?</page><page sequence="12">12 JOHN WISDOM: When we went over the uses of " There's a dagger in the air" we saw when this physical looking statement became psycho- logical. It was when no dagger sensations or lack of them wa's relevant to it but only a pattern of sensations from Smith who uttered it and people looking at Smith. Now if this is all the claim it makes, it is absurd when you get these sensations to say "Still I don't know whether it is true, still maybe it isn't true ". Black. But this is just the point. Is that all the claim it makes ? It makes, in addition to the claim that you and others will get a certain sensation on looking at Smith, the claim that Smith is having a certain sensation. White. Isn't the meaning of a statement a matter of its effect on hearers ? Now " Smith sees the Union Jack in red, white and blue " puts a picture of a Union Jack into the heads of hearers, but if it is purely psychological and subjective it does not lead them to expect Union Jack sensations but only (1) sensations of Smith saying in all languages (mouth, pen and paint brush) that he sees the Union Jack, and (2) sensations of people saying that Smith sees the Union Jack. This is its claiming that Smith is having a certain sensation, viz., a Union Jack sensation. " Smith sees the Union Jack in red, white and blue " puts a picture of a Union Jack into a hearer's head. And for Jones to ask when he has these sensations from Smith and from people looking at Smith, " Does Smith see the Union Jack ? ", is a joke. Jones is lilke one who, when it is well known how we use " leprechaun haunted ", nevertheless asks " Is there really a leprechaun in this watch? " even after he has heard it sing and found it disappear on Midsummer night. He relapses to a use in which there are not only outer but also inner signs of the presence of X, in this instance a leprechaun. It is like someone who, though he knows that by submicroscopic structure we mean a structure not visible by any microscope, nevertheless asks " Has this such and such a sub-microscopic structure ? True, it shows the outward signs of this, but has it ? " He asks a question which feels sensible because in other cases in which one speaks both of outward signs and inward explaining presence there is sense in saying " The out- ward signs are here but shall we find the usual inward presence ? " In other cases we have explained the different reactions of two like things by guessing at different things inside them and often these guesses have been correct but sometimes incorrect. But when the assertions, " There's a dagger in the air ", " This stuff has such and such a structure ", make no claim beyond those peculiarities of the air and the stuff which they are posited to explain, then having found these peculiarities, it would be absurd</page><page sequence="13">OTHER MINDS. 13 to ask, " Is there a dagger in the air? ", "Has this stuff an x structure ? " Black. You keep saying the same thing in different words. The point is, " Smith sees the Union Jack in red, white and blue, that's why he says he does, that's why he draws one when you ask him to draw what he sees ", is a different sort of explanation from " An electric current runs through it ", " There's a lepre- chaun within ", "It has such and such a sub-microscopic structure ". I am quite prepared to allow, of course, that any matter of the meaning of a sentence must appear in the eflects it has on its hearers or in the effects its speakers intended it to have-on its hearers. I am prepared to go further and say that even when the effects on hearers of two sentences are different in a way which makes it incorrect to say they mean the same, nevertheless the cifference is not such as to give sense to the question, " Which is correct ? ", unless the two sentences lead to different expectation of sensation. Thus " There is a leprechaun within ", " There is a brownie within ", have different meanings, but, in the usages we have described, there was no sense in " Shall I bring you a watch with a leprechaun inside or one with a brownie inside ? " But what I insist upon is that " Smith sees the Union Jack in red, white xand blue and talks like the rest of, us", and " Smith sees the Union Jack in black, red and yellow, and calls colours by different names from the rest of us ", do lead to different expecta- tions. In other words, I insist that your account of the effects on a hearer of a psychological sentence was not adequate. Not only does " Smith feels sick " raise in my mind a faint sensation of sickness which, though I expect no copy of it, nevertheless serves to guide me in what I expect of Smith. It does something else as well. It leads me to expectfor Smith a sensation of sickness, a sensation if you like corresponding to my faint sensation of sickness. And this is connected with another inadequacy of yours. You said, " There isn't a difference between serious and unserious psychological statements in the way there is between serious and unserious physical statements, because no one ever expects a sensation to fit the principal picture that goes with ' Smith feels sick ', ' Smith feels as if he sees the Union Jack ' ". But it isn't true that no one does. Smith does. If Smith over- hears " We must take out Smith's teeth or he'll be colour-blind by to-morrow ", this doesn't in Smith as it does in us merely produce a picture of frocks, faces, flags and landscapes all in grey, guiding us to expectations of his muddling his job as a signalman and being unable to tell the Belgian flag from the Tricolour. On</page><page sequence="14">14 JOHN WISDOM: the contrary Smith looks at the poppies in the corn and says "No more of this, only this " and he looks at a colourless engraving, and so doing he expects. Not only has he pictures of things in grey, but he expects with these just as we expect with our pictures of Smith crashing the trains. The sentence, " Smith will be colour-blind ", in so far as it is positive, leads in Smith at least to an expectation of a sensation which copies the engraving and, in so far as it is negative, prevents expectation of a sensation copying a coloured picture. It's serious for him. The descrip- tion of its influence on his expectation is not complete when we have told how he expects to muddle the trains and the flags, for it also effects his expectations in a way it effects no one else's. And with these facts that " Smith will be colour blind " is serious for him, and affects his expectations beyond behaviour goes the the fact that he can directly verify it, that the distinction between directly verifying and indirectly verifying the statement has an application for him. And as I said, you gave an inadequate account of the effect on us of the statement, " Smith will be colour-blind to-morrow ". Not only does this statement lead us to expect him to muddle the trains and the flags, it also leads us to expect for him sensations corresponding to the engraving, although the only sensations it leads us to expect for ourselves are sensations from his muddling the trains and flags and things. And when to-morrow Smith crashes the trains, confuses the flags, and fails with Holmgrens wools, and we still ask, " Is he colour- blind ? ", then we shall be wondering whether our expectation for him has been fulfilled.' And this after all is only to be expected, in view of the fact that "Smith will be colour-blind to-morrow " certainly means more to Smith than any story, however complete, about his confusing flags, crashing trains, etc. For if it is allowed that it thus means more to Smith than any story about behaviour, it must be allowed that it also means more to us, unless it is claimed that though Smith speaks English, "Smith will be colour-blind to-morrow" has for him a different meaning from what it has for us. White. You have brought out an incompleteness, a relevant incompleteness, in my account of how the working of a sentence passes from a physical to a purely psychical working. As you 1 It may here be added, " And when we wish we could know, we are wishing our powers of knowing of mental states were increased so that we could know directly the states of others as we know our own ", cf. our wishing that our powers of discriminating weight were increased so we could tell directly, as well as by the visual clue of scales, whether feathers differ in weight.</page><page sequence="15">OTHER MINDS. 15 say, " Smith will be colour-blind to-morrow " means more to Smith than that he will mishandle the jobs we entrust to him, it is serious for Smith in another way, it gives further expectations besides the expectations of mishandling jobs. Black. Yes. So even if we count as relevant to the meaning for a, person of a sentence only what expectations it gives and prevents in him we shall still have to say that there is a difference in meaning between, on the one hand, " You will crash the trains, confuse the flags, and so on to-morrow because you will see everything in greys ", and, on the other hand, " You will see reds and greens and blues the same as ever to-morrow, but you will crash the trains and confuse the flags and fail in tests and say you see everything grey just as if you were colour-blind ". For these two sentences have different effects on the expectations of the one to whom they are addressed. So does " You will be blind to-morrow " prevent expectation in the person to whom it is addressed in a way in which t" You will act just as if you were blind " does not. So does "To-morrow you will be no more "-the only pare negative-prevent expectation in the person to whom it is addressed in a way in which it does not in others, and in a way in which " To-morrow your body will lie still " does not. In general, the more a statement " S is or will be P " is psychological, and even such a physiological statement as " I shall be swimming to-morrow " is a bit psychological, the more does it raise or prevent expectations (for himself) in a hearer who is S, different from those it raises or prevents (for themselves) in hearers who are not S. White. That's so. When a man who has recently had his tonsils out says to you, just as you are being wheeled off to have yours out, " You'll be given chloroform, so you won't show any sign of feeling anything, but you will all the same, although many people forget all about it when they come round ". Then his saying that will have a different effect on you from what his saying " You will be under chloroform, you'll feel nothing " would have had. The fears the latter would have soothed the former raises. Your expectations as you reach the theatre are very different from what they might have been. Black. And so are the expectations of your friends. They expect you to lie quite still, but now they can't help fearing for you that you will be feeling it all the time. Not only your friends, but as you say, all those who speak English will under- stand what you understand by " You'll feel everything just the same, although you will lie so quiet under the ansesthetic ". And since this certainly means something to you and alters</page><page sequence="16">16 JOHN WISDOM: your expectations from what they were when you had been told that you would lie still and feel nothing, it also means something to them, alters their expectations. And this is so although their -expectations of what you'll do aren't altered. Likewise, " Smith will be colour-blind " plays on his hopes and fears, alters his expectations, in a way in which " Smith will confuse the flags, erash the trains, fail in all tests, and never turn on people and say, 'I was having you on ' " does not. Tr-e, " You'll be in tears in a minute " means as much as " You'll be unhappy in a minute ". But that's only because " You'll be in tears in a minute " isn't really merely a description of behaviour, but is Teally a semi-psychological statement. And if it were used merely as a description of behaviour so that the speaker added, "and there will be no tear gas about nor onions near, nor pepper in your eyes ", then, however much information of this sort were added, it would never have the same meaning as " You will be unhappy in 'a minute ". A person -who hadn't ever been unhappy even if he understood all about the onions and the gas couldn't understand " You'll be unhappy ". Some children know very well like doctors the symptoms of being in love and -use it of just the right people. But we say, " They don't really -understand, they don't fully understand. They've never been in love ". Of course, when they shall have been in love then they -will understand, and its just then that " I am sure Jack will fall in love with Joan " or " I am sure you will fall in love with Joan " comes to mean more to them than " He will call with -flowers ". It is just then that " Jack will fall in love " makes a difflerence to their expectations in a way in which " He will call with flowers " does not, unless, of course, it does, because it has become a hidden psychological statement. That is to say, when they understand " Jack will fall in love ", " Jack will be un- happy ", " Jack will see a dagger ", then they understand what -he understands by this, then it affects their expectations in the way in which it affects his. Now, as I have admitted, only when ' love' came to mean to Jack more than a motor in the moonlight did he understand what love is and only when it does this too for the other children, do they understand.' The point is, they don't understand " He'll fall in love " until it means to them what it means to the person it is about when he understands " You'll fall in love ". In othet words, when they do understand 1 This could be expressed by saying, " Only when a motor in the moon- light came to mean to him more than a motor in the moonlight did he come to understand love, and only when it came to mean more to them too did they too come to understand love ".</page><page sequence="17">OTHER MINDS. 17 then it means to them what it means to the person it is about. And as we have already seen that it means more to him than any story about behaviour, and does this because it leads in him to different expectations from those any prediction of behaviour leads to, it follows that when they understand " He'll fall in love " it means to them also more than any story about behaviour, leads in them to different expectations. And your solicitous friend, if he knows English and understands " You'll feel it all ", will, like you, expect you to feel it all, however quiet you lie. In general, when other people understand a psychological statement such as " Smith will see an hallucinatory dagger to-morrow ", the state- ment means to them more, leads them to expect more, than any story about how Smith will look and what he'll do. But now, since how Smith looks, what he does, and what he would do are the most that any of us ever really know about him, it follows that we don't ever really know what his state of mind is, and wouldn't know even if we were a great deal better informed about how he looks and so on than we ever are. White. This conclusion is as shocking as the denial of the premisses which led to it. Never know that a child is pleased? never know that a man is worried? I'd sooner say that all that " Smith is in pain " means to people who aren't Smith is that Smith is wounded or sick and groans. No doubt " Smith will be in pain by to-morrow " has a different effect on a hearer from " Smith will be complaining of pain by to-morrow ", and a very different effect from "This body (Smith's) will be complaining of pain by to-morrow ". But, after all, " There's a leprechaun in this watch " has a different effect from " This watch sings fairy songs and disappears on Midsummer Night ", and " Through this wire runs a current of power " has a different effect from " This wire is attached to a battery at one end and a tram at the other and the tram moves ". Were we to allow this difference to make us say, "The presence of the current is one thing, its effects another ", then we should have people saying, " When one reflects on what it is one really knows about electricity one has to confess that one doesn't ever really know that it takes the form of a current. All one knows is that certain wires exhibit a regular pattern of electrical phenomena ". At once others will say, " Nonsense. To know the latter is to know the former ". Now, what we saw in this case, was that this conflict between Sceptics and Phenomenalists is removed not by proving the one wrong and the other right, but by investigating certain of the causes of each one's saying what he does. And what we found was that a careful description of those differences between the 2</page><page sequence="18">18 JOHN WISDOM: use of " There's a current in this wire " and " If this wire is attached to a tram, a bell or a light they will go ", which led the Sceptic to say, " The current is one thing, its manifestations another; we know only the manifestations "-a careful descrip- tion of these differences leaves us quite willing to say of " This wire rings a bell, drives a tram, etc., but is there an invisible current in it ? " that it is not a real question. At the same time, a careful description of those likenesses between the -use of " There's a current in this wire " and " If this wire is connected to a bell, etc.", which led the Phenomenalist to say, " To carry a current just is to exhibit a certain stimulus-reaction pattern ", leaves us willing to say that it is not a merely verbal question. The two careful descriptions are the same. For a careful descrip- tion of the likenesses involves, e.g. noting their differences from the likeness between a sentence in one language and its translation in another, and it involves, e.g. noticing how there are circum- stances in which it is conventional to answer " Is there a current in this wire ? " with " I don't know ", when it is not conventional to answer in this way the question " Does the wire give the electrical reactions ? " The circumstances are those in which the wire responds in some typical electrical ways and fails to respond in others. And a careful description of- the differences will involve these points, but if it's careful it will involve also explaining that the differences are quite unlike the differences between " A current of water runs in this pipe " and " The events at either end of this pipe exhibit a hydraulic stimulus reaction pattern ". It will emphasise the likeness of the question, " Is there a current in this wire ? ", asked when the wire gives all signs of such a current, to the question, " I suppose the poor old average man takes shelter when the siren goes. But why should he, for he can hardly be killed can he ? " And isn't this the right procedure in the controversy " Surely consciousness is something more than its bodily manifestations ? And yet is it ? " ? However often it is proved that " Smith will be colour- blind " means more than that he will crash the trains, etc., and that it means the same to the rest of us as it does to Smith, people will return to the assertion of the paradoxical opposites of these conclusions. Every time I take his pieces by the rules of chess he replaces them on the board. Maybe it's not chess he's playing. And why not? Do we want everlastingly to be reminded of what we do say ? Do we want everlastingly forced upon us that particular grouping of the infinity of individuals which results from the use of the most usual linguistic machine ? So many of us welcome philosophical paradoxes because in them</page><page sequence="19">OTHER MINDS. 19 we find what we "have often thought but ne'er so well expressed ". Philosophy has been described by Wittgenstein as descriptive, and Stephenson and Wisdom do something towards elaborating this in MIND, 187 and 188. (Note here the Idiosyncracy Plati- tude, " The only correct answer to a metaphysical question, 'What is an X?' is 'An X ' ".) This comparison of " What is a philosopher ? ", "What is an art critic ? " to " What is a reptile ? ", " What is love ? " is first rate. But the last questions you will notice are best answered by the poets. And they are allowed poetic licence. They don't rely wholly on that. That techniqiue is blended with the detailed description of the concrete occasion.1 But they don't hesitate to say that love is what it's not, a disease, a religion, a moment of immortality.2 And, saying what they say, we can feel why they say what they say. And that's enough. The poetry of love, of God, of woman, is not an incorrect reply to a question, nor even an incomplete reply, though it's never finished. Saying what they say, we can feel why they say it. That's how to settle the dispute "In love does the individual die or is he born into a new life? " That is how we settled the disputes about the average man, the invisible leprechaun, the invisible current and the wind. These conflicts were all of the form: " It is something other than its manifestations, we know only these, so we can't know its nature or existence ", versus " We know its existence and nature-east or west, positive or negative, irritable or amiable, still courageous or not-we know only its manifestations, so it must be these ".3 They were dissolved by entering into them. Surely the conflict: " Consciousness is other than its bodily manifestations-' Smith will be colour-blind' means more than 'Smith will fail in colour tests '-in others we know nothing but these manifestations, so we can't know its nature or existence in others " versus " We know that Bobby feels sick and therefore of the nature and existence of conscious- ness, in others we know only its manifestations, so it must in others at least be nothing but its manifestations ", can be dissolved in the same way ? Can't we come to see that though " He has a picture in his head " differs in meaning from " He acts just as if he had a picture in his head " this difference is I "Therefore the love which us doth bind ", Marvel, Definition of Love; " Once did my thoughts both ebb and flow ", Anon, The Heritage of Poetry, p. 80. 2 R Browning, The Spell. "0 moment, one and infinite." 3 W. E. Johnson, Logic, Part II, p. 81.</page><page sequence="20">20 JOHN WISDOM: so different from the difference between "He has a stone in his bladder " and " He acts as though he has a stone in his bladder ", that though the latter difference prevents knowledge of the symptoms giving knowledge of the cause the former difference does not ? In this way we should come to see that though knowledge of a picture in Smith's mind is not like knowledge that a picture is in a room when we have looked, it is also not like " knowledge " that a picture is in a room when we haven't looked but might have. In this way we should come to see how " Smith gives all signs of having a mental picture in his head but has he ? " is a mock question which is the first move in the game of describing the peculiar use of " mental picture " as opposed to the use of " valuable picture ", just as "This gives all signs of carrying an invisible current but does it ?" is a mock question which is the first move in the game of describing the peculiar use of 'invisible current' as opposed to ' swift current '. Black. But, for the seventy-seventh time, these cases are different. In the case of the current and also in the case of the leprechaun we could say that the difference in meaning between " There's a current in this wire " and " This wire gives all signs of carrying a current " is such as to make the question "This wire gives all signs of carrying a current but is there one, there's none to be seen ? " a mock question, because we could say that the dispute, " This wire carries an invisible current ", " No. It gives all signs of carrying a current but it doesn't ", is not a factual dispute when the disputants are agreed upon all the signs. And we could say this because we could say that when the dis- putants agreed utterly upon literally all the signs past, present and to come, then the dispute reflected no difference in expecta- tion but only a difference in notation and mnemonic picture. Now, what we have just recalled is, (1) that "Smith will be colour-blind to-morrow " means more to Smith than " To-morrow Smith will give all signs of being colour-blind ", and that this difference in meaning is a difference in the expectations the two sentences lead to; (2) that " Smith will be colour-blind to-morrow " doesn't mean something different to us from what it means to Smith. It follows that "Smith will be colour-blind to-morrow " means more to us than "To-morrow Smith will give all signs of being colour-blind ". And that this difference in meaning is a difference in expe'ctation. We noticed that we say that children don't fully understand a statement to the effect that another person has a certain feeling until they have felt that feeling themselves and thus would know what to expect if told that they</page><page sequence="21">OTHER MINDS. 21 were going to feel that way to-morrow and thus know what to expect for a man who is told that he will feel that way to-morrow. Consequently, the dispute as to whether to-morrow behind a face and behaviour, e.g. smiles and clever talk, there will or will not be a mental process, is a real question; because one who says there will be and one who says there will not be have different expecta- tions. And this is the mark of what even you deign to call serious, genuine, real questions. Now, the trouble is that the only expectations about the fulfilment of which the disputants will be able to make sure to-morrow are the expectations of the smiles and clever talk, of the sights and sounds, they both expect. That is, they will not know whether what further the one expected and the other did not, did or did not come about. One can never really know what is going on in the minds of others.
