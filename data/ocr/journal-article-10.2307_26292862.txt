Absolon. It is a fragment of a decorated smoother bearing an engraving that has often been interpreted as a grouping of anthropomorphs. The artefact was an object of exchange in the course of history, and is now curated by the Moravian Museum. KEY WORDS: Portable art – Engraved smoother – Gourdan Cave – Magdalenian INTRODUCTION primitives, and were not taken seriously, just as the whole contemporary young prehistoric research. That is why he The bone engraving that has come to be known as the abandoned this field of study, and began to focus on “Rangée d’individus marchant” (Figure 1) was found in palaeontology. This fact as well probably accounts for a 1885 during excavation in the Magdalenian strata of the “loss” in value of the discussed artefact, and later maybe Gourdan Cave (Haute-Garonne, France) by the French also for an easy sale thereof. palaeontologist E. Harlé, who was in charge of research in It was the Czech palaeontologist K. Maška, who had the cave (Soubeyran 1994). The fact that the object came to bought the object for his personal collection. The contact light at a very early stage in the evolution of prehistory as a between the scholars E. Harlé and K. Maška is also discipline has marked perceptions concerning its confirmed by J. Skutil (1939). Following up further history significance. The period in which the artefact was found was of movements of this artefact, Maška’s collection was still a time of “wavering” on the authenticity of prehistoric purchased in 1909 by the Moravian Museum in Brno.

Absolon reported on this transaction in his article published The genuineness and originality of both types of prehistoric in the journal Acta Musei Moraviensis (Absolon 1926). The art – mobiliary and parietal – were not recognised inheritance left by K. Absolon also contained a 1932 letter simultaneously (Moro Abadía, Gonzáles Morales 2004). At from Count Bégouën telling about: “...re-exchange of the the time when the artefact was found, the discussion on the object from Gourdan for 2 painted pebbles, one flat authenticity of parietal art was still in full progress, whereas harpoon...” (private archive of Prof. K. Absolon). The object mobile art was no longer doubted (Lartet, Christy 1865-75). was probably not inventoried in the Moravian Museum, since These facts had a strong influence on the perception of value we cannot find any mention of it. This explains why the of the above objects. E. Harlé was part of this debate since Moravian Museum gave a negative answer to H. Delporte, he also participated in the discussion concerning the curator of the Museum in Saint-Germain-en-Laye (France), authenticity of paintings in the Altamira Cave (discovered when he asked whether the object was in collections of the 1879), casting doubt on their antiquity.

Skutil (1961) in the Bulletin de la Société préhistorique française. Here is specified that the artefact was part of the collection stock of the Moravian Museum in Brno. Despite that, in a work by  M. Chollot-Varagnac (1980) we can read that the artefact was not stored in the Musée d’Antiquitées Nationales but the place of its deposition is not mentioned here. The author implies that the engraving may have been confused with some other item, even if the publication by Skutil clearly describes the genesis of its journey. J.-P. Duhard (1991, 1992, 1995), too, lists the FIGURE 1. Relevé drawing of the artefact by J. Pilloy (Duhard 1992). place of deposition of the artefact as unknown. while Valoch and employees of the Moravian Museum were taking an inventory of bequests left by K. Absolon in his flat. ARTEFACT DESCRIPTION The artefact represents the distal part of a decorated PUBLICATION HISTORY smoother manufactured of bone, more precisely of a reindeer rib (Rangifer tarandus, determined by G. Dreslerová) When dealing with the artefact’s publication history, we find (Figures 3–4). The dimensions are as follows: length 63 mm, out that it was first published in 1907 in the work L’art pendant width 14.5 mm, thickness 3.8 mm. The object wass made by l’âge du renne by E. Piette (Figure 2), who led the research in the technique of splitting the rib along grooves (Averbouh, Gourhan Cave in 1871–1875 (catalogue). Piette presents the Buisson 1996). On the top side (that with the engraving, object in this book as part of his collection, although it where the original surface of the bone is preserved) we can probably actually belonged to the collection of E. Harlé. Later observe technological traces in form of scraping marks, publications repeated Piette’s claim to ownership, again which were made prior to engraving (Figure 5). Raclage ascribing it to Piette’s collection (Reinach 1913, Saccasyn may have occurred as part of the processing of the bone for della Santa 1947). The artefact was often published in subsequent monographs on prehistoric art, without specifying the place of its deposition. Historical details about the FIGURE 3.

Absolon explains the scene again as a row of picturesque with a coat of conservation substance, so that the character of sediment cannot be determined. Whether or not it was an intentional act, the sediment detected inside the engraving highlights the entire image, making it all the more distinct.  The artefact is well preserved except for an old fracture (Figure 7) that arose after the final decorative modifications of the bone. Therefore it may have been caused by the object’s function or during its use. According to the usual interpretation and the name as well, the engraving represents 9 individuals in a row, 8 of them complete and 1 fragmentary. INTERPRETATION OF THE ENGRAVING E. Piette wrote in 1907: “...we cannot identify the subject of this engraving with certainty. It seems that the engraver wanted to depict a row of individuals walking one behind the FIGURE 9.
