The guardian-spirit quest was, as we know, common among the Prairie and Plains Indians.' The Prairie Indians of the Missouri Valley knew it in approximately the same form that it had among the Eastern Woodlands Indians (the later Iroquois and the eastern Canadian Algonkians excepted), as a fasting ordeal for young boys resulting in the vision of a spirit that henceforth served as a supernatural protector. The more nomadic Plains Indians, however, acquired their super- natural patrons often at a mature age, also through fasting and vision experiences. A man could repeatedly seek guardian spirits throughout his life, a woman often after menopause. This pattern was charac- teristic for the Plains and Eastern Basin Indians. For America as a whole, the more common pattern was, however, the puberty vision 1 In this connection, it is useful to distinguish between these two cultural partitions as A. L. Kroeber, Horst Hartmann, and I have done in previous writings. See A. L.

The wide diffusion of this type of guardian-vision quest makes it quite obvious that the Plains-Basin visions, experienced at a mature age, represent a deviation from the common pattern. We may speculate as to the causes of this deviation, but it is difficult to find any other reason than the reformulation of cultural patterns in the western Plains area during the eighteenth century or so. The expansion of later Plains culture to the western periphery of the Plains area brought the Shoshoni groups east of the Rocky Moun- tains into the Plains ideological mold.2 The present Wind River Shoshoni were, before the beginning of reservation days in the 1870s, split up into three major populations: the mounted buffalo hunters (kucundika, "buffalo eaters"), the mountain groups (tukudika, "meat" or "sheep eaters"), and the more or less acculturated groups along the emigrant trails (nicknamed haivodika, "pigeon eaters").3 Of these divi- sions, the Buffaloeaters were organized like the "typical" Plains tribes4 and partook of their way of life, while the timid Sheepeaters remained partly Basin, partly Plateau in their economic and social organization,5 and the acculturated groups in the Fort Bridger country had a mixed white and Indian form of life.6 The most numerous and influential of these populations were the buffalo hunters, known in the literature as the Snakes or Plains Shoshoni. It is debatable whether they were thoroughly ingrained with Plains culture or had only a superficial veneer of it;7 my own standpoint, expressed many years ago, is that their culture had both a Plains and Basin aspect.8 Under chiefs like the Comanche Yellow 2 See D.

Economically, however, they divided their attention between bison and small-game hunting and seed and root gathering, somewhat along Basin-Plateau lines. Their religious outlook was part Plains, part Basin. Considering the fact that all the Eastern Shoshoni obviously origi- nated in the Great Basin area, and that Plains culture as stereotyped in our handbooks is a late occurrence-although based on ancient foundations-the Plains features in Shoshoni culture must be judged as comparatively recent. It is therefore instructive to study traces of Shoshoni religion from this perspective. We could expect that old religious traits that have been covered by Plains religious expressions for a long time would break through again when the dominating Plains cultural complex eventually receded. And indeed, this is exactly what happened with respect to the Shoshoni vision patterns. II At the turn of the last century, the vision quest was still performed in the way it had been done among the Shoshoni during the heyday of their Plains existence. As in most other Plains tribes, visions were deliberately sought at lonely places by men of all ages after adolescence. The vision quest required fasting, endurance, suffering from cold, thirst and hunger, and the expectation of possible attacks from dangerous animals. Not everybody received a guardian spirit in this way, but to many persistent and audacious vision seekers, a guardian spirit, puha, revealed itself in the form of an animal, an anthropomorphic being, a ghost, or even a star or a lake. The spirit endowed his client with his own particular medicine, which was thereafter symbolized by the blessed man through his medicine bag, his face painting, his feather arrangements or other adornments. The spirit gave his client a song and rules of clothing, behavior, daily occupation, and so on. Most important were the instructions concerning taboos to be respected by the visionary: taboos against certain kinds of food; taboos against using certain implements, like knives of steel; taboos against visiting certain places; and so on. Visionaries who were blessed by particular spirits known to possess curing powers were recognized as medicine men (puhagan). Most characteristic for the Eastern Shoshoni were their ideas of the spirit localities. Whereas in theory spirits could be found almost every- where in nature, the guardian spirits almost invariably revealed them- 36</page><page sequence="4">History of Religions selves at the rock drawings in the Rocky Mountain foothills.9 The inherent powers of these spiritual localities were considered to be so extraordinarily potent that persons who happened to make their sleep- ing quarters in their proximity, without knowing they were there, received guardian spirits and supernatural powers in their dreams. The numerous rock-drawing sites in the Wind River and Big Horn areas of western Wyoming constitute one of the three most celebrated groups of sites in the region west of the Mississippi Valley.'? In this rock art, most of which can be derived from the Fremont culture of the Great Basin area,"1 there are mountain walls and boulders deco- rated with both zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figures, and a blend of both. Besides early, realistic animal drawings-portraying mountain sheep, deer, and other animals-the observer finds other figures whose identities are less clear: some horned beings, others vaguely anthropomorphic surrounded by "electric" zigzag lines, and still others like birds (eagles, thunderbirds?). In the Dinwoody area, it is possible to identify three styles that have been superimposed upon each other; the Early Hunting Style, depicting animals and some human figures, obviously hunters; the Interior Line Style, with more complicated figure drawings joined with intricate geometric patterns; and the Plains (Late Hunting) Style.12 The first of these styles is clearly connected with the old Eurasian-American hunting ceremoni- alism, while the second style has a Basin (Fremont) character and thus represents a Shoshoni heritage. The Plains style was apparently introduced with the accumulating Plains culture influences. To the Shoshoni, all these drawings were pictures of spirits, pictures that the spirits had made themselves.'3 One old informant told me in 1948, "Cliff drawings are very sacred, no real Indian wants to copy them. White people do it, but I don't know what happens to them. 9 Some medicine men were reputed to achieve powers also at other places, such as graves, but power at rock drawings ("mountain power") was held in particular respect. 10 David Gebhard, The Rock Art of Dinwoody, Wyoming (Santa Barbara: University of California Press, 1969), p. 8; see also Campbell Grant, Rock Art of the American Indian (New York: Thomas Y. Crowell, 1967), p. 131 ff. I Gebhard, p. 22. 12 Ibid., p. 15 ff. 13 Th. B. Comstock, geologist in an exploring expedition to northwestern Wyoming in 1873, reported that one of the Indian guides, Pinatsi, interpreted some rock figures as not drawn by Shoshoni and as describing fights between Shoshoni and Cheyenne Indians. See W. A. Jones, Report upon the Reconnaissance of Northwestern Wyoming, Including Yellowstone National Park, Made in the Summer of 1873 (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1875), p. 268 ff. It is possible that Pinatsi-who, judging from his name, might have been a Bannock-wanted to draw attention away from sacred places and therefore mitigated their importance in front of the white men. 37</page><page sequence="5">Peril of Visions The cliff drawings were made for the Indians. The invisible beings who made the drawings are in the mountains in the summertime. Next month [September] when the weather turns cold they will come down and work invisibly in the night. They are still active today: in the summer, up in the mountains, in the winter, down at the cliff drawings." Together with younger, but very knowledgeable, Shoshoni, I examined several of the rock-drawing sites. It was interesting to watch them point out what they considered to be new drawings since their last visits to these places. The old Shoshoni just quoted told me the following story about the origins of spiritual experiences at rock drawings: Many generations ago there was a warrior-he was not a medicine man-who walked away from his camp to a foothill. It was in the daytime. He was lying there on the top of the hill, spying around. Then far away he saw an appari- tion. First he didn't see what it was, but it came closer, and finally he saw it was an Indian who was approaching, walking on the ground. He had a buffalo robe over his shoulders. The apparition placed himself before him and asked, "Do you know who I am?" The Shoshoni said, "No, I don't know who you are." The spirit said, "I am puha [supernatural power]. You see the drawings on the cliffs beneath: I am the one who has drawn them. I want you to return tonight, go to the drawings and stay there. You should bring with you an eagle wing, for power will be bestowed on you through this wing. You must remain on the place, whatever happens. I shall come back to you again." Then the spirit turned around, went away and finally disappeared at the horizon. The same evening, after the warrior had woken up from his long trance, he returned to camp. He did not tell anybody what had happened to him. After dark the warrior took his eagle wing and went to the drawings as he had been instructed. He made a bed for himself, lay down, and waited for the power to appear. Soon the ground started shaking, but he remained there, for he understood something was going to happen. Suddenly he went to sleep, in the middle of all thundering and shaking, or passed into a trance. From the east, where earlier this day puha had arrived, the same spirit appeared again. He came closer and closer, and then stopped before him. The spirit was dressed in different robes, beautiful otter skins and buffalo skins, and he carried an eagle wing. "You have done exactly what I told you to do," he said. "I have seen that you are a courageous man, for you withstood all efforts to frighten you away. Now I will grant you medicine power to cure the sick. Every time you cure anybody you should wear the same dress that I have. You shall have four or eight persons in the same place where you are, and all of you shall sing the song that I give to you. Follow my instructions, and you will be able to heal the sick." The spirit turned around and went away. This is the origin of the rock drawings. The rules of this origin legend have been respected by subsequent generations of vision seekers. The legend legitimized the vision quest 38</page><page sequence="6">History of Religions among a people that had changed from Basin to Plains culture. The legend itself is patterned on an origin-tale model that is well known among Plains Indians. The relevance of the origin legend in modern times is expressed in the perpetual reshaping of rock figures by the spirits. I was informed that some picture drawings might become obliterated by rains but that the spirits always peck them in again. Every year, I was told, more and more rock drawings are being made by the spirits. (Com- pare below, however, how many spirits have abandoned their ancient drawing places.) Shoshoni Indians described to me how they had heard knocking sounds from the rock drawings. When they had approached them, the sounds ceased; when they withdrew again, they could hear them after a little while. All of this bears witness to the concept of a never-ceasing relationship to the supernatural world, a relationship so typical for the Plains Indians. The procedures of the vision quest followed closely the pattern set by the origin legend: ritual bathing and smoking, endurance for several days and nights-if necessary-under the cliff drawings, courage in the face of threatening noises and wild animals, and, finally, sub- mission to weird spiritual apparitions. Some informants assert that the candidate prayed to the animal picture whose particular powers and gifts he wanted to achieve. Others deny this, pointing out that he could never know what powers the spirit would give. After all, the spirit took the animal form that pleased him. It is difficult to have a definite opinion in this matter. However, most pronouncements seem to indicate that the shape of the animal in the vision had a direct bearing on the supernatural qualities that the client received. III The vision-quest pattern functioned well into the twentieth century, having apparently been for some centuries the dominating way to create contacts with guardian spirits. There are legions of stories of more or less successful vision quests, all of them regarding persons who are now dead, or long since dead. A prominent feature of these stories is the difficulties, the risks, the dangers in seeking visions. Even the visit itself to the rock drawings was considered dangerous in later times, and during my field visits many Shoshoni dared not go. It seems that this feature is more accentuated in Shoshoni accounts than in other Plains Indian vision reports. Even after he received miraculous power in a vision, the health and well-being of the visionary was not guaranteed. The vision-quest accounts tell us of many individuals who, though blessed by a spirit, afterward lost their power because of some infringement of a taboo given by the spirit. Accordingly, they 39</page><page sequence="7">Peril of Visions FIG. 1.-Rock drawings from the Wind River area. Horned beings in par- ticular were interpreted by the Shoshoni as manifestations of pandzo:aBits. were punished by the spirit, lost their sight, were struck lame, or even lost their minds. During my first visit to the Shoshoni, there was a mentally disturbed man whose condition the Shoshoni ascribed to a most dangerous vision of the pandzo:aBits, a gigantic ogre (fig. 1). According to one of my most knowledgeable and reliable infor- mants, there appeared around 1918 a medicine man who condemned the vision quest at rock drawings. His name was William Surrel or mu:t6ingaip, "noseholes." He was an old Indian soldier and known to speak good English. As a medicine man he possessed excellent powers, and he successfully cured many people. One informant, himself a medicine man, remembered how Surrel used to hold a mirror behind his client's back, with the glass part directed to the back. He looked into the mirror, and if he did not find any faults in the back, he held the mirror in front of the client's chest, which he examined in the same way. 40</page><page sequence="8">History of Religions On one occasion he received a vision, apparently during a dream, of an otter spirit informing him that the rock drawings had no good purpose: they were drawn by an evil power that was trying to entice people to die. This evil power was pandzo:aBits, "water ghost," the huge, man-eating monster known to haunt desolate places. This mon- ster could show itself on the rock drawings in different shapes, but always with horns on his head or with his hands stretched upward. The person who was favored by the spirits depicted on the rocks received their powers but was destined to die in a few years. William Surrel's revelation completely overturned Shoshoni atti- tudes to religion. The vision quest was eventually abandoned. How quickly it was abandoned is difficult to say, but during my field studies in the 1940s and 1950s, only a few medicine men were still reputed to have received supernatural powers at rock drawings. It would seem that the drawings had gradually become bad medicine, except for those few. Besides being recognized as the creations of pandzo:aBits, rock drawings were also said to have been the work of the trickster Coyote (izapb) or even the Devil. (The last was, of course, a Christian reinterpretation.) The majority of the Indians with whom I visited the rock drawings felt that most pictures portrayed pandzo:aBits. Owing to the devaluation of the vision quest, other ways of receiving supernatural powers gained in importance. The following five ways have remained the most important. 1. Spiritual endowment through inheritance. This was less common. Once in a while it happened that a man inherited his dead father's guardian spirit. However, the transmission was not automatic. The spirit ordered his new client to construct another medicine bundle (since the father's had followed him into the grave). The new bundle often received completely different contents. 2. Transference of medicine. A man could not hand over his medi- cine power to another man unless he willed it away on his deathbed. (Recently a medicine man still alive actually transferred his medicines to a Crow friend, but in this case he was following a Crow pattern that he had adopted.) Together with the medicine, the donator also bequeathed the spirit's instructions for using it. There was no selling of the medicine. 3. Spiritual endowment through lightning visions. Sometimes a person was struck by lightning, or a stroke of lightning struck close by him, so that he became unconscious and had a vision. The famous medicine man John Trehero was blessed this way. 4. Spiritual endowment through dreams. Since 1918, nocturnal dreams have been the most common way of establishing rapport with supernatural powers. The medicine man Tudey Roberts, for instance, 41</page><page sequence="9">Peril of Visions emphasized that all the contacts he had with the spirits occurred in nightly dreams. He said, "I have never got any power from the rock drawings, and I have never tried to get any. I don't want to try, for the old-timers said it is a dangerous thing to try, and I am afraid. But puha come in my dreams, they live somewhere out among the hills, and they come to me of [their own] free will, for they like me. There are not many people they come to. On the other side of the Big Wind River, at a certain place, many of them are gathered. There are [also] many of them south of the Sage Creek up in the mountains." It is interesting to note that Tudey Roberts did not denounce the rock drawings as being bad for vision quests-he simply dared not use them. In fact, he told me they could give efficient powers for different things, like healing the sick. He held the opinion that pandzo:aBits could grant such powers and was no evil power in itself. Tudey was just as sure that the otter was the best puha who could do wondrous things. Dreams were not only roads of access to spiritual beings. Dreams could also reveal events to come, locate lost persons and objects, and give wise counsels. 5. Spiritual endowment through Sun Dance visions (or dreams). Fasting, listening to the monotonous drumming, intense monoideism, and the general exhaustion of participating in the Sun Dance could bring about visionary experiences similar to those in the vision quest. Several of my informants talked with me about falling into a trance or about having a sacred dream during the performance of the Sun Dance. One of them, himself an ardent believer in the dance (and most critical of the rock-drawing visions), assured me that "many times the Indians have fainted from thirst [in the Sun Dance]; when they wake up again they say that they have drunk spiritual water and that they are not thirsty any more." The same informant had himself seen many dancers fall down. "While dancing they see something flying back and forth: that is a spiritual eagle. Many times I have seen the dancers, as it were, catch them [the spirits] with their arms, and then fall backwards or aside-but never forwards. They always fall to the ground without being hurt, and they lose their consciousness. They lie stiff during their trance, and without breathing. Afterwards they have told us what they experienced." However, such dramatic occurrences have not taken place since about 1920, if we may believe this informant. Most contacts with the supernatural world occur when the exhausted dancers take a nap in the Sun Dance lodge after a period of intensive dancing. The event is not supposed to be expected. The dancer certainly prays during the ceremony, but he does not ask for a guardian spirit, nor does he ask to become a medicine man. "If the power comes, it is pure coinci- 42</page><page sequence="10">History of Religions dence," one Shoshoni remarked. The appearance of puha may have two possible consequences. It can cure the dancer's own weakened body without giving him the power to cure others; the dancer then usually receives such an infusion of power that he will have a long life. I was told that only the Sun Dance could work such a miracle. Or else the dancer receives instruction by the power (puha is both supernatural power and guardian spirit) to cure other people, to become in truth a medicine man. I never heard that other supernatural gifts have been granted in the Sun Dance. The ceremony is today thoroughly integrated with the healing complex. Although power cannot be sought in the Sun Dance but is bestowed entirely by the grace of God (tam apo, "our father"), it is possible to premeditate its coming in Sun Dance lodgelike structures. An old Shoshoni living in Pinedale, Wyoming, identified the enigmatic circu- lar stone structures, the so-called medicine wheels, with the sacred Sun Dance lodge. To him, the spokes of these wheels corresponded to the "rays" in the sand of the Sun Dance lodge created by the shuffling movements of the dancers back and forth between the peri- phery of the lodge and the center pole. As a young man he had prayed at a medicine wheel in the Pinedale country. He went up to the mountain where it is situated, bathed in a creek, prayed, and made his sleeping place between two of the spokes, arbitrarily chosen. During the night, the spirits gave him Sun Dance and prayer songs. Such incidents are, however, exceptions. The rule has been that Sun Dance power comes unsought, spontaneously. The same goes for spirit revelations in lightning visions and nocturnal dreams. In short, most supernatural encounters after William Surrel's "reformation" have been spontaneous and not ritually prepared. This way of receiv- ing visions seems to be more in line with old Shoshoni culture than the vision quest. IV The abandonment of the vision quest at the time of the First World War was no accidental occurrence but an integrated part of the devel- opment of Shoshoni society and religion. Shoshoni culture and society seem to have developed, broadly speaking, in the following way. For many hundred years the later Eastern Shoshoni must have been part of the Numic-speaking peoples' culture and society in the Great Basin. Since that time, the Shoshoni have preserved the extensive economic pattern of collecting seeds and berries and hunting smaller game, a pattern characteristic of the Basin groups. Similarly, they ought to have shared with their Basin neigh- bors a little formalized, family-centered social organization. In those times, Shoshoni religion had probably rather vague ritual expressions, 43</page><page sequence="11">Peril of Visions with thanksgiving round dances and an elementary shamanism among its more observable features.14 The location of the Eastern Shoshoni in the transition zone between the Basin and Plains physiographic areas evidently had an ecological impact which led to cultural change. The more northerly groups spread through a mountainous terrain where they partly adapted to a Plateau hunting and fishing culture.'5 The more populous southern groups adjusted to a buffalo-hunting economy and adopted a preequestrian Plains cultural pattern that, with the arrival of horses, partly changed and facilitated their expansion over land. During the eighteenth cen- tury and in the beginning of the nineteenth, these Shoshoni adapted to the newly introduced Plains culture represented by Algonkian (Arapaho, Atsina, Cheyenne, Blackfoot) and Siouan (Crow, Hidatsa) tribes.16 There is every reason to assume that the vision patterns changed with these cultural modifications. In the Great Basin the predominat- ing or even exclusive way to receive guardian spirits and supernatural messages was through unsought dreams; the recipients were, in the southwestern parts of the area, almost invariably medicine men or shamans.'7 On the eastern periphery of the Basin area (Idaho and Utah) Shoshoni, Bannock, and Gosiute presented a somewhat deviat- ing pattern: most dreams of power came unsought, but some were sought-"especially on mountains," writes Steward, "a practice per- haps reflecting Plains influence."'8 It is characteristic here that sought powers were considered less powerful than others. Over a period of time that roughly coincides with the nineteenth century, the Eastern Shoshoni represented the Eastern Plains cultural 14 See J. H.

This was, however, also the period when the Sun Dance was first practiced.'9 The Sun Dance seems to have taken over many of the religious functions of involuntary dreaming. Visionary dreams occurred regularly in the Sun Dance of old.20 The downfall of independent political existence, the end of the buffalo, and the introduction of reservation life meant a major shift in the direction of Shoshoni life values. There was no further need for supernatural help in war and hunting; health problems became a focus of religious activities, and individual and ethnic survival in a non-Indian world became a main concern. The failure of the Ghost Dance possibly accentuated this development. It had definite repercus- sions for the vision pattern. First of all, the vision quest, adjusted to the hunter's and warrior's way of life, fell into disrepute. The dangers inherent in vision seeking outgrew its positive gains. In abandoning the vision quest, the Sho- shoni returned to a pre-Plains, basically Basin, cultural tradition in which involuntary nightly dreams constituted the main inroad for procuring a guardian spirit and enlisting supernatural help. As I said, when I first visited the Shoshoni in 1948, only a few medicine men were said to have sought visions at the rock drawings. Quite another matter is the way some who had unknowingly spent the night close to rock drawings had received supernatural power. Second, the Sun Dance visions and dreams acquired a new impor- tance after about 1890. Shimkin rightly points out that at that time the disillusionment with their existential conditions and their general misery turned the Shoshoni toward an increased concern over illness and communal unity.21 The Sun Dance became an instrument of healing and at the same time it was reinterpreted with Christian sym- bolism-missions had by now been founded on the Wind River Reser- vation.22 Joseph Jorgensen argues that the Sun Dance was restructured about 1890 into a redemptive movement that could be put together with other nativistic movements. He labels it the "Sun Dance reli- gion"-a label that in fact I had used earlier.23 However, according to 19 D. B. Shimkin, "The Wind River Shoshone Sun Dance," Bureau of American Ethnology, Bulletin 151 (Washington, D.C., 1953), p. 409 ff.; see also my "The Develop- ment of the Plains Indian Sun Dance," in Perennitas, ed.

See my "Pagan and Christian Elements in the 45</page><page sequence="13">Peril of Visions my understanding, the new Sun Dance is no redemptive religion but a contraction of Shoshoni religious ideas that were now concentrated in the Sun Dance. In this remodeled ceremony, dreaming attained great importance.24 The dreams and visions in the Sun Dance lodge became the main vehicle for gaining supernatural power.25 The whole "vision complex" was absorbed by the Sun Dance. Both of these trends, the return to a Basin vision pattern and the strong inclination to create supernatural contacts in the Sun Dance lodge-where the powers appeared most often spontaneously in dreams and occasionally in spontaneous visions during trance and coma-prepared the ground for William Surrel's important otter vision. A third factor was certainly the weakening grip of the old traditional religion as a result of Christian missions, the impact of white culture, the destruction of the old tribal ways, and the opening of new inter- tribal perspectives.26 One of my informants told me that since the young Indians had learned the white man's way through Christian missionaries, the supernatural powers had become scared of the Chris- tian cross and moved away. Thus the rock drawings above the so- called Washakie's meadows on the Wind River Reservation are faint today, for the abundant powers that had roamed there before have now gone farther into the mountain regions to find new locations.27 In this way the Shoshoni visionary pattern has changed. But plus qa change, plus c'est la meme chose: the Shoshoni have turned back to their ancestral visionary pattern.

This neglect obstructs the visionaries from receiving the clear visions that the old-timers had. 46</page></plain_text>
