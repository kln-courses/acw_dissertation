<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAPTER l8 Does Size Matter? Miniature Pottery Vessels in Minoan Peak Sanctuaries by Iphiyenia Tournavitou In the Bronze Aegean, miniatures as a class encompass a wide range of votive objects including, apart from pottery, other types of artifacts such as offering tables, altars, lamps, double axes, human and animal figurines, and human limbs, all of which seem to have had specific roles in ritual practices at cult sites.1 The role of miniature pottery vessels in ritual contexts in general is usually taken for granted and therefore their role in specific cult sites, such as Minoan peak sanctuaries, has been mostly left out of the, albeit general, discussions on peak sanctuaries. The term "miniature" in the archaeological jargon is often considered self-explanatory, and has therefore been loosely applied to both small and minuscule versions of normal-sized artifacts. The difficulties associated with laying out strict specifications for the definition of ceramic "miniatures" are related to the inherent relativity of the criteria applied both to optimal dimensions, i.e., the degree of the miniaturization,2 and to the degree of variation as regards technical aspects, i.e., whether the miniature pottery is handmade or wheelmade, local or imported. Miniature versions of ceramic vessel forms will therefore be defined here in more general terms as any vessels of which the size and, occasionally, the form dictate a primarily nonutilitarian function. The term "utilitarian" in this context implies the fullest possible exploitation of the functional potential or properties of the corresponding nonminiature forms.3 Assuming that the basics of function and form, both primary and modified, have been more or less established by research and common sense,4 we will concentrate on the potential use, the importance, and the 1. The term "ritual," whether reli gious or secular, will be used here with reference to artifacts and practices re lating more to symbolic values than to practical utility (Whitehouse 1996, p. ID 2. Knappett, forthcoming. 3. It is by no means suggested here that the miniaturization process neces sarily renders a vessel totally nonfunc tional. The emphasis in this definition lies rather in the comparative evalua tion of the exploitability of the two ceramic classes, always using the regular-sized version as the ultimate reference point. The most significant factor in this equation is the relation between the miniature and the canon ical. I fully agree with Knappett (forth coming) in his claim that miniaturiza tion implicitly emphasizes form over function (miniaturization as a distilla tion process minimizing functionality and increasing the intensity of form). The possibility that miniatures were used as toys, i.e., that they were in fact utilitarian objects, is in this sense irrele vant, because it only illustrates an alter native, parallel use that does not cancel the original definition?even as toys, they were not fulfilling their original potential.

The well-known topographical conditions prevailing in the vast majority of peak sanctuary sites, along with intensive post-abandonment disturbance of the area, have contributed considerably to the fragmentary state of the finds and to the disturbed state of a significant percentage of the original strata, many of which tumbled or were thrown down the hill in stages. Evidence of Minoan cult activities at the sanctuary, mostly con nected with Primary Deposition Locations (PDLs),9 was attested on seven successive terraces, five of which are located on the southern slope facing the Minoan settlement, below the more or less flat area at the top.10 Portable finds from the sanctuary were abundant, and although they seem to conform to the general specifications applicable to those of the main body of Cretan peak sanctuaries,11 they do include a number of de viations from the norm, which emphasize not only the significance of the site itself, possibly related to the local economy and the strategic position of the island, but also the idiosyncratic character of peak sanctuary cults in general. The unusually high number of bronze finds in the Kythera peak sanctuary, for example, and their uncommon preponderance over clay vo tive offerings, seems to openly contradict the data obtained from the main corpus of finds in Cretan peak sanctuaries.12 The ceramic material from the sanctuary at Ayios Yeoryios sto Vouno, which is perhaps somewhat less unorthodox than the corpus of non ceramic finds, helps us to trace the history of the site, from the modest 5.1 would like to thank J. Sakellara kis, the director of the Ayios Yeoryios sto Vouno excavations, for granting me permission to study and publish the entire Bronze Age ceramic material from the Minoan peak sanctuary. 6.

Toumavitou early remains dating to the Prepalatial and Protopalatial periods (Middle Minoan [MM] IA-MM II), through its peak in the Neopalatial era (MM IIIB-Late Minoan [LM] I), until its abandonment at the end of this period (LM IB). The vast majority of the ceramic material, 99.5% of a total of 196,010 items, is fragmentary; the complete vases, an otherwise sizable group of 994 specimens, constitute a mere 0.5% of the total.13 The Prepalatial and Protopalatial periods are represented by an extremely low number of specimens (620 out of 196,010, or 0.31% of the total), while the vast majority of the material (195,372 out of 196,010, or 99.67%) belongs to the Neopalatial era (MM IIIB-LM IB) (Fig. 18.1).14 MINIATURE POTTERY AT AYIOS YEORYIOS STO VOUNO The total number of truly miniature specimens recorded in the sanctu ary, both intact and fragmentary, represents a mere 0.77% of the extant ceramic material, an apparently insignificant quantity in terms of relative numbers.15 This low percentage definitely makes a statement concerning the overall frequency of use of miniature vessels in the peak sanctuary ritual.16 The vast majority of the material belongs to the Neopalatial period 13. The vast majority of the com plete specimens, i.e., 90.84% of the total, belongs to handleless conical cups, followed by dishes/trays, minia ture juglets, and isolated cases of birds-nest bowls, miniature rhyta, semiglobular cups, and braziers. 14. A further 18 specimens belong to the LM/Late Helladic (LH) IIIA-B period. 15.1,511 out of 196,010 examples. Of these, 1,484 examples belong to recognizable vessel types; the remaining 27 sherds derive from indeterminate open and closed shapes. 16. Frequency of occurrence or de position reflects the degree of popu larity, and to a certain extent the fre quency of use of a vessel form, a signif icant pointer to its indispensability or importance in cult (see interpretations of statistical data offered below). At the same time, it is implicitly related to the intrinsic character of the specimens involved, i.e., their use as cult equip ment or votives. The inherent uncer tainty that plagues all assessments of pottery assemblages in ritual contexts? the distinction between their use as ritual equipment or as simple votives (Whitehouse 1996, p. 22)?is even more pertinent in the case of the specific site. Various adverse circum stances, such as primary and secondary exposure to the elements and secondary displacement or breakage, render the detection of use wear almost impossi ble. Moreover, even though the better preserved specimens do not exhibit any signs of repeated use, this does not preclude their role as cult equipment employed on a single occasion. The final interpretation of the original func tion of the individual specimens, how ever tentative, will have to rely more on their form (form defines function) and on their context (deposition location) than on the presence of use wear.</page><page sequence="4">2l6 IPHIYENIA TOURNAVITOU Figure 18.2. Miniature corpus, Ayios Yeoryios sto Vouno. I. Tournavitou (MM IIIB-LM I), the Prepalatial and Protopalatial periods being repre sented by a mere 1.59% of the total (Fig. 18.2).17 The dimensions of the miniature versions in the sanctuary vary considerably according to shape,18 and the vast majority are local wheelmade products.19 The miniature specimens comprise 23 different vessel types (Table 18.1), i.e., no less than 85.18% of the 27 extant Minoan shapes in the sanctuary. This statistic demonstrates that, irrespective of numbers, almost the entire range of extant vessel types at the sanctuary was deliberately produced or reproduced in miniature form.20 The most popular specimens in the miniature corpus are first and fore most the miniature juglets (67.57%) (Fig. 18.3:a), followed by the handle less conical cups (19.25%) (Fig. 18.3:b).Two rather unexpected, but under the circumstances highly appropriate, vessel types, the rhyta and cup-rhyta, together occupy the third place with an unremarkable percentage (3.83%) (Fig. 18.3:c, d). The only other vessel types with what could be described as a respectable frequency of just above or just below 1% are jugs/amphoras (1.65%), semiglobular cups (1.58%) (Fig. 18.3:e), and bridge-spouted jars (0.99%) (Fig. 18.3:f). Although the remaining 16 specimens constitute the vast majority of the extant vessel types, they are attested in remarkably low quantities (see Table 18.1). It is quite remarkable that only two of the extant vessel types in the miniature corpus, the juglets and the miniature bird s-nest bowls, were produced exclusively in miniature form,21 while the miniature versions in three of the remaining vessel types, the cup-rhyta (85.71%), the regular rhyta (83.63%), and the multiple vessels (75%), constitute the vast majority Prepalatial-Protopalatial Neopalatial 17. Miniatures account for 24 out of 1,511 Prepalatial and Protopalatial specimens, a slightly higher percentage than that recorded for the overall cor pus. They include carinated cups (three examples), vessels with plastic decora tion (one example), handleless conical cups (19 out of 66, or 28.78% of the total MM II intact miniature speci mens), and straight-sided cups (one out of three extant miniature versions). 18. Judging by the complete speci mens, their height does not exceed 10 cm (rhyton: 9.8 cm; semiglobular cups: 3.5 cm; braziers: 2.1 cm; juglets: 6.2-8.7 cm; handleless conical cups: 2.0-3.7 cm). 19. Only two or possibly three fragmentary rhyta of the miniature class could be described as imports (K815, K836, K849), and only one other specimen (a birds-nest bowl K1031) as handmade. 20. The four vessel types not pro duced in miniature form are pithoi, kalathoi, fruitstands, and other stands. Despite the wide range of vessel shapes represented, it should be pointed out that the vast majority of the miniatures belong to only a handful of shapes (see below). 21. This despite the fact that both shapes have larger reference versions, either here (jugs) or in the general Minoan corpus.</page><page sequence="5">MINIATURE POTTERY VESSELS 21J TABLE 18.1.

The significance of these statistics relates not only to the ultimate function of the particular specimens, in this case mostly libation equipment, but could also be directly linked to the preference of miniature forms for the performance of specific ritual practices at Ayios Yeoryios sto Vouno.22 Two further classes of miniature pottery, the tripod vessels and the footed semiglobular cups, constitute an impressive 50%?60% of their re spective shape populations (see Fig. 18.4). Here again, the scale tips toward a deliberate choice in favor of the symbolic with regard to intrinsic votive practices and possibly ritual offerings. Finally, the remaining miniature vessel types, constituting the majority of the ceramic corpus, fall into two groups of identical size, in both of which the miniature versions constitute a small minority in their respective shape populations (see Fig. 18.4).23 It seems that the preferred choice for the specific ritual practices implied by extant vessel types is reversed in this case, the scale weighing in favor of the nonminiature versions. The ritual activities implied by this corpus, in descending order of popu larity, involve the pouring and/or dedication of liquid substances (juglets, jugs/amphoras, bridge-spouted jars), independently or in conjunction 22. For example, the pouring of libations with specialized equipment (see final section on rhyta and cup rhyta). 23. In the first group (semiglobular cups, bowls, basins, vessels with perfo rations, lids, jugs/amphoras, braziers, carinated cups), the miniature vessels constitute 10%-22% of the total, while in the second group (bridge-spouted jars, pithoid jars, pithoid vessels, dishes/ trays, vessels with plastic decoration, handleless conical cups, straight-sided cups, tripod cooking pots) they consti tute only 0.02%-7.35% of their respective shape populations.</page><page sequence="6">218 IPHIYENIA TOURNAVITOU</page><page sequence="7">MINIATURE POTTERY VESSELS 219 100% 90% 70% 60% 2 50% _ 40% ~" 20% ~ 10% 10% * *t -I .p 04 W (0 * .- t , -ee . y" . . a S;" -. 5 t . e3 - ""b :h 6a r r$z... . erizr"n)? +++ 00Ar? 9 " ue, A."n a" . +.g.u - .R .w: :'' ";'.,....w:?.'"W : ,, ~.w- .F *,~ ^"..1 ...r...r, .

The last two vessel types could also have been used as simple votives or even as containers for symbolic dedications of offer ings, edible or not. More specialized libational activities, as implied by the rhyta and the cup-rhyta, presumably occurring in conjunction with the two previous categories of vessels (pouring vessels and/or cups), rank third. The remaining vessel types should perhaps be considered as auxiliary to the pre viously mentioned activities, with the exception of braziers and vessels with perforations, which may represent different and exceptional practices. A simple comparison of the miniature class with the respective set of data from the entire corpus of ceramic material from the sanctuary attests to significant differences in the use and, perhaps to a certain extent, in the function of the two groups of material. The overall corpus of vessel shapes (Table 18.2) is dominated by the handleless conical cup, represented by an overwhelming 90.75%, while the second place is occupied by the tripod cooking pots (7.16%), which represent an insignificant category of vessels in the miniature corpus (0.19%). In addition, the remaining 25 vessel types comprise a meager 2.09% of the assemblage, none of them exceeding 0.94% of the total.

STRATI GRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE MINIATURE VESSELS The study of contexts at Ayios Yeoryios sto Vouno involves the strati graphical distribution of the extant vessel types in relation to the Primary Deposition Locations (PDLs) and in association with layers preserving traces of pyres or material derived from pyres. PDLs are fortunately well attested at the sanctuary, but evidence for pyres is much scantier and on occasion elusive, to say the least.25 24. The juglets, the semiglobular cups, and even more so the rhyta and the cup-rhyta are obviously demoted in the grand scheme of things in this set of data. 25. The identification of the 27 PDLs was made on the basis of a com bination of factors, such as the position of a deposit on the bedrock?especially in areas where the rock formation con stituted a suitable depositional locus (niches, hollows, or fissures)?and the overall synthesis of the deposit, i.e., the presence of intact vases and other associated votive objects, as well as the absence or a very low percentage of post-Minoan elements. Material not recorded in these locations or deposits</page><page sequence="9">MINIATURE POTTERY VESSELS 221 An analytical survey of the find contexts has revealed that a consid erable majority (66.18%) of the extant miniature vessels at the site was attested in PDLs,26 in direct contrast to the overall corpus of material, in which only 11.52% of the total finds occurred in PDLs.27 This fact suggests that although the absolute numbers of miniature vessels in the sanctuary were quite meager compared to the grand total of the extant material, the actual use of these miniatures was definitely specialized and more focused on symbolic dedication and/or ritual use in areas of primary deposition of material. Their corresponding significance in cult activities may thus be inferred. The vast majority of the miniature specimens (717 of 1,000 specimens, or 71.70%) were recorded at a single terrace, terrace 7, the lowest exca vated area and perhaps one of the most important locations in regards to ritual practices, as it had the greatest number of PDLs (Table 18.3). The remaining specimens were almost equally divided among three other areas, terrace 5 (9.80%), terrace 2 (8.80%), conveniently located at the top of the hill, and terrace 3 (7.40%).28 Of the 1,000 specimens in PDLs, only 8.6% were recorded in layers associated with pyres or associated material; these were all situated on terrace 2, at the top of the hill. On terrace 7, the terrace with the greatest concentration of PDLs, there were no traces of pyres or even material from pyres.29 On the whole, the total amount of miniature material at tested in layers associated with pyres or transported material from pyres, in primary deposition locations and other contexts, barely exceeds 7%, a fact that suggests that throwing miniatures?or nonminiatures for that matter?into pyres was not a popular ritual practice at the peak sanctuary of Ayios Yeoryios sto Vbuno.30 was not considered in situ, but rather the result of successive displacements and landslides, often due to post Minoan disturbance. The archaeological evidence for the existence of pyres or material from pyres at the sanctuary is extraordina rily poor. Only one instance of a possi ble pyre can be securely assigned to the Bronze Age. It was found on terrace 2, in the south part of the area between the two churches, located at the top of the hill, with minimal disturbance and traces of burning in patches. Even in this case though, none of the associated material (pottery, bronze idols, a bronze tool, clay objects) preserved traces of burning, and no animal bones or seashells were recorded. The content of the pottery assem blage, which was Neopalatial in date, is nevertheless very pertinent to the miniature corpus, as it includes juglets, two miniature rhyta, and small or min iature cups. The significance of the ceramic material in layers with re mains of material from pyres, however, is not really representative of activities in the Minoan period, mostly due to the very disturbed state of the layers involved, many of which were surface layers. Only four out of the 18 extant layers with traces of pyres or material thereof can be associated with PDLs. That and the scarcity or near absence of clear evidence for activities involving the use of fire in Minoan times rather devalues the connection between ritual pyres and PDLs or even with regular cult activities at the site. 26. The miniatures in PDLs num ber 1,000 of a total of 1,511 examples, or 985 of 1,484 (66.37%) of the recog nizable vessel types (minus the sherds of indeterminate shape). 27. Overall, 22,595 specimens out of 196,010 occurred in PDLs; these amount to 12.41% of the 182,059 ves sels of recognizable types. 28. The recorded percentages in two of the other terraces, terrace 4 and terrace 6, are by comparison truly insignificant (terrace 4: 1.8%, terrace 6: 0. 5%). The miniatures, both intact and fragmentary, represent a truly minus cule percentage of the ceramic material in the above locations. 29. Of the remaining specimens, 1. e., those not attested in PDLs, only 4.69% of the total (24 of 511 speci mens), were recorded in layers asso ciated with pyres or material thereof. Fourteen of 24 specimens, or 58.33%, were recorded in layers associated with material from pyres, while 10 of 24 specimens, or 41.66% of the material, were recorded in the single, purely Minoan layer with concrete traces of a pyre (terrace 2, layer 2; see n. 25). 30. Only 110 of 1,511 (7.27%) miniatures were found in such layers; of these, 86 specimens come from primary deposition locations and 24 from other layers.</page><page sequence="10">TABLE 18.3.

This probably illustrates the popularity of pouring for symbolic drinking/ offering ceremonies and/or libations. The 21 remaining miniature vessel types make up a mere 13.1% of the overall total. The corresponding data of the entire ceramic corpus from PDLs feature a wider range of shapes, different shape categories, and the presence of two preeminent vessel types: the handleless conical cup and the tripod cooking pot, representing 44.73% and 43.98% of the overall material, respectively (Table 18.4). As in the miniature corpus, these two vessel types constitute a staggering 88.71% of the extant ceramic material, whereas the remain ing 25 vessel types constitute only 11.29% of the material. Most shapes, including rhyta, cup-rhyta, and semiglobular cups, represent almost invisible minorities (0.004%-0.57%). Four out of the 27 extant PDLs (or 14.81%) contain no miniature vessels whatsoever (see Table 18.3). As regards shape frequencies, miniature juglets?in contrast to other vessel types whose frequency varies gready? represent the only shape attested in almost all PDLs (in 22 of 27, or 81.48%), coming closest to what we might call a standard type (Table 18.3). The next most common vessel type is the handleless conical cup, occurring in 17 out of 27 PDLs (62.96%). It was found in very modest quantities in nearly all PDLs, except on terrace 7, in an area including five PDLs.39 Both its frequency and its population ratio per location contrast with the data from the nonminiature corpus. All of the remaining vessel types occur in fewer than 45% of the extant PDLs, nine of them, rather irregularly, in fewer than 8% of the locations.40 In two locations, handleless conical cups, rhyta, and semiglobular cups are not attested at all.41 31. The frequencies of vessels with traces of burning in the entire ceramic corpus from the sanctuary are even lower: 290 of 196,010 (0.14%). These include juglets (6 of 1,021, or 0.58%), handleless conical cups (10 of 13,191, or 0.006%), dishes/trays (1 of 56, or 1.78%), bird's-nest bowls (1 of 2), braziers (2 of 42, or 4.76%), and tri pod cooking pots (270 of 13,034, or 2.07%). 32. Miniature juglets: 6 of 1,021 (0.58%); handleless conical cups: 1 of 291 (0.34%); dishes/trays: 1 of 3; bird's-nest bowls: 1 of 2. 33. Terrace 2, LM I layer; terrace 5, trench 1, layer 2. 34.

The only exception is pithoid jars, which do not feature in PDLs. 37.

The numbers appearing under each shape category and PDL in this table refer to the number of individual specimens attested. Although this was manageable for the majority of the shape categories, the masses of material associated with a small number of vessel types (handleless conical cups, straight-sided cups, tripod cooking pots, juglets) dictated a deviation from the normal presentation strategy. Therefore, the freestanding numbers in the category of the handleless conical cups represent the intact vessels, while those in parentheses represent the number of intact bases. The freestanding numbers in the category of the juglets also represent the intact vessels, while the numbers in parentheses represent the number of fragmentary specimens attested.

The standard shapes, occurring in all PDLs, include three vessel types: handleless conical cups, tripod cooking pots, and straight-sided cups; the last two types are almost nonexistent in the miniature class. The juglets are in second place, occurring in 22 out of 27 PDLs (or 81.48%), just ahead of bridge-spouted jars, found in 19 out of 27 PDLs (or 70.37%).42 As regards combinations of associated miniatures (Table 18.3), only a few PDLs (8 out of 27, or 29.62%) contain a notable variety of miniature vessel types (between 9 and 11). The rest (19 out of 27, or 70.37%) include combinations of seven different vessel types or fewer, the majority (10 out of 19, or 52.63%) include between 4 and 6 vessel types each. The 8 PDLs with the greatest variety of vessel types, containing a total of 9 to 11 different forms, always include miniature juglets, handleless conical cups, and rhyta, whereas jugs/amphoras and bridge-spouted jars occur in 7 out of the 8 locations (Table 18.3). These basic shapes coexist with multiple vessels, semiglobular cups and basins as well as cup-rhyta (in 6 out of 8 locations); pithoid vessels and footed semiglobular cups (in 5 out of 8 locations); straight-sided cups (2 out of 8 locations); the remaining vessel types are not attested in more than one location.43 In the 11 PDLs containing only basic combinations of one to five different vessel types, the only standard form is the juglet, followed by handleless conical cups (in 7 out of 11 locations), cup-rhyta (in 4 out of 11 locations), and the jugs/amphoras (in 3 out of 11 locations). When the juglet is accompanied by two or three other miniatures, they consist of open drinking vessels (handleless conical cups, semiglobular cups) and a closed vessel (jug/amphora, pithoid vessel). All the remaining combinations are elaborations of.this pattern (Table 18.3). In contrast to the data from the miniature class, the majority of the PDLs in the overall corpus (17 out of 27, or 62.96%) yielded combina tions of 10 to 21 different vessel types (Table 18.4).44 In PDLs with 3 to 5 different vessel types, the three standard shapes (handleless conical cups, tripod cooking pots, and straight-sided cups) are accompanied by juglets and isolated cases of braziers and kalathoi. In PDLs with an intermediate number of types, the three standard forms are attested alongside semiglobu lar cups, rhyta, bridge-spouted jars, vessels with plastic decoration, and isolated occurrences of cup-rhyta, jugs/amphoras, dishes/trays, and pithoi. Finally, in the PDLs with the largest variety of vessel types, the standard trio of drinking cups, tripod cooking pots, and miniature juglets seems to have been associated with a greater number of storage or pouring vessels45 and specialized libational46 or dedicatory specimens.47 42. Other significant groups include the semiglobular cups (occurring in 66.66% of the PDLs); jugs/ampho ras (in 59.25% of the PDLs); pithoid vessels (in 55.55% of the PDLs); and pithoi (in 51.85% of the PDLs). The remaining vessel types occur in less than 45% of the PDLs (Table 18.4). 43. The largest concentration of miniature vessels, a total of 437 minia tures, comprising 43.70% of the total miniatures in PDLs, was encountered in a single area of terrace 7 (grid 1, layer 2), which includes five different PDLs. 44. The higher range, including more than 11 vessel types, is not really paralleled in the miniature class. 45. Jugs/amphoras, bridge-spouted jars, pithoid vessels, and pithoi. 46.

It appears that the most popular and persistent activities in the overall corpus are not pouring and symbolic drinking and/or offering ceremonies, as was the case in the miniature corpus, but ritual drinking and/or symbolic dedication of offerings (cups), the consumption or offering of food (tripod cooking pots)?perhaps in conjunction with accessory vessels (kalathoi, dishes/trays, lids)?and finally pouring and/or symbolic dedication of liquid substances (juglets), in that order.48 The presence of rhyta and cup-rhyta only in PDLs with a medium or high number of vessel types is perhaps indicative of the relatively optional role of these ceramic forms in ritual practices more pertinent to the miniature class. The short-term storage/pouring vessels illustrate an as yet unknown parameter of primary depositional practices, perhaps related to drinking and the consumption of food. The small proportional representation of the miniature class in the overall ceramic material from the sanctuary does not attest to an intensive use of miniatures by the local population of worshipers. The extremely varied repertory of shapes reproduced in miniature form, on the other hand, even if its vast majority occurs in minuscule quantities, suggests that the practice of making and using miniatures was fairly commonplace but thinly spread across the board, and in most cases was not as specialized or directed as we would perhaps like it to be. The repertory of Prepalatial and Protopalatial specimens reflects simpler needs/practices at the miniature level, mostly involving symbolic drinking and/or offering, in contrast to the Neopalatial repertory, which is much more specialized and diversified. The resulting corpus, reflecting the nature and relative popularity of ac tivities performed with miniature vessels, does in fact fingerprint a number of rituals, such as pouring for symbolic drinking/offering ceremonies and/ or for libations, as well as straightforward dedication of vessels. The only miniature vessel type attested often enough and in large enough quantities to justify the title votive, even if its value was probably also based on its contents when full, is the miniature juglet (Fig. 18.3:a). The miniature handleless conical cups (Fig. 18.3:b), the vessel type second in popularity, appear not to have been as indispensable as one would expect considering the data from the nonminiature corpus. Local prefer ence as regards this otherwise ubiquitous form evidently leaned toward nonminiature versions, i.e., toward actual?as opposed to symbolic? activities, whatever these may have been.49 This suggests that either their symbolic, nonutilitarian aspect was undervalued, or that regular handleless 48. The presence of braziers in these contexts, although pertinent to the ritual aspect, cannot be directly con nected to burnt material. 49. Massive depositions of handle less conical cups inside buildings or in open-air contexts such as chasms or rock fissures, often in association with burnt layers and food remains, are one of the commonest features of peak sanctuaries in Crete, especially at Juktas (Karetsou 1976, pp. 234, 238; 1977, p. 334; 1980, pp. 223-238, 241,245 246, 249, 252; 1982, p. 340), but also at Atsipades (Peatfield 1992, pp. 68, 70; Morris and Peatfield 1995, pp. 644 645), Petsophas (Myres 1902-1903, p. 378; Rutkowski 1988, p. 86), Vry sinas (Davaras 1974, p. 210), Kophinas, and Spili Voritsi (Rutkowski 1988, pp. 83, 88). Nowhere are miniature specimens mentioned per se, except in the case of the Atsipades sanctuary, where it is clearly stated that no minia ture versions were attested (Peatfield 1992, p. 69; Morris and Peatfield 1995, p. 645).</page><page sequence="16">228 IPHIYENIA TOURNAVITOU conical cups were considered sufficiently symbolic. The term "disposable mass-produced vessels" does not seem to apply to the miniature version of the form. Although the assumption that miniature handleless conical cups were often used in conjunction with juglets and other miniature vessels is absolutely justified by their archaeological context, the association of both shapes with a much larger number of regular-sized vessels in PDL contexts suggests that this relationship was not exclusive.50 Finally, the rhyton class (Fig. 18.3:c, d), although represented by a relatively small number of specimens, constitutes a special case. The rhyta, which in this context belong to a class of specialized and/or ritual equipment,51 not expected to be used either as votives52 or as containers of substances, should for this reason be considered as over-represented.53 A further idiosyncracy is the unusually high percentage of miniature or small versions in the overall shape population of the rhyton class.54 Their overall presence, as well as their occurrence in 44.44% of extant PDLs, indicates a preference for the use of miniatures and therefore for symbolic action in libational activities at the site, presumably in conjunction with juglets and miniature cups. The minuscule quantities of the remaining miniatures, which consti tute the majority of the extant vessel types in the corpus, and include both closed and open vessels, suggest that they probably served in an accessorial capacity to the three main functional classes (juglets, handleless conical cups, rhyta), i.e., that their use was basically optional. It is conceivable that the extant nonminiature specimens in the corresponding categories were considered more pertinent and perhaps more necessary to the specific ritual practices involved. The statistics from the overall corpus once more confirm the striking differences in the use and/or manipulation of miniature and nonminia ture vessels, and that the ritual priorities at the sanctuary were associated with a set of basic activities (ritual drinking, dedication of offerings, and consumption of food) not related to miniatures. The high concentration 50. Clustering of miniatures is nowhere exclusive enough to justify such a conclusion. 51. Although the vast majority of the Bronze Age rhyta were in fact re corded in storage contexts, and despite the relative scarcity of corroborating iconographic evidence, their use as rit ual equipment in specific cult contexts is widely accepted (Boyd-Hawes et al. 1908, p. 40a; Bosanquet and Dawkins 1923, p. 22; Warren 1969, pp. 166-167; Koehl 1981; 1990, pp. 350-361; 2000; 2006, pp. 353?361; Vermeule and Karageorghis 1982, pp. 20-22; Rut kowski 1986, p. 85; Peatfield 1990, pp. 127-128; Sackett 1996, p. 54; Sakellarakis and Sapouna-Sakellaraki 1997, p. 588. Only Nilsson (1950, pp. 144-146) rejects the religious significance of human- and animal shaped rhyta. The analysis of the or ganic residue in a LH III rhyton from Midea suggests that this particular vessel at least was used in conjunction with wine and beer (Tzedakis and Martlew 1999, p. 171; Betancourt 2001, p. 147). 52. The fact that rhyta as a class, and especially miniature versions of this class, may be over-represented at the peak sanctuary is only a relative state ment, and it should not blind us to the fact that they represent a very small percentage of the miniature corpus (3.83%), let alone the overall corpus. Their infrequency, in conjunction with their form, suggests that their role as votives is rather unlikely. Their dimen sions do not render them dysfunctional, especially if used in conjunction with miniature juglets and cups. 53. Rhyta, let alone miniature spec imens, seem to be a rarity in peak sanctuaries. Small groups (one to five examples) of normal-sized specimens have been reported from the peak sanctuary at Atsipades (Peatfleld 1992, p. 68; Morris and Peatfleld 1995, pp. 645-646), Prinias (Rutkowski 1988, p. 87), Kophinas (Rutkowski 1988, p. 83), and Juktas (A. Karetsou, pers. comm.). None of these was apparently miniature. Miniature imitations of Minoan rhyta in a ritual context were only recorded at Avaris, in Egypt, mostly in tombs (Koehl 2000, p. 99). 54. Among the 55 rhyta found, 46 were miniature, 6 were small, and 3 were normal-sized specimens.</page><page sequence="17">MINIATURE POTTERY VESSELS 229 of miniature specimens in PDLs, in contrast to the spatial distribution of the overall ceramic corpus, could infer a more specialized use of miniatures in cult activities. Their association with ritual pyres or direct burning is unfortunately as elusive as that established for the entire ceramic material at the sanctuary. MINIATURE POTTERY IN MINOAN PEAK SANCTUARIES In the Aegean Bronze Age, miniatures, especially pottery and figurines, are mostly associated with ritual locations, and especially with peak sanctuar ies.55 Depositions of miniature votive vessels of various types, interpreted as intrinsic elements of the cult, have been reported from a significant number of peak sanctuaries in Crete, mostly in association with rock fissures and primary depositions.56The published specimens, in contrast to the variety encountered at Ayios Yeoryios sto Vouno, include mostly examples of jug lets,57 and isolated cases of multiple vessels,58 cups,59 amphoras,60 pithoi,61 and miniature tripod cooking pots.62 The presence of miniatures in ritual contexts constitutes an almost uni versal and, more importantly, a diachronic votive practice in the Aegean.63 On the level of symbolic values, their use illustrates a deliberate attempt at expressing ideas or gestures as opposed to carrying out practical functions. Miniatures, as a class, have been variously interpreted as toys, as burial of ferings, or as ritual objects, depending on context. The ritual aspect is often traced back to the association of miniatures with children and play.64 The published views on the meaning of the phenomenon of minia turization (i.e., of the scaling down of canonical, functional forms), espe cially among Aegean prehistorians, tend to reflect a rather materialistic perspective, in which miniatures are viewed as substitutes or tokens for the 55.

It is assumed that they were dedicated mostly for economic and/or practical reasons, i.e., their lower relative cost and transportability. A prime example of this is the dedica tion of miniature animal models instead of real animals for sacrifice; the same would apply to the dedication of miniature models of first fruits or foodstuffs.65 On a more conceptual level, in the "parts for the whole" theory,66 min iatures represent a more personal mode of dedication or communication with the deity involved,67 not a mere substitute. Finally, the association of miniatures with activities somehow related to children, either directly as dedicators or indirectly by virtue of their relationship to the deity involved, although pertinent to a wider chronological and geographical range,68 is rather doubtful in Bronze Age ritual contexts.69 In the Kythera peak sanctuary, the numbers of miniatures compared to the numbers of extant nonminiature specimens contradict their use as cheap, mass-produced alternatives to large vessels. The small numbers attested and the wide variety of vessel forms produced suggest that the most critical factor might have been personal choice. The scaling down of canonical pottery vessels, despite the concomitant loss of function, could also be perceived as a multiplier of the ideological properties of these ves sels, whatever these properties may have been.70 The detailed analysis of the data from the peak sanctuary at Kythera, if nothing else, has in fact confirmed, beyond reasonable doubt, that size did make a difference and was deliberately manipulated for specific ritual purposes. 65.

In the Aegean Bronze Age, miniatures in ritual contexts are mostly interpreted as votive offerings, while their use as toys is understandably under played, considering their scarcity in settlement contexts (Knappett, forth coming).
