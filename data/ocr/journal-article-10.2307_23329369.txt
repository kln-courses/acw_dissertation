<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Place of Aesthetics in Tagore's Thought Naravane It has been said of Kant that 'aesthetics represents the crown ing phase of his philosophy'. One is tempted to make a similar remark about Rabindranath Tagore, in whose aesthetic opinions the fundamental ideas underlying his metaphysical and ethical views seem to find their ultimate fulfilment. And yet the analogy between Tagore and Kant is only par tially valid. In the case of Tagore, Aesthetics cannot be des cribed as a phase' of his thought, not even the final phase. Kant definitely built up his philosophy in accordance with a clearly marked out pattern. In the first Critique he analysed the world of natural necessity, and discussed the role of the Understand ing with respect to this world. In the Second Critique, he analysed the world of Freedom. And in the third, the Critique of Judgment, he sought to establish the harmony between the two realms of Necessity and Freedom. Thus his aesthetics was conceived so as to fulfil a particular purpose at a particular stage in the evolution of his thought. But a study of Tagore's works reveals a radically different situation. We find that, far from introducing aesthetics into his world-view in order to complete or systematise his ideas, Tagore allows his deepest thoughts on metaphysical and ethical questions to be soaked and permeated by his aesthetic approach, and even his specific aesthetic opinions. Aesthetics is thus the very foundation of his philosophy, not its -coping stone. Very often the failure to recognise this fact leads to an in ability to understand Tagore's philosophical and religious ideas. These ideas are treated in isolation from their general aesthetic framework, and their underlying unity is missed. The result is that Tagore's philosophy is mechanically categorised into 'sec tions' or 'stages', and this in its tum leads to all kinds of dichotomies—Upanishadic versus Vaishnava, rational versus intuitional, theistic versus pantheistic, and so on. Clearly, this procedura can only culminate in two alternatives: either we attribute to Tagore a particular theory or set of theories with the help of forced and far-fetched interpretations, or we be little his philosophical achievement in one way or another.</page><page sequence="2">AESTHETICS IN TAGORES THOUGHT 147 It would be easy to mention scores of books and articles on Tagore in which these two unfortunate attitudes are reflected. In some of these writings, we find attempts to 'prove' that Tagore was a Hegelian, an Emergent Evolutionist, an Advaitist, or a follower of the 'Achintya-bhedabheda' school. On the other hand we are often told that Tagore's philosophising need not be talcen seriously, that he was merely 'embroidering the mar gins of truth' in moments of playfulness. This one-sidedness, let me repeat, is the inevitable result of overlooking the foundational position which Aesthetics occupies in Tagore's thought. Once we grasp the basic fact that Aesthe tics is the dough with which his metaphysical and ethical cakes are baked, we are able to understand not only Tagore's total world-view but also his views on specific philosophical prob lems. Let me take up a few examples. I should like to begin by referring to Tagore's views on a problem that has recurred again and again in traditional Indian thought—the problem of Maya. Absolute Monism rejects the reality of the phenomenal world. According to it, both God and the World cannot be real. The world only seems to be, its existence is a mere appearance. This appearance is the result of Maya, which thus becomes the principle of cosmic illusion. In refuting this position, theistic philosophers have advanced many academic arguments: How can a source of error be con ceived when God is the sole source of everything? Where can Maya have its 'location? How can it conceal or obscure Reality and produce illusion unless it is more powerful than God Him self? Tagore was thoroughly familiar with all these arguments, as his discourses collected in the two volumes entitled Santi niketan show. But he does not seem to have attached much weight to them. His views on the question of Maya are refresh ingly different. The world, says Tagore, is indeed Maya in the sense that it is an 'appearance'. But is appearance altogether opposed to reality? Is illusion necessarily devoid of truth? On the contrary, "when we deprive truth of its appearance, it loses the best part of its reality; for appearance is a personal relationship, it is for</page><page sequence="3">148 INDIAN literatuke: vol. 4, 1961 me." Elusiveness is not outside the pale of reality. The word Maya merely indicates the fleeting and inconstant nature of things, and as such it conveys a highly suggestive idea. "The dream persists, it is real.... The painted canvas is durable and substantial,, the picture is a dream, it is 'maya'. Yet it is the picture and not the canvas which has the meaning of ultimate reality." This emphasis on personal relationship, this acceptance of illusion itself as a part of reality, reveals a typically aesthetic approach. To the metaphysician, the world is either apparent or real; to the artist, it is apparent and therefore real. And so Tagore can turn to the pluralist and say: 'Of course the world is real. You are perfectly right in insisting upon this.' But he can also make friends with the monist, after taking the sting out of may avada. He can say: 'Of course the world is an appear ance. But, my dear fellow, what is wrong about that?" To quote his own words: "The world as an art is 'Maya'. It 'is' and 'is not'. Its sole explanation is that it seems to be what it is. The ingre dients are elusive. Call them maya', disbelieve them as you will, the Great Artist, the Mayavin, is not hurt." I now turn to another aspect of Tagore's thought which shows the pervasive influence of his aesthetic evaluation of fundamental philosophical problems. Tagore has been described as a 'humanist'. Even those exponents of Tagore's writings who differ very widely from each other on several important questions somehow seem to agree in describing the poet as a great humanist. But in what sense is he a humanist? When we look a little deeper into the implications of this epithet we find a rather chaotic state of affairs. Tagore's humanism, we discover, means different things to different people. To some, he is a humanist because he is a friend of the under-dog; to others because he denounces fascism and champions individual freedom; to yet others be cause he speaks of God in terms of man and of humanity in terms of divinity. Such an overlapping of concepts can scarcely satisfy a serious student of Tagore's thought. The validity of all the descriptions</page><page sequence="4">AESTHETICS IN TAGORe'S THOUGHT 149 listed above may be conceded; but they do not tell us in what way Tagore's humanism is distinctively his own, nor do they point to the pivotal idea around which his humanistic philosophy is developed. For this we have to turn, once again, to his aesthetic view oí life. &gt;, Tagore's humanism can be considered in the context of two questions: Man's relationship with Nature, and Man's relation ship with Ultimate Reality. On both these questions his own viewpoint can best be understood in the light of the aesthetic foundation of his thought. The "kinship' between man and nature is one of the dominant ideas not only in Tagore's philosophical writings but also in his poetry and drama. This intimate communion between man and nature is explained on the basis of the mutual need' of the two realms. On the one hand, man has to respond to the call of the green' (sabujer nimantran) in order to realise the truth of his own existence. Human experience cannot be taken "as an excrescence upon the universe, with no root in the nature of things". On the other hand, nature by itself is also 'incomplete'. Without man, nature would be like a broken arch, a circle un closed. "The earth and the sky are woven with the fibres of man's mind." But to relate man with nature is not to equate them. Nature and Spirit are both real; but the absolute superiority of the latter over the former is unquestioned. And this is just where we come to the question of humanism. Unlike the naturalist or the gross materialist, Tagore refuses to reduce the human to the level of the natural; he awards to mankind the highest place in the cosmos. "The revealment of the Infinite is to be seen most fully not in the starry heavens but in the soul of man." But in what does man's uniqueness consist? It consists in the fact that he alone is an artist. It is his faculty of aesthetic ex perience, and aesthetic communication, that exalts man over the rest of the Universe. Tagore expressed this idea in various ways; he draws attention to a number of facets of man's un rivalled position. In the first place, while the reigning princi ple of nature is Determinism, that of human life is Freedom; and the highest form which Freedom takes is that of artistic</page><page sequence="5">150 INDIAN LITERATURE: VOL. 4, 1961 endeavour. Secondly, man dares to scorn the demands of utility. He is guided by the Angel of Surplus. His energy overflows into channels that have nothing to do with biological survival. He wants the immense, the glorious, the magnificent. Thirdly, this very discontent makes man eternally restless. He is ever on the move, seeking new avenues of self-expression. His cry is: "Not here! Not here! I long for another dwelling somewhere far-away." This freedom, this thirst for a greatness that is biologically superfluous, this divine discontent, is the prerogative of the artist. Man, the artist, "is not a casual visitor but a special guest in the universe." With his arrival, a new stage opens out in the history of Life. "The receptive phase is left behind. Man enters the career of creative life." In the external world, mere efficiency no longer satisfies him. He craves for Beauty. In the inner world of the mind, too, knowledge based upon cere bral associations is not enough for him. He seeks beauty through ideas and imagination. In short, man's superiority over the rest of nature, though it is expressed in many different ways, is most fully and strikingly revealed in the aesthetic side of his life. I believe no thinker of our age has emphasised this fact more forcefully than Rabindranath Tagore has done. And if I had been a little less suspicious of philosophical labels', I would have suggested that Tagore's humanism may be termed as 'Aesthetic Humanism', Let me now turn to the other aspect of Humanism. Tágore does not stop short with exalting humanity in comparison with the rest of the Universe; he defines Ultimate Reality itself in terms of human experience. God is no longer transcendent, and man is no longer an insignificant creature whose sole hope of salvation lies in utter submission to the Divine Will. On the contrary, God and Man become comrades, one might even say partners, in running the universe. But on what ground does Tagore adopt this humanistic posi tion? Why does he insist that "humanity is a necessary factor in the perfecting of divine truth"? Why does he, in poem after poem and play after play, dwell upon the close companionship</page><page sequence="6">AESTHETICS IN TAGOBE S THOUGHT 151 between the Infinite and the finite? The answer is that Tagore sees something in common between humanity and divinity; and this 'something' can only be understood in terms of art and beauty. God and man find themselves "in tune with each other" because they are both artists! Like Plotinus and Al-Ghazzali, Tagore regards the universe as a work of art. To convey this idea, he draws his metaphors from music, poetry, painting and even from dance. He describes God as the "master-musician whose melody pervades the uni verse"; as the Cosmic Dancer—the Nataraja—at whose gestures worlds arise and dissolve; as a painter of incomparable skill who adorns heaven and earth with myriad hues. "The world as an art-work," he says, "is the play of the Supreme Person revelling in image-making." He quotes from the Upanishads: 'Behold the poem of God. It neither dies nor grows old' (Devasya pashya kävya, na mamära na jiryati). He quotes from the Git a: 1 am the splendour of splendid things.' 'Whatsoever is beauti ful goes forth from a fragment of my own splendour!' Ultimate Reality is thus regarded as the supreme source of Beauty no less than Truth. And what is the position of man in relation to God the Artist? Tagore assigns to humanity a variety of roles: sometimes, he speaks of man as the finest art-work of God; sometimes, man is regarded as the instrument of God's aesthetic activity. In every art-process an 'audience' is a neces sary supplement of the creator; and Tagore sometimes assigns to humanity the part of the appreciative audience of God's universal melody. But the pinnacle of humanism is reached when man is declared to be a co-artist, a fellow-creator, whose experience and endeavour are indispensable for the total rhythm of creation. At this point I should like to give a few citations from Tagore's writings. In an essay he describes humanity as "a divine harp of many strings waiting for its one grand music." In another context he writes: "God has many strings to his sitar; some are made of iron, yet others of copper; but man is the golden string of God's instrument." This reminds us of Schelling's statement that beauty is "the supreme expression of Divine Reality utter ing itself through man." Humanity thus becomes the highest medium through which</page><page sequence="7">152 INDIAN literature: vol. 4, 1961 God expresses his creative joy; the eye with which He beholds Himself and knows Himself to be the Principle of Beauty. Btit Tagore does not stop here. He glorifies man still further. "Our creations," he says, "are variations upon God's great theme of the Universe. Our freedom as creators finds its joy in contribu ting its own voice to the universal concert!" That is why God cannot ignore mankind. 'To all other things you give. From me you ask." And again: "In art the person in us is sending its answers to the Supreme Person who reveals himself to us across the lightless world of mere facts." Man thus responds to God's message of beauty in a spirit of confident equality, aware that God needs him for his own creative self-expression. This gives man the strength to say to God: You buy from the store of human eyes The light you need for your own sunrise! And again: In my world shall be fulfilled Your own highest power and privilege. (Amar bhuvane tabe Puma habe Tomar chararn adhikar.) What is this "highest privilege", this charam adhikar? It is the power of creative expression. In other words, it is God the Artist who finds his final fulfilment in mankind. In the light of this, the famous poem from Balaka entitled "Tumi-Ami" ceases to be a mystery. "I came, and you woke up. I came, and your heart was stirred." Why should the arrival of man make any difference to God? Nothing is added to his power, or even to his "thinking about thought", if we accept the Aristotelian con ception of God. When the poet says: "I came, and your sleep was broken" (Ami elem bhanglo tomar ghum), what he means is that with the emergence of humanity the artist in God is aroused, his aesthetic emotion is deepened, his creative facul ties are redoubled. All this may sound very anthropomorphic, but after all we are dealing with the philosophy of a poet, not of a svstem building metaphysician. There are bound to be variations and intermingling shades of meaning in the writings of such a</page><page sequence="8">AESTHETICS IN TAGOBES THOUGHT 153 tliinker. But the central fact remains—the humanism of Tagcre ■: has a distinctive quality of its own just because of his basically aesthetic approach. His views have often been compared with those of European humanists like Montaigne, Comte and others, as also with those of medieval Indian humanists like Kabir and Chandidas. The comparison is justified in many ways; and yet nowhere do we find such an impassioned attempt to raise huma nity to the level of Ultimate Reality in terms of aesthetic expe rience. In this respect Tagore is unique among humanists of all ages. That the poet himself was aware of this distinguishing fea ture of his philosophy can be seen from a number of passages in Religion of Man and other philosophical works. I shall, however, cite only a few sentences from Creative Unity where Tagore clearly distinguishes his own point of view from that of traditional religion or philosophy. He describes his own world view as a "Poet's religion"; but it might just as well be called a "Poet's philosophy". It makes no difference to our present argument that Tagore himself uses the word "religion". While referring to the deepest problems of life and existence, he never sharply demarcates religion from philosophy. Nor do the tradi tions of Indian thought demand such a demarcation. "My religion," says Tagore, "is essentially a poet's religion. Its touch comes to me through the same unseen and trackless channels as does the inspiration of my music." How does this religion differ from what he calls "dogmatic religion"? Tagore's answer is: "In dogmatic religion all questions are definitely answered and all doubts finally laid to rest. But the poet's reli gion is fluid, like the atmosphere round the earth where lights and shadows play hide-and-seek, and the wind like a shepherd boy plays upon its reeds among flocks of clouds. It never undertakes to lead anybody to a solid conclusion; yet it reveals endless spheres of light, because it has no walls round itself." Tagore is aware of the fact that such a philosophy will not satisfy the academic mind. "Those who are habituated to the rigid framework of sectarian creeds," he says, "will find such a religion too elastic and indefinite. No doubt it is so, but only</page><page sequence="9">154 INDIAN LITERATURE: VOL. 4, 1961 because its ambition is not to shackle the Infinite.. .but rather to help our consciousness emancipate itself. It is as inde finite as the morning, and yet as luminous; it calls our thoughts, feelings and actions into freedom, and feeds them with light." In these sentences we have the essence of all that is charac teristic in Tagore's world-outlook. The finest qualities of his thought are revealed here—sense of freedom, tolerance, sugges tiveness, resilience, and the possibilities of rich, fruitful develop ment which it opens out. Firmly taking his stand on the imme diacy and dynamism of aesthetic experience, Tagore leads us through ever-widening spheres of comprehension to a vision of the world in which harmony prevails over discord and diver gence. And I am convinced that if only this fundamentally aesthetic nature of his philosophy is clearly kept in view, the student of Tagore will be saved from a good deal of unnecessary specula tion, as well as from "theories" which do violence to the depth and sweep of Tagcre's philosophical utterances. k/UA $Ce. .</page></plain_text>
