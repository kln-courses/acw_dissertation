<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMMENT The origins of anthropomorphic thinking Steven Mithen and Pascal Boyer (1. Roy. anthrop. Inst. (N.S.) 2, 717-21) disagree over the natural- ness ofanthropomorphic thinking. According to Mithen, anatomically modern humans, unlike archaics such as the Neanderthals, display 'cog- nitive fluidity', such that the specialized neural circuitry for 'understanding of the natural world' draws spontaneously on the 'social intel- ligence' module and vice versa. One result is that hunter-gathers intuitively attribute 'theory of mind' to animals, empathizingwith hunted spe- cies as if they were human kin - the essence of 'totemism'. For Mithen, then, it is cognitively intuitive or 'natural' for Homo sapiens sapiens to generate and transmit therianthropic representations - as ex- emplified in the early Aurignacian ivory statuette of a man's body with a lion's head from Hoh- lenstein-Stadel in southern Germany. This no- tion of naturalness is unacceptable to Boyer, who has invested much theoretical labour in establishing the reverse position. Referring to human/animal composites and comparable 'cul- tural representations which violate intuitive principles', Boyer writes: 'These are not part of evolved intuitive ontology but quite the oppo- site' (p. 720). It is precisely the counter-intuitive, surprising and hence attention-grabbing nature of therianthropes and other inhabitants of the spiritual domain - their systematic violation of natural cognitive expectations - which in Boy- er's view accounts for their impact, memorabil- ity and hence success in cultural transmission. Boyer considers it 'misleading' to lump together the generation and transmission ofsophisticated cultural representations of this kind with the spontaneous tendency ofveryyoung children to expect animals to behave like humans, motivat- ed by similar (human-like) goals, beliefs and desires. 'These expectations', Boyer writes, 'ap- pear early in cognitive development; they are delivered equally automatically on the basis of similar cues for animals and humans. So it would be contrived to assume that they require a "transfer" of human properties onto animals' (p. 720). Boyer is surely right here. The thought of a child displays 'animism' at an early stage, before the flowering of language or a developed sense of self. It in no way depends on reflexivity or 'cognitive fluidity'. Mithen's attempt to reduce 'totenmism' to childlike animistic thought in fact recalls a nineteenth-century tradition in evolu- tionary anthropology better left to gather dust. Unfortunately, Boyer himself is scarcely more convincing in providing an explanation for the existence in the first place of what he terms 'counterintuitive cultural representations' such as gods or spirits capable of seeing everything at once. Boyer simply assumes that such represen- tations exist. But why? Given their plausibility, why are they not resisted, ignored or dismissed? Boyer chooses not to address what for Darwin- ians is surely the central evolutionary question: what were the fitness benefits to evolving mod- em humans of their fascination with representa- tions of this kind? Darwinian psychologists (e.g. Baron-Cohen 1995) have documented the centrality of 'pre- tend play' to normal human mind-reading com- petence and reflexivity. When a child pretends that a pencil, say, is an aeroplane, experiencing this pretence as a fiction in which others col- lude, it is enabled to view the fiction - insepara- ble from its own thought - as if from the out- side. Identification with others in respect of the pretend-play representation allows the child to construct a further representation of its owns self as a distinct subject. In the absence of social pretend-play, this cognitive breakthrough is nev- er made. Rather, the subject remains 'inside' its own thoughts, unable to view itself as a subjec- tive agency distinct from them. The child then knows, but does not know that it knows. Only in 'knowing that we know' can each one of us construct the self as a subject independent of our thoughts - integrating the mind's various outputs and displaying in the process 'cognitive fluidity'. It is noticeable that Mithen nowhere address- es the evolutionary function of 'communal pretend-play' or 'ritual'. In his book (Mithen 1996), there is an index entry under 'religion', but none under 'ritual'. The omission is per- plexing because, as Boyer (1994) points out, and as social anthropologists since Durkheim have known, the ritual domain is intimately bound up with those 'counterintuitive' representations which are so central to religious cosmology. It</page><page sequence="2">130 COMMENT seems important to stress, however, that contra- ry to Boyer, 'the gods' do not just appear and then replicate themselves autonomously through being 'attention-grabbing'. Rather, the immor- tals need organized communal help. Humans in fact incur substantial energetic costs in perform- ing elaborate rituals designed specifically to sus- tain such hallucinatory representations. There is little to be said for Boyer's (1996: 94) assertion that 'religious ontologies need very little actual transmission in order to be reproduced from generation to generation'. The evidence rather is that humans would not believe in improbable entities such as unicorns, rainbow snakes, the- rianthropes or other magico-religious fictions without loud, costly, ritualistic and even trau- matic signals, often central to initiatory ordeals, designed precisely to overcome listener-resist- ance and ensure transmission. The record of African rock art provides a the- rianthrope of comparable age to the Hohlen- stein-Stadel lion-man and the anthropomorphic bison of Chauvet cave - a 26,000-year-old feline with human legs from Apollo 11, Namibia (Wendt 1976). Lewis-Williams (1984) has argued that this figure could indicate traditions of ritual trance dance reaching back into the Pleistocene. Rock art studies in southern Africa and beyond have been revolutionized by the hypothesis that the images represent trance or 'spirit world' ex- perience, not perceptible reality (Garlake 1995: Lewis-Williams 1981). In particular, graphic de- pictions of humans metamorphosing into ani- mals - dying eland, 'flying bucks', underwater creatures - appear to be fundamental metaphors for experiencing trance 'death' and entering states of 'potency'. A Darwinian searching for the ultimate evolu- tionary cause of these behaviours must take into account the costs. Trance-inducing rituals are high-cost activities: even those who do not dance engage in energetically costly night-long singing and clapping, while trancers themselves - who spend years in acquiring their skills - face considerable stress and pain in entering al- tered states ofconsciousness. Around these ritu- als are woven elaborate ideologies, narratives of visits to the spirit world, besides also the pro- duction of rock art - decidedly a costly signal- ling activity. Mithen's notion that the adaptive value of all this is to be understood in terms of better hunt- ing techniques and efficiency is unconvincing. In the case of the Kalahari Bushmen, one of the most appropriate occasions for trance perform- ance occurred aJfer a successful hunt - when 'community healing' would alleviate the ten- sions surrounding distribution of a large-scale kill. Just how the mental and physical exhaus- tion of undergoing trance through one night, into the following day and then into the next night (Barnard 1992: 58) could improve male huntingperformance is difficult to understand. The other ancient Bushman ritual involving anthropomorphic metaphor is the menarcheal rite, often called the Eland Bull dance. Trance potency and menstrual potency in Bushman conception were readily conflated through par- allel symbolism involving blood, sweat, smell, identification with the game, and shooting or being shot by poisoned arrows (cf. Huffman 1983; Katz 1982: 172). We would ask Mithen: how does placing a menarcheal girl in a hut on starvation rations and dancing around her in a communal pretence ofbeing elands matingwith an eland bull improve a hunter's understanding of eland behavioural ecology? In this case as in so many others, the Bush- men themselves make clear what is going on. At the culmination of the five-day long seclusion and emergence of the menarcheal girl 'everyone will be hot (eager) for eating and the men will want to go hunting' (Lewis-Williams 1981: 51). In Darwinian terms, this makes good sense. The whole energy-expensive ritual has focused attention on the fact that the girl is imminently fertile, imminently sexually available, and there- fore highly attractive to males who should be motivated to hunt and bring game in brideserv- ice. Mithen's picture is of anatomically modem human males becoming endowed with margin- ally increased productivity thanks to some fortu- itous cognitive re-wiring. But his attempt to ex- plain hunter-gatherer religion as a direct cogni- tive contribution to male hunting efficiency will convince few social anthropologists familiar with the details. The choice is not between such mentalist techno-economic functionalism and a picture of Homo sapiens sapiens lost in 'profound metaphysical problems about the human condi- tion' (Mithen 1996: 169). It is time to abandon the tired 'Man the Hunter' paradigm and in- stead seek adaptive explanations in terms of so- cial and political solutions to problems of social distribution and exchange (cf. Erdal &amp; Whiten 1994). Symbolic systems need not be seen as 'metaphysics'; they are best viewed as collective cognitive maps defining through metaphor the 'other-worldly' forces governing the distribution of resources crucial to reproductive success - primarily food and sexual partners. Adopting this point of departure, we can generate a Dar- winian model of the evolutionary emergence of human symbolic culture and cognition which does justice to the complexity of the ethno- graphic, rock-art and other symbolic data. If such a model can also explain the emergence of 'reflexivity', 'cognitive fluidity' and 'metaphori- cal thinking', so much the better. As encephalization proceeded and accelerated among late archaic Homo sapiens from 250,000 BP onwards, females came under unprecedent- ed reproductive stress owing to the high ener- getic cost of producing larger-brained infants (PRwer &amp; Aiello 1997). Pregnant and nursing females would have needed regular supplies of high protein and fatty foods. Their major prob-</page><page sequence="3">COMMENT 131 lem would have been in preventing would-be dominant or philanderer males from channel- ling valuable high-energy food to cycling fe- males at the expense of pregnant/nursing fe- males. The logical solution would be for the pregnant/nursing females to resist such philan- dering strategies by bonding closely with men- struants, preventing their 'privatization' by phi- landerer males. Females would be expected to gather around anyone who had begun to men- struate, keeping dominant males away from her, drawingwhere necessary on the support of male kin, refusing sex to all outgroup males except those prepared to supply meat to the coalition as a whole. How would we expect such female coalitions to signal 'no sex'? The most unmistakable way would be to reverse the normal 'yes'-signals. Instead of signalling to prospective male part- ners 'I am of the same species as you, of the opposite sex and this is my fertile time' - the parameter settings central to normal 'courtship ritual' - females 'on strike' should systematically reverse all this, indicating 'wrong species/wrong sex/wrong time (Knight et al. 1995). Khoisan women staging an 'Eland Bull Dance' are doing precisely that. According to this model, then, communal pretend-play arises as a female-driven strategy for motivating male hunting. Maximum male effort is secured by advertising the imminent fer- tility of cycling females, while on the other hand signalling non-availability in the short term. As well as predicting the emergence of metaphori- cal pretend-play or 'ritual', and hence the corre- sponding forms of reflexivity, the model parsi- moniously accounts for a constellation of fea- tures including pre-hunt ritual celibacy, menstrual taboos ('wrong time'), 'anthropomor- phism' ('wrong species') and that gender ambi- guity ('wrong sex') which is so pervasive in the signature of 'ritual potency' worldwide.

Aft archaeol. Bull. 31, 5- 11. Chris Knight and Camilla Power claim that Pas- cal Boyer and myself disagree with regard to the naturalness of anthropomorphic thinking. They are mistaken. I believe that anthropomorphic thinking is a very recent development in human cognitive evolution, arising 100,000 years ago at the earliest and most probably restricted to H. sapiens sapiens alone. It does not have a deep evolutionary basis in the mind in the same man- ner as does thought about social relationships, physical objects or the natural world. Anthropo- morphic thinking is dependent upon the inte- gration of knowledge and ways of thinking from these cognitive domains, or what Boyer would refer to as intuitive ontologies. As such, it is an 'unnatural' way of thinking with no evolution- ary basis in the mind. I regard all types of thoughts which are products of 'cognitive fluid- ity' as unnatural. Knight and Power might be forgiven for this 'mistake' as it obviously hinges around how 'naturalness' is defined, which nei- ther they, myself nor Boyer have attempted to do in a serious manner. But I find it more diffi- cult to forgive their misrepresentation of my views regarding the evolution of totemic and religious thought. To claim that I 'attempt to reduce "totemism" to childlike animistic thought' is quite ridicu- lous. Both totemic thought and childlike ani- mistic thought share a belief in the continuity of</page><page sequence="4">132 COMMENT the human and non-human world, although the nature of this continuity may be significantly dif- ferent. At no place in the Prehistory ofthe mind, or in my other writings have I suggested that one can be reduced to the other. Both are simply a product ofthe cognitively fluid minds that mod- ern humans possess. Children may indeed dis- play animism at a stage before they acquire lan- guage. I suspect that a major reason for this is that from birth they are surrounded by material artefacts that are intentionally designed to create cognitive fluidity (i.e. to 'confuse'), such as plas- tic dolls that have human-like faces designed to activate mental modules relating to social intelli- gence, especially those concerning the theory of mind. In effect, even before children create cog- nitive fluidity for themselves by the use of lan- guage, we draw them into this with the material world we create for them, and indeed the man- ner in which we behave for them ('would you like to feed teddy, darling!'). Knight and Power describe ritual as including stress, pain and elaborate ideologies - emotion- ally and energetically high-cost activity. They claim that I believe 'the adaptive value of all this is to be understood in terms of better hunting techniques and efficiency'. This is a complete travesty of my views. As has been widely recog- nized, anthropomorphic thinking does appear to be an effective means for predicting animal behaviour, and hunter-gatherers who had this ability may have gained greater foraging efficien- cy than those who did not. This may have been one of the selective benefits that brought cogni- tive fluidity into existence; but it would have been just one among many. Yet once present, cognitive fluidity may lead to all types of behav- iour that have no functional value at all - such as many aspects of religious thought and behav- iour. To claim that I have attempted to 'explain hunter-gatherer religion as a direct cognitive contribution to male hunting efficiency' is a quite appalling misrepresentation of my ideas. As regards the 'omission' of any discussion of 'ritual' in the Prehistory of the mind, I think that Knight and Power should relax somewhat and not feel so perplexed (I'm a little perplexed as most people criticize my book for trying to cov- er too many things rather than not enough). I am sure that Knight and Power are absolutely right that the ritual domain is intimately bound up with the counter-intuitive representations which are so central to religious cosmologies. In a recent paper (Mithen in press) I have ad- dressed precisely this in light of my ideas about the prehistory of the mind. Very briefly to sum- marize, it seems to me that because religious ideas are unnatural (in terms of being a product of cognitive fluidity rather than havingan evolu- tionary basis in the mind) they are difficult to transmit. 'Whereas it is easy for us to share ideas about human social relationships (because we share a social intelligence with a deep evolu- tionary basis) it is immensely difficult for us to share ideas about religious entities. Ritual ena- bles the sharing of religious ideas by imprinting these into minds often by rote repetition, by stress and by pain. Such imprinting is not neces- sary for sharing ideas that relate to what Boyer would call an intuitive ontology or I would refer to as an evolved cognitive domain. Without such ritual the existence of religious institutions (i.e. a body of shared religious ideas) would be impossible. Another means by which religious ideas are shared is by using material images, such as carvings of half human/half animal fig- ures, the costumes people wear or symbolic images such as the crucifix. These images serve to anchor religious ideas into a mind in which they have no natural home. As regards the 'adaptive value' of sharing religious ideas and how we explain the costs involved in doing this, I suspect that for the majority of people for the majority of time there is no value at all - it is just an expensive activity that they would be better off without. But dominant individuals (often males) within societies maintain their own pow- er bases by manipulating the minds of other dis- advantaged individuals by promulgating beliefs in religious ideologies.
