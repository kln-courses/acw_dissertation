Bland with the assistance of Anna Gokhman Edited by William Workman and Karen Workman Abstract. This paper describes the development of early maritime adaptations in four regions of Northeast Asia during the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene transition. These include the Primor'e, the Lower Amur River basin, the northwest coast of the Sea of Okhotsk and adjacent Kamchatka, and the Bering Strait drainage. Fishing, especially for salmon, is thought to have been the earliest type of maritime adaptation in Northeast Asia, although fish remains are often missing from ancient sites due to poor preserva- tion. Ethnographic comparisons of fishing economies and settlement patterns are useful in reconstructing the importance of coastal and riverine fishing in the past. Several large adaptive zones existed on the Pacific coast of Northeast Asia during the early Holocene: (1) the region of Primor'e, including Sakhalin, with the shelf zone of the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk; (2) the lower Amur basin; (3) the northwest coast of the Sea of Okhotsk and the coastal regions of Kamchatka; and (4) the drainage system around Bering Strait (Fig. 1). Each zone has distinctive natural resources, climate, and ecologi- cal conditions, which began to take shape by the end of the Pleistocene. Archaeological materials indicate that human adaptation to the coastal regions of Northeast Asia was especially intensive during the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene transition. At this time a fundamental climatic shift occurred throughout the northern Pacific basin, from Hokkaido and Sakhalin to Kamchatka and Alaska. Palynological data and radiocarbon dates confirm that these cli- matic changes were simultaneous over the whole region at about 10,300 BP (Khotinskii 1977), and caused significant restructuring of the natural en- vironment and ecology. Paleolithic hunters were forced to migrate or to adapt to new conditions, exploiting more varied resources than were for- merly available. The use of varied resources is thought to have stimulated technological changes. In the south of the Russian Far East, for example, the subprismatic microblade technique was devel- oped, based on wedge-shaped cores, and accom- panied by diagonal burin production and bifacial working of stone tools (Vasirevskii and Gladyshev 1989). Different modifications of the microblade technique also took place on the Amur (Osipov culture sites) (Derevianko 1983) and in Kamchatka (Ushki sites) (Dikov 1979).

Primary ecological zones (I-IV) of coastal Northeast Asia as described in this paper. (rich ecological niches, availability of raw material resources for tool production, the perfecting of technique) were the prerequisites for the develop- ment of economic specialization and sedentism in the coastal zones and in the river valleys of North- east Asia. On the Asiatic coast of the North Pacific, the earliest type of maritime adaptation, as at- tested by archaeological materials, was the ex- ploitation offish runs, especially salmon. The transition to new food resources was caused by an abrupt increase in the quantity of spawning salmon. Nature rather quickly and rigorously de- termined this new type of economy. Its effective- ness and stability during the Late Pleistocene- Early Holocene transition are noted in Primor'e (the Ustinovka culture), on the Lower Amur (Osipov culture), and in Kamchatka (Ushki cul- ture). Thus, in the ZerkaFnaia River basin in Pri- mor'e, which flows into the Sea of Japan at about 45° North latitude, 22 sites were discovered and are assigned to the period 12,000-10,000 BP (Fig. 2). The stone inventory excavated at Ustinovka I and IV and Suvorovo III and IV is characterized by wedge-shaped and subprismatic cores, long blades, microblades, end and side scrapers, unifa- cial points, knives, transverse burins, punches, and spokeshaves (Figs. 3-4). Bifaces were found in the upper layer of the Ustinovka I site and at the Suvorovo III and IV sites (Vasil'evskii and Glady- shev 1989). No faunal remains were recovered in the sites because of poor preservation conditions in the Primor'e region. However, the topography of the sites, their position on the banks of the river along which salmon pass during spawning, and the proximity to the sea indicate that the chief occupation of the population of these sites was salmon fishing. This is attested as well by the as- sortment of stone tools. Use-wear analysis of the stone inventory of the Suvorovo IV site established that the majority of the tools were used for wood- working (chopping tools, planing knives, side scraper, saws, and gravers1) (Fig. 5). Such an ex- tensive set of specialized woodworking tools, as well as ethnographic analogies, support the sug- gestion that wood was used in the construction of various locks, enclosures, and traps for catching fish in the huge spawning runs. Further support comes from special "fish" knives (Fig. 4:3-5) at the Suvorovo IV and Usti- novka I sites, and from sculpted stone representa-</page><page sequence="3">VasiVevskii: Pacific Coast of Northeast Asia 283 Figure 2.

Both sculptures are shown in profile and are re- alistic. The characteristic details of the head and tail fin were worked with great mastery. They were shaped with unifacial edge retouch and longitudi- nal flake scars. One sculpture was made on a lamellar flake of siliceous tufa. It has a naturally formed characteristic hump, which is present on spawning salmon (Fig. 6:1). It is 8 cm long and 4.7 cm wide. The second sculpture was made from a flake of jasper-like stone of a dark green color. The ventral face of the flake is smooth, while the dor- sal face is covered with small flake scars, which form the head and the tail fin of the fish. The fig- urine is 7.3 cm long and 3.6 cm wide (Fig. 6:2). Fish sculptures may have been used as cult objects, fetishes, or simply to represent the pri- mary object of procurement. In any case, the fig- urines confirm the important role of fishing to the Ustinovka population. Such a conclusion is cor- roborated by ethnographic parallels. Among the peoples of the Lower Amur, fish had reached the very top of the "taiga pantheon." The arrival of the salmon to spawn and their procurement evoked strong emotional enthusiasm accompanied by various rituals and offerings to the water spirit. Fish representations in the form of drawings and appliqués are widely known in decorative art, on shamans' drums, and as pendants and amu- lets (Lopatin 1922). The Ustinovka sculptures described above might also be evidence of ritual plays connected with fish and river spirits at this site. Archaeological materials from the sites of the Ustinovka culture, according to most criteria, are similar to materials of the Sokol site on Sakhalin Island. The topographical and geomorphological conditions are also similar. The Sokol site is lo- cated at the mouth of a creek which flows into the Borshoi Takoi River, not far from the city of Dolinsk. Artifacts from the site include wedge- shaped cores, long (10 to 12 cm) blades, micro- blades, end scrapers, transverse burins, various types of knives, and bifaces. All tools are made of obsidian (Fig. 7). Analysis of seven obsidian artifact samples from the Sokol site indicates that the majority of them were made of Shirataki ob- sidian from northern Hokkaido. During the Late Pleistocene, when Sakhalin and Hokkaido were joined by an isthmus, northern Hokkaido evi- dently was an area of obsidian supply for the Sakhalin inhabitants. Sites of the Shirataki group on Hokkaido, dating from 15,000-10,000 BP, are similar to those on Sakhalin in typological and technological char- acteristics. The people lived under similar condi-</page><page sequence="4">284 Arctic Anthropology 35:1 Figure 3.

Their economy was based on fishing. Chronologically close to the sites of the Usti- novka culture of Primor'e are the sites of the Os- ipov culture of the Lower Amur. The lower level of the Osipov Gasia site has a radiocarbon date of 12,960 ± 120 (Le-1781). The site is located on the bank of the Amur River, near the well-known pet- roglyphs of Sakachi Alian. The stone industry of this site's lower layer is characterized by a blade technique based on wedge-shaped cores, bifacial blades, and diagonal burin spalls (Fig. 8). The Gasia complex is especially distinctive for its clay vessel fragments, the earliest known in northern Asia (Derevianko and Medvedev 1993). The site's inhabitants were primarily occupied with fishing. This is confirmed by the numerous finds of stone net sinkers. They were made of oval basalt cobbles and can be divided into three types, based on their manufacture. Some sinkers are girded at both ends by transverse grooves made by careful pecking (Fig. 9:1). Another type has longitudinal and trans- verse grooves (Fig. 9:2). A third type of sinkers has one transverse groove pecked around the circum- ference. The abundance of sinkers and their typo- logical variety point to the development of fishing as an independent form of economy. The early ap- pearance of clay vessels at the Gasia site also is ev- idently connected with fishing. The vessels were used for rendering fish oil. The late Paleolithic sites of Ushki I, II, IV, and V, located on the bank of Ushki Lake on the Kam- chatka Peninsula at the south edge of ancient Beringia, were seasonally occupied for salmon fishing (Fig. 10). For example, in the sixth level of the Ushki I site (with radiocarbon dates of 10,860 ± 400; 10,760 ± 110; and 10,360 ± 350 BP), the re- mains of 20 circular dwellings about 5 m in diam- eter were found. Both shallow pithouses with cor- ridor entries and surface dwellings of the wigwam type are known (Fig. 11). Inside some of the dwellings, circular hearths of large stones are pre- served, while in others only carbonaceous -ashy fired areas occur (Fig. 11). Fish (salmon) bones were found in all the hearths. Representations of fish were also found on the floor of one of the dwellings. The stone inventory of the fifth and sixth levels of the Ushki sites includes wedge- shaped cores, microblades, ski-shaped spalls, bifaces, bifacially worked points, scrapers, and skreblos (Fig. 12; Dikov 1977:44-82). By comparing the stone industries of sites of the Ustinovka, Osipov, and Ushki cultures, as well as the sites of Sokol and Shirataki, we find rather similar typological indicators. Differences can be seen only in some elements, such as the limited development of diagonal burin flaking at the Ushki sites in Kamchatka. The inventories of the Zerkal'naia River site in Primor'e and the Shirataki River sites (Shi- rataki, upper layer) on Hokkaido are especially similar to one another. The similarity extends be- yond the stone industry to the pattern of site loca- tion. Thus, in the Zerkal'naia River basin, sites are located in two concentrated groups: at Ustinovka (including the sites of Ustinovka I-VI) and at Su- vorovo (the sites of Suvorovo I-VII, and Sadovaia I-IV), located approximately 8 km downriver. In each group, three types of sites may be distin- guished: workshop sites (Ustinovka I, Suvorovo M), seasonal sites with a thin cultural layer (Usti- novka II, Suvorovo III), and sites with traces of long-term occupation, as demonstrated by abun- dant cultural remains, including tool ensembles (Ustinovka IV, Suvorovo IV). Each group of sites can be viewed as the archaeological equivalent of a "community." Members of a community occu- pied a definite territory and provided for their own existence. A similar situation is seen in the site location pattern of the Shirataki River basin on Hokkaido (Kimura 1985). There is a definite settlement and subsistence strategy reflecting tool production (procurement of raw materials and manufacture) and a fishing economy. The settlement pattern, in- cluding sites of seasonal and long-term duration, reflects a cycle of economic activities. Characteristic site similarities have been noted by ethnographers among peoples who de- pend upon fishing as their primary method of sub- sistence. Among the Nivkhi of Sakhalin, for exam- ple, winter or permanent settlements were situated far from the seashore on the upper reaches of rivers or in the forest. They consisted of pithouse dwellings. With the arrival of spring, warm tem- peratures, and the beginning of salmon runs (early fishing occurred in June), the Nivkhi moved to the coast to selected places for seasc nal fish camps. Summer dwellings of light construction were built at such sites. For each permanent settlement, there were two to three associated seasonal sites. Pro- cessing and preparation of fish took place at the seasonal sites (Krainovich 1973). Similar lifeways of fishing people are described for the Lower Amur (Lopatin 1922; Shrenk 1899). In addition, all investigators note that large salmon harvests dur- ing the spawning runs upriver could provide enough food for a settlement for a long period (Lopatin 1922:128). Such fishing efficiency was probably also found in prehistoric communities of the Zerkal'naia River basin. Thus, there is evi- dence for early semisedentism here, associated with twice yearly movements within the limits of a forest-shore territory. A different settlement system was found in Kamchatka.

They are located on points of land along the shore of Ushki Lake, which is joined by a channel with the Kamchatka River. All the sites are multi- component. The richest and most varied materials were obtained from the Ushki I site in Levels VI and V. It is possible that this was a base camp site founded during the period 10,300 to 10,500 BP. The arrangement of dwellings in the site is inter- esting: slightly depressed pithouses are arranged between tent-like surface dwellings (Dikov 1977) (Fig. 11). Thus, at Ushki I a whole group of varied but simultaneously occupied dwellings with identical tool kits is represented. Dwellings are situated</page><page sequence="12">292 Arctic Anthropology 35:1 Figure 12.

This is a true village settle- ment with characteristic features of sedentism. Such a pattern, combining winter pithouse dwellings and nearby "summer cabins" in a single settlement, was practiced by the Itermen and was described in de- tail by the Russian ethnographer Krasheninnikov (1755) in the mid-eighteenth century. Among the Itel'men and peoples of the Lower Amur, fishing was the most important occupation, while a pat- tern of winter and summer dwellings reflected a specific economic trend and its seasonal cycles. It is possible that settlement patterns formed under the influence of ecological and economic factors at the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary ulti- mately became traditional characteristics of fisher- men of the Pacific coast of Northeast Asia. Unfortunately, it is not possible to trace an uninterrupted sequence of sites in the Zerkal'naia River basin until the Neolithic period. Sites dating from 9000-8000 BP are unknown here at the pres- ent time. This can possibly be explained by a cooling trend that penetrated the region during the period of 8300-7900 BP. The Early Holocene cool- ing, as specialists point out, was accompanied by low temperatures and strong storms in the coastal zone and a worsening of conditions in the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk (Korotkii et al. 1988: 95-99, 160-166). These events could have brought about a migration of the population from the coast into interior regions of Primor'e. The reappearance of the pcpulation on the coast is fixed at about 7500 BP. This is attested by finds at the Rudnaia site located in Rudnaia Bay, near the mouth of the Rudnaia (Tetiukhe) River (44° 21' N, 135° 381 E). The site has two compo- nents. In the lower level, which is dated by the radiocarbon method to 7690 ± 80 and 7550 ± 60 BP, bifacially worked arrowpoints, knives, blade insets, scrapers, adzes, cobble sinkers, stone seal figurines, and clay vessels with narrow, flat bot- toms and decorated with rhombus designs were found. The settlement-subsistence patterns were oriented to maritime resources (D'iakov 1992). The upper level at Rudnaia revealed 20 pit- houses, including large ones with an area of 100 m2 (Okladnikov and Derevianko 1973:170-175; Brodianskii 1974:295-299). The appearance of such large settlement populations points to pro- gressive development of the economic system.</page><page sequence="13">VasiVevskii: Pacific Coast of Northeast Asia 293 Another interesting multicomponent site, Boisman 2, is located 170 km south of Vladivostok at the mouth of the Riazanovka River (42° 47' N, 131° 16' E) (Popov 1994). Three cultural horizons can be distinguished at the site. The upper horizon dates to the Iron Age, while the two lower hori- zons represent different stages of the Neolithic. Especially interesting is the lowest horizon of the site. It is associated with a shell midden measur- ing up to 1 m thick. A charcoal sample taken from a depth of 95 cm in this horizon gave a date of 6355 ± 60 BP, with a calibration of 5545-5077 BC (Kuzmin et al. 1994:362). The stone industry is characterized by knives, bifaces, unifacial knives, leaf-shaped spear points, ground and bifacially worked arrowpoints of several types, end scrapers, trapezoidal ground axes and adzes, and cobble net sinkers. There is a large series (more than 100 specimens) of bilater- ally and unilaterally barbed bone harpoon points, as well as toggling harpoons (three specimens) of the simplest form (Fig. 13). Among the other bone artifacts are found fishhooks, compound leisters, awls, needles, and figurines offish. Among the faunal remains, 40 species of mol- lusks were identified, chiefly oysters [Ostrea sp.), as well as the bones of fish, whales, seals, wild boar, Manchurian elk, and roe deer. These materials attest a complex economy, characterized by a combination of fishing, collect- ing sea mo Husks, and hunting of sea mammals and land animals. Neolithic economics, based on fishing, achieves its greatest effectiveness on the Lower Amur during the period 6000-5000 BP. A great series of large multicomponent sites with large, long-term semisubterranean dwellings is associ- ated with this period: Malyshevo, Voznesenovka, Kazakevicheva, Kondon, and Suchu (Okladnikov 1983; Okladnikov and Derevianko 1973:116-120). Populations living in these settlements were extensively connected with the Amur River and with fishing. These were true ichthyophages. The multicomponent nature of the sites and their con- tinuity over the course of thousands of years attest to the stability of an economic system based on fishing. The increase in settlement number and size points to the growth of the population. Qualitative changes occurred in the structure of the settlements as well. For example, at the Kondon site, which has a radiocarbon date of 4520 ± 20 BP, the large pithouses were not only Figure 13. Bone tools from the Boisman 2 site: (1-2) barbed harpoon points; (3) toggling harpoon point; (4) leister prong; (5) fishhook (after Popov 1994).</page><page sequence="14">294 Arctic Anthropology 35:1 dwelling quarters but also served other functions, such as social gathering places. Art also reached a high development. For ex- ample, the petroglyphs of Sakachi-Alian, with a predominance of anthropomorphic masks, are widely known (Fig. 14). Similar portrayals are also found on clay vessels, for example, at the Vozne- senovka site. Representations of the masks may possibly be connected with "first salmon" ritual ceremonies. At the Kondon site, a realistically exe- cuted clay statuette of a woman was found. At other Neolithic sites on the Amur, small art objects are often encountered, such as sculpted clay an- thropomorphic images and figures of bears (Oklad- nikov 1980). Owing to favorable ecological niches (the an- nual large spawning run of salmon on the Asian Pacific coast), Late Pleistocene people, facing an economic crisis as Paleolithic hunters, adapted comparatively easily to the coastal regions and river valleys. The development of intensive fish- ing, mainly based on salmon procurement, was part of this adaptation. Intensive fishing required a whole complex of conditions that can be con- firmed by Paleo-Asiatic ethnographic data: (1) col- lective participation in the acquisition and pro- cessing of the fish; (2) a system of knowledge about the biology of fish, the time of spawning and its cycles, and about methods of acquisition; and (3) special tools and devices (dams, weirs, wooden traps). Fishing became a very effective and stable procurement pattern and had broad ramifications for the economy. It initially contributed to the strengthening of societies in defined, limited terri- tories, and then led to early, pre-agricultural sedentism. The Ustinovka cultural traditions in Primor'e, Osipov in the Amur basin, and Ushki in Kamchatka are the foundations for the Neolithic of the maritime regions of Northeast Asia. Similar adaptations to new conditions and development of new economic occupations such as fishing also occurred in Hokkaido and northern Honshu (Akazawa 1980:325-344). End Note 1.
