The central question this study addresses is how did late eighteenth-century artists present the un- seen, configure an original thought, give shape to a new notion, imagining, or vision? Further, how did they exhibit elusive and dim states of mind that refuse to reveal themselves lucidly? How did those qualities which the beholderfeels structure the vis- ible surface of the work of art - although lacking &gt;&gt;bright&lt; articulation - become present to aware- ness and receive expression? Neither Johann Cas- par Lavater's monumental classificatory system for mapping the topography of the invisible, marking the apogee of classical physiognomics, nor Johann Heinrich Fuseli's or even William Blake's mimetic approach to apparitions, is adequate to the romantic method of fitting to- gether an intricate conception that does not exist prior to the act of making and perceiving. In- heritors of the Renaissance theory of imitation that valued likeness or similitudo, neoclassicists, such as Lavater and Fuseli, selected parts from nature, simplifying and abbreviating them'. By abstrac- tion, they avoided any signs of manufacture, dis- guising the hard lineamenta, patched &gt;features&lt;&lt; or rough lines that trace difficult and often lengthy thought processes.2 It is the latter, craft-like, pro- cedure that operates, I will argue, in Goya's Los Caprichos (composed between I793 and 1798 and published as a series in i799). As in the Disparates (18 16-1 823) and the Desastres de la guerra (1810o- &gt;If the body has nothing deranged, offensive, dark, rude, heterogeneous and patched, then everything in it is sound, then all is harmony, then... all becomes luminous. &lt; Lavater, ESSAYS IN PHYSIOGNOMY, III. &gt;&gt;L'homme sage n'est qu'un compose de molecules fol- les.&lt; Diderot, ELEMENTS DE PHYSIOLOGIE, [I778] 1820), blotched aquatint stains are shot through with &gt;&gt;wandering&lt;&lt; flashes of light in the manner of a textile or silver inlay, thereby indicating that such particolored imaginings are conspicuously pieced together. These wayward bits and tremulous nota- tions of light and shadow directly embody the form of a search for meaning - not the final solu- tion - and are congruent with the random pattern of life in a fallen world, one that is perpetually in the state of becoming. Arhythmic and ragged blots are &gt;,fine points&lt;&lt; offering technical evidence for the precise operations of the artist's phantasia, that faculty which &gt;&gt;bring[s] to light, make[s] to ap- pear,&lt;&lt; creates phantasias (visiones) or imaginary conceptualizations of absent things vividly pre- sented3. It is a commonplace of art theory from Quintilian to Reynolds that it is &gt;&gt;in the order of nature that we should conceive thoughts in the intellect before we enunciate them.&lt;&lt; Such figures &gt;&gt;make what we * I would like to thank the Wilson Center, Washington, D. C. where I was a Fellow from 1984-1985, for making this research possible. On homiotes, homoioma, homoios or similitudo, see J. J.

The preexistence of luminous and well-digested ideas is corroborated in the ninth Discourse. Reynolds, musing on the elusive beauty every artist seeks, finds it to be general and intellectual, preceding practice or the process of material embodiment. &gt;It is an idea that subsists only in the mind; the sight never beheld it, nor has the hand expressed it: it is an idea residing in the breast of the artist, which he is always labouring to impart, and which he dies at last without impart- ing,5. This passage, moreover, indicates the im- portant belief entrenched in academic teaching that there are things which cannot be given form by means of earth pigments and other unelevated materials. Reynolds' lament surely is based on Socrates' question to Parrhasius (Xenophon, Memorabilia, 3. 10, 3 and 5): &gt;Do you not imitate the character of the soul?&lt;&lt; To which the Greek painter replies: &gt;But how could such a thing be im- itated, Socrates, which has neither commensurable proportions, or color, nor any of the things which you mentioned just now, and which in fact, is not even visible?&lt;&lt;6 My intention is to investigate another, com- plementary, tradition, one that turns from Quinti- lian's approval of natural sententiae, the imitation of recombined thoughts, or of whatever already is &gt;conceived in the mind,&lt; to the forbidden con- struction of the non-existent, of ingenious concep- tions, or painted neologisms. These unnatural tropes deviate from the instrumentality of artistic language. Their minute, roving &gt;flashes&lt;&lt; (le clin- quant) stand out and &gt;glitter&lt;&lt; in the dark not like the blending light of a flame but like unequal and broken &gt;&gt;sparks appearing among smoke&lt;&lt;7. As Quintilian argues - while urging a middle &gt;&gt;shaded? course, steering between the showy and the obscure - such &gt;detours&lt;&lt; are most reprehen- sible when ?far-fetched.&lt;&lt; Invoking the artistic voc- abulary of chiaroscuro, he deems execrable those ?painted points,? argutiae, ?subtleties? that fit- fully, and for a moment only, make bright or ob- servable the disorder of irregular and antithetical elements8. Upholding the model of a gradual, im- perceptible, transition between light and shade, he abjures the oppressive crowding of ideas that leads to obstructed vision. In a painting, objects ought to be kept clear and distinct by the insertion of in- tervals. Without such unobtrusive intervening spaces style becomes curt, &gt;&gt;for every thought makes as it were a stand, as being complete in itself, therefore, language is too unconnected, composed not of members but of bits, and these round and polished portions refuse to unite&lt;9. From a different vantage these fragmentary, re- percussive, even intensely pleasurable or painful - because unmodulated - &gt;&gt;fits&lt;&lt; of light'o and blots of dark must be connected to those other bold &gt;patches&lt;&lt; and grylli which refuse to blend, namely, grotesques. The &gt;&gt;varied cargo,&lt;&lt; capri- cious or ?light stuff,&lt;&lt; and strange mixtures &gt;&gt;worth nothing&lt;&lt; carried by a peddlar or decocted by a per- fumer are deemed analogous, by Horace and Pausanias, to the worthless combinations of a painter who unites such glaringly disparate and ill- assorted trivia as a human body with the neck of a horse or the torso of a beautiful woman with the tail of a fish". But it is Origen and the Christian homiletic trad- ition that specifically binds together cheap, vulgar, irregular, flashing trinkets with a multiplicity of distracting mosaic tesserae: both stand equally dis- tant from the simple radiance and uniformity of pure gold.

They are &gt;&gt;not the very image of the things,&lt;&lt; i.e., not true gold or light without parts, &gt;but only the Truth's shadow.&lt;&lt; When, according to Origen, things shall lie open, absolutely visible and disclosed at the Ressurrec- tion, all will then be copious and free. Likenesses will not be imprisoned in narrow channels, &gt;&gt;not now like a little inlay, but as spread out in all their breadth?~2". The echo of Origen is heard in all those theorists who, like Lavater, maintain that artistic genius is manifest in imitations that &gt;&gt;are not an as- semblage of small pieces assorted and inlaid: he [the original genius] melts down his materials, and, by a skillful disposition, forms of them one homogeneous whole; and this reproduction ap- pears so new, so different from a vulgar composi- tion, that it passes for an Original, that we look upon it as ideal, as an invention. The painter is creator of his portraits, the sculptor of his statues, much in the same sense that the chymist is creator of metals&lt;&lt;'3. That is to say, and following a vener- able architectural analogy, none of these creates. All only harmoniously select and seamlessly dis- pose without evident sign of &gt;&gt;fit,&lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt;jointing&lt;&lt;, in the work's physical parts after the manner of the overall concord of courses of blocks found in a stone building'4. Significantly, this exemplum, with its craft associations to the builder's art, refers to smooth ashlar masonry not to rubble layers or to fissures evident in heavy rustication. Further, Origen suggests, in his Homilies on Exodus and the Beginning of the Decalogue, that these discordant inlays are not likenesses but idols or a &gt;&gt;nothing in the world.&lt;&lt; For, according to St. Paul (I Cor. 8: 4), he has made an idol who &gt;&gt;makes what is not. A form which the eye does not see, but which the mind imagines for itself. For example, if someone should fashion the head of a dog or a ram or human members, or again devise two faces on one appearance, or join the hindmost parts of a horse or a fish to a human breast&lt;&lt;5. The protean grotesque, which incarnates the possibility for the turning of everything into anything (depending on the skill and desire of the artist), is, therefore, a no- thing in itself. Moreover, it is also associated with the negation of the material world, with that &gt;&gt;darkness of errors which is dense and capable of being touched.&lt;&lt; This &gt;&gt;gloom&lt;&lt; of vice deprived of light places &gt;&gt;obscurity&lt;&lt; before the eyes. Voltaire, in his Dictionnaire philosophique (1764), derives idole from the Greek Eidos (image) and Eidolon (the representation of an image), to which are added the Latin connotations of &gt;&gt;to serve&lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt;to re- vere.&lt;&lt; He comments ironically that the difference between the tenebrous and irrational idols of the pagan Carthaginians and Babylonians and the statues of Christianity is that &gt;&gt;leurs images figuraient des &amp;tres fantastiques, dans une religion fausse, et que les n6tres figurent des etres reels dans une religion v6ritable.&lt;&lt; Most significant are his quotations from Horace's satires and from Baruch to the effect that gods will be only what the craftsman wills. &gt;&gt;Faire des dieux,&lt;&lt; means literally, as Horace, Ovid, Statius, Lucan noted, for a car- penter to take a trunk of a fig tree and decide whether to make a bench or a herm of Priapus. The material is the same in either case; what differs is how it is done, the manner in which it is put to- gether, thereby making exist what is not. The wood of the cherubim of the Holy of Holies, ac- cording to the philosophe, might just as well have been a kitchen table or &gt;&gt;aurait pii servir 6galement aux fonctions les plus viles&lt;&lt; '6 12 Origen, An Exhortation to Martyrdom, Prayer, First Principles: Book IV, Prologue to the Commentary of the Song of Songs, Homily XXVII on Numbers, trans. by Rowan A.

As falsehood and unclarity owe to the obscuring multiplicity of phenomena - whether we are speaking of the bibli- cal or the Platonic and Neo-Platonic traditions - so Phantasius, according to the Encyclopedie, is a deceptive god producing counterfeits, ?fausses im- ages de ce qu'ils regardaient... Ce sont la des er- reurs de l'imagination, et c'est des fant6mes qu'elle se fait, que le mot phantase a tire sa naissance&lt;&lt;?7. Similarly, fant6mes are imaginings &gt;&gt;qui n'y sont point,&lt;&lt; not unrelated to illusion or 4le mensonge des apparences,&lt;&lt; or to l'abstraction, ?le contraire de concret,&lt;&lt; or to the chimerical ideal which &gt;s'oppose a reel&lt;&lt; and is not &gt;un etre qui ait exist&lt;&lt;". The synonyms: tenebres, obscuritY, nuit are the antitheses of radiance and denote privation, cessation of illumination. Ombre is a place devoid of light whose passage is obstructed by the inter- position of an opaque body with obliterates it (from blottir, the root of the English &gt;&gt;to blot&lt;&lt;)'9. In addition, Dr. Johnson's Dictionary links fan- tasma, phantasma with &gt;&gt;fancied apparitions,&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;a thing not real, but appearing to the imagination.&lt;&lt; These are not unlike the idol or counterfeit2o. The language of besmirched absence in contradistinc- tion to the fullness of &gt;&gt;fair&lt;&lt; perfection is accen- tuated when he treats of dark, darken, darkness, obscuration, obscure, obscurely. Not only do these words suggest the &gt;opake, not transparent,&lt;&lt; but, in contrast to &gt;&gt;vivid color,&lt;&lt; they signify &gt;to cloud,&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;to foul,&lt;&lt; &gt;to sully&lt;&lt; by the ?lusts and pas- sions of men&lt;&lt; the perspicuous and enlightened mind. The state of being &gt;&gt;intellectually clouded? or &gt;&gt;dull&lt;&lt; betokens &gt;&gt;ignorance, uncertainty,&lt;&lt; &gt;in- ternal gloom,? and, by extension, ?wickedness,? ?the empire of Satan, or the Devil&lt;&lt;2. As the En- cylopidie further notes, borrowing from as- tronomy, the nebuleux is the pale unresolvable light of those remote stars which appear ?comme des petits nuages, ou des petites taches obscures.&lt;&lt; This concealing, darksome hindrance of sight not only makes things ?less visible,&lt;&lt; less intelligible&lt;&lt; but also &gt;less glorious.&lt;&lt; That which is not &gt;&gt;plain&lt;&lt; or extended in the open air but private, internal, vain, airy, and out of sight, is contrasted by the En- cyclopedie to the brilliant, lustre, eclat, that is, to vivid colors and large objects, clear colors and small objects, and to recently painted, or florid (i.e., without varnish) colors and new objects". These examples involving the concept of glaring, not soothing, shade, imply the sense of perceptible screen, tangible blocking of a golden light by worthless, trivial, multiple appearances. This seems true whether speaking of the soul separated from the body at death because of original sin, or, while dreaming, when empty fancies, wild con- ceits of &gt;something which does not really hap- pen,&lt;&lt; live apart from, and out of the control of, the rational will (as in spirit, ghost, manes)23. There is also the analogous condition of the mind's being in the dark, vacated by the understanding because of perplexing, fitful, and incongruent ideas; or, as in painting, the sharply umbraged &gt;points&lt;&lt; of a di- visionist picture that harshly intercept - not gently shelter through graduated light - the brightly col- ored areas and thus negate them24. Skiagraphia, or &gt;&gt;shadow painting,&lt;&lt; depicts the appearance of shading on the surface of form. This chiaroscuro technique, said to have been invented by the Athenian Apollodorus (late 5 B.C.) utilizes both the ?fading out&lt;?

For Plato Republic, 523B), objects painted in this shadowy way were like things seen obsurely at a distance, but, by the time of Pliny, this technique featured patches of strongly contrasting colors which intensified each other when viewed close up but blended into luminous effects when seen from an appropriate distance26. Chiaroscuro, as the fragmenting of unitary, solid, homogeneous sur- faces into juxtaposed and contrasting atomistic particles of lumen et umbrae, is a metaphor for the destruction of the intactness of pure gold, lumin- ous Being, health, the Beautiful, by the spotted inlay, dark becoming, blemished disease, and the variegated grotesque. The connotation of &gt;&gt;pointed?&lt; light and shade, sharps and flats, dart- ing, hooked flecks of pleasure and pain - the ram- shackled ruins left when the radiant One became the barbarous Many - can also be found within the Christian tradition. St. Paul states that only after the Last Judgment will we look upon an &gt;&gt;unveiled face? and be &gt;face to face.&lt;&lt; At that time we, too, shall be immaculate, without &gt;spot or wrinkle or any such thing but.., holy and without blemish&lt;&lt;7. Lavater, the Evangelical minister en- gaged in the exhaustive and &gt;scientific?&lt; disclosure of the invisible mental faculties of man by the analysis of the motley lineaments of the visible parts, invokes, at the beginning of The Essays on Physiognomy (1775 - 1778) the words of the Apos- tle. &gt;Now we know but in part, and our explana- tions, our commentaries are nothing but frag- ments; but when perfection is come, these feeble essays shall be abolished. For they are hitherto only the ill-articulated language of a child, and these same ideas, these efforts shall appear childish to me, when I arrive at maturity. Now we see the glory of a man darkly as through a veil; we shall ere long behold face to face. Now we know but imper- fectly, but I shall soon know, as I myself have been known...&lt;&lt;28 The main section of this study examines four in- terrelated means by which late eighteenth-century philosophic, aesthetic, physiognomic, and medical theory devised ways to visualize the invisible and how these strategies differed from classical con- ventions. The culminating figure is Goya whose Caprichos I propose to place within the context of a larger body of European criticism on the illicit fabrication of idiosyncratic thoughts. Characteris- tics of Goya and of the romantic period are his handling of indecorous &gt;&gt;blots&lt;&lt; as obstrusive symptoms of diseased surface uniformity, the rulelessness of his painted detours, and his impro- per uses of chiaroscuro. First I will establish a cor- relation between the overt processes of making conceptions and conspicuously putting together works of art. In both instances, the material joints or inlays show. Second, the presentation of the un- seen devolves upon the recognition that both im- aginary space and the phenomenal world are really populated by mixed entities. Therefore the gro- tesque, or the mis-formed bit and mis-matched patch, becomes the universal idiom for expressing the farfetched: that dim knowledge of scattered oc- casions conveyed to people who &gt;speak? different visual languages. Third, the difficulty of establish- ing an analogy between the two realms of the sen- suous and the mental gives rise to changing defin- tions of allegory. It shifts from being a system of intellectual signs arbitrarily applied without re- gard to their external form, operative at the begin- ning of the eighteenth century, to a natural &gt;por- trait&lt;&lt; of the passions, at its mid-point, and, finally, at its close, to an artificial compound blot or idea and feeling.

Deliberately disarranged chiaroscuro becomes, like cloisonne, the synthetic medium in which to trace the wayward path of the creator's fantasy. All four issues bear on the prob- lem of the pursuit of unity in a fragmented or fallen world. * &gt;For mind and intelligence in and of themselves no statuary or painter will ever be able to represent; for all men are utterly incapable of observing such attri- butes with their eyes or learning of them by inquiry.&lt;&lt; Dio Chrysostom voices the Platonic prejudice that the greatest conceptions have no parallel vis- ual image29. This commonplace of philosophy is undermined in three important ways during the course of the eighteenth century fueled, by what Robert Burton called, that ?itching humor&lt;&lt; or curiosity &gt;or a kind of longing to see that which is not be seen, to do that which ought not to be done: to know that secret which should not be known, to eat of the forbidden fruit&lt;&lt;30. John Yolton recently argued that the &gt;way of ideas?&lt; from Descartes to Reid is marked by the growing emphasis among certain thinkers on the direct apprehension of real- ity3'. Since it is crucial for my argument concern- ing the possibility for presenting ideas in art, I will briefly summarize the triple progression towards the corporealization of ideas he traced, beginning with Descartes and Malebranche's entity-ideas. According to this thesis, for a physical thing to be in the mind does not mean that it is made by the mind, i.e., it is not a fictive &gt;third&lt;&lt; being of reason but a real object conceived; it achieves an epistemic reality32. This ontic view of spiritual entities is re- jected by Arnauld in favor of perception-ideas. He argues, in Des vraies et desfausses idles (1683), that there is a difference between our perception-ideas and objects in the world but, significantly, there are no intermediary entities that do the represent- ing. It is our ideas that we see immediately; what is outside the mind is the mediate object of the mind. We see both idea and thing without any represen- tative medium or varnish between our perceptions and the object33. Yolton also reinterprets Ber- keley's New Theory of Vision (1709) and The Prin- ciples of Human Knowledge (17 10), stating that the philosopher argues for changing ideas into things not things into ideas. Important, and close to Hume, is Berkeley's argument that an &gt;idea&lt;&lt; sig- nifies the &gt;&gt;several combinations of sensible qual- ities&lt;&lt; and thus is linked with actions and passions. These combinations or compounds are the ordi- nary things of our environment existing in, cog- nized, by the mind34. This commonsense realism is shared by Hume, for whom it is inconceivable to have a notion of an external world utterly different from what we experience or see. In the Treatise of Human Understanding (1739), Hume broaches a key question: can ideas be extended and, thus, have shape? For Hume an idea is as complex as a perception and literally yoked to physical qual- ities; it is conjoined with properties of color and 29 Dio Chrysostom (of Prusa), The Twelfth, or Olympic, Discourse: On Man's First Conception of God, in Works, II, trans. by J.

Part of this conceptual in- tricacy results from the fact that an emotion &gt;sec- retly attends every idea.&lt;&lt; Since an object present to mind is a notional nexus of reflections and passions arrayed in colors and possessing tangibility it is simultaneously seen and felt as a discrete thing35. To put it in aesthetic terms, it is a charged idea, a small illuminated and shaded patch, blot, or con- juncted &gt;thought and affect&lt;&lt; that has been fitted together and may be conceived to exist separately in the universe. It is precisely this language of matter and physical raiment that the Platonic and Neoplatonic philosophers - and the neoclassical art theorists conditioned by them - wished to avoid when speaking of the inventions of the mind. Thus J. G. Sulzer, in his &gt;New Examination of the Word Thought&lt; (1774), concludes that in works of art &gt;thoughts are what remain of a performance when stripped of its embellishment.&lt;&lt; A poet's thoughts are what last in an unadorned state, independent of the versification, just as &gt;the dress in which they appear, or the form into which they are moulded by the artist, is merely accidental.&lt;&lt; Sulzer exhorts the beholder of a history painting to forget that &gt;&gt;magic art&lt;&lt; which &gt;by lights and shades created bodies where there are none,&lt;&lt; to forget those idiosyncratic impressions, marks, touches, charac- ters, notes of the maker, and ?fancy to yourself that you are actually looking at men&lt;&lt;36. For the German art theorist, as for Reynolds, an idea is a proxy object37 - bodiless and chimerical - rep- resented staticaly in our reproductive imagination, not the vivid presentation of a real and mutable being that possesses the force and energy of a di- rect perception. The supposition that the universe is filled with &gt;roving&lt;&lt; animate images (animantes imagines), conveying not only the physical likeness of the ob- ject emitting them but also its intentions and feel- ings, originated not with Hume but with the Epicureans38. In this philosophy all images, whether external or mental, were equally real. Ladened with the mote-like effluvia of interming- ling and heterogeneous ideas and desires, not just with the homogeneous simulacra of visual and au- ditory representations, they could exert a palpable and continuing effect on a receptive perceiver39. This non-anthropocentric and milieu-oriented system, so influential among eighteenth-century materialists, had been embattled at least since the iconoclastic controversy. The fear of paying hom- age to a material thing had latent in it the view of ordinary matter as evil. As St. John Damascene stressed (and Sulzer's views are but a pale reflec- tion of this polemic): one could burn the board on which the pigments are laid since the reverence paid to the icon is addressed to the person rep- resented, passing through the wood to God. Or as St. Theodore of Studium, an early ninth-century iconophile, comments: a likeness reproduced in a mirror has nothing in common with the matter of the mirror40. Lavater extends this anti-materialist bias to physiognomics or the interpretation of the unchanging &gt;signs of the faculties.? Lamenting the impossibility of conceptual embodiments, he asks: 4Is the image of fire to be conveyed by china- ink, light by a crayon, the expression of life by clay and oil? It is with physiognomy as with every 35 Yolton, Perceptual Acquaintance, I54-157, 196-I99; and David Hume, A Treatise of Human Understanding (1739).

Etching other object of taste, from the most grossly mate- rial, up to the most delicately refined.., we feel but are incapable of expressing our sensations&lt;&lt;4. That man is always in his sensations, experiencing a compound idea plus perception, smell, touch, struck the materialist Diderot. As a student of the passions, a follower of the Montpellier vitalists P. J. Barthez and Theophile Bordeu, he was incapable of separating body and soul into dual and oppos- ing substances. Rather, he declared the aime to be identical with the pensee: mobile, extended, sensi- ble, and composite42. Physicians had long known that ideas could be painful since out of the sharp- ness of choler &gt;&gt;proceed[s] much waking, trouble- some thoughts and dreams.&lt;&lt; Burton chastizes those &gt;&gt;curious wits&lt;&lt; who &gt;&gt;macerate&lt;&lt; themselves, tiring their souls in &gt;tedious [mental] journies.&lt;&lt; During fits of melancholy, the pangs of fantasy are so acute they often &gt;&gt;hurt,&lt;&lt; producing many mon- strous and prodigious things. These tangible &gt;&gt;per- turbations of the mind&lt;&lt; come and go like light and shade, alternating between thoughts of anguish or &gt;&gt;anticks&lt;&lt;43. Seeing the finer points of irritability and sensibility was excruciatingly demonstrated in the 1730's and 1740's by the G6ttingen physiologist Albrecht Haller - much admired by Diderot - who made visible by meticulous animal dissection &gt;&gt;the most trifling moving cause&lt;&lt; of muscular and nervous commotion44. But com- municating an actual idea of pain or, with Hume in mind, what was the same thing, incarnating a pain- ful idea, was the province of the caricaturists. It was the genius of such &gt;low art&lt;&lt; comic draftsmen as James Gillray (1757- 1815), Isaac (i756- 18 11 ?) and George (1792 - 1878) Cruikshank, and Hon- ore Daumier (18o8 - 1879), among a host of others, to conceptualize, with its attendant emotive qual- ities, both physical and mental vexation. Signific- antly, images of the Gout (fig. i) or Cholic (figs. 2, 3) are direct presentations of the gnawing, searing, tightening, sawing sensation itself, not a mimetic representation or portrait of muscular movements. This principle of corporealizing an animated and complex idea is evident when George Cruikshank tackles the Blue Devils (fig. 4), or melancholy, made famous by Diirer's static and recondite alleg- ory. For the British satirist, the fiendish miseries of domestic life are paraded as a mixture of the laugh- 4' Lavater, Essays, I, ioo. 42 Denis Diderot, Eliments de physiologie (1778), ed. by Jean Mayer, Paris 1964, 53, 58. 43 Burton, Anatomy, 12, 23, 34, 168.

Distraction, or not attending to an ex- ternal world, is also indicated in the wayward, patched together, wandering train of thoughts that pour out pell-mell at the supposition of being cuck- olded (fig. 5). Cruikshank's prosaic inscape pic- turing Revenge fits together in seemingly random order common, or ordinary language, scenes of as- signation, hanging, shooting, visual puns (horned devils), alliterative animations (a tea kettle whist- ling derisively). Similarly, Daumier conjures up Misanthropy (fig. 6) with its vertiginous incon- stancy, restlessness, inability to resolve upon a de- cided course of action. The misanthrope tangibly reveals the distracted contents of his brain as perplexity over whether to poison or drown him- self. Irresolution is demonstrated as the grotesque conjunction of the will with the will not, the to and fro agitation of a restless mind, the fitful thoughts . . . . . . . . ?

Lithograph tradictions, and infinite varieties, is predicated on the production of a ?disagreeing likeness&lt;&lt;47. As Diderot comments, strong emotion interrupts both memory and a seamless stream of conscious- ness, thereby abruptly juxtaposing bits and pieces of different and non-resembling thoughts48. Since these apprehensions are the things themselves fit- fully brought into contiguity, it is possible to originate a new idea-entity, to produce a mixed neologism that has a real status in the world, in short, to create an unheard of thought that lives beyond the geography of the mind. The interanimation of artistic and philosophic vocabularies hinges on the inseparability of the discussion concerning the conception of images by the painter from that of the formation of thoughts by the philosopher. For both types of investiga- tion, the central issue is how a notion is ?realizedo in a visible, formal structure. Further, the charac- ter of the resulting work is dependent upon the de- finition of idea that is operative. Reynolds, Fuseli, Sulzer, Mengs, Winckelmann, and Lavater hark back to the Neoplatonic concept - shared with Ficino - that there can be no ideas of accidental, circumstantial, artificial things49.

Engraving is characterized by ideas that exist in the intellect before anything is made (fig. 7). When, however, as among the modern Epicureans, the idea is de- fined as a potential construction only discovered in the process of actualization, it takes on a complex- ity and unpredictability dependent upon the delib- erations and choices that occur while it is being made5?.

Hence the art of discovery is artisanal, involving the original sense of mimesis as dramatic enactment and &gt;&gt;reem- bodiment&lt;&lt;52. Lacombe, in his Spectacle des beaux- arts (1763), elaborates on the performative &gt;&gt;talent d'op6rer.&lt;&lt; The almost magical ability to operate or to execute &gt;&gt;c'est r6aliser aux yeux les productions du g6nie&lt;&lt;53. This manual procedure, exhibiting distinctive touches, is the physical counterpart to the facultas fingendi, that material imagination which fabricates phantasms by means of separat- ing and recombining things anteriorly perceived by the senses54. The dangerous language of the sorcerer's mani- pulations that ?faire voir des choses qui n'ont au- cune r&amp;alite, soit en fasqinant les yeux des spec- tateurs, soit en formant des spectres,&lt;&lt; lived on in the eighteenth-century debate over the veracity of miracles. Carr6 de Montgeron's monumental La VWrite des miracles (1745) makes plain the nature of the religious opposition to the conception of the maker as either creator of original works or ideas. &gt;&gt;Les merveilles rdelles&lt;&lt; are those which God oper- ates, whereas ?les phant6mes fabriqus&lt;&lt; are the phantasmagorical artifices of Satan. The devil's prodigies and protean monsters are false and purely ostentatious, whereas real miracles are use- fuls5. If ideas are not innate, if we are not born endowed by God with all our thoughts, then we have to make the majority of our notions by a lifetime's ac- tivity and operation of the mind. &gt;&gt;Be rejoiced,&lt;&lt; says Shaftesbury, &gt;&gt;when skillfully and like a mas- ter you have modelled or well-fabricated some one appearance or idea&lt;56. Further, if ideas are not nor- mative and inborn, then the imagination has great- er license to wander, and all the accidents of na- ture, says Diderot, are but &gt;,d'occasions de s'6garer.&lt;&lt; The senses cause ,&gt;distraction,&lt;&lt; detour- ing the animal spirits while the soul (Ame) is re- flecting on higher matters. Le Camus, in his Medicine de l'esprit (I753), identifies a host of aberrant traits that characterize the &gt;&gt;esprit alien&amp;&lt;&lt; left to its own unguided devices in a profane world: its complex ideas are marked by inatten- tion, abandoning 4le naturel pour donner dans les hyperboles &amp; les exagerations continuelles, &amp; qui quittent le solide pour courir apres le clinquant &amp; le Phoebus&lt;&lt;57. The illicit or &gt;&gt;der&amp;glee&lt;&lt; diversions of the imagination away from the natural and the God-given, entail a fall &gt;&gt;dans une structure choquante de mots bizarrement assembl&amp;s... dans des antith&amp;ses.&lt; Again, the language that censures grotesque ravings and rovings away from the straight and narrow, is that of the defenders of God as the sole creator, &gt;&gt;que le seul maitre de la nature qui puisse tirer les tres du neant&lt;&lt;8.

Dioptrical glasses reveal the flaws and deficiencies of acquired art. A line drawn upon paper, thus observed, &gt;&gt;appears all ragged, in- dented, and discontinued by the rugosities and seeming protuberances of the paper, in which likewise you may see whole clouds, as it were of raggs&lt;&lt;59. Chemistry, according to Sticotti, &gt;&gt;ne produit rien de nouveau,&lt;&lt; only assortments and combinations6'. Since God alone is perfect, and deformities and disproportions are endemic to the sublunar world, a leitmotiv of art theory is that the painter must retrace without distortion the works of the creator and this according to a model of superior beauties he has formed in his mind. It is a &gt;&gt;transgression,&lt;&lt; a &gt;&gt;vice,&lt;&lt; a &gt;&gt;deviation,&lt;&lt; an &gt;&gt;error,&lt;&lt; to attempt to produce original creations instead of imitations6 The right and wrong physiognomy of a thought: clear, simple, free of all delusion and extravagance, plain, masculine, in contrast to shaded, far- fetched, mixed, deceptive, turned to its own use, persuasive, and feminine, clearly depends upon the theological language of the just and the unjust, the terrible brilliance of the great and righteous and the blotched darkness of the small and ugly62. It is precisely such unguided and monstrous thoughts that voyage within the mind, &gt;&gt;out of the way?&lt; conjectures that range freely, yoking together dis- parate things, which constitute deliberate crea- tions. According to Fuseli, what Quintilian termed visiones, translating the Greek &gt;&gt;phan- tasies,&lt;&lt; were those &gt;&gt;unpremeditated conceptions&lt;&lt; that pursue us when the mind is in a state of rest or revery. This sudden intuition is &gt;&gt;the power by which absent images of things are represented by the mind with the energy of objects moving before our eyes.&lt;&lt; For Fuseli, as for Winckelmann, this chimerical, extraordinary, and ideal fiction for which no external model exists is like a form abstracted from matter, the result of several per- ceptions united in thought, but the personal as- semblage itself does not exist in nature. Watelet, in his Dictionnaire, adds that the iddal is private, it concerns the particular manner in which each artist conceives his art, actualizes his thought63. What is missing from this neoclassical definition, however, is precisely the quality of premeditation associated with craft, the process of minutely in- laying a thought-entity. Further, it avoids the rec- ognition that complex notations are the result of distractions within the topography of matter, not generalizing abstractions from it, and thus the art- ist contributes his own substance to the materials of art. Unlike Fuseli, who declared that invention is not to be confounded with creation since the lat- ter is &gt;admissible only when we mention omnipo- tence,&lt;&lt; Hagedorn extols those chance beauties which are not to be found &gt;&gt;dans la premiere pen- s6e.&lt; Indeed, in most cases, the execution of a painting &gt;est une invention continue et toujours agissante... cette configuration, cette cr6ation, si j'ose m'exprimer ainsi, qui permet aux Artistes de nos jours de s'&amp;crier avec ce Peintre d'antiquit6: il est plus agreable de peindre que d'avoir peint.&lt; Re- 59 Henry Power, Experimental Philosophy in Three Books: Containing New Experiments Microscopical, Mercurial, Magnetical, London 1664, 53. 6o A.

The struggle against the thesis that all ideas are adopted involves the overturning of the Platonic commonplace that the poet raves disembodedly with a wisdom not his own, over which he has no rational control. The same topos functions within the Christian tradition in which a prophet com- municates nothing of his own being but speaks foreign thoughts give him by another. It is pre- cisely this material exuberance and superfluity, the &gt;&gt;contribution&lt;&lt; of the painter's own ideas, the &gt;&gt;ad- dition&lt;&lt; of thoughts without subtraction of any that are patently present, that provide evidence for the new supplements to knowledge produced for the first time by the imagination65. Here, too, we can locate the reason behind the growing resent- ment among eighteenth-century artists against the tyranny of the poets and the amateurs: those &gt;&gt;don- neurs d'ides&lt;&lt; excoriated by Falconet. Painter or sculptor, he declares, must know how to think and compose, &gt;&gt;de rendre sa pense.&lt;&lt; Creation, or the presentation of the hitherto nonexistent, the fabri- cation of a neologism, depends upon the display of the workman's hand which, as Falconet says, de- monstrates that the artist is &gt;&gt;un &amp;tre pensant&lt;&lt;66. &gt;&gt;Surely... never were so many efforts made as in our day, to violate the sanctuary of the breast, and the most secret emotions of the human heart.&lt;&lt; The desire to visibilize the invisible67, at the core of eighteenth-century discussions on the presenta- tion of ideas, entailed a corporealization of the soul. While unintentional, this effect is nowhere more in evidence than in Lavater's system of physiognomics in which the most impalpable functions were called upon to exhibit sensible signs68. This divining of another world, one that is internal rather than external, paradoxically raised the status of the body and with it of sense. One aesthetic repercussion was the disruption of a composition's seamless unity; it made it difficult to maintain with Watelet: &gt;&gt;du corps &amp; de l'esprit invisible assemblage.&lt;&lt; The intangible &gt;&gt;tout-en- semble&lt;&lt; or general order of a painting, that had been compared since the Renaissance to an analog- ous &gt;&gt;tissu myst&amp;rieux, invisible&gt;&gt; functioning in the universe as a &gt;&gt;chaine presque entierement cache6 nos yeux, d'o i r6sulte l'existence suivie &amp; con- s6quente de tout dont nos sens jouissent,&lt;&lt; was shattered6'. Neoclassicism's emphasis on the acquisition of clear and distinct ideas, based on gathering &gt;&gt;un heureux assemblage sans apper- qevoir aucun d6faut, ni aucune imperfection&lt;&lt; (Al- garotti), or the abstracting of a central form, every deviation from which is &gt;&gt;deformity&lt;&lt; (Reynolds), would come under attack by those determined to 64 Fuseli, Lectures, io6; Hagedorn, Reflexions, I, I5o; Pierre Remond de Sainte-Albine, Le Comidien, Ouv- rage divise en deux parties, Paris 1749, 22, 25.

The Montpellier vitalists, who originated in that great medical faculty at mid-century and reached their apogee at Paris in the 1790's, were responsi- ble for shaping the view of man as an autonomous, corporeal, and kinetic entity endowed with decen- tralized forces. As the famous physician Barthez commented, without a passive body directed by a dominant soul, it would be impossible to recog- nize in man a unity of form. The fear of such a &gt;monstrous&lt;&lt; disintegration colored Lavater's as- sumption concerning the homogeneity of man: &gt;He is always one and the same,&lt;&lt; like nature, which composes at a single cast; &gt;her organiza- tions are not inlaid work.&lt;&lt; The unnaturalness of pan-consciousness, in contrast to a divine or &gt;monarchic&lt;&lt; model in which the body is com- manded by a unique ruler is underscored when he asserts that a production resembles &gt;mosaic work&lt;&lt; if the &gt;parts are not derived from one common stem, which transfuses its sap to the remotest branch&lt;&lt;7'. The vitalist insistence that each part of the body is alive, active, sensitive, was com- plemented by those modern Pythagoreans who admitted the existence of a plurality of souls. The doctrine of transmigration materialized souls, claiming they acted autonomously as if in charge of 4le principe de leur creation&lt;&lt; as they peregri- nated without any certain course from one body into another. While not upholding transmigration, Barthez nevertheless discusses thinkers like Fran- cis Bacon, Van Helmont, and Ralph Cudworth, who multiplied the immanent and mobile vital principles subsisting within a single individual dis- tingishing them from the fixed ime. The impor- tance of the physiological &gt;travels&lt;&lt; of a wandering and constantly distracted sensibility, summoned to one or another nerve ending, is that it made pos- sible a new and heterogeneous unity. This princi- ple of composition - whether functioning within the work of art or within the human physiology - was based on intermixing or inlaying varigated parts and autonomous living organs into a dynamic configuration. Since, as Diderot claimed, &gt;&gt;sentir c'est vivre,&lt;? man, of necessity, exists many divergent ways at once as he actively engages with the changing external milieu: in the state of inertia, sensibility, or of vegetable, polyp, animal, and human, life72. The realization of this human ability to be unlike, eccentric, caused Georg Christoph Lichtenberg to question Lavater's affirmation of the universality of physiognomic discernment. Lichtenberg coun- ters the statement that the physiognomist &gt;deter- mines for every passion the seat of its residence, the source from which it flows, its root, the fund which supplies it,&lt;&lt; by asking, &gt;if the exterior bears the impress of the interior, does it follow that this impression must be visible to us?&lt;&lt; For the patho- gnomist, the key issue is that certain things the ob- server is not looking for (environmental influ- ences, disease, custom, dress) &gt;may conceal or dis- guise those which we are in quest of,&lt;&lt; whereas, for Lavater, it is only a matter of willing to see, of piercing through the ?foreign and contingent&lt; in order to discover &gt;solid and fixed principles.&lt;&lt; Our senses perceive surfaces, and it is precisely the knowledge which we think we acquire by surfaces that leads to errors. Those ?false resemblances&lt;&lt; that Lavater shudders to think about, those 70 F.

Lichtenberg draws an analogy between bodies exposed to the atmos- phere and minerals which retain their primitive shape only so long as they are kept sealed from the air. Upon emergence from a vacuum, the accidents to which they are exposed and the irregularities that result frequently deceive the expert attempt- ing to classify them. In the same manner, the human body represents a middle state between soul and environment, dimly reflecting both our propensities and surrondings73. As a profound student of caricature, Lichtenberg espouses the &gt;grotesque&lt;&lt; way of conceiving an idea of the inside of all surfaces74. Uninterested in the public, motionless, and invariable signs of the body, he approaches the pathos of the intimate and the internal by means of all those disfiguring &gt;fun- guses,&lt;&lt; outcrops, knobs, &gt;Wenns and other Ex- crescences,&lt;&lt; that Lavater believed veiled real character. According to Dufresnoy, such deform- ing &gt;incidents&lt;&lt; are like ?bold strokes&lt;&lt; or &gt;a kind of Minced Meat in Painting&lt;&lt; that begin to lead an illicit life of their own independent of the narra- tive. That the threat to an integral surface by a freakish jumble was perceived identical, whether speaking of physiognomics or art, is made clear in the shared language of outrage against &gt;patch- work.&lt;&lt; All those who consider &gt;an organized body as a piece of chequered work, represent Na- ture as a compositor for the printing press, picking the characters out of different cases&lt;75. Lichtenberg apparently realized that, for those complex ideas intended to capture what has &gt;neither proportions nor color,&lt;&lt; there never are corresponding impressions fully copied from re- semblances. It is impossible to depict a negative, grotesque, false, inconsistent something that is &gt;&gt;out of nature&lt;&lt; except paradoxically76. Lavater, on the contrary, modelled his efforts to get &gt;to the bottom? of a face after the practice of the anatomist who disassembles the human body only to put it back together with complete accuracy or ?fittingly.? The anatomist, who digs deep into physical man, believed that the exterior is only the projection of the interior set out at last without digressions, with nakedness and truth. That this static paradigm of taking apart man piece by piece underlies Lavater's silhouettes is evinced in his search for the precision and perfection that comes only in death. &gt;The dead furnish a new subject for study... Death puts an end to the agitations to which the body is a perpetual prey. It stops and fixes what was before vague and undecided. Every- thing rises or sinks to its level; all the features return to their true relation&lt;&lt;77. The fused and solid shadow of the silhouette or ?skiagram&lt;&lt; is the per- fect analogue for the uniformity of the One not disrupted by the unlike patches and particles of the mottled Many. Similarly, the undivided, clear, and schematic contour drawing dismantles, delimits, and factually diagrams character.

Engraving faithful and therefore the best tool for the physiog- nomist since they represent only a single line of the figure in which one sees &gt;neither motion, nor light, nor color, nor volume, nor features&lt;&lt;78 (fig. 8). According to Dufresnoy, design (disegno), is &gt;only the Out-Lines of the Fables&lt;&lt; to be filled in by the judicious application of &gt;bold metaphors,&lt; or strong glowing colors, and of &gt;tropes and fig- ures,&lt;&lt; or light and shadows79. Lavater wishes to avoid such mosaic &gt;&gt;in-lines&lt;&lt; - enacting animate appearances - in his purely static simulation of a physiognomy. Diligent precision in taking a silhouette hinges upon a high degree of moral earn- estness, an antipathy to any distraction from clar- ity such as individual touches or conspicuous dig- ressions (fig. 9). Again, caricature offers the un- ruly antithesis to the anatomization, by inert line, of an immobilized sitter. It takes a man apart only to put him back together differently (fig. io). The creation of such farcical and non-resembling &gt;&gt;mis- fits&lt;&lt; allows the joints to show.

Thomas McLean, The Body Politic or the March of Intellect, 1836. Lithograph Implicit in Lavater's values is the assumption that just as there is only one form of Beauty so, too, there is only one state of health. Variegated patch- work, whether of body or work of art, is symptomatic of grotesque disease eroding an ideal- ly smooth plane. Diderot appositely comments that a distinction must be drawn between ideal and real man - the latter being merely a composite of deranged molecules. Further, ,il n'y a pas sur toute la surface de la terre un seule homme parfaitement constitue, parfaitement sain. L'espece humaine n'est qu'un amas d'individus plus ou moins contre faits, plus ou moins malades.&lt;&lt; What praise could possibly be extracted from this dismal fact to honor some hypothetical Creator, he inquires? Since, like the caricaturist, Diderot concludes that ,tout est mal&lt; relative to our conception of perfec- tion, God owes his creation an apology82. In this world of shadows, then, where signs are probable or improbable depending on one's angle of vision, conjecture is the most one can achieve. For this task, medicine provides the logical model since its art depends upon the skill of practitioners and is founded on diagnostics, or the ability to 11.

This semiotic pattern of upward and downward reasoning from external effect to internal cause, from the evident to the non-evident, comes to the service of physiognomics in which diagnosis leads to prognosis ?for every possible or probable dis- temper.&lt;&lt; The symptomatics of illness is identical to the physiognomics of the irregular. ,The mien of... disease&lt;&lt; carries spots, wrinkles, blots, patches, that announce the destruction of a &gt;natural,&lt;&lt; luminous, and sound surface. Lavater's pessimism - unlike Diderot's, because dependent upon a God-like perspective - runs deep: &gt;We are but the refuse of past ages... we blush not at our deformity; we behold with indifference our bodies, our features, disfigured by vice&lt;&lt;83. No blemish is more paradigmatic in Lavater's system, however, than the birthmark: that mis- shappen stain &gt;which children bring into the world upon them&lt;&lt; (fig. 12).

These spoiling &gt;&gt;marks of mortality&lt;&lt;, these dim taches bodying forth the devisings of the heart, catch the shape of the imagination's disorderly symptoms unleashed in a fallen world. &gt;&gt;Ce sont encore les faqons de parler recherchees, les figures deplacees &amp; tirdes de loin, qui s'&amp;cartent de la maniere commune &amp; simple de parler, comme les pa- rures affectees s'dloignent de la maniere de s'habiller qui est en usage parmi les honnetes gens.&lt;&lt; Lavater is a nominalist, holding that the plain sign language of external man dleft unuttered and unde- signated no single thing that reaches our sense per- ceptions... [it] straightway names everything the mind perceives.&lt; His compendium of silhouettes and outlines is a prolix enumeration of the shapes of imperfection and thus resembles the natural his- torian's lengthy taxonomies embracing every form of variety85. By contrast, the caricaturist as comic allegorist makes a terse and complex figure out of many dissonant and abbreviated parts. The princi- ple of the coincidence of opposites at work in the grotesque or satiric portrait is that of condensing the life of the mind into one mixed, yet pointed, image86 (fig. 13). Traditionally, allegory, as both an obscure style and a &gt;veiled&lt; genre, gives body to ideas. The late eighteenth-century conception of the grotesque, however, provides a model for a new and senusous type of figured expression, one congruent with the intricacy of the charged Humean idea and affect. It is commonly agreed that Baroque art shows a predilection for emblems and devices. Ripa's at- tempt to contain such concepts as melancholy or thought under one or two rubrics failed since the composite figures were not primary unities but themselves assemblages with multiple connota- tions87. For our purposes, what is significant is that these pieced together and indirect graphic rep- resentations were abstract, purely intellectual, non-expressive, in the sense that they did not con- vey their meaning through the emotions. It is this indication of emotion, rather than its literal em- bodiment, that enlightened artists almost univer- sally found so objectionable. Fuseli criticizes Re- 84 Lavater, Essays, III, i85-i88.

To this abstruse method succeeded, first, the schematization of expression. In the diagraming of internal qualities, Lavater is an heir to Charles LeBrun since, in neither case, are the virtues and vices to be confused with real, nuanced feelings. Lavater turns things into ideas by multiplying ad infinitum the six canonical Cartesian passion, making them correspond to a vastly enlarged group of typified and static features signifying at- titudes of mind. This was replaced, in turn, by the discovery of how to express feelings without the intervention of conceptual patterns, &gt;&gt;naturally,&lt; -..

Engraving that &gt;&gt;dressed&lt; abstract ideas in favor of the direct conjuring of suffering or joy8, (fig. I5). When, at the close of the century, meaning be- came bound up with sensuous appearance, that is, directly tied to the manner in which images were marked out, made accessible through notation alone - although never completely given by it - al- legories finally achieved a concrete reality as a vis- ible inlay of ideas. This rich mosaic of multiplicity in unity was so conceptually and affectively in- tertwisted that it required from the beholder a per- petual detouring towards, or turning from, one meaning or another. Putting the matter before the eyes with intensity involved the use of tropes (trope, conversio) or figures that diverged from themselves because they were &gt;twisted&lt; in order to take on a significance they did not naturally pos- sess. To the viewer fell the task of reconciling these jumps in meaning and &gt;le plaisir de rapprocher les traits de resemblance &amp; de comparaison&lt;&lt;90. The problematics of joining disproportionate things was especially acute, as Fuseli noted, in the embodiment of incorporeal supernatural beings. Allegories, devices, emblems, hieroglyphs, typi- cally dealt with the superior aspects of existence. As image-ideas they constituted a &gt;&gt;real&lt;&lt; language of commonly inaccessible knowledge about mys- terious, hidden, and spiritual entities. Essential to this universal idiom of thought-objects was inter- nal probability. They must possess an inner coher- ence - no matter how grotesque externally - that allowed each person to reconstitute the occult message in his own vernacular9'. In the allegorical presentation of mental or spiritual life, the lack of proportion between the infinite and the finite, God and man, soul and body, idea and expression, all and nothing, elicited the visual juxtaposition of opposites: the most simple with the most composite, the uniform with the altered, the most immense with the tiniest, the perfect with the idiosyncratic, the unmoved with the passionate. Yet even in man, as Algarotti noted, although nature succeeded in achieving per- fection in the species, symmetry and proportion was not always evident in the individual. &gt;&gt;Elle abandonne pour ainsi dire les individues aux causes secondes.

Whereas Homer stood above all others, even Phidias, with respect to the beauty, majesty, and splendor of his conception, the Egyptians used as their starting point &gt;&gt;symbols which are trivial and absurd&lt;&lt;93. Philostratus, in the Life of Apollonius of Tyana, added that the Greek sculptor's brilliant an- thropomorphic demonstration of the invisible and unportrayable by means of something visible and portrayable was far superior to the Egyptian's dis- similar, heterogenous, theriomorphic materializa- tion of spiritual life. Their &gt;&gt;grotesque&lt;? dogs, ibises, stags were fashioned by craftsmen who pro- duced as handiwork only what they have seen, whereas the Greeks conceived the unseen. Thespe- sion, angered by Apollonius' suggestion that it would be more satisfactory to have an imageless cult since the phantasia imagines better than the visual arts represent, argued that the Egyptians did have respect for their deities and therefore created images as &gt;&gt;symbols of a profound inner mean- ing&lt;94. The advantage of the far-fetched hieroglyphic method, taking from here and there in order to forge proximity and collapse distance between op- posites, over that of verisimilar imitation, becomes clear when one realizes &gt;&gt;that things incredible [want] words to express them.? It is a sad truism of painting, according to Dufresnoy, that ?the greatest Beauties cannot always be express'd for want of terms&lt;&lt; since the knowledge of them is &gt;&gt;so abstruse.?&lt; Yoking together by violence unallied beings makes a new hybrid thought that transports the observer into the foreign, much like the exagg- erated &gt;&gt;discordia? of the Egyptians' monstrous figures permit him to range beyond the limits set by nature into another world"95. Paradoxically, the manifestation of an idea in a distinct, non-discur- sive, image whose components are fragments arti- ficially joined and, therefore, idols without exis- tence, makes something out of nothing. Further, since the Egyptians did not attempt to create a like- ness of an inscrutable and distant divinity, but only an arbitary physical symbol, they avoided per- sonification. The difficulty of embodying divine substance induced Fuseli to ask whether the ?Sup- reme Being should ever have been approached by the feeble efforts of human conception,?&lt; since no single standard of representation was established and painters and sculptors &gt;&gt;widely differed among themselves in the conception of divine or sainted form&lt;&lt;96. Implicit in this realization is the admission that ?portraits? of God are not more perfect than strange combinations of human and animal parts because both are equally of the artist's making. The difference, it seems, hinges on the fact that, with hieroglyphics, figures have been deflected from their &gt;&gt;plain&lt;&lt; meaning and must be divined whereas, with mimetic similitudes, it is, as F6libien comments, as if we were conversing with people we know, whose language we readily understand. This pressure exerted by allegory on the beholder to conjecture or hypothesize about what the painter does not directly express - analogous to the actor's supposition concerning what the author does not state - makes tangibly evident the diffi- culty inherent in presenting an unseen God97. The problem is identical in the domain of ideas: only by the spectator's enacting the exertion of paint- ing, or fitting together, a thought is palpable in- sight gained into the skill required for its creation. 93 Dio Chrysostom, Olympic Discourse, 59, 63. 94 Philostratus, The Life of Apollonius of Tyana, II, trans. by F.

The communi- cation of the unseen, then, is accomplished not by imitation of what is most precious or rare but by material symbolization of what is most antithetical or contradictory to the superior nature of the deity or the idea. The drawback to articulating ingenious and abstract thoughts in a ?language absolument spirituel,&lt;&lt; says Watelet, is that the vulgar or uncul- tivated, bereft of erudition and imagination, see in allegorical figures flying through the air only the comic spectacle of men and women behaving con- trary to nature. These ignorant spectators are ill disposed towards &gt;&gt;l'invrai-semblance&lt;&lt; and deem such efforts ridiculous99. The common-sense hos- tility towards the enigma and rebus-idea contri- buted to travestying the deepest wisdom by dres- sing it in shreds and patches derived from that mundane life near, and known by, the lowly ob- server. In the comprehension of mysterious and ineffable matters the homme d'esprit and the ordi- nary man meet on common ground: on the level, in the milieu. The prismatic model operating in the allegoriza- tion of &gt;invisible, physic, and metaphysic ideas? is alluded to by Fuseli. Simultaneously general and particular, this mode breaks the fetters of time; &gt;it unites with boundless sway mythologic, feodal, local incongruities, fleeting modes of society and fugitive fashions.&lt;&lt; Or, again, Dandr6-Bardon stresses the ability of this &gt;composition mixte? to piece together recondite emblems with ?le vrai his- torique.?&lt; Shattering a classic whole, much like Homer's mingled varieties of dialects, produces a neological object of perception by mixing parts to- gether &gt;much more thoroughly than dyers do their colours&lt;&lt;oo The shadowy fantasmagoria projected by a magic lantern jumbles, as in a vast mirror, a host of frag- mentary moving figures that change perpetually. This ghostly parade, momentarily captured, suggests an animated hieroglyph surrounded by a brilliant cartouche (fig. 16). The imperfect and dream-like illusion, in which the presence of the projector is signalled to the spectator by the halo and the illuminated screen, is the visual counter- part to the microcosmic universe of the distinct and self-contained idea whose multiple light and dark components fitfully assemble and undo themselves before one's eyes. The optical analogue for a complex cognitive process pivots on the pain- terly example of trompe l'ceil. Magic mirrors"', traditionally, were devices that deceived the eye by making physically and temporally distant phenomena, hidden knowledge, visible to the be- holder. These dissembling reflections are a kind of double talk in which their author addresses two audiences at once since, like allegories, the image is simultaneously clear and obscure depending on the perspective. As F6libien states of those arab- esques and grotesques of sea monsters, flowers, fruits, &gt;&amp; mille autres sortes des choses,&lt;&lt; painted by Giovanni de Udine in the trompe l'ceil man- ner - following the stylistic decorum believed ap- propriate to ornament - &gt;&gt;elles semblent vrayes.&lt;&lt; In the latter instance, involving the diverting deco- ration of the Vatican Loggias, or in Giulio Romano's burlesque Room of the Giants at the Palazzo del TA, the effect depends upon the intact- ness of the fiction. Similarly, as Richard Hurd notes of Spenser, Tasso, and Ariosto: in the &gt;faery way of writing,?&lt; the poet &gt;has a world of his own, 98 Otto Demus, Byzantine Mosaic Decoration.

The seamlessness of the trompe l'ceil joke (scherzo) or the coherent marvellous is to be con- trasted both with the magic lantern's phantasms - bordered by ragged edges - and with anamor- phoses. During the sixteenth and seventeenth cen- turies, these perspective paintings frequently were connected to religious art and to those foreign sub- jects remote from our knowledge that needed to be seen from another direction or in a non-naturalis- tic way. Special wisdom is required to comprehend that the ,exterior&lt;&lt; figure covers another &gt;interior&lt;&lt; one physically and metaphysically different from the first. This insight, or second vision, can be ob- tained either through the use of rectifying mirrors or by an actual displacement, whereby the occult image changes, springs to life. In either case, the viewer must will to recreate the incomprehensibly deformed surface which appears monstrous to the unaided eye'x3. What is significant is that incon- gruent meanings - the near and familiar (a land- scape) and the distant and alien (the head of a saint) - are opaquely inlaid side by side: it is the beholder who must transpose what is contiguous, but blurred, into a coherent vertical reading and thus actually create, by separating, two antithetical levels of reality.

Engraving and sketchiness inevitably accompanying the transmission of anything far off, should be con- trasted with astronomical illustrations in which the remote heavens are brought impeccably close- up ?by the artifice of glasses&lt;&lt; (fig. i7). Again, the awareness that we conjecture the divine ?only from a great distance&lt;&lt; (darkly), although desiring to see it &gt;from close at hand?',4 (clearly), makes concrete the effort required to compose such a re- ality. By demonstrating that ontological gulf through surface confusion and incongruity, the ar- tist forces each viewer to fashion a subjective and colored idea of what otherwise would remain un- perceived or merely schematic. Visibilizing divinity or any unseen thing, there- fore, is a combinatory and interpretive act of the imagination. We dream all purely made up or un- natural beings, ?realizing,&lt;&lt; as it were, such hierog- lyphic imaginings as the sphinx, siren, faun, minotaur, ideal man. God shares with the arab- esque or grotesque the fact that he, too, is an artifi- cial aggregate or conception: *on ne peut leur trouver de modeles vrai-semblables que dans les chimeres produites par le sommeil. Les arabesques peuvent donc &amp;tre appellks les raves de la pein- ture&lt;&lt; os. * *Mis-shapen shadows... make objects unintelligi- ble.&lt;&lt; George Levitine, in a group of masterful articles, examined the emblematic sources of Goya's Los Caprichos, and numerous scholars before and since attempted to unravel their factual and fictiti- ous themes""6. My purpose, on the other hand, is to uncover the techniques he creates for presenting the invisible. The search for these, I have been ar- guing, are part of a broadly-based eighteenth-cen- tury concern rooted in contemporary art theory, philosophy, physiognomics, and medicine, for giving shape to the unseen and picturing all that lies elsewhere. The Caprichos' history is well known and re- quires only brief mention. They were issued as a paper-bound album of eighty aquatints on January 17, I799. No title page or explanation accom- panied them, only terse, pungent inscriptions. The first print is a profile self-portrait, followed by di- verting scherzi, images of everyday life on the paseo, or in the brothels, salons, and prisons of Madrid. The second ,chapter&lt;&lt; of this illustrated journal begins with the famous Capricho 43 (fig. 18), showing the artist asleep at his work table'07. The ensuing prints are fragments of that Horatian universal language of monsters and grotesques, 104 Power, Experimental Philosophy, preface.

Aquatint bits of witchcraft, sorcery, and suenios pointedly pieced together. The announcement, published on February 2, 1799, in the Diario de Madrid, assured the public that Goya had no intention of satirizing any specific individual. Rather, &gt;painting (like poetry) selects from the universal that which it deems most fitting to its ends; unites in a single fantastic person, circumstances and characters which nature presents distributed among many; and from this ingeniously arranged composition springs that fortunate imitation through which a good craftsman wins the title of inventor rather than slavish copyist,*?o8. The use of a twilight setting in the Caprichos, especially evident in the scene of the quiet dreamer, introduces the viewer into a shadowy, foreign, and disorderly inscape that reverses, by paroxysm, the classical rules for chiaroscuro. The monstrous does not consist in Capricho 43 - as it does in others - of physically deformed or hybrid creatures, since only barnyard bats, owls, and a cat surround the artist. The visual evidence for the non-commensurability between the noctural scene and a &gt;natural&lt; world derives instead, from the &gt;chimerical&lt; and &gt;many improper parts of light and shade&lt;&lt; that fitfully bring into being a dream-object.

Aquatint an intermittent distemper, one that can return after an interval, appears to be what Goya had in mind when he wrote on a preliminary sepia study: ?Uni- versal language. Imagination abandoned by reason produces impossible monsters: united with her, she is the mother of the arts and the source of their wonders&lt;&lt;"". He configures dissonance by giving shape to the jarring intrusion of the fit - suddenly flying in - or to the lapse out of, or flight from, reason. This is not achieved mimetically by por- traying the passions since, according to the venera- ble example of Timanthes, the immobile sleeper's face remains concealed (also see figs. 19 and 22). Instead, Goya emphatically alternates disruptive bursts of light with patches of shade to de- monstrate the erratic and short gaps existing be- tween waking and dreaming, reason and unreason. That this strategy of atomistic notation, using idiosyncratic signa, is peculiarly suited to a capri- cious dream metaphysics is made clear by Diderot. In a dream or a fever, the imperceptible chain of images that stock the memory become unlinked, ideas lose their connections, and come to resemble the ?sons purs d'une langue inconnue.&lt;&lt; Diderot contrasts the persistent dream of madness (the rAve suivi) with the daily troubling of the flow of sensa- tions caused by routine intervals of waking and sleeping. &gt;Le passage de la veille au sommeil est toujours un petit delire.&lt; The audible effect of a suddenly disjointed succession of images, sounds, tastes, is one of different people conversing loudly on various topics at the same time. These synesthe- tic apparitions, that is, single ideas or phantasms of configured light alienated from a coherent con- tinuum and ,appearing&lt; in isolation when we are distracted, seem closer at hand and more intense than do impressions noiselessly streaming in while we are awake. Such flickering ideas, or chiaroscuro phantasms, freed from a logical train of thought, are compared to assertive musical intervals that embody pleasure or pain. The staccato perceptual jumps, elicited by distinctive units of vivid and piquant sensation, are like those abrupt visual de- tours instigated by the bizarre jumble of gro- tesques. Watelet employs the same clamorous analogy as Diderot. ,C'est i cefracas de signes &amp; d'images que Petrone compare les orn6mens re- mplis d'une multitude de petites figures in- sipides... on aura donn6 le nom de compendiaria " ce genre, i cause de la multiplicit6 &amp; de la diversit6 des choses entassbes dans un espace resserr6 et r6- duites en abrge"'II. I? Quoted in Ilie, Teratology, 44. In recent years, it has be- come increasingly apparent that not only was Goya a well-read artist, but that he was influenced by French and English art and theory.

To my knowledge, however, no one has connected Goya's &gt;caricatures,&lt;&lt; &gt;moral poems,&lt;&lt; &gt;emblems&lt;&lt; or depictions of the ?extravagances and er- rors which are common to the whole of society,&lt;&lt; to the larger theoretical debate on the improper uses of chiaroscuro and the illicit flaunting of original, or ob- trusively made-up, ideas.

Francisco de Goya, &gt;Bad Night,&lt; Capricho 36, 1799. Aquatint Unvarnished and shrill &gt;&gt;glare&lt;&lt; (evident through- out the Caprichos - see figs. 19, 20, 21, 22), is, ac- cording to Fuseli, the mark of a savage or infant taste. Egyptian hieroglyphics and barbarous Gothic illuminations made use of &gt;&gt;a surface un- broken by [nuanced] tint nor relieved by [gra- dated] shade.&lt;&lt; Both optically and cognitively &gt;&gt;wounding,&lt; these &gt;&gt;hits&lt; of light and dark are comparable to salient epigrams. Whereas, for Duf- resnoy or Dandr&amp;-Bardon, such felicitous strikes and &gt;&gt;points&lt;&lt; are the result of chance - ,faintly touched&lt; and &gt;&gt;almost passed over in silence&lt;&lt; - Goya's conspicuous and deviant ,luminous echoes&lt;&lt; bounce as the result of controlled impreci- sion. The manipulation of irrational light violates the neoclassical dictum that there must be a princi- pal shaft, following a diagonal trajectory, to which all others are subordinated. According to academic theory, the eye is permitted to travel only along a path paved with a succession of half-tints grouped in straight lines' 12. This rule is modelled after the &gt;&gt;correct&lt;&lt; process for forming ideas, rationally, ad seriatum, in lieu of the imagination's grotesque couplings and random linkages. Goya mocks this mimetic canon (fig. 23) by inverting the law: now a &gt;&gt;ray&lt;&lt; of shadow descends obliquely, ironically highlighting, instead of casting into darkness, the monstrous that otherwise would remain invisible. Since a caprice, by definition, is &gt;&gt;an irregular mo- tion of desire,&lt;&lt; its freakish, wayward, turnabout rovings must be embodied in the graphic medium since it cannot be represented legitimately by a narrative or dramatic subject. Significantly, the opprobrious language used by art theorists to de- plore such whims is identical to that employed for the illicit handling of chiaroscuro. Mercier says &gt;&gt;ces idles fines, sautillantes, enigmatiques, ces ec- lairs qui brillent &amp; qui s'eteignent, ces tours vifs, ingenieux &amp; recherches, ces vices peignes, fleuris, brillantes de toutes les couleurs,&lt; must be avoided at all costs.

This moral indignation at the shattering of a heal- thy skin of paint or an unmottled surface of illu- sion is transposed from the problem of broken unity posed by Newton's destruction of the uni- form ray of light. Algarotti manages to keep in check the danger of multiplicity inherent in pris- matic rupture. He stresses, like other neoclassi- cists, that, although the beam &gt;&gt;est un assemblage ou un petit faisceau de rayons rouges, oranges, jaunes, verts, bleu de ciel, bleu fonce, indigo &amp; vio- lets,&lt; the colors join imperceptibly and thus are in- distinguishable from white light'"4. It is precisely by handling forbidden fractured lights and misshapen darks, straying from the straight line and the regular form, that Goya openly imprints his images with a personal accent while, simultaneously, visibilizing the deviant and unnatural. Similarly, the decorum for determining the correct ,seasoning&lt;&lt; of a work with just enough &gt;salt&lt; to indicate the artist's good taste can also be converted into its opposite, a marring optical metaphor. Extravagance in sprinkling one's bril- liant ,points&lt; ruins the seamless composition and spoils the well-mixed &gt;&gt;ragout&lt;&lt;"'. Aquatint is, par excellence, a mottled technique that encourages freedom and originality by breaking the net of wirey, cross-hatched lines associated with repro- ductive engraving. The latter's rational trellis pat- tern of consistently blended lights and darks avoids an overly piquant glare. Further, like the di- vergent contents of the Caprichos themselves, ab- rupt shifts - whether of lights and darks, flavors, sights, or moods - veer towards the ridiculous and are in poor taste"6 (figs. 20, 24, 25).

Caprices as smatterings of this and that - emotion- ally suggestive but not finally illuminating - repre- sent the ideal genre for getting at partial truths and contemporary uncertainties. They appeal to the alogos aesthesis, or to that faculty of the viewer's mind and heart that can perceive, although it is un- able to apprehend rationally, imprecision and dis- order. Not only are lights and darks morally and physically inverted, but illumination and en- lightenment is everywhere promised and with- held, or suddenly annihilated, by the environing obscurity. This process is paralleled by Goya's habit of making something out of nothing. In Cap- richo 52, &gt;What a Tailor can achiever (fig. 26), a young woman worships a tree draped as a hooded monk. This empty &gt;idol&lt; reminds the viewer that in early religions statues of divinities were often ex arbore. It was left to the craftsman to articulate the anthropomorphic shape lodged within the tree and to make a god"7. This truncated hybrid deity, or dressed-up imposter, belongs to a host of com- pound images manipulated by Goya in order to get at realities that could not otherwise be stated. The scarecrow's ontological nothingness, yet devastat- ing effect, is counterpointed by the schematically etched witches flying behind him. The hidden image becomes one of Goya's prim- ary tools for getting at all those things embedded, yet anamorphically skewed, in the plane of reality and to whose presence we subliminally respond despite their surface blur. The concealed figure, long a device of the political caricaturist or satirist (fig. Io), depends upon the associative possibilities provided by strong contrasts of light and shade, the dialectics of being and non-being. It enables the artist to give voice to a private thought which, for various reasons, must remain absent from pub- lic statement; it gives shape to a sous-entendu con- jecture or feeling and thus literally fashions what is not. The physiognomic potential of a sack is exploited by Goya in Capricho 71, ~When Day ~id~ a ::? ~ L.':S~..T 25. Francisco de Goya, &gt; Until Death,&lt; Capricho 55, 1799.

Aquatint and Etching the looming silhouette of a shadowy demon, deeply bitten, carry greater visual substance than do the ephemeral main characters shown on the verge of disappearing with dawn. The deliberate chance image, hidden to the casual glance, is a painted allusion. As Lacombe com- ments in his Pricis de l'art th~dtrale (i8o8), the term derives from alludere, &gt;&gt;to play.&lt;&lt; Its role, however, is limited in the theater, because the strategem can be linked only rarely to the plot. &gt;&gt;Ce n'est que de la conversation, ce n'est que de l'es- prit, et toute beaut ~6trangere est un ddfaut.&lt;&lt; In comedy, according to the neoclassical critic, some allusions to current fashions, vices in vogue, polit- ical events, are permissible if their points remain inconspicuous and do not disrupt the flow of the dialogue by turning into distinct moralizing sen- tentiae"'. Taking advantage of the atomistic stip- ple effect of the resin and the chance designs result- ing from the striated tones of aquatint washed over burin lines, Goya configures political and religious allusions, inlaying them alongside surface diver- sions. This clandestine technique requires know- ledge foreign to the common audience and, like anamorphoses, demands a displacement to convert the absurd into the credible. Caprichos 13 (fig. 20), 55 (fig. 25), and 74 (fig. 28) aphoristically employ premeditated chance images to allude to the bro- ken knowledge characteristic of modern timesI'o False beliefs, hearsay, snatches of opinion, are the shadowy things of this world with which we are close and familiar.

From man's dim point of view, on the ground, only discrete, disconnected events are immediately evident: small matters, trivia, such as &gt;a legend, a tale, a tradition, a rumour, a supersti- tion&lt;&lt; - in short, the very contents of the Cap- richos'22. The satire on gluttony, &gt;&gt;They are Hot,&lt; depicts ravenous monks. That, because of their ex- cessive wealth and indulgences, they devour not food but mankind (apparent in a preliminary drawing)"23 is obliquely embodied in the final ver- sion. A sketchy white head, staining the belly of the foremost figure - can be discovered by rotating the print ninety degrees to the left. To the en- lightened observer, the idea of rapacity is glaringly presented as cannibalization. oUntil Death&amp; mocks an aging Queen Maria Luisa of Parma, wife of Carlos IV and lover to Manuel Godoy. Not only is a caricature carica- tured by her distorted reflection, but the brilliantly configured and obliterating blot, juxtaposed with the diagrammatic mirror image, embodies the spectral notion of death. This graffiti portent of imminent erasure, the prognosis for timely de- struction of an already skeletal physiognomy, is redoubled in the irregular patch of light that eats away her limbs"24. Such punning on annhilation is not unique. In Capricho 78, ,Be Quick, They are Waking Up,&lt; (fig. 29), gobelins are shown scour- ing and sweeping a kitchen. The activity of clearing away, or emptying of debris, is punningly indi- cated by Goya's manual skill in burnishing the path voided by the broom'25. ,Don't Scream, Stupid&lt; (fig. 28) contains a face hidden in the trian- gular shadow-skirt of the male hobgobelin. Just as the coarsely etched lines do double duty - creating a hybrid couple by sharing two figures at once - so, too, the concealed head, analogous to a trope, as- sumes dual and divergent physiognomies depend- ing on whether the print is turned to the left or right. That these obliterated or ,veiled? blurs and flaws, requiring visibilization, are intentional signs is made evident by Capricho 23 (fig. 21), ,That Dust&lt;&lt;"6.

Aquatint and Etching emerges not only a neological grotesque profile but a new, and higher, unity. By this flaring illumi- nation of a contemporary, yet apparitional, event Goya gives shape to the common culpability and plight of man. The Caprichos, then, are a universal language enabling the artist to speak covertly to all the world. Unlike Piranesi's Carceri, G. B. Tiepolo's Varij Capricci, or even Salvator Rosa's ?medley of shreds and bits,? however, this extravagant mix- ture permits Goya to seize not only whimsical no- tions but to brood upon imponderables dressed in fantastic disguise. His bias17 - evident in the sub- liminal or ,invisible&lt; imagery - turns the antic license of earlier ,fancy pictures&lt; into a mordant satire on duplicity. This new and modern universal character, unhindered by classical rules of de- corum, stands at the antipodes from the noble and sacred art of Renaissance and Baroque allegories fashioned from lofty emblems. Composed of grotesque conjunctions or, as Fuseli would say, of ,trash and caprice,&lt; a ?heterogeneous stock&lt; aris- ing from ,materials so unfit and contaminated, and defective,&lt;&lt; Goya's ideas convey directly the un- ideal substance of fragmented reality. In short, they picture the very &gt;forces of barbarity"&lt;,8. The miniaturization of evil in the Caprichos as ?par- cels&lt;&lt; of opinion, small misdemeanors, scatalogical little &gt;&gt;figures to let&lt;&lt; (figs. I8, 23, 3o), extends beyond the convention of bizarries and scherzi, that is, those contained or delimited fantastical aberrations interjected into an otherwise orderly universe"29 (fig. 3 ). Whether presenting the idea 127 Fuseli, Lectures, 75-76. &gt;&gt;Bias&lt;&lt;, according to Johnson's Dictionary, i 17, is &gt;&gt;any thing which turns a man to a particular course.&lt; The verb means &gt;&gt;to incline to some side; to balance one way; to prejudice.&lt; Z28 Fuseli, Lectures, 52, 58. 129 For dreams and imaginations as having been seen before &gt;&gt;either totally, or by parcells in the Sense,&lt;&lt; see Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan, intro. by A.

Engraving of the bondage of marriage (&gt;Is there no one to untie us?c) or of cocky men in thrall to harpies (,All Will Fall,), these hybrid images configure the unwholesome and pervasive breaks in ?natural(( relations, the shattering of a higher unity that comes with focussing on the dissonant trifles of existence'3?. Again, it is by means of diversions away from acceptable standards of handling lights and darks that the perverse is made to appear. As unity is indispensable to legitimate chiaros- curo - defined as triangular, incorporeal shafts emanating from on high and ?sliding,&lt;&lt; ?diminish- ing,&lt;&lt;( reflecting&lt;&lt; as they silently steal over ob- jects - so all ,lesser&lt; lights necessarily float bet- ween two poles. In this system, shade is mere ab- sence of light'3. &gt;&gt;Double lights,&lt; competing with the principal illumination, or worse, ,many small lights,&lt;&lt; refusing to &gt;s'enchainer pour ne former qu'un seul tissu,&lt; produce the barbarous &gt;party- colour'd&lt;&lt; mosaic or &gt;le papillotage&lt;&lt;'32. Instead of framing a coalition of opposites by imperceptible degrees, this &gt;&gt;obsence and impudent&lt; procedure, according to Dufresnoy, corrupts natural forms by a &gt;&gt;confusion of their Parts which are entangled in each other,? thus turning the unison of the whole into shocking objects ,full of hollows, bro- ken into little pieces&lt; 33. The evil of ,simplex color,&lt; that is, of traducing classical tradition by using inlays which leave each tint unmixed and standing crudely by itself (equally transferable to glaring chiaroscuro)'34 is identical to the devil's work.

'34 In classical theory from the Renaissance onward light in a painting is absent or present always as the result of handling color; therefore, there is no opposition be- tween the language of color and that of chiaroscuro.

The concrete presentation of a world of shadow, of contingent and changeable things, proves that darkness is more than mere privation or nothing. Further, it is in the nature of this wayward and flitting style to elicit a feeling of uncertainty. Reynolds warns that the want of repose arising from a profusion of objects or a variety and bright- ness of color causes &gt;&gt;anxiety.&lt;&lt; An &gt;&gt;ecclectic&lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt;loose, unideal disperion&lt;&lt; permits the observer to see only with difficulty, dimly, doubting what he observes'37. He becomes aware how light and dark shapes mutually struggle with each other in the graphic process of becoming visible and thus the unseen condition of seeing is materially incorpo- rated into the blurred and near incoherent subject of the prints'38. Having violated the classical unities, Goya in- vents a new &gt;&gt;impromptu&lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt;exursive?&lt; composi- tional order. As Remond de Sainte-Albine notes of the Commedia dell'arte, what is lost in the seam- less elegance of a memorized written dialogue is gained in the vivid conversational or sketchy effect produced by &gt;&gt;des choses moins bien dites&lt;&lt;39. The seemingly accidental or unsystematic arrangement of the album leaves betrays an inner logic grounded on the subjects' footing in popular be- liefs from which they derive affective force. There are three major pictorial clusters around the topics of prostitution, animal fables, and dreams or sor- cery'40. Fashioning his own style or rhetoric, Goya thematically and visually intertwists these topics in various ways'41. Avoiding the undemanding se- quential unfolding appropriate to the representa- tion of a neoclassical narrative or drama, he ab- ruptly juxtaposes the three groups. Moreover, he interrupts any storyline by dispersing the gro- tesque characters in a kind of papillotage through- out the series to give the eighty scenes the semblance of total coordination'42. The only unity is that of an autonomous and assertive design, the particolored or motley inlay which the viewer must toil to stitch together. Goya remakes by means of a coherent fiction the diseased world of contemporary Spain. The Caprichos thus present a pictorial memoir portraying his scattered thoughts on the nature of that motley and blemished life which, without art, would remain unseen, lost below the distorted surface of historical incident. The prismatic system of &gt;&gt;fits&lt;&lt; of light and shade is central to a style based on unpredictability; it complements a hypothetical or irregular form of reasoning from experience. Leafing through the album is like looking at a magic lantern show; one cannot say in advance what shape the composition will take or forecast the succeeding images. They appear to be the result of chance and, by their infi- nite variety, hold the viewer in a constant state of engaged expectancy. The Caprichos lack of ready- made syntheses, achieved through the randomiza- tion of chiaroscuro and the break up of a uniform painterly surface, links Goya to the modern con- ception of the work of art as multiple, a sequence 136 Fuseli, Lectures, 81. 137 Reynolds, Discourses, 147; Fuseli, Lectures, xiv; Webb, Inquiry, 138. 138 Fanchon Fr6hlich, &gt;The Locations of Light in Art: From Rembrandt to Op Art and Light Environment,&lt;&lt; British Journal of Aesthetics, XI, Winter 1971, 49-52. 139 Remond de Sainte-Albine, Le Comedien, 182-183. Contrast to Reynolds, Discourses, 164: &gt;... leaving any- thing to the imagination, opposes a very fixed and indis- pensable rule in our art, that everything shall be care- fully and distinctly expressed, as if the painter knew, with correctness and precision, the exact form and character of whatever is introduced into the picture.&lt;&lt; 140 Schoch, Der Schlaf der Vernunft, 26.

This method of design that takes note of effect and required the eye to work from the effect of individual parts to an idea of structure also operates in eighteenth-century architec- ture: see David Cast, &gt;Seeing Vanbrugh and Hawksmoor,&lt; Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, XLIII, December 1984, 314. 362</page><page sequence="35">of rapidly succeeding novel and diverting images that must be forcibly jointed together'43. Framing a neological thought-entity belongs to those rhetorical effects deliberately produced by skill. The license to make something new, to give existential status to the non-existent, has tangible repercussions within the topography of the uni- verse. When artistic creation ex nihilo, rather than imitation, becomes a reality the phenomenal world can no longer be considered a plenum without &gt;so much a hair's breadth of empty space&lt;&lt;44. To come full circle, it is this realization that underlies the second of two preparatory drawings (Prado, no. 34) for Capricho 43, in which the human and ani- mal forms that seem to emerge from the artist's head in the first study (no. 470) are replaced by a large blank area'45. Not only does the mind need room to &gt;vacate to other and contrary ideas,',46as Shaftesbury said, but the fiction-producing role of the imagination involves the concept of supple- ment, of supplying artifically what nature does not. The concomitant corporealization of the im- agination implies the construction of another world, the possibility for counterfeiting the ab- sent. In this feigned inscape, &gt;wide-ranging&lt;&lt; ideas are real since they, like external objects, produce effects, give rise to actual alterations and metamorphoses in mundane affairs'47. As long as the human spirit is tossed by passions because it in- habits, as Origen observed, &gt;the thick of things,&lt;&lt;48 its waywardness can be externalized only as extravagant excursions and rough mixtures of wandering lights and shades'49. In charting the irregular trajectory of errant thought Goya overthrows Lavater's neoclassical axiom that, just as the human body has lines which bound it, &gt;every mind has its peculiar sphere in which to range; but that sphere is invariably deter- mined',50. The traumatic adventure of tenebrous ideas'5' set loose in the void, fitfully hunting their way in the dark, is embodied in the blurred ordi- nary language of staining blots and flickering points characteristic of the medium. Goya's aqua- tints visibilize the spotted opacity of the world. '43 Emmanuel Pernoud, &gt;Baudelaire, Guys et le kaleido- scope,&lt;&lt; Gazette des Beaux-Arts, CIV, September 1984, 75. This difference between an unobtrusive and an ob- trusive method of &gt;fitting together&lt;&lt; the parts of a work of art is crucial to the difference between a classic and a romantic rhetoric.

The shift is one from the religious belief that spirits &gt;&gt;cause a true metamorphosis,&lt;&lt; just as Nebuchadnezar really turned into a beast and Lot's wife truly turned into a pillar of salt, to the secular notion of artificial manufacture, or that there &gt;&gt;are few things, that are uncapable of being represented by a Fiction&lt;&lt;.
