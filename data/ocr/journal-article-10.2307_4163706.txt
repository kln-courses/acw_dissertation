<plain_text><page sequence="1">LAST OF THE CURLEWS. By Fred Bodsworth. Counterpoint, Washington D.C. 1995. $15 (cloth).-This little book of less than a hundred pages has become a conservation classic since it was published in 1955 by Dodd, Mead &amp; Company. This edition has been expanded by including a Forward by Pulitzer Prize-winning poet and conservationist W.S. Mervin, a brief Epilogue by Bodsworth, and a 45 page Afterword by Nobel Prize-winning particle physicist Murray Gell-Mann. Gell-Mann's Afterward begins with the question: "Can the human race learn, while there is still time, how to coexist with the great diversity of bird life on this planet?" In the pages which follow, he examines the question of extinction in the context of geologic time and past periods of catastrophic extinction of species and then focuses on the changes to the biosphere which humans have produced in the past few centuries and the enormous stress we continue to put on the ecological systems of the planet. He eventually enters an arena which is perhaps best described as philosophical or political with a discussion of quality of human life versus quantity, at one point asking: "Why squander quality of life for the sake of mere numbers of humans?" In a world already overcrowded with humans, this is perhaps the most fundamental question one could ask.</page><page sequence="2">394 THE WILSON BULLETIN * Vol. 108, No. 2, June 1996 The book itself contains 11 chapters which comprise a biographical sketch of the hypo- thetical "last of the curlews," an Eskimo Curlew (Numenius borealis). It is a touching story told by a biologist with a deep understanding of shorebird biology. The skillful avoidance of anthropomorphism is quite remarkable, as is the author's use of language to evoke an emotional response from the reader. The chapters are separated by short sections entitled "The Gantlet" [gauntlet] which consist of vignettes quoted from published historical doc- uments which delineate the slaughter of Eskimo Curlews by man and the virtual disap- pearance of the species. This classic story of human exploitation and extinction, together with the penetrating analysis of global problems by Gell-Mann, are well worth reading and discussing, particu- larly in times of political and economic change.-WILLIAM E. DAVIS, JR.</page></plain_text>
