Macmillan and Co., Ltd. 1918. ?1 17s. 6a7. net. Personally it gives me great pleasure to find the folklore in the Old Testament systematically examined, and still greater pleasure to find that the examiner is Sir James Frazer. lie has, indeed, given us here three volumes of some 1,700 pages, crammed, as one might have expected, with valuable facts and illuminating comparisons, and with suggestions enough to keep the thoughtful thinking for a long while. His work does not, however, pretend to be a complete encyclopaedia of the folklore to be found in the Old Testament. In fact, such very important points as " the sacrifice of the firstborn, the law of the uncleanness of women, and the custom of the scapegoat " have been deliberately left out of his present purview, because Sir James has already dealt with them elsewhere. His plan in this book is his well-known one of taking up certain definite problems and proceeding to investigate them by the comparative method in great detail, some times making suggestions as to the true selection from the resulting deductions, and sometimes leaving the problems open for the reader to draw his own conclusions. Perhaps, as there is still so much left out, the work, as in previous cases, will be much expanded at some future time. Let us hope so. Although uncompromising in his statement of the evidence of the survivals of savagery locked up in the phraseology and statements of the Old Testament, Sir James has unbounded admiration for the " higher JRAS. 1919. 5</page><page sequence="2">06 notices of fcooks side of the Hebrew genius which has manifested itself in a spiritual religion and a pure morality, and of which the Old Testament is the imperishable monument". An admiration which leads him to ask: " in what other volume shall we find, side by side with that melancholy record [the annals of savagery and superstition], psalmists who poured forth their sweet and solemn strains of meditative piety in the solitude of the hills or in the green pastures and beside still waters ; prophets who lit up their beatific visions of a blissful future with the glow of an impassioned imagination; historians who bequeathed to distant ages the scenes of a remote past embalmed for ever in the amber of a pellucid style ?" Without in any way wishing to detract from the glories of the brighter side of the Old Testament records or to belittle the splendour of the translations into our own language, I would suggest to Sir James that if he were to apply his comparative method to the sacred literature of other Semitic races and of other Indo-European races as developed in the East, he would find that much of what is quoted above can be said of other volumes". There is a reason why the Vedic hymns, the Pahlavi yathas, the Pali texts, and those of the Quran have had and still have such a hold on the people who believe in them ; and that reason may be expressed very much in the terms used by Sir James of the Old Testament. Years ago I knew a fine old Muhammadan Sirdar in the Punjab, who made a point of calling on me periodically to explain that if I would only digest his selections from his sacred writers I could not fail to perceive the superiority of the Muhammadan moral teachings over the Christian, I knew later on a Burmese Sayfulaw, head of a monastery, who explained that it was useless to try and convert Buddhists to Christianity as the Christians had no new moral lesson to teach the Buddhists. I have heard highly educated Hindus say the same thing, and Parsees who were puzzled at the</page><page sequence="3">FOLKLORE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT ()7 Christian assumption of a superior inoral teaching. There must be a reason for all this, and it seems to be that in all high civilization religious ritual is leavened bv folklore and religious philosophy by a high morality. The two go side by side and together are a phenomenon of a stage or stages of human mental culture, though each has usually a separate historical development. Hence, each can be studied by itself, and the study of the folklore in a faith need not encroach on that of its philosophy. The study of both is essential to the proper understanding &lt;&gt;! the mental attitude at any given period of the people holding the faith, and the comparative method is in both cases " the instrument for the detection of savagery under civilization ". Hence the value of volumes such as these under notice. The first problem that Sir James tackles is the Old Testament story of the Creation of Man, very properly pointing out that the first and second chapters of Genesis are incompatible, and contain, in fact, a record of two separate accounts that had been handed down in Hebrew tradition. One of these stories is much older than the other; the older being "folklore" and the newer a priestly version of the folklore, a modification of it adapted to current ideas of propriety. Cod the Creator in the older version is highly anthropomorphic, much more so than in the newer: and it may be pointed out here that we have lately had much evidence during the great European war that the Jehovistic, i.e. highly anthropomorphic, view of God has by no means even now died out among Christians of superior civilization. With many the conception of Cod is as full of "folklore" as ever. After going into cosmogonie tales from all parts of tin; world and during all times known to us, Sir James suggests no solution, perhaps wisely. We are all mentally the product of our forbears and environment, and as full</page><page sequence="4">(58 NOTICES OE BOOKS of prejudices as ever they were, so it is safest to leave the question open. The position is summed,up thus: "The foregoing examples may serve to illustrate two very different views which primitive man has taken of his own origin. They may be distinguished as the theory of creation and the theory of evolution. According to the one the human race was fashioned in its present form by a great artificer, whether a god or a hero; according to the other, it was evolved by a natural process out of lower forms of animal or even vegetable life. Roughly speaking, these two theories still divide the civilized world between them. The partisans of each can appeal in support of their view to a large consensus of opinion ; and if truth were to bo decided by weighing the one consensus against the other, with Genesis in one scale and The Origin of Sjwcies in the other, it might perhaps be found, when the scales were finally trimmed, that the balance hung very even between creation and evolution." In the existing conditions of belief and argument it is perhaps best to follow Sir James in his wisdom, and leave this tremendous question where he has left it. The next great question tackled is the Fall of Man. Sir James has grappled with this matter in a manner that frankly rouses my admiration. He writes of the Biblical story: "We may suppose that in the original form of the narrative there were two trees, a Tree of Life ami a- Tree of Death, and that man was allowed to eat of the Tree of Life, but forbidden to eat of the Tree of Death." And that probably the intention of the Creator was "to confer immortality on His creature,man, and was only frustrated in His amiable intention by the cunning of the serpent. In the original narrative the serpents motive for beguiling the woman was probably to cheat men of the boon of immortality and confer it on the serpents, which are commonly supposed to be immortal, because they cast their skins and thereby renew their</page><page sequence="5">FOLKLORE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 09 youth ". Finally, Sir James regards " the story of the Fall of Man in its original form as an explanation of the origin of death ". All this sets him exploring folktales gathered round immortality and death and the serpent, which he collects under the Story of the Perverted Message to account for the origin of death?the belief " that God at one time purposed to make mankind immortal, but that the benevolent scheme miscarried through no fault of the messenger to whom He entrusted the gospel message ". He then goes on to the Story of the Cast Skin to account for immortality, especially of the serpent, and thirdly to a composite story of both the foregoing ideas. Thus the Story of the Fall of Man arose out of "savage" attempts to explain the phenomenon of death and the belief in immortality. The author then passes on to the Mark of Cain. Whatever it was, he discards the solution that it was a tribal mark, tattooed and other, and shows by analogy that it was to protect the murderer in his wanderings from the scene of the spilt blood which " polluteth the land: and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it". In his conclusion on this point Sir James points out in a fine passage how the superstitions which caused the fear of uncovered blood shown in the Biblical narrative of the murder of Abel " may have served a useful purpose in the evolution of morality by rein forcing the sanctity of human life". The bulk of the first volume is taken up with an examination of the Story of the Great Flood. Sir James goes into the almost universal stories of a deluoe at great length, and seems to arrive at what appears to me to be a sensible conclusion, that there is "no reason to think that any diluvial tradition is older than a few thousand years", and that such as exist are due to recollections of some terrible local calamity, or "are not legendary but</page><page sequence="6">70 NOTICES OF ROOKS purely mythical : they describe catastrophes that never occurred. They are examples of that class of mythical tales which, with Sir Edward Tylor, we may call myths of observation, since they are suggested by a true observa tion of nature, but are incorrect in their interpretation of it \ e.g. the observation of marine fossils found on mountains or in other places remote from the sea. The Hebrew story is derived from a Babylonian or rather Sumerian source, and cannot be the origin of all the great flood stories of the world. It is very pleasing to find in going over the ninny tales quoted b}r Sir James Frazer, (hat he is quite wide awake to the danger of mistaking a missionary's description of the Biblical narrative dished up in "native" form for a genuine folktale. We are tlfen taken to the Tower of Babel and the many attempts to account for and find out tho origin of the diversity of tongues, which in this case do not predicate much intelligence of observation on the part of "the folk". With this subject Sir James leaves the early ages of the world or general history according to the ancient Hebrews, and passes to the particular legends of their own race. He is hardly less interesting here, commencing with the Covenant of Abraham and its bearing on the ratification of agreements, and going oh to the heirship of Jacob and the very wide subject of ultimogeniture and its causes, including the supposititious Jus Prim Noctis, which is carefully explained and gone into. The heirship of Jacob as the youngest son involves, in the story of the kid-skins and the deception of his father (which is explained as arising out of scholastic necessity in interpret a fact in entire divergence from the current custom of primogeniture), a reminiscence of the legal fiction of a new birth on changing social status, through a ritual in which sacrificial skins formed a part. Jacob is the subject of much folk-legend?his dream, the heavenly ladder and the sacred stone; his meeting</page><page sequence="7">FOLKLORE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 71 with Rachel at the well and the Jewish custom of the watering of the flocks; and his bursting into tears on kissing Kachel there, alluding to the widespread custom, well known to Sir James and incidentally to the present writer, of weeping as a salutation. His marriage to two sisters, who were his cross-cousins, gives rise to a most interesting series of age-wide and world-wide inquiries into many connected customs, leading to the valuable conclusion " that marriages like that of Jacob have been and still are practised in many d i fi?rent parts of the, world. In marrying his cross-cousins, the daughters of his mother's brother, in wedding the elder sister before the younger, and in serving his father-in-law for a term of years for each of his wives, the patriarch conformed to customs which are fully recognized and strictly observed by many races", affirming that "the portraiture of manners in Jacob's biography is no mere fancy picture, but drawn from the life". The story of Jacob and the mandrakes alludes to the very widely-spread nostrum for procuring sons by eating fruit, among many other methods, and it is interesting to find Rachel and Leah fully acquainted with it, though Sir James does not bring out this side of the story. Tho Covenant of the Cairn leads Sir James, after an amusing account of Jacob's flight with his wives and his father-in law's goods, to expatiate on the setting up of a cairn to mark their ultimate reconciliation, on the principle of sympathetic magic?the stones giving stability to the contract?still in practice in Syria. Jacobs all-night wrestle with the angel at the ford of the Jabbok is explained as a reminiscence of a story of a struggle with the river god or spirit till the break of day, a common form of folktale and source of custom. The stories of the Patriarchs are wound up by that of Joseph's divining cup hidden in Benjamin's sack, and to the folklore connected with such cups.</page><page sequence="8">72 NOTICES OF BOOKS Passing on to the later times of the Judges and the Kings we arrive at the national history of Israel, with (he great figure of Moses, a copious source of legend and story. It begins with his exposure in the ark of bulrushes, which leads Sir James to remark that this is true folklore, with many parallels in the legends of striking personalities of old time, perhaps due to a r?miniscence of a water ordeal to test legitimacy. The story of the Passage through the Red Sea is illustrated by similar exploits of Alexander the Great and Scipio the Younger at Carthage, which have a natural and a legendary aspect. Of the Waters of Meribah Sir James has not much to say, though he quotes a parallel from the Celebes. Let us hope as time goes on that he may collect more. Passing by the chapters on the story of Gideon's men, whom he selected by their mode of drinking water, and Jotham's Fable of the Trees, which both show the acuteness of Sir James Frazer's eye for folktale parallels, we conic to the important legend of Samson and Delilah and the widespread belief in the virtue that lies in the hair. The story of David and Abigail yields a rich chapter on the Bundle of Life (" the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God ") and the worldwide belief in the External Soul. Then comes the pathetic visit of Saul in perplexity and apprehension to the Witch of Endor, the ghost-secr, and the old-world, and for that matter new-world, belief in spirit medicines, followed by Davids sin in taking a census of his people, which is referred to sheer super stition equally widespread. But may it not have some reference to the almost universal Eastern idea of the Evil Eye punishing pride of possession ? In the legend of Solomon and the Queen of Shcba, any one versed in Eastern legend and story will be reminded of many old acquaintances in her riddles, and no doubt Sir James will in due course bring this fact into prominence.</page><page sequence="9">FOLKLORE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 73 A consideration of the three officials at the Temple at Jerusalem, called the Keepers of the Threshold, opens up a valuable disquisition on the superstition of the sanctity of the threshold, which Sir James attributes to the spirits that are supposed to haunt it. This is followed by a short but most interesting chapter on the Bird-sanctuary. The author quotes the opening verse of the 84th Psalm: "How amiable are thy tabernacles. O Lord of Hosts ! . . . the sparrow hath found her an house and the swallow a nest for herself." A far-off echo of this idea may be found in the family motto of the present writer, taken from this very verse in its older Latin form when it was the 83rd Psalm?"Templa quani dilecta (tua, Domine virtutum)"?which, besides the pun on the name, refers, as I understand, to the old blazon of two bars each charged with three martlets, with a martlet (the footless swift, itself a "folklore" bird) for the crest. Another bird legend?that of Elijah and the ravens?gives rise to an inquiry leading up to the idea of kinship between man and beasts and birds of prey (such as the raven) which batten on human corpses, apparently as part of the general idea of sympathetic magic. An illuminating chapter on the sacred oaks and terebinths of Palestine leads up to another on the High Places of Israel with their oaks or terebinths ano1 sacred pillars and poles. The analogy between the Hebrew word for " widow " and the word for "dumb" leads Sir James to an important series of remarks on the silence imposed on widows by many peoples, though he has a caution at the end of them against building theories on "doubtful etymologies", even if accepted by high authority. Perhaps the shortest of all the chapters is that on Jonah and the Whale, and I cannot help regretting that this great stumbling-block of the Old Testament has not been gone into more fully by comparison with available folklore.</page><page sequence="10">74 NOTICES OF BOOKS This part of the book winds up with the story of Jehovah and the Lions, which gives rise to an important discussion of the ethical standard of "Jehovah, the God of the land ", well worth study. Sir James Frazer concludes his studies of some of the folklore in the early books of the Bible by an inquiry into a few points of the Law, which he introduces by a chapter of great value on the Place of the Law in Jewish History. Especially, to my mind, he does well to lay stress on the distinction between legislation and codification. This is an all-important point to bear in mind in studying the primitive law of any people. Codified oral law was real law and custom and obeyed ) reported legislation not necessarily so. The late King of Burma, Thibaw, was a scholarly man, very "learned in the Law" as understood by the Buddhists, and delighted in issuing edicts containing the loftiest sentiments couched in quite beautiful language, which were dutifully accepted by his courtiers?but, then, no one ever dreamt of carrying them out. In his notices of a few of the precepts of the ancient Jewish law Sir James naturally confines himself to those which reflect the folklore of the time. The first point he takes is the tenth of the original ritual version of the Ten Commandments?" Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mothers milk "?a stumbling-block to critics of all times. And yet it was looked on as a most important law. Sir James examines the question at great length to show that it may probably be referred to sympathetic magic, based, in the interests of the milch animals of a pastoral people, on the sympathy between a mother animal and its milk. The old Hebrew law of boring the ear of a slave who refused to go free is gone into at still greater length to show that it was the result of primitive logic: " you can show your control of a man by the simple process of cutting his car and drawing a few drops of his blood."</page><page sequence="11">FOLKLORE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 75 In the useful chapter which follows this the well known Hebrew custom of cutting the body and shearing the hair in mourning for the dead is fully discussed, with a view to showing that it persevered in spite of being directly forbidden by "the Law", because of the belief that it in some way gratified or benefited the dead, implying a previous " propitiation or worship of the dead ". The only trial by ordeal known to the Jewish Law, that of a suspected adulteress, by making her drink a "bitter water" which had been previously ceremonially cursed, leads to a long inquiry into the ordeal by poison, which is very old and widespread. The object of the curse was obviously to render the water poisonous, and its use among a civilized people is evidence of its antiquity as a survival of savagery. By the oldest Code embodied in the Pentateuch an ox that had gored a man or woman was judicially put to death, and Sir James shows that right up to modern times in civilized Europe the custom of judicial punish ment of animals that have injured or have been supposed to injure human beings arises out of the general savage law of blood revenge. And, linally, Sir James, with many illustrations, refers the golden bells in the fringe of the blue (violet) full dress robe of the Jewish priest to the worldwide idea that the sound of bells frightens away evil spirits?an idea that has led ?to many poetical customs, of course quite difFerently explained by their followers, all the world over. Although I have thus gone at great apparent length through the whole of Sir James Frazer's remarks and arguments, I cannot but feel that I have merely touched the fringe of them, and that his book itself hardly goes beyond the fringe of his mighty subject. Also I cannot help hoping that he has it in his mind to enlighten us</page><page sequence="12">70 NOTICES OF ROOKS still further in his own inimitable way. He has so much of the imagination of the poet in him and so much of the poet's power of expression that he is able to bring before us with extraordinary vividness the scenes in which the old Hebrews acted and the thoughts and emotions that prompted them to act. So much of both, indeed, has he that one hardly feels that one is encroaching on his good nature in asking him for more, where so much more must surely be forthcoming. Should he be able to fall in with such wishes, may 1 suggest a point of inquiry well worth following up in the older parts of the Bible?the ancient commercial transactions in the days before coined money. There is no study I know that so closely brings home to one the daily life of a people at any given period of its civiliza tion, and it is one also that can help us to guess at the stage of the civilization. Abraham bought the Cave of Machpelah with money (? silver) that he weighed out, and its value was assessed in terms of money?a transaction which has caused me to doubt that we have the story in its original form. Primci/ttcic it does not fit in with one's ideas of an early pastoral people. Joseph's brethren carried " bundles of money ". One would like to know more of this, though it was in point of time and place quite a possible occurrence. As one who has lived amongst a people?in their own opinion highly civilized, and no one could say they were not so in many senses?who had no coined money, and weighed and assessed all their bullion for every payment, I feel that a comparative study by an anthropologist of the pecuniary transactions of the ancient Hebrews could not but prove of much value to the student of man and his ways and thoughts.
