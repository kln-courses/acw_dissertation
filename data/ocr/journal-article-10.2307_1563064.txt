<plain_text><page sequence="1">1975 JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY 10(4):277-291 Aggression and Competition in Eastern Plethodon (Amphibia, Urodela, Plethodontidae) Gordon Thurow Department of Biological Sciences, Western Illinois University, Macomb, Illinois 61455, USA ABSTRACT-Aggression (including territoriality, social dominance, and feeding competi- tion) was observed among and between salamanders of different eastern large and eastern small Plethodon. The aggression affects the overlapping food and shelter use in sympatric Plethodon species, and so is a part of competition. The occurrence and frequency of observed interactions are summarized, and certain sequences are narrated, such as P. cinereus versus P. nettingi shenandoah. Eastern large Plethodon tend to behave aggressively toward any Plethodon invading their territory, sympatric or not, unless the invader is much larger. Attack is more likely if the first salamander has a high social ranking in the "neighborhood." The eastern small Plethodon were less well studied. Some did attack other entities, both sympatric and allopatric, but some appeared less aggressive than others, or than eastern large Plethodon. Size and frequency data support size effects and species differences in Plethodon. The effect of age, sex, the territory, and season or time of day are discussed briefly. Aggression between eastern small and eastern large Plethodon was also observed, aggression between genera, and attacks by plethodontids against salamandrids and ambystomids. Less surface activity, and habitat displacement (through increased arboreality) can occur in less dominant Plethodon. Terrarium behavior versus behavior "in nature" is discussed, as well as the probable non-learned nature of many of the poses and movements. * * * INTRODUCTION Various authors have studied ecological interactions between species of Plethodon (e.g., Hairston, 1951; Highton, 1971; Jaeger, 1972; and others cited in these references). Jaeger (1972) discusses the possibility of interspecies interferences, or aggression, between Plethodon cinereus and P. nettingi shenandoah, and rejects it, from the results of two sets of laboratory observations plus miscellaneous observations of terraria over a period of four years. After inquiring about my report (Thurow, 1972b) of interspecies aggression in Plethodon, Jaeger (1974) indicated that "interference" probably does occur between P. cinereus and P. nettingi shenandoah, but he does not report seeing any aggressive or other social behavior. Interspecific and intraspecific aggression do occur in Plethodon, as reported for P. glutinosus, P. ouachitae, and P. caddoensis (Thurow, 1972a, b). This was the second report of salamander territoriality (after Grant, 1955) and, to my knowledge, the first report of individually identified combat peck order sequences, or social hierarchies, for salamanders, and possibly for amphibians. Recent studies of frogs by Bunnell (1973) and McDiarmid and Adler (1974), and studies that they review, do demonstrate territoriality (mostly among males, in association with reproductive activities), but do not work out specific hierarchies involving several individuals. Groups of individually identified captive frogs have been ranked in a feeding hierarchy (Tracy, 1973; Boice and Witter, 1969). However, although the competing feeders could be ranked in terms of success and aggression, this is not the same as a combat hierarchy. Tracy (1973) was not sure of the aggressive nature of the interactions, and Boice and Witter (1969) comment that their feeding hierarchy "lacks the precision of linear dominance hierarchies in domestic chickens." Haubrich (1961) obtained definite aggression and dominance 277</page><page sequence="2">GORDON THUROW within various pairs of Xenopus laevis, but for larger groups he only gave comparative score rankings. He stated that "no absolute displays of dominance of one individual over another are seen." I have observed mixed male and female Plethodon linear hierarchies of three, four, and more individuals, where each level did involve a demonstrated dominance of the individual over its immediate subordinate. I have also observed Plethodon interspecific and intraspecific competition for shelters and various amounts of surrounding area (territorial defense), and both direct competition for food items and indirect competition by exclusion from feeding areas. Aggression between sympatrics obviously influences competition for environmental resources, if there is overlap in resource usage. The occurrence of two Plethodon species nearby under the same type of shelter, and even the same log (Pope, 1950, and others) demonstrates overlap in shelter use. I have observed this also, though typically the two species sharing the large shelter object are not together in the same shelter space. Dietary overlap is shown by several studies (e.g., Pope, 1950, or Powders and Tietjen, 1974), and I have further demonstrated the lack of dietary specificity by causing several species to tongue and snap at a moving pencil tip (projecting above ground level, just outside their terraria). The above aggressive phenomena are widespread in Plethodon, as documented in this preliminary report, where observed aggression (biting) between individuals of the same kind is listed, and also between individuals of different taxonomic entities (Tables 1 and 2). Certain additional observations will be reported, but a more complete analysis will be made elsewhere. MATERIALS, METHODS, AND DEFINITIONS The salamanders to be observed were collected by myself or companions, sometimes stored in refrigerators, and then installed in various terraria, or even in gallon jars. The substrate was soil, usually at least partly capped with an orange-tan glacial till clay from the Macomb area (which gave better contrast with the darker animals). The surface objects (which also sometimes served as shelters) were rocks, clumps of moss, and glass Drosophila containers (half pint or smaller jars, or tubes). Drosophila served as food, occasionally supplemented by earthworms or other compost pile organisms. No burrows were made for the salamanders, but they frequently made their own. Various lighting arrangements were used, from natural daylight through room windows; to constant dim light in walk-in refrigerators (set at approximately 15 C); or to leaving the animals in near darkness in the walk-in refrigerators (black plastic window covers with a few holes admitted some light from the hall, some indirect daylight came in around the blades of an exhaust fan in the hall, and sometimes the hall lights or lights in a nearby observation room were on). These latter animals were observed with the above dim light (an ordinary fluorescent desk lamp with one 15 watt tube, or a gooseneck desk lamp with a 75 watt bulb connected to a voltage regulator so the light could be increased gradually). Most of the observations were made with the third lighting method. Territoriality was first noted in 1968, and studies have been more or less continuous since 1969, averaging better than one observation period per week. Observation periods varied from a few minutes to over six continuous hours (and over 10 hours in a 24 hr period), the observations being recorded in notebooks. Observations have been made at all hours of the 24 hr day, and at all seasons of the year. Neither time of day nor season are referred to in the results reported here because neither appeared to be associated with differences in behavior. In a few cases some males did get into breeding condition for short periods, but not always in the regular breeding season. The change in their behavior was easy to observe. Animals of all sizes and ages were used. It was recorded whether the animal was juvenile; small or immature; and large or adult. The relative sizes of the salamanders in a particular cage were noted, and some animals were weighed and measured from time to time. Actual sizes are usually not referred to in this paper since animals of all sizes (and ages) except sibling recent hatchlings exhibited similar aggressive, territorial, and social hierarchy behavior. 278</page><page sequence="3">AGGRESSION AND COMPETITION IN PLETHODON Individuals in a cage were distinguished by notes about pigment markings or other distinguishing features. Individual recognition became more difficult for more than three animals of the same kind, and was not too practical for more than five. The problem was eased by sometimes picking cage-mates ahead of time that were easier to distinguish. The sex was usually noted also, since possible escape or death without preservation might prevent later sexing. Motion pictures documenting and illustrating fights, feeding competition, appeasement moves, territoriality, and social hierarchies were shown to a number of herpetologists (Thurow, 1972b). It is not my purpose to describe all the details of the behavior data here, but mostly to report aggression between and among various taxonomic entities and to relate this to competition. However, some data are presented to support other conclusions, and operational definitions of some of the behavioral terms used here are apparently necessary. Unless specified otherwise, "aggression" or "attack" means that one salamander bites or attempts to bite another. "Threat" or "bluff" behavior refers to certain characteristic poses or movements that one salamander makes toward another, and which frequently are followed by an attack if the other salamander does not run, perform an appeasement move or pose, or attack first. An "appeasement" move or pose is one that tends to forestall attack, or at least reduce its intensity. A conspicuous example among large eastern Plethodon is an alternate lateral head bend, or "wag." If a salamander "wins" a fight, this means that the other animal runs away, or at least withdraws some. When one salamander attacks another who accepts the attack passively without retaliation or withdrawing, this is not a "fight," but it does indicate who came off best in that encounter. The term "territory" here refers to an area of substrate which is defended and to which the salamander returns. The territory surrounds the favored shelter site, and the salamander will defend either a larger or smaller area, depending on its aggressiveness and fighting ability relative to an intruding salamander. Both a "social hierarchy" and a "peck order" here refer to a linear sequence of combat dominance (who can and does attack and wins fights with whom; and who loses fights, does not retaliate, gives way, or otherwise avoids fights with whom). Social hierarchies can change, and there are other subtleties not discussed here, but social hierarchies were usually linear in my cages, at least within species. The more dominant animal frequently has a larger territory as well as usually winning fights. The dominant generally invades the territories of socially inferior animals more successfully than they can invade its territory. Of course one cannot look at a cage of salamanders and instantaneously determine the presence of territories and a social hierarchy. My method involves patient and painstaking recording of observations on a cage over a period of time, by which one can eventually determine who will defend what area, and who wins against whom. I use the term "learning" here to mean a modification of behavior that is apparently influenced by experience, and "remembering" to indicate a persistence of the modified behavior. One other behavioral term is the "fixed action pattern." While some would like to believe that this term has a precise ethological definition, different authors (Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1970:15,42, and Hinde, 1970:21) give somewhat different definitions, and both indicate that a particular fixed action pattern (FAP) may have some variability. In the present paper, a FAP is taken to mean certain "form-constant" movements that apparently do not have to be learned by the animal (since they are similar in juveniles and adults), and whose form seems independent of stimuli from the environment. Also the pattern of movements cannot be subdivided into a "chain" of responses with each depending on different external stimuli for their elicitation. Some additional terms are defined in the text below. OBSERVATIONS AND DISCUSSION General.-Jaeger (1972) did not observe any aggression in his experiments because Plethodon usually do not show such aggression until they become familiar with a terrarium and 279</page><page sequence="4">GORDON THUROW begin to set up territories and social hierarchies. This usually takes more than the four days he used, particularly if the animals are without previous terrarium experience. I do not know why he saw no aggression over four years of terrarium observations. Salamanders will eventually habituate to the presence of an observer, but even then their behavior will be disturbed or inhibited if the observer makes large or rapid movements while the attention of the salamanders is directed to the observer. The word "attention" does not imply any anthropomorphic assumptions here about what, if anything, is going on in the salamander's brain. I merely mean that if the animal's head is facing the observer and its eyes are open, then this is a bad time for the observer to be moving. In Jaeger's 1974 work, which appears to have been influenced by my report (Thurow, 1972b), he apparently did not attempt direct observations of aggressive behavior. The example below shows that aggression is a part of the relation between Plethodon cinereus and P. nettingi shenandoah. Example of Aggression Between Two Sympatric Entities.-The following 1972 sequence is one of many for these two forms, recorded from several cages. One of the smaller terraria (measuring 36.0 X 21.5 X 26.0 cm outside) contained four P. nettingi shenandoah which had been observed over a period of ten weeks. A clear linear social hierarchy had been established, so that the individuals could be referred to by dominance number, and territories had been set up. The male and female at the top of the peck order had a varying mutual tolerance and partly shared the main part of the cage; the third animal defended a narrow "alley" at the left end of the cage behind two Drosophila bottles and a clump of moss; and the last animal (#4) spent most of its time underground or high on the cage wall, and was not observed to defend a territory. All these animals were adults. I dropped an adult P. cinereus of similar size from another terrarium into the center of the cage. This individual's previous behavior indicated that the animal could be expected to soon explore the new cage actively, rather than hiding for some time as do some other individuals. In a few minutes the #1 P. n. shenandoah went over after the new animal, attacked it (bit it), and chased it into the left rear corner of the cage. This was the territory of #3, who attacked the P. cinereus by biting and holding its flank. After both rolled and twisted, the P. cinereus broke loose and ran back to the right, toward the rear center of the cage, but stopped and turned back when it saw #1 there. The P. cinereus was promptly bitten again (on the nose) by #3 and chased back out. Things got a bit more complex after that. The #1 animal followed #2 to the left front; later #3 nipped at #1's tail (which was hanging off a Drosophila jar into #3's territory), #1 turned toward #3 but both withdrew; the P. cinereus wandered into #3's territory again and was attacked with a bite to the tail and chased out; in following, #3 lost contact with the P. cinereus, came up behind #2 in the small crevice between two parallel Drosophila jars, and attacked it (possibly confusing it with the P. cinereus); #2 ran out to the right, but then turned and charged back, driving #3 back into its territory. Later the P. cinereus came out to the center front and #1 seized its tail tip and was jerked into the air as the P. cinereus fled, breaking loose and circling the cage clockwise. After about half an hour from the introduction of the P. cinereus, all five salamanders were out on the surface, in an apparently excited state, the P. cinereus "freezing" in the left front of the cage (near the boundary of #3's territory). The animal appeared to be "learning" the location of the territories in the cage by trial and error, and the behavior of other Plethodon in other cages indicates that they can learn and remember the location of each other's territories. I removed the P. cinereus at this point. Aggressive Reactions Within and Between Eastern Plethodon Populations.-Tables 1 and 2 summarize my terrarium observations on interactions between various populations of Plethodon. The animals are not arranged taxonomically, but in terms of sympatry. As one reads from left to right along the rows, an "A" indicates that the entity at the left hand margin was observed to attack (bite) the entity in that column at least once. A smaller "a" indicates a few cases where more indirect evidence was used. Indications of P. wehrlei attacks on introduced P. glutinosus and P. caddoensis, and P. richmondi attacks on P. dorsalis and P. richmondi came from bite marks (the second and third victims were killed) and the fact that fhe presumed 280</page><page sequence="5">AGGRESSION AND COMPETITION IN PLETHODON TABLE 1.

In the cases of P. wehrlei attacks on P. yonahlossee, or P. n. hubrichti attacks on P. welleri, the "victim" was seen to enter the shelter occupied by the other animal, bodies jerked, and the apparent loser suddenly leapt out from under the shelter and ran off. Experience makes me rather certain that bites were delivered, although the view was blocked. The lack of an "A" or "a" does not mean that attacks could not occur, and the lack of positive data in Table 1 probably is an artifact. P. wehrlei and P. ouachitae were together in a cage a few times, but the conditions were not favorable. Similarly, although P. caddoensis specimens were in cages with all the other entities (and were attacked by them), I did not introduce smaller or similar size "invaders" from the other entities into a cage where P. caddoensis had established a territory because of technical difficulties in establishing such cages. For Table 2, I did put all the possible combinations together (though sometimes conditions were not favorable) except some with P. n. nettingi. So a reduced number of "A" marks across certain rows in Table 2 may have some meaning, and is discussed below. There were certain additions and omissions to the possible Plethodon populations in Tables 1 and 2. P. longicrus (L) is included separately, although Highton (1971:172) states that Dennis found intermediate specimens indicating gene flow with P. yonahlossee. I know of no data to support this, and even if gene flow were to be demonstrated, this in itself would not justify Highton's assumption that the two populations do not even rank as subspecies. The recently described Plethodon punctatus and P. hoffmani (Highton, 1971) are omitted because they were not available for study. If these new forms are distinct from P. wehrlei and P. richmondi, I would expect the aggressive behavior to be similar because of close taxonomic relationship. There are some interspecific differences in Plethodon aggressive behavior, but so far the similarities are great enough so that I would not expect much difference between geographic races (subspecies). However, in Table 1 the P. jordani (J) material only includes animals formerly referred to as P. j. metcalfi. In Table 2 the P. welleri (WlI) material includes only P. w. ventromaculatus. However, both P. d. dorsalis and P. d. angusticlavius were observed, and P. c. serratus as well as P. c. cinereus, although the "A" marks in the Cn row of Table 2 represent only P. c. cinereus. Sympatry between entities is indicated by an "S" in Tables 1 and 2. Sympatry and allopatry are terms usually applied only to interspecies comparisons, but the concept can also be applied to parts of species populations. Neither term applies to intra-entity combinations, marked by a "( )" in Tables 1 and 2. Otherwise, a lack of S marks indicates allopatry. In Table 1, P. ouachitae and P. caddoensis are known to be macrogeographically allopatric from each other, and from all other Plethodon except P. glutinosus. Presently published localities for P. yonahlossee and P. longicrus refer to geographically separated populations (of different appearance). P. wehrlei and P. longicrus populations are macrogeographically separate. The small "s" marks refer to situations somewhat between clear allopatry and sympatry. The "s" at the P. yonahlossee-P. wehrlei intercepts refers to the possible minor area of sympatry on Whitetop 281</page><page sequence="6">GORDON THUROW Mountain (Highton, 1962) and to the adjacency of the ranges. The "s" at the P. wehrlei-P. jordani intercepts also refers to close adjacency and to macrogeographic overlap in the Whitetop Mountain area, although I do not know of mixed local populations. In Table 2, P. cinereus is the only form known to be closely associated with P. n. shenandoah, P. n. nettingi, and P. n. hubrichti. The "s" marks placed at the intercepts of P. cinereus with P. n. shenandoah, P. n. hubrichti, and P. welleri indicate that these populations tend to exclude each other locally, although they are found in the same areas. My field experience with P. n. shenandoah versus P. cinereus distribution on Hawksbill Mountain generally corresponds with Jaeger's (1970, 1972). However, I did find both larger and smaller P. n. shenandoah and P. cinereus under the same shelter objects at the west edge of the talus area, some appearing to be over 9 m from the talus. Populations of P. n. hubrichti usually exclude P. cinereus which surrounds them, but Highton (1971:155) did cite one locality where a few P. cinereus were present. I usually find either pure P. cinereus or pure P. welleri populations locally, but on two occasions I did find some overlap between two adjacent populations which had been separated during several previous visits. P. welleri and P. richmondi are usually not found mixed together either, but there is one case to the contrary. I re-identified one of three P. welleri specimens (cited by Hoffman, 1953) as a P. richmondi, as did Highton (1962:277), so an "s" appears at those intercepts. The "s" at the P. welleri-P. dorsalis intercepts indicates close adjacency only. Snyder (1946) reported P. welleri from higher elevations of Flat Top Mountain and I found P. dorsalis in a talus pile along the lower northern slope of the same mountain, which gives a macrogeographic overlap of their ranges. It can be seen that there are more cases of clear sympatry among large eastern Plethodon (Table 1) than in small eastern Plethodon (Table 2), and this would also be true for several different ways of listing taxonomic entities under these two categories. Three-member mixed populations occur in the eastern large Plethodon (i.e., P. glutinosus-P. jordani-P. yonahlossee, or P. glutinosus-P. jordani-P. longicrus, and I have confirmed these in the field), but none have been described for eastern small Plethodon. A greater number of cases involving partial reduction of interspecific competition may thus have developed in the eastern large Plethodon. There are enough positive data in Tables 1 and 2 to examine the relation between sympatry and occurrence of aggression. In six large Plethodon and three small ones there is clear evidence that the animals will attack allopatric species with which they have no previous experience, as well as sympatrics. In other words, there has been no special training or genetic modification which limits this behavior to sympatric species. The remaining five salamander entities in Tables 1 and 2 give no evidence to the contrary. Thus territorial defense toward any other Plethodon appears characteristic for most Plethodon at least, and one can predict this part of any presently unknown sympatric relationship that may be found, if territoriality has been observed in one or both of the species. Tables 1 and 2 merely report the occurrence of attacks (biting) and do not specify territorial defense. However, most of those attacks did involve territorial defense, and I did witness clear territorial defense in all the entities except P. richmondi, P. dorsalis, P. welleri, and P. n. nettingi. One probable example of territoriality occurred in a more recent P. n. nettingi cage, but has not been repeated yet. It is illuminating to review the observations relating to less evidence for aggression in these last four species (Table 2). In P. n. nettingi as in P. caddoensis, the lack of results may only reflect less testing. Long-term observations were only made on one good cage, established 4 July 1972, with three P. n. nettingi. After an initial adjustment period, fights were noted from 20 July to 4 August, and a social hierarchy was apparently set up. However, continued aggression did not occur, as in some P. n. hubrichti, P. n. shenandoah, and P. cinereus cages. Three P. cinereus were added to the cage at various times from 4 August 1972 and later, and two were left there. Between 28 Feb. 1973 and 29 March 1973, all three P. n. nettingi were placed in other cages for different periods, and after that only one was left in the original cage, with the two P. cinereus. It became emaciated and was found dead of apparent starvation on 29 July 1973, although both P. cinereus were still in good condition and appeared well 282</page><page sequence="7">AGGRESSION AND COMPETITION IN PLETHODON nourished. P. n. nettingi was not definitely observed to attack any other form, although some nips at some P. cinereus might possibly have occurred. More observations are needed. Twelve cages of two or more P. welleri have been observed (some for only a short time); over seven with some P. richmondi; and over 14 with some P. dorsalis. I have spent enough time observing these three forms to feel that they are less likely to show aggression than P. cinereus, or P. n. hubrichti, or P. n. shenandoah. Observation conditions and habituation to the observer were not as good as I would wish for the P. richmondi, but I feel P. cinereus under the same conditions would have shown more aggression. In the one case where I saw (an immature) P. richmondi bite another salamander (a smaller immature P. cinereus), the P. richmondi was startled because the other animal had been dropped into the cage beside it. No more attacks were seen, although these two animals remained together for four months. Aggressive attacks between male P. welleri in breeding conditions were reported by Organ (1960). 1 also observed this. One male attacked two smaller males in a cage, after failing in several attempts to initiate courtship with a female. This was in early January, three months after capture. However, in other cages I witnessed much apparently harmonious association between P. welleri individuals, who were often close together and not in separate territories as in the cages of some other Plethodon. In one cage where two males and a female had been together for seven months with no previously noted aggression, the female nipped the smaller (nearly mature or barely mature) male several times one day in January, as he twice attempted to approach. But she did not pursue, or press the attack further, and she never was observed to attack again (nor did the others), though the three were together for four more months. Among some other entities (P. cinereus or P. n. shenandoah), bitter feuds could go on for months, and full-gape bulldog-type jaw holds could be exchanged, rather than mere nips. On one other occasion, an immature P. welleri nipped a larger immature P. richmondi on the head, although the two animals had been apparently harmonious cage-mates for almost nine weeks. If there is such a thing as "frustration" in salamanders, this may have been involved, since the P. we/leri had just missed in three successive feeding attempts at a fly, and the P. richmondi had come up and brought its head close immediately afterwards. In general, P. welleri, P. n. nettingi, and P. richmondi probably show some territoriality in nature, as I often find them spaced apart and one to a shelter object. With larger cages (of more than 2 sq. ft. of floor space) and more time, I might still observe territoriality in captivity. However, P. cinereus, P. n. hubrichti, and P. n. shenandoah did exhibit territoriality, and a larger number of attacks, even in similarly small cages. Special comment is necessary on P. dorsalis, because of extensive observations I made without ever seeing any clear aggression. Two cages with varying numbers of P. d. dorsalis were observed for two years (1952-1954), and two cages with some P. d. angusticlavius for over 1.5 years (1964-1966). All four cages were in basement windows. Some courtship was observed in both time periods, indicating that the animals were not too disturbed for social behavior. A few small juveniles disappeared or showed tail amputations that suggested cannibalistic predation, but no aggression was seen. Some P. cinereus shared the cages for the last four to six months each time. From 1969 to the present writing, over 10 cages with two or more P. dorsalis have been observed, one for more than 15 months. Three of these cages also contained P. cinereus. My conclusion is that P. dorsalis characteristically does not attack other P. dorsalis or P. cinereus, with the exception of predation on smaller juveniles under conditions of crowding and insufficient food. Although I never saw P. dorsalis bite another salamander, I once saw a large adult intimidate two smaller P. glutinosus juveniles. When first observed, the P. dorsalis appeared to be in a "face-off" with one P. glutinosus at the mouth of a food (Drosophila) jar-that is, they were face to face for some time. The P. dorsalis then turned and left, and, with several pauses that gave the appearance of hesitancy, the P. glutinosus advanced and bit the retreating tail tip of the P. dorsalis. The P. dorsalis then turned back, placing its body in a "U," and faced the P. glutinosus. A Plethodon can strike like a snake from this "U" position, and I have seen them do it many times. Experience has shown me that merely assuming this position and waiting 283</page><page sequence="8">GORDON THUROW communicates a threat-in other words, it is a threat pose. I have even prodded a P. ouachitae with a pencil, paused after the "U" pose was assumed, prodded the animal again, and had it deliver a strong bite to the pencil. Other salamanders react to the "U" pose (and other threat poses), and in this case the P. glutinosus stopped and froze in front of the P. dorsalis. At this point a second juvenile P. glutinosus fell off a cage wall to land nearby. The P. dorsalis advanced toward it, and after a pause, this P. glutinosus ran off rapidly. Then the P. dorsalis turned back toward the first P. glutinosus. My notes record that after a pause I took my eyes away for a second, but then from the periphery of my vision saw the P. dorsalis lunge forward. I did not see whether the P. dorsalis actually snapped at the P. glutinosus or merely executed a bluff lunge, but I did see that it did not contact the P. glutinosus, who leapt away and ran. Then the P. dorsalis returned to the mouth of the Drosophila jar and started feeding. The Effect of Size on Aggression.-Aggression, territoriality, and hierarchial behavior were exhibited by juveniles (in their first year), immatures, subadults, and adults. Specifically, some aggression was observed among immatures as well as adults of every large eastern Plethodon in Table 1 except perhaps P. wehrlei; and among immatures and adults of P. cinereus, P. welleri, P. n. shenandoah, and P. n. hubrichti of the small eastern Plethodon in Table 2, plus an attack (above) by an immature P. richmondi. I did not see aggressiveness among siblings (of Cn, R, D, and Wl, Table 2) during the first few days after hatching, and for various reasons good observations were not continued for much longer periods. The recent hatchlings may lack the behavior merely because the nervous system has not matured enough for the behavior to appear, and since less than one-year-old animals showed aggressive behavior similar to that of adults, it does not appear to me that some of the rather form-constant poses and actions are learned. Within a particular species there was no obvious change in aggressiveness with size, but there could be a very pronounced change in behavior and combat success as affected by the relative size of the potential opponent. If two salamanders differed in size, the larger one generally had a combat advantage, as in dogs, man, or any vertebrate. Several kinds of data indicate the advantage of size in conclusive "contests," which I here define as encounters where at least one animal was biting, and one of the animals "lost," in that it ran away, or otherwise definitely gave ground.

Con- clusive contests were observed for every entity except Plethodon rich- mondi and P. dorsalis. In some cases an obvious difference in size was ap- parent, in others the difference is based on weighing data. Many other inconclusive or interrupted fights were also observed, and many where I was not sure (or did not record) who was the larger animal. There were also bluffs and various other tense encounters which sometimes indicated dominance, but did not in- volve biting. The use of X2 tests supports the advantage of larger size in winning conclusive contests, al- though the data were too few to give statistically significant results for most individual entities. Data for conclusive contests 284</page><page sequence="9">AGGRESSION AND COMPETITION IN PLETHODON with a known size differential between the entities of Tables 1 and 2 are shown in Table 4. Again I lumped the less numerous results under "other," not only to shorten an otherwise cumbersome table, but to indicate a different degree of randomness of the data. The larger number of contests for particular entity pairs were generated from cages usually containing two to eight individuals of not too different size (I usually did not put juveniles and large adults together, knowing that there might be predation). On the other hand, the less numerous contest data for entity pairs were more often derived from my conscious efforts to fill in the various combinations of Tables 1 and 2. To do this with less waiting time I often put a somewhat smaller animal into a cage with another that had demonstrated it would defend a territory. Of course the smaller animal could theoretically have beaten the larger, but this group of "other" data generally would seem to be biased in favor of the larger animal winning. Table 4 supports the view that a larger individual of Plethodon has an advantage in a fight, and all the X2 tests show statistical significance except for P. glutinosus versus P. ouachitae, discussed below. A smaller body of intra-entity contest data was obtained with the actual weights of the contestants, taken to .01 gm on a Sartorius toploading balance. The animals' weights can change with time, due to growth, egg development, or starvation, but many adults changed very little over a period of years. I arbitrarily included weight data if the animals had been weighed within three months of the contest. Table 5 shows the results for three species of large eastern Plethodon (G, 0, and Cd, Table 1) plus combined data for four small eastern Plethodon (Cn, Wl, H, and S, Table 2). The statistics show rather good agreement, considering the sample sizes and the different sizes reached by the entities. However, when one compares all four columns, both the percent of larger animal wins and the percent of average winner/loser weights appear to trend downward with smaller size among the taxonomic entities. If confirmed, it is perhaps not too surprising that there might be less weight difference in contestants from entities with a smaller total size range. And since the relative weight differences between contestants appear to be less in small eastern Plethodon, it is not surprising if the larger contestants win less often there. The summed ratio results in Table 3 are in harmony with this. As a whole, the weight data do confirm that greater weight does give a combat advantage. In addition to statistically significant X2 results for P. glutinosus and P. ouachitae (shown in Table 3), one gets an X2 value of 4.6 (P is between .046 and .025) for combined small eastern Plethodon and P. caddoensis results. Even the smaller number of weighed contests give significant X2 results for P. glutinosus and P. ouachitae (Table 5) and significantly different mean weights by the "t" test (Table 5). Similar weight data for contests between entities are shown in Table 6. In this case we are again ignoring which entity won (as in Table 4), and merely noting whether the larger animal TABLE 5.

The lumped eastern small Plethodon results largely involve the same entities as in Table 5: Cn versus WI, H, and S; and S versus WI (remembering that P. welleri did no biting in these contests, only fleeing). Two attacks by S on N are also included. The results for the totalled small eastern Plethodon data are not too different from those in Table 5, considering the small samples. However, a notably higher win ratio appears for contests involving P. n. shenandoah, and this is the only group of contests where the average weights of winner and loser are significantly different. The results for P. glutinosus versus P. ouachitae show striking differences from their separate intraspecies combat data in Table 5 (in spite of contradictory #2 X2 results for the weighed portion as compared to the total result, in Table 4): a marked drop in the win ratios, and a larger average weight for the loser than the winner. The notably different intraspecies and interspecies data suggest a species difference in aggressiveness and/or fighting ability per gram of weight, as discussed in the next section. It must be noted, however, that overall, Table 6 results still support the view that the larger combat partner wins more often, in interspecies as well as intraspecies encounters. Again, greater weight differences tend to accompany higher win percentages for the larger animal, but they both do not relate to comparative body size of the entities as much as in Table 5. Comparisons of totalled large and small Plethodon data in Table 4 agree with this feature, in that the larger forms do not have a higher win ratio, as in Table 3. As in Table 5, statistical tests were not performed in some cases where the differences appeared insignificant. Greater weight (usually accompanied by greater size and strength, and larger teeth) not only confers a physical advantage to a salamander combatant, but a psychological one as well. These animals have repeatedly demonstrated to me that they can judge size and distance-ie., that they have proprioceptive ability. They show this when they run into a shelter hole; when they reach back to the correct area to eat their recently shed skin; when they execute a coordinated jump and tongue extension to catch a fly; and in the way they can maneuver their tail and body just out of biting range of an opponent. Since they can judge the different sizes of moving objects, it is not surprising that they act differently toward the same kind of opponent or food object, depending on its size. Most Plethodon species become increasingly shy and retiring when there are salamanders over twice as large in the same cage, whether the same or a different species is involved. There is good reason for this. Although Plethodon are not known to prey on other salamanders as readily as Gyrinophilus, or even Desmognathus, cannibalism (usually of much smaller individuals) has been reported in nature (Powders, 1973). I observed direct and indirect evidence of this in terraria, once finding a P. yonahlossee who was swallowing a much smaller P. jordani. In other cases, some small eastern Plethodon showed major tail amputations after being put in the same cage with a large P. wehrlei. 286</page><page sequence="11">AGGRESSION AND COMPETITION IN PLETHODON Another interesting form of predation occurred in a few cases between animals of more equal size. In various attacks, tail tip amputations sometimes occurred, and sometimes I witnessed the wriggling tail tip being eaten. All this could have been more or less accidental, and not all amputated tails were eaten. However, in two cages where a "tyrant" P. ouachitae was firmly established, it sneaked up behind cage-mates, grasped the tip of their tail, rolled rapidly to break the tip, and then ate it. Species Differences.-Not enough observations were made to compare all the species, but some differences in aggression do appear likely. Mere comparison of the number of aggressions seen per entity does not establish species differences, since different amounts of observation time were spent per entity. No accurate records of aggressions per man-hour of observation time are available, because I was simultaneously observing several cages per room, and conditions varied. Although Tables 1 and 2 do not show itemized frequency data, they do show how many of the possible kinds of attacks were witnessed for each entity, and this gives a rough index of the ease with which aggression was observed. As discussed earlier, the relatively sparser record of laboratory attacks for P. caddoensis is probably artifact, and all the large eastern Plethodon were quite aggressive at some times. The sparser record in Table 2 for P. richmondi, P. welleri, and P. n. nettingi might be at least partly artifact, and the total lack of even intraspecies aggression for P. dorsalis after much observation, is taken as evidence that this species is less aggressive than most of the other small eastern Plethodon. In nature P. dorsalis are sometimes spread out under individual shelters, but I have also found large numbers very close together. TABLE 7. Contest win frequencies for different Plethodon.

Sufficient quantitative aggression data exist for some comparisons, and are summarized in Table 7. The observations are, of course, not strictly comparable because the total opponents differed as to species composition and average size. But win-loss records do give some indication of fighting ability. Among the large Plethodon most win rates are not statistically higher or lower than random. It is interesting to note similar and larger win percentages for P. yonahlossee and P. longicrus, which are larger species, as against P. jordani, P. wehrlei, and P. caddoensis-species which attain a smaller size. The ratings for P. glutinosus and P. ouachitae are both influenced by the large number of contests observed between these two forms, and so are subject to question, since P. ouachitae won a very significantly greater number of its 66 recorded contests with P. glutinosus. In 40 contests between P. glutinosus and P. ouachitae 287</page><page sequence="12">GORDON THUROW where one animal was known to be larger, P. ouachitae won 29 times, even though it was the smaller animal 16 of those times. When the P. glutinosus won, it was the larger combatant 9 out of 11 times. The smaller number of fights where weights were taken (Table 6) give 16/24 wins by P. ouachitae, though it was the smaller fighter in 5 cases. When the P. glutinosus won, it was the smaller fighter in only 2 of these 8 cases. Sympatric P. glutinosus are known to reach a larger size than P. ouachitae (Pope, 1951, and my own observations), so it is not surprising that the average P. ouachitae weight in the 24 contests was 3.43 gm, while the average P. glutinosus weight was 4.165 gm. If one combines the P. yonahlossee versus P. ouachitae data (5 fights) with the above 40 contests, the trend is even more extreme: P. ouachitae won 33/45 fights, even though it was the smaller animal in 19 of those 33 wins; P. glutinosus or P. yonahlossee were larger in 10 of their 12 wins over a P. ouachitae. The above indicate that, per gram of weight, P. ouachitae is a better fighter than P. glutinosus, at least. Subjective impressions agree with this, and some are instructive. In one cage 61 X 32.5 X 41 cm external dimensions, a P. ouachitae of about 2.5 gm was put in with four P. glutinosus weighing over 3 gm (two weighed over 5 gm). Although twice having its tail badly amputated, the P. ouachitae kept attacking as well as avoiding, was able to defend a smaller shelter crevice (after abandoning a larger one), and was still in good shape 141/2 months later, by which time three of the four P. glutinosus had died or become moribund, becoming emaciated first. These four P. glutinosus had lived together for 18 months before the P. ouachitae was introduced. Two larger P. ouachitae in a smaller (45.7 X 25.4 X 23.3cm) cage had a very noxious effect on a variety of similar sized or larger P. glutinosus that were added, many of which died, even though some had successful previous cage histories. In a third still smaller (33 X 22.8 X 22 cm) cage, a P. ouachitae was introduced and the resident P. yonahlossee (which appeared to be over twice as large) advanced toward it. Before the resident could attack, the P. ouachitae bit it several times, and the P. yonahlossee backed up. Soon after, it was routed again. A little while later the P. ouachitae attacked again, but in this sequence the larger P. yonahlossee started biting back, and the P. ouachitae fled up the cage wall. Table 7 data for interspecies contests between small eastern Plethodon are less numerous. Only P. n. shenandoah shows more than random success against its opponents, which are mostly P. cinereus. P. cinereus won 10/20 fights with P. n. shenandoah, including the only five fights where the smaller animal won. If one lumps P. n. shenandoah and P. n. hubrichti as opponents, P. cinereus won 14/28 fights, including the only 8 where the smaller animal won. Since P. cinereus won only half the fights, it failed to demonstrate the degree of superiority that P. ouachitae showed over P. glutinosus P. cinereus may be a better fighter per gram of weight. However, I have seen smaller P. n. shenandoah oppose large P. cinereus very vigorously. P. n. hubrichti and P. n. shenandoah reach a larger size than P. cinereus (Highton, 1962; Jaeger, 1972; Thurow, 1968; and additional unpublished data), and this helps to explain why they can pretty well exclude P. cinereus from the P. n. hubrichti range and the Hawksbill Mountain part of the P. n. shenandoah range (Jaeger, 1970; Highton, 1971; and my own unpublished observations). Since greater size confers a combat advantage and tends to intimidate another Plethodon even if there is no fighting, those species of Plethodon which reach a larger size would presumably find this advantageous in competing with other entities. Thus, superior invading ability as well as less food competition would appear to explain the average larger size of those P. n. shenandoah found over 3m outside of the talus by Jaeger (1972). When the size difference becomes great enough, two species would become so different that competition is reduced-e.g., as in sympatric large and small eastern Plethodon (this situation is discussed by Dunn, 1926, and compared to a similar one in weasels). The idea that more aggressive forms might have larger ranges as a consequence appears unsupported by the differences which appear so far. Although P. ouachitae is apparently more aggressive per gram than P. glutinosus, the former has a much smaller range. And although the wide ranging P. cinereus is quite aggressive, so are P. n. hubrichti and P. n. shenandoah, which have very restricted ranges. 288</page><page sequence="13">AGGRESSION AND COMPETITION IN PLETHODON Other Factors Affecting Aggressive Activity. -A few additional factors may be commented on: 1) Age: This was most obviously a factor in connection with size. That is, in a few cases younger animals grew in size and moved up the peck order or social dominance hierarchy. This happened most obviously when immatures of a larger species were kept with other animals of a smaller species. 2) Sex: No obvious permanent sex effect was observed as in some mammals, where the males may reach a larger size, where maleness tends to raise social dominance, and there may be separate male and female hierarchies. In Plethodon the females reach a slightly larger size (Pope, 1950, and Pope and Pope, 1949, 1951) and the most dominant animal in a cage with mixed sexes could be either a male or a female. When in breeding condition, males tend to attack any other males and to court rather than fight females. Presumably a female in breeding condition would also temporarily relax hostilities toward members of the opposite sex. Possibly all-male cages might prove to have more aggression than all-female cages, even outside of breeding periods, but this would be difficult to prove without large numbers of unisex cages. Also it is rather difficult to tell when the males are behaviorally in breeding condition if there are no females present. Most of my cages were of mixed sexes, and I noticed no clear advantage by sex. Either sex could have a high or low social position, mostly depending upon relative size. 3) Position on the territory: I have repeatedly seen cases where one animal will drive another away from the home shelter of the first one, only to be in turn driven back when they got to the other animal's area. This is not to say that an overmatched salamander cannot be driven from its shelter, as I have seen this happen several times. But when two fairly closely matched animals fight out in the open, the winner can change depending on the location relative to the established territories. A much smaller animal can also sometimes successfully defend a burrow or a corner (and this is counted here as a "win" if the other animal leaves), even though it could not win out in the open. The salamanders appear to learn how much territory their cage-mates can hold and are attempting to hold; and if their relative fighting ability does not change, things can become quite stable. However, if salamanders are added to a cage, the areas occupied (and even fought for) by the other animals in the cage can change in a few days, hours, or even minutes. Territory adjustments lag more when an animal is removed from a cage or suddenly becomes a less capable fighter. It is particularly interesting to note the altered behavior of an animal when it is transferred from a cage where it is the dominant ("alpha" or "tyrant") animal to one where it is not. The most dominant is, of course, aggressive toward every other salamander in the cage and may even snap or "bluff-snap" (with closed jaws) at a pencil introduced into the cage and still held by the human observer. One tyrant, a P. cinereus, occupied a cylindrical terrarium (25.5 cm wide by 25.5 cm high) with a slightly smaller P. cinereus, a still smaller P. n. shenandoah, and a recently introduced P. n. nettingi. On 12 March, after attacking (and chasing) all its cage-mates, it was transferred to another room into a cage with two P. n. nettingi and one other P. cinereus. The visitor explored the cage boldly, and there were no fights. Three days later it was placed in the cage with the four P. n. shenandoah described near the beginning of this paper. It explored boldly again, lightly nipped #1,who did nothing, and was attacked by #2. Eventually the visiting P. cinereus took up a position under and between two Drosophila containers, and no further attacks were witnessed. It had not completely dominated the inmates nor had they completely dominated it. However, the visitor was noticeably less aggressive than it had been at home. Seventeen days after it had left, the former tyrant was returned to its home cage in its original room, along with a new P. n. nettingi larger than itself, to replace the other one which had been removed. Within 25 minutes the former tyrant reasserted its dominance, attacking all three other salamanders in the cage. There was no exploration period, and it appeared to "remember" the old cage, its two former cage-mates, and the fact that it was dominant in this cage. 4) Time of day, or time of year (season): After over 25 years of field work with Plethodon, I am quite aware that in nature social and territorial behavior could not take place 289</page><page sequence="14">GORDON THUROW at all seasons, nor characteristically at all hours of the diel cycle. However, in my walk-in refrigerator rooms I did observe social and territorial behavior all year for several years, and at just about any hour of the day or night. Aggressive Interactions Between More Distantly Related Taxonomic Entities.-Aggressive interactions also occur between immature large eastern Plethodon and eastern small Plethodon, like the P. glutinosus-P. dorsalis example described above. But when the large Plethodon approach their full size, the relationship becomes more like predator-prey, and the small eastern Plethodon become relatively secretive and retiring in a mixed cage. They burrow and climb a lot and tend to disappear, the remaining ones often showing major tail amputations. In the field I have seen spatial arrangements that support this. In some areas I have found roughly evenly spaced P. cinereus in a "polka-dot" pattern under various shelters on the forest floor. Here and there at less frequent intervals, there would be a larger space or gap, whose center was occupied by a larger shelter containing a large eastern Plethodon (on one occasion P. wehrlei, on some others P. glutinosus). I did not make measurements or take counts at the time, but I believe that other field workers with years of experience would confirm that such patterns exist, and that it is unusual to find a small eastern Plethodon in or even within a few inches of a shelter space containing a large eastern Plethodon. I have even observed non-predatory intergeneric and interfamilial aggression against similar sized animals (usually "newcomers" to the cage): P. n. shenandoah attacking Eurycea bislineata; P. cinereus and also P. n. shenandoah nipping at red efts of Notophthalmus viridescens; and one attack by P. glutinosus on an Ambystoma texanum. Habitat Modification as Affected by Plethodon Aggression.-Plethodon confined with a superior combatant not only stay under cover more but some even spend much time underground. Since many Plethodon show a natural tendency to construct burrows, even when not socially subordinate, this could not clearly be interpreted as a habitat change. However a definite shift toward arboreality was noticed, and this would appear to be a habitat shift, as Plethodon are generally not considered arboreal, although they climb well. This could easily be demonstrated by placing animals in a very small cage, such as a gallon jar, and not providing alternate shelter. Subordinate animals frequently avoided aggressive contact by climbing, and some spent most of their time off the ground. Some of the Plethodon in rectangular cages took up permanent residence near the ceiling, some utilizing space under a metal strip bent around the top of the glass wall. This arboreal shift from the usual habitat could take place quite readily when there was intraspecies or interspecies aggression, and was more likely as the aggres- sion increased, and as the space per salamander and number of alternate refuges decreased. Behavior in Terraria versus Behavior in Nature.-Some investigators may believe that terrarium observations do not apply in nature. The relative frequencies of some of the behavior patterns probably are different. Specifically, I would guess that there is more territorial and less hierarchial behavior in nature, due to the lack of space in some of the cages. A similar situation has been noted for some reptiles (Brattstrom, 1974). However, some of the particular aggressive, threat, and appeasement poses and actions (not all described here) do appear rather stereotyped, or "form-constant"-although of course the total sequence of events is not. I believe some poses and movements will be shown to fit the definition of inherited or "fixed action pattern" given earlier. It seems unlikely that behavior used this extensively in terraria, by recently caught as well as long captive animals, has no use or occurrence in nature. Some of this aggressive behavior has been observed in the field (Hutchison, 1959, and others), although the observers were not sure of the context of the behavior. Dr. R. E. Gordon (pers. comm.) saw some of the same appeasement moves (alternate lateral head wags) in the field, but was unfamiliar with their meaning. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I thank E.
