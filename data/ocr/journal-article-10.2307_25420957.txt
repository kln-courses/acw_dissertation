CONCO British Medical Journal, 1973, 3, 331-333 "Many diseases are rare or unknown in all less-developed communities and common in all economically developed coun tries. ... The most significant factor is the manner in which all these diseases tend to increase in frequency... a gradation of the prevalence ... according to the extent to which Western customs, especially dietary habits, have been adopted."? Burkitt.1 Summary Recent claims that "diseases of Western civilization" are rare in rural African communities may not be justified. African peasants have a high pain threshold; many attend traditional healers rather than Western-trained doctors; and their language contains no words to express the descriptive terms used in Western medicine for the symptoms and clinical features of these diseases. Introduction Comparative geographical epidemiology is useful in suggesting hypotheses about the cause of certain diseases, but epidemio logical observations are often based on personal experience rather than formal scientific study. In developing countries there are many difficulties in medical communication, including distance and economic, sociocultural, psychosocial, and lin guistic barriers. The problem, perhaps, is not so much that certain diseases do not affect these rural populations as that Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, Toronto, Ontario W. Z. CONCO, M.B., D.T.M. &amp; H., Resident in Psychiatry difficulties of effective communication may be exerting weight on the proverbial iceberg so that it sinks. As pointed out by Sartwell,2 a communication problem is inherent in epidemiol?gica! studies. Measurements of morbid ity, prevalence and incidence, and mortality rates form the main data of epidemiology; but whether the study is prospective and population-based, retrospective, or a cross-sectional survey, consisting of the application of diagnostic procedures to mem bers of a population to detect cases, there is always a com munication factor, as so well stated by Burton:3 "In order to reach a chosen group of the population we need to know the communication patterns used by that group and, if possible, the importance the group attaches to particular modes of communication.. .. Those we wish to reach are often the most inaccessible." Defects in Surveys Sartwell2 identified three major defects and limitations of surveys. The population is rarely representative, since some individuals are unwilling to participate or are simply unavail able; cases identified in a survey are a biased sample, since the most chronic cases stand the greatest chance of inclusion; and, finally, cases receiving treatment elsewhere are usually not in cluded in a survey. In developing countries a large proportion of patients (if not the majority) receive medical care from tradi tional healers because of various obstacles to attendance at a clinic, hospital, or health centre (if these facilities are there at all). Most studies on the prevalence of ischaemic heart disease in Southern Africa4-7 have taken the view summarized by Schrire:5 "It has long been observed that a profound racial difference in the prevalence of heart disease existed in Southern Africa." The major criticism of these prevalence studies is that while they are informed conjectures they are not at all representative</page><page sequence="2">332 BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL 11 AUGUST 1973 of the population surveyed. They do not take into account the African rural peasants, who have so many communication barriers to consulting a Western doctor. Ischaemic heart disease does occur in the African. 9~13 Even in the remote rural areas I saw Africans not only with coronary heart disease but also with nearly 58% of the conditions listed by Burkitt1 and 66% of those listed by Gelfand14 as rare; and I had no specialized diag nostic facilities such as x-rays or E.C.G.s. I could not afford these and my patients were poor. Sudden death from coronary artery disease is reported as relatively rare in the African,15-17 but Wood18 estimates that 10% of all patients who survive long enough to be admitted die of ventricular fibrillation. Moreover, Yater et al.19 reported in a series of 866 cases that 16% died at once and another 10% within 15 minutes, and none of these cases would have time to be admitted; and in rural Africa they are not even reported to the coroner. In the rural populations of Africa generally deaths are not registered at all. The relation between a disease?for example, coronary heart disease?and an attribute such as chest pain was shown sche matically by Sartwell.2 The most important factors influencing results in this scheme are communication factors accentuating the attribute or obscuring it. Individuals may be divided into those with low pain tolerance (whites) and those with high pain toler ance (rural Africans). If whites and urban Africans with a changing pattern of disease, as observed by Bremmer,20 say, have a low pain tolerance they will have a high incidence and a high attack rate. Conversely, persons with a "less characteristic"21 or a high pain tolerance (rural Africans) will fall into a group not having the attribute, giving a low incidence and a low attack rate. In summary, then, it is possible that the apparent rarity of some diseases in tropical countries may be due to fundamental communication problems ; that the incidence of geographically related diseases is "apparent" in areas where communications are known to be poor with none or inadequate health services, in men, money, and materials; that the remarkable chronological relation to the process of economic development is perhaps a product of improved communications in most dimensions, social, educational, cultural, etc. ; and that the logic of epidemiological design entails, a priori, communication factors in the studies of incidence and prevalence. Problems of Medical Communication Understanding of the problems of communication in the rural African setting may be helped by the concept I have identified of four universes, adopting the first three from a format of essentialism from Popper.22 Universe of Essential Reality?the rural populations in Africa and diseases in their natural geographical environment; an aspect under the general communication problem. Universe of Observable Phenomena?(a) what we observe as medical practitioners, public health administrators, medical research scientists, and epidemiologists; (b) what the people living in these geographical rural areas observe in their various capacities in the traditional set-up: ordinary individuals, tra ditional doctors. Universe of Descriptive Language or Symbolic Representation? (a) the descriptive language of scientific medicine and other symbolic representations; (b) the descriptive language and symbolic representations of traditional African medicine (see table III). Universe of Theoretical Formulations.?The medical scientist aims at finding a true theory or description of disease patterns which will also be an explanation of observable facts : (a) the theoretical formulations of scientific medicine; (b) the theoreti cal formulations of African traditional medical beliefs and practices. The interrelationship of the four universes, as it were, forms a circle of communications as shown in diagram. Universe of Essential Reality Universe of Theoretical Formulations Are our observations a true reflection of reality ? Universe of Observable phenomena Information transmission of meaning Universe of Descriptive Language and Symbolic Representation LANGUAGE USED My experiences23 in simple general practice among rural Africans (mainly Zulus) in South Africa, where medical com munication was in the Zulu language, led me to describe a pattern of the language of disease used and a theory underlying the practice of a system of traditional medicine. The theory recog nizes two forms of disease : natural, ordinary diseases of common causation, and unnatural diseases of anthropomorphic causation where there is a background of religious beliefs. Natural, ordin ary, and common diseases are generally accepted as within the province of the Western doctor, whereas unnatural diseases form the preserve of the traditional doctors. Western doctors are believed to know nothing about unnaturally caused diseases, known as "African diseases," and they therefore may never see some of these cases. Elsewhere24 25 I pointed out that various health agencies are invariably dealing with "selected popula tions" from the general population; that such a selection is in terms of people's beliefs and that the population may be divided into three groups: (1) hospital, clinic, health centre oriented; (2) traditional doctor oriented; and (3) certain re ligious populations who believe in divine faith healing and are in neither of the first two groups. Even the group 1 patients come and go, raising problems of non-cooperation. Communication is essentially the art of using symbols to inform, to formulate, or to express; and the form and structure of language and its manipulation may disclose fundamental limitations in medical communications with rural, non-literate populations. table I?Proportion of English Medical Terms capable of Translation into Zulu System Total No. of English Terms Possible Trans lations into Zulu No. Exact Trans lations into Zulu No. Obstetrics. 30 Alimentary .. .. .. | 100 Infectious diseases and locomotion i 60 Genitourinary .. .. 52 Respiratory .. .. 56 Cardiovascular . . .. ! 90 Disorders of metabolism ' 11 26 54 33 23 23 21 3 86-6 540 550 44-2 41 0 23-3 27-2 13 31 18 12 7 6 0 43-3 310 300 230 12-5 6-6 0 All Systems 399 183 45-8 21-8 In table I, I have summarized the degree of translatability of scientific medical English terms to Zulu, according to various systems, as a measure of communication. The possible or loose translations may, of course, represent subjective or conven tional connotations as used by individual translators in a particular area. Exact translations require that the two terms correspond over the whole range of properties or attributes possessed by the concepts to which the terms are applied. Table I shows that the cardiovascular system has a com munication potential of 6%. In practice I found it extremely difficult to convey the notion of a failing heart and high blood pressure though I tried all tricks of translation. The implica</page><page sequence="3">BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL 11 AUGUST 1973 333 tions of this observation are (1) that African Zulu medicine has no clear concepts or precise terms for the anatomy or physiology of the cardiovascular system; (2) that Zulu descriptive terms of cardiac phenomena may therefore refer vaguely to subjective symptoms generally referred to the chest; "ihlaba" = stabbing table ii?Meanings of Conventional Zulu Terms Conventional Zulu Terms Possible Translation Conventional English Terms Mkhuhlane Ithwabe Umpenge, unkonkonko Amankiwane, uzagiga Inyoni Inyamazane Impehlwa Isilumo Ukhwekhwe Isifubo somoya Inyongo Isifuba sedliso Isithuthwane Izilwane Idolobha Isisu segazi Isilonda Isiyezi, isanxi Ukuhlahla ingozi Iphika Bird; caused by birds Neonatal condition Biliousness, dizziness, dyspnoea, headaches Chronic chest condition Town disease Ordinary common ailment Hiccough Whooping cough Mumps Plantar warts Dysmenorrhoea Scabies Asthma Bile Pulmonary T.B.

Plague Burkitt's list (except obesity) Gelfand's list Mkhuhlane Various terms Various terms pain, "Isibhobo" = constant pain, and sometimes the patient may present with "inyongo", the bile syndrome26; and (3) that patients with mild ischaemic heart disease or silent myocardial infarction are not only likely to be missed but they may never even visit a Western doctor, and, moreover, the rurals generally have a very high pain tolerance. Three patterns of communication in the universe of de scriptive language and symbolic representation are summarized in tables II-IV, showing various degrees or depths of meaningful translation in English and Zulu. These patterns are as follows. (1) A conventional language of disease, as shown in table II, where measles, whooping cough, worms, epilepsy, etc. are con ventional terms used in any society in talk about these generally known conditions. We are not likely to miss these. (2) A scientific language of disease, as shown in table IV, where there is a barrier or gap to effective communication; in this category fall Burkitt's1 and Gelfand's14 lists. Infectious fevers are summarily referred to as "mkhuhlane" in Zulu. (3) An unscientific language of disease and symbolic repre sentations of African traditional medicine, as shown in table III, where Zulu medical terms have a subjective, connotative meaning, as used by traditional doctors and their clients. Finally, as so weU pointed by Newell and Wessen,27 the gen eral principle being stressed here is that research on the epidemiology and control of disease depends on an intimate knowledge of the interaction patterns and life styles of affected populations, including their vital statistics.
