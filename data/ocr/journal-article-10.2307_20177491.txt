Brown1 2 Ethnoarchaeological observations at Maya shrines on a sacred mountain suggest that three potent material strategies imbue ritual practices with different social meanings: 1) the use of different types of materials as offerings in various rites, 2) the ways in which the physical conditions of an offering are altered during deposition, and 3) the choice of location where the offering is deposited within the site relative to a ceremonial focal point. Through these strategies, individuals cre atively negotiate limited access to material resources and assign diverse meanings to the material culture, practices, and places of ritual Materials that represent commoners' rituals may primarily consist of quotidian items that are transformed in meaning by how and where they are deposited into an archaeological context. KEY WORDS: Maya; ritual; sacred sites; cultural formation processes. For contemporary Maya ritual practitioners of the rites known as costumbres, or the old customs, the earth is a sacred animate deity personified in Spanish as Dios Mundo ("Earth Lord"). Reflecting this perspective, certain natural places are known to be enchanted and possess inherent ritual power that facilitates communi cation between humans and the powers-that-be. Some of the most potent places in contemporary Maya highlands are mountaintops and mountaintop shrines known throughout the area (e.g., Bunzel, 1952; Carlsen, 1997; Colby and Colby, 1981; La Farge, 1947; La Farge and Byers, 1931; Navarrete, 1974; Oakes, 1951; Rodas et al, 1940; Schultze, 1954; Tedlock, 1982; Thompson, 1970;Tozzer, 1907,1941; Vogt, 1969, 1976, 1981; Wisdom, 1940). department of Anthropology, The George Washington University, Washington, DC. 2To whom correspondence should be addressed at Hortense Amsterdam House, 2110 G Street, NW, Washington, DC; e-mail: labrown@gwu.edu. 31 1072-5369/04/0300-0031/0 ? 2004 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">32 Brown Pacific Ocean Fig. 1. Map of the Maya area showing the location of the highlands. In this article, I focus on a sacred mountain located in the K'iche' Maya region of the Guatemalan highlands (Fig. 1). Employing anonymity to protect the people with whom I worked, I shall call this mountain "El Duende." El Duende is considered to be a particularly powerful mountain and is actively used for ritual by people throughout the highlands. Similar to other sacred mountains in this region, El Duende is the location of a series of outdoor shrines at its summit, as well as at rock outcrops and rock shelters along its slopes. El Duende is particularly interesting from an ethnoarchaeological perspective because certain shrines are associated with very different types of ceremonial endeavors, including those for attracting desirable things to a person and those for causing death to one's enemies via a ceremony known as the mal entierro, or evil burial. The question arises as to why specific locations within a single site are chosen for one type of ritual practice over another? What makes one place suitable for ritual acts to cause death to enemies versus another place appropriate for rituals that bring luck, money, and other good fortune from the deities? Are there offerings</page><page sequence="3">Dangerous Places and Wild Spaces 33 that are specific to one rite versus the other? How does the treatment of objects (burying, burning, or smashing) affect the meaning of the rite? Approaching sacred sites from an ethnoarchaeological perspective allows us to understand the ways individuals actively use material culture to inscribe mean ing to ritual practices and places. Insights gained for studying the materiality of modern Maya ritual have implications for archaeologists interested in interpret ing commoner ritual from the archaeological record. For example, scholars have argued that Classic Period Maya rulers controlled status-enhancing ceremonial goods to create and replicate supernatural sanctions for their privileged positions (e.g., Demarest, 1992; Freidel, 1981, 1986,1992; Freidel etal, 1993; Freidel and Schele, 1988a,b; Hirth, 1992; Schele, 1985; Schele and Freidel, 1990; Schele and Miller, 1986). However, most people did (and do) not belong to an elite or upper class. If commoners could not access elite ceremonial items, then what strategies and material culture did they use to imbue ritual acts with power and social sig nificance? To address these issues, I argue that practice theory, combined with material and spatial approaches, are valuable tools for archaeologists interested in interpreting rituals of the commoners from the archaeological record. Using the ritual technology of contemporary Maya cermonialism at shrines on El Duende, I describe features and materials associated with different types of ceremonies as well as the condition of objects entering archaeological contexts during these rites. Additionally, I consider the internal spatial organization of sites and features used for different rituals. Finally, I explore how the contemporary Maya, who belong to a poor underclass with limited material resources, creatively use space and material culture to imbue places and practices with diverse meanings. TOWARDS A MATERIAL APPROACH TO RITUAL PRACTICE Studies focusing on ancient commoners constitute an expanding area of inter est for Maya archaeologists (e.g., Sheets, 1992, 2002; Webster and Gonlin, 1988; Wilk and Ashmore, 1988). Scholars striving to balance an elite-centric perspec tive common in twentieth century Maya archaeology have used ethnoarchaeology to focus on various aspects of contemporary rural life (e.g., Deal, 1983, 1985, 1998; Hayden and Cannon, 1983, 1984; Hayden and Deal, 1987; Smyth, 1991; Thompson, 1958). Although ritual activities are believed to show some continuity from Pre-Columbian times to the present (e.g, Hayden and Cannon, 1984, p. 2), contemporary Maya shrines have received little research from a material perspec tive, with the exception of a few studies (e.g., Lothrop, 1926; 1933, pp. 81-83; McDougall, 1946). In part, this gap may reflect the turbulent decades of the 36-year long civil war in Guatemala, where most of the active Maya outdoor shrines are located. During the height of violence in the 1980s and into the early 1990s, local people simply did not venture into the countryside to visit these sites because these areas were strongholds for government or rebel troops (Robert Carlsen, personal communication, 1999). Research focusing on rural shrine sites during these times</page><page sequence="4">34 Brown would have been impossible. However, the lack of ethnoarchaeological research on Maya ritual places arguably also is the byproduct of a Western intellectual tradi tion that regards ritual as a system of belief (Walker, 1995). While elite Maya sites offer epigraphy and abundant sources of iconography for symbolic explorations into past belief systems, commoner sites typically lack these kinds of data. Until recently, research into the ritual activities of commoners generally seemed beyond the scope of Americanist archaeology. In this article, I examine ritual from the perspective of practice theory (e.g., Bell, 1992; Bourdieu, 1977), focusing on the material and spatial aspects of con temporary ritual practice. In practice theory, ritual is defined as a specific form of action by which people strategically distinguish certain practices in relation to more quotidian activities (Bell, 1992, p. 74). In keeping with Giddens' (1994, p. 69) notion of structuration, Bell (1992, p. 74) uses the term ritualization to refer to "culturally specific strategies for setting some activities off from others, for creating and privileging a qualitative distinction between the 'sacred' and the 'profane'" These culturally specific strategies include the use of a "ritual technol ogy" encompassing physical features and offerings that are amenable to material studies (Walker, 1995). In viewing contemporary ritual practice from a material vantage point, I argue that objects entering archaeological contexts at sacred sites do more than demarcate a distinction between the "sacred" and "profane." Decisions concerning the types of offerings appropriate for sacrifice, how these offerings are deposited, and the spatial location of offerings relative to a sacred topographic feature are intimately linked to the emic purpose of the rite. Thus, in addition to the importance of nonmaterial ceremonial performance (such as gesture, words, and song) that imbue significance to ceremonial acts, an ethnoarchaeological perspective reveals that ritual practitioners engender vastly different meanings to specific rites through very material routes. In this article, I argue that three activities are key for the construction of social meaning and achieving the desired outcomes of rites performed at El Duende. These include: 1) the types of materials used as offerings, 2) the ways an offering is deposited, and 3) choosing the location of the deposit within the site. By engaging in these activities, ritual practitioners actively create the desired result and function of the ceremony. Importantly for archaeologists, a practitioner's choices concerning the offerings, depositional style, and a deposit's location create the meaning of the rite, as well as specific types of material signatures that may be recognizable in archaeological contexts after site abandonment. The Life History of Sacred Objects Scholars interested in material culture studies have focused on the relation ships between objects, their life histories, and avenues by which objects (and</page><page sequence="5">Dangerous Places and Wild Spaces 35 their holders) are infused with ritual power and bestowed a sacred status (e.g., Appadurai, 1986; Brown, 2000; Geary, 1986;Kopytoff, 1986; Walker, 1995,1998). From the perspective of behavioral archaeology, an object's life history refers to the unique trajectory an object follows from initial creation or acquisition through its uses and eventual disposal when it enters an archaeological context (Schiffer, 1972). Archaeologists interested in interpreting ritual from archaeological re mains have noted that objects used in ceremonies often have distinctive "ritual life-histories" and follow restricted trajectories from manufacture, use, reuse to eventual disposal (Walker, 1995, 1998) and, at times, re-entry into a use context as sacra (Brown, 2000). Thus, Walker (1995, 1998) argues that the life history of an object may be one of the most important units of analysis for identifying ritual technologies of the past. Similarly, scholars interested in how places acquire sym bolic and ritual meaning over time have found it fruitful to consider the long-term life history of a particular structure or topographic place in the landscape (e.g., Ashmore, 2002; McAnany, 1995, 1998). Paralleling this focus is scholarship emerging from material studies in which objects-in-motion, things circulating in networks of social and power relations, provide an entr?e into understanding how "human actors encode things with sig nificance" (Appadurai, 1986, p. 5). For example, Kopytoff (1986) proposed that objects are assigned a "sacred" value by being singularized, a process that involves prohibiting or restricting their exchange value as commodities. Singularized ob jects, such as shell armbands and bracelets in the Trobriand kula ring (Malinowski, 1961), Navajo sacred bundles (Frisbie, 1987), or Medieval saints' relics in Europe (Geary, 1986), are made powerful in part because they stand in contrast with commodities that can be exchanged freely and move readily throughout society (Kopytoff, 1986). These studies emphasize how portable objects are imbued with power vis ?-vis their actual circulation, or lack thereof, within various social networks. As we shall see, for contemporary Maya ritual practitioners an object's social meaning and ritual status sometimes is acquired through actions it undergoes during the last phase of its life history, when "things-in-motion" (Appadurai, 1986, p. 5) become things-in-rest in archaeological contexts. RITUAL TECHNOLOGY: FEATURES, MATERIALS, AND DEPOSITION3 All shrine sites on El Duende have features used for making sacrificial of ferings to the deities. Sacrificial offerings consist of items that are still useable in 3 This article is based on fieldwork I conducted in June 2000 and July 2001. Methods included mapping each shrine site, observing ceremonies at these sites, conducting informal interviews with ritual participants and practitioners, and cross-checking information about ceremonias blancas, ceremonias negras, and mal entierros with individuals in other K'iche' communities (Brown, 2002). The map</page><page sequence="6">36 Brown other contexts?objects that are new or still have considerable use life before they would otherwise be discarded?that are deposited at sacred sites with the goal of bringing about a desired ceremonial result (Walker, 1995, p. 76). Three distinct types of ritual features are used for sacrificial offerings at El Duende: 1) the tabal, or altar, 2) the porobal, or sacrificial offering hearth, and 3) the mal entierro, or evil burial. The Tabal The tabal, or altar, is the first place a ritual practitioner approaches when arriving at a sacred site on El Duende. It can consist of an unmodified natural feature, such as a flat-topped boulder or alcove in a rock, or a constructed feature such as a rock alignment or platform. Regardless of the type, upon arrival at the site the ritual practitioner first approaches this feature to give a short greeting to the deities and asks permission to conduct a ceremony. After this, she/he will begin to prepare the area by cleaning any dead offerings from the surface of the tabal and decorating the feature with fresh flowers, pine needles, and various ritual offerings to make it appealing to the deities. The most common sacrificial offering associated with the tabal is the candle. Burning candle offerings is an essential part of all postcolonial Maya ritual, and the candles themselves are often conceived of as tortillas, chicken, or beef for the gods (Vogt, 1976, p. 50). In addition, ritual participants deposit various kinds of unburned offerings on this feature, the overwhelming majority of which are organic products. Food offerings are routinely presented and left on the tabal Generally, sweet items are preferred such as chocolate, fruits, sweet breads, candy, and cookies. Libations consisting of bootleg rum or beer may be left in ceramic vessels or poured directly of the feature and the ground around it, and opened cans of fruit juice and bottles of soda pop are often placed here. In addition to offerings, the tabal may incorporate important symbolic items such as crosses, archaeological sculptures, or anthropomorphic concretions. In some shrines, animal skulls are found andredeposited archaeological objects (such work was accomplished with the help of a local K'iche' research assistant familiar with costumbres, the use of ceremonial space at the local shrines, and knowledge about the encantos associated with these places. All shrines on El Duende Mountain are open to the public and visited by many noncommunity members; thus, physical access to these sites was not restricted. I observed portions of or complete rituals for more than 30 ceremonies at shrines near the top of the mountain. However, due to the risk of robberies, I did not have the same opportunity to observe ceremonies at shrines located lower on the mountain in more remote areas. Darkness is considered auspicious for certain types of ceremonies, especially those associated with ceremonias negras. My ability to observe ceremonies at night on the mountain was restricted due to safety concerns; as a result, all ceremonies I observed occurred during the day. On these occasions, I recorded the shrines and offerings where people conducted ceremonias blancas and negras. I never observed a ceremony where a mal entierro was buried and was told this mainly occurred at night. However, I did take part in a healing ceremony to recover and deactivate a burial.</page><page sequence="7">Dangerous Places and Wild Spaces 37 as ceramic sherds, ground stone, ballgame yokes, and sculpture) are present. Addi tionally, any personal sacra brought to the site for use during the ceremony, such as divination equipment, are displayed on the tabal for the duration of the ceremony. All sacrificial offerings left at the tabal are deposited on the surface of the feature or its base. The candle is the only offering that is intentionally burned at on this feature. All other offerings are left on the tabal in an unburned state. The Porobal The porobal, or sacrificial offering heath, is a specialized feature used solely for burning offerings to the deities. The act of burning offerings is integral part of ritual at contemporary K'iche' shrines (e.g., Bunzel, 1952, p. 431; Chiappari, 1999, p. 40; Cook, 1986, p. 139; 2000, p. 267; Tedlock, 1982, pp. 66-73). In the rituals I observed, the majority of time at any rite was spent constructing and then carefully tending a sacrificial offering fire, and most offerings deposited at shrines enter an archaeological context as burned remains in these hearths. The importance of burning offerings is mirrored in the language used to refer to costumbres. For example, when the K'iche' inquire as to whether one performs constumbre rituals, it is customary to ask "Do you burn?" The rituals themselves are called "burnings" (Cook, 1986, p. 139), and the ritual site itself is often referred as a porobal or "a place or thing used for burning" (Cook, 2000, p. 270). For Maya ritual practioners, the act of burning is key to rites. It transforms the copal incense, blood, chocolate, chili, tallow, rum, sweet bread, or tobacco into smoke, thereby rendering it into a state appropriate for consumption by the deities. Thus, by burning offerings, ritual participants "feed" the deities, offering them aromatic items and enticing them into a relationship based on ritual reciprocity and commensality in this "rite of exchange" (sensu Bell, 1997, p. 108). When a ritual practitioner constructs an offering mound at El Duende, he or she first defines the area of the hearth by pouring sugar on the ground in the shape of a circle. This circle, sometimes referred to as the mesa, or table, is where the deities will come to "eat" the sacrificial offerings provided. After defining the boundary, the ritual practitioner begins to pile up the mound of materials to be burned. A wide variety of items are offered, including copal incense, which is viewed as the tortillas, beans, and tamales of the deities (Chiappari, 1999, p. 135). The lower level of the offering mound contains candles or ocote pitch pine, and the bulk of the offerings are stacked on top of this fuel-rich base. Rower and food offerings are included in the heap, and libations in ceramic vessels may be placed within the mound or poured into the fire once ignited. Finally, blood from any animal sacrificed at the site is scattered over the top of the constructed mound, and the carcass may be heaped on top of the pyre. At the sites on El Duende, sacrificial offering hearths are associated with two broad categories of postcolonial ritual practices referred to as ceremonias blancas</page><page sequence="8">38 Brown ("white ceremonies") and ceremonias negras ("black ceremonies") in Spanish. The term ceremonias blancas is used for a variety of rites performed to attract desirable things to a person, such as luck, love, bountiful harvest, money, and business. Ceremonias negras include a suite of ritual practices generally designed to rid a person of undesirable influences, such as bad luck, troubles with neigh bors, ghost sickness, or illness resulting from brujer?a ("sorcery" or "witchcraft"). Additionally, ceremonias negras may include rituals for causing illness, harm, and death to others or returning a curse back to the sender. At El Duende, some ceremonies included both types of offering hearths. In these instances, the first offering hearth was used for a ceremonia blanca, while the second was associated with a ceremonia negra. While some offerings made during these two ceremonies were the same materials, others were specific to one versus the other, making it possible to distinguish between them based on the identification of materials entering the archaeological context (Table I). In general, offerings associated with ceremonias blancas contained sweet items and flowery Table I.

In comparison, offerings used in ceremonias negras contained pungent, spicy, or strong offerings designed to expel problems. Remains associated with sacrificial offering hearths have a distinctive mate rial signature that makes them recognizable and distinguishable from other ritual offering features on El Duende. The majority of offerings are organic remains, including flowers, plants, incense, food, and the blood and carcasses of sacrificial animals. Additionally, various types of inorganic materials may be included. In contrast with the materials deposited at the tabal, all materials entering archaeo logical contexts via sacrificial offering hearths are burned. Sacrificial offering hearths also are distinguishable from cooking hearths at sacred sites. Examination of 400 hearths at Maya shrines demonstrated that offering and cooking hearths are conceptually separate and functionally discrete features that leave distinct material signatures in the archaeological record (Brown, 2002). Field identification of observable charred remains allowed me to identify 73 different materials in sacrificial offering hearths including botanical, animal, and inorganic remains (Brown, 2002, p. 101). In contrast, cooking hearths overwhelm ingly consist of burned wood fuel with only six other types of material identified, and these only occasionally noted. Additionally, there is a notable difference in the degree of compaction in ma terials entering archaeological contexts via cooking or offering hearths. Typically, carbonized remains in cooking hearths are not densely compacted; they consist of loose ash and small fragments of charred wood. Conversely, remains in offering hearths are quite compacted because they are embedded in dense matrix of burned blood, tree resins, sugar, and animal tallow or paraffin. Thus, the types of material present and the degree of compaction could be useful for distinguishing between these two features after site abandonment. The Mal Entierro The final type of ritual offering feature noted at El Duende is the mal entierro or the "evil burial." The mal entierro consists of a ritual during which certain kinds of objects are buried in the ground with the goal of causing illness and death to a person via a magical attack (Brown, 2002, pp. 128-134; Bunzel, 1952, pp. 386 388; Cabairus, 1998, p. 74; Cosminsky, 1972, pp. 122-123; Oakes, 1951, p. 122, pp. 166-169; Redfield and Villa Rojas, 1934, p. 179; Rodas et al, 1940, p. 73; Saler, 1967, p. 89; Vogt, 1969, pp. 411-412; Watanabe, 1992, pp. 191-192). The K'iche' and Tz'utjil Maya associate the mal entierro with a ritual practitioner known as the aj'itz, a man or a woman who is commonly believed to be a "witch" (e.g., Carlsen and Prechtel, 1994; Cook, 2000; Saler, 1967) Highland Maya peoples typically regard evil burials as malicious unprovoked attacks by unscrupulous ritual practitioners. However, mal entierro also may be done to cure and counter the effects of an unjustified evil burial by "throwing</page><page sequence="10">40 Brown the sickness back on the attacker" (Oakes, 1951, p. 168) and "asking for justice" (Bunzel, 1952, pp. 386-388), thereby protecting a client who is under the influ ence of such an assault. These oppositional purposes expose the moral ambiguity inherent in this ritual practice. As La Farge noted in the town of Santa Eulalia, "sorcery is accepted as a necessary evil, but it is not condoned" (1947, p. 150). The most common offering associated with the mal entierro is an anthropo morphic figure of the victim rendered in copal, wax, clay, cloth, or meat (Brown, 2002, pp. 128-134; Bunzel, 1952, pp. 386-388; Cabarrus, 1998, p. 74; Cosminsky, 1972, pp. 122-123; Oakes, 1951, p. 122, pp. 166-169; Redfield and Villa Rojas, 1934, p. 179; Rodas et al, 1940, p. 73; Saler, 1967, p. 89; Vogt, 1969, pp. 411-412; Watanabe, 1992, pp. 191-192). These figurines may be "dressed" in clothing, they may have hair from the victim adhered to them, and they are generally stuck with pins, thorns, or glass shards to throw illness into the victim's body prior to their burial (Table H). In addition to anthropomorphic figures, certain kinds of animals may be sacrificed and buried in the pit, especially those species associated with dangerous poisons, such as snakes or toads (Oakes, 1951, pp. 160-161). Sometimes, large masses of melted candle wax with inclusions of chili and other substances are interred (Brown, 2002). Rotten animal fat might be placed in the pit and salt used to dry up the path of the victim, thereby causing animals, corn fields, and the victim to wither away (e.g., Brown, 2002; Carlsen and Prechtel, 1994). Some ritual practitioners collect a small number of human bone fragments from the back dirt of a freshly dug grave and re-inter these in the mal entierro (Bunzel, 1952, pp. 368-388). Oakes (1951, p. 162) recorded a mal entierro placed in a damp spot with a large stone sealing and capping the feature. In addition to the burial pit, activity areas used for the mal entierro often have sacrificial hearths with associated artifacts scattered on the ground and in the nearby midden. Artifacts recorded in these areas include burned garlic, limes, cigarettes, eggs, rue, copal, chili, and ocote pine pitch used for starting fires (Brown, 2002). Caps from rum bottles, beer bottle glass, hard candy wrappers, ceramic sherds, black candles, and red and green sugar were noted. Additionally, commercially produced perfumes and oil bottles were discarded in these areas, including San Alejo ("Saint Alejo") used to getting rid of problems with bad neighbors, Tapa Boca ("to close the mouth") to close the mouth of one's enemies, and Agua de Retiro ("retirement" or "withdrawal water") for returning witchcraft to the sender and/or causing death. Materials placed in the mal entierro may be smashed as they are deposited into the ground (Bunzel, 1952, pp. 386-388). As a consequence, unmodified stones or expedient stone tools also may be present in these areas. This practice is described in the following account by a ritual practitioner in Chichicastenango: I take the dust [small human bone fragments from back dirt of freshly dug grave] and the candle in the little box, and a stone as large as I am able to carry. I have selected this, and</page><page sequence="11">Dangerous Places and Wild Spaces 41 Table II.

I look carefully to see whether the candle is completely buried in the earth; if not I cover it over well so that no one may see it. Bunzel (1952, pp. 386-388)</page><page sequence="12">42 Brown Therefore, materials included in the mal entierro enter an archaeological context differently than all other offerings deposited at El Duende as they are buried. Interred objects may include items unique to this rite, such as images of the intended victim, as well as typical ritual offerings, such as candles and copal. Generally, when candles and copal are included in a mal entierro, they may be only partially burned, smashed (see also Bringhurst, 1986, p. 454), or interred completely unburned (Brown, 2002). EMBODIED SPACES Relationships between space, local topography, and social meaning have been of recent interest to archaeologists concerned with the significance of natural places, such as caves, rock outcrops, and mountaintops (e.g., Ashmore, 2002; Ashmore and Knapp, 1999; Bradley, 2000; Brady, 1997; Brown, 2002). At the shrines on El Duende, decisions concerning the use of space are linked to con structs associated with the human body. Practitioners of costumbres often view unusual rock formations as petrified ancestral deities and spirits (e.g., Tedlock, 1985, p. 51; Vogt, 1976, p. 130, 133). Subsequently, symbolism associated with the human body is projected upon embodied ancestral rock outcrops and informs the use of space at shrines Ethnographers have noted that the human body constitutes one of the most fundamental spatial domains for the Maya (e.g., Carlsen and Prechtel, 1994; Earle, 1986; Hanks, 1984; Tedlock, 1982). In a linguistic study with contempo rary Yucatec Maya, Hanks (1984) notes that terms for bodily orientation serve as metaphors for spatial orientation by reference to three paired oppositions: front/back, right/left, and up/down. When applied to the human body, the front/back dichotomy "is grounded in the visual field and normal forward locomotion," while right/left is viewed as "to my right" or "to my left," and up/down refers to "the space above and below a person in normal upright orientation" (Hanks, 1984, p. 90). Hanks (1984, p. 90) argues that the vertical coordinate of up/down is the orientation most "systemically encoded in the cosmological premises and dis course forms of Maya shamans, where higher always implies more powerful and beneficial" and down refers to wild and dangerous spaces and/or deceptive prac tices. Similarly, back refers to "dangerous, hidden, oppressing, while things in front are more likely to be benevolent, honest, and in clear view" (Hanks, 1984, p. 91). Thus, moral significance is placed upon these spatial orientations; up, front, and right are associated with positive phenomena and the coordinates of down, back, and left are associated with negative phenomena, or anger and "sinister" qualities (Hanks, 1990, pp. 90-91). Scholars working in the Maya highlands (e.g., Earle, 1986; Gossen, 1974, 1979; Tedlock, 1982; Vogt, 1976) have noted the importance of incorporating both binary opposites.

Beaubien. walk with a balance of the left and right sides" (Carlsen and Prechtel, 1994, p. 99), whereas illness is a symptom of being out of balance with respect to these symbolic complexes. To demonstrate the interrelationships between the body and cultural perception, Carlsen and Prechtel (1994, p. 84) presented a model illustrating how the body literally serves as a map infused with social and cosmological significance (Fig. 2). In a corporeally grounded cartography, the middle of the body is associated with the equinoxes and the east-west path of the sun during these times. The two sides of the body represent the constantly changing binary forces that comprise all existence (e.g., Carlsen and Prechtel, 1994). The right side of the body is associated with the sun, day, male, the rainy season, life, the waking state, and the direction north; the left side of the body is associated with the moon, night, female, the dry season, death, the dreaming state, and the direction south (Carlsen and Prechtel, 1994, p. 84). Similar associations are noted for contemporary K'iche' day-keepers (Earle, 1986, p. 164; Tedlock, 1982, pp. 140-141) and the Tzotzil Maya in Chiapas</page><page sequence="14">44 Brown (e.g., Gossen, 1979; Vogt, 1976). Although the left symbolic complex is viewed as inherently dangerous, Carlsen and Prechtel (1994, p. 97) note that the "right without the left is abnormal, even pathological." Scholars also have noted the importance the Maya place on the conceptual dichotomy between center and periphery (e.g., Gillespie and Joyce, 1998; Gossen, 1974; Hanks, 1990; Watanabe, 1992). The center is linked to the town and the concepts of order, harmony, and safety. The periphery is linked with the forest and wildness, disharmony, and danger. In this dyad, the periphery is mistrusted and considered delicate, because it is associated with the edge of the universe and antisocial forces and beings (Gossen, 1986, p. 230). All of these spatial referents and their social and moral attributes inform decisions as to what particular place is suitable for a specific type of ritual practice. When Ancestral Spirits Inhabit Rocks As noted above, the human body "is used by the Maya as a spatial referent with regards to fixed things" (Earle, 1986, p. 163). But what happens when "fixed things," such as volcanic geological formations, are themselves animate living forces possessing their own "owners," or guardians, and encantos ("spirits") who are capable of moving around at night and appearing to individuals in the form of a midwife, a toad, or a camera-carrying gringo? To understand how ritual practice is organized relative to an animated outcrop one needs to place oneself in the footsteps of the ancestors/spirits who are embodied in stone. Similar to the human body, the ancestral spirits inhabit three-dimensional physical space. Thus, spatial understandings concerning the human body are shared with the ancestral stones at shrine sites (see Fig. 2). At the sacred sites on El Duende, the orientation of the ancestral spirit embodied in the stone takes primacy and serves as the reference point around which ritual practices and features are organized. Iyom The site of "Iyom" ("Midwife") is situated at the base of a rock outcrop with an embodied encanto, or spirit, who appears to living people in the form of a woman. The exposed rock surface follows a linear east-west axis and constitutes the "front" of the deity. Along this surface is a series of narrow unmodified ledges that are seats of power for the encanto, and each has its own ritual function (Fig. 3). The organization of ritual activity pivots on a small standing stone along the outcrop, which is the symbolic middle point of the embodied being. Those seats of power to the left of the center point belong to realm the left symbolic complex; thus, they are associated with curing individuals near death, women, and animals. Those to</page><page sequence="15">Dangerous Places and Wild Spaces 45 Fig. 3. Artist's depiction of the site of Iyom. Illustration by H. Beaubien. the right are associated with attributes belonging in the right symbolic complex, including rain, the harvest, and successful business. Seats of power located in the symbolic middle are dedicated to general curing, consistent with the Maya concept that sickness derives from imbalance either the left or right side of one's being (e.g., Carlsen and Prechtel, 1994, p. 99). Thus, cultural understandings concerning the right and left sides of the human body are projected spatially upon the outcrop. Interestingly, the symbolism of the encanto takes precedence over the symbolism generally linked with the east-west axis; at Iyom the usual attributes of the west (death, women, animals) are associated with the easternmost part of this site and vice versa. The spatial primacy of the embodied outcrop affects where ritual practition ers engage in different rituals at the site, as well as the distribution of material remains associated with those contexts. Ceremonias blancas occur directly in front of the symbolic center point on the outcrop (see Fig. 3), rather than to the left, and ceremonias negras are held to the left of the outcrop rather than the right. DESCRIPTIONS OF SITES WITH ACTIVITY AREAS FOR THE MAL ENTIERRO I now turn to the question of how Maya ritual practitioners view on-site to pography through cultural filters to decide which places are suitable for conducting a mal entierro. I focus on the sites on El Duende with activity areas and features attributable to three types of ceremonies: 1) those used to attract desirable things,</page><page sequence="16">46 Brown 2) those used to expel negative influences, and 3) those used for causing death through the mal entierro. Although ethnographers have reported stories about the mal entierro (e.g., Bunzel, 1952; Cabarrus, 1998; Cosminsky, 1972; Oakes, 1951; Redfield and Villa Rojas, 1934; Rodas ?tal, 1940; Saler, 1967; Vogt, 1969), the social organization of space at places used for such rites has not been recorded. While this practice has been reported to ethnographers, it has not been entirely clear whether the Maya actually performed mal entierros or whether they were a modern rural-myth (Dennis Tedlock, personal communication, 2002). My observations of features associated with this practice, as well as witnessing the recovery of buried objects associated with mal entierros, demonstrate that this ritual practice is performed. El Due?o El Due?o ("The Owner") is situated at the base of several large tumbled volcanic boulders perched on a mountainside overlooking a canyon. The site hosts two main activity areas: an upper and a lower area (Fig. 4). The upper activity area is located at the base of an outcrop associated with an ancestral being. Tumbled boulders form a small natural alcove used by ritual practitioners as a tabal During a ceremony, this alcove is decorated with pine needles and flowers, and ritual participants leave unburned food offerings inside. Additional offerings are left on a stack of unmodified cobblestones at the alcove entrance. Upper ^-^\ I \ SACRED ROCK Activity &lt;. /^V-7 /^X OUTCROP Area W7- f ^ "S w ii ?t/-^ i "- y Lower J?

All three hearths, which are close to the embodied outcrop, are used for burning offerings for ceremonias blancas. Observable burned materials include offerings appropriate to this task, such as copal, sugar, hard candy, sweet bread, chocolate, cookies, and flowers. Near the hearths are empty bottles of sweet smelling perfumed commercial potions designed to attract and entice the deities, such as agua de florida ("flower water"). A bit further down the eroded slope yet within the same activity area are three more sacrificial offering hearths. These hearths are used for rituals to ex pel undesirable things from a person's social sphere, such as problems with bad neighbors or a run of bad luck, or illness caused by envy or brujer?a ("sorcery" or "witchcraft"). Reflecting these functions, burned remains include offerings with strong attributes appropriate to the task, such as burned cigars, chili, limes, garlic, and the strong scented herb called rue. The lower activity area is downslope from the upper zone, on a small earthen ledge. This zone is used for mal entierros. It contains several pit features with freshly turned dirt, suggesting they were used recently in ritual. In the center of the lower activity area there is an open offering hearth used for burning offerings. Burned materials observed in the hearth include those typical of ceremonias ne gras: black candle wax, chili seeds, limes, garlic, caps from rum bottles, ceramic sherds, and ocote pitch pine used as fuel for fires. Empty bottles of commercial potions discarded near the hearth included San Alejo ("Saint Alejo") used for get ting rid of bad neighbors, tapa boca ("close mouth") to silence one's enemies, and agua de retiro ("withdrawal water" or "retirement water") for returning bru jer?a ("sorcery" or "withcraft") to the sender and causing death to enemies. The open offering hearth also had a large unmodified stone placed in its center. As discussed earlier, the location of this stone is consistent with ethnographic re ports that ritual practitioners may use large rocks to smash objects interred during the rite (Bunzel, 1952, pp. 386-388) and, as such, stones can be stored close to a burial pit. Los Encantos The second site with material evidence of mal entierros is Los Encantos ("The Enchanted Ones"). Similar to El Due?o, it contains a rock outcrop that houses an encanto and is perched on a mountainside overlooking a canyon below. Los Encantos has three activity areas along narrow ledges on the side of the mountain (Fig. 5). Activity Area 1 is used exclusively for ceremonias blancas. Offering features include a constructed tabal and a sacrificial offering hearth. The cobblestone tabal is flush against the outcrop and situated up a slight rise so it maintains the highest elevation of all the features at the site.</page><page sequence="18">48 Brown Fig. 5. Artist's depiction of the site of Los Encantos showing activity areas and ritual features. Illustration by H. Beaubien. Activity Area 2 is located southeast of former and at a slightly lower eleva tion. It contains a secondary tabal that consists of an unmodified flat top boulder positioned flush against the outcrop. A single sacrificial offering hearth, used for ceremonias negras, is positioned directly in front of the tabal The area also con tains a pit for mal entierros, which is placed at the periphery of Activity Area 2 near the edge of cliff. Activity Area 3, located in the south eastenmost section of the site, has the lowest elevation of all three areas. This area is used by aj'itz for mal entierros. It incorporates a centrally placed hearth for burning offerings, several discrete pits, and a more generally disturbed area used for burying objects. A large tumbled boulder obscures views of the pit features from Activity Areas 1 and 2, offering some privacy to those using this zone. Los Huesos Los Huesos ("The Bones") is located at the base of an outcrop that embodies an ancestral being. The site contains two main activity areas (Fig. 6). The upper activity area is closest to the rock outcrop. A tabal is located at the base of the outcrop, and several offering hearths are situated on the ground in front of the tabal All offering hearths in proximity to the outcrop are used for ceremonias blancas. A small footpath at the edge of the upper area leads down to the lower activity area, a narrow earthen ledge with a shallow alcove formed by overhanging boulders from above. The interior of the alcove is used for mal entierros. In front of the alcove there is a single sacrificial offering hearth, placed on a flat boulder that precariously hangs over the edge of the steep precipice.</page><page sequence="19">Dangerous Places and Wild Spaces 49 Fig. 6. Artist's depiction of the site of Los Huesos showing activity areas and ritual features. Illustration by H. Beaubien. DEMARCATING MEANING THROUGH SPACE, MATERIAL, AND DEPOSITION What makes one place conducive for conducting ceremonies to attract desir able things to a supplicant and another place appropriate for doing a mal entierro? At the sacred sites on El Duende, the central ceremonial focal point was the ances tral spirit embodied in specific rock outcrops. Thus, the embodied outcrop functions as the spatial pivot around which ritual activities and features are organized. The offering feature consistently located closest to the sacralized topographic feature is the tabal (Fig. 7). In some sites these two features are one and the same, as seen at the site of Iyom where all tabal are constituted by the rock outcrop itself (see Fig. 3). At other sites, the tabal is separate yet constructed flush against the outcrop. Regardless, the tabal is the cultural feature that physically marks the ceremonial focal point of a site. The embodied symbolism and spatial metaphors projected upon the outcrop influence where ritual participants engage in certain kinds of ceremonial activities and thus where certain types of artifacts enter archaeological contexts at these sites. Features associated with ceremonias blancas and ceremonias negras are spatially segregated from one another. While sacrificial offerings for ceremonias blancas are conducted close to the symbolic focal point, those associated with ceremonias negras are placed further away from the outcrop (see Fig. 7).</page><page sequence="20">50 Brown Fig. 7. Schema showing spatial model for where individuals engage in various ritual practices relative to a central ceremonial focal point. The mal entierro is firmly enmeshed in the realm of the left symbolic complex with its association to death and the aj'itz. Thus, the locations that ritual practi tioners select for burials reflect this delicate and marginal status. All areas with evidence of the mal entierro were located at a lower elevation than the ceremonial focal point, which in these sites were rock outcrops hosting encantos. At two sites, the burials were placed in the southernmost part of the site and to the left side of the outcrop. In the third site, the burial was located directly below the ancestral outcrop. Importantly, in all cases, the burials were placed along the periphery of the site itself, with some in physically dangerous locations, such as the edge of cliff (see Figs. 4 &amp; 5), thereby replicating the metaphysical danger in carrying out such delicate work. Decisions about where to engage in various ritual practices at El Duende echo a broader understanding of the body-as-map in which specific spatial concepts are linked with a suite of social and moral constructs, discussed earlier. Yet individuals do more than passively reflect the structure of the social-spatial cosmos in the use of space at sacred sites. In choosing to inter an offering in a location downslope from a sacred outcrop or to burn flowers, chocolate, and sweet bread directly in front of the outcrop, individuals actively create and demarcate a distinction between different kinds of social/ritual space and in the process attempt to intervene and sway the deities through active agency.</page><page sequence="21">Dangerous Places and Wild Spaces 51 The production of social/ritual space at contemporary shrines on El Duende materializes a worldview that may have considerable historical depth in the Maya area. Scholars have remarked that one of the central concepts in Maya religion is that of a divinely ordained dynamic tension that gives rise to the life-giving forces of all existence (see Carmack et al, 1996, pp. 315-316). As noted by Carmack et al (1996, pp. 315-316), this conflict is "primordial, ubiquitous, and easy to rationalize... [and] the parties in conflict are often dual aspects of the same supernatural being, social unit or person." The authors go on to note that: [t]he issue of duality and the subsequent dialog and conflict between these dual principals is indeed the dynamic force that creates the cosmos in the Maya world, ancient and modern. Dennis Tedlock has noted that the peculiar Mesoamerican twist to this idea is not only that this dynamic tension is sacred, but also that it is complementary rather than oppositional, contemporaneous rather than sequential. Carmack et al. (1996, p. 316, emphasis added) The close spatial association between areas used for aj '/??-related ritual prac tices, such as burials, and those used for less antisocial types of ritual requests makes this distinct understanding about the nature of the universe materially vis ible. If tension and conflict between binary opposites is sacred, complementary, and contemporaneous, then ritual practices associated with the left symbolic com plex, even those rites as dangerous as the burial, should be in close proximity to, or incorporated within, a physical locus that also contains features, offerings, and spaces used for ritual requests associated with the right symbolic complex. This was clearly the case in the sites I recorded at El Duende, and with further research we will know whether this pattern holds across a broader area. Ritual practitioners also actively construct meaning through their choices of the types and conditions of offerings deposited. As noted earlier, some were particular to one ceremony or another (see Table I). Sweet smelling items constitute the bulk of the materials burned in ceremonias blancas, following lines of thought reminiscent of "imitative magic" (Frazer, 1963, p. 12), as these attract desirable things to a person. Conversely, pungent or noxious material is included in hearths for ceremonias negras, as these "strong" odors expel negative influences from a person. Meanwhile, in the mal entierro ritual practitioners employ imitative and "contagious magic" (Frazer, 1963, p. 12), as things once in contact with (or part of) individuals maintain a constant connection with them. By interring and smashing deposits, ritual practitioners bury and destroy the enemy, whereas by including pieces of clothing or hair of the intended victim, the ritual practitioner personalizes the rite and directs forces and deities to one particular individual. In addition to the use of materials with specific ceremonial functions, the meaning of a particular ritual was clearly linked to how offerings enter archaeo logical contexts, even if the same material was offered. For example, candles used in a ceremonia blanca are always burned, either as a single offering on the tabal or thrown into the mix of offerings heaped upon a sacrificial offering hearth. Candles</page><page sequence="22">52 Brown can also be used by an aj'itz for a curse, but if they are included in the mal entierro they are generally interred in an unburned state and sometimes smashed. Decisions concerning how objects-in-motion become objects-in-rest in ar chaeological contexts at sacred sites are key in the production of social/ritual space. The act of burning, smashing, or burying a candle is inseparable from im buing ritual practices and ritual places with social meaning and guiding a ceremony to a desired outcome. The following statement clearly shows how emotion (moral indignation) and the emic function of a rite (witchcraft) is conflated with how an object is treated when it enters an archaeological context during a ceremony. Maybe they ["witches"] just burn a lot of candles, that's what it means. Then perhaps they have put the flames of a candle of some fellow man, perhaps they have begun to burn a large amount of pom [copal]. Perhaps they crumble up the candle, then it is scattered... on the ground, that is abominable. That's what that is. I won't do it. That's what they call tulac [malicious incantations]. Bringhurst(1986,p.454) THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF POSTCOLONIAL MAYA RITUAL PRACTICE Given the ritual practices discussed in this article, what archaeological impli cations could we advance to help us understand how commoners in the past may have demarcated space at shrine sites located in natural places? As noted earlier, one of the ways individuals demarcate different types of social spaces is through the spatial location of an offering relative to the animated rock outcrops. Based on contemporary practice, we could propose that geological formations perceived as sacred in the past would likely be "tagged" by the presence of a tabal-like feature(s) where offerings were deposited over time (Fig. 8). The tabal may not only mark the symbolic focus of a given place but could help us understand the overall organiza tion of space if it serves as a metaphorical center-point for sacrificial activities as it does today. Contemporary ritual practice suggests that productive questions to ask include whether the same types of ritual features, materials, and depositional events occurred in various spatial locations, such as the "front" and "back" of the sacred feature? Is there a difference between the types of offerings deposited to its "right" or the "left" side? How did individuals use areas located immediately above or be low the ceremonial focal point? Or is there evidence of distinct types of ritual prac tices occurring close to the feature versus those performed along the site periphery? Another way we might infer the spatial organization of different types of ritual practices is through the types of materials offered. Among the contemporary Maya, some materials burned in offering hearths are specific to the type of rite performed. If abandoned shrines contain evidence of abundant burning, then the identification of carbonized materials in hearths, and mapping their distribution across horizon tal space, may help us identify within site boundaries that past peoples perceived</page><page sequence="23">Dangerous Places and Wild Spaces Twbti cande vox, ritual lymbcls, cluitera of cobblestone* candleholden ROCK OUTCROP SII? iSacrilici?! hearth, carbonized seedi, stems offioweri, henry lugar reiiduei TUMBLED BOULDERS STEEP DROP-OFF can Je wax, ritual symbols, clutters of cobblestone* candleholden ROCK OUTCROP LEGEND X Midden Carbonised chii, tobicco, gprfc. rue, imei Cirbonized chli, tobacco, garie, me, imes Buried offering* pttffciJtur? tallow, parafai, beeswax bouldtr rock outcrop dgaofslopa ffTEEP DROP-OFF Buried offerings Fig. 8.

Ritual technology is not always composed of specialized items like quet zal feathers, jade masks, or fancy polychrome pots, but may consist primarily of "domestic" goods that are identifiable as ritual objects solely because they have unique life histories (Walker, 1995). This seems to be especially true for ritual tech nologies used by commoners who have a limited suite of materials available. On</page><page sequence="24">54 Brown El Duende, the majority of offering deposits included common household items, such as ceramic cups, chili, chocolate, or salt. Yet these domestic items were trans formed in meaning by being destroyed purposefully and/or taken out of a mundane context to the sacred site. Consequently, for archaeological inquiries that focus on the ritual activities of commoners, it may be particularly important not to conflate artifact form with function, because function may be best inferred from contextual evidence, such as spatial location (see Deal, 1988 for a similar interpretation of Maya household altars), or from analyses focusing on its life history. Finally, contemporary Maya ritual practice suggests that when people have limited economic resources, individuals will also assign distinct types of ritual meaning and demarcate different kinds of social space by treating the very same kinds of objects differently. At El Duende, the type of depositional event an object undergoes, such as burning, smashing, or burial, is meaningful and inseparable from the function of the rite. Thus, sorting out what happens to objects when they enter archaeological contexts, and plotting specific types of depositional events across horizontal space at shrines, could expose emically important boundaries that are solely demarcated through the differential treatment of otherwise similar quotidian items. In closing, I would like to emphasize that the active use of the site periphery in contemporary shrines is significant. For the Maya, the periphery serves as both metaphor and the physical location of more marginal and "dangerous" types of ritual practices. Features associated with these practices, such as mal entierros and certain kinds of burned offerings, are constructed in places that could be overlooked by archaeologists focusing on the site core. Contemporary indigenous understandings about space suggest that the archaeological exploration of areas located away from a clearly used topographic feature could be rewarding and would allow for testing whether past peoples actively incorporated the periphery into their rites. CONCLUSION Ritual has traditionally been examined through the lens of cultural studies including folklore, symbolism, and performance. But an archaeological perspec tive on contemporary Maya ceremonialism reveals that ritual practitioners also use material routes to infuse rites and sacred places with meaning. Observations at El Duende suggest that the three most potent material strategies for imbuing ritual practices with different types of social meanings are seen in decisions concerning: 1) the types of materials used as offerings in various type of rites, 2) the way in which the physical condition of the offering is altered during deposition, and 3) where the offering is deposited within the site relative to a ceremonial focal point. Through these routes, present day subsistence farmers and laborers nego tiate limited access to material resources and assign diversely different meanings</page><page sequence="25">Dangerous Places and Wild Spaces 55 to such common items as salt or chocolate. Thus, materials comprising a com moner ritual technology may consist primarily of daily quotidian items that are transformed in meaning by how and where they are deposited in an archaeological context. At El Duende, the organization of social/ritual space is framed through metaphors associated with the most fundamental spatial domain, the human body, and anchored to place by ancestral beings embodied in stone. Through ritual prac tice, the creative forces of existence encoded in the body are writ large upon the landscape with calligraphic style that takes a very material form, as individuals use objects and space to inscribe meaning upon a topographic canvas.
