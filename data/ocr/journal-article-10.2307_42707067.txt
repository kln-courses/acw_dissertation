<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vetus Testamentům A. De Wilde, Das Buch Hiob , eingeleitet , übersetzt und erläutert (Oudtestamentische Studiën, XXII). 418S. Leiden 1981. E. J. Brill. 128 Gld. This new commentary on Job is not easily categorised. The author adopts unfashionably "modern" presumptions, such as the view that the book is the work of a single author (the Elihu speeches excepted), yet echoes the past in announcing a strict strophic structure discerned at the cost of conjectural line-transposition. His concern for the meaning of the book as a whole, ably presented in his introduction, fades into the background in the commentary proper where text and philology become the principal foci of interest. Both in introduction and commentary some rather elementary ob- servations stand cheek by jowl with highly technical or penetrating remarks. The standard commentaries from Duhm to Horst are frequently enough cited but periodical literature is seldom referred to. Although these various ten- sions in the work confuse the reader's expectations, the weight and value of the book can be appreciated if one foreswears expectations and welcomes the diversity of comments, whether sober, independent or one-sided. The Introduction to the commentary is unexceptional except for its Sec- tion V on 'Der Sinn des Buches' (pp. 32-50) which offers a rich and beauti-</page><page sequence="2">Recensiones 285 fully organised survey of the forms interpretation of the book has taken from the Septuagint, through the fathers, Maimonides, and Kierkegaard, to the present day. For De Wilde, the book is a demonstration of the truth that at the deepest level humankind cannot exist on the basis of logic and reason, but only in a relationship of trust - trust in the mystérium tremendum et fascinans of the Wholly Other (R. Otto's language is explicitly cited). We can, however, I think, move closer to the book's intention by linking with such an "existentialist" interpretation an older interpretation - of Job as an exemplar of suffering humanity. De Wilde correctly protests (pp. 37 f.) that the exemplar has in the past been drawn wholly from the Job of prologue and epilogue ; but if we read the book as a unity, as De Wilde rightly does, it is equally Job the model of piety and Job the arraigner and blasphemer of God who is declared at the end to have "spoken of me what is right" (42,7). Put in more existentialist terms, the book is not primarily a demonstration of a truth (p. 36) but a poet-sage's practical advice on how to behave in adver- sity: with patience and resignation so long as that is possible, but after that with candour and feeling, giving vent to anger and bitterness, even against God - or rather, especially against God, holding him to be the author of evil and addressing him in the second person language of tormented faith rather than speaking of him in the third person language of a calmly ration- alistic theology. For the remainder of this review I shall concentrate on De Wilde's treat- ment of Job's third speech (chs. 9-10). The strophic structure first attracts our attention. De Wilde has already warned us (pp. 63 ff.) that he follows the view of Duhm and Hölscher in locating wherever possible strophes of four lines; in order to do so, he proposes 40 transpositions of lines, 8 expan- sions, and about 30 excisions ranging from one line to several verses. He allows that longer strophes sometimes close a speech or a major portion of one (e.g. 9,23 f.: 5 lines; 10,20-22: 6 lines), that 2-lines strophes with an introductory function may sometimes be found (e.g. 9,2.29), and that else- where 6-line and 3-line strophes occasionally occur. In the doxology of 9,5-10, De Wilde's division into three 4-line strophes simply contradicts the sense, since vv. 5-7 depict God's destructive acts and vv. 8-10 his creative acts. De W.'s attempt to associate v. 8 with v. 7 and detach it from v. 9 by translating the verbs of v. 8 as present and that of v. 9 as past can hardly be justified. Vv. 11-16 can more persuasively be claimed to break into three 4-line strophes, but here again two 6-line strophes, with vv. 11-13 focussing on God, vv. 14-16 on Job, seem more appropriate. Again, the unit 10,8-17 is very clearly formed of two 10-line strophes, joined at 10,13 where the mood changes and an obvious transition marker (w0' êleh) occurs; De W.'s insistence on a 4-line strophic pattern leads him to link v. 12 and v. 13, verses between which a sharp disjunction occurs, as most com- mentators agree (and as De W. himself appreciates in the structure of his comments on p. 152). In view of the absence of any formal or exegetical argument for his strophic divisions here, De W.'s conclusions on this score can be given no weight. As for the logic of Job's speech, De W., along with many other commen- tators (Gordis, Fohrer, et ai), finds the primary assertion to be that might is</page><page sequence="3">286 Recensiones right with God, who governs the world with irresponsible and arbitrary om- nipotence. Despite this sensus communis , the possibility should be enter- tained that Job's primary concern in this speech is his own vindication (as he states in the nodal verse, 9,2b) and that his charge against God is not of wilfulness at all, but of God's settled design of anger and hostility towards his world, and towards Job in particular, from the moment of creation (9,13) and the moment of Job's birth (10,13 in reference to vv. 8-12). A more close scrutiny of the logical and theological structure of the speeches may well show a shift in position on Job's part from speech to speech, against a back- ground of differentiated but immobile positions on the part of the four friends. On the text , one fresh conjectural emendation is made at 9,5: for MT /&lt;?' yâdaû De W. reads /ö' yãga' "he is not tired" - which is not bad as a conjecture, though the copyist who found it "too anthropomorphic" must have had a more heightened sensitivity than the copyist of Is 40,28 or of Mai 2,17 - where God actually is wearied). Elsewhere the most usual emenda- tions are followed, including yãmay yahadãl in 10,20 to y mê heldî , where the Qere nevertheless gives a perfectly acceptable sense, "Are not my days few? Let me alone!" - the syntax as fractured as the thought. In philology , the author shows a restraint which G. R. Driver or the lamented Fr. Dahood would have found positively reactionary. Some of the more important suggestions emanating from recent comparative Semitic phi- lology are mentioned, but not always evaluated. On 9,27, ' e' ezebâ pãnay , (?) "I will forsake my face" (RSV "I will put off my sad countenance"), Da- hood's proposal of ' zb II (Ug. 'db) is mentioned as an option, though with the meaning "erneuern"; Dahood himself translated "I shall arrange my face", i.e. "I shall wash and anoint my face" (JBL 78 [1959], 304 f.). We have in fact to seek no further than Neh 3,8; 4,2 for the meaning "repair, restore" for Heb. ' zb (whether or not cognate with Ug. ' db "repair") - which yields the satisfactory sense "I shall restore (resume) my [normal] countenance". Quite improbable, on the other hand, is Driver's opinion ( VTS 3 [1955], 76), given equal weight by De W., that Arab, 'db IV, "made agreeable", is cognate; for only a very restricted range of meanings exists for 'db IV (see Lane, p. 1981) and the verb is nowhere else attested in He- brew. Exegetically , the commentary is not rich, though I found in these two chapters one novelty (I think) which is attractive: 9,11 ("He passes by me and I see him not") is not an independent statement of the inapprehensibility of God, but simply anticipatory of the image of the irresistible "Snatcher" in v. 12. Less persuasive is the view that the crux in 9,35 lõ-kên ' ãnõkí 'immãdí means "I am not aware of any unrightousness in myself", forming an inclusio with v. 29 (a 2-line strophe in De W.'s view) ; it is preferable to read "for in myself I am not fearful" (cf. JB). It was disappointing to find no recognition of the momentousness of 10,7 for the dynamic of the book: whereas in ch. 3 Job laid no claim to guiltlessness, and in chs. 6-7 he emphasised his distress more than his innocence, in this speech he not only vigorously protests his innocence (9,15.20.21) but here - for the first time - asserts that God also knows he is innocent. To an absent-minded or mistak-</page><page sequence="4">Recensiones 287 en God Job could conceivably appeal, but from one who knows the callous- ness of what he is doing there is indeed "none to deliver". Finally, a speciality of this commentary is its fascination with realia (reminiscent of Hölscher). In these chapters five pages are devoted to the star-names of 9,9, "ein kurzer Abriss der israelitischen Sternkunde". It is uncertain what purpose is served by tabulation of the dates of visibility of these stars in Jerusalem in 500 B.C. (which the author thinks to be the approximate date of the composition of Job). A Subject Index to the Trans- lation (pp. 414-418) is an unusual feature of a commentary, though valuable in the present case, presenting at a glance references to animals, human activ- ities, parts of the body, etc. ; it portrays in impressive fashion the richness of the poet's imagery. De Wilde's work cannot be ranked among the great commentaries on Job of Driver and Gray, Dhorme and Fohrer, but deserves a respected place as a primarily textual and philological commentary of an older stamp.
