<plain_text><page sequence="1">Myriam Bienenstock, Cohen face 채 Rosenzweig: Debat sur la pensee allemande. Paris: Vrin, 2009. 250 pp. In her book Cohen face 채 Rosenzweig: Debat sur la pensee allemande, Myriam Bienenstock analyzes and confronts the works of Hermann Cohen and his disciple, Franz Rosenzweig, with a particular interest in the attempt of these two German-Jewish philosophers to appropriate the theories of German idealism. As a real debate between the two philosophers never took place, the eight chapters of Bienenstock's book are organized in a way that establishes a sort of virtual debate between them. The first chapter gives some biographical references which are necessary to understand the relationship between Cohen and Rosenzweig, their diversity and their interest in German idealistic philosophy. In the central chapters, Bienenstock reconstructs Cohen's and Rosenzweig's thought on aesthetics (chapters II and III), ethics (chapters IV and V) and the philosophy of history (chapters VI and VII). The eighth and final chapter deals with the way in which Cohen and Rosenzweig influenced Emmanuel Levinas's and Martin Buber's interpretations of German idealism. Thus, Bienenstock discusses both Cohen's and Rosenzweig's original (re-)interpretations of German idealism and the impact of their ideas on their most important successors. Throughout her book, Bienenstock argues that Cohen's and Rosenzweig's debt to German idealism has too often been neglected, while their debt to their Jewish sources has too often been interpreted in a monolithic way. She succeeds in showing that Cohen and Rosenzweig are in fact as much indebted to German idealism as they are to their Jewish sources. Bienenstock furthermore rediscovers and reconsiders their fundamental contribution to the interpretation of German idealistic thought. In fact, the works of both philosophers may not only be considered as key instruments for gaining access to German idealistic thought, but also as original re-interpretations of German thought, which had a considerable impact in philosophy, in particular in the fields of aesthetics and ethics. Last but not least, Bienenstock also discusses Cohen's and Rosenzweig's role with respect to the difficult problem of the German-Jewish dialogue. Referring to Scholem's critical stance against the German-Jewish dialogue in the nineteenth century, on the one hand, and Habermas's attempt to revive this dialogue in "The German Idealism of Jewish Philosophers" (1961), on the other, Bienenstock argues that German-Jewish dialogue has been facilitated also by the philosophies</page><page sequence="2">100 Book Reviews of Kant and Hegel, since they provided the ground on which this dialogue developed. While emphasizing their importance as interpreters of German idealism, Bienenstock also rightly stresses the fact that the differences between their philosophical, religious, and political positions prevailed over the similarities. Whereas Rosenzweig was influenced by Hegelian philosophy and wrote a still very important work, Hegel and the State, Cohen tried to build a neo Kantian system of philosophy and was critical of Hegelian philosophy. Bienenstock argues that though Rosenzweig was a disciple of Cohen, he was much more influenced by Hans Ehrenberg than by Cohen himself, and was indeed very critical of Cohen's philosophy. One of the central issues of Rosenzweig's critique of Cohen was aesthetics, in particular Cohen's discussion of the problem of the relationship between art and idolatry. Both the second and the third chapter, "La 'divinisation' de l'art: Rosenzweig et l'idealisme allemande," and " 'Le dieu monotheiste a rendu toute ironie impossible...': L'ironie de l'art, selon Hermann Cohen," respectively, focus on this problem. Though both Rosenzweig and Cohen considered poetry as very significant for religious consciousness, they nevertheless differed in their conclusions. Rosenzweig is very close to the romantic author of the "oldest systematic program of German idealism" when he associates religion to myth and poetry, whereas Cohen faulted romantic philosophy for its pernicious influence on the development of ethics. In chapter III, Bienenstock analyzes above all two of the early writings of Cohen, both published in 1867: "Die Platonische Ideenlehre psychologisch entwickelt" and "Heinrich Heine und das Judentum." In these writings, the young Cohen defends Heine's representation of Spinoza, whom he considers as a philosopher who fought against all forms of anthropomorphism in the representation of God. According to the young Cohen, who was fascinated by Heine's interpretation of Spinoza's thought, Spinoza's philosophy was a sort of "monotheistic pantheism" and was therefore in agreement with Jewish monotheism. Bienenstock analyzes the connection between Cohen's concern with the unity of consciousness and his thesis that Jewish monotheism does not tolerate art, in particular plastic art, because of its rejection of idolatry. For Cohen, what characterizes aesthetic consciousness is the relationship between das F체hlen and the language of poetry, and poetry serves as a common presupposition for all other kinds of art. Therefore, the fight of the Prophets</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 101 against idolatry succeeded also because they were themselves artists, i.e., they were excellent poets and lyricists. As Cohen wrote in his Religion of Reason out of the Sources of Judaism, what religious consciousness loses in the plastic arts is largely supplied by lyric poetry. There is no contradiction therefore between Jewish monotheism and art. Cohen's critique of Spinoza is analyzed by Myriam Bienenstock also in chapter IV, "Franz Rosenzweig et sa critique des philosophies de l'esprit." This chapter, together with chapter V, "Autonomie et autodetermination: Hermann Cohen et Kant," deals with the problem of ethics in Rosenzweig and Cohen. Rosenzweig criticizes Cohen's attempt to ground ethics on law, i.e., on the moral imperative based on law, to which he opposed the idea of a moral imperative entirely based on religious revelation. Moreover, Rosenzweig criticized the way in which Cohen conceived of the relationship between ethics and religion, and rejected the very concept of religion as it can be found in Cohen's writings. Rosenzweig's critique is based, according to Myriam Bienenstock, both on a different way of conceiving Judaism and on a different interpretation of German philosophical tradition. Chapter VI, "Le debat sur l'histoire (I): religion et politique," and chapter VII, "Le debat sur l'histoire (II): histoire et memoire," are dedicated to the discussion of the problem of the philosophy of history, to Rosenzweig's critique of Cohen's philosophy of history as well as of his attitude toward the Prussian state. In these chapters, which discuss the problem of the Law and the State, Bienenstock confronts Rosenzweig's and Cohen's position with that of one of their most famous successors, Emanuel Levinas, to whom the last chapter of the book, '"Le pharisien est absent': Levinas face 채 l'idealisme allemande," is dedicated. Throughout her book Myriam Bienenstock analyzes the different aspects of Cohen's and Rosenzweig's intepretation of Spinoza as a very significant example of their different positions regarding German idealism's interpretation of the great philosopher from Amsterdam. Cohen, in fact, criticized Spinoza's position in all his later works, because he rejected, as did Heine, the romantic idea of "mediation." According to Bienenstock, Spinoza would have been considered by the romantic thinkers, in particular by Schleiermacher, as a Christ figure or as an artist who has the function of a mediator. When Cohen in 1915 attacked Spinoza's pantheism, he did not have in mind Heine's interpretation of Spinoza, but rather Hegel's interpretation, or better, Wilhelm Dilthey's reading of Hegel's interpretation. According to</page><page sequence="4">102 Book Reviews Cohen's critique, Hegel, Schleiermacher, and the other romantic thinkers have in common the idea of a "theology of mediation," and Rosenzweig, who insists on the importance of Cohen's critique of pantheism, nevertheless has an affinity with that kind of theology. In fact, he affirmed, maybe following Eugen Rosenstock, that the spirit (Geist), as a human spirit, is nothing but a "spirit of the transmission and of the translation." On this reading, the main difference between Rosenzweig and Cohen is to be found in the idea of the "mediation." To conclude, Bienenstock's book is a profound and well-argued contribution that should be considered as essential reading by all those scholars of philosophy who are concerned with the problems of twentieth century Jewish philosophy and with the relationship between philosophy and Judaism in the modern tradition.
