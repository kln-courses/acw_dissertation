DE WAAL and DEBORAH YOSHIHARA1) (Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center, Madison, WI, U.S.A.) (With 3 Figures) (Acc. 15. 1.1983) Introduction The occurrence of reconciliations among chimpanzees, reported by DE WAAL &amp; VAN ROOSMALEN (1979), has recently been regarded as one out of several indications that these great apes have entered a cognitive domain which sets them apart from almost all other animals. The suggestion is that reconciliations depend on introspection and self-awareness (GALLUP, 1982). While not denying that chimpanzees may possess these mental abilities and may use them in a great variety of social contexts, we wonder whether these abilities are necessary to explain the phenomenon of reconciliation. The minimum requirements seem rather simple: a) in- dividual recognition, b) a good memory ("who was my opponent?"), and c) conciliatory tendendies. The first two capacities are definitely present in many animal species, not only primates. The third requisite may have more to do with a species' social temperament than with its cognitive powers. It may be ab- sent in solitary animals, but one would expect that animals living in groups or pairs would benefit from mechanisms to restore peace in an ac- tive way, rather than depend on time to heal their "wounds". The study of post-conflict behavior may assist our understanding of social cohesion, conflict resolution and tension reduction. DE WAAL (in press) discusses the theoretical ramifications of the subject, and tries to integrate them in a 'reconciled hierarchy model'. This model is partly 1) This study was supported by NIH grant RR-00167.

The central point is that social attraction forms an integrated part of dominance-subordinance relationships, i.e., that such relationships reflect a compromise between agonistic and socially positive tendencies. The model is presumed to be applicable to a wide range of animals. The present study investigates whether the rhesus monkey, Macaca mulatta, is also a possible candidate. The species is of interest as it has the reputation of being aggressive and intolerant. But maybe even this primate shows some "hedonic" tendencies. We shall address the question: "Do rhesus monkeys reconcile?" That is, do former opponents seek friendly contact with each other after their conflict? The mere regular occurrence of post-conflict contacts between opponents is not sufficient, because in a species with a bad memory or lack of individual recognition one would also expect such contacts to hap- pen. We must know how the probability that monkey A contacts B is af- fected by a preceding A-B conflict, and also whether their first post- conflict contact is behaviorally different from contacts in other contexts. In other words, do we have any reason to believe that there is a connec- tion between conflicts and subsequent inter-opponent contacts? Although there are some indications for the existence of this connection in other species, both primates (e.g., MCKENNA, 1978; SEYFARTH, 1976) and non-primates (e.g., RASA, 1977; PFEFFER, 1967), the only systematic investigation of the specific problems outlined above was that by DE WAAL &amp; VAN ROOSMALEN (1979). They found evidence that after an agonistic interaction chimpanzees preferentially made contact with former opponents rather than with third parties, and that the most characteristic behavior between former opponents was a mouth-mouth kiss. These contacts were labelled 'reconciliations'. The term refers to an objectively definable interaction type, but it admittedly has a strong human psychological connotation. Similar anthropomorphism is present in more familiar terms such as threat, submission and appeasement. We concur with ASQUITH (in press) when she concludes that ethologists have always used the human referent as an important heuristic aid to theory- formation. The observation methods used in this rhesus study are essentially the same as those of DE WAAL &amp; VAN ROOSMALEN (1979), but we have added a series of control observations. This allows for a more conclusive inter- pretation of the data, and also for an analysis of some general effects of aggression on subsequent social interactions in the group.</page><page sequence="3">226 FRANS B. M. DE WAAL &amp; DEBORAH YOSHIHARA Methods The group. The rhesus monkeys used in this study are usually referred to here as the "natural" troop, because all its original members came from a single troop in Utar Pradesh, India. In the weeks before a large part of this feral troop was caught the trapper counted fifty-four monkeys in it. With the Indian government's approval, thirty-eight monkeys were ship- ped to the Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center. They were released at the Center's Breeding Facility in the Vilas Park Zoo on 16 June 1972. Most present troop members were born since then, except for the alpha-male and nine of the matriarchs of eleven kinship groups. Cropping has been done to prevent over-crowding. During the period of study, Sept. 1981-June 1982, the troop comprised: 3 adult males (reaching at least 5 years of age), 22 adult females (reaching at least 4 years), 1 subadult male (reaching 4 years), and 15 juveniles and adolescents; making a total of 41 in- dividuals. In addition, seventeen females gave birth during the last months of the study period. Living conditions. The group was housed in an indoor-outdoor pen. The outdoor section was 6 m high, with a concrete floor of approximately 75 m2 and a large steeply sloping wall of stratified limestone blocks; the mesh floor of the inside section measured 25 m2. For a cross-section of the pen see WEISBARD &amp; GOY (1976). In the winter the inner section was heated and the wire mesh of the outdoor section was covered with plexiglas, which protected against the wind and provided a greenhouse effect on sunny days. The monkeys usually had free access to both sections. Each morning, before 10:30 AM, the cage was cleaned and the monkeys were fed. At least half an hour before the start of our observations, at 1:00 PM, we would chase the monkeys into the outdoor section and lock them out. At this time of the day plenty of food pellets usually still remained spread over the floor. The observations ended before 5:00 PM. On extremely cold and sunless winter days we took no data. Observation procedure. Agonistic interactions were defined by the occurrence of facial threats (e.g., 'staring open- mouth face', cf. VAN HOOFF, 1967) and certain vocalizations, such as grunts, barks and screams. In addition, the interaction should include locomotion on the aggressor's part, i.e., a lunge or pursuit covering more than two meters. When an agonistic interaction was noticed one of the participants was designated as the 'focal animal'. Its opponents were noted down, together with the intensity and direction of the aggression. We distinguished between 'light' and 'heavy' aggression, the latter con- sisting of fierce biting with headshaking movements. We also distinguished between the focal's 'main' opponent and 'other' opponents, the former being its only opponent or the one with whom the most intensive and longlasting exchange of agonistic behavior took place. Individuals which had formed an alliance with the focal animal, either by giving agonistic support or by being supported, were designated as the focal's 'partners'. While selecting focal animals the observer considered the frequency with which the par- ticipants had occurred in preceding protocols and selected the individual with the lowest frequency. If several agonistic interactions occurred simultaneously, or in rapid succes- sion, priority was given to relatively rare incidents, i. e., those involving heavy aggression, conflicts among males, and conflicts among relatives. Focals were selected in such a way that about half of them were aggressors and the other half recipients of aggression. Post-conflict observations (PC's) started immediately after the focal animal had stopped ex- changing agonistic behavior. If the agonistic interaction was resumed within two minutes it was considered as not having ended, and the onset of the observation was postponed.</page><page sequence="4">RECONCILIATION IN RHESUS MONKEYS 227 The focal animal was followed for 10 minutes after light aggression, except for every fifth incident, after which it was followed for 20 min. After heavy aggression observations always lasted 20 min. The focal's behavior was scored by a single observer (either DY or FdW) on a checksheet divided into one minute blocks. Behavioral categories which were sampled once per minute are followed below by 'Min', categories scored whenever they occurred by 'Always'. - Selfgrooming (Min): focal animal groomed or licked its own body or its own infant. - Solitary (Min): focal had been sitting out of arm's reach of other monkeys for at least 45 sec during a given minute. - Contact (Always): any non-agonistic body contact with focal, even if it had only been in passing. The identity of the other individual and the initiative to the contact were recorded. - Contact-sit (Min): continuous sitting and huddling contacts were noted each minute through which they lasted longer than 15 sec. - Social grooming (Always/Min): the occurrence of grooming during a social contact was always mentioned, and if the grooming continued it was again mentioned in subsequent minutes, together with its direction. - Aggression (Always): aggressive actions, defined by facial threats and vocalizations, performed or received by the focal animal. Locomotion was not required. The above mentioned behavioral categories were recorded regardless of whether the in- dividuals involved were the focal's former opponents, its alliance partners, or other group members. Infants born in 1981 and 1982 were ignored in the observations. In addi- tion, we recorded for interactions with opponents and partners: - Being within 2 meters (Min): the focal and its main opponent had been within 2 m distance from each other. - Coming close (Always): the focal and an opponent or partner approached to within easy arm's reach from each other. - Details of contact (Always): the checksheet had special room for full descriptions of contacts between the focal and its opponent(s) or partner(s). Matched-control observations (MC's) corresponded with a particular PC observation, they were made on the next possible observation day, started at exactly the same time of day as the PC, followed the same focal animal for the same length of time by the same observer, and paid special attention to the same individuals as those which had been the focal's op- ponents and partners in the PC. If the focal animal was involved in an agonistic interac- tion in the minutes preceding a planned MC, or in the first two minutes of an ongoing MC, the observation was postponed until the next possible day. The MC procedure ensured that the control data had the same distribution over the group members, the time of day, and the seasons (both in terms of the weather and of the group's reproductive activity) as the data on post-conflict behavior. This allowed for both pair-wise and overall comparisons between the two sets of data. Results I. Inter-opponent contacts and distances. The null-hypothesis is that agonistic interactions do not affect subsequent chances of contact between individuals, i.e., that the length of contact- intervals is the same for Post-Conflict (PC) and Matched-Control (MC) observations. 'Contact-interval' is defined as the first minute-block since the onset of observation in which two individuals made a contact. There</page><page sequence="5">228 FRANS B. M. DE WAAL &amp; DEBORAH YOSHIHARA are two alternative hypotheses: that of dispersal and that of reconciliation. The first hypothesis predicts that former opponents generally avoid one another, making PC contact-intervals longer than those during MC's. The reconciliation hypothesis, in contrast, predicts shorter intervals during PC's. The comparison is based on 350 PC and an equal number of MC observations. The focal animals had altogether 573 opponents. Since we failed to find any significant differences in inter-opponent behavior related to the aggression intensity of the encounter prior to the PC, we shall present the data on this subject without distinguishing between the two intensity classes. We have also lumped ten minute and twenty minute observations, because the above predictions are the same ir- respective of observation length, as long as PC's and MC's are matched in length, which is the case. The same applies to the analyses in sections II and III. (N.B. When tested separately ten and twenty minute observa- tions yield the same results). If two former opponents made contact during the PC only, or at least earlier in the PC than in the MC, the pair was said to show 'attraction'. If the reverse happened, i.e., a shorter contact-interval in the MC, the pair was said to show 'dispersal'. We recorded 131 'attracted' and 56 'dispersed' pairs, which is significantly different from the expected 1:1 ratio (X2 = 30.1, p&lt; .001, two-tailed). Fig. 1 gives contact-intervals for a cumulative percentage of pairs of individuals, either as former opponents (PC) or as control opponents (MC). Data for the first ten minutes is bas- ed on all 573 opponent pairs, the second part is based on those 139 pairs which were followed for twenty minutes. The percentage of pairs with contact was significantly higher during PC observations, both after ten and twenty minutes. But it is clear from the graph that the difference was entirely created during the first ten minutes. Being able to reject both the null-hypothesis and the dispersal hypothesis as far as inter-opponent contact is concerned, it is logical to assume that this is also possible for proximity, because contact implies proximity. However, if the pairs which made contact in PC and/or MC are excluded from analysis, then the proximity scores of the remaining pairs provide an independent measure for attraction vs. dispersal. When considering close-intervals (i.e., the first minute-block in which two in- dividuals came close) for non-contacting pairs of opponents we found 85 'attracted' and 36 'dispersed' pairs. Also this result differs significantly from the expected 1:1 ratio (X2 = 19.8, p&lt;.001, two-tailed).</page><page sequence="6">RECONCILIATION IN RHESUS MONKEYS 229 In the above two chi-square tests each pair of opponents was considered an independent source of information. This is not entirely correct, because most of the 41 group members figured several times as a focal animal. The possibility exists that only a handful of monkeys was responsible for the major trends in the data. For each individual the opponent-pairs involving him as a focal animal were divided into 'attracted' and 'dispers- ed' pairs on the basis of both contact and proximity. If the number of 'attracted' pairs in- volving the individual exceeded the number of 'dispersed' pairs he was called a positive individual. In case of the opposite trend he was called a negative individual, and if there was no difference he was not considered. For contacts between opponents we found 28 positive and 9 negative individuals, and for proximity 23 positive and 4 negative in- dividuals. These ratios indicate that the trends in our data were representative for the large majority of individual monkeys. 30- % PC 25 20- 2o 0 /, MC , .-' 15- / 0- 5 1 2 Min. 0 5 10 15 20 Min. ----- Contact - interval Fig. 1. Cumulative percentage of opponent pairs making contact within a certain time in- terval. PC = post-conflict observations, MC = matched-control observations. Another indication, not independent from the previous ones, comes from data on the number of minute-blocks in which main opponents had been seen within a distance of 2 m from each other. Of the 350 pairs of main opponents 54% spent more of their first ten minutes within that distance during the PC, 24% more during the MC, and the remaining pairs spent no time or equal time within that distance. The conclusion is that the probability that two rhesus monkeys will make friendly contact, or at least approach one another in a non- agonistic manner, is increased after an aggressive confrontation between them.</page><page sequence="7">230 FRANS B. M. DE WAAL &amp; DEBORAH YOSHIHARA II. Selective attraction. There are two possible explanations for inter-opponent 'attraction'. The one is that there is a general contact increase after agonistic incidents, which increase indiscriminately includes contacts among the participants themselves. In section V we shall see that there is indeed evidence for a general increase. If this would be the explanation the term 'attraction' would be definitely misused. The term is only justified in case the other possibility can be proven, namely that there is not only an absolute but also a relative increase in inter-opponent contacts. We counted each focal's contact-partners, i.e., the number of different individuals contacted in the course of an observation period irrespective of the initiative to contact and the number of contacts per partner. Then the number of former opponents contacted was expressed as a percentage of the total number of contact-partners during PC's. The percentage was 9.6% (N = 1,457). In contrast, the percentage of control opponents con- tacted during MC's was 4.7% (N = 1,301). The difference between the two proportions is significant (X2= 23.9, p&lt;.001, two-tailed), which means that there must have been selective attraction between former op- ponents. The same analysis can be applied to contacts with alliance partners. These individuals constituted 3.2% of the contact-partners during PC's, and 1.7% during MC's, indicating selective attraction between former supporters as well (X2 = 5.5, p&lt; .05, two-tailed). III. Differences in behavior. There were some qualitative indications that focals had remembered who their adversary had been. For example, they might, after having rested for a few minutes, start looking around, scanning the huddle groups, on- ly to stop when the opponent was spotted. Their sudden concentration and subsequent approach made it clear that they had been searching for the other. It should be noted, though, that such behavior was inconspicuous and infrequent. Usually inter-opponent contacts rather gave the impression of being unintentional. This is in remarkable contrast to chimpanzee reconciliations, which almost always give the impression of being deliberately sought. These different impression on the human observer may stem from the fact that the "rules" for eye-contact among macaques are different from those among chimpanzees and human beings. Chimpanzees avoid eye- contact in tense situations and seek it in friendly contexts, whereas rhesus</page><page sequence="8">RECONCILIATION IN RHESUS MONKEYS 231 monkeys almost only stare at each other while signalling aggression. The typical prolonged mutual gaze of chimpanzees as an introduction to their reconciliation is in line with the observer's intuitive expectations of an in- tentional approach. This in contrast to the macaque's habit of nervously looking in all directions except in the face of the former opponent. The data on contact frequencies, however, presented in the previous sections, demonstrate that post-conflict contacts among rhesus monkeys are less accidental than they may seem. Another piece of evidence comes from the full descriptions of interactions between opponents. For the pur- pose of analysis we have distinguished the following behavioral categories: Grooming: making at least some grooming hand movements through the other's fur. Groom-present: presentation of a particular body part (e.g., chest, flank) with the exception of the genital region. Genital-present: presentation of the genital region, often with tail-up. Inspect: smelling and closely watching part of the other's body (e.g., mouth, genitals). Embrace: putting one or both arms around the other. Also a few in- stances of a gentle hand touch have been included into this category. Lipsmack: rapid lip movements without opening of the mouth. Bared-teeth: lip-retraction displaying the teeth. Leave: within 15 sec. after the contact was made the approached in- dividual walked away. Sometimes this took the form of avoidance. (N. B. Avoidance preventing the occurrence of contact was not included, because we only consider behavior during or preceding contacts here). Assert: category of "liberties" taken towards the other, e.g., rough pushing with hand(s), pulling of tail, pulling out hair, or climbing over the other. Redirect: threatening a third monkey during a contact initiative, usually with rapid 'showlooking' movements (cf. DE WAAL et al., 1976) towards the contact partner. Table 1 presents the frequencies with which these behavioral categories were mentioned in three contexts: first inter-opponent contacts (N = 144), subsequent inter-opponent contacts during PC's (N = 103), and MC contacts between focals and their control opponents (N = 109). For each behavior we computed expected frequencies, assuming that the distribution over the contact types would correspond with the relative fre- quencies of these contacts.</page><page sequence="9">232 FRANS B.

The chi-square test compares for each behavior pattern separately the observed frequen- cies with those expected from the frequencies of the three contact types. The first comparisons between observed and expected frequencies were restricted to combinations of two contact types. The summed chi-square values were 29.7 for the First-PC/MC comparison, 15.2 for the First-PC/Subsequent-PC comparison, and 9.2 for the Subsequent- PC/MC comparison. These overall values indicate that first inter- opponent contacts were special, differing more from each of the other two contact types than that these two differed from each other. Table 1 gives the chi-square values for each behavioral category separately, this time based on a comparison over all three contact types. According to this analysis, three behavior patterns were typical for first post-conflict contacts: redirection of aggression, embrace and lipsmack. Further inspection of the descriptions shows that redirection was usually done by the party who had received aggression in the preceding incident, embracing usually by the aggressor, and lipsmacking usually by both op- ponents simultaneously. Grooming behavior occurred about equally often in the three contexts, its relative frequency ranging between 19 and 23% of the contacts. So, although grooming is the most common specific contact pattern between former opponents it cannot be called a characteristic reconciliatory pat- tern. This finding is similar to that by DE WAAL &amp; VAN ROOSMALEN (1979) concerning grooming among chimpanzees. A study by McKENNA (1978), on the other hand, reports a sigificant grooming increase following ag-</page><page sequence="10">RECONCILIATION IN RHESUS MONKEYS 233 gression among hanuman langurs (Presbytis entellus). This result is not necessarily contradictory to ours, however. Our analysis concerned the probability that inter-opponent contacts included grooming, which measure is very different from the absolute and general grooming rate us- ed by MCKENNA (1978). As we shall see in Section V, this rate is affected by previous agonistic interactions in the rhesus monkey also. A behavior not included in the analysis because of its low frequency, i.e., mounting, has been observed to end agonistic sequences in rhesus monkeys (MAXIM, 1976) and gelada baboons (Theropithecus gelada; KUMMER, 1975). We observed four mounts between former opponents, and none between control opponents. Whereas here is a slight suggestion of a link between mounting and previous aggression, the reassuring func- tion of this behavior seems not very pronounced in a well-established group. The two studies mentioned above concerned the much tenser con- text of confrontations between strangers. IV. Proximate mechanisms of kinship. An obvious question is whether reconciliations occurred more or less easily among kin than among non-kin. Kinship between individuals is defined here by the presence of a common female ancestor in the group, or in its known history. There were 67 kin relationships. As a measure of conciliatory tendency we used the percentage of 'at- tracted' pairs of former opponents. Since observation length (ten or twenty minutes) may influence this measure, the analysis will be restricted to (the first) ten minutes of observation. An 'attracted' pair has been defined as a pair with a shorter contact-interval during the PC as compared to the MC period. This means that the measure of conciliatory tendency has a built-in correction for the pair's general contact tendency. That is, opponents with a high control level of contacts have to show an even higher than normal contact tendency during PC periods in order to become an 'attracted' pair. Due to special attention to conflicts among kin (see Methods section) a fair number of opponent pairs was related. Their conciliatory tendency was 30.2% (N= 63) as compared to 18.6 (= 510) among non-kin. The difference is significant (X2 = 4.0, p&lt; .05, two-tailed). Two hypotheses can explain this result. According to the first hypothesis rhesus monkeys know their matrilineal relatives and reconcile more often with them because they are kin. According to the second hypothesis kinship per se plays no role. Reconciliation depends in the first place on social bonds, and the high conciliatory tendency among kin</page><page sequence="11">234 FRANS B. M. DE WAAL &amp; DEBORAH YOSHIHARA TABLE 2.

This fact is well-documented for macaques (e.g., KURLAND, 1977; WEIGEL, 1980), and also applied to our group (un- published data). From the last hypothesis we can derive the prediction that non-kin with strong social bonds will be more conciliatory than kin with weak bonds. To determine the strength of social bonds all control observations were taken together. The measure used here is the contact time between two in- dividuals, i.e., the proportion of minute-blocks of their total MC follow- ing time spent contact-sitting or grooming. Based on contact time Table 2 distinguishes five relationship classes. The table gives, separately for kin and non-kin, for each class the number of opponent pairs followed (N) and the number of 'attracted' pairs found. It is evident from Table 2 that the difference in conciliatory tendency between kin and non-kin disappears when considered per contact time class. When corrected for contact time, by computing a weighed average over the classes, the conciliatory tendencies of kin and non-kin are nearly identical. As regards the prediction made above, it depends where one draws the line between strong and weak bonds. A comparison between kin of the lower three classes and non-kin of the upper two classes gives a significant result (X2 = 3.9, p&lt; .05, one-tailed) in the predicted direction. These results provide no argument to regard kinship as a separate proximate factor. Its effect on the occurrence of reconciliation can be ful- ly explained by the same mechanisms as those which seem to operate among non-kin. The conciliatory tendency steadily increased with the familiarity and intimacy between individuals, as measured by contact</page><page sequence="12">RECONCILIATION IN RHESUS MONKEYS 235 time (Fig. 2). The link between the two is especially meaningful in view of the built-in correction for normal contact frequency mentioned in the beginning of this section. V. General effects. The previous analyses concerned behavior within the opponent pairs. This represents only a small portion of the whole scale of potential behavioral changes caused by aggression in a group. In order to in- vestigate some general effects the 350 focal animals were divided into four classes: Heavy Aggressors (N = 47), Light Aggressors (N = 132), Heavy Recipients (N= 44), and Light Recipients (N= 127).

The comparison concerned four dura- tion measures and four frequency measures: The number of minute- blocks spent solitary, selfgrooming, socially grooming or being groomed, and the frequencies of contacts made/received and aggressive actions per- formed/received. We considered two aspects of the changes in these behaviors. In the first place a change index; ranging between + 1 (behavior only observed during PC) and -1 (only during MC), which is defined as the difference in duration or frequency divided by the sum. Secondly, a chi-square test</page><page sequence="13">236 FRANS B. M. DE WAAL &amp; DEBORAH YOSHIHARA to compare between the number of focals with a higher PC score and the number with a higher MC score, expecting a 1:1 ratio. Fig. 3 presents the results. After their attack Heavy Aggressors were more active both as contact makers, as groomers and as selfgroomers. The non-significant drop in their receipt of grooming is noteworthy in comparison to Light Ag- gressors. These showed an opposite pattern of changes, grooming slightly less themselves, but receiving more grooming. In addition, they not only made but also received more contacts. Obviously Heavy Recipients showed the most dramatic effects. They were very solitary focal animals. They spent more time grooming themselves, touching the body parts where they had been bitten, or lick- ing blood. There was almost no change in their contact activity, but con- tacts did not last for long and grooming time decreased. Light Reci- pients, on the other hand, showed few changes. They made more con- tacts and received more aggression. Recently, BOCCIA et al. (1982) concluded that it is questionable whether grooming in rhesus monkeys occurs in direct response to the disruptive influence of aggression. According to these authors, aggression may ac- tually disrupt or preclude the occurrence of grooming. The present study indicates that the relationship between the two behaviors is far from sim- ple. The proportion of inter-opponent contacts with grooming did not in- crease after aggression (section III), and changes in the general grooming rate included both increases and decreases dependent on the intensity of the preceding aggression, the way the focal individual had been involved in it, and the direction of grooming considered. Whereas BOCCIA et al. (1982) report a complete grooming cessation after fights, in our study Heavy Aggressors showed a grooming increase. In the next section this increase will be interpreted as redirected affection. Since this mechanism may require the presence of more or less neutral outsiders it may not operate within groups of only a few monkeys in a small cage, as used by BoccIA et al. (1982). VI. Redirected affection. One of the most puzzling results in Fig. 3 is the increased grooming ac- tivity by Heavy Aggressors. Further inspection of the data showed that this grooming was almost entirely directed to outsiders, i. e., 93 % went to individuals who had not participated in the preceding agonistic interac- tion. It was not uncommon for an aggressor to start the grooming im- mediately after the outburst of violence.

DE WAAL &amp; DEBORAH YOSHIHARA movements would be rough and rapid, still reflecting some of the in- dividual's excitement. Traditionally, ethologists have emphasized an "internal conflict" be- tween aggression and fear. It may be more profitable, however, to con- sider a triangular "conflict" between aggression, fear and attraction (DE WAAL, in press). For example, KUMMER et al. (1974, p. 79) describe how male hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas) redirect grooming to stones and small objects when they are attracted to a male-female pair but at the same time socially inhibited to interact. RIJKSEN (1981) published a photograph of a female of the same species frantically grooming sand in front of her harem leader in an apparent "conflict" between fear and at- traction. TABLE 3. Frequency and average duration of grooming by Heavy Ag- gressors towards third individuals dependent on the relationship between aggressor and victim in terms of contact time Contact time class of Heavy Aggressor grooms Average opponent pairs third individual(s) grooming minutes Yes No A, B, C 10 4 3.2 D 5 5 1.9 E 5 18 1.0 The classes are the same as those used in Table 2. Similarly, the grooming increase by Heavy Aggressors might result from an emotional "conflict" between a still hostile attitude towards the victim, on the one hand, and attraction to the same individual, on the other. If grooming of outsiders actually results from these opposite tendencies, it might be called redirected affection. The lack of such behavior in Light Aggressors might be because their hostility had remained within the limits of what a relationship can bear. In other words, redirected af- fection occurs when a good relationship has been put into jeopardy. These interpretations may sound far-fetched, but we can derive at least one prediction from them, i.e., that grooming towards outsiders will be positively correlated with the intensity of the bond between the Heavy Aggressor and its victim. In order to test this prediction bond strength was again measured by contact time during all MC periods, using the same classes as in Section IV. Since only 47 focal observations concerned Heavy Aggressors the sample size per class was small and the upper three</page><page sequence="16">RECONCILIATION IN RHESUS MONKEYS 239 classes have been taken together in Table 3. The table shows the presence/absence of grooming towards third individuals during the first ten minutes of the PC observation, and the average number of grooming minutes. A chi-square test on the frequencies in Table 3 gives a significant result in the predicted direction (X2 = 9.0, df= 2, p&lt; .01, one-tailed). The con- clusion is that after a really severe attack by A against B, A's tendency to groom outsider C depended on the kind of relationship that A normally had with its victim. Close ties between A and B increased the chance of A grooming C. Discussion After the chasing, fighting and noise of a major agonistic interaction are over, the quiet events that follow may give the impression of being relatively unimportant, as if the monkeys are merely settling down. The present study provides evidence for a different view. Adversaries seem to keep an eye on each other for many minutes. They tend to approach and contact one another. Since the attraction is selectively aimed at the adver- sary and since the resulting contacts involve special behavior patterns, a term like reconciliation is justified. The most typical conciliatory patterns of the rhesus monkey are embracing, lipsmacking and redirected threats. The general strength of the bond between former opponents is a good indicator of the probability that they will reconcile. The correlation sug- gests that post-conflict contacts serve the maintenance of social bonds, both among kin and among non-kin. Remarkably, behavior towards out- siders also may, to some extent, depend on the nature of the relationship between aggressor and victim, e.g., redirected affection. The only satisfactory theoretical framework for results like these seems a dominance-subordinance model which includes attraction between in- dividuals as a central factor, i.e., what has been called "the affective com- ponent of the hierarchy" (DE WAAL, in press). It may be somewhat counter intuitive that the occurrence of aggression should have a cohesive effect on a group of monkeys, but our data demonstrate that, instead of dispersion, major agonistic encounters cause a wave of contacts and socially positive behavior in the group. Apparent- ly conflicts are not forgotten, they are resolved. Summary The question whether rhesus monkeys reconcile was empirically translated as: Do they seek non-agonistic contact with former adversaries? The study concerned a captive group</page><page sequence="17">240 FRANS B. M. DE WAAL &amp; DEBORAH YOSHIHARA of forty-one monkeys, Macaca mulatta. Participants in 350 aggressive incidents were follow- ed both immediately after the incident and during matched control periods. Comparison of the two sets of data showed that: - After the incident former opponents had an increased tendency to approach and contact each other. - The attraction between them was selective, i.e., the number of inter-opponent con- tacts showed not only an absolute but also a relative increase. -Also former alliance partners showed attraction to each other. -Inter-opponent contacts were behaviorally distinctive. The most characteristic behavior patterns were embrace, lipsmack and redirected threat. - Conciliatory tendency increased with general bond strength between individuals, even though the first measure had a built-in correction for the second. - A higher conciliatory tendency among matrilineal relatives could be fully explained by the above mentioned influence of bond strength. -General effects of agonistic interactions included a grooming increase for violent aggressors, a grooming decrease for victim of severe aggression, and an increased receipt of grooming for mild aggressors. - Grooming of outsiders by violent aggressors depended on the intensity of the bond between aggressor and victim. Therefore, this grooming behavior was interpreted as redirected affection. References ALTMANN, S. (1962). A field study of the sociobiology of rhesus monkeys, Macaca mulatta. - Ann. N.Y. Acad.

Cette question a ete formulee empiriquement ainsi: Est-ce qu'ils cherchent a avoir des contacts non agressifs avec leurs adversaires apres un conflit? Cette etude a ete faite sur un groupe de 41 singes en captivity, Macaca mulatta. Les singes ayant pris part a des incidents agressifs (N = 350) ont ete suivis immediatement apres ces incidents et aussi pendant des periodes de control. La comparaison de ces deux series de donnees a montre que: - Apres l'incident, les ex-adversaires cherchaient davantage a s'approcher et a avoir des contacts entre eux. - Cette attirance etait selective: le nombre de contacts entre les ex-adversaires s'etait accru non seulement de facon absolue mais aussi de facon relative. - Les ex-partenaires d'une alliance etaient egalement attires reciproquement. - Les contacts entre les ex-adversaires se distinguaient par le comportement montre. Les comportements les plus caracteristiques etaient: embrassement, 'lipsmack', menace redirigee. - La tendance a se reconcilier dependait de la force du lien unissant les individus, malgre un facteur de correction inclus dans la premiere mesure. - Une tendance plus haute a la reconciliation parmi les membres de la lignee maternelle pouvait etre entierement expliquee par l'influence du lien mentionne plus haut. - Les effets generaux des incidents agressifs incluaient des changements dans le com- portement relatif au soin pris pour la fourrure d'autrui. Il s'agit d'un accroissement de ce comportement par les agresseurs violents, un decroissement par les victimes d'agressions graves, tandis que les agresseurs non-violents, eux, etaient davantage l'objet de ce comportement. - Le soin pris pour la fourrure des outsiders par les agresseurs violents dependait de l'intensite du lien unissant l'agresseur a sa victime. Aussi ce comportement a-t-il ete interpreted comme affection redirigee.</page></plain_text>
