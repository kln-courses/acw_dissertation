<plain_text><page sequence="1">WAS THE FLAMINICA DIALIS PRIESTESS OF JUNO? THE statement has often been made that, as the Flamen Dialis was the priest of Jupiter, so his wife was the priestess of Juno. I do not know who was originally responsible for so natural an inference. I do not find it in Ambrosch, the surest-footed of the earlier writers on the Roman religious system. But the assertion was made by Preller, though not quite so definitely as by later writers; the Flaminica was 'eine priesterliche Dienerin der Juno.' (Jordan in his edition has added no comment, vol. i. p. 122.) Marquardt (Staatsverfassung, ed. 2, p. 331) says plainly that she was 'Priesterin der Juno,' and here again Wissowa the excellent editor makes no remark. Roscher in his tract on Juno and Hera goes a trifle further: 'die Flaminica Dialis hatte den Opferdienst der Juno zu versehen.' Hence the statement has found its way into the same scholar's article on Juno in his Mythological Lexicon, and is repeated still more emphatically in the article on Jupiter in the same work (p. 700). I do not suppose that I should have been led to test the value of these assertions, if they had not been recently used to support a much more important inference, and one of the utmost interest for the student of early Italian religious ideas. Preller allowed himself to write in passing that 'the Flamen and his wife appeared before the people as in some sense the living images of the deities of light whom they serve.' Roscher took the hint and, after his manner, carried it out to its logical consequences. He sees in the Flamen and his wife, and the rules of life which governed them, a means of getting at the ideas which lay at the root of the cult of Jupiter and Juno. The latter, in his view, are husband and wife, as well as gods presiding over marriage (Myth. Lex. s.v. Juno, p. 590; cp. Juno and Hera, p. 63). Or, as the author of the article on Jupiter puts it, 'die alterthiimliche institution des flamen und der flaminica beweist auch, dass die paarweise Gitterverehrung in Italien eine urspriingliche war.' This inference is to the explorer at first sight as water in a thirsty land. He knows that the cult is the only safe guide in the study of old Italian religion: he knows that the question-a vital one-whether the oldest Romans thought of any of their gods as married couples, cannot be decided by any literary evidence. But if it can be proved that the priest of Jupiter was the husband of the priestess of Juno, he feels at once that he has hold of something definite and trustworthy. The peculiar sanctity of the marriage tie in this case, together with the strange restrictions under which the pair were placed, and the undoubted antiquity of the priesthoods, taken in comparison with evidence from other races as to the relation of gods and priests, prepare him to accept the inference as one of great value. If the water should not turn out to be a mirage, we may fairly believe that Jupiter and Juno were really a married couple, and that the oldest</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. 475 Italians had got at least as far as this on their way towards polytheism. We know that the Flamen Dialis was attached to the cult of Jupiter: but what is the evidence that the Flaminica was priestess of Juno? All the writers I have quoted, and some others of less importance, cite but a single passage, and that from an author whose authority on such matters is not weighty and who in this particular in- stance expresses himself doubtfully. Plutarch in his 86th Roman Question speaks of the Flaminica as cpav r-I "Hpas drvac oKovo'cav. (Roscher would read Ipcmav on no manuscript- al evidenced) In this 86th Question Plutarch may have been drawing, directly or indirectly, on a gloss of Verrius Flaccus (cp. Festus s.v. Maius mensis): but there is nothing in Festus to bear out his remark about the Flaminica, and the word BOKOvo-av shows pretty clearly that what he says of her is simply his own suggestion, which of itself is quite worthless. Apart from this passage I can find no ancient authority for the idea that the Flaminica was specially concerned with the cult of Juno. There may be such authority, but if the eminent scholars I have quoted can find nothing better than Plutarch's doubtful sentence, I am not likely to be able to do so. And indeed I find a good deal which points in a different direction. In a Verrian gloss on flammeum I find the following : Paulus, p. 92, line 16: ' flammeo vestimento flaminica utebatur, id est Dialis uxor et Jovis sacerdos, cui telum fulminis eodem erat colore.' This definite statement, coming from a good authority, that the Flaminica was priestess of Jupiter, is borne out by a passage of Macrobius. On the nundinae, he says, quoting Granius Licini- anus, she offered a ram to Jupiter in the Regia (Sat. i. 16. 30): on the other hand, on the Kalends of every month from March to December, which were specially sacred to Juno, it is not the Flaminica who sacrifices to Juno, but the regina sacrorumr: cf. Ambrosch, Studien and Andeutungen, p. 13. And, so far as I know, none of the rites in which the Flaminica was concerned have any direct reference to Juno: see Marquardt, op. cit. p. 332. Again, at Falerii, which was especially devoted to the cult of Juno, we hear of no peculiar priestess, but of a pontifex sacrarius of certain female sacerdotes (Ov. Amor. iii. 13; Dion. Hal. i. 21). Negatively such evidence as this must be allowed some weight when there is nothing posi- tive to be set against it; and all I am contending for is that we have no right, in the present condition of the evidence, to assume that the Flaminica was Juno's priestess, much less to build upon this assumption important conclusions about the early Italian conception of the relation of Jupiter to Juno. I doubt whether but for such assumptions Dr. Roscher would have seen in the Juno-festival at Falerii (described by Ovid in the passage just quoted) a true Italian equivalent to the lpes yc4dos of Zeus and Hera (Myth. Lex. s.v. Hera, p. 2101, and s.v. Juno, p. 501); or at any rate he would hardly have jumped at the conclusion that the mysterious flight of Juno in the legend attached to that festival was a flight from the pressing attentions of Jupiter-who is not so much as mentioned by Ovid. I fear we must still return a verdict of 'not proven' in weighing all attempts to show that before the influence of Greek ideas was felt in Italy there was any distinct tendency at Rome to group the gods in family relations. We may be surprised indeed at this; it seems natural to expect that the Roman's family life should be reflected in his ideas of his gods. But in antiquity we do not always find what we expect. There are some few traces in Italy of pairs of deities, as appears from Gellius xiii. 22; but these are so obscure that we do not know in what sense we are to understand the conjunction of Lua Saturni, Maia Volcani, Nerio Martis, and the rest. It is preposterous to see in such combinations a reflex of Roman family life ;2 if that were so, we should have something more surviving than obscure names-we should surely have myths, proverbs, and some more obvious indication in the cult. Surely, in order to realize family ties in their supernatural world, the Romans must have proceeded much further on the way towards anthropomorphism than we have any reason to suppose they had done when they came under Greek influences. It should never be forgotten that at no period were they really interested in the gods 1 Myth. Lex. s.v. Juno, p. 590. The text of Pluwtarch is no doubt uncertain in at least one sentence of this Q&amp;taestio. But, corrupt or not, no one who reads it carefully will be likely to attach any weight to the words quoted by Roscher. 2 As is done e.g. in the most reckless manner by A. Zinzow, Der Vater-begriff bei den RImischen aottheiten, p. 7.

But in these notes I wish to limit myself at present to the question whether anything we know of the Flamen and Flaminica Dialis can fairly be used as evidence for the conception of a wedded pair among the Roman gods. I will merely remark in conclusion that a better idea of the true relation of Jupiter and Juno is probably to be found in the article on Hercules (Myth. Lex. pp. 2258 foll.), based on the researches of Reifferscheid: and a more probable account of the significance of the Flamen and his wife in Mr. Frazer's invaluable Golden Bough, which seems not to have reached the hands of Dr. Roscher and his associates when the articles on Jupiter and Juno were being prepared.
