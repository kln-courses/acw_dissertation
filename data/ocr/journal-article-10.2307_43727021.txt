In an introduction, Porter, the editor of the volume, explains that the need for such a reassess- ment arose from both a reexamination of old data and the discovery of new materials. The predominant view among Assyriologists since the early days of the discipline was that ancient Mesopotamians conceived of their gods primarily in anthropomorphic form, "as great divine beings with personalities and active lives, much like humans in their form and behavior" (p. 1), an understanding that has been influenced primarily by the depiction of gods in Mesopotamian myths. This perception has been propagated by the classic works in the field, such as Thorkild Jacobsen 's The Treasures of Darkness : A History of Mesopo- tamian Religion (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1976) and Jean Bottéro's Religion in Ancient Mesopotamia (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001), and is reflected in contemporary textbooks, such as Wolfram von Soden's The Ancient Orient : An Introduction to the Study of the Ancient Near East (trans. Donald G. Schley; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1994) and Georges Roux's Ancient Iraq (2nd ed.; New York: Penguin, 1980). These and other works present the ancient Mesopotamian deities as anthropomorphic, either male or female, almost without exception. There is, however, "a surprising amount of evidence" that "suggests that ancient Mesopotamian ideas of deity were not so exclusively anthropo- morphic as is usually assumed" (p. 4). Much of this evidence is in the already long-known texts containing Mesopotamian myths, hymns, and prayers. In addition, visual images rep- resent the gods not just as divine persons but also as animals and objects (p. 6). P. concludes that "such evidence makes one wonder if the long-standing emphasis on the anthropomor- phic nature of Mesopotamian gods has perhaps led us to underestimate the complexity of Mesopotamian concepts of the divine" (p. 6). As new editions of these key texts have been published and the relevant ancient languages have come to be better understood, scholars have begun to reassess the conventional understandings of the Mesopotamian gods as strictly anthropomorphic. What Is a God? is intended to bring these revolutionary ideas to the attention of scholars in the field of Near Eastern studies as a whole. The volume consists of four essays, followed by a summary of the discussion that took place among their authors at the conference. In "Die Geschöpfe des Prometheus, Or How and Why Did the Sumerians Create their Gods?" Herman Vanstiphout reexamines the descriptions of the gods in mythical and literary texts. He explores the origin and identity of the gods, their behavior, and their influence on the cosmos and on human beings. Francesca Rochberg, in "'The Stars Their Likenesses': Perspectives on the Relation between Celestial Bodies and Gods in Ancient Mesopotamia," draws on Mesopotamian astronomical and astrological treatises, letters, and reports in order to study their descriptions of gods as celestial bodies. She also examines the relationships of the gods to both celestial bodies and astral events described in Mesopotamian sources. Tallay Ornan ("In the Likeness of Man: Reflections on the Anthropocentric Perception of the Divine in Mesopotamian Art") surveys anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic portrayals of the gods in Mesopotamian visual imagery and examines their meanings. In "Blessings from a Crown, Offerings to a Drum: Were There Non-Anthropomorphic Deities in Ancient Mesopotamia?" P. surveys and appraises the evidence for non-anthropomorphic deities in Mesopotamia. Points of disagreement among the presenters are evident in the papers. For example, there was no agreed-upon definition for several key terms for the discussion, including the</page><page sequence="3">192 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 73,2011 words "god" and "anthropomorphic" (p. 11). In addition, the different genres on which each participant concentrated led to varying conclusions about how Mesopotamians conceived of the gods (pp. 10-11). The varying portrayals of gods in the different media may suggest that there was not a singular, monolithic conception in ancient Mesopotamia of what a god was, even during a narrow time frame or in a narrow geographical area. A final section of the book, entitled "Highlights of the Discussion," contains excerpts of discussions in which the authors engaged in order to compare and discuss their different conclusions about how Mesopotamians envisioned their gods. P. suggests that the often intense discussion and dis- agreements "may well prove to be the project's most important contribution to future research," since they "point to problems that future studies must address if we are ever to understand the nature of Mesopotamian gods" (p. 10). This is a fascinating collection of essays that could revolutionize the way ancient Mesopotamian religion has conventionally been understood and that those studying ancient Near Eastern religion will want to read.
