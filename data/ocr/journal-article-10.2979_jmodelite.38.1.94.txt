<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> “His Guts Are All out of Him”:   Faulkner’s Eruptive Animals Christina M. Colvin Emory University Reading Go Down, Moses through the lens of recent work in animal studies dem- onstrates not only Faulkner’s environmental ethics but, more specifically, the ways in  which his fictional representations of animal life resist appropriation by human systems  of instrumental use and abuse. Faulkner’s narrative strategy, I argue, foregrounds how  nonhuman and human animals are subject to violence once they are named “animal” and  underscores how the animal as an abstract concept fails to critically or ethically account  for the diverse lives of actual animals. At the level of Faulkner’s own prose, animals  erupt from their confinement within language and narrative to call attention to the  often reductive and violent gestures of human discourse. Keywords: animals / William Faulkner / language / materiality / violence After his dog was killed by a car in a hit-and-run accident, William Faulkner responded to the incident with a short essay titled “His Name Was Pete.” Published in the Oxford Eagle on August 15, 1946, the essay explains how  Pete, Faulkner’s fifteen-month-old pointer dog, was waiting in the road for his  mistress when he was struck, “broken and crying,” into a roadside ditch (“Pete”  202). Compounded with the car driver’s hurry to get home, Faulkner attributes  Pete’s death and the driver’s apathy to Pete’s being “ just a dog”: in this brief  piece, Faulkner refers to Pete as “ just” or “only” a dog three times to emphasize  his lack of social, legal, and moral standing. Despite his dog’s marginal status as  an animal, Faulkner nevertheless holds up for sustained attention the corporeal  pleasures Pete enjoyed in life: “earth to run on; air to breathe, sun and rain in their  seasons,” as well as food “given with affection — a touch of a hand” (201). These  pleasures demonstrate not just that Pete fully experienced the world, but that his  embodied relation to the earth, air, the seasons, and friendly touch resists any  simple reduction to the abstraction “ just a dog.” By contrasting Pete’s negligible  status with his particular, bodily reality, Faulkner suggests that Pete’s existence  was irreducible to the ontological category “animal” that made him available to  be run over with impunity.1 </page> <page sequence="2"> Faulkner’s Eruptive Animals 95 Beyond “His Name Was Pete,” Faulkner’s fictional canon underscores how  the social construction of animals, and particularly the language used to margin- alize and thereby harm animals, elides their diverse, material lives. As Faulkner  demonstrates, too, the lack of ethical consideration for social others marked as  “animal” determines how real, material bodies and lives are treated. I argue that  Faulkner critiques the divide between the ontological category “animal” and  the lived, embodied lives of material animals: the running, growling, thrash- ing, bleeding, and unmistakably vibrant creatures in Faulkner’s work breach the  abstracting and appropriative systems of representation that attempt to contain  them. As a result, Faulkner’s animals call for renewed critical attention to animal  lives in literature and in the world. Critics such as Jay Watson have productively theorized Faulkner’s exploration  of the tensions between lived experience, fleshy embodiment, and the discursive  systems and practices of language that attempt to capture a lived, material world.2  As Addie Bundren of As I Lay Dying famously attests, “words are no good . . .  words dont ever fit even what they are trying to say at” (171), an issue Faulkner’s  work continually engages on the levels of style and plot. If the complexities of  lived experience are incommensurate with the words available to describe them,  as Addie suggests, we may read in much of Faulkner’s work an illustration of this  very struggle to communicate or to represent the material world — including ways  in which material bodies relate, interact, and touch — through the inadequate and  insufficient means of language. Faulkner’s effort to represent animals in part as  members of lived, material worlds invites an interrogation of the ways Faulkner’s  animals resist human systems of discourse. All too often, however, Faulkner’s critics tend to restrict their analyses to  animals’ symbolic value or to the ways in which they reveal something about  Faulkner’s human characters.3 Such readings risk reproducing the divide between  “the animal” as a concept and animals as living creatures, a binary that Faulkner’s  work otherwise deconstructs. Insights from work in the emergent field of animal  studies can help correct this critical oversight. In his hallmark The Animal That  Therefore I Am, Derrida calls the reduction of “every living thing that is held not  to be human” to the category of “the animal” a gesture that ignores differences  among species such as those, say, between the lizard and the dog, a protozoon  and the dolphin, and the shark and the lamb (Derrida 31, 34). What inspires  Derrida’s meditation on animals, curiously enough, is his encounter with a living  animal, his own pet cat: My cat . . . does not appear to represent, like an ambassador, the immense symbolic  responsibility with which our culture has always charged the feline race. . . . If I say  ‘it is a real cat’ that sees me naked, this is to mark its unsubstitutable singularity.  . . . [I]t comes to me as this irreplaceable living being that one day enters my space,  into this place where it can encounter me, see me, even see me naked. . . . [W]hat  we have here is an existence that refuses to be conceptualized. (9) </page> <page sequence="3"> 96 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 38, Number 1 As Derrida avows here, his cat is not the animal, but an animal: she is not rep- resentative of all cats, but is instead a single, actual cat. This deceptively simple  and literally naked meeting between human and animal pivots away from the  history of Western philosophy that can only speak generally about the animal — a  category always-already differentiated from the human — to speaking about the  unique and embodied lives of animals. The strategy of reading animals as simple figures for human ideas, histories,  or behaviors stems from the binarism differentiating animals’ subhuman “charac- teristics” from human universals. Desirable attributes such as subjectivity, agency,  and language have been assigned to the exclusive purview of the human, whereas  qualities such as savagery and irrationality are associated with the animal. Yet  such a violent anthropocentrism mobilizes the discourse of the animal against  nonhuman and human animals alike. As Cary Wolfe explains, this anthropo- centrism or “institution of speciesism” “relies on the tacit agreement that the full  transcendence of the ‘human’ requires the sacrifice of the ‘animal’ and the animal- istic, which in turn makes possible a symbolic economy in which we can engage  in what Derrida will call a ‘noncriminal putting to death’ of other humans as well  by marking them as animal” (6). Enabled by the categories of the animal and the  human in general, speciesism functions as a discourse of exclusion whereby the  privileges accorded to the human are denied to all creatures, human or nonhu- man, marked “animal.”4 Like Derrida’s cat, Faulkner’s material animals resist the  “immense symbolic responsibility” imposed by discourse (Derrida 9).5 By attend- ing to the diverse and complex functions of animals in Faulkner’s work, including  their portrayal as embodied creatures, literary animal studies can help overcome  the critical tendency to read animals on a strictly abstract or metaphorical level. For a novel primarily studied for its exploration of race relations in the post- Civil War American South, nonhumans crowd the intertwined narratives of  Faulkner’s 1942 collection Go Down, Moses. Horses; squirrels; bucks; does; mules;  bears; a snake; a fox; a colt; several varieties of dog (pets, hounds, and fyce dogs);  two legendary beasts, the mongrel Lion and the giant bear Old Ben; as well as  innumerable references to other animals both wild and domestic comprise the  expansive bestiary of the novel. I suggest that Go Down, Moses attends to the  rapidly changing boundaries of what constitutes human and animal prior to  and in the aftermath of the American Civil War, boundaries that remap social  and ethical terms of relation between white and black and human and nonhu- man. To depict such radical shifts, Moses both invokes and challenges forms of  representation that generalize lives under the name of the animal. THE RHETORIC OF SPECIESISM AND HUMANS CALLED ANIMAL The first of the two sections of “Pantaloon in Black,” the story located at the  center of Go Down, Moses, opens as Rider, a black man “better than six feet” tall  and weighing “better than two hundred pounds,” shovels mounds of dirt atop  his dead wife’s grave. The section concludes as Rider, drunk from bootlegged  </page> <page sequence="4"> Faulkner’s Eruptive Animals 97 whiskey and full of grief, kills a white man after catching him cheating at dice  (Moses 129). In the second and final section of the story, a sheriff ’s deputy sits  in his kitchen as his wife cooks supper. As he recovers from the previous two  days, the deputy reviews the events that culminated in the lynching of a black  prisoner, saying: Them damn niggers . . . I swear to godfrey, it’s a wonder we have as little trouble with  them as we do. Because why? Because they ain’t human. They look like a man and  they walk on their hind legs like a man, and they can talk and you can understand  them and you think they are understanding you, at least now and then. But when it  comes to the normal human feelings and sentiments of human beings, they might  just as well be a damn herd of wild buffaloes. (147) Within the context of Faulkner’s larger critique of reductive social catego- ries, the deputy’s use of racist language is immediately recognizable; because his  language also relies on the category of the animal, this moment calls attention to  Faulkner’s interest in speciesist language as well. “Pantaloon in Black” may seem  an odd place to analyze Faulkner’s animals given that narratives such as “The  Bear” and “The Old People” feature them more prominently. Nevertheless, the  sheriff’s deputy demonstrates how the language of the animal marginalizes human  social others the same way it marginalizes animals. In Rider’s case, the grief,  confusion, and outrage over his wife’s sudden death — perhaps the very feelings  that led Rider to kill a white man — are dismissed as complex emotions impossible  for “the animal.” The deputy misreads Rider’s devastation as an absence of feeling  symptomatic of his race’s “inhumanity.” The figure of the black race as a “herd of  wild buffaloes” emphasizes this point: any single animal is both substitutable for  and emblematic of the wild and identically-minded herd (147). Missing from the  deputy’s generalization is any possibility of encountering Rider as an embodied  agent capable of varied responses to lived experience. What makes speciesism particular as a discourse of exclusion and subjugation  is its naturalization of the status of the animal as ontologically available for killing  or for harm, and the deputy’s proclamation carries the force of this violent implica- tion.6 Indeed, when the deputy equates black persons with buffaloes, he recalls the  decimation of the American bison population in the late nineteenth century. The  United States Army both supported and participated in this extensive slaughter  as part of a strategy to force Native Americans, dependent on the buffalo for food  and material, into starvation or onto reservations (Smits 317). General William  Sherman, famous for his fiery destruction of civilian property during the Civil  War, reportedly remarked that, “the quickest way to compel the Indians to settle  down into civilized life was to send ten regiments of soldiers to the plains, with  orders to shoot buffaloes until they became too scarce to support the redskins”  (qtd. in Smits 317). The history of the American bison and the history of racial- ized marginalization are therefore inextricably linked, and the deputy’s metaphor  unites two kinds of “animals” — the buffalo and the black race — as both killable  on the grounds of securing white authority. </page> <page sequence="5"> 98 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 38, Number 1 The deputy’s speciesist language not only demonstrates this story’s impor- tance as a point of entry into Faulkner’s critique of the language of the animal,  but also brings Faulkner’s concern with the treatment of animals into conversation  with his better-known interrogation of racial categories. For Faulkner, binaristic  language endangers the ethical standing of both humans and nonhumans. As he  illustrates in “Was,” the first story of Go Down, Moses, the corporeal particularity  and embodied lives of beings named “animal” have the potential to resist such  discursive confinement. “Damn the fox” — Uncle Buck’s muttered curse against a wild ani- mal — roughly bookends the comic story of “Was” (7, 30). Loosed from his cage,  the fox runs from room to room in Buck and Buddy’s house, and with the brothers’  hounds in pursuit, the fox finally “trees” behind the clock on the bedroom mantel.  To compare the reductive gestures of “human” and “animal” with those of “white”  and “black,” “Was” draws an immediate connection between the escaped fox and  the runaway slave Tomey’s Turl: both escape confinement at the story’s outset,  and both endeavor to evade re-capture by the brothers. The identical language  used to describe the flight of the fox and the flight of the slave — that of “treeing,”  “denning,” and having a “good race” — likewise makes explicit the narrative’s  comparison of the two “hunts.” This is more than a simple thematic or comic  link: the story’s white characters use their experience hunting animals to predict  Turl’s actions. Uncle Buck in particular equates Turl with the fox when he assumes  they share an incapacity for improvised response. When Buck tells young Isaac  McCaslin that Turl is “going to earth. We’ll cut back to the house and head him  before he can den” (18), he describes the chase in terms of a foxhunt to imply that  Turl is a similarly predictable object of pursuit. Thus “[d]amn the fox” (5) means  damn the animal and the slave all at once: the known character of foxes, like the  known character of slaves, dictates that they will try to run. Following the connection between fox and slave to its logical conclusion,  then, Buck and Buddy should know Tomey’s Turl to the same extent they claim  to know the fox. During the hunt, Buck chastises himself for forgetting “what  even a little child should have known: not ever to stand right in front of or right  behind a nigger when you scare him; but always to stand to one side of him” (19).  For Buck, a grasp of the fundamental patterns of slave behavior are so basic that  “even a little child” should possess them. Yet, despite the known range of slave  behavior, Turl disrupts his experienced pursuers’ hunting methods. Specifically,  Turl thwarts Buck’s hunting strategy by acting unlike himself, that is, unlike a  “nigger”: during his flight, he “should have jumped down and run for it afoot  as soon as he saw them. But he didn’t; maybe Tomey’s Turl had been running  from Uncle Buck for so long that he even got used to running away like a white  man would do it” (9). This assessment avows that it is impossible for Tomey’s  Turl to behave as an individual. Even in the face of his ingenuity, Turl’s pursu- ers try to order his behavior according to the very generalized characterizations  he repeatedly violates, the “nigger” option representing how he “should” act, yet  inexplicably does not (9). </page> <page sequence="6"> Faulkner’s Eruptive Animals 99 Though supposedly animal in his knowability, Turl’s unpredictable actions  contest his masters’ dismissal of his individual qualities, and near the story’s end,  Turl’s unpredictable body further challenges the legibility of species and racial  categories. As the white men play a game of cards to decide their future and the  future of their slaves, the language of how Tomey’s Turl “should have” conformed  to the white men’s expectations reappears (9). Hubert Beauchamp, suspicious of  the card game’s proceedings, tilts the lamp-shade up to reveal the “first creature  . . . animal, mule, or human” the men found to deal ten cards: Tomey’s Turl (27).  As Hubert guides the lamp, its light moves “up Tomey’s Turl’s arms that were sup- posed to be black but were not quite white, up his Sunday shirt that was supposed  to be white but wasn’t either” (29). Illuminated by the perceptive “light” of the  white man, the light that orders bodies according to the discourse of racial differ- ence, Tomey’s Turl’s very flesh breaches the discourse that determines his social  position, the language of categories that is “supposed to” contain his body (29). As “Was” concludes, the fox linked to Tomey’s Turl escapes again, and  Uncle Buck curses it. The humorous repetition of the animal’s flight implies that  Buck and Buddy will persist in their comfortable routine regardless of the events  depicted by the story. However, the fox’s continued escapes recall the curious  inversion of fates at the story’s end whereby Buck finds himself newly confined  within an undesired marriage to Sophonsiba Beauchamp while Tomey’s Turl  enters into a long sought-after marriage with his lover, Tennie. Just as the fox  breaks out of his cage, so does Tomey’s Turl break from confinement in white  discourse: by evading and outsmarting his pursuers, he not only wins the abil- ity to marry Tennie, but also affirms that his individual characteristics remain  irreducible to the racial and behavioral categories on which the brothers depend.  The narrative’s comparison between the fox and Turl persists not to characterize  Turl as a knowable, dismissible “animal,” but to suggest that the language of the  animal, like the language of white and black, fails to account for the embodied  existences of nonhuman and human animals.7 FAULKNER’S ERUPTIVE ANIMALS, OR   WHY IKE SHOULD HAVE HATED AND FEARED LION While both “Was” and “Pantaloon in Black” address the language of the animal  by highlighting the violence it legitimates against human characters, the second  half of Go Down, Moses critiques the ways such language marginalizes, speaks for,  and animalizes animals. Faulkner demonstrates how habitat loss and overhunting  require that new narratives account for the rapid destruction of animals, and the  events of “The Bear” and “Delta Autumn” in particular trace a significant shift  in the discursive production of the category of the animal. As modern industry  encroaches into formerly “wild” spaces and the number of game animals declines,  hunters gradually abandon the language of the “immortal” animal in favor of the  language of the insignificant, killable animal. This shift not only testifies to the  dangerous resiliency of the animal as an ontological category, but also clarifies  </page> <page sequence="7"> 100 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 38, Number 1 how each of its narrative transformations persistently avoid an engagement with  embodied life. Many critics recognize “The Bear” as one of Faulkner’s achievements in sym- bolic representation. In his classic study, for example, John Lydenberg explains  that the titular bear Old Ben, the “Great Beast, the bear that is more than a bear,”  stands for the hunters’ “relation to Nature and thus to life” (65). Although Old Ben  does serve a mythic function for his pursuers, the hunters themselves modify the  bear’s status as symbol when they need to justify killing him. Old Ben’s reputa- tion as “more than a bear,” in other words, cannot be sustained, and in the fourth  summer Isaac “Ike” McCaslin spends with the hunting party led by Major de  Spain, General Compson, and Sam Fathers, Ike witnesses the devolution of Old  Ben from an immortal bear to a mortal one (Lydenberg 65). When Sam discov- ers one of Major de Spain’s colts missing and the colt’s mother frantic with fear,  Sam reports the colt’s absence to de Spain, and the men realize only a very large  and powerful animal could have separated the colt from its mother. In response  to Fathers’s news, de Spain declares: It was Old Ben . . . I’m disappointed in him. He has broken the rules. I didn’t think  he would have done that. He has killed mine and McCaslin’s dogs, but that was all  right. We gambled the dogs against him; we gave each other warning. But now he  has come into my house and destroyed my property, and out of season too. He broke  the rules. (202) Major de Spain’s reaction — that Old Ben “broke the rules” — reveals the illogic  by which he and his fellow hunters have rationalized their annual hunting expe- dition and mythologized the animals they pursue. The men fantasized that Old  Ben, famous for his long life, ability to evade hunters and their dogs, and one foot  mutilated by a trap, played by “rules” that included those of property, hunting  season, fair warning, and which animals count as prey. Such an imaginative con- struction of the bear presents an animal who is not simply anthropomorphized,  but whose mythic status depends on its not acting like a bear. As illustrated by  Major de Spain’s disappointment, Old Ben’s existence as an actual, living bear  does not “fit” the myth constructed about him. In the hunters’ collective imagination, the idealized “rules” applicable to Old  Ben also extend to the natural world and its other animal inhabitants.8 Typically  separate from men, the Big Woods is an realm Ike considers the hunters’ willing  accomplice in their yearly expedition. Both animals and hunters find themselves  “ordered and compelled by and within the wilderness in the ancient and unre- mitting contest according to the ancient and immitigable rules which voided  all regrets and brooked no quarter” (181–2). In addition to its facilitation of the  annual “contest,” the forest’s the measureless size prevents the men’s actions from  affecting it. Each season, the Woods stand as a “tall and endless wall of dense  November woods . . . sombre, impenetrable,” the surrey which carries the men  “dwarfed by that perspective into an almost ridiculous diminishment . . . as a soli- tary small boat hangs in lonely immobility . . . in the infinite waste of the ocean”  </page> <page sequence="8"> Faulkner’s Eruptive Animals 101 (184–5). Ike and the hunters construct the Big Woods as an inexhaustible resource  they can enter, exploit, and exit without consequence, all with the Woods’ own  approval. The narrative of immortal Nature thereby legitimates the hunters’ ritual  by sharply dividing the material reality of the forest from the mythic Big Woods. Ultimately, however, Faulkner’s narrative depicts the hunters’ failure to sus- tain the myth of the Big Woods when confronted by material realities they can- not ignore: specifically, the disappearance of game animals and the elimination  of their habitats. Just as the death of Major de Spain’s colt violates the narrative  surrounding Old Ben, likewise does the Mississippi Delta’s receding wilderness  trouble the hunters’ claims about the Woods’ infinite scope. The events of “The  Bear” are largely set in the decade of 1880–1890, and the destructive forces that  impinge on the narrative’s wilderness are comparable to those that destroyed  the forested areas that still remained at the time of Faulkner’s writing. Through  an analysis of the geographical details in Faulkner’s work, Charles Aiken sug- gests that “Faulkner’s theme in ‘The Bear’ — that landscape change cannot be  halted or even arrested once a land use is outmoded and altering forces are set  in motion — was based in part on his attempt to preserve the past at Stone’s  camp” (166). With reference to the hunting camp that belonged to the family of  Faulkner’s friend and mentor, Aiken explains that, by the mid-1930s, few large  wilderness areas remained in the Yazoo Delta, and over-hunting and deforestation  caused much of the wildlife to disappear (166). In response, Faulkner helped orga- nize the Okatoba Hunting and Fishing Club to aid and assist in “the preservation  of game and fish on the lands on which the corporation shall acquire hunting  and fishing privileges” (166). The club ultimately failed to fulfill its mission of  preservation, however, and as Aiken writes, “in 1937 the Stone family disposed  of the land on which the hunting camp was located, the timber rights were sold,  and the wilderness was logged” (166). Faulkner’s failed attempt to preserve his beloved wilderness in the face of  modern industrialization is echoed in the plan invented by General Compson  and Walter Ewell near the end of “The Bear” to “corporate themselves, the old  group, into a club and lease the camp and the hunting privileges of the woods,”  a plan that even young Ike McCaslin recognizes “for the subterfuge it was . . .  a baseless and illusory hope” (300). Despite his skepticism, Ike finds the extent  of the lumber company’s destruction difficult to reconcile with his image of the  Big Woods. Less than two years after the death of Old Ben, Ike feels shock and  “grieved amazement” upon returning to the old hunting camp: where the vast for- est once stood, Ike sees “a new planing-mill, already half completed which would  cover two or three acres and what looked like miles and miles of stacked steel rails  . . . and wire corrals and feeding-troughs for two hundred mules at least and the  tents for the men who drove them” (302–3). The sheer quantity of material things  Ike observes and the determinable distances of forested land they would traverse  conflicts with his earlier estimation of the wilderness as “impenetrable” and  “infinite,” measurability itself challenging the ideal of a boundless Nature (184,  5). In an attempt to “hide himself . . . once more” from the reality the amassed  </page> <page sequence="9"> 102 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 38, Number 1 materials impose, Ike flees the area of the mill “rapidly” and “d[oes] not look any  more” on the scene (304). As the lumber industry’s destructive technologies advance on the Southern  landscape, the old ways of understanding and of representing the wilderness  gradually become ineffectual. In an interview, Faulkner described Old Ben and  the woods he occupied as “obsolete,” explaining “change is going to alter what  was . . . change must destroy . . . the splendid, fine things which are a part of  man’s past, too, part of man’s heritage, too. But they were obsolete and had to go”  (Faulkner at Virginia). For Old Ben in particular, obsolescence and having “to go”  means becoming available for killing. To better account for reality, then, the hunt- ers begin to shift their definition of “the animal” to mean all nonhuman creatures  mundane, undifferentiated, and expendable, and Faulkner emphasizes the loss of  animal life that follows in the wake of this shift. After de Spain declares that Old  Ben broke the rules, the narrator dwells on the visceral reality of the colt’s scat- tered remains: its throat is “torn out and the entrails and one ham [is] partly eaten,”  and it “lay not as if it had been dropped, but if it had been struck and hurled” (203).  The brutality of the scene starkly contrasts with the previous pastoral descriptions  of the woods and the hunting camp. When material reality empties a symbol of  its significance (in this case, what Old Ben used to represent), the literal erupts  as so many bloody entrails on the ground. This moment of material emergence  initiates Old Ben’s movement from signifying the bear to just a bear. Even after the hunters discover that the colt died in the jaws of Lion, the  great blue-colored mongrel dog “better than thirty inches” tall with “cold yellow  eyes” and “an almost impersonal malignance like some natural force,” Old Ben  does not have his “immortality” restored (207). Instead, Lion’s arrival announces  the impending death of Old Ben both as a figure and as a living creature, the  men soon hailing Lion as the dog who would finally hold the giant bear at bay.  The dog’s appearance recalls Ike’s recognition that Old Ben, despite the stories  told about him, was “a mortal animal and that they had departed for the camp  each November with no actual intention of slaying it, not because it could not  be slain but because so far they had no actual hope of being able to” (190). Lion  presents the hunters with the means to kill Old Ben, and his arrival presages the  work of the lumber company: both facilitate the destruction of what was once  constructed as eternal and immortal. Despite the hunters’ incorporation of Lion  into the lore surrounding Old Ben, however, the dog quickly challenges their  attempt to turn him into another symbolic animal: that is, from his first intru- sion into the narrative amid a trail of gore, Lion’s brute, embodied reality resists  conceptual appropriation. The narrator of “The Bear” insists repeatedly that Ike “should have hated and  feared Lion,” I would argue, not only because the dog can successfully hold the  bear, but also because he condemns to failure Ike’s romanticization of Old Ben  and the Big Woods. Ike never fully processes the extent to which the impend- ing environmental destruction will challenge his way of thinking: “[i]t was the  beginning of the end of something, he didn’t know what except that he would  </page> <page sequence="10"> Faulkner’s Eruptive Animals 103 not grieve. He would be humble and proud that he had been found worthy to be  a part of it too or even just to see it too” (214). Despite his recognition that “the  end of something” draws near, Ike persists in ordering Lion’s presence in the  camp within a meaningful structure, one in which a metaphysical force finds Ike  “worthy” to witness the end (214). Ike should hate and fear Lion, too, because the  dog’s distinctly animal reality disrupts Ike’s narrative. As he observes the dog, Ike  discovers an absence of meaning when Lion returns his look: Then the dog looked at him. It moved its head and looked at him across the trivial  uproar of the hounds, out of the yellow eyes . . . free . . . of meanness or generosity  or gentleness or viciousness. They were just cold and sleepy. Then it blinked, and he  knew it was not looking at him and never had been, without even bothering to turn  its head away. (225) Meeting Lion’s yellow eyes, Ike struggles to find evidence that Lion recognizes  his own significance within the legend of the Big Woods. Rather than a trait or  affect discernible as “meanness or generosity or gentleness or viciousness,” Ike  sees, quite simply, the eyes of an animal, opaque and unreadable: “cold and sleepy”  (225). Ike perceives no metaphoric or anthropomorphic significance in Lion’s  look: Ike can only describe what he sees; he cannot attribute meaning to what he  sees. When Ike then concludes that Lion “was not looking at him and never had  been” (225), all possibility for communication between Ike and the dog is lost.  Lion neither confirms Ike’s place in the ordered wilderness nor does he convey an  understanding of his role in Ike’s story, and his unreadable animal look attests to  a material life unappropriated by human systems of meaning. Rather than allow  Lion to unsettle him, however, Ike determines the dog was never looking at him  in the first place. As if to reinforce his challenge to preexisting structures of signification,  eruptions of grisly, bodily, material detail bookend Lion’s appearance in the nar- rative. Major de Spain’s slaughtered colt and its bloody entrails declare Lion’s  arrival, and animal bodies turned inside-out characterize the manner of Lion’s  death. After Old Ben and Lion’s final confrontation, all three carriers of the  “taintless and incorruptible” blood of the Big Woods perish: bear, dog, and old  Sam Fathers die almost simultaneously (181). For Ike, all blood passed down from  then on will be “tainted,” gesturing to the racial mixing and the disappearance of  the Big Woods that Ike faces years later in “Delta Autumn.” More immediately,  Lion’s grisly death reveals how the bodies of animals violently disrupt the hunters’  abstractions. Boon Hogganbeck’s hysterical reaction to Lion’s evisceration sounds  the literal’s intrusion into the idealized woods: Boon demands, again and again,  “[c]ant you see his guts are all out of him?” (229). Lion’s spilled intestines are  material objects of the body, and the Lion about whom Boon and his comrades  had constructed a legend suddenly becomes an actual dog (222). As Boon’s panic  illustrates, abstractions are not supposed to have guts, just as “black” slaves are  not “supposed to” have light-colored skin as Tomey’s Turl does (29). Lion’s guts  make his role as a symbolic, figural animal unsustainable. As a result, Boon’s world  </page> <page sequence="11"> 104 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 38, Number 1 falls apart alongside the broken body of his dog. Without the animal figures and  familiar abstractions of white, male, Southern discourse, Faulkner’s characters  are forced to contend with the fact that their fantasies do not match up with real- ity. The animals and people they treated as known have eluded their conceptual  grasp all along. Years later in “Delta Autumn,” the destructive forces that were beginning  to transform the woods in “The Bear” have since stripped the land of its former  breadth and diversity of life. Hunters drive long distances out of town (in their  cars rather than wagons) to reach wooded areas still populated by game animals.  Even in these locations, game remains scarce, and the aging Ike McCaslin feels  nostalgia for the time when a “man shot a doe or a fawn as quickly as he did a  buck” (319). Moreover, the “long hooting of locomotives” replaces the “scream  of panther” (324): modernization has finally collapsed the fictive divide between  the world of men and Nature. As anticipated in “The Bear,” too, years of environ- mental degradation have eroded the hunters’ once-grand narratives about animals,  and only Ike maintains a fidelity to the old ways of thinking. To legitimate their hunting activities in the wake of habitat loss, the new  generation of men speaks of game animals in terms of the animals’ unimportance.  The last appearance of an animal in Faulkner’s collection is a felled deer, one which  Will Legate, a young hunter, refers to as “ just a deer . . . nothing extra” (347).  Recalling the prohibition on killing does, Ike laments to himself, “It was a doe.”9  Even a protected animal can be killed without reservation (347). Importantly,  too, the old and the new narratives about animals have in common a separation  between the categories of human and animal. Whereas the idealization of Old  Ben insisted on a spatio-geographic separateness between human and animal  worlds, the narrative of the mere animal distinguishes human from animal on  the basis of the latter’s violable body. A melancholic tone resonates throughout  “Delta Autumn,” and beyond Ike’s nostalgia for the fictive Big Woods, the bar- ren land depopulated of life testifies to the devastating effect of neglecting the  concerns of animals. As in “His Name Was Pete,” the language of “ just” an animal that concludes  Go Down, Moses suggests Faulkner’s sustained investment in categorical dismiss- als of animal life. Despite his renowned experiments with language, narrative  structures, and intricate figures, embodied, actual animals persist as facets of  lived reality that words — even Faulkner’s words — do not “fit.” As a text about  the literal and discursive marginalization of vibrant lives, including those lives  named “animal,” Go Down, Moses calls our attention to how strategies of writing  and reading for other-than-human concerns might transcend and transform social  and species barriers alike. Indeed, Faulkner’s reputation for a body of work that  interrogates the social, cultural, and discursive structures that harm people makes  him a known humanitarian; his critique of the violent language of the animal  reveals he is also humane. </page> <page sequence="12"> Faulkner’s Eruptive Animals 105 Notes 1. I have in mind Donna Haraway’s suggestion in When Species Meet that an ethical response to  an animal or animals neither determines in advance the ontological status of those in relation (by  separating animals and humans into the categories of those who may be killed and those who may  not, respectively), nor does it naively disavow that both humans and animals exist within a complex  mortal web of living and dying. Making the animal merely killable forecloses ethical calculation  and critical, responsible thought. 2. Watson has rightly called attention to “the literal” in Faulkner’s work as a way to explore moments  in which the material or natural world escapes or exceeds confinement within systems of discourse. In  his analysis, the power of blood as a metaphor signifying race, character, and behavior in Faulkner’s  South contributes significantly to Joe Christmas’s death in Light in August, his imagined black blood  prefiguring his guilt. I take seriously Watson’s examination of “the literal” in Faulkner’s work and  want to further argue that the fleshy bodies and worldly beings that appear in Faulkner’s novels often  do so not simply as metaphors. 3. In their respective analyses of The Hamlet, for example, both Gail Mortimer and Lorie Wat- kins Fulton provide little to no analysis of the horses and cows featured prominently in Faulkner’s  novel. Instead, they read animals as figures for the human. Mortimer’s reading in particular offers  Ike Snopes’s cow as a metaphor for Eula Snopes and for the feminine more generally. 4. Wolfe’s discussion of the discourse of speciesism may be productively brought into conversation  with Agamben’s concept of the “anthropological machine.” The machine marks what is “human” and  “animal” both in order to define the human in opposition to the animal (by locating the parts of the  human that cannot be animalized) and to generate an animalized human, or the “nonhuman within  the human” (37). Finding the nonhuman within the human may reduce the human to a form of “bare  life” against which any violence can be leveled. For an extended discussion of the anthropological  machine, see Agamben. 5. In his article on As I Lay Dying, Christopher T. White provides an important exception to the  dominant critical trend in Faulkner studies of reading animals as simply metaphors by situating an  analysis of “real” animals alongside an interrogation of human language’s relationship with inhuman  forms of communication. 6. See Haraway, When Species Meet, Chapter 3. 7. Thadious Davis adroitly explores the landmark case of Pierson v Post and its significance to  Faulkner’s narrative. A famous case in property law, Pierson involved a dispute between two hunters  over the ownership of a wild, hunted fox. As Davis explains, in Pierson “the fox was a thing to be  owned and claimed as property,” as is both the fox and Tomey’s Turl in “Was” (60). Neither fox nor  human have the authority to claim ownership of themselves: they are things to be owned. Following  Davis’s analysis, I find the language of the ruling itself pertinent for an analysis of the category of  “the animal” in Faulkner’s work, as the ruling states physical domination by way of “ensnaring” or by  “other such means which will prevent [the animal’s] escape” as necessary for claiming ownership over  an animal (57). In “Was,” physical domination is chiefly at stake in the twins’ pursuit of Tomey’s Turl  as well as their recovery of the loosed fox, and Tomey’s Turl’s physicality acts as a bodily marker for  the inefficacy of white discourse to represent his concrete, material existence. Despite the fact that  they are already spoken for by white discourse, the bodies of the fox and Tomey’s Turl are what most  clearly resist total “capture” within the discursive conventions of Buck and Buddy. 8. As Timothy Morton suggests, the very concept of nature is an invention, one that is “set up as a  transcendental, unified, independent category” despite the slipperiness of its definition (13). Morton  further illustrates the difficulty of pinning down exactly what nature is, writing that, “Nature is . . .  animals, trees, the weather . . . the bioregion, the ecosystem. It is both the set and the contents of  the set. It is the world and the entities in that world” (18). 9. The men in “Delta Autumn” exercise the word “doe” as a crude slang term for women, a contrast  with the high symbolic significance once attributed to animals and animal figures. I focus on the  </page> <page sequence="13"> 106 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 38, Number 1 language of “ just a doe” as it bears on the men’s treatment and understanding of animals, though  it is worthy of mention that Ike’s proclamation “It was a doe” can refer both to the actual felled  deer as well as to the mixed-race mother of Edmonds’ child, a so-termed “doe” to whom the men  previously refer.
