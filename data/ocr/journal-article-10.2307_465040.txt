Wo: READING THEORY: THE ROLE OF THE SEMIOTICIAN WILLIAM RAY Umberto Eco. A THEORY OF SEMIOTICS. Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1976. Umberto Eco. THE ROLE OF THE READER. Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1979. Umberto Eco's new collection of essays, The Role of the Reader, clearly wants to be looked upon as a contribution to the rapidly expanding field of reader theory in spite of the fact that most of its selections-some of which date back to the fifties and early sixties-only peripherally address the specifics of reading. This would seem authorization enough to reassess his earlier theoretical work as well in terms of its implications for a semiotic version of reading. In fact, aside from Jonathan Culler's Structur- alist Poetics [Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1975] we have no substantial book-length studies on reading from a semiotic perspective; and Eco's work, while it does not fill that gap, goes a long way toward explaining it. In effect, semiotics stands in a somewhat strange relationship to reading. To the extent that one defines reading in terms of an opposition between textual structure and cognitive activity, as a long tradition of "reader response" criticism and phenomenological theory would have it, there would seem to be no semiotic "stuff" upon which the theoretician could get a hold. Unlike natural language, reading is not possessed as an immediately and intuitively accessible competence. As Culler has shown, conventions do underlie critical reading, and one can develop a discipline for uncovering those conventions and welding them into a model of com- petence. But as the synthetic product of a collective endeavor of extrapola- tion, that competence has neither the degree of organization of linguistic competence, nor its firm hold on the subject: few are the readers who could (or would) pronounce immediately and with full certainty on the acceptability of a critical reading. Such judgment usually comes only after a close analysis of the argument and consultation with one's peers. Nevertheless, critics less averted than Culler commonly reduce reading to the textual "meaning" with which it presumably correlates. This is a perfectly acceptable move in a non-semiotic context where the distinction between system and instance is of little import, but its blurring of the difference between interpretation and systematic description challenges the semiotic claim to objectivity. If the text is a message as well as a language unto itself, an instance as well as a system, then the semiotic description of the textual system could not help but reveal itself as an interpretation as well, thereby relinquishing its oft reiterated claim to 50</page><page sequence="2">JOBii :~:i -:i~iiiiJEW ii-: :i Ci;:ii-ii~iiziiii:_ISM ~ WIN,.... i:- :1P :::ii-i-i:- ~i~i---;::-::::-':-::---l-:---r ::::-::-:----- .slog- ~~-;-:: -.-------:-:-:ii~iadiis ~ p"- 'i~i;iiii- i : :B~iiii:~;~ii:i :i: ::::: I.::-l:~~- _: __:' -?:: :: -_ :: : : :: :::-:::::: :::, Q w::::::: : .

This dilemma would obtain only in those cases where the theoretician/critic openly analogized between textual "structure" and the Saussurian concept of la langue in an attempt to banish any traces of subjective activity from the object of his inquiry. For such an analogy forces the scrutiny of the status of the text and ultimately makes its (the analogy's) author more rather than less vulnerable. From one point of view the text does seem a language unto itself: like a language, any given text permits an infinite number of messages (readings) to be generated from a finite number of combinational units. But the text is just as clearly a single message instance in the larger systems of literature and natural language-and this remains true whether one think of it as the embodiment of a (unique) authorial intention or a multiplicity of reader intentions. It is always given as an utterance as much as a system and thus confounds the reduction of the Saussurian parole/langue interface into a simply oppositional dyad. As the interface between system and instance, texts, and by extension readings, cannot be reduced to a simple identity, much less a stable structure. They will always remain as much an event as a structure, and in this sense different from themselves. Umberto Eco's ideas on interpretation and reading emblematize this dilemma. He does not hesitate to treat individual texts as self-contained languages whose range of meaning can be ascertained. At the same time, however, his general theory of semiotics precludes the delimitation of a text and its reduction to a set number of readings, semantic categories, or even sememes. Eco is attracted by the strategy of the semantic analysts, which describes the activity of reading according to the semantic fields of the text's components-that is, considers the text a tiny language whose various utterances can be recuperated on the basis of its limited number of meaning units. But paradoxically, his own theory of unlimited semiosis puts into question the feasibility of such an approach. Unlimited semiosis is the hallmark of Eco's general theory of semiotics, and very crudely paraphrased, it states that the cultural content of a given expression can only be defined in terms of abstract entities themselves cultural conventions in need of further definition by further abstact entities, ad infinitum. Each of the interpretants in this chain thus potentially links up with all others in a vast metonymic aggregation susceptible to continual reorganization and which can only be clarified in terms of its own never-ending process/structure of semiosis [A Theory of Semiotics, pp. 66-72]. From a practical point of view, this means that one can neither exhaustively describe the semantic field of a given text (although Eco shrinks back from that conclusion) nor even stay within the boundaries of that text as microlanguage. From a theoretical point of view, its merger of process and structure into one notion of ongoing restructuration puts into question the complexities of that interface. Eco's theory in fact organizes itself along the distinction between a theory of codes or signification systems and a theory of communication or sign production. In keeping with the Saussurian valorization of langue, Eco initially grants the former precedence over the latter: "a signification system is an autonomous semiotic construct that has an abstract mode of existence independent of any possible communicative act it makes possible. On the contrary [. . .] every act of communication to or between human beings [. . .] presupposes a signification system as its necessary condition" [Theory, p. 9]. Presumably this privilege of autonomy justifies the structuralist assumption that the code of a text can be outlined independently of any specific message it makes possible. Yet Eco's theory of unlimited semiosis quickly makes clear that what one calls a code is neither "a natural condition of the Global Semantic Universe nor a stable structure underlying the complex of links and branches of every semiosic process" [Theory, p. 126]. It is, rather, a momentary "magnetization" between various cultural units which is developed through repeated usage-a temporary con- figuration formed by the lines of attraction linking various sememes in our ever- changing semantic universe, or, if you will, a putting into relief of certain metonymic linkings over others. The code is thus neither a stable structure nor a natural law. It is simply a function of history-an occurrence or event. And on the microcosmic level of the text, it is clear a fortiori that "any subcode [. ..] is a comparatively transitory diacritics/March 1980 51</page><page sequence="4">phenomenon which it would be impossible to establish and describe as a stable structure" [Theory, p. 126]. In practice then, the theoretical subordination of message to code is inverted, since the structure underlying meaning cannot be abstracted from the processes which continually modify it. The compositional tree which Eco originally proposed as a means to depict the code, thus turns out to be "a purely temporary device posited in order to explain a certain message, a working hypothesis that aims to control the immediate semantic environment of given semantic units" [Theory, pp. 126-27; see also pp. 128-29]. That such a definition also fits the literary interpretation is self- evident, suggesting that the mutual solidarity between a semiotics of the code and that of sign production extends to interpretation and semiotic analysis. If the descrip- tion of a code has as its precondition the delimitation of a message, the semiotician can scarcely forego criticism. Eco pursues the implications of this suggestion by making interpretation the cornerstone of his theory of code modification. The key notion in this move is that of extra-coding, or the quasi-inferential process by which we extend present codes to cover new circumstances, thereby enriching our overall code-presuming, of course, that those extensions are accepted and become habitual [see Theory, pp. 131-33]. Eco envisions two forms of extra-coding: overcoding, which consists in either the applica- tion of preexistent conventions to cover new situations or the assignment of additional values to "macroscopic strings" of minimal coded expressions [Theory, pp. 133-34]; and undercoding, through which "in the absence of reliable preestablished rules, certain macroscopic portions of certain texts are provisionally assumed to be pertinent units of a code in formation" [Theory, pp. 135-36]. To the extent that the division of an "uncoded" text into "macroscopic portions" can hardly be assumed to occur in the absence of some code, this distinction appears superfluous: undercoding is necessarily contingent on over-coding, which term I shall retain to indicate code extensions in general. In the process of over-coding an inverse movement of complication and simplifi- cation occurs between the code and the message. As one progressively makes sense of a previously uncoded text (which in Eco's theory refers to any multi-levelled discourse [see Theory, p. 57]), one inevitably increases the complexity of the code under extension. At the same time, however, Eco sees a necessary reduction in complexity befalling the text. For interpretation has as its end the consolidation of the many semantic units of the text into a more economical figure derived from the various groupings and exchanges regulated by the growing code. To borrow a term from rhetoric, interpretation--and a fortiori reading-combines the metonymic string of textual units into a metaphoric totality. And it does so by means of the code. It is the code which assigns a tentative value to any textual unit. But since the notion of unlimited semiosis presupposes all sememes to be in potential metonymic contact with one another, the economy of exchange within which the text is thus integrated is assured of providing the linkages for the formation of a metaphor. As Eco puts it, "a metaphor can be invented because language, in its process of unlimited semiosis, constitutes a multidimensional network of metonymies, each of which is explained by a cultural convention rather than by an original resemblance [Role of the Reader, p. 78]. These metonymies can be visualized as the bifurcations of the semantic-analytic tree, the interpretant sememes which define the value of any given textual sememe and which can be traced through the endless chain of sememes which give them their value to any other sememe. Thus the generation of a "new" metaphor which ostensibly depends on the proximity of properties shared by two terms, is in fact foreseen by the code's metonymic linkages. On the other hand, once the metaphor has been "invented," its incorporation into the code as habit will necessarily realign those linkages (or rearrange all the sememic "marbles" in the Global Semantic Universe). A more precise rendering of this dialectic is provided by Eco's discussion of the aesthetic text, which in his system performs the major portion of code enrichment. For Eco, the aesthetic text is characteristically ambiguous, and thus self-focusing, 52</page><page sequence="5">precisely because it violates the rule of the code [Theory, p. 262] and thereby draws attention to both its expression plane and its content plane (and their correlation) [Theory, pp. 263-64]. More specifically, variations in the use of sign-vehicle matter such as rhyme and rhythmic patterns make such matter interesting and elevate it to the level of an "aspect of the expression form" [Theory, p. 266], causing the addressee to isolate further categories and subdivisions within a continuum which previously appeared unbroken. And because "there is a strong relation between the further segmentation of the token matter of a given sign-vehicle and the further segmentation of the expression plane of an entire semiotic system" [Theory, p. 268], the latter undergoes a sudden jump in complexity and in turn effects a similar increase in the organization of the content plane of the whole system. Reading an aesthetic text thus triggers an overall inflation in the complexity of the addressee's semantic universe: it quite literally increases one's culture. It is interesting to note that this theory attributes the continual process of code- changing to the aesthetic text as it is read by the ordinary addressee, implicitly bypassing the distinctly metacritical enterprise whose necessity Structuralist Poetics argues. While Culler's work posits the need for a separate discipline in order to reveal and ultimately enrich the conventions of reading, Eco locates the dynamics of a more general ongoing code transformation in a "first-level" interpretive activity presumed to accompany every reading to a greater or lesser degree. On the other hand, Eco's description is based on an aberrant generic distinction which Culler eschews-that of the intrinsically aesthetic text. If ambiguity and self-focusing derive from the violation of norms, any text can be made code-inventive simply by reading it according to conventions it seems to violate. Code enrichment does not depend on particular formal structures alone, but on processes of meaning production as well. But in his desire to enclose the dialectics of semiosis within a more tractable system, Eco opts for the easy closure of a generic distinction. Along similar lines, but more troubling, is his assumption that this enrichment can only occur at the expense of the text's complexity. Eco is clearly aware that the logic of his own theory leads to the conclusion that all works of art have a meaning potential in excess of any system one can impose on them, that the work "com- municates too much and therefore does not communicate at all, existing as a magic spell that is radically impermeable to all semiotic approach" [Theory, p. 270]. But reverting to the analogy of the text as langue, he postulates "an underlying system of mutual correlations" [Theory, p. 271], a single design or "systematic rule" by means of which the text's many messages can be united within a manageable category. This "precise design" again functions as the metaphoric totalization, and it performs its reduction on the basis of a perceived similarity in the way the various levels and messages of the text violate their respective systems [Theory, p. 271]. Were this notion tenable, it would make of reading a sort of code-enrichment-cum-text-consumption -a one-way flow of organizational complexity out of the work of literature into the cultural system. And indeed, from the perspective of the cultural historian, this is precisely what happens. As Eco explains, the systematic rule can be hypostatized into an "idiolect," extended to the other works of the same author, other authors of the same period, or even a whole cultural movement, to be ultimately inscribed in history [Theory, p. 272]. And it goes without saying that "insofar as it produces new norms accepted by an entire society, the artistic idiolect may act as a meta-semiotic judgment changing common codes" [Theory, p. 272]. In this way, the aesthetic work is trans- mogrified into an historical artifact, a single occurrence in a continual historical development: ambiguity is transformed into fact, meaning into knowledge, (sub)code into message. But Eco's system just as clearly argues for the opposite perspective: to the extent that the work is like a language it is not reducible to a historical fact; if it is a code, then it is a never-ending process of structuration-as much a constant happening as a one-time occurrence. The magnetization of cultural units which one historian might record as its idiolect is only a single transitory state in its being. More importantly, it is clear that to the extent the text succeeds in transforming the "common codes," it will diacritics/March 1980 53</page><page sequence="6">succeed in modifying its own identity, since that identity is inseparable from those codes. In other words, the reading of the text necessarily invalidates itself and requires a rereading productive of yet further code changes and thus yet another rereading, ad infinitum. That such a dialectic reproduces the play of parole and langue, or performance and competence, and in fact conflates the two notions within a single interfacial category, is amply underlined by Eco's own contention that the idiolect, which he initially identifies as a code, must be (two paragraphs later) understood in terms of an abstract model "which constitutes the performance of an underlying competence" [Theory, p. 272]. Under its apparently tidy dichotomy, then, A Theory of Semiotics ultimately poses a dilemma for the reading theoretician. On the one hand Eco performs a daring merger of performance and competence, code and message within a single category; on the other he slips back into the fundamentally historical framework of the "ob- jective" semiotician and submits a model which, although dialectically conceived, maintains the distinct autonomy of the code and the expendability of the message. His tentative acceptance of the inseparability of a semiotics of signification and a semiotics of communication finds its most forthright expression on the last pages of the work, where he defines semiosis in terms of a "double (systematic and processual) aspect" [Theory, p. 316]. But he refuses to relinquish the semiotician's dream of reducing everything to structure: "semiotics treats subjects of semiosic acts in the same way: either they can be defined in terms of semiotic structures or-from this point of view-they do not exist at all" [Theory, p. 316]. Although he ultimately admits the necessity of performance within the theoretical system-that is, the need for interpretation in the midst of theoretical description-he will never fully renounce the objectivist's dream. In view of the above oath of loyalty to the dearest semiotic principle, it is scarcely surprising that Eco should inaugurate The Role of the Reader with a pictorial schema outlining all of the possible acts which a reader performs in terms of the textual structures they produce-or which elicit them. (I shall limit my discussion to the first and last chapters of the book, since the intervening sections have all appeared elsewhere, scarcely cohere into an extended argument, and have only limited bearing on reading per se.) In good structuralist tradition, he produces a single chart whose ten interconnected boxes cover the textual expression, the circumstances of utterance, the codes involved in reading, and, on both the intensional and extensional levels, the various forms of actualized content resulting from reading [Role, p. 14]. These boxes are not arranged in any definite hierarchy but rather "interconnected in a continuous coming and going" [Role, p. 15] which presumably traces the reading activity as modulated by the textual structure. The most basic unit of actualized content is the discursive structure (box four) which results when "the reader confronts the linear text manifestation [box three] with the system of codes and subcodes provided by the language in which the text is written [box one]" [Role, p. 17]. This conjunction is overseen by the circumstances of utterance (box two), which include historical and biographical information about the author, historical period, social context, and purpose of the message. To produce discursive structures, the reader must actualize not only those semantic properties explicity manifested in the text, but also implement what Eco calls semantic disclosures by realizing properties only virtually present in the lexemes, but relevant to the text [Role, p. 23]. For instance, the lexeme "man" brings with it a number of anatomical properties which the reader can either "blow up," should they be immediately relevant (if the man is running, the property of having legs is automatically blown up), or "narcotize" should they be of no immediate use (such as the property of having a spleen, in the above example). Eco further specifies that the realization of all necessary semantic disclosures depends on a textual operator or topic, which, as the general frame of reference of the text, imposes the limits on the semantic disclosures and allows the formation of unified levels of sense or isotopies [Role, pp. 23-27]. In other words, "the textual topic 54</page><page sequence="7">helps the reader to select the right frames, to reduce them to a manageable format, to blow up and to narcotize given semantic properties of the lexemes to be amalgamated, and to establish the isotopy according to which he decides to interpret the linear text manifestation so as to actualize the discursive structure of a text" [Role, p. 27]. Once this is done, "the reader knows what 'happens' in a given text" [Role, p. 27]. Out of the elementary discursive structures, the reader next constructs the narrative structures or fabula (box six): "the basic story stuff, the logic of actions or the syntax of characters, the time-oriented course of events" [Role, p. 27]. This involves a correlate inferential operation of forecasting. As each successive "macro- proposition" of the fabula is formulated, "the reader is led to make an intermediate extensional operation: he considers the various macropropositions as statements about events taking place in a still-bracketed possible world [. . .] and the reader is induced to wonder what could happen at the next step of the story" [Role, p. 31]. In other words, the intertextual frames elicited by the discursive structures cause the reader to hazard a hypothesis about the outcome of the fabula. And because "to identify these frames the reader had to 'walk,' so to speak, outside the text, in order to gather intertextual support (a quest for analagous 'topoi,' themes, or motives)" [Role, p. 32], Eco locates such hypothesis formation under the extensional side of his chart and christens it inferential walks (box seven). The "possible world" projection to which such hypotheses will ultimately con- tribute forms another extensional box (the tenth), while the bracketed version of the same possible world (which has not yet been confirmed by the text) forms box five. At the level of the final possible world-which stands as the concretization of world structures resulting from reading-the reader must "recognize what the text accepts and mentions as 'actual' and what has to be recognized as a mere matter of proposi- tional attitudes on the parts both of the reader and of the characters of the story" [Role, p. 37]. Likewise, it is here that decisions of credibility, verisimilitude, and the like must be made, on the basis of a comparison between the world of the text and the reader's own "real" world [Role, p. 37]. An intensional version of box ten forms box nine in Eco's schema. It deals with ideological structures such as "Good vs. Bad, Positive vs. Negative, True vs. False, or even [. .. .] Life vs. Death and Nature vs. Culture" [Role, p. 38], but Eco concedes that it may be reducible to box ten, which he specifically formulated in order to deal with ideological problems in an extensional perspective. The last box to be mentioned is box eight: it covers the actantial structures or roles to which the fabula can be reduced. Although much of the material in Eco's brief description only restates in more rigorously semiotic terms ideas which have long been in circulation among the phenomenological and psychoanalytic theoreticians of reading, he does have the virtue of welding together the frequently opposed notions of textual structure and reader response. For each of his "boxes" at once marks a structural component of the literary text as it is actualized by the reader, and an activity of the reader as elicited by the textual structure. Since the textual structure cannot be actualized as such in the absence of the reader's performance, while that performance in turn depends upon the textual "score" to guide it, Eco's model eludes simple causal paradigms of reading: it is neither simply a production of textual structures nor a response to them. To thematize this entanglement, Eco proposes the auxiliary notion of the text's subcode, which covers not only (1) the rule which the text inherits from its parent language and (2) the particular literary competence which the reader brings to the text, but also (3) the rules governing the specific interaction of reader codes and textual codes as it occurs for that text. In other words, the competence particular to a specific text is not just the sum of two extrinsic codes, but the gradually generated product of a complex interaction. Although he is true to his system-biased heritage and careful to locate the final repository of this competence in the text, Eco nonethe- less stresses that it is the result of a process and must be "built up" through the reading itself: "the well-organized text on the one hand presupposes a model of competence coming, so to speak, from outside the text, but on the other hand works to build up, diacritics/March 1980 55</page><page sequence="8">by merely textual means, such a competence" [Role, p. 8]. A more anthropomorphic version of the same notion is supplied by Eco's variation on the perennial theme of the ideal-or in this case, Model-reader. Unlike its more historical counterparts, the Model Reader is entirely a product of the textual process which elaborates it. Conversely, "the text is nothing else but the semantic-pragmatic production of its own Model Reader" [Role, p. 10]-an appropriately equivocal formula which suspends the question of structural or processual priority between its respective embodiments. Indeed, in the light of Eco's larger theory, the text as subcode is nothing more than the product of its reading-a transitory structuration in an unending process. Conversely, the reader's activity is no more than the emergence of that subcode, its confirmation if you will. Neither is permanent, neither stable-and neither is simply the cause or origin of the other. Rather each is the other's obverse face, they are the different identities of a single notion. Eco both acknowledges and represses this conclusion. His acknowledgment comes in the form of an accession to interpretation: by making an exegesis (to which we shall turn shortly) the capstone of his theoretical speculation, he obliquely concedes the necessity of performing a code, of describing a textual structure through the very process of its elaboration in reading. His repression comes in the form of a subversion of the notion of the Model Reader/textual subcode. On the basis of a rather tired distinction between "open" and "closed" texts, he demotes the Model Reader to a mere thematic accessory to the text. "Open" texts, he declares, are those which acknowledge and invite the activity of their reader-and thereby gain a measure of control over it. "Closed" texts, on the other hand, "obsessively aim at arousing a precise response on the part of more or less precise empirical readers" and are for that reason "open to any possible 'aberrant' decoding" [Role, p. 8]. By correlating the Model Reader with those texts which thematize their addressee's activity, Eco confuses the theoretical notion of the reader/subcode as a structure/process with the more mundane idea of a thematized reader. This move justifies the inclusion in The Role of the Reader of some otherwise irrelevant articles which explore that distinction; but it also declares a methodological impasse. Apparently, Eco's roots in the structuralist tradition lead him to assume that in order to attain his goal he must locate and describe a Model Reader in the texts he studies. This is not the case, since his own theory, taken radically, would suggest that Eco's own reading would manifest that Model Reader more fully than any "objective" analysis eschewing performance for description. Nonetheless, Eco does "look for" his reader in the form of a visible thematic structure. Unfortunately, in many texts, including the detective stories, spy novels, and comic books which he favors, "one can at most guess what kind of reader their authors had in mind, not which require- ments a 'good' reader should meet" [Role, p. 19]. In such cases, the description of the Model Reader cannot get off the ground: these texts are closed, but not to reading -only to Eco's compromised program. The lengths to which the determined semiotician must go in order to circumvent this apparent stricture are graphically illustrated by Eco's final chapter, where he actually does perform-at great length-a reading of sorts. While it is clear that every text generates a Model Reader-in the original sense of the term-and that therefore any text would do for its performance/illustration, Eco nonetheless selects a short story by Alphonse Allais which is interesting primarily for its aberration. Written in 1890, Un Drame bien parisien takes the form of a short sequence of barely adumbrated events which, according to Eco, draw the reader into making erroneous assumptions which the text first repudiates and then, in a perverse turnabout, builds upon. In Eco's terminology, Drame lines up a number of discursive structures sufficiently vague to cause its reader to make some questionable inferential walks and to generate, on the basis of intertextual frames, a fabula and possible world at odds with those explicitly revealed by the final passages of the text. Specifically, the reader is led to believe that Raoul and Marguerite, a jealous married couple, are the characters in disguise at a masked ball, each of whom has assumed the disguise of the other's lover in hopes of catching his/her spouse in the act. In fact, the text does not directly 56</page><page sequence="9">authorize any of these assumptions and ultimately reveals the couple to be neither Raoul nor Marguerite-to be, rather, strangers to each other, a fact which causes them no small surprise when they demask. The last part of the story informs us that this little incident had a profound and salutary effect on Raoul and Marguerite, who lived happily ever after. A number of traditional interpretive strategies, such as Wolfgang Iser's, would allow one to account for these turnabouts in an adequate way. Eco attempts to go beyond such approaches and employ modal logic and possible world theory in order to provide a more rigorous description of the narrative structure and its Model Reader. In this heroic attempt to reduce an event/structure to a simple formulaic structure, he succeeds in compromising the most interesting part of his theory and realigning the semiotic endeavor along the axis of evaluative criticism. On the broadest level, he reduces reading to what one might call a paradigm of hypothesis formation. This occurs because he focuses almost exclusively on the question of reader expectation in the development of the fabula. But the operative concept in his reading is that of the tenth box, or possible worlds, which are here described more fully as the possible states of affairs, courses of events, and individuals endowed with various properties, which are predicated by the propositional attitudes of someone-which are, in short, "worlds imagined, believed, wished, and so on" [Role, p. 219]. And Eco's rather tautological thesis is that "when one imagines a set of individuals (and of relations among them) that the text cannot finally admit, one in fact resorts to opposing to the world of the text a possible world not accessible to it" [Role, p. 217]. This new paradigm of opposition between text and reader advances the thesis that the reader's hypotheses or tentative possible worlds are either verified or abandoned through a simple true/false decision: when one imagines a world the text cannot admit, one must simply "get rid of his world so as to accept the state of affairs established by the fabula" [Role, p. 245]. Not only does this imply that the state of affairs established by the fabula is completely determinate; it also negates the possibility of compromise or mutual determination between text and reader: "between the world of the fabula and the world of the reader's wrong forecasts, there is no accessibility. If they are wrong it is so because the reader has imagined individuals and properties that the world of the fabula could not conceive of. When the reader realizes his mistake he does not manipulate his possible (wrong) world to come back to the story. He simply throws it out" [Role, p. 246]. Such a radical discarding of one's beliefs may occur, but only on the most superficial level of the "events" outlined in the fabula; and it is only visible in the trick texts which fascinate Eco. To the extent that one's relationship vis-a-vis the more complex and ideological aspects of the fabula, such as projected moods, sentiments, thoughts, ideas, and so forth, cannot be reduced to a simple, verifiable true/false decision, Eco's model would seem hopelessly inadequate as a means of accounting for more complex works such as Proust, for instance. Most reading, even fictional reading, greatly exceeds in complexity the paradigm of hypothesis verification. In fact, Eco's own model disputes the logic of the hypothesis paradigm by its dependence on a more holistic dialectic of hermeneutic understanding. It is clear that since a text semiotics is concerned with "'pregnant' worlds of which one must know all the acting individuals and their properties" [Role, p. 218], one could scarcely implement Eco's program unless one could ascertain with certainty the presence or absence of all relevant properties. But properties are revealed by semantic disclosures regulated, we remember, by the textual topic. And that topic stands in relation to the individual lexemes, with their potentially infinite number of sememes, much the same as the hermeneutic horizon stands in reference to its theme. In other words, the development of the requisite properties depends on the singling out of pertinent lexemes and sememes, which in turn depends on the presence of a topic which can itself only be construed on the basis of a selection of pertinent lexemes. The hermeneutic circle is thus embedded within Eco's method, such that each successive portion of the text is realized against the horizon (according to the topic) of those diacritics/March 1980 57</page><page sequence="10">which preceded it. As each new "part" of the text is processed with respect to the "whole" thus far constituted, it modifies that whole: the topic is, like the subcode, a processually, dialectically developed structure/event. The important thing to retain here is that at no point is the topic simply "thrown out" or "gotten rid of." Rather it is continually modified so as to accommodate each new textual segment. (Both Wolfgang Iser, in The Act of Reading [Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1978], and Norman Holland, in 5 Readers Reading [New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1975] develop this hermeneutic paradigm of dialectical accretion extensively.) Readers do not throw away their readings, if only because, like the textual structure, those readings are not immutable structures but rather continual structurations. They are not thrown away because, by the logic of Eco's own model, they are not given in a mode sufficiently rigid for their disqualification to occur. Other inconsistencies such as this can be uncovered in Eco's reading of Drame, but none are so troubling as his lapse into the logic of evaluative criticism. When he phrases his procedure in terms of possible worlds the "text cannot finally admit," he is shifting the concern of his investigation from that of significance to that of admissibility. Rather than depicting the process/structure of semiosis "in action," as it were, he turns to isolating the deviation which readings present vis-a-vis the textual prescription. The irony of such a move is that it implicitly underwrites the notion of a stable possible world delineated by the text and thus introduces, on the heels of a theory which denies immutable structures, the concept of an immutable code. The dangers of such a move are legend. For one thing, it reintroduces the spectre of the autonomous textual object which not only Eco's theory but semiotics in general has vigorously rejected. If the text can be reduced to a restricted message [see Role, p. 206] and the possible worlds it projects correlated to a stable formal structure and limited "semantic encyclopedia," such that "accessibility (and compatibility) are not a matter of psychology, but one of objective and formal comparison between two cultural constructs" [Role, p. 225], then one has effectively hypostatized the literary work as a historical fact. And this is but one step from granting it the status of a natural object. Along similar lines, Eco goes against the best implications of his general theory by reducing his Model Reader to a third party persona distinct from the text-and from Eco himself. This not only reintroduces the aberrant schism between reading subject and textual object which his own work so skillfully eliminated, but, by blinding Eco to his own role as Model Reader (to his own performance in this chapter), asserts the pernicious notion of a "literal" level of meaning in the text. For Eco never questions the frequently suspect readings he attributes to his Model Reader and which form the foundation for his entire portrait. This is scarcely to oppose my own performance of the text to Eco's, but one example of a presumed literal meaning will suffice to illustrate to what degree he can attribute to the textual code messages which are inseparable from his production of it. Much of Eco's thesis rests on the episode when the two masked figures, having rendezvoused for an illicit night of passion, demask and discover they do not know each other. For Eco, their surprise can only be explained by the fact that they are not Raoul and Marguerite; that is, the characters' surprise can only be explained in terms of the reader's: "were the Templar and the Pirogue Raoul and Marguerite, they would have recognized each other. Were they not, they would not have reason to be astonished" [Role, p. 254, see also p. 247]. At no point does it occur to Eco that the sememe "stranger" is not necessarily synonomous with "not Raoul" or "not Marguerite." Presumably, his own cultural encyclopedia does not code as astonishing the discovery that one's escort is not in fact who one thought it was. Like the assumption of a normative possible world, the belief in a univocal textual meaning can be traced back to the need to return to the stability of a transcendent structure. Eco's theory may in fact declare all codes to be the product of an ongoing dialectic between performance and competence; he may indeed merge the reader implicit in a text with the structure or subcode of that text, but when it comes to practice, he slips back into the reassuring belief in an overriding permanent 58</page><page sequence="11">structure. And in a sense he has no choice. For one of the implicit thrusts of his theory as I have extended it, is to dissolve the distinction between the semiotic analyst and the interpretive critic. If the description of a subcode can only be accomplished in its performance and if the distanced and objective analysis of "persona" readers is only a delusion, then the task which the semiotician sets forth for himself can just as readily be accomplished by any other skilled exegete. The privilege which semiotics has arrogated itself hinges on the assumption of a less transient or more profound and universal level of structure which only a distanced approach can account for. Eco's work, in trying to account for some of the naivetes of that belief, pushes him into an impasse: he can either renounce his semiotician's privilege or renounce talking about reading in terms of a structure/event interface. In The Role of the Reader he seems unwilling to do either. The result is a book put into question by its own theory; and therein lies its weakness-and its richness.
