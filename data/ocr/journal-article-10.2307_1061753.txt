<plain_text><page sequence="1">Georgette Meredith T H E PH U RB U: THE USE AND SYMBOL- ISM OF THE TIBETAN MAGIC DAGGER INTRODUCTION Of the objects found in a collection of Tibetan artifacts, one of the most curious to the Western eye is the phurbu (phur-bu), or "magic" or "ritual dagger" mentioned in passing in most of the serious works on Tibetans and their religion. In spite of the strangeness of the instrument and the variety of forms in which it appears, the phurbu seems to have received relatively little attention in scholarly works published in European languages. In 1881, Schlagintweit published a description of a "Pourbou" in the Annales du Musee Guimet.1 Although he discusses not a dagger but a woodblock design of a phurbu printed on a paper charm, the inscriptions on the charm are of significance. In 1896, Sri Sarat Chandra Das published "A Short Description of the Phur-pa or the 'Enchanted Dagger'."2 In this very brief statement, he mentions that in Tibetan Buddhism there are two kinds of phurbus-metaphysical and ordinary. According to Das, the metaphysical phurbu strikes at the ignorance which is the cause of all the world's ills in Buddhism; however, he unfortun- 1 Emile de Schlagintweit, "Le Bouddhisme au Tibet," Annales du Musee Guimet (Lyon, 1881), pp. 166-68. 2 Sarat Chandra Das, "A Short Description of the Phur-pa or the 'Enchanted Dagger,"' Journal of the Buddhist Text Society, IV (1896), 5-7. 236</page><page sequence="2">ately does not mention his source for this information. He de- scribes the appearance and the powers of the four kinds of ordinary phurbus and tells of their use for obtaining the four kinds of worldly objects-peace, abundance, power, and fearfulness-but does not indicate by what means these are endowed with their magical efficacy, nor does he mention who uses them or how they are used. A particularly piquant feature of Das's article is that none of his descriptions fits any of the examples seen by the author. In 1900, Gruenwedel described only one style of the phurbu and called it a special form of Hayagriva.3 Tucci, in his voluminous Tibetan Painted Scrolls, devotes half a sentence to "the magic nail, kila, with which the exorcist nails to a given surface the hostile forces, after having vanquished them and rendered them harmless by virtue of the mantra (magic formula)."4 In two of the best known reference books on Tibetan religious art, the phurbu is said to be a form of the god Hayagriva.5 In 1952, Siegbert Hummel of the Museum fur Vilkerkunde in Leipzig published an article linking the phurbu to early mesolithic Near Eastern cultures.6 He describes generally several types, and men- tions that, although the deity most often represented on the handle is Hayagriva, other gods-Mahakala and Vajrakila-are also re- presented. Hummel is definite in his opinion that the phurbu is the personified presence of the deity represented. The questions that can be raised regarding the phurbu, its origin, purpose, and symbolism are not satisfactorily answered by the information supplied by the sources mentioned above. One wonders, most specifically, why Hayagriva? Why was this Tan- tric god above all others deemed most appropriate for representa- tion as a phurbu ? Why does the phurbu appear only in Tibetan religion and art ? The word itself reputedly has a counterpart in the Sanskrit kila, meaning peg or nail. It is often identified as the Sanskrit kila or vajrakila, terms which do not seem to be men- tioned in Indian Tantric literature, nor do objects which fit these terms appear in Indian Buddhist art. One would also like to be able to account for the similarities and dissimilarities in the daggers. The most distinguishing feature of 3 Albert Gruenwedel, Mythologie des Buddhismus in Tibet und der Mongolei (Leipzig, 1900), p. 165. 4 Giuseppe Tucci, Tibetan Painted Scrolls (Rome, 1949), p. 588. 5 Antoinette K.

The representations on the hilt, however, differ greatly. In many cases, the representation is animal rather than anthropo- morphic, and in some cases, the hilt is marked by neither of these. It would certainly be of interest to identify the manipulator or manipulators of the phurbu, and to determine more exactly the use they make of it. This paper is an attempt to begin to answer these questions. GENERAL DESCRIPTION A study of the phurbus in the collection of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago forms the basis of the following general description. The materials are brass, copper, wood, bone, and possibly ivory. The phurbus vary in length from about four inches to two feet. The simple forms, that is, those without multiple heads of a deity, are of wood. All phurbus can be described as having two distinctive parts. First, at the lower end, there is the blade, which in all cases has either three sides (that is, a triangular cross-section) or three ridges (which resemble a pointed trefoil in cross-section). Second, there is the hilt which usually has three components. The lowest feature, in the simpler forms of phurbu, is a decorative, though possibly significant, motif which balances the comparatively small head or knob at the top of the weapon. On the more ornate instruments, however, this element is grotesque and is usually found in conjunction with snakes slithering down one, or all three, sides of the blade. On the central portion of the hilt where the phurbu is grasped, the designs vary. Some have a plain unadorned shaft; others, a real or stylized dorje (rdo-rje, Sanskrit vajra, "thunderbolt"), a vase, a series of heads, or the anthropomorphic body of a deity. The central portion of the hilt is surmounted by the third com- ponent which is, with the exception of the extremely simple phurbus, a head or the heads of deities, in demonic or pacific form. THE BLADE As mentioned previously, the common denominator of all the phurbus is what is commonly referred to as the "triangular blade." The word "phurbu"-sometimes spelled phur-pa-also has the meaning of a large nail, or a peg, such as those to which tent ropes are tied. Neither descriptions nor illustrations of Tibetan nails or tent pegs can be said to abound in the literature, but it does seem 238</page><page sequence="4">possible that the triangular cross-section form could derive from a wooden peg used in the setting up of tents. The term "nail" probably refers to its function as given by Tucci, that of impinging hostile forces to a surface. The ridged-blade form, however, is strongly reminiscent of bronze arrowheads discovered by Roerich in undated stone graves in the Hor region of northeastern Tibet.7 Similar iron arrowheads are reported in the finds at Taxila in northwestern India.8 Mar- shall states that this style was introduced by the 8akas (Scythians) when they invaded India in the first century B.C. Roerich also reports megalithic monuments in the same area of northeastern Tibet which yielded the grave arrowheads. These monuments consist of a huge figure of an arrow laid out in stone slabs located at the eastern end of an east-west series of stone slab alignments. He states: The arrow is an important symbol in the ancient nature cult of Tibet, and is connected with the cult of the sun, and heavenly fire in the form of lightning, which it symbolizes. The present day nomads wear ancient brass arrowheads as amulets, which are said to represent the lightning that has grown cold after it has struck the ground. Incidentally, it has to be said, that the arrow is sometimes regarded as a symbol of King Kesar, whose connection with nature worship has been definitely demonstrated.9 Roerich reports a high correlation in northeastern Tibet of "stone graves," characteristic bronze arrowheads, and objects in the "animal style" with which his paper is concerned, and later states that Iranian nomadic tribes were the carriers of the animal style throughout central Asia.10 Eliade points out that throughout Siberia and central Asia the arrow has a double magico-religious significance; not only is it the symbol of shamanistic flight, but it is an extremely efficacious magical weapon by virtue of its ability to kill at a distance. It not only kills demons, but expels them as well." LOWER HILT: "GARUDA" AND "NAGAS" (OR TIBETAN "KHYUNG" AND 'LU") The snakes on the blade of the phurbu give the clue to the identifi- cation of the grotesque symbols on the hilt directly above them. 7 G.

One of these groups is made up of various kinds of lu (klu) which often appear in the guise of snakes. These can be either beneficent or malignant. It is difficult to find detailed information on what damage a malignant lu could do if angered; however, the wrath of the lu was to be avoided. The Na-khi tribe of southwestern China preserved through the 1930's what is considered to be the last remaining and most un- tainted vestige of the Bon religion. In his several works on Na-khi texts, Rock tells of the tribe's migration from eastern Tibet, probably forced by proponents of the increasingly powerful Budd- hist religion centuries ago, and their isolated existence as agricul- turalists in the Yangtse loop. The Na-khi serpent demons are known generally as the Ssu, of whom those known as Ssu-ndo bring illness to people. These Ssu-ndo are banished by priests be- fore initiating an important rite summoning the benevolent Ssu. This is done by placing a picture of a Garuda on the table next to the offering for the good Ssu. The basic figure is of a fat-bellied human-like creature with horns, who has claws for feet, wings on his back, a beak for a mouth, and who holds a snake in human-like hands. This is the form that the pre-Buddhist supernatural bird, the khyung, takes in Tibetan paintings, both Buddhist and Bon. One form of this bird is the vehicle of a special aspect of a king of the du (bdud) demons who were originally located in the upper spheres. This is the khyung of thunder, and the names of his weapons are translated as "the leash with knots causing diseases" and "like a thunderbolt." The khyung is described as a gigantic iron bird, with copper beak and copper claws, the enemy of the offenders of the Bon. In Tucci's words, this bird "represents the storm as a fiendish force which, aptly employed by the magician, turns into a defender of the community. This shows that the bird K'yun (khyung) is not only a solar symbol but also a symbol of the stormy cloud."12 Nebesky-Wojkowitz provides some information derived from Lamaist texts regarding the various garudas or khyungs. Colors vary, but horns, beak, and claws are of meteoric iron, or other metals. The beak of one consists of thunderbolts.13 The term "Garuda" is the name of a figure common to Hinduism 12 Tucci, op. cit., p. 718. 13 Rene de Nebesky-Wojkowitz, Oracles and Demons of Tibet (s'Gravenhage, 1956), pp. 256-57. 240</page><page sequence="6">V PLATE 1 Left: The thunderbolt hilt and the head of the horse identify the three ferocious heads, and the phurbu itself, as Hayagriva, or Tamdin.

He had a birdlike as well as anthropomorphic form and is considered to be the enemy of the Ndgas-the benevolent-male- volent snake demons well known in Indian mythology-and is often depicted in his birdlike form carrying a Ndga in his long beak or talons. In one legend, the amrta vase which contains the elixir of life, found in both Indian and Tibetan Buddhist art, is an important part of a significant episode between Garuda and the Ndgas.14 He is also the mount of Visnu and as such appears both in anthropomorphic form with and without wings, and as a bird. Information compiled from Tibetan works regarding the "Naga or Serpent Demi-Gods" in the Lamaist religion was published by Das in 1894. There are two classes of Ndgas: One class cares for religion and does good to human beings; the other, whose members do not care for religion, are bent on mischief and bring trouble. The good Nagas to increase the happiness of all living beings in this world cause copious rains to fall in the proper seasons. They prevent hail storms, winds and rain from coming when they are not needed... and in their devotion to Buddha guard his sacred relics.15 Regarding the mischievous Ndgas: At the time when unrighteous kings rule in this world and people become sinful... then Nagas exert their malignant influence to increase the sufferings of all living beings of the world. They cause most appal- ling sounds, like those produced by the falling of mountains, to resound, and also fearful lightning to flash, and thunder to rattle in the skies of Vedika, when people die in large numbers from the devastating effects of these natural phenomena.16 And: Again the impious Naga rajas falling out among themselves and burning with spite and rage, draw clouds to rain on earth, send hail, and cause high winds to blow, that the crops may be destroyed and the land devastated. This is their nature.17 It is likely, therefore, that the monster depicted on many phurbus from whose mouth snakes issue forth represents the Ndgas and their enemy Garwuda, or the Tibetan lu and khyung. 14 Jitendra Nath Banerjea, The Development of Hindu Iconography (Calcutta, 1956), pp. 529-31. 15 Sarat Chandra Das, "Naga or Serpent Demi-gods," Journal of the Buddhist Text Society, Part I (1894), pp. 2-5. 16 Ibid., p. 4. 17 Ibid., p. 5. 241</page><page sequence="9">Phurbu: Use and Symbolism of the Tibetan Magic Dagger CENTER HILT: THE THUNDERBOLT (SANSKRIT, "VAJRA"; TIBETAN, "DORJE") In the one-sentence descriptions of the phurbu found in most of the literature, the hilt of the dagger is said to consist of a thunder- bolt. Only a few of the instruments, however, actually have the dorje as the center portion of the hilt, although the appearance of some suggests a stylization of this motif. Many have a half or a whole dorje protruding from the head or heads of the deity repre- sented at the top. In any case, the dorje is often an important part of the more elaborate phurbus. In his article on the "Lamaist Thunderbolt," Hummel discusses its significance and its symbolization of the male principle in Tantrism.18 He also calls attention to objects of very similar form, reputed to have phallic significance, which obviously have de- structive character in Cretan, Gandharan, Turkish, and Ugritic- Chinese art. He suggests that the Indian form had developed from motifs, such as are found on Greco-Bactrian coins, into its present form by the second century B.C., and that it was Padmasambhava who introduced this form into Tibet when he began his missionary activities in the middle of the eighth century A.D. It had been noted by Tucci in western Tibet and by Roerich in northern Tibet that it is customary for those who find them to wear prehistoric stone arrowheads and other stone objects-some of meteoric origin, said to have the shape of nails, dorjes, rings, khyung, etc.-as protection against iron objects of small size which reputedly have fallen from heaven and cause danger to men and flocks, particularly in the northern plains. Some of these arrowheads are considered to be petrified lightning. Hummel points out that the arrow was a fertility symbol in the Bon reli- gion and had the same magical properties as a deterrent weapon as the thunderbolt. He theorizes that Padmasambhava, realizing this, took the vajra into Tibet, as it was a culture tool whose sym- bolism and function was already familiar to his prospective converts. UPPER HILT: HAYAGRIVA OR TAMDIN The head or heads at the top of the phurbu are said to represent Hayagriva or Tamdin (Rta-mgrin). Before Hayagriva was incor- porated into the Mahayana pantheon he had had a long and confusing history in Hinduism both as a demon and as a manifes- 18 Siegbert Hummel, "Der lamaistische Donnerkeil (Rdo-rje) und die Doppel- axt der Mittelmeerkulture," Anthropos, XLVIII (1953), 982-87. 242</page><page sequence="10">tation of Visnu. As a demon he had the shape of a horse, and as Visnu, he was described and depicted as having a horse's head. And in horseheaded form, Visnu-Hayagriva destroyed the demon Hayagriva. As Hinduism developed, the fierce (bhairava) gods achieved more recognition in Sanskrit literature, and as an awe- inspiring demon exterminator, Visnu-Hayagriva with the horse's head became more and more prominent. In his discussion of Hayagriva, van Gulik mentions that the "background of the horse-headed figure was formed by the ancient Indian horse-cult, connected with sun and fertility rites," and points out that Haya- griva's advancement was contemporaneous with the increasing popularity of the erotic Saktism, "the veneration of the female energy of Siva, and his union with her, with the resultant maith- una-rites."l9 At about A.D. 500, Visnu-Hayagriva was adopted into the Mahayana pantheon as a Vidyaraja, a king of Vidyadharas, who were in Hinduism not only a class of genii of fierce character living in the air, but also carriers (dhara) of magical knowledge or magic power (vidyd). As Mantrayana-or as it is more commonly known, Vajrayana-philosophy stressing magical incantation became more important in Buddhism, the Vidyarajas became more promi- nent. In Hinduism, Visnu-Hayagriva was well known as the "Reciter of the Vedas," the Promulgator of the Sacred Word. As Tamdin, Hayagriva found an important place in Tibetan Buddhism as one of the eight Dharmapalas, or "Defenders of the Faith," who were originally malevolent gods of the existing Bon religion hostile to Padmasambhava in his attempts to establish Buddhism in Tibet in the middle part of the eighth century A.D. By means of his Tantric formulas and his dorje, Padmasambhava conquered the chief demons and converted them to Buddhism, whereupon they were granted high positions in the ever expanding Buddhist pantheon. These deities always appear in ferocious form, not because they are still considered demons, but because their function is to frighten hostile spirits. Like most Tibetan gods, Tamdin appears in several manifesta- tions. In Tibetan art, a representation of one manfestation of a god is often more similar to a representation of a particular manifes- tation of another god than to a different aspect of the same god. Tamdin, however, is the only god ever to be represented with the 19 R.

When he is represented as a minor god in the company of others, however, the horse's head is not in evidence. He can then be identified by the danda, or short staff surmounted by a dorje or a skull, which he holds in his left hand, and by the dorje held in the right.20 Tamdin is worshipped particularly by horse traders, but is generally considered to be an extremely effective demon destroyer. The sound of his neighing at an exorcism is sufficient to put the evil spirits to flight. THREE OTHER DEITIES POSSIBLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE "PHURBUT" Hummel suggests that two other deities are embodied in the phurbu: Vajrakila and Mahakala. Vajrakila is mentioned by sev- eral authors as a Tantric demon or god, but none of the descriptive sources makes any mention of him. Tucci identifies Vajrakila as rDo-rje p'ur-bu, the "deification of the mystic nail, k.la... rDo-rje p'ur-bu is thus another instance of the deification of liturgical instruments or ritual formulas."21 This is undoubtedly the Vajra- p'urba discussed by Waddell, the tutelary demon of the Nying- mapa (Rnying-ma-pa) and the Sakyapa (Sa-skya-pa) Lamaist sects which have absorbed many of the demonic features and magical practices of Bon.22 Representations of Dorjephurbu are scarce. Tucci provides two illustrations in which the deity holds a nine-branched dorje, a five-branched dorje, a trident with skull, and a phurbu. On his back he wears "diamond wings."23 Hummel provides a photo- graph of a painting of Vajrakila in the yab-yum attitude with his female counterpart, surrounded by lesser deities, the lower portion of whose figures have the triangular shape of the phurbu blade. Vajrakila holds in two of his eight hands the khatvaiga, or ritual wand, surmounted by a dorje, a skull and two heads, topped off by a trisuila (trident).24 Few traditionally representative attributes of Mahakala as 20 Benoytosh Bhattacharyya, The Indian Buddhist Iconography (Oxford, 1924), p. 54. 21 Tucci, op. cit., p. 588. 22 L. A. Waddell, The Buddhism of Tibet (Cambridge, 1894), pp. 70, 72, 363. 23 Tucci, op. cit., p. 588. Tucci adds: "This form of rDo rje p'ur bu is also known by the name of mT'ar byed rdo rje gzon nu, or simply rDo rje gzon nu (Vajra- kumara) as to whose liturgy it is well to read, for instance, the dPal rdo rje gzon nu dykil ak'or gyi c'o ga bdud ajoms rol pa, by Taranatha (complete works, vol. ja). As to the god's essence, the Vajrayana states this god to be an aspect of Heruka (K'ro boi rgyal po)." 24 Hummel, "Der lamaistische ritualdolch...," fig. 4, p. 48. 244</page><page sequence="12">described by Getty seem to be found on any of the phurbus, with the exception of the triuila, which is his special symbol.25 In the sadhanas (Tantric texts) quoted by Bhattacharyya, the trisula is not mentioned, but in one aspect the khatvahga is held by Maha- kala. Bhattacharyya describes him as a ferocious Tantric god whose powers are valuable in the destruction of enemies.26 A major deity who is closely associated with the Garuda in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism is Vajrapani. In Lamaism, one manifestation of Vajrapani is as the residence of a number of khyung, each inhabiting a different place of the body of the god.27 In Sanskrit, Vajrapani means thunderbolt-bearer, and he is con- sidered to be the god of rain.28 Two of his special symbols are the vajra and the pdaa (lasso). His distinctive marks are the serpent and a small Garuda. Vajrapani had the task of protecting the Ndgaas from the attacks of Garudas when the Ndgas had assembled to listen to Buddha's teachings. To accomplish this, he assumed a form with Garuda head, wings, and claws. He is the god of rain by virtue of his position as protector of the Ndgas, who are believed to control the rain clouds. He is also the implacable enemy of demons and is the guardian of the amrta vase which contains the elixir of life. Vajrapani is the only god other than Hayagriva reported by Gordon to be represented in Garuda form.29 THE USES OF THE "'PHURBU" Hummel mentions that Padmasambhava consecrated the ground at the foundation ceremonies of Samye (Bsam-yas), the first lamasery in Tibet, at about A.D. 770, by stabbing a phurbu into the earth. He further states that Bon priests today do the same thing at ground-consecration ceremonies to deter earth spirits.30 Waddell reports that "to consecrate the ground and procure super- natural wonders" Padmasambhava made a mandala (circular de- piction of the universe) of rDo rje P'ur-pa with colored stone dust. He also called upon the five regional Garuda birds to help, and transformed himself into a "great garuda holding a snake in his clutches and beak."31 Waddell also lists the phurbu as one of the weapons used by a common sorcerer, a Nag-pa (Ngag-pa), or 25 Alice Getty, op. cit., pp. 143-44. 26 Bhattacharyya, op. cit., p. 21. 27 Nebesky-Wojkowitz, op. cit., pp. 256-57. 28 Getty, op. cit., pp. 48-50. 29 Gordon, op. cit., p. 95. 30 Hummel, "Der lamaistische Ritualdolch...." 31 Waddell, op. cit., p. 266. 3-H.O.R. 245</page><page sequence="13">Phurbu: Use and Symbolism of the Tibetan Magic Dagger "Expert in Incantations," in battling the demons of the sky re- sponsible for non-fatal diseases.32 He refers as well to the phurbu of Ser-ra monastery which is reputed to have flown in from India and is displayed to the Dalai Lama and the public at an annual celebration, but otherwise kept hidden, wrapped in cloth, so that it will not fly away. Waddel translates Ser-ra as meaning "The Merciful Hail."33 Schlagintweit says that the phurbu, when pointed in the direc- tion of demons and accompanied by the repetition of a magical formula, will chase demons away or destroy them. He describes a block print of a phurbu much sought after as a charm against disease or bad luck, particularly if the dhdranis, or formulas, printed thereon are composed by the Dalai Lama or the Panchen Lama. The charm he describes represents and is dedicated to Tamdin. The dhdranis are addressed to the demons of the earth, the air, and the eight quarters.34 In the extremely valuable work of Nebesky-Wojkowitz on the cult and iconography of Tibetan protective deities, one can find many provocative references to the phurbu. Relying on the sdd- hanas, or texts describing the appearance of and the proper ritual toward these deities, he mentions phurbus made of iron, copper, gold, turquoise, conch shell, and sandalwood carried by certain of the deities, greater and lesser, their attendants, a magician com- panion of a god, a ridge deity, and retinues of goddesses. Without exception, those who carry the phurbu are those who have been incorporated into Lamaism directly from the Bon religion. This explains why Hayagriva, or Tamdin, the god imported from India, does not have the phurbu as an attribute, that is, he never carries it in any of his manifestations, in spite of the fact that the phurbu is most often considered to be a manifestation of this deity. It is interesting that of the thirty-eight deities of whatever standing in the hierarchy who carry the phurbu as an attribute, twenty-seven are female. For example, Paldan Lhamo (Dpal-ldan Lha-mo) has many females and just a few males in attendance on her. Six of the females carry the phurbu; none of the males do. Of all her attendants, only these same six females wear cloaks of a thousand black snakes and loin cloths made of a thousand khyung wings.35 32 Ibid., p. 483. 33 Ibid., p. 269. 34 Schlagintweit, op. cit., p. 168. 35 Nebesky-Wojkowitz, op. cit., p. 18. 246</page><page sequence="14">The leading god and goddess of the Sinpo (Srin-po) demons as described by Nebesky-Wojkowitz are of interest. The king is dressed in a cloak of lightning and holds corns of hail in his hand; his wife holds a phurbu. Another Bon god has nine heads; lightning issues from his eyes, thunder from his ears, hail from his tongue. The first of his several pairs of hands hold a phurbu.36 Nebesky-Wojkowitz mentions that phurbus made from sandal- wood and red copper are offered to two of the attendants of Begtse (Beg-tse) when the services of that god are required in the practice of black magic.37 He also gives the common methods by which Tibetan magicians cause harm and destruction consisting of ill- ness, insanity, lameness, and damage to cattle and to stores. For each catastrophe, in addition to other varying magical rites, a phurbu of a specific material must be wielded, accompanied by the inevitable one hundred thousand repetitions of the appropriate formula.38 The phurbu is also listed as one of the five instruments of the Tibetan weathermakers in preventing the fall of hail on the area they are charged with protecting.39 However, the Bon priest who specializes in destructive magic brandishes a phurbu in conjuring up hailstorms in order to destroy the crops of his enemies. In order to harm an enemy and his property by lightning, a weather- maker joins a phurbu with a dorje and repairs to the dwelling place of a black lu, where he performs the proper magic accompanied by a hundred thousand obeisances.40 In reviewing the evidence presented above based on specific references to the phurbu, it appears that the instrument symbol- izes an amalgam of very similar concepts found both in India and Tibet at the time of the introduction of Buddhism there. It is likely that the phurbu itself is the result of the superimposition of a Buddhist magical implement on an implement already in use in Tibet which had much the same power-that of allaying the threat of evil with the threat of the potential destruction of the demons responsible for it. Although the instrument has much the same power as the arrow traditionally has, it nevertheless is not called an arrow. There is an arrow that is part of the magical apparatus of the priesthood of Bon and Lamaism, but it is referred 36 Ibid., p. 317. 37 Ibid., p. 491. 38 Ibid., p. 486. 39 Ibid., p. 471. 40 Ibid., p. 476. 247</page><page sequence="15">Phurbu: Use and Symbolism of the Tibetan Magic Dagger to in the literature as a "divining arrow" and is always bedecked with ribbons of various colors. Its use seems to be ceremonial and propitiatory, rather than threatening. Thus one can postulate that the original instrument for threatening and impaling demons was similar in shape to the probably three-sided tent peg, but with the introduction of the more spectacular triple-ridged arrow- head, this latter form was adopted in the manufacture of some of the implements. We have seen that the phurbu of one kind or another is manipu- lated by lamas, monks, sorcerers, Bon priests, and deities against demons, most specifically of the earth and sky, or to produce or prevent illness or bad luck, to prevent hail, to bring on hail, and to consecrate ground. In trying to determine if the phurbu is used against a specific class of demons associated with either rain or illness or both, one is tempted to consider that it is probably directed against the Ndgas or lu, as the Garuda devouring the snakes on the blade of the phurbu seems to give a broad hint that the point is directed against evil lu. However, the limited evidence available from other pertinent sources seems to suggest that this is not so. NA-KHI EVIDENCE AND CONCLUSIONS In viewing the paintings of the Na-khi, it is immediately noted that although Shenrab (Gshen-rabs), the reputed founder of the Bon faith, sits on a lotus throne in a Gautama-like pose and holds a phurbu-the only non-ferocious form to hold this weapon-the Na-khi Shi-lo, the founder of the supposedly untainted form of Bon, also sits Buddha-like, but holds no weapon. In Na-khi art, the phurbu bearer is Ler-gyu-gkyi-tyn who deters Dter demons- headless ghosts who cause violent deaths.41 A nice legend is translated by Rock concerning the Garud.a, Shi-lo, and the Ssu. These were all born at the same time and had divided the earth among themselves. People (i.e., cultivators) arrived and sullied the land and the wild life. In retaliation, one greedy Ssu king did not permit the intruders to work the land nor to herd sheep. Garuda was sent for and was given copper and iron claws by Shi-lo so that he could catch and punish the impetuous Ssu king. Shi-lo mediated the feud between the farmers and the Ssu. The latter were to be propitiated by food offerings and ritual, 41 Joseph F. Rock, The Na-khi Naga Cult and Related Ceremonies (Rome, 1952), p. 133, n. 117. 248</page><page sequence="16">jewels, and healing medicines. The many other fights between the Ssu and the humans occurring over desecrated natural resources were always mediated, and the Ssu were provided with temples and offerings of domestic animals and processed food such as loaves of pounded rice and loaves of butter. Another time, the Ssu were again offended by the burning of their relatives by field fires and their destruction by floods. In retaliation, nine snake demons came to make a certain innocent human family ill. Other demons arrived to liberate the family, but ended up causing the snakes to become ill. Shi-lo descended from heaven and, with a golden bow and arrow, suppressed all the demons, prepared some medicine, and cured the snakes and the family. The Ssu demons were sent away. To summarize, in the Na-khi literature arrows are used by gods and priests against all the demons except the Ssu. In fact, Ssu use arrows themselves to chase other demons. The Garuda is the sole weapon used against the Ssu-ndo who produce illness; they are only driven out-never destroyed. The extremely close association of the Ndgas in Indian litera- ture with those in Tibetan Buddhist texts as reported by Das would suggest that, if the priestly manipulator was not threatening the lu directly with the phurbu, he was somehow utilizing the services of the lu to control rain and hail for the good of society, while the sorcerer, perhaps in league with lu demons, sent a rain of hail on his enemy. Garuda is possibly an important adjunct to this control as he is the only recorded weapon against the Ssu-ndo and the Ndgas. Any association of the Ssu with rainfall is not apparent from the Na-khi literature examined, where their chief function seems to be to defend to the degree possible their original title to the earth and, in retaliation for human depredations, to bring about illness in the wrongdoers. This may have been the original function of the lu, but Buddhism assigned them the additional task of controlling the weather, which Tucci suggests may have been the province of the khyung. Rock reports that the Na-khi use the Tibetan phurbu to kill or drive out demons during ceremonial dances only, and that dto- mbas used the thunderbolt only rarely. The arrow that appears in their manuscripts is depicted as a hafted flat triangular point and is obviously different from any type of phurbu. There the phurbu is a demon-killer only, and the arrow connected with the Ssu and illness is distinctly an arrow. This suggests that the phurbu was originally associated with the Garudca and weather-making, and 249</page><page sequence="17">Phurbu: Use and Symbolism of the Tibetan Magic Dagger that any association with lu was a later development, if, of course, such an association exists at all. The contemporaneousness of the appearance of the cultivators with sheep who encroached on the land formerly held by deities, and the acquisition by the Garuda for seemingly the first time of copper and iron claws in the Na-khi legend, is perhaps of signifi- cance in the development of the Bon religion and the history of its adherents. The story strongly suggests that agriculturalists made gradual inroads on the territories of nomadic populations with yak herds who had previously developed a modus vivendi with the Ssu and khyung. It seems that the newcomers introduced metal in the form of weapons that, by virtue of their superiority, acquired a magical aspect. These same magical materials were then given to the khyung so that he could control the Ssu more readily and enable the newcomers to come to terms with them. There is a definite suggestion here of religious as well as political or economic strife and the eventual adaptation by the Ssu followers to the more efficient ways of the immigrants and an assimilation of religious beliefs. It was perhaps at this time that the lu acquired their beneficent and destructive powers over the occurrence of rain and hail. The significant aspect of this belief is the preoccupa- tion with the protection of the crops by the magician, which is also the preoccupation of the agriculturalist. Or perhaps this concept, so prevalent in India, accompanied Padmasambhava. EVIDENCE AND CONCLUSIONS FROM TIBETAN BON ART The several Bon deities associated with the phurbu recruited by Padmasambhava and his followers prove the existence and the magical use of the phurbu before the advent of Buddhism in Tibet. That only some of the converts carry the phurbu might then demonstrate that it was the instrument of only one class of sham- ans or priests who were associated with a specific cult or in charge of certain demons. Tucci has discussed the four classes of priests which did exist in Bon, but here again the phurbu has been given but scant recognition, and not in connection with any of these priests.42 The preponderance of feminine bearers of the phurbu in the paintings, plus the fact that there are women magicians in Tibet in modern times who propitiate the lu at least,43 may mean that this was originally the instrument of female magicians who 42 Tucci, op. cit., p. 715. 43 Sarat Chandra Das, "Contributions on the Religion, History, &amp;c. of Tibet," Jour'nal of the Asian Society of Bengal, L, pt. 1 (1881), p. 196. 250</page><page sequence="18">have been ignored due to lack of documented evidence, perhaps as a result of low social position, or the transfer of their duties to men as the result of the introduction of Buddhism. Although the phurbu depicted in Tibetan Buddhist paintings sometimes does not have the head or heads of deities, whether or not they represent Tamdin, none of the phurbus depicted in Bon art have heads depicting either deities or horses. Rather, there is a series of geometric shapes-squares, diamonds, faceted cubes, circles, half-circles-that form the handle. The blades are depicted both with ridges and with triangular cross-section. A phurbu of this type is the main attribute of Shenrab, the founder of the Bon faith. As a handle would not only make the nail or arrowhead easier to manipulate as well as serve to differentiate it from its utilitarian relative, these geometric forms quite possibly were in use on the instrument at the time of the arrival of Padmasam- bhava, and were eventually supplanted by the dorje, which was his most effective weapon in subduing demons. The term "vajra- kila" was doubtlessly translated literally from the Tibetan dorje- phurbu by the lamas who wrote the texts in Sanskrit previous to the development of the Tibetan literary language and script in the ninth century. In Buddhism, the transformed weapon of the Bon religion acquired a status of its own, and if it was not in the Tibetan psychology to attribute divinity to a magical tool or symbol, this concept existed in India where cult objects were often considered deities and even endowed with a specific sex as well as a deified personality. EVIDENCE AND CONCLUSIONS FROM TIBETAN MYTHOLOGY The most important remaining question is, how did the phurbu become associated with Hayagriva or Tamdin? The evidence available once again suggests that it was the result of assimilation of similar magical attributes. Van Gulik points out how easily Hayagriva was adopted into the horse cults extant in Tibet, Mongolia, and Japan, maintaining his individuality while incor- porating the local gods in his own person. He gives three magical conceptions with which Hayagriva is associated, and these throw light on his eventual association with the phurbu. In the first place, the function as fecundity-symbol, which is credited to the horse on account of phallic considerations.... Secondly the neighing, the magical horse-voice. On the one hand, this voice is melodious and well-omened; it is the sweet sound of Vishnu-Hayagriva promul- gating the Sacred Word. On the other hand, it is the terrible sound that 251</page><page sequence="19">Phurbu: Use and Symbolism of the Tibetan Magic Dagger scares away devils: the Destroyer and Devourer, the bhairava Haya- griva. In the third place, its celerity: the horse is the swift charger which carries his rider over the immeasurable plains. To this category belongs the idea of the divine, winged steed. In the "chest-nuts" or "scars" on the legs of the horse, one imagined to recognize the places where formerly the wings had been attached.44 It is relevant at this point to take note of pre-Buddhist Tibetan mythology. The epic of Gesar (or Kesar), King of Ling (Gling), has been an important part of the folklore of the area from the Himalayas to Lake Baikal, and from Pamir to Lake Kokonor since long before the arrival of Padmasambhava. Stein has shown the value of the epic in understanding the history of Tibet, some of its social system, and much of the Bon religion when Buddhistic accretions to the legend have been removed. The legend is a rich one and has many versions. The consistent theme, however, is that Gesar's life was dedicated to the submission of the various demon rulers of areas peripheral to the inhabited world in the guise of kings of the regions bordering Ling in eastern Tibet. He accom- plished his mission with the aid of his faithful warriors, his large magic arrows which never missed their mark, however far the target, and his celestial horse who transported Gesar through the air, accomplishing vast distances in very little time. Stein presents textual evidence that Gesar's horse has come to equal the incarnation of Hayagriva.45 Throughout his very scholarly and thorough work on Gesar and attendant symbolism, however, Stein mentions the phurbu only once, and this in a foot- note: "the 'support' par excellence of rTa-mgrin is the phur-bu, magic dagger surmounted with the head of a horse."46 It thus seems that there was no connection between the phurbu per se and Gesar, and that a relationship with the flying-horse concept took place after the introduction of Hayagriva. As the most notable magical tools at Gesar's disposal were his flying horse and his magic arrows, it was on this combination of concepts that Hayagriva imposed himself to become Tamdin. The quickest route that Tamdin could possibly take to the phurbu would be by virtue of the fertility and phallic implications that the arrow, the dorje, and the horse are reputed to have in common. Once these concepts are combined in the phurbu, we have the arrow of fertility, the peg of demon control, the arrow of demon control, and the demon-subduing arrows of Gesar portrayed in 44 van Gulik, op. cit., pp. 95-96. 45 Rolf Stein, L'Epopee Tibetaine (Paris, 1956), pp. 414, 511. 46 Ibid., p. 565. 252</page><page sequence="20">one symbolic element. The aerial aspects of the horse, the Garuda and khyung, and the flight of magic arrows also fortify each other nicely. The phurbu itself has a tendency to fly away if not kept under cover. The Indian concept of the Garuda being the mount of Visnu makes him also the mount of Hayagriva; therefore, Garud.a becomes the mount of Tamdin. Put another way, Garuda replaced Gesar's horse as the mount of Hayagriva, who was a horse himself, when Hayagriva became Tamdin. This once again reinforces the argument that originally the phurbu was closely associated with the khyung; but this association has been for- gotten, and the phurbu, which perhaps was considered to be a manifestation of the khyung, has replaced Garuda as Tamdin's mount. It must not be overlooked that the one constant concomitant of the manipulation of a phurbu, in no matter what form, is the spoken or written formula. This, of course, is a universally indis- pensable part of magic. But an intriguing thing about the phurbu is that, when Tamdin is manifested in this form, he needs no magician. He himself can produce the magical sounds that terrify and drive away demons. Although Hoffmann has declared that in his opinion the khyung is of Tibetan origin,47 and although the lu are generally considered indigenous to Tibet, upon which the mythology of the Garud.a and Ndgas has been grafted, the similarities in their appearance, mani- festations, and function-almost to the point of their being identi- cal-seem to indicate a common origin. In other words, from the evidence available in Western languages, four of the main attri- butes of a phurbu-the horse, Garuda, Ndgas, thunderbolt- strongly suggest that they each originally derived from a common source and found its way into Tibet and India separately, but with the introduction of Buddhism, these concepts and symbols were reintroduced into Tibet, where the forms that had developed independently but in parallel ways were superimposed one on the other, both conceptually and symbolically. An investigation of the origins, spread, and development of the Garuda legends, Naga mythology, the thunderbolt concept, the bronze and iron-ridged arrowheads, the concept of the magic nail, and the horse in central Asian and Indian mythology should throw much light on, if not the origins of the Tibetans, at least the migrations and cultural interchanges in that reputedly inaccessible land. 47 Helmut Hoffmann, Quellen zur Geschichte der tibetischen Bon Religion (Wiesbaden, 1950), p. 145. 253</page></plain_text>
