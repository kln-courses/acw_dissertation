Charles Baudelaire, Les Paradis artificiels THIS ALARMING REVERSAL experienced by the hashish smoker is clearly portrayed as the hyperbolic expression, the comble, of the aspiration harboured by those "poètes panthé istiques" who seek to merge totally with external nature: "Vous voici arbre mugissant au vent et racontant à la nature des mélodies végétales." Baudelaire's irony reflects his own resistance to nature poetry, allied to the reluctance to forfeit the controlling lucidity of reflexive conscious ness. Yet the poet of Le Spleen de Paris was also capable, in discussing his friend Banville, of high praise for the lyric poet, that "homme hyper bolique" who, by dint of daring to be "absolument lyrique," "opère fatalement un retour vers l'Eden perdu."1 Since the mid-nineteenth cen tury, French poets have oscillated between hyper-critical astringency and aspirations in which we can recognise the lyric priorities identified by Baudelaire. In the context of a poetry which, in recent decades, has fre quently returned to the evidence of the given world, Jacques Réda has certainly accentuated the lyric pole. Indeed, his work is striking for the frequency with which he alludes to experiences of osmosis between mind and environment, moments of self-dissociation and reversal which, in their disorientating extremity, sometimes resemble those of the Baude lairean hashish-smoker. Consider, for example, the following passages: Je flottais avec ma fumée et n'en sortais que comme une fine antenne promenée par la ville elle-même, une lanterne qu'elle portait en rêve au travers de sa propre masse pour en sonder l'énigme et l'épaisseur... (La Tourne, p. 153) Je ne suis plus moi-même à présent qu'un souvenir qui divague, se perdant de rue en rue jusqu'à l'éblouissement des ponts, parmi ces passants que le soleil d'hiver imagine. (Les Ruines de Paris, p. 44) Et moi sur le talus de cette route dont je ne suis qu'un des accidents, la conscience de plus en plus claire de soi qu'elle prend avec chaque tour de roue, pour s'enhardir, et se dérouler à mon chapeau comme une longue fumée bleue? (L'Herbe des talus, p. 196) VOL. XXXII, No. 2 77</page><page sequence="2">L'Esprit Créateur Mais quels desseins le promeneur lui-même a-t-il nourris? [...] A son tour devenu [...] Un lieu de passage mental où la ville se perd, Se retrouve, se plaît peut-être à sa métamorphose En pages où parfois des vers circulent dans la prose... (Châteaux des courants d'air, back cover) Je filtre, retiens de plus en plus mal, déjà souffle parmi les souffles, étincelle dans la lumière, tunnel dans la nuit. De nouveau le processus de dissolution s'est mis en marche. Il faut se préparer à disparaître encore un coup. (Le Sens de la marche, p. 48) The dissolution of the self, its wraith-like evaporation into the ambient air, is common to all these passages whose emblem might be the phrase "ne plus que" which signals the fundamental reversal through which poetic consciousness becomes a satellite of the phenomena it witnesses, rather than the reverse. In the first quotation Réda does not convey an annexation of the city by poetic fureur, nor an ecstatic union with its essence. Rather, by resorting to what may seem at first like a naive anthropomorphism, he conveys a particular kind of participation whereby the poet's mind becomes an extension of the city's reality, a "lieu de passage mental" (quotation 4) within which that reality is made apparent. In the poetic act, sleights of syntax, diction and figure en gender a double displacement: of the city, transmuted into lines, colours, and volumes which precipitate desire; of the poet, whose own mental space is evacuated of all personal property in order to make way for its "guests." Consenting to disappear (quotation 5), to cede his own memo ries to the anonymous "souvenir" of his surroundings (quotation 2), the poet becomes a conduit or tunnel through which the world may pass. In selecting passages from works published over a period of some fif teen years, my aim was partly to indicate the continuity of Réda's con cerns. Now, however, I wish to identify a change of emphasis which has come about progressively in the remarkable series of five books, written largely in prose but (increasingly) with many interpolations in verse, inaugurated by Les Ruines de Paris in 1977.2 The prose poems which make up that volume (and their precursor, the prose text which opens La Tourne3) reflect the decisive step of casting the poet as an inveterate promeneur and of making poetry and travel indissoluble. In Les Ruines de Paris each highly charged and densely metaphorical poem presents itself, in its radical discontinuity, as the distillation of a more or less pro ductive excursion into the "nébuleuse parisienne," or further afield. Beginning usually in media res, and with limited anecdotal contextualiza 78 Summer 1992</page><page sequence="3">Sheringham tion, the poems are marked by a restless, urgent pizzicato rhythm explic itly modelled on the walking bass ("basse ambulante") and other features of the jazzman's artistry of which Réda has written with such sympathetic discernment. By contrast, later collections such as Recom mandations aux promeneurs and Le Sens de la marche have a quite dif ferent atmosphere, and a far more variegated climate. The pieces tend to be longer, more discursive, and more anecdotal. Rather than eliminating the framework of autobiographical experience within which writing and travelling merge, Réda foregrounds it, breaking with his earlier tendency to eschew the récit.4 The change of emphasis whch I have briefly evoked is perhaps perceptible in the excerpts already given, but to make it more patent I shall quote again: Mais la ville montrait son âme entièrement désoeuvrée, comme une fille encore qui d'elle même ne décidera pas, qui tourne, a l'air de réfléchir, attend sans que l'on puisse inter préter son regard [...). Et ses yeux s'ouvraient donc à l'extrémité de chaque avenue, tantôt gris, tantôt bleus, toujours dans la douceur de ce qui ne se fixe pas mais qui rêve, me rêvant aussi moi l'indécis entre oubli et peut-être, passant. (Les Ruines de Paris, p. 142) Là règne souverainement le bleu immatériel de l'hiver, qui se fonce et s'épaissit de façon plus sensuelle à mesure qu'avance l'après-midi. Cette souveraineté tolère la circulation de gros nuages et semble même s'en réjouir. Jusqu'à un enthousiasme qui me dilate comme une outre mystique, faute de pouvoir s'extérioriser, j'admire la géométrie complexe mais dépouillée qu'inscrivent, dans cet espace, des compositions bien rythmées de fils, caténaires, poteaux [...]. Emouvante, instructive rencontre de la volonté logique et transi toire humaine, et de ces passagères vapeurs sur un fond sans fond permanent. (Le Sens de la marche, p. 210) The context of the two passages is similar: a portion of city glimpsed from a train pulling out of Paris; a section of sky observed during a wait at a suburban station. But the character of these moments is markedly different. In the first, the métaphore filée of city as bashful girl seems to enact the spectator's desire to hold on to an inherently evanescent experi ence. The series of predicates assigned to the girl/city exactly match the vicissitudes of that desire, and we hardly need to wait for the explicit osmotic reversal ("me rêvait aussi moi l'indécis") to feel that in this glimpse (and by virtue, indeed, of its elusiveness) the city figures a desired mode of being, answers a need for an intensely imagined onto logical plenitude. The motif of indecision or hesitation which links city/ girl to poet/observer is an indication that the experience is viewed in terms of a potential transformation of existence: to be a "passant," VOL. XXXII, No. 2 79</page><page sequence="4">L'Esprit Créateur here, is to be "in between," caught in the space which divides the real from the figurai, the eminently forgettable ("l'oubli") and the merely virtual ("peut-être"); it is to be in the grip of that "attraction du centre" about which Réda had written so eloquently in La Tourne. The language here, in its elliptical, self-absorbed, hypnotic rapidity, as it cascades through branching clauses, seeks to cling to a perception it knows it has already lost. In the second passage the poet/observer allows himself to be suffused by what has galvanized his attention (a patch of sky traversed by clouds and criss-crossed by wires) precisely to the degree that he refrains from any overt attempt to possess it. Rather than a proliferating series of intuitive jabs or riffs, his discourse attunes itself to the percepts, adopting a calm, meditative tempo befitting the experience of dilation rather than concentration which occurs here. Accepting the limits of the experience, as something immanent rather than transcendent, the poet curbs his figurai zeal as he develops metaphorical links between the remote blue sky, the transitory clouds, and the impermanent products of human industry. The change of emphasis I have pinpointed should not be exaggerated or seen exclusively in terms of progress or polarisation. One of the most attractive features of Réda's work is that it is a continuum, a series of improvisations and explorations in which he tries out different ap proaches and, often playfully, adopts different modes: autobiography in L'Herbe des talus, the guide-book in Châteaux des courants d'air, the "how-to" manual in Recommandations aux promeneurs. Moreover, the evolution of Réda's writing is partly the outcome of a progressive accept ance of open-endedness, of the ever-increasing weight he has placed on the conviction that "le passage" is the essential feature of mortal exis tence. The figure of the promeneur which has progressively emerged in Réda (and which, since with it comes his distinctive voice as a poet, will perhaps be his most enduring creation) is essential in this regard. Solitary (sometimes almost curmudgeonly) and socially unclassifiable, the promeneur aspires to that specific form of anonymity which is the sign of the poet's availability to experience. Self-contained (he carries all essen tials with him, from a thermos to a toy soldier), he travels light, by train or Solex, and prefers, even relishes, putting up with the discomforts of cheap, unfashionable hotels to accepting the hospitality of friends. With out a watch, he has no fixed timetable but sets himself non-utilitarian targets determined only by whim. What matters is not arriving at a puta tive destination but realising as profoundly as possible, on the way, how 80 Summer 1992</page><page sequence="5">Sheringham very little it matters whether he arrives or not. I propose now to focus on Le Sens de la marche, and in particular on two important aspects: journeys in the footsteps of other writers and Réda's presentation of his motives. Like its immediate predecessors, Le Sens de la marche is a mixture of prose and verse, but apart from the poems which open and close the volume, the verse is almost entirely incorporated within the prose pieces. Réda's digressive prose is now much closer to the essay (he is an admirer of Montaigne) than to the poème en prose, and each piece is the record of a journey. Five of the nine main essays concern journeys made under the aegis of writers Réda admires: La Fontaine, Proust, Wordsworth, Renard, and Follain, and in each case he travels with an appropriate stock of reading matter. To retrace the steps of another is to allow our experiences to be channeled by those of our precursor. Yet, equally, the attempt to explore, in real space, what is also someone else's mental and emotional construct is to change the footing of one's journey, to displace it on to another level, to make it double.5 As Réda will frequently suggest, to travel with the other in mind is to turn the environs into a shadowland, and to become shadowy oneself. If, moreover, the effect is to discipline our attention, as we seek to align it with what has gone before, this may foster rather than inhibit the mobility of contemplative thought. We ought therefore, per haps, to view Réda's decision to travel "with" La Fontaine and the others as an act of homage which provides—literally—a "pre-text" rather than a purpose for his journey. And this strategy should therefore be associated with other kinds of "contrainte" Réda sets for himself in Le Sens de la marche, such as deciding to look for the source of the river Vioménil, to cover six départements in four days, or to traverse (the word traversée is recurrent) a region such as the Brie or the Meuse. There is nothing systematic or formalistic here, but this admirer of Queneau clearly sees that a constraint freely adopted can be inherently liberating; and there is some sense in linking Réda's journeys with the strategies of such so-called landscape artists as Richard Long whose "works" com memorate predetermined, yet at the same time aleatory, trajectories in space and time. For Réda, one of the main incitements to travel, to remain on the move, is to escape the limits of a circumscribed identity and an inhibiting past, to explore the multiplicity of potential ways of being. The letters La Fontaine sent to his spouse as he made the longest journey of his life (from Paris to Limoges) exude, in their language, a mode of being which VOL. XXXII, No. 2 81</page><page sequence="6">L'Esprit Créateur Réda seeks to revivify as he follows his poet-ancestor along part of the same route, addressing him a series of chatty missives which report his observations. Wilfully anachronistic and artificial, larded both with quotations from La Fontaine and with poems of his own, which some times verge on pastiches of La Fontaines's style, Réda's epistolary journey takes on the character of a dialogical space, a mingling of voices which annuls time and affirms the fundamental universality of a poetic percep tion of the world. Likewise, the counterpoint between quotations from the poet Jean Follain's memoir of childhood, Canisy, and the poems Réda is sparked to write as he tours the village of Canisy, book in hand, takes on an antiphonal character, transcending the drab banality of the Normandy village, this "enclave désertée de la mémoire" (Le Sens de la marche, p. 176), and affirming the perennial power and freshness of poetic vision and poetic language. By not naming Follain until midway through one of the poems written in his wake, Réda underlines the anonymity of the space into which he seeks provisional access: not the Canisy of Follain's real boyhood (Réda is not nostalgic, even if Follain was), but the space which conjoins the Canisy poetically recreated in Follain's memoir and the Canisy transformed by Réda's particular way of "traversing" it. Ultimately this space exists only on paper: it cannot be "held" for long in the head of its witness, but only preserved in the words through which he bodies it forth: "dans ma tête encore un moment se rejoignent,/Reflets se reflétant le long d'un invisible pli,/Des mots qui sont mémoire et les choses que prend l'oubli" (185). Réda's account of a tour in the Lake District of Wordsworth, Cole ridge and Southey is the most extensive and ambitious of his "journey ings-with." In a preamble, punningly entitled "En manière de prélude," he lists the features of Wordsworth's writing which appeal to him and which he has tried to emulate in his own work (these include "la note de haute et grave sentimentalité lyrique qui, jusque dans les poèmes les plus délicats, fait résonner sans le moindre effet une profondeur méta physique" [Le Sens de la marche, p. 63]), and explains his resolve to record the journey stage by stage in a series of regular sonnets (a decision dictated partly by the size of notebook he had with him). "L'emploi du vers" has, he observes, become second nature to him6; here, however, the use of verse is more systematic and thoroughgoing. First of all, pro portionally, the thirty sonnets occupy as much space as the prose text which links them together. Secondly, the italicised prose and the poems printed in roman type constantly subvert any stable dichotomy between 82 Summer 1992</page><page sequence="7">Sheringham the poetic and the prosaic. They achieve this by constituting a seamless continuum (the poems—though each bears a title—often continue a "sentence" begun in prose) and by constantly interchanging the "prosaic" tasks of narrative and commentary. In its "degré zéro" the poetry is very prosaic indeed: Cependant, Une Précision: Je n'ai pas dit le nom de ce lac: Ullswater, Qui n'est pas le plus grand. Pour la superficie, Windermere à coup sûr a la suprématie... (75) But Réda has no interest in reserving poetry for supposedly "higher" things: let it do its share of the spadework! And so poems record the quest for a cork-screw, the flight from Japanese tourists at Dove Cot tage, double-decker buses, aching feet, Fish and Chips. What subsists, and indeed emerges enhanced, in the constant transit between poetry and prose, is the ceaseless shift from one level of attention and feeling to another. However mobile, and ultimately irrelevant, the borderline be tween poem and prose may be, the fact of switching to and fro enacts, and indeed actively fosters, the displacement which is the hallmark of the poetic. Réda frequently alludes to the dissolution of identity brought about by his mode of travel. Not a native, but no stranger, given his close acquaintance with the works of Wordsworth and his circle; a traveller, but not a tourist; in the midst of others, but acutely conscious of his total solitude, he lives "l'aventure/De n'être personne entre les restaurants,/ Le village, l'église et sa cloche champêtre" (90). Travelling thus may bring "une certaine dépersonnalisation, comme si l'on se transformait en un libre espace dont celui qu'on explore devient à son tour le promeneur" (69). As a vacant space in which the beauties of the landscape (and especially the mountains), memories of the Lake poets, the events of the day, can resonate and merge, Réda progressively finds himself haunted by the shade of another displaced person who lived in the shadow of poetry, namely Dorothy Wordsworth, as the poem "Coleridge, William, et Dorothy" shows: L'un semblable aux tourments de ce grand paysage, L'autre à la profondeur de son calme soumis: Que plus rien désormais ne les divise, amis, Vol. XXXII, No. 2 83</page><page sequence="8">L'Esprit Créateur Presque jumeaux par la matrice du langage Où, relisant leurs vers, à mon tour je m'engage Et soupèse les miens comme dans un tamis Trop fin. Et je me sens un indigent, hormis Pour celle dont on sait à peine le visage Mais dont je crois que la bonté m'accompagnait, Sa main furtive quelquefois sur mon poignet, Muette et, brusquement distante mais fidèle, M'entraînant de nouveau vers un autre horizon, Sans que cesse jamais de battre, à cause d'elle, Le cœur même des mots au cœur de la maison. (85) With its moving cadences this fine poem both celebrates the sense of affinity with Dorothy, which develops in the course of Réda's solitary journey, and conveys the wider network of family relationships into which, by proxy of the fusion of travel and language, he finds himself enmeshed. The identification with Dorothy is threefold. In its sometimes clumsy directness her famous Journal, which Réda reads along with her brother's guide to the Lake District, is perceived as a model of attentive ness, revealing "son âme non pas changeante mais sensible jusqu'au ver tige aux mouvements de la vie et aux métamorphoses de sa splendeur" (66). Then, her human drama—displaced in the affections, and the household, of her brother by their cousin Mary Hutchinson; unlucky in her love for Coleridge who preferred Mary's cousin Sarah—not only touches Réda but makes Dorothy less remote than the fiery Coleridge and the preternaturally calm Wordsworth; moreover, her position as a third party also resembles his own. Lastly, Dorothy's sisterliness makes her the embodiment of an unthreatening, maternal femininity and of a selfless, non-possessive love. All these factors tend to ally Dorothy with poetry itself, a "matrice" in which language truly lives, by dint of a vigi lance akin to that of "celle qui fut son autre âme: la sœur/Exquise dont l'intelligence et la douceur/Habitent chaque mot devenu poésie" (86). If Réda's poems are accorded any kind of priority, it is only in the strict sense that, composed instantaneously, "sur le motif," they predate the retrospective prose which links them. One of the effects of this déca lage is to bring into view questions which, while never expressly formu lated or answered, seem constantly latent: Why poetry? Why travel? What is a poet? Réda's answer to these questions seems to reside in the demonstration that a poet is someone who leads a double life, a secret agent who is involved, by virtue of what poetry exacts but also of what it promises, in a constant process of dédoublement and self-distancing. 84 Summer 1992</page><page sequence="9">Sheringham Rather than being inspired, a magus with vatic powers, a possédé, the poet is constantly displaced by his double, that anonymous protagonist who participates in the wider rhythms of the world and their repercus sions in language. The two sonnets (written at Oxenholme station) which close "Le District des lacs" link what poetry is and does to questions of memory and language. Taking leave of the "ombres" he has evoked, Réda wonders if his journey has been more than a mingling of absences: that of the shades whose abiding presence has only been "inferred" from features of the landscape and his own absence, given that he has been "Moins qu'une ombre/Parmi d'autres" and will have left no trace on the landscape he has traversed. Yet if, at one level, nothing has taken place, and time has already obliterated Réda's "passage fortuit," this death heralds the perpetuation of his experience—in the "clement" environment of memory. While the details of his trip are already fading, the "ombres," including his own, seem to become more real: "Donc le départ est comme un retour qui commence,/L'adieu comme un salut du temps à la clémence/De la mémoire" (105). And the Wordsworthian valediction which follows—"vous quittant, je me remets/A vous, ombres et lacs, montagnes, poésie"—makes poetry the guardian of memory: "poésie/Qui demeurez où, telle une seconde vie,/Le voyage accompli ne s'achève pas" (105). Associated with constant death and rebirth, with the disappearances and resurfacings of a subject always caught in the throes of metamor phosis, poetry for Réda is essentially a practice with a direct effect on life. The writing of a poem cannot be separated from a wider cycle of actions whose combined effect is radically to modify the individual's conditions of existence. But this begs the question of motive, inviting us to enquire how the poet views the stasis he seeks to annul in the impetus to keep moving. Although, in the presentation of successive volumes, he has progressively indicated a sense that the sequence of works from Les Ruines de Paris onwards involves a particular "itinéraire,"7 Réda has hitherto had little to say on this count. But he does seem to address it in the two poems which open and close Le Sens de la marche. In the first he entertains the thought that the "persévérant désir" for solitary flight in space and on paper—might in some way be connected with death, but he does not pursue the idea very far. In the closing poem, "Traversée du bleu," Réda points to an erotic component in his desire for open space, comparing his "traversée" to a dance, and the beauties of nature, which make him catch his breath, to a succession of alluring partners. But the Vol. XXXII, No. 2 85</page><page sequence="10">L'Esprit Créateur erotic scenario fades into a more generalised celebration of the pleasures of dissolution and union with what lies outside the self, the joy of being no more than "une forme mouvante/Parmi d'autres, nuage issu de la vapeur/Enveloppant de bleu tout l'espace" (216). We may be tempted to find Réda evasive or disingenuous in this context; yet it is central to the evolution we have been registering that he should have come to locate the poetic in a form of attention which begins precisely at the point when the anxious questions about origins and destinations have been quelled. None of his writing makes this more plain than the magnificent title essay which immediately precedes "Traversée du bleu." "Le Sens de la marche" is the account of an abortive Sunday-after noon trip to Versailles. Having evoked in some detail the frame of mind in which one might decide to go there—the pervasive air of unreality which reigns in the gardens, the limitless perspectives which seem to unblock ("déblayer") corresponding vistas in ourselves (191)—Réda describes, often in stunningly minute detail, the stages of a journey which, owing to an unexplained breakdown of the railway service, never reaches its destination. As the afternoon unfolds, non-arrival comes to seem not only entirely consistent with, but the supreme realisation of, what arrival portended, and of what the stimulus to depart had dis closed: "l'intense pulsion du limité vers ce qui le délivre" (191). As he progressively acknowledges that he is not going to get anywhere, the realisation that "le but n'est jamais qu'un symbole" (196) fully sinks in, and the realities of journeying, available anywhere at any point, come to galvanize Réda's attention. In the initial stages, while the trip is still "on," Réda treats us to the rêveries of the expectant traveller whose thoughts oscillate between his surroundings and the emotions of depar ture. Broaching a central theme, he explains the desirability of finding a seat "dans le sens contraire de la marche" so that the landscape, instead of coming at us as a series of piecemeal percepts to be hurriedly checked off before they disappear behind our heads, spreads itself out ("se déploie") in an endless process of renewal without, at any particular point, seeming to change or disappear. Disagreeing with Claudel, who had accused those who face backwards of being slaves to the "douceurs vénéneuses de la nostalgie," Réda argues that to have one's back to the engine is to experience "la profusion merveilleuse du monde qui ruisselle sans autre berge que l'horizon" (199). In the event, Réda's train to Versailles makes an impromptu halt after a few minutes, and he spends the rest of the afternoon marooned in 86 Summer 1992</page><page sequence="11">Sheringham the limbo of an unfamiliar station, with a gaggle of strangers, as trains occasionally pass in the wrong direction, or stop only to disgorge passen gers before firmly snapping shut their doors. Initially, his thoughts dwell on the particular varieties of silence and peace which attend those occa sions when a train stops nowhere in particular: "on baigne dans le pro fond mais vibrant silence de l'immobilité ferroviaire, peuplé de menus grincements, craquements brefs, soupirs dans le labyrinthe des tuyauteries" (201). But more and more his mind resists such "dérives" into reminiscence and conjecture and settles for its immediate surround ings, in belated recognition of the fact that "tout endroit mérite attention et déférence" (204). There follows an enchanting series of descriptions: the station building and its environs; the railway line and its constituent parts—steel rails, wooden sleepers still bearing the mark of the axe, the endlessly satisfying crunchiness of ballast ("le cailloutis rauque et gras qui grommelle" [208]); the smells of the railway: "Une ligne de chemin de fer est une odeur qui va par les campagnes . . . une sorte de trace animale qu'on piste avec ferveur car elle a le goût de réglisse noire qui se mâche dans l'âme des insoumis" (208). By this point Réda's essay has become an anthology of the forms of attention the most humdrum place can—should?—provoke. He composes a poem on the theme of station platforms and the quality of waiting they may stimulate, noting that the adoption of a different rhythm of discourse may offset a feeling of "enlisement" (210); and this leads into the passage quoted earlier, regarding the patch of sky with cloud and wires, which concludes as follows: Pour moi ma destination est atteinte. A travers le lacis des fils je m'élève vers la région lumineuse où, comme une roue tournant autour de son axe inflexible, les nuages, les heures, les trains, la vie passent et ne passent pas (211). At once intensely committed to the real and lucidly abstracted from many of its blandishments, "Le Sens de la marche" traces the outline of a postmodern poetry of meditation.8 Coolly insouciant towards conclu sions, passionately attached to the intervals and interstices between the goal-seeking activities of the community, Réda's essay is an invaluable allegory of the poetic quest, comparable, in its emphasis on place and passage, with Yves Bonnefoy's "Les Tombeaux de Ravenne" or Philippe Jaccottet's "A travers un verger." Rather than hallow a string of super charged moments, as he was wont to do in earlier work, Réda, through Vol. XXXII, No. 2 87</page><page sequence="12">L'Esprit Créateur the unstable, asymmetrical interplay of prose and poetry, poetic and pro saic, récit and metaphorical tableau, refuses all stable discriminations in the name of a boundless attendveness. Committed to a receptivity born of waiting and thus to a forward élan, Réda may seem reluctant to look back, to scrutinise the origins of his desire to be in motion. But in fact he knows that every word gives him away. What makes jazz so distinctively human, he once noted, is that "l'élan incandescent vers le sublime n'y peut être séparé d'un surgissement brûlant de l'obscur."9 So it is with Réda and his poetry where the darkness of lost desire is patent in the light of ever-renewed desiring.10 University of Kent at Canterbury Notes 1.
