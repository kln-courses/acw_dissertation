<plain_text><page sequence="1">RSQ Articles METAPHOR IN ARGUMENTATION What are we really saying in our textbooks and articles on argumentation? Have we examined fully enough the language we employ? Specifically, have we looked carefully enough at the commonly used metaphors? This article is based on the assumption that we have not, and that we ought to. Metaphors give focus, visualization, and power. They help to make material understandable, interesting, concrete, concise, compelling, and memorable. They flash by us so rapidly and quietly that we may not even be aware of their presence. Like subliminal advertising, they may well be subtly influencing us more than we realize. We unconsciously absorb their images and underlying assumptions, unmindful of what they are doing to us and to the subject matter. We need to give more thought to the presence of metaphors in our argumentation vocabulary, to enter knowingly into their images if we so desire, but at least to know we are doing so. It is ironic that in a subject such as argumentation we have not in the past given sufficient attention to the presence and power of metaphors. We may not have been so "scientific" and literal in our language as we think we have, and our scholarly analyses may well have been twisted as well as illuminated. Centuries ago Aristotle admonished that "the greatest thing by far is to be a master metaphor." Since then we have by no means exhausted our exploration of its power, any more than we have completed our probing of the power of the atom. This article explores the metaphors used most prominently in textbooks and articles in the field of argumentation. The following arbitrary categorization is utilized: (1) journey metaphor, (2) edifice metaphor, (3) adhesive metaphor, (4) military metaphor, (5) natural phenomena metaphors, (6) anthropomorphic metaphors, (7) miscellaneous human activity metaphors, and (8) artifact metaphors. The journey metaphor, commonly present in the lexicon of problem-solving, is a major image in argumentation. It is spatial. It is dynamic. It moves from point A to point B, from here to there. It has a beginning and an end, a starting point and a destination. In argumentation we begin with a premise, and the destination is the conclusion (claim). We say we "arrive" at conclusions. We "move" from particulars to a conclusion in induction; we "move" from data to claim. The verb indicating the l Aristotle, Poetics, trans.

Vernon Jensen, "Metaphorical Constructs for the Problem-Solving Process," The Journal of Creative Behavior, 9(Second Quarter, 1975), 116- 1 18. 201</page><page sequence="2">Articles RSQ movement is often "to lead," that is, we say that certain premises "will lead" us to this conclusion, or that these data "led" us to make this claim. We "put forward" our claims, we "go forward" with our case, we "advance" our arguments. We speak of a "step- by-step" process or assert that a particular argument is an important "step" toward our conclusion. The warrant "carries" us to a claim. Strong reasons "drive" or "force" us to a conclusion. Looking back from the destination point, we say that conclusions "followed" from certain premises. We may ask, "Does it follow . ?" Debaters may accuse their opponents of "going up blind alleys," or of "not getting anywhere" with their line of reasoning. Arguments "follow paths." In short, imbedded in our vocabulary in argumentation is a heavy reliance on the image of journeying, of traveling from one place to another. Along the way, we may encounter difficulties, that is, fallacies, which are "obstacles" or "pitfalls" which we should avoid lest they endanger our journey, or at least slow us down. Much use is made of the image that sound reasoning is "straight" thinking, whereas fallacious reasoning is "crooked," leading us to "go astray." In other words, that which enables us to proceed toward our destination in a straight, undiverted line is good, whereas that which causes us to take a winding route is bad. In the former we reach our destination presumably more accurately, more surely, more quickly, and with fewer bruises. The use of emotion, we assert, causes us to "by-pass" reason on our journey. "Pitfall" has become virtually a dead metaphor with our modern freeways and paved roads. We have forgotten the powerful image of the old dangerous footpath or winding narrow roads where deep crevices-- pitfalls--were an ever present danger. A frequent, virtually inherent,3 component of the journey metaphor is the "burden" image. On many journeys we are carrying something which often is heavy or awkward, that is, a burden. In argumentation we say that on the way to their conclusions, claim- makers have the "burden of proof" which they must "carry" and must deal with as part of the understood rules of the journey. The "burden" of refutation "rests on," "falls on" arguers, much like a heavy load rests on the shoulders of a traveller. Another spatial image which is closely related to the journey metaphor is the foci metaphor. We urge someone to "get to the point" when that person is, according to the impatient receiver, not dealing with the issue at hand. Debaters may accuse the opposition of talking "around" a point, or charge that "that's beside the point" when the comment expressed seems to be irrelevant. 3 See Weller Embler, "Three Metaphors," ETC., 35 (March, 1978), 28 - 9. 202</page><page sequence="3">RSQ Articles The edifice metaphor4 is one of the most important images utilized in the language of argumentation. In contrast to the horizontal journey metaphor, it is a vertical image, where the movement is upward or downward. A number of terms and expressions are related to the "foundation" component. Evidence is the "foundation" on which an argument "rests." As Ehninger, in one of his textbooks, began a chapter entitled, "The Foundation of Argument: Evidence," he included an interesting visual aid depicting that image.5 We speak of the "grounds" of our beliefs, assert that our beliefs are "well-grounded," are on "solid ground." We are admonished to be careful when we "lay the ground-work" for our case. We should build on "bed rock," on some "firm footing." A weak argument, we say, is "shaky" or "on shaky ground." We seek to "undergird" our case with good evidence, to have sound "underlying" reasons. Furthermore, we often say we have an urge to "get to the bottom" of the issues. Once the foundation is secure, we seek to "build," to "construct," our case. We "support" our case with evidence, like pillars holding up an edifice. We speak of logical "support," or of the need for "supporting" a generalization. Ehninger included in his textbook an interesting drawing in which in the construction of a bridge, evidence was depicted as the pilings, the warrant as the superstructure, and the claim as the roadway, resting on the other two.6 We seek to "bolster" or "firm up" our case if attacked by the opposition, and in rebuttal we endeavor to "re-build" our case. In the meantime, of course, we seek to "tear down," to "destroy" the opposition's case. We seek to "cut out from under them" our opponent's contentions, like destroying pillars holding up a building. We seek to "undercut" their assertions, just as in felling a tree we literally "undercut" as an initial step in sawing it down. A tree, after all, is an edifice of nature. We seek to "undermine" the credibility of the opposition's sources. Recent years have seen the increased use of the adhesive metaphor in the language of argumentation, so that now it is at the center of that lexicon. The aim of argumentation is expressed for the arguer to win the "adherence" of the receivers. This "sticking together" of the claim maker and the receiver is central to the whole process of argumentation. We want the receiver to "adhere" to our claims. This "adhesive" characteristic, the joining of two entities, is a metaphorical way of expressing identification (consubstantiality), terms and concepts central in Kenneth Burke's works, whereby 4 See Leland M. Griffin, "The Edifice Metaphor in Rhetorical Theory," Speech Monographs. 27 (1969). 279 - 92. 5 Douglas Ehninger, Influence, Belief, and Argument (Glenview, Ill.: Scott, Foresman, 1974), p. 51. 6 Ibid., p. 11. 203</page><page sequence="4">Articles RSQ arguer and arguee remain two but yet are one. The two persons come together in their views, just as two objects are made to stick together by some adhesive tape or glue. We also speak of "sticking" to one's argument, and are admonished that in our refutation we should "stick to" the opponent's case. We speak of having a "firm attachment" to our case, of "clinging" to our assertations. Debaters wonder if their favorite analogies will "hold". We speak of the "mortar" of reasoning, asserting that it "holds together" the bits of evidence. Part of the adhesive image is the chain metaphor, where entities are held together by links. We want arguments to "link" together, and we speak of the "chain of argument," "cognitive linkages," and of "links" in the reasoning process. We assert that arguments can grow out of others in a "chain-like" manner. We speak of the "link" between the items being compared in an analogy, and sometimes an arguer may extend an analogy to the "breaking point." We speak of a "line" of reasoning, a connected presentation which on ocassion may be "broken." We also speak of the "state of alignment" between source and receiver. The military metaphor, common in many persuasive campaigns, understandably is often used in the language of argumentation, for two forces are vying for supremacy. There is a "clash" of different points of view. We speak of "attacking," repulsing," "containing," or "destroying" the opposition, and of "defending" ourselves. We "attack on many fronts" by trying to have a variety of credible evidence, numerous strong reasons, sound assumptions, and an accurate analysis. We "marshall" and "deploy" our resources, and develop "strategies." We "take a stand," electing to "fight it out" on certain points, but sometimes we may have to "retreat to a more defensible position." We speak of the status quo as being "entrenched." We speak of the "cut and thrust" of debate, as if it were hand-to-hand combat. Some debaters may engage in "sandbagging," that is, leaving a location in the line of defense purposefully weak to draw the enemy into it, but then have reserves behind the line ready to stop and overwhelm the invader. Emotional appeals, we often assert, "trigger" unthinking responses. Richard Whately's early nineteenth century discussion of presumption employed an extensive vivid military metaphor, which, since it is still used in contemporary argumentation textbooks, has probably helped to "entrench" the military metaphor in our lexicon: 'Presumption' in favour of any supposition, means . . . a pre-occupation of the ground, as implies that it must stand good till some sufficient reason is adduced against it . . . . A body of troops may be perfectly adequate to the defence of a fortress against any attack that may be made on it; and yet, if ignorant of the advantage they possess, they sally forth into the open field to encounter the enemy, they may suffer a repulse. At any rate, even if strong enough to act on the offensive, they ought still to keep possession of their fortress. In like manner, if you have the 'Presumption' on your side, and can but refute all the arguments brought against you, you have, 204</page><page sequence="5">RSQ Articles for the present at least, gained a victory . . . . No one is called on (though he may find it advisable) to defend an existing institution, till some argument is adduced against it.7 The aspect of "strength" is often used in connection with the military metaphor. Debaters wonder if their arguments will be "strong" enough to "hold off" the "attacks" of the opposition. We seek to "weaken" our opponent's case. We speak of the "strength" of our evidence. We question whether an alleged cause is "strong" or "powerful" enough to produce the claimed effect. Numerous images in the language of argumentation spring from natural phenomena. The image of a ravine, a gap, over which we must move is central to our inductive "leap" concept, where we need to "'jump" to conclusions, since we are dealing only with probability and not certainty as in deduction. We speak of the "credibility gap," the lack of trust between communicator and receiver, which needs to be "bridged." Warrants are said to "bridge" evidence and claims. The image of a hill is portrayed with our term "slippery slope." Fallacies are said to be "smokescreens." "Snap" judgments are quick and startling like the snapping of a branch. The power of analogy is to put things in a new "light," and Osborn has convincingly "illuminated"' the power of the archetypal light-dark metaphor.8 Debaters set up a "strawman," which can easily be knocked down. Zoology enters our lexicon with our expression the "horns" of a dilemma, to depict two and only two options, both bad, like the horns of a dangerous bull. Dilemmas can be successfully handled by "slipping between the horns" (inserting an additional option) or by "taking the bull by the horns," and presumably subduing it. To ignore an issue we say is to be "ostrich-like," hiding one's head in the sand. One important sub-category of nature metaphors is the husbandman image. That is, we seek to "plant" our ideas in the minds of the receivers. We may contend that an analogy contains the "seeds" of a good argument. We are admonished to "dig" for the facts, and to "weed out" the weak arguments in our case. An argument "grows" with the accumulation of data. The anthropomorphic metaphor is also heavily employed in the language of argumentation. We speak of the "anatomy" of a dispute. The association with human posture is often made, that is, we give much thought to what "stance," "posture," or "position," we should take on an issue. We want our arguments to "stand on their own two feet." 7 Richard Whately, Elements of Rhetoric, ed. by Douglas Ehninger (Carbondale, III.: Southern Illinois University Press, 1963), pp. 112- 14. 8 Michael Osborn, "Archetypal Metaphor in Rhetoric: The Light-Dark Family," Quarterly Journal of Speech, 53 (April, 1967), 115-26. 205</page><page sequence="6">Articles RSQ A host of metaphors are utilized which relate to miscellaneous activities in which humans engage, such as weaving, weighing, doing arithmetic, filtering, health care, economic transactions, decorating one's house or self, ironing, playing games, betting, and congregating. We speak of "weaving" together bits of evidence into a "beautiful" argument, and we talk about the "fabric" of reasoning. An inadequate solution is referred to as mere "patchwork." We speak of "weighing" the evidence. A debate judge "weighs" both sides, and we hope our argument "outweighs" the opposition's case, that our arguments "carry more weight." We hope to "tip the scale" in our favor with a convincing rebuttal. In testing an analogy we question whether the similarities "outweigh" the dissimilarities. Engaged in mathematical tasks, we often "add up" series of figures, and similarly in induction we ask what do the particulars "add up to?" We sum up the items by making a conclusion.9 Confronted in today's world with hosts of filters--gas, air, oil, smoke, water--we see clearly the image when we speak of "filtering" ideas through the minds of both the arguer and the receiver. Health care is the source of metaphors. We speak of the "inoculation" technique in refutation. A superficial solution is a "bandaid" approach. "Poisoning the well" is a questionable technique. The world of finance is brought in when we assert that backing "certifies" a warrant, and that a warrant "certif ies" or "underwrites" the leap from evidence to claim. Decorating one's house or person provides clear images for a superficial solution, when we accuse the claim maker of merely "papering" or "varnishing" over some problem or of presenting a merely "cosmetic" solution. We speak of "ironing out" the "wrinkles" in our plan. Parlor games provide familiar images when we say we fit our pieces of evidence together like a "jig saw puzzle," and when we speak of the "domino" theory and "card stacking." We speak of induction as being a "wager," a "bet," that is, promulgating a conclusion which we cannot guarantee, but of which we are quite sure. The human urge to congregate and be with others make the "bandwagon" image a compelling one. Some metaphors in argumentation are based on artifacts commonly used by humans. To illustrate, we might cite such things as electrical apparatus, furniture, door thresholds, and clothing. Appeals to emotion, many textbooks assert, "short-circuit" our reasoning process, our critical faculties. This injects an unfortunate two-valued image, that is, just as the light is either on or off, so are we led to think that either emotion or reason is operative. It loses sight of the reality that we probably continue to use both, but in a varying proportion in certain situations. We "turn the tables" on our opponents, that is, using their evidence we reverse the conclusion, just like turning a table upside down. In discussing proof, we use the door threshold image. We say that proof is that which is necessary to move some one over the threshold into 9 See J. Vernon Jensen Argumentation: Reasoning in Communication (New York: D. Van Nostrand, 1981), p. 141. 206</page><page sequence="7">RSQ Articles acceptance, just as when a person steps over the threshold of a door into another room. Clothing is used when we charge that the opposition's arguments are merely a "cloak" to cover up something, such as their real motives or objectives. By tracing the journey, edifice, adhesive, military, natural phenomena, anthropomorphic, human activity, and artifact metaphors imbedded in our vocabulary in argumentation, this article has sought to increase awareness of their presence and potential power. Metaphors generate ideas and shape the way we look at a subject. Hopefully we now will see more clearly the study of metaphor is a study of invention 10 (and to some degree, disposition) more than a study of style. Thought and metaphor blend together; metaphor is part of the thought, not an artificial stylistic frosting on the cake. Language, and specifically metaphorical language, indeed does affect our thinking, just as our thinking affects our language. As one writer has recently put it, "Some metaphors are harmless, some are useful, some are beautiful, and some are stumbling blocks to clear thinking. 11 It would indeed be ironic if the deeply imbedded metaphors in our argumentation lexicon serve as stumbling blocks to clear thought. We need to make sure that we are masters of our metaphors, rather than letting them master us. J.
