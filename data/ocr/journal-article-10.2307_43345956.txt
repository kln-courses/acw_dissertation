<plain_text><page sequence="1">345 SOME SHEPHERDS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS Socio-political ' Reality ' in 15th and 16th Century Pastoral Drama In medieval and renaissance society power is always considered the exclusive privilege of the members of upper classes, because of their alleged superiority, which they try to illustrate and to maintain in many ways. That fact explains why creativity linked to normative cultural manifestations is, because of its socio-political implica- tions, declared the privilege of those classes, which rapidly show a natural propensity for considering real knowledge non-sharable: intellectual information, esoterically formulated, is de facto inaccessible to the non-initiated.1 In practice this means that upper classes claim superiority not only by right of birth, but also because of their pretension to be the only ones to understand the creations of artistic and humanistic virtù.2 Specific parts of creativity therefore become areas of reserved hunting-ground for the nobility. This, however, does not necessarily imply that every manifestation of creativity is always inextricably linked to well-defined religious or socio-political classes. On the contrary, we regularly observe fluctuations in the use of the different modi dicendi : in the 12th century the romance seems to be the outstanding focus of (upper) class interests; in the following centuries this particular form of writing is also used by the 'bourgeoisie'. In the 15th century it again becomes a useful instrument for expressing the ideals of the nobility, but now in a very different manner. The same goes, for instance, for poetry: the discriminative function of sophisticated troubadour-texts - and here one only has to think of the trobar clus- tradition - is taken over, in the sixteenth century, by erudite poetry.3 In the 15th and 16th century theatre and spectacle (two different things but frequently going hand in hand) combine the already mentioned mechanisms. In this period the theatre tends to promote only the interests of the dominating class at the expense of its original target group, that is to say, the whole of society. The construction of special theatres with access limited either to those who could afford the entrance fee or to the happy few accredited at the court where the performance was to take place, is the best sign of this particular development.4 Nevertheless the common people continue to benefit from theatre and spectacle, yet only in a passive way: rulers know very well that power is only functional when expressed collectively. Three examples will suffice to illustrate this. In the socio-political field there is the reduction of the train of floats in the Italian towns, originally organized and paid for by the guilds. The remainder of the floats now only serves (often allegorically) the glorification of the local ruler.5 In the religious sphere the ban on mystery-plays considered too profane, by the Parliament of Pāris (1548), or too catholic in</page><page sequence="2">346 MARTIN GOSMAN Elizabethan England, restricts once again the influence of the lower classes.6 And the very use of sophisticated stylistic devices as well as of an enriched lexicon, mostly based on intellectualized allusions, eliminates the non-initiated.7 Thus we notice that the theatre becomes more and more a propagandistic instrument serving explicitly the religious or political purposes of those in power. Among the plays to be mentioned here, are the Abraham sacrifiant of Théodore de Bèze, La Guisiade of Pierre Matthieu, but also Tasso's Aminta and Guarini's Pastor Fido . The dogmatic ideas circulating in aristocratic circles are clearly visible in plays like La Guisiade , where the author does not shun outspoken points of view, but in the fiction of the pastoral drama socio-political interests are only implicit. In the following paragraphs I shall briefly explore some of the paradoxes characterizing the (non-religious and non-allegorical) pastoral drama, where fiction is not only motivation, but pretext as well. In pastoral drama the world of the shepherds and that of the nobility, fundamen- tally incompatible, seemingly achieve a kind of integration, which, however, does not go beyond its own acoustic and optical illusion. As far as the former is concerned, the pastoral drama does not really differ from the static, largely verbally performed theatre of that period: "vivre la pastorale, c'est d'abord la dire."8 It is mainly the persuasiveness of the word that suggests the other world represented on stage. Optically speaking the use of expensive costumes and pieces of scenery radically alters the social reality of the rural people, whom, of course, the ruler and his courtiers want to keep at bay. It is not without interest to note here that in real society shepherds do not rank very high; hierarchically speaking they belong to the lowest classes. The paradox already announces itself: pastoral drama pretends to eliminate social differences by constructing a non-existing world governed by a sociologically inacceptable equality. I shall come back to that later on. When speaking of pastoral drama, it is important to repeat here that this particular theatrical mode is rather difficult to define. One only has to think of Poliziano's Orfeo (1480) where the story of Orpheus and Eurydice is relocated in a pastoral setting, of Juan del Encina's Cristino y Febea (1510?), which combines pastoral elements with Christian contemptus mundi motives, of Torquato Tasso's Aminta (1573) stressing the gratuitousness of the pastoral life enacted by the nobles, and of Battista Guarini's Pastor Fido (1596/8) betraying, sometimes, the influence of the Counter Reformation. All these texts find their inspiration in the same age-old tradition which has influenced, amongst others, Iacopo Sannazaro's Arcadia (1504), Jorge de Montemayor's Diana (1558), Remy Belleau's Bergerie (1565, 1572) and Sir Philip Sidney's Old Arcadia (about 1580). Intertextual referentiality is characteristic of this particular 'genre', where, in medieval (theoretical) terms, the ordinēs of laboratores and bellatores apparently achieve a fictitious harmony. One only has to think of the traditional names given to the 'actors' (Greimasian sense!) drawing a</page><page sequence="3">Some Shepherds Are More Equal Than Others 347 kind of typological halo around their persona as well as of the seemingly fixed settings and roles.9 For this reason we have to approach the favole pastorali from a comparatisi perspective. A necessarily limited analysis of the most salient paradoxes in some of the best known pastoral dramas may give an impetus to a reconsideration of the propagan- distic value of these plays. Four texts are of interest here: Poliziano's Orfeo , Encina's Cristino y Febea , Tasso's Aminta and Guarini's Pastor Fido . All those texts evoke a different world, in which the moral and philosophical concept of a lost Golden Age, which keeps hovering in the background, creates the illusion of a better society characterized by a simpler way of life. This explains why many critics like to underline the Utopianism of pastoral drama.10 Erroneously, I think, and for three reasons: 1) one of the essential features of a Utopia or 'Utopian structure', is the fact that the situation it describes, is always a final stage.11 A Utopia is perfection incarnated (hence the moralism); there is nothing after Utopia. 2) Utopia never coincides with the hic-et-nunc situation of its addressees. It is just an alternative that has no links whatsoever with the extant world: every Utopian society is not only completely different in character; geographically speaking it is also elsewhere and hardly to be located (if locatable at all). Information regarding Utopia can only be obtained from someone who has been given the privilege of spending some time there. 3) a Utopia is a moral and philosophical construction that does NOT exist.12 Taking into account the society suggested in a play - and here I limit myself to pastoral drama - one cannot but conclude that a) the perfection evoked does exist, but that it never outlasts its performance: one is always dealing with an ad-hoc production and consumption; b) no attempt at all is made to present the socio-political situation on stage as a possible alternative for the historical situation of the audience; c) there is no intermediary commenting on the things the scene is supposed to represent (no interpretative figure, such as Hythlodaeus here as in More's Utopia ); d) from time to time - and this seems to be a paradox - assimilation between the world of the actors and the one of the audience is undeniable. Considering that the sole aim of pastoral drama seems to be entertainment and possibly, but not necessarily, instruction, it is impossible to speak of a Utopia stricto sensu : in the pastoral drama there is no real separation between the staged world and daily life.</page><page sequence="4">348 MARTIN GOSMAN As stated before, the fictitious world evoked before the eyes of the audience does exist; people not only see it, but also hear it and, sometimes, even smell it.13 Apart from these hedonistic elements there is also the plot that ensures the process of assimilation which may be furthered by means of, at least, four devices: 1) by references to the place of action, sometimes very explicit, sometimes only evident to the initiated: "cui .../da l'uno a l'altro mare, e per li lieti/colti di fecondissime campagne/e per gli alpestri dossi d'Apennino." Tasso {Aminta f) is speaking here of Ferrara on the river Po;14 2) the local ruler is formally referred to: in his prologue to his Pastor Fido Guarini directly addresses the duke Carlo Emmanuele I of Turin and his bride Caterina, daughter of Philip II of Spain: "... o magnanimo Carlo . . ." and "O fanciulla real . . ." gran Caterina;15 3) the names of the characters of the play refer to identifiable contemporary persons. In the Aminta Tirsi is probably Tasso himself, Mopso evokes Sperone Speroni, etc.16 4) the spectators pretend to move in the same world as the actors: at the performance of De' Sommi's Hirifile (Mantua, 1566) both the actors and the audience were very expensively dressed. Of course, the costumes of the duke and his courtiers outshone those of the 'shepherds'.17 The assimilation of the artificial staged world with the highly stylized one of the court has been achieved.18 Thus, Filarete's theory, as formulated in his Trattato di Architettura (1460-4) is confirmed once again: in watching the play, in which every detail 'signifies', the audience honours itself in the personae of its rulers.19 In pastoral drama the gap between nobility and pastoral people is bridged by arguments taken from literary fiction: the so-called shepherd is, for a while, admitted to the self-sufficient, yet sterile circle of the courtiers. That which the latter see (or are allowed to see) is merely an impersonation of a traditional literary artefact. As in the romance, the heroes and their environment are just stylized items. The result is a simulated 'other world', which has the appearance of an entertaining confirma- tion of the aristocratic otium (hunting, discussions of emotional matters, etc.). We are still dealing with the medieval attitude towards mimesis : why try to imitate Nature created by God Himself? His perfection cannot be surpassed. And 'reality' in the ISth and 16th century is still a psychological and sociological problem (notwithstanding the sometimes spectacular progresses made in philology and archaeology based on empiricism). Pastoral drama is just a literary and ritual translation of princely power striving for absolutism. This becomes very clear when one analyses in the above mentioned texts those elements that - in spite of the pretensions of Golden Age equality as well as innocence - have socio-political connotations.</page><page sequence="5">Some Shepherds Are More Equal Than Others 349 In Poliziano's Orfeo one detects a certain internal social hierarchy: . . al servo sta bene ubbidire/e matto è chi commanda al suo signore" says Tirsi, Aristeo's servant.20 His part, though relatively unimportant, could be seen as an attempt to guarantee a certain plausibility: even the society depicted in the Orfeo has its social hierarchy. Remarkable, though, is the role of the gods Orfeo goes to see in order to recover his beloved Euridice. Their status is exclusively mythological and does not really confer a specifically religious accent to the text: they are just the traditional Proppian opponents. The Orfeo depicts a world, which, like the one represented in the medieval Celtic stories, ignores the existence of barriers between the world of the mortals and that of the immortals. But it is very clear that Poliziano's mortals (at least some of them) have to take into account the possible actions of opponents other than natural ones like snakes, wolves and bears.21 Though some internal hierarchy seems to condition the life of the 'shepherds', they are never confronted with an extensively elaborated socio-political system. In Juan del Encina's Cristino y Febea ,22 although strongly influenced by the Italian tradition, things are presented in a different way. This play confronts three worlds: the shepherds', the hermit's, and that of the upper class. The presence of the hermit's cabin is remarkable. However, the part of religion is reduced to the role of temporary opponent: Cristino's withdrawal from the secular world brings him into conflict both with his love for Febea and the good life he had as a shepherd. As in other pastoral settings, the central theme is embodied by Amor, who advocates the traditional theories linked to the pastoral 'genre': no pastoral life without love! As far as the aristocratic world is concerned, it should be noted that the pastoral life in this play discloses a number of 'realistic' details rendering impossible any identification with an aristocratic audience. Two examples should be mentioned here. Justino, the companion of Cristino, praises the traditional pastoral dishes, which are not likely to be found on princely tables: "¡Gran plazer es sorver lecho/ que aproveche y ordeñar la cabra mocha/y comer la miga cocha!"23 At the end of the play, when Cristino dances on the occasion of his return to pastoral life, he is unable to perform an aristocratic dance: . . que es un poco palanciano."24 Encina's pastoral world cannot possibly rival the world of the courtiers. If this play was ever performed at court (which is not impossible, since Juan del Encina was at the service of Don Fadrique Alvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba)25 the process of assimilation I mentioned earlier, would have had to be excluded: the implicated modi vivendi are ontologically incompatible. However, the aristocratic dance Cristino could not perform implies the superiority of the upper class. Tasso's Aminta is quite clearly addressed to a specific audience. Not only, as stated above, are the characters of the Aminta , though typologically moulded, historically recognizable - and this is a paradox - but, moreover, the many literary quotations from other authors as well as allusions to mythological learning can solely be</page><page sequence="6">350 MARTIN GOSMAN appreciated by an initiated audience living according to the rules of the already mentioned aristocratic virtù . All this is sufficiently documented. Hence it is not necessary to linger over further details.26 It is interesting to note though that Tasso's pastoral world has an internal hierarchy as well as an external motivation. The main characters are of divine origin: Silvia is the granddaughter of the "dio di questo nobil fiume" and Aminta is the grandson of "Päne. . . il gran dio de' pastori" (1, 1: 87, 89). This incites Dafne to ask Silvia whether Aminta is not good enough for her, which is, of course, a purely rhetorical question. The presence of an internal social hierarchy is obvious,27 otherwise the question would have been completely irrele- vant. The awareness of the existence of social ranks is, among other things, confirmed by the wealth of Montano, Silvia's father: he is "richissimo d'armenti" (I, 2: 71) . Social distinctions are also echoed in the words of the satyr, who is not only rejected by the fair Silvia on account of his repulsive exterior and of his social maladjustment, but also because of his poverty. His long monologue betrays the existence of a socio-political stratification characterizing this favola boschereccia : "Non sono io brutto, no né tu mi sprezzi perché si fatto io sia, ma solamente perché povero sono: ahi, ché le ville seguon l'essempio de le gran cittadi; e veramente il secol d'oro è questo, poiché sol vince l'oro e regna l'oro." (II, 1: 53-8) The satyr's words contradict Tasso's own ode to Golden Age. As for the external motivation, the ideal of the "bella età d'oro" is undermined still further if we take into account the fact that the pastoral world of Aminta and Sylvia is located within a stone's throw of the town of Ferrara, "presso la cittade" where the duke's "felice albergo" is to be found. In this princely "albergo" - and here Tasso himself destroys the carefully built-up image of self-sufficient pastoral perfection - people become better persons. Tirsi's account of his stay at the Ferrara court, where he felt himself being transformed into a better person ("pien di nova virtù, piena di nova deitade"), where he too sang of "guerre ed eroi, sdegnando pastoral ruvido carme" (II, 2: 274, 298-300), denies the core of pastoral life. The 'real' shepherd, that is to say the one of noble lineage, cannot only function at the court of genuine aristocracy, but there he also becomes an other, a better person. Once he has realized this, he begins to deny his former pastoral life, and replaces it by the world of the bellatores , where epic and knightly virtues determine the traditionally hedonistic values. In other words: Tasso's illusory Golden Age, like all other pastoral worlds turns out to be an intellectual construct, but it is functional if dominated by a typical 16th-century courtly civilization: the above-quoted words of the satyr already indicate the stress laid upon the "ville" ('little villages') by the</page><page sequence="7">Some Shepherds Are More Equal Than Others 35 1 normative guidelines coming from the "gran cittadi", centres of courtly activities and interests as well as - and this is very important - administrative focal points of what, already in Tasso's time, was shaping itself as the basis of the modern State: the traditional opposition between countryside and town/court is being replaced now by a certain 'national', purely administrative, cohesion.28 Tasso's pastoral scenery is rather complex. On the one hand his (pretended) pastoral world is far from egalitarian; on the other hand, the vague allusions to the court suggest some sociological ambivalence: the court sometimes figures as a model to imitate, but it is also a "magazzino de le dande" (II, 2: 245). Of course, being a decent and functional courtier, Tasso would only imply here the courtiers, never the prince himself. Guarini's Pastor Fido differs considerably from the Aminta ; its internal structure is clearly dominated by some kind of institutionalized religion: the behaviour of the lovers is completely controlled by the values of their society. Nicandro's words to Amarilli can only be interpreted in one way "Contra la legge di natura forse non hai, ninfa, peccato: 'Ama, se piace'; Ma ben hai tu peccato incontra quella degli uomini e del cielo: 'Ama, se lice'."29 Despite the fact that Guarini regularly refers to a Golden Age,30 we are here dealing with a philosophical rupture with the idea of an original innocence that makes man live according to the laws of nature and has him threatened only by natural enemies and anthropomorphic beasts like satyrs, etc. Guarini's world is inhabited by curious shepherds. The above mentioned sumptuosity of dress, an essential feature of the courtly pastoral drama, here too is considered a social signifier. There are not only representatives of the lower classes: Lisetta is a "pecoraia" (III, 5: 155), but Dorinda says very clearly: 'I have abandoned my own clothes and have put on ". . . abiti . . .servili" in order ". . .tra pastori/potessi per pastore esser tenuta" (IV, 2: 102-4).31 However, in Guarini's play one notices a very significant transformation and specification; there is a recognizable social stratification: the pastoral world is inhabited by shepherds, noble, sometimes demiurgical protagonists as well as priests (who see to it that the laws of society are strictly observed). Remarkable is the dogmatism with which the clergy, chiefly represented by Montano, "sacerdote di Diana, /si famoso pastore oggi e si ricco" (1,2: 84-5), defend the incontestability of the ritual.32 A last detail to be mentioned here is the opposition between urban and rural life. The words pronounced by the jealous Corisca, unable to arouse Mirtillo's love, are more than revealing:</page><page sequence="8">352 MARTIN GOSMAN .io, che tanťanni in cittadine schiera di vezzosi, leggiadri e degni amanti fui sempre insuperabile, schernendo tante speranze loro, tanti desiri, or da rustico amor, da vile amante, da rozzo pastorel son presa e vinta. . ." (I, 3: 56-61) This opposition between two different modi vivendi , already functional in Sannaza- ro's Arcadia , is also present in Tasso's Aminta , though in this last text it culminates in a positive and fertile interaction (at least that is what it pretends to do). The Pastor Fido , on the other hand, shows us two different worlds, each with its own system of values. The fact that Corisca prides herself on her amorous conquests, during her life in town - and here her words suggest some regrets - is ontologically incompatible with Arcadia's mode of life: Arcadian shepherds are only familiar with real love, monogamous love! The above analysis has shown that in the fictitious world of the pastoral drama several socio-political systems - and it must be stressed that none of these systems ever is the object of any specification or formalization - meet. As a matter of fact these systems only derive their status from the mere suggestion of their existence. The pastoral drama is characterized by, at least, five different worlds. Firstly, there is the so-called Golden Age people remember; secondly, the society real shepherds (= laboratores) live in; thirdly, the world of the aristocratic elite that lives in the same context, but which has no ties with the latter apart from hierarchical ones. In the fourth place one detects the echo of 16th-century urban life and, finally, there is the 16th-century court. Each of these social systems seems to have its own set of values. Highly remarkable is the fact that the praises of the Golden Age are regularly sung by the chorus in the Aminta , but that fact never really conditions the behaviour of the personae in the pastoral setting. What to think of the original "legge aurea e felice/ che natura scolpì: S'ei piace, ei lice" which, even in that world, could not be maintained: did not "Onor" cloth the "verginella ignude," did it not make "i dolci atti lascivi/. . . ritrosi e schivi?"33 Päradisal liberty - it could not be otherwise - just had to be channelled into decency: 16th-century thinking cannot do without regulation. True happiness will come from the optimal respecting of the rules imposed by the normative system. And this can only be the system of the court. That is why Tirsi's laudatory words on life at the (Ferrara) court in the Aminta are so significant. This looking up to the values, ethics and interests of the upper class was already evident in the prologue to Tasso's play: the noble lyre was going to replace the simple oaten reed. The shepherds on the stage are simply not allowed to live in an autonomous world built on independent values.</page><page sequence="9">Some Shepherds Are More Equal Than Others 353 i As stated before, the particular 'genre' of pastoral drama never refers to a Utopia or a 'Utopian structure'. It is purely a sublimation of traditional philosophical clichés which - and that is the real paradox - do mark essential changes in aristocratic society. Together with the emergence of absolutism, doubled by the revolution in military technique and tactics (N.B. the role of regular armies), there is a dramatic change in the status and function of the nobility. The knightly, rather independent feudal warrior has become a courtier serving and illustrating (the last verb has to be taken in its etymological sense: 'to render illustrious') princely power. But with the pen, and not at all with the sword! Life at court has become the territory of the intellectual.34 The completely subordinated (or must we say: domesticated?) aristo- cracy has permission to watch actors impersonating 'shepherds'. Sometimes, its members may even participate in the play. Despite the vagueness of the descriptions of socio-political elements, all the plays show - and that is an other paradox - a certain realism. This 'realism', however, is never the result of a deliberate attempt to imitate the real life of the laboratores . No more than in medieval times is there ever any conscious effort of mimesis : people do not even eat or drink (except in the Cristino y Febea , but that play belongs rather to the Spanish tradition, generally independent from the Italian one).35 The only 'realities' are the presence and the functionality (!) of both a socio-political stratification in the plays themselves and the leading role of the court and its ruler (the two of them only being described elliptically). Of course, the right of birth, the basic aristocratic raison d'être, must be respected. Hence it is quite logical that one not only needs to recognize traditional and consecrated social stratifications in the plays (and in literature, in general!), but also that one simply has to create a new type of 'shepherd' (who is very much unlike the real one, probably one of the poorest of society). Dressed in silk, moving in very luxurious and costly scenery and armed with inoffensive "cetra" or "sampogna." Or, preferably, with the aristocratic "usata lira."36 But not with a sword, traditional 'icon' of consecrated noble chivalry! Aminta, the grandson of "Pane. . . il dio de' pastori" is the living symbol of an aristocracy deprived of every possibility of implementing its political ambitions. Notwithstanding the fact that that aristocracy is "worthie to beare a coate of arms!"37 During the performance of the play (in the closed court ambiance: lower classes are no longer allowed to see the 'noble' interpretation of their own lifestyle), the courtier can enjoy whatever activity his prince wishes to leave him. From this point of view the pastoral drama is the most sophisticated manifestation of rising absolutism, as well as of the growing pressure of religious institutions.33 Louis XIV's court will be one of the best examples of the transformation of aristocracy: its members just play the games the king allows them to play.</page><page sequence="10">354 MARTIN GOSMAN Moreover, the bare fact that neither the 'pastoral' metaphorical world on the stage nor the 'courtly' one is ever the object of an analytical approach (the two of them are only evoked in iconic form), excludes every possibility of real comparison.39 Specifications are even taboo; allusiveness, as in mediaeval literature and historio- graphy, is essential.40 Suggestion simply does it: the prince - and only he - is the most important shepherd.41 The 16th-century courtiers have at least one small consolation: though as subservient as real shepherds, they are generally better dressed, and their locus amoenus (the court) is much more comfortable than that of Nature:42 hence they are 'more equal than the real shepherds'.43 Rijksuniversiteit Groningen Martin Gosman Notes 1 And as far as theology was concerned, even de jure : until the Reformation the study of the Scriptures had always been the privilege of the oratores. 2 For this concept, see André Chastel, "L'artista," in L'Uomo del Rinascimento , ed. Eugenio Garin (Roma/Bari: Laterza, 1988), 239-69, especially 263-8. 3 Generally speaking every 'genre' is liable to formulate new restrictions that can change its nature in such a way that other interests can be served.

Already evident in Poliziano's Orfeo , this phenomenon culminates in 16th-century poetry (here one can think of the Pléiade poets). As far as the pastoral drama is concerned, Tasso's Aminta and Guarini's Pastor Fido rely heavily on the learning of their audience. Sometimes the noble spectators need some help: in order to explain the complex mythological iconography of his tournament Guerra di Bellezza (1616) Andrea Salvadori publishes the libretto before the spectacle (Arthur R.

Gerhardt, Essai ď analyse de la pastorale dans les littératures italienne, espagnole et française (Assen: Van Gorcum, 1950). 27 Amor, in order to escape from his mother (cf. ...da lei son costretto di fuggire/ e celarmi...', 11. 13-4) has disguised himself by putting on some pastorali spoglie (1. 2). This reference to the clothing typical of a certain social category (here that of the shepherds), suggests a certain 'realism'. However, one should have no illusions about the quality of Amor's clothing: courtiers do not wear rags. 28 The idea of 'national' entity and culture becomes evident when Lorenzo de' Medici sends Frederic of Aragon the so-called Raccolta Aragonese , a collection of Tuscan poetry (Mario</page><page sequence="12">356 MARTIN GOSMAN Martelli, "Firenze. Il Quattrocento," in Letteratura Italiana. Storia e geografìa, vol. II, 1, (ed.) Alberto Asor Rosa, (Turin: Einaudi, 1988), 25-201, especially 57. For this particular phenomenon, see also Alberto Asor Rosa, "Apogeo e crisi della civiltà letteraria italiana", ìbidem: 5-21. 29 In Mario Ariani, La Tragedia. .

See note 27. 32 Especially in Act V. 33 That is what the chorus at the end of Act I sings (11. 26, 34, 40 sqq). 34 The best illustration of this changed courtly life is, of course, Castiglione's Cortegiano. Courtiers do not act any more; they just observe and comment. See also Pierre Francastel, Guardare il Teatro (Bologna: Il Mulino, 1987), 71. Courtly life seems to be peaceful. Nothing, however, could be more ironical: there alwavs is a sword . . . back-stage: ... the master's! 35 For Juan del Encina's Italian period, see J. P. Wickersham Crawford, The Spanish. . ., pp. 15-41. The same remark can be made about Garcilaso de la Vega. This Spanish poet has also been inspired by the Italian tradition, and that becomes very clear in his Egloga segunda. Cf. Paul Verdevoye, Garcilaso de la Vega. Poemas/Poèmes (Pāris: Aubier-Flammarion, 1968), 202-77. 36 See Evonne P .

Montrose, "Of Gentlemen and Shepherds: The Politics of Elizabethan Pastoral Form", English Literary History 50 (1983): 415-59, especially 431. 38 It is clear that I disagree with those critics who do not see any political implications in the pastoral drama. See, for instance. André Godard, "La première représentation de l'Aminta. La cour de Ferrare et son double," in Ville et campagne dans la littérature italienne de la renaissance , (ed.) André Rochon (Pāris: Centre de la Recherche sur la Renaissance Italienne, 1977), 187-301, especially 216. 39 See Jackson I. Cope, The Theatre and the Dream.

See, for this, Luigi Monga, "Eglogues marines et 'pescheries' au XVIe siècle," Cahiers de V Association Internationale des Etudes Françaises , 39 (1987): 21-33, especially 26 as well as Louis A. Montrose, "Eliza, Queene of. . . 158. 42 Sannazaro's hero is already a 'civilized', that is to say an 'urban' shepherd: "...in Arcadia venne non come rustico pastore ma come coltissimo giovene" (Enrico Carrara, Opere di Iacopo Sannazaro. Con saggi dell' Hypnerotomachia Poliphili e del Peregrino di Iacopo Cayiceo (Turin: Unione tipografica. Editrice Torinese, 1963), 219. He is even qualified as a napolitano pastore (ibidem: 117) thus accentuating the vanishing (administrative and political) barriers between town and country. The town has become the symbol of 'normative' happiness: all Utopia's are urban. The negative medieval idea that towns were just an invention of Cain is abandoned (see Jacques Le Goff, La Civilisation de l'Occident Médiéval (Pāris: Flammarion, 19822), 270. 43 A very interesting example of this attitude is to be found in Remy Belleau's Bergerie (1572). The ideal pastoral life is the life at the castle of Joinville! Belleau describes how the ladies-in-waiting, presented as 'shepherdesses', accompany their mistress, princess Antoinette de Bourbon, to the chapel. The princess is presented as "vne noble &amp; vertueuse creature, issue de la grande race de Pán: d'elle sont issus, comme d'vne source feconde, &amp; d'vne franche pepiniere, de grand &amp; vertueux Bergers, de sages &amp; vertueuses Bergeres,. .

His work, however, throws a fascinating light on the way 16th-century nobility tried to compensate for its losses.</page></plain_text>
