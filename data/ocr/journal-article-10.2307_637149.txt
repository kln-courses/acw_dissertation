<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DISORDERLY MOTION IN THE TIlfAIOS. So much has been written on this vexed issue,' that one hesitates to reopen it. Yet one has no other choice when one finds scholars accepting as generally agreed a view which rests on altogether insufficient evidence. I propose, therefore, to examine the main grounds on which recent authorities interpret the disorderly motion of Tm 3oa, 52d-53b, and 69b as a mythical symbol. They are four: I. That the Timaios is a myth; II. The testimony of the Academy; III. That motion could not antecede the creation of time; IV. That motion could not antecede the creation of soul. I. In what sense is the Timaios a myth? A comparison with the atomists suggests itself at once. The Timaios corrects their views in their own universe of discourse. Empedocles' cosmology starts with the four tiL&lt;paMra.2 Plato disagrees: ' These are products, not archai. I cannot give certain knowledge of the true arche or archai. But I can give an account which is a good deal more probable than any atomist's.'3 So when he fulfils this promise, going back of the four ' elements' to describe in 52d-53b the winnowing movement out of which they were formed, what he gives us is not more mythological than Empedocles' mingling of the elements in the original harmony of love,' than the primordial 7p~lu't of Anaxagoras' opotopep%,u or Leukippos' and Demokritos' world-forming 8&amp;rrv. Thus the Timaois is unique among Plato's myths. It is a mistake to put it on a level with the eschatological myths of the Gorgias, Phaidon, Refpublic x, and Phaidros.7 The Timaios offers no gentle disavowal of the scientific scrupulousness of the account by the literary devices employed in every one of these others.s The speaker is the 1 For references to opposing authorities in the last century see Zeller, Plato and the Older Academy (English transl., London, 1876, p. 364, n. 5).

The sober, systematic, prosaic tone of his discourse contrasts sharply with Kritias' earlier reminiscences. This all but irrelevant intro- duction sets the fanciful myth over against the scientific myth. It is stuffed with mythological material: Atlantis, the deluge, Phaethon's flight, and the genealogy of Phoroneus, Niobe, Deukalion and Pyrrha which even the Egyptian priest declares to be mythology (23b). None of this sort of thing comes into Timaios' story; and its omission has the force in conscious restraint in view of the wealth of poetic allusions suggested by his grandiose theme.1 When the creation of the stars forces him to say something about the popular gods, he is dry, hasty, ironical.2 He accepts the traditional accounts in a mood that suggests Hume's, ' Our most holy religion is founded on Faith.'3 Sacred mythology of this sort he treats elsewhere with the deepest respect.4 He has no use for it here. The topography of the under-world, described in such detail in the Phaiden, is left unmentioned. The chthonian deities, whose worship is an integral part of the state-cult,5 pass unnoticed. Nor is there any place here for the mediating daimonic entities, who figure invariably in Plato's supernatural hierarchy " and are conspicuous in the cosmology of the Epinomis (984e, 985a). Why should the cosmology of the Timnaios exclude figures whose reality is vouched for by the law of the state? Because they fall below its standard of scientific probability.7 Commentators often pick the expression ElKTaL pLOov out of Timaios' epistemological introduction (29b-d), and use it as though the emphasis were on i0ov instead of dK rTa. This is certainly wrong. ElK6s is the important word. It is used thrice explicitly (29c 2, 8; 29d 2), and once implicitly (29b ELKdOVOs rvyyEvEts). Of these four, it is used thrice as an adjective of X6yos, once of uOos. In the seventeen echoes of this introduction throughout the rest of the dialogue, p^6oo is used thrice,8 while IIKO', ELKOTWS, etc., are used sixteen times." ELKdTa XdyOV is used eight times; ELKdoa Mi3Ov twice. And it is a pretty commentary on the 'mythological' connotations of EdKdra IiOov that it is used both times of a purely scientific opinion: 59c, of the composition of metals, and 68d, of colour-mixture. A myth is a story; whether the story is mythology or naturalhistory depends on what kind of story it is. ActavOoXoyoD0Ev, dr E LKO'S oV70S XELy ETE j says Socrates in the Phaidon (7ob) of no less a matter than reincarnation.'0 But there is no such ambiguity in the Timaios: here only the EZKOI is tolerated. And what E1K0s means in (Ilob); KaO XP~ rT ro7aoL ^7a Waep c&amp;r~EtV avrUt (II4d). The detailed geography is clearly mythological.

The KpaTrp of 46d is the only important one; and there it occurs with the scientist's characteristic carelessness for literary detail: he thinks he has used it before (fr rdryv vp6repov KpacrSpa) when he actually has not. Expressions which he knows to be poetic Timaios expressly qualifies as similes: iAPcLddas ws s is 6xua (41e); this is a vestige of the imaginative figure of the Phaidros, where it had been used without qualification: Zek, Xa6vrwv T-?YVb1Y' &amp;p/A (246e); OeL^v XhAiara ioopp6rws ci6hvta (247b); there the mood is mythology, and to qualify would be pedantry. 2 About irony: see especially Taylor's Com. mentary on 4od 6-e 2. a An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, X. ii.

But verisimilitude is not fiction, for the visible cosmos is not fictitious. If within the dream-world of the senses 3 we draw pretty definite lines between the reality of people we see and hear and, say, Hesiod's y7yeveZ (our sanity depends on it), so scientific probability must be kept clear from didactic fictions. So the presumption must be that every element in the Timaios is probable, and none fanciful, unless we are given further instructions or hints to the contrary. Of the latter there are none for the pre-existing chaos. In their absence we are so far driven to accept it as a serious, though only probable, hypothesis of the origin of the material world. II. It is not then Plato, but Xenokrates who supplies us with the suggestion that, as Aristotle put it in de Caelo 279b 32-280a I, the expressions about the generation of the world are a kind of diagram, given SarKaAlas Xkptw. This passage of the de Caclo is 'a plain allusion to the interpretation of the Timaios given by Xenokrates."' In none of our sources is it said that Plato thus construed the Timaios; or even that Xenokrates contended that Plato thus construed it. All we hear is that Xenokrates and Krantor, or 'Xenokrates and the Platonists,' supplied this interpretation.5 Of course, we have Xenokrates' teaching at second, or rather at nth, hand. It may be that Xenokrates did make this very claim. But this is not in our evidence. Xeno- krates is, therefore, of little help at this point. For the rest, there are excellent reasons why an apologist and systematizer of Plato's thought should wish to put just that construction upon this troublesome doctrine of the Timaios. For the same reasons the Academy would conserve it. Yet their minds could not have been altogether easy about it, or we could hardly have had Plutarch, Atticus, and h&amp;A.o wro0XAol rv IIXa.aWVLKWv,5 reverting centuries later to the literal interpretation. So I can- not put as much weight on the 'all but unanimous testimony of the Academy " as Professor Taylor seems to do. On the other hand, we have Aristotle, who knows Xenokrates' interpretation and also knows something of Plato's oral teaching. So far from attributing this interpre- tation to Plato, his references to the Timaios imply the very opposite." There can be 1 The account is 'akin' to the 'image' it describes: elK6bot eClK6ras (sc.

Opin. Fr. II (quoted in Taylor's Com. mentary, p. 69, n. i). But neither does Theo- phrastos say that this is Plato's own teaching about the Timaios. He merely records this interpretation as a possible one. 6 Proklos, quoted by Taylor, Commentary, p. 68. 7 Taylor, Commentary, p. 69. 8 I.e. de Caelo 28oa 29, Phys. 251b 14, Met. 0o72a 2.

One ought to think twice before ridiculing Aristotle for taking</page><page sequence="4">74 GREGORY VLASTOS no question here of 'mere polemical "scores " got by pressing the mere words of a sentence.' His references are too detailed and too serious for that. He tells us that- (a) In teaching the generation of time Plato stood alone against the unanimous opinion of previous thinkers ; while (b) he (Aristotle) was the first to teach the beginninglessness of the ouranos;3 that (c) Plato, with Leukippos, taught the everlastingness of motion,4 yet (d) Plato held that the world and the soul were generated.5 Of these statements a and b or b and c might be, and a and c or c and d would almost certainly be taken as mutually inconsistent. To see that they are not, implies conscientious recording and thoughtful distinctions. To be sure, every reference to Plato is the prelude to a crushing refutation. But crushing refutation would be singularly inept against mythology. There can be no question here either of ignor- ance or carelessness. If we are to discount Aristotle's testimony we must charge him with deliberate misrepresentation. It is hard to believe that Aristotle, with all the limitations of his subtle and unimaginative mind, was capable of quite that. III. We now come to the more difficult part of the discussion: to the contradictions in which Plato would seem to involve himself on a literal interpretation of the pre- existing chaos. Here we must make sure of the canon of criticism on which we are to proceed. Shall we assume at the start that Plato's philosophy is immune from contradiction ? This would be sheer wish-thinking. Every great thinker has sought consistency, and none has perfectly attained it, except in the minds of slavish disciples who know the answers so well that they never think of the problems. One thing only we can reasonably assume about a great philosopher: that he is never carelessly or needlessly inconsistent. In the present instance Plato himself has warned us of rough sailing ahead. This is physics, not metaphysics; his physics must have a fringe of inconsistency and inexactness (29c 6), at the risk of belying the metaphysics. In fact Plato has much too cheap an insurance against mis- adventures in the Timaios. He can always say,' I told you so. What can you expect of the image of an image that is in constant flux ?' We cannot treat him quite so leniently. To meet his inconsistencies with easy-going tolerance would be as shallow as to hide or explain them away. We must insist on the question: Where is the source of the inconsistency ? Is it a mere accident of the physics, or can it be traced back to a weakness in the metaphysics? And of the pre-existing chaos we must ask further: Is it the cause of metaphysical inconsistency, or its symptom ? If the latter, then to remove it as mythology would be needless exegetic surgery. Let us begin with the most formidable of these inconsistencies: ' No sane man could be meant to be understood literally in maintaining at once that time and the world began together (38b 6), and also that there was a state of things, which he proceeds to describe, before there was any world.'6 But was the contradiction as obvious to Plato as it is to Professor Taylor ? And was it avoidable ? seriously the Timaios' doctrine of the soul, as does Frutiger, op. cit., p. 202. Plato, who believes, with all other Greek philosophers, that sensation involves a physiological process, must explain how the soul is ' shaken' and ' moved' in sensation (Phileb. 33d, 34a). The theory of the Timaios that the soul is a pattern of circular motion is a serious attempt to provide such an explanation. Aristotle is quite right in objecting that this implies a spatial conception of the soul. His objection would hold just as much against the Philebos as against the 'mythical' Timaios. 1 Taylor, Commentary, p. 69. 2 Phys. 25Ib 14-18. 3 de Caelo 279b 12, 13. 4 Met.

He records both of these Platonic doctrines: that motion is everlasting (Met. Io7Ib 31-33), while time is not (Phys. 251b 14-18). He interprets the latter literally. Yet he sees no immediate contradiction between the two. He does indeed hold that 'all change and all that is in motion is in time' (PAys. 222b 30, 31), and that time has no beginning (Phys. 251b 14-28), but he finds it necessary to establish these propositions independently.1 They are not immediate logical inferences from the self-contradictoriness of ' before the beginning of time.' To convict him of inconsistency Aristotle has to go farther afield and bring in the additional premiss that Plato, who ' sometimes' attributes the cause of motion to the soul, could not consistently make the generated soul cause of beginningless motion.2 Why is it, one wonders, that Aristotle should resort to such a roundabout argument, weakened as it is by the 'sometimes' in the first premiss, when he could offer the simple and fatal objection that ' before time' is nonsense, since 'before' pre- supposes time ?3 The answer is in the ' tradition running throughout the whole of Greek thought, which always associated Time with circular movement."' Aristotle justified this belief by arguing: (a) Time is the number of motion (Phys. 223a 33); (b) there is only one time (Phys. 223b 2-12); therefore, (c) time must be measured by one determinate motion (Phys. 223b 12-18); (d) this must be the motion whose number is 'most knowable' and that is uniform (I a.X `) circular motion (Phys. 223b 18-21). Note the implications of this argument: What would happen if you eliminated the uniform circular motion of the heavenly sphere ? According to Aristotle there would be no other uniform motion.5 Without uniform motion time cannot be numbered, and if it cannot be numbered is it still time? A number that cannot be numbered would be a contradiction in terms. Thus, if Aristotle adhered strictly to this assumption that time is the measure of a determinate motion, he should have been hard put to it to show any inconsistency whatever in Plato's doctrine that motion is eternal while time is not. So long as there is only irregular motion, there would be no time in this strict sense of the word. It is only when the regular motion of the heavenly bodies comes into being that time begins." This is in fact the hypothesis of the Timaios. On this hypothesis we should have to reject the validity of the argument of Phys. 222b 30-223a 15 (summarized below, n. i), which attempts to establish that time is coeval with motion. For the first premiss in that argument is that Orhrrov and flpawirepov is predicable of every motion (222b 31, 32); and to define Oa-rrov 1 He proves the first as follows: (i) 6Oarrov or lpa6trepov is predicable of every motion ; (ii) Oarrov implies the idea of rp6brepov; (iii) rp6repov implies distance from ' now'; (iv) I now'implies time (r&amp; vOU Cv Xpbvqy) (Phys. 222b 31-223a 8). He proves the second: (i) time can neither be nor be conceived apart from 'now'; (ii) any 'now' is a ebe67r-7e between past and future ; (iii) any past is a 'now'; (iv) therefore, any past has a past (Phys. 251b 19-26). 2 Met.

So Aristotle could not-and does not-use the argument of Phys. 222b 31-223a 8 against the Timaios. To dislodge Plato he has to fall back on another argument : that of Phys. 251b 19-26. Here his logic is sound. But he is no longer using the same concept of time as before; he is not working with the cyclical time of Phys. 223b I2-224a 2, but with the more general concept of a 'now' which is always a /Lcr61 between past and present. This excursus on Aristotle enables us to understand- (a) Plato's concept of cyclical time; (b) how such a concept seemed compatible with the supposition of a disorderly motion going on in the absence of time. b needs no further argument. It is a simple inference from the belief that time essentially implies periodic motion; no periodic motion, no time. a requires further comment. The doctrine of time in the Timaios is a stronger version of the cyclical time of Phys. 223b 12-224a 2. If Aristotle takes the heavenly revolutions as a necessary condition of time, the Timaios seems to identify them with time.2 It not only tells us that sun, moon, and the other five planets were 'o-a T 'e o-,rvvaJrp- y~eLo 0a Xpovov (38e),3 and were made TivE yevvWOqj XPdvos (38c), but even that the 'wandering' of the planets is time.' Nights, days, months, and years are 'parts' (r~LP XPvov, 37e), and ' was' and ' shall be' (the most general categories of temporal succession) are ' species' (E'iS, 37e 4, 38a 8) of cyclical time (KvKXov/Evov, 38a 8). Now time so conceived is not the contrary of timeless eternity, but an approxi- mation to it: its likeness (EIKOva, 37d 6), its imitation (38a 8). Time is a finished product, the end result of a raw material which the Demiurge works over with the definite purpose of making it as much like eternity as he possibly can.5 What is this raw material ? Plato tells us in 52d 3: it is y'veo-rs. This distinction between raw yEVEU-Lc and created Xpdvoa is the key to the whole account. It shows that it was just as necessary for Plato to hold that the Demiurge did not create the first, as that he did create the second. It is the nature of the Demiurge to make his work more like the eternal model, not less like it. So the one thing he could not possibly do is to bring the factor of change and decay, of ' perpetual perishing,' into existence. That is a necessary condition for his work. Given that, he can proceed to inform it with periodic motion. Since he did not create it, it must antecede creation. It must exist not as a bare nothing, but as change, though disordered change: KLVOV- /.LEVOY WrX?),LLLEXW^ KaL CLTLKTh)3. But it is not utterly disordered change. Wholly devoid of form it would be, on Platonic standards, wholly devoid of Being; i.e. nothing at all. But obviously it is not that. It is something. This must puzzle Plato, who thinks of 7'paS~ and 'i7rtpov as two distinct entities, requiring the imposition of the one upon the other through 1 Phys. 222b 33-223a 2: Ayw o R O&amp;rTov KVE'ErOcat r6b rp6repov pserapcdiXXov Eic is b70roKEL/.tvov KarT&amp; d a6LT &amp;d6Oa-rnlya Klai 6h la X j Pv KV'Y7OLP KLPVOLEPOV.. 2 I say ' the Timaios,' rather than 'Plato,' in view of Patm. i5xe-157b, to which Professor Cornford has called my attention.

There Plato is thinking of a different aspect of the problem: he is contrasting Xp6vos as the spread of either motion or rest with the durationless talov77s (156c-e), while in the Timaios he is contrasting Xp6vos as periodic form with the formlessness of random process. What the Demiurge creates in the Timaios is temporal form, not temporal spread. We must not con- fuse the two. Contrast, for example, Parm. i 5e, 7, 8, where r6b e at implies Xpbvov rv 7rap6vra, with Tm 37e-38b, where -r orTTvL implies a state to which Xp6vos does not apply. 3 Cf. 4Ie 5 and 42d 5: 6pyava Xp6vov, 6p-yava xp6ovU of moon and other stars. 4 39d: Xpbvwv 6vra rhi rorsTWV arXvas.

The theme of the Timaios is this informing of formless change by the Demiurge. If this dominating idea were false, the Timaios would be not only mythology, but nonsense as well. Yet how conceive of y'veoot' which lacks being altogether ? The more y/eveaL is denuded of stable oo-t'a, the more it will be true that it is Y4VEo-v": I'o-rt Y'EVeo-t, which sounds like a contradiction in terms. This is the deep-lying difficulty that is mirrored in the problem of pre- temporal motion. Plato could not have been entirely unaware of it. In the Sophist he faced squarely an analogous logical difficulty, and showed that o"rTL u q O v involves no contradiction. But the metaphysical problem he never cleared up in the same way.2 And it is doubtful if he could, without recasting his whole philosophy to end the ontological dichotomy of b ov det, y~evcrw SE" oVK Xov from 7T YVLyYEVOV piV dCE, ov 8E oV08'rro3E (27d-28a). Short of such a drastic remedy Plato had to compromise and say: the chaos is disorderly, but not altogether so; it contains 'some traces ' of order. This is a makeshift. Even as a metaphor it is self-contradictory, for 'traces' could only be a result, not an anticipation. Yet it is the best that Plato could do in the case of spatial order. And, I submit, it is the best he can do in the case of temporal order. He would have to say : Just as the pre-existing chaos had traces of geometric pattern, so it had traces of arithmetic periodicity; just as these traces justify us in speaking of ;ypatvop.evqv and rvpovypvEv before the formal creation of water and fire, so they might permit us to speak of a vague, indefinite priority and succession in the temporal passage which is as yet destitute of chronological order. This is, of course, a most unsatisfactory expedient. But the cause of the trouble, I repeat, is not the disorderly motion as such. It is the idea of yvwo-rts. eo-rtg, it now turns out, is not the protean state which Plato believes it to be, formless till it be ' likened' to the model by the charitable intervention of the Demiurge. On the contrary, quite apart from any order impressed upon it by the Creator, it has a precise, inalienable order of its own: an order of before and after, inherent in the mere fact of passage. I do not see how Plato could face this difficulty with- out rewriting not only the part of the Timaios which deals with the disorderly motion, but much more of the Timaios, and a good many parts of other dialogues as well. IV. We have the final perplexity: According to the well-known teaching of Laws x, all motion is caused by soul. The disorderly motion would then imply an irrational world-soul. But no such soul is mentioned in the Timaios. Since this is offered as an argument against the pre-existent chaos, a fair way of meet- 1 This idea is not peculiar to the Timaios. E.g.

(Brochard et Dauriac, Le Devenir dans la Philo- sophie de Platon, Cong. Int. de Phil., 1902.) This is hardly the place to argue the matter out. But his assumption that the Kotvwvia of Being, Same, Other, Motion, and Rest in the Sophist covers the relation of forms to material things is effectively answered in Cornford's Plato's Theory of Knowledge, p. 297. Robin's thesis that ]a distinction de I'intelligible et du sensible se fonde sur la puret6 ou l'exactitude plus ou moins grandes des relations qui les constituent, et que ce n'est, par cons6quent, qu'une diff6rence de degr6' (La Physique de Platon, Rev. Phil., Vol. 86, 1918, second half, p. 398), is attractive, but, I think, much too Leibnizian an interpretation of Plato. The difficulty with it appears in such a harmless little phrase as ' a la complexit6 infinies et perp6tuellement instables' (p. 410), which Robin uses to describe sensible things. Why 'instables'? Does mere increase of complexity cause instability ? Why should it ? To estab- lish his thesis Robin should be able to explain how Plato's doctrine of process can be reduced to a doctrine of increasing complexity of formal relations. 3 53b 2: v -r . . .ra.</page><page sequence="8">78 GREGORY VLASTOS ing it is to ask: Just what does it mean for the contrary hypothesis (i.e. that chaos is only the residual disorder ever present in the world) ? Professor Cornford answers : 'Since no bodily changes can occur without the self-motion of the soul, the other factor present in this chaos must be irrational motions of the World Soul, zonsidered in abstraction from the ordered revolutions of Reason. The dis- orderly moving mass must be conceived as animated by soul not yet reduced to order, but in a condition analogous in some ways to that of the infant soul described above (43a ff.).' (Plato's Cosmology, p. 205.) Yet- (a) Of' irrational motions of the World Soul' we know nothing in the Timaios. On the contrary, we are told at its creation: Odav &amp;pX'v ?pgawro 7dravrTrov KaL E4povog Blov rpbs 7bV oi4bavrava Xpvov (36e). (b) The analogy with the infant-soul, apposite as it is,1 is unfortunate for Professor Cornford's hypothesis: It does not tell us how an irrational soul originates irrational motions, but how irrational motions throw out of order the infant's soul. There is nothing the matter with the rationality of its soul. The trouble is with the 'flowing and ebbing tide of the body' (43a, Cornford's translation), and the violent motions that break upon it from the outside '. As Professor Cornford himself com- ments on this passage: ' Contrast the World Soul, which, as soon as it was joined with its body, began an " intelligent life " (36e), not being exposed to external assaults' (Op. cit., 149, n. 5). That is surely the difference. There are no external assaults to throw the motions of the world soul out of gear.3 And, unlike the infant, it is free from the six 'wandering motions." What else could induce disorder upon it? The only other possible factor mentioned in the Timaios is bad breeding (86e), which, of course, would be absurd for the world soul. More important than any specific conclusions that we might draw from this argument is the general way in which we put the problem when we look at it through the eyes of the Timaios. We have just been asking, What induces disorder in the soul ? But how ask this if you assume that all motion is caused by soul ? It is strictly meaningless for you, except in so far as it might suggest that disorder in one soul might be explained through disorder in some other soul. Any other kind of disorder would be irrelevant; for, on this hypothesis, there is no disorder not caused by soul. I do not see how anyone can make head or tail of the Timaios on this assumption. For instead of tracing back all chaos to some spiritual source, the Timaios invariably assumes the opposite. This apparent contrast between Laws x and the Timaios is striking, but not inexplicable. It derives from the totally different basic problems to which the two treatises are severally addressed: Laws x is simply and purely an exercise in apologetics. It must establish the existence of the gods. It does not raise any issue which will not assist in the proof of this conclusion, so urgent for religion, so essential for the State. The argument turns on one question: Is soul prior to body ? This question too is stripped to fight- ing-weight. It is not encumbered with the additional problem: What kind of soul-good or bad ? Experience can decide this.5 Only when he has proved to his 1 The drdKrWS KaiL aX6-yS Of the infant's dis- order reminds one most forcefully of wrXnrageXis Kac arKTrWS (3oa) and aXb-yw Kal d Terpc7 (53a) of the world-chaos. 2Note the force of T&amp; rd7iv 7rpoortrr6PrwP 7raO?'zara (43b), ruvpL 7rpooKpoKfoLE oer a . .. t&amp;Lh 70to a-daro al KLvPCElS 7rl 7rlv UbvXP 4eptLevatc 7rporr rTOLErv (43c), . . ?

Even there his object is not to explain the origin of evil, but to pro- vide religious comfort for the troubled soul, through the assurance of the universal plan in which all things work together for good.1 Individual souls have in them 'a cause of change' (904c); but this operates only within the framework of the universal plan already assumed. It explains the just punishment of injustice, not the occurrence of injustice itself. The ominous words KaT- 1a%-v '-~js eappvr~s ra~rv KaL vopov do slip in (9o4c). But what is this elpappivr ? Is it the will of the 'king ' or its limiting condi- tion ? The question is not raised in the Laws. But the Timaios cannot avoid it. The Timaios is no manual of political theology. It is ' esoteric' philosophy: the private discourse of like-minded philosophers (2oa), so much more leisurely and tenta- tive than the defensive vehemence of Laws x. It can thus open up the really tough questions of theodicy, without fear of unsettling the faith of the simple or exposing vulnerable flanks to atheistic opponents. It comes soon to the creation of the soul, which the Laws had assumed,2 but prudently refrained from presenting as a problem. To us, with our Hebrew-Christian heritage, the doctrine of creation suggests at once the doctrine of the fall. But Plato is just as much a scientific, as a religious, thinker. He stands in a line of physiological psychologists, who have discovered that elementary cognition involves physical contact with the material world. So two difficulties must be solved at once: (a) How the creature of a perfect creator is so imperfect; and (b) how an immaterial soul can be affected by material things in sensation. Plato's solution is that the soul does not consist of material particles, but oi a pattern of motion.3 It can move, and it can be moved. Because it can be moved it is subject to sensation, desire, pleasure and pain, and passions of every sort.4 And for the same reason it is prone to disease and disorder.5 Thus the cause of evil is disorderly motion. To exculpate God of responsibility for evil it is no longer disorder implies an evil soul, consider the ouranos and decide: Does it suggest the best soul or its contrary?' Therefore, it is a mistake to quote any part of this passage in support of the view that Plato believed in an evil world-soul. i rpod rnv oawr7plaV KaiL pEr7r i701o Xov iravr' Arl- rvuwrercayidvau (9o3b ff.).

When you find a physical cause for irrational choice,' you must exculpate God of the disorderly motion that has caused it. And you cannot stop short of the primitive chaos. This ultimate cause of evil must exist, uncaused by God, and (short of reopening the problem all over again) uncaused by soul. That is why we may dispense with Plutarch's well-meaning hypothesis of the primordial evil soul.2 Apart from his forced interpretation of Laws 896d,3 Plutarch's mainstay is the myth of the Politikos. Now when we examine the context of his quotations, it becomes plain that the cause of the ' counter-revolution ' in the myth is not soul, but body: T. ...

So far from substantiating Plutarch's hypothesis, the myth of the Politikos corroborates the doctrine of the Timaios and the Phaidon that the soul's partnership with the body is the source of its aberrations ;7 though its chief value for an account of the origin of evil is the explicit way in which it traces it all back to the primitive disorder : rap&amp; 8 r?s rT- 'poorv 0 ,E'es, 6o-a XaEr' Ka'i lKa~a &amp; ollpav ylyviErat, TCtVra E$ EKEtV-JS a3 al-TRs E (sc. 0 oi0pcvo's) EXEL Kalt 70L5 T ?ts E'varrpy&amp;SEaat (273c).

It mentions circumstances in the creation of the soul which account for its susceptibility to irrational motion: the 8(VS'IELKTros Other, and the rept r o-wJaTa yLyvo/fV?/ .. ovro-a, 35a. Motion is inherent in this yyvoO~vq oito-la which is one of the soul's ingredients. One could hardly attribute the origin of this motion to soul without circularity. On the contrary, the Timaios' mechanical explanation of all motion makes it quite unnecessary to postulate a bad soul to set the primitive chaos in motion": KvlLv SE EtS aV/tLXaT?)Ta aE TLOW^EV (57e).8 Chaos 1 E.g. in 86c, d, where we are given a definite physiological cause for heX av dKalptoS. 2 In de animae procreatione in Timaeo. 3 This is presumably the reference of &amp;, U ToZis N6ots L Kiv-rtxpus IvXiv draTKrov lEtpq7K KLLi KQiKO- 7rot6v, ibid, 1oI4e.

Plutarch himself puts no stock on eiap4Lv-q but refers to it as d(Vi'K77. Clearly elzappivu in Polit. 272e cannot be the will of the ' captain ', for he has just let go of the helm ; it is the disorder he had kept under control which is now asserting itself. That the realm of secondary causes includes a necessary element of disorder when separated from the overlord- ship of nous is clear from Tm 46e 5. 0 The same applies to 273b i, 2 : the ' instruc- tion' was not given to a primitive bad soul, but to the god-made soul that marked the end of chaos and the beginning of cosmos. 7 For the Timaios see above, nn. 4 and 5, P. 9. For the Phaidon see especially 66a-d. The soul of the philosopher must be 'released' from the Sfetters' of the body (67d; cf. Rep. 515c); it must be ' purified' from the 'contamination' of the body (Phaid. 67c 5 and Tm 69d 6; cf. Symp. 21re I, 2 and Rep. 6IIc 3). The body is a tomb' (Phaidr. 250c; Gorg. 493a). 8 Cornford comments in a footnote: 'Ob- viously the mover cannot be the soul, which belongs to a higher order of existence. It could not be spoken of as either heterogeneous and un- equal, or homogeneous and equal, with the moved.' Ot. cit., p. 240. Cf. also 58c 2-4 and 57a 2-4.</page><page sequence="11">THE DISORDERLY MOTION IN THE TIMAIOS 81 contains, by definition, the minimum of joa'rs, lopo-rs.x It must, therefore, and for purely mechanical reasons, be in constant motion." When the creator steps in to reduce the indefinite heterogeneity of the chaos to the definite homogeneity of the five regular polygons, the question arises whether we may not get too much likeness, in which case motion would cease altogether. The Demiurge solves this neatly by making the sizes of the atomic triangles infinitely various (57d). Thus he never has to think of starting motion, but only to keep it going. Likewise, when he creates the 'body' of the universe: there is no question of pushing it off to a start, but only of subtracting from it the six 'wandering' motions.3 Is it then possible to reconcile this teaching of the Timaios with Laws x? Remembering the special limitations of the task to which Laws x is devoted, we need not find that its teaching, taken as a whole, contradicts the cosmology of the Timaios. The crucial tenet of Laws x, the priority of soul over all material motions, is not strange to the Timaios: 34b, c. Yet once Timaios has given it fulsome acknowledgement, he makes no specific use of it. Because the soul is ' older', the soul must 'rule'. Chronological priority is hardly more than a vindication of ontological priority, in line with a deep-rooted ethical and political dogma that the older must rule the younger.4 To press it further would be embarrassing in view of the Timaios' doctrine of time. Why then does Laws x make so much of this very temporal priority which seems hardly more than a pious formality in the Timaios ? Precisely because it has been contradicted by the atheistic materialists. It is they who make, alas, only too good sense of the temporal priority of matter. To refute them Plato must meet them on their own ground. And so he does, retaining the ambiguity of dpXy and apxe,65 and arguing its cosmic primogeniture." In the course of this argument he propounds the bare possibility that primary causation might rest with the evil soul. But this is forthwith declared to be contrary to fact, and the speaker can go on to complete the case against the atheists, without digressing to explain how primary causation through the evil soul is, in fact, inexplicable save through collision with material, secondary causes. That is why Aristotle, years later, writes that Plato ' sometimes' declares the soul the arche of motion (Met. Io7Ia I). The expression is a compromise between the apparent contradiction of Laws x and the Timaios; a con- tradiction which he must hold to be only apparent, else he would not have scrupled to make capital out of it in his usual polemic. On this interpretation the proposition that the soul is 7rpi;ov yevroTEWS Kat 0Oopa amrtov (Laws 891e) merely denotes the supremacy of the soul's teleological action within the created universe. Its polemic resources are fully exploited in Laws x. But it is not offered as a substitute for the cosmologic teaching of the Timaios. Only here, where Plato gives us a complete picture of the relations of teleology to mechanism, can we find an intelligible meaning of the ' firstness' of the soul: Soul 1 Cf. the phrase of Pol. 273d, e -rb rvrs dvo- upotorfros dretpov dvra 7r6vrov to which the world would revert if it persisted in its 'counter-revo- lution.' 2 This is not in contradiction with Phaidr. 245d, e rrvra re obpavbiv urava re y7v els &amp; ovp- reoocav apTqvaL.

The 'worse' motions are externally impressed ; the 'best' are self-initiated (89a). Soul is inherently of the 'best'; though it is not immune from assaults by the 'worse'. This is a serious qualification of the apparent meaning of the doctrine that soul is iPXy KLvWTEOS (Laws 896b; Phaidros 245c).1 Are we mutilating the Laws to force conformity with the Timaios ? I think not. We are merely to make sense of the state- ment taken by itself. Forget the Timaios altogether for the moment. How much could Plato mean when he says that the soul is the cause of all becoming and perishing ? At its face-value this asserts that the soul is itself the cause of the instability of becoming; that apart from soul reality would be untroubled by transience.2 But this is grotesquely unPlatonic. When Plato does ask himself, ' Is soul more akin to being or becoming ?', he can only answer,' It is in every way more like being' (Phaidon 79e). The one thing he cannot mean in the Laws is that soul is the source of Heracleitean flux. h'cvrts must be presupposed. It must be 'there', before soul can supervene to 'rule' it. But if is 'there', it must involve motion of some sort; not teleological motion in the absence of soul, but disorderly mechanical motion.3 Thus, quite independently of the description of the disorderly motion in the Timaios, we should be forced to supply something like it in order to make sense of the doctrine of Laws x that soul is the first cause of becoming. Does this clear up all the difficulties of the disorderly motion ? Hardly. How does the Demiurge act upon the disorderly motion ?4 Indeed how does any ' firs*' cause act upon a 'second' one? Aristotle's complaint that Plato gives no explanation of the soul's KOLvovWL with the body it inhabits (de An. 407b 12-19) can be pushed further: How is it that material impact upon the soul can and does take place,5 even though the soul is not a material body ? And, conversely, how is it that the immaterial soul acts and ' masters' the discordant motions of the body ? How does one pattern of motion act upon another pattern of motion, though one is composed of material particles and the other is not ? It is no accident that Plato has avoided such questions. They point to deep- I am leaving out of this discussion the additional complication that in the Phaidros the idea of the soul as APXyi Kal 7rfy? KL vW0es serves at once to prove that the soul is ungenerated: el' y&amp;p TK TOU tPXl yLyvoLTre, OtK AVlY TL 4"pX) ylyVOLTO (245d). In the Laws the meaning of the premiss must have changed, else the conclusion could not have been contradicted, as it is in the fre- quent references of the Laws to the soul as generated (see above, n. 2, p. 79). 'ApXh is a 'weasel-word' in Plato. It may mean any, or all, of (i) beginning, (ii) source, (iii) cause, (iv) ruling principle, (v) ruling power. It should be noted that the mythological interptetation of the pre-existing chaos and of its associated doctrine of creation could take the chronological ' firstness' of the soul no more literally; cf. Plutarch: el y&amp;p dniyljVros0 K6aTros arTvi, oftXrcu T7 InXdwt Tr 7 6rpeTrL6yrepov To 700 ebLTaroQ s vI pvXv oQiapO dtipXewV /eraTlOXjfS Kal KLYhOEWs 7rdo77)f. de an. proc. in Tim. 1013 f. 2 Note that the hypothesis of the universal standstill (Laws 895a, b), against which Plato's argument of the soul as first mover is so effective, is enemy territory. It was they (ol 7rXeiTrot Trwv rOLo6TWo1), not Plato, who ' dare' affirm it. Like- wise in the Phaidros the supposition of all motion of heaven and earth coming to an absolute stop is the apodosis of a per impossibile hypothesis. 3 We must never forget that Plato thinks of mechanism as disorderly, except in so far as it is teleologically ordered: e.g. Tm 46e, where the 'second' causes, unmistakably identified with mechanical causes in 46e I, 2, are said to be 6sat /ovw8eLCeac &lt;povy7Tews To TUXdY KcifcTOTE e epTr- orvrat. That mechanism nevertheless does contain an order of its own is part of the con- tradiction in Plato's thinking noted above, p. 77. 4 An easy solution is to animate the chaos; then the Demiurge would only need to 'per- suade' its bad soul, and this would seem to make better sense of such expressions as 48a 2, 4, or 56c 5. But this is only postponing the difficulty. If the Demiurge persuades the evil soul, the reformed soul would then have to persuade its disorderly body-and the difficulty turns up again. At some point final cause must meet efficient cause. To insert intermediary souls only puts off the inevitable encounter of soul with body. 5 See above, nn. 2 and 3, P. 78. 6 Tm 42b 2.</page><page sequence="13">THE DISORDERLY MOTION IN THE TIMAIOS 83 lying difficulties or, at least, obscurities in his categories of material reality. But their further discussion lies beyond the limits of this paper.
