Strange this tutelary prox- imity between the divine and the demonic when one might expect all of the antagonism of opposing forces. Nowhere are these demonic figures more richly rendered than in the Chinese popular novel of the late Ming dynasty, The Journey to the West; for in its comically subtle telling of a Bud- dhist monk's pilgrimage to India in the company of his four transgressive guardians, one begins to unravel the conundrum of why demons, at once so dangerous and impure, are so often required by the pure.' This, how- ever, is just the beginning, for, as we traverse the trail of demonic dis- ruption, we begin to view the world through the eyes of the demon, an unnerving perspective as it shifts one's frame of reference from one struc- Laurie Cozad is a doctoral candidate in the History of Religions Program at the University of Chicago Divinity School, Chicago, IL 60637. 1 All citations are taken from Anthony C.

And having orchestrated this shift in perspective to reveal the alternative structure embodied by this categorical other, the author of The Journey to the West concretely displays the way in which this figure can be used to usher in a particular religio/ethical alter- native: the late Ming re-valorization of Ch'an. Thus, in exploring The Jour- ney to the West one is presented not only with a fascinating slice of Chinese religious history but, more importantly, with a marvelous example of the way in which a text attempts to subvert order as demonic characters are used to explore, test, and manipulate the religious structures that impose order. PREPARING FOR THE JOURNEY The Chinese epic The Journey to the West is based on an actual seventh- century pilgrimage to India by the monk Hsuan Tsang who travelled for seventeen years in order to acquire Mahayana Buddhist scriptures. As one of the most famous pilgrimages in Chinese religious history, the original story has been retold many times and in many forms including the historical Hsuan Tsang's Record of Western Territories, a plethora of popu- lar versions within the oral realm, a poetic tale, a ninth or tenth-century pictorial account, several dramatic versions, and finally the 100-chapter novel purportedly by Ming author Wu Ch'eng-en about which Anthony Yu writes the following: "Invention, in fact, is the most immediate dis- tinguishing feature of the 100-chapter work when one compares it with either its antecedents or the accounts of the historical pilgrim" (1983: 216). As a work of popular fiction, The Journey to the West can be seen both to serve and to reflect popular interests. Chinese popular religious culture from the Sung dynasty forward includes not only elements of the three religions of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism, but according to Maspero as cited by Overmyer, "popular religion was a system in its own right, quite different from the older 'three religions,' despite its syn- cretism. In this system Buddhist monks and Taoist priests both had the role of 'sorcerers,' the Buddhists with more concern for the role of the dead, the Taoists for delivering the living from evil forces" (Overmyer: 155). Clearly, "evil beings abound" (Maspero: 126), and as such, it is no surprise that a panoply of demonic figures-spawned from this multi- plicity of religious structures-found its way into vernacular literature. Furthermore, as the recitation of Buddhist sutras had long been regarded as an efficacious process for dispelling demonic forces, a novel such as The Journey to the West, which both encapsulates these sutras and valorizes this process, would have served an important role in the extension of reli-</page><page sequence="3">Cozad: Reeling in the Demon 119 gious practices into daily life (Bantly: 522). Daniel Overmyer writes: "Ver- nacular literature was both influenced by popular religion, and became a source of myths and deities for later religious developments. In both its oral and written forms it was very much a part of the life of the people, and to a large extent an expression of their culture" (173). To illuminate the primary way in which the forces of good and evil were understood in pre-Ming China, it is instructive to turn to the words of the eleventh-century Neo-Confucian author Ch'eng Hao: "The good- ness and evil of the world are both equally Heavenly Principle. To say that something is evil does not mean that it is inherently so. It is merely because it goes too far or does not go far enough" (Overmyer:157). Two points can be gleaned from this passage. First, this Neo-Confucian scholar can be seen to prefigure the work of such modern-day structuralists as Saussure and Levi-Strauss, as an application of good versus evil is made according to an object's degree of deviance or conformity to a particular category within a classificatory structure. Second, Ch'eng Hao points out that in contrast to a western worldview in which an attempt is made to banish evil, the Chinese worldview maintains a sense of inclusivity in which good and evil are seen to exist side by side. Andrew Plaks describes this universe as one "with neither beginning nor end, neither eschato- logical nor teleological purpose, within which all of the conceivable oppo- sites of sensory and intellectual experience are contained, such that the poles of duality emerge as complementary within the intelligibility of the whole" (1977:168). From this perspective those rich embodiments of purity and impurity, namely, gods and demons, while differentiated on the basis of "correctness," are perceived as necessary correlatives within a single cosmogonic system. Contrary to Plaks's assertion, however, one must always be suspicious of any easy reference to a "whole" on either the ideological or methodological level. For more often than not such a depic- tion of inclusive "wholeness" represents an imposed virtual reality that disguises the existence of underlying alternative classificatory structures, alternative systems that can be understood as competing spheres of sig- nification.2 This issue is of primary importance, as much of the intrigue and longevity of this novel resides in the fact that it constantly mani- pulates and subverts this concept of wholeness as it explicitly portrays the demonic as that which is incorrect when related to a particular religious/ ethical norm. 2 Following Bernard Faure, I am using the term 'structure' "in the Turnerian sense" (Faure 1991: 90). As such, "both 'official' and 'popular' religions constitute 'structures"' (Faure 1991: 90). While Faure makes no further elaboration, my use of this term stems from the following words by Turner that point to a religious structure as a "system which itself constitutes an explanation of the universe and guarantees the norms and values on which orderly social arrangements rest" ( 356).</page><page sequence="4">120 Journal of the American Academy of Religion As religious pluralism has a long tradition within Chinese reli- gious history, it is no surprise that one finds in The Journey to the West a blending of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. However, while the novel clearly valorizes the syncretic "unity of the Three Religions (San- chiao kuei-i)" (Yu 1977: 38), this unity is rarely sustained, as contrast- ing thematic elements tend to vie for dominance in an ever-shifting reli- gious mosaic. The Journey to the West thus operates much in the manner of a doctrinal kaleidoscope as the narrative modulates through Taoist al- chemical treatises punctuated by comical references to Confucian sensi- bilities overlaid with Buddhist sectarian arguments, all revolving around the capricious design of Ch'an. Given this "intricate network of religious significance" (Yu 1987: 120), it stands to reason that the content embodied by the demonized other will shift in accordance with the patterning of the religious norm. The grid that undergirds this demonic dynamic can be formulated in the following manner: As stated, the demonic can best be understood as a category imposed on that which is other in relation to a religious/ethical norm. However, the way in which the demonic functions will be dependent upon its derivation. In other words, if the content of the demon is derivative of a particular religious structure, the demon will embody the transgressive elements of that structure. As such, this locus of transgressive elements will function in two ways: first, to highlight the prescriptive tenets of that particular structure, and, second, to provide the means by which these tenets might be carried out. Clearly, then, these endogenous transgressive figures function to reinforce the singular wholeness of a religious struc- ture as they are forever juxtaposed to the pure within an all-inclusive com- plementary opposition. In contrast to these derived/endogenous figures are those demonized others which are depicted as non-derived or exo- genous in terms of a particular religious structure. Surely transgressive, for they embody the alternative values of an alternative structure, they are either exorcised from the dominant structure or conscripted into that structure as tutelary deities. I will characterize these conscripted tutelary figures as exogenous mediators, as they navigate between a dominant structure and a particularized alternative. As such, when reeled into the dominant structure, these exogenous mediators can work to reinforce that structure in a variety of ways that will be elaborated in the following sec- tions, or they can subvert that structure from the inside as they display the relative nature of the dominant structure along with the individualized merits of a religio/ethical alternative. As the above grid would indicate, the narrative framework of The Journey to the West works to produce, to refine, to relativize, and to ma- nipulate religious structures by introducing, in serial fashion, demonic</page><page sequence="5">Cozad: Reeling in the Demon 121 antagonists with which the characters who embody and advance a par- ticular structure must grapple, modifying that structure as they do so. Briefly then, we have our Mahayana Buddhist monk, Hsuan Tsang, travel- ling to India in the company of four exogenous demons conscripted as tutelary deities: Monkey, Pigsy, Sha Monk, and the Dragon Horse. The most important of these is Monkey or Pilgrim Sun, an exogenous medi- ator clearly derived from the Ch'an tradition of trickster figures, who con- tinuously subverts the dominant structure from the inside by emerging from his repressed tutelary role to embody and to advance the alternative structure of Ch'an. Further along the route we encounter a whole slew of exogenous demons such as Red Boy and the Black Bear Monster, who in the same manner as Monkey disrupt the centrality of the dominant struc- ture and thus must be shanghaied into the celestial bureaucracy to serve as tutelary deities. In addition, the pilgrims confront endogenous demons such as the Green Buffalo monster-a former heavenly denizen who has rejected his post-as well as a full contingent of little endogenous demons who, having derived from the dominant structure, function unilaterally in support of that structure. FIRST STOP: SERVING THE STRUCTURE This brings us to our first stop on the demon trail, namely, to "those 'little ones' or 'lesser demons' (hsiao-te men, hsiao-yao) who constitute the household servants and armies of more important and powerful demons (yao-mo, mo-t'ou). They are animals who have cultivated themselves to the point of possessing a few powers" (Campany: 100) and are, in fact, "all donkeys, asses, cows, stallions, badgers, foxes, musk deer, goats, tigers, antelopes, and the like" (3:179). Thus, moving from the level of structure to the level of content in order to analyze these transgressive figures, the dominant religio/ethical structure that works to classify and to categorize this particular pattern springs from San-chiao-the syncretic blending of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. These little demons embody all of the transgressive elements that can be derived from this syncretic tradi- tion: self-promotion versus social welfare, obedience towards a transgres- sive master, a concern with worldly goods, and an indulgence in trans- formative tricks stemming from heterodox alchemical practices. It is interesting to explore the way in which heterodoxy is recognized within a structure of religious syncretism: "Syncretism, as opposed to eclecticism, assumes a firm basis of religious authority. It is not simply a random jux- taposition of elements into an idiosyncratic whole, but the incorporation of various elements in a home tradition. Most commonly syncretism is an enrichment and reinterpretation of the syncretist's lifelong religion,</page><page sequence="6">122 Journal of the American Academy of Religion building on traditional forms of authority to verify the orthodoxy of the new vision. ... The notion of internal orthodoxy helps explain why syn- cretists often vehemently attack heresy and errors. The psychology is that of a boundary situation; there is an inherent tension, a threat of disloyalty, when tradition is being reformed or redefined" (Berling: 11). These little demons are most helpful with this process of defining boundaries and ensuring differentiation, as they function to highlight that which is orthodox by indulging in the heterodox. One of their primary transformative tricks is to take on a human appearance for the purpose of fooling the pilgrims in order to obtain the monk, a particularly tasty monk for he "is actually the incarnation of the Gold Cicada, and he has the original body which has gone through the process of self-cultivation during ten previous existences. If a man [or a demon for that matter] eats a piece of his flesh, his age will be immeasurably lengthened" (2:19; brack- ets mine). Beyond highlighting what is prescribed within this structure as they embody what is transgressive, these little demons also function as the means by which the pilgrims might act out these prescriptions-first, as Fran Bantly has noted, because they occasion the possibility for expia- tory suffering, and, second, as they provide the necessary opportunity by which the pilgrims achieve merit in pursuit of the "right fruit" (4:385). First, in terms of expiatory suffering, Monkey is so often called upon to protect Hsuan Tsang from the clutches of demonic beasts and fiendish monsters that he finally throws up his hands lamenting: "Oh, Master! In which incarnation did you incur such ordeals of bondage, that you must in this life face monster-spirits every step of the way! It's so hard now to rid you of your sufferings. What shall we do?" (3:254). This, however, is all part of the plan as the pilgrims are forced to tangle with these demons in order to redeem themselves from previous karmic infractions that range from the monk's having "slighted the law" in a former incarnation to Monkey's riotous disruption of the Peach Festival (4:90). In fact, "the exactions of retributive law are so precise and inexorable that the amount of compulsory suffering has been computed to exactly eighty-one or- deals" (Bantly: 518). In this respect the little demons have been cast in the role of preordained "extras" toward the goal of the pilgrims' spiritual atonement. Second, in terms of merit-making, the little demons are useful to the pilgrims precisely because they have not yet attained the "way of hu- manity" and can therefore be wiped-out in good conscience (3: 184). The Bodhisattva Kuan-Yin relates that "the bandits are no good, to be sure, but they are, after all, human beings and they don't deserve such punishment. They are not like those fiendish fowls or monstrous beasts, those demons or griffins. If you kill or slaughter those things, it's your merit" (3: 105);</page><page sequence="7">Cozad: Reeling in the Demon 123 implied is the fact that their slaughter bequeaths a benefit to the world as a whole. Anthony Yu points out in his introduction to The Journey that it is precisely because the "purging of imps and fiends" (3:206) is both "socially beneficent" and "achieved through mutual dependence and communal effort" that it is moved into the realm of a merit-making ac- tivity (1:62). Furthermore, created in support of a spiritual journey in which the action "is actually localized and internalized" (Yu 1983: 226), these little demons provide the means by which the pilgrims' progress might be visu- alized by the audience. In other words, they function as narrative vehicles within "an allegory of philosophical and alchemical self-cultivation" (Yu 1983: 216). Understood as Mara hindrances, the little demons are them- selves allegorical, as they are made to represent both the illusory distur- bances of a too-active mind as well as the little slips and peccadillos of the alchemical adept. Clearly then, the novel portrays these little endogenous demons as a cluster of attributes and practices that are incorrect according to the tenets of San-chiao. Depicted as such, their destruction is understood as a constructive and prescribed activity. It should be noted, however, that the "purging of imps and fiends" serves a further purpose; for not only is the world rid of a perceived noxious presence but also in death these demons are restored to their original animal form, thus restoring the dominant classificatory structure to its original order. This is a crucial point, for these creatures are not demonic as animals but become demonic in their ability to transform through their misuse of Taoist alchemical practices. Or in the words of Mary Douglas, it is in their ability to confound "the general scheme of the world" that they are perceived to be demonic (151). Given the fact that their ability to transform themselves and thus elude classification forms the basis of their demonhood, it is crucial to penetrate their disguise in order to reel them back into their proper place within this religious structure. Rob Campany writes: "This concern with the naming and taxonomy of demons pervades not only The Journey but much of Taoist, Buddhist, and popular lore as well.... Likewise, in esoteric reli- gious Taoism there is a long tradition of exorcising demons and control- ling spirits by techniques involving the visualization of their physical appearances and the recital of their true names, complete knowledge of which is a guarded secret" (97n.4). In terms of the little demons, it is precisely in bringing about their death that their original form is restored: "When they went inside, all the little fiends were in the process of packing and fleeing, having learned already that the old fiend had been captured. When Pilgrim ran into them he struck them down one by one until some seven hundred of them were</page><page sequence="8">124 Journal of the American Academy of Religion slain. As they revealed their original forms, they were all spirits of moun- tains and trees, the monsters of beasts and fowl" (3:270). Within this model killing is shown as one technique for restoring a creature to its "original form," a stable referent, if you will, which then allows for its cor- rect classification. Knowledge of a creature's "source" that places primary emphasis on a "true" form is a crucial motif within both Buddhism and Taoism (Company: 98). Furthermore, this notion pervades Confucianism as well through the well-known doctrine of cheng ming, the rectification of names, in which the determination of a "true" form leads to the objec- tive divisibility of one thing from another, thus allowing for the correct assignment of a proper place within a classificatory structure. I would point out, however, that the relative ease with which these lit- tle demons are dispatched to their correct classificatory niche within this religious structure is directly related to the fact that they are derived from this structure. In other words, as endogenous to the structure, they are easily contained, as they have a proper place to which they can be re-stored. Thus, having carried-out the transgressive function for which they were created, these creatures are restored to their proper place, as that which was impure is restored to purity. This point is emphasized by the story of Lao Tzu's green buffalo: a good cosmic underling gone bad who has been lured away from his ce- lestial post by the prospect of worldly goods and spiritual advance- ment through heterodoxy. Therefore, travelling during the winter during which- The piercing cold wind wafted a rare scent, But snow hid the place where plum flowers bloomed, (2:406) Monkey is forced to go in search of food while Pigsy and Sha Monk decide to avail themselves of some warm vests found in an abandoned building. However, "that towered building, you see, had been devised by a monster-spirit, who had spent the days ensnaring people at the place" (2:406). Summarily snatching up the Monk, Pigsy, Sha Monk, and the Dragon Horse, the fiend realizes that he has happened upon quite a find. "I have often heard," said the demon, chuckling, "that if anyone eats a piece of the T'ang monk's flesh, his white hair will turn black, and his fallen teeth will grow back once more. Today it is my good fortune that you have arrived without my beckoning" (2:411). Upon his return Monkey finds that the other pilgrims have been cap- tured by "the Great King One-Horn Buffalo, who has vast magic powers and who is most capable in the martial arts" (2:413). Monkey confronts the fiend but is quickly vanquished, as the first round of this bout goes to the buffalo. Monkey attributes his defeat to the fact that he "doesn't know</page><page sequence="9">Cozad: Reeling in the Demon 125 what sort of demon he [the buffalo] is or where he comes from" (3:2). He suspects, however, that this "lawless demon" (3:22) is one who descended from Heaven "to the Region Below out of longing for the world" (3:3). He therefore scours the heavens in order to determine the fiend's identity, for in so doing he will discover its proper place and master. After a prolonged search, Monkey discovers that the fiend is, in fact, Lao Tzu's green buffalo who has stolen a diamond fillet prior to making his escape to the Region Below. With Lao Tzu in tow he returns to confront the demon: "When the demon raised his head and saw that it was Lao Tzu, his heart shook and his gall quivered. 'This thievish ape,' he said, 'is truly a devil of the Earth! How did he manage to find my master?"' (3:34). Once found, however, the demon is at once mastered: "Reciting a spell Lao Tzu fanned the air once with his fan. The fiend threw the fillet at Lao Tzu, who caught it immediately and gave him another fan. All at once the fiend's strength fled him and his tendons turned numb; he changed back into his original form, which was that of a green buffalo" (3:34). The fate of the green buffalo thus confirms the previous discussion of cheng ming, as the identification of this demon's proper form allows for his proper classification and subsequent restoration within the cosmic hierarchy. Furthermore, depicted as one who originally derived from the cosmic hierarchy, despite his vast heterodox abilities, he is portrayed as a mere tourist in his departure from the ethical norm. As such, he is easily re-integrated into the hierarchical system through the act of correct con- textualization, as Lao Tzu-his direct superior-uses the stolen fillet "to pierce the nostrils of the fiend" (3:34). As portrayed in this example, the endogenous demon is nothing more than an insubordinate underling of a dominant structure. More important is the way in which the category of the "demonic" functions within this example: it is applied to those who would dare to leave their prescribed classificatory niche and thereby threaten the maintenance and integrity of the hierarchical structure, a hierarchical structure, moreover, that is perceived as "right" and "natural" as it has been made manifest through the vehicle of cheng ming. As portrayed then by the Green Buffalo, the endogenous demon-created to serve its struc- ture of origin-works to centralize the concepts of purity and impurity around the maintenance of established order. Functioning as such, these figures remain pure as they confine themselves to their proper classifi- catory niche and are impure as they depart from this niche. Thus, unlike their exogenous colleagues, an endogenous demon cannot be conscripted as a tutelary deity, because it is barred from entering that liminal space which requires its mediators to be both pure and impure at one and the same time. In fact, within the Chinese model as depicted within The</page><page sequence="10">126 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Journey it is only the exogenous demon who can take on the role of the tutelary deity, for once reeled into the dominant structure, this demon- ized other is gilded with the patina of structural respectability, while retaining all of the alternative and therefore transgressive elements of its origin.3 NEXT STOP: WORRYING THE STRUCTURE This brings us to our next stop along the demon trail, namely, to the way in which The Journey depicts those exogenous demonized figures who, as anterior to a dominant classificatory structure, possess the capac- ity either to support or to disrupt the established order of things. These figures represent the quintessential "Other"-"that which, for a given cul- ture, is at once interior and foreign" (Foucault: xxiv): interior, as they are present cultural forces with which one must contend; foreign, as they are embodied representatives of a competing ideology, which stands as the foundation of an alternative classificatory structure. Unlike their endoge- nous counterparts, these demonized outsiders are not merely a cluster of attributes and practices that are formulated in opposition to the pre- scriptions of the dominant structure and thereby support the inclusive wholeness of that structure. Rather, these figures embody the constructive elements of an alternative structure. While that structure is clearly trans- gressive, it is not merely transgressive, as it constructs the norm around such values as resourcefulness, daring, and individual attainment, and which the novel depicts as revealed and accessed from this locus of de- monic disruption. Thus, the possibility of irreducible otherness rears its unregenerate visage through a rogues' gallery of fiendish reprobates who have never once set foot within the celestial bureaucracy. Furthermore, the novel's presentation of these figures-beautiful yet transgressive, divine yet demonic-brilliantly highlights the fact that as anterior to the domi- nant structure, these figures straddle two distinct spheres of signification: that of the dominant structure and that of their structure of origin." 3 It should be noted that other religious structures, such as Hinduism, allow for the emergence of endogenous tutelary deities. Furthermore, these figures do not necessarily spring from the demonic but constitute a category unto themselves; an example is the figure of Ganesha, who physically por- trays his pure and impure nature as he possesses an anthropomorphic body with the head of an ele- phant. I would argue that the possibility of an endogenous tutelary deity in our theoretical grid would depend upon a variation in paradigmatic assumptions: while cheng ming decrees that objective refer- entiality be made immanent within the human realm, thus dictating the purity, permanence, and pre- cision of classificatory categories, the Indian model retains a certain fluidity as it projects a tran- scendent stabilizer in the form of a divine being (such as Siva, Visnu, or Devi) whose creative acts are perceived to transcend human order. 4 Such designations as fiend, reprobate, and, of course, demon, derive from the dominant struc- ture's system of signification and represent an attempt by those who control a dominant discourse to contain those figures who constitute a threat and, worse still, an alternative to established order.</page><page sequence="11">Cozad: Reeling in the Demon 127 Thus, as "Others" with a capital "O" these figures are involved in a multi-layered process of disruption: they destabilize the perceived cen- trality of the dominant structure, because they embody the reality that the demonized other, while liminal to the dominant structure, stands at the apex of its own alternative structure. However, while clearly possessing great subversive potential, these figures can also be a means of support for the dominant structure as their impure powers prove exceedingly handy to those on the interdictory side of the power line-handy because these impure characters can go places the pure can't go, do things the pure can't do, get things that the pure can't get, and generally be useful within all of those realms that are off-limits to their pristine counterparts. It is crucial to note, however, that these dangerous demonic outsiders are handy only as long as they can be contained within the dominant classificatory struc- ture, and this process of containment is hardly an easy task, for these exogenous figures cannot be "re-stored" to a pre-ordained niche as were their endogenous counterparts but must be captured and contained through a process of enforced integration. As is often the case when knowledge can be directly correlated with power, rules of secrecy have been established to keep certain Taoist meth- ods within the realm of esoteric knowledge; for just as gunpowder will work for either side, alchemical practices aimed at refining the inner essence of immortality (the cinnabar cult) could prove efficacious re- gardless of whose hands they fell into. As Monkey states, "All the creatures of this world who possess the nine apertures can become immortals through the cultivation of the Great Art" (1:359). In this regard, Taoism is the original "loose cannon" of canons. As the novel borrows heavily from the Tao Tsang as a primary element within the San-chiao mosaic, great pains are taken to warn of the potential penalties to be incurred through incorrect usage or the "side door" of heterodoxy. This is especially so as these demonized others demonstrate great vigor in their ability to leave the "main road" in order to find "another way" (3:174), a way that is por- trayed as dangerous and transgressive not only as it traffics in prohibited practices but, more importantly, transgressive as its primary emphasis is upon individual attainment without regard for the way in which San- chiao has constructed a conception of social/communal integration. As noted by Cristiano Grottanelli in his study of trickster figures, this mode of acquiring power "implies power through impurity, a type of power to- tally different from the established power of aristocrats, generals, and chiefs. It is the 'other' power, that often faces the power of those who make and uphold the rules, being the power of breaking rules and the liminal, as opposed to the central .. ." (138). It can be seen then that San-chiao places a primary emphasis on the concept of communal integration based on wu hsing or "a grid of five ele-</page><page sequence="12">128 Journal of the American Academy of Religion ments interaction" (Plaks 1987: 268), which Monkey discusses early in the novel: "Fully integrate the five elements and apply them backward and forward; when this is accomplished you can become a buddha or immortal at will" (1:20). The novel makes much of this principle, and the pilgrims-who are often explicitly associated with the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth-find either success or failure as a direct result of their ability to act as one. This integrative interdiction, however, is exactly that which these figures transgress as they ignore "a larger vision of totality" (1:61) for the express purpose of independent self-cultivation-an "incorrect," "heterodox" method, for it flaunts the possibility of any type of communal integration but especially that which is aimed at structuring a hierarchical cosmic order. A place within the hierarchical cosmic order, however, is exactly what these demonized out- siders eschew in order to pursue their own agenda within their own struc- ture of origin. One early tale chronicles the activities of the "godlike" Black Bear Monster, a great adept of this "'other' power" who lives in a "heavenly cave dwelling" far from the reaches of heaven (1:353, 356). As one who has never served within the celestial bureaucracy or paid heed to its laws, it is clear that the novel employs this figure subtly to highlight the relativity of classificatory structures. It thus presents a creature who is other yet equal, a "monster" but "godlike" whom Monkey describes as pursuing an alter- native path, but one of integrity: "This monster is one who withdraws from the dirt and the dust, one who knows his fate" (1:356). However, involved as he is with "how to establish the ting and the oven, how to knead the cinnabar and refine the mercury, the topics of white snow and yellow sprout-all esoteric doctrines of heterodox Tao- ism" (1:353,348), the Black Bear Monster is clearly one who deviates from the path of San-chiao; and having "stolen" the principles of Taoism for his own purposes, he now indulges in the treasures of Buddhism. Pursu- ing such, he sneaks into the monastery, where the pilgrims have stopped for the night, in order to purloin the monk's "brocaded robe of Buddha" (1:348). This blatant act of disruption is intercepted by Monkey who promises the monk that he "shall certainly capture this fellow and re- turn the garment" (1:354). This is easier said than done, as this monster "has attained the way of humanity through self-cultivation" and possesses "great magical power" (1:358, 361). But "the monster's magic skills, so rare on earth," are far too disruptive to allow (1:357). Thus, the action does not stop with the return of the robe, for it is the monster, not the robe, which must finally be claimed. Moreover, the Black Bear's conscription into the Bodhisattva's contingent is not pretty, for as he is anterior to the dominant structure, he cannot be "re-stored" but must be forcibly integrated: "The</page><page sequence="13">Cozad: Reeling in the Demon 129 monster fell to the floor, while the Bodhisattva revealed her true form and recovered the Buddha Robe from the monster. Pilgrim then left the mon- ster's body through his nose but fearing that the monster might still be truculent, the Bodhisattva threw a fillet on his head. As he arose, the mon- ster did indeed pick up his lance to thrust at Pilgrim. The Bodhisattva, however, rose into the air and began reciting her spell. The spell worked, and the monster felt excruciating pain on his head; throwing away the lance, he rolled wildly all over the ground. In midair, the Handsome Mon- key King nearly collapsed with laughter; down below the Black Bear Mon- ster almost rolled himself to death on the floor" (1:365). As the generator of an alternative structure, the powerful demon poses a real danger to the dominant structure's monopoly on truth, a point that the text underscores, as the process of the Black Bear's containment requires an explicit demonstration of his willingness to convert: "con- vinced by the unbearable pain, he had no choice but to fall on his knees and beg: 'Spare my life, for I'm willing to submit to Truth!'" (1:365). Thus, clearly it is through mastering that "'other' power, which often faces the power of those who make and uphold the rules" (Grottanelli: 138) that the dominant ideology provides itself with an opportunity not only to rid itself of a competing ideology-which may or may not have garnered a cohesive audience-but also to assert and further legitimate its own power and authority.5 So it was with the Black Bear. Today his vaulting ambition is checked; This time his boundless license has been curbed. (1:365) This is hardly the end of the Black Bear Monster, however, for having been contained, this beast's liminal powers can now be put to use within the dominant structure: "Fearing that too much effort would have been wasted, Pilgrim wanted to strike at once. Quickly stopping him, the Bo- dhisattva said, 'Don't hurt him; I have some use for him.' Pilgrim said, 'Why not destroy a monster like him, for of what use can he be?' 'There's no one guarding the rear of my Potalaka Mountain' said the Bodhisattva, 5 As the mere recognition of a competing ideology reveals the constructed/relative nature of the dominant ideology, there is great incentive to suppress alternative ideological contenders. Thus, unless a competing ideology has garnered such a large audience that it makes itself evident within the public domain, it will rarely be granted the status of "competing ideology" or "alternative structure." Furthermore, this discussion begs a broadening of Victor Turner's use of the term "structure"; for clearly I am arguing that an autonomous classificatory structure is generated by the alternative ideol- ogy of one whose particularity exceeds the dominant structure. In fact, the embodiment of an alter- native ideology--or the perception of one as embodying such-is precisely that which constitutes one as other to the dominant structure. Thus, whether recognized or unrecognized, whether em- braced by one or embraced by many, an alternative ideology constructs an autonomous classificatory structure that represents a potential alternative to established order.</page><page sequence="14">130 Journal of the American Academy of Religion 'and I want to take him back there to be a Great Mountain-Guardian God"' (1:365). Thus, the novel tracks the progress of the other from the role of demon to the role of tutelary deity, as the Bodhisattva, champion of Buddhism, co-opts the Black Bear's liminal powers to bridge that gap between her sacred space and the turbulent world below. And who could be better suited to such a task than an incorporated transgressor, an exogenous demon who, unlike his endogenous counterparts, retains his impurity as he is conscripted into the dominant structure? The power and potential of the demonized other is further elaborated in a pivotal story that involves the subjugation of Red Boy, "the son of the Bull Demon King, reared by Raksasi" (2:244). The following poem cele- brates his splendor, as the novel's subtle treatment of these figures works to destabilize the very category of the impure demon: A face as if it had been powdered white, And lips so ruddy, they seemed brushed with paint. No dye could create such dark, lovely hair; His eyebrows curved like new moons carved with knives. Phoenix and dragon coiled on his battle kilt; More husky than Nata's a frame he had. (2:248) As with so many of the other demons, one of Red Boy's goals is to get a few bites of that tasty monk so that he "would be able to prolong his life until it became the same as Heaven and Earth. Every morning, therefore, he waited in the mountain, and suddenly he found that the pilgrim had arrived" (2:233). Success achieved at last, Red Boy captured the monk, only to incur the wrath of Monkey. But "the realized samadhi fire born of the demon's self-cultivation" was too much for Monkey, and he was quickly overcome (2:251). Red Boy, having captured the monk and Monkey, now assumes the form of Kuan-yin in order to capture the second pilgrim, Pigsy. Kuan-yin is truly frosted when she discovers this duplicity, for once again the prac- tice of transformation has been utilized as a means of classificatory eva- sion so that what was categorized as demonic now assumes the form of the highest divinity. Furthermore, as related to the exogenous demon, transformation is made a relativizing agent since that which stands at the apex of one structure blurs into the primary figurehead of the dominant structure and thus confuses all distinctions between the categories of sacred and profane, pure and impure. In fact, this categorical blurring for the purpose of highlighting structural relativity has precedent in Chinese religious history. Whalen Lai writes that there was a time when "the sacre still encompassed the sacred as well as the profane, the extraordinary as well as the subnormal" (333). And, indeed, one of the foundational tenets</page><page sequence="15">Cozad: Reeling in the Demon 131 of Ch'an points to the idea that "when the ultimate state of 'no-mind' has been realized, not gradually but as a sudden explosion, all distinction between holy and profane is obliterated" (Kitagawa and Cummings:147). As such, these demonic figures are much more than "those loci of bloated selfhood" a description entrenched within a singular paradigmatic func- tionalism and thus enslaved to the dominant structure's system of signifi- cation (Campany: 113). Rather, these figures operate as the loci of struc- tural disruption, for, in addition to destabilizing the centrality of the dominant structure as represented by San-chiao, they constitute a com- peting ideology that constructs an alternative generative framework, the content of which-in this particular instance-supports such values as resourcefulness,daring, individual attainment, and anarchy, and in so doing structures and sustains an alternative configuration of power and authority. As has been well-documented by Foucault, however, those in power will rarely sit still for this kind of disruption. Therefore, when Red Boy once more dares to compare himself with Kuan-yin as he climbs onto her lotus throne, the all compassionate bodhisattva tortures him into submis- sion. As for that monster spirit, both his legs were pierced till the points stuck out; Blood spouted in pools as flesh and skin were torn.... "Bodhisattva, your disciple has eyes but no pupils, and he could not perceive your vast dharma power. I beseech you to be merciful and spare my life." ... "Are you willing to receive my commandments?" she asked. Nodding his head as tears fell, the monster king said, "If you spare my life, I'm willing to receive the commandments."... "In that case," said the Bodhisattva, "I'll touch your head and give you the commandments." She took out from her sleeve a golden razor and approached the fiend. With a few strokes, she shaved his hair off and turned it into the style of the T'ai Mountain Crowning the Head: the top was completely bald, but three tufts of hair were left around the edge so that they could be knotted together into three tiny braids. Grinning broadly on one side, Pilgrim said, "How unfortunate for this monster-spirit! He looks like neither boy nor girl! I don't know what he looks like!" "Since you have received my command- ments," said the Bodhisattva, "I won't treat you lightly. I'll call you the Boy of Goodly Wealth. How's that?" (2:279). Rob Campany describes this tortuous conversion as "an elevation of status for the initially unwilling monster" (106). But from the perspective of Red Boy things couldn't get much worse, for in one fell swoop he is deprived of his locus within an alternative structure, his identity, and even his gender! Thus while depicted as an "upwardly mobile" fiend (Cam- pany: 99), Red Boy pursues upward mobility only in terms of his own</page><page sequence="16">132 Journal of the American Academy of Religion alternative framework and, as such, absolutely eschews any role within Kuan-yin's hierarchy: When he saw that his pains were gone and that his thighs had healed and, moreover, that the hair on his head had been made into three tiny braids, he picked up the lance and said to the Bodhisattva, "You don't have any true dharma power to subdue me! It's a kind of chicanery, that's all! I won't take your commandments! Watch the lance!" He lunged at the face of the Bodhisattva, and Pilgrim [Monkey] was so mad that he wielded his iron rod and was about to strike. "Don't hit him," the Bodhisattva cried, "I have my punishment for him." She took out from her sleeve a golden fillet, saying, "This treasure used to belong to our Buddha, who gave it to me when he sent me to search for the scripture pilgrim in the Land of the East. There were three fillets altogether: the Golden, the Constrictive, and the Prohibitive. The Constrictive Fillet was given to you [Monkey] first to wear, while the Prohibitive Fillet was used to make the guardian of my mountain submit [the Black Bear Monster]. Now that this fiend is so audacious, I'll give it to him." ... As the pain sub- sided, the monster-spirit collected himself and sat up to discover that there were golden fillets clasped tightly around his neck, his wrists, and his ankles. ... Look at him! He dropped the lance all at once, and his two hands were pressed together so tightly before his chest that he could not move them apart at all. This is thus the origin of the "Kuan-yin Twist," a posture assumed by the attendant of the Bodhisattva which you can see in portraits and paintings today. (2:280-282) Thus, physically tortured into the shape of a tutelary deity by means of the Buddha's fillet, this dangerous exogenous demon is forcefully incorpo- rated into the celestial ranks. This emphasis upon the subjugating power of Buddhist relics is found elsewhere in the novel as the narrative recounts the legend of Prince Nata and and his father, Devaraja Li.6 Much like Monkey, Prince Nata displays a chaotic nature from the moment of his birth.' But his disruptive conduct proves too much for his magisterial father, Devaraja Li, one of the twenty divine guardians of order, and thus he "sought to have him killed" (4:131). This enraged Prince Nata who then "cut off his own flesh to give it back to his mother and carved up his bones to give them back to his father" (4:131). Through his actions Nata rejects any and all relationship with the naturalized order of things, as he dissolves the parent/child relationship and with it the all-important Confucian mandate of filial piety. 6 See the Feng-shen yen-i for a full account of the legend of Prince Nata and Devaraija Li. 7 It should be noted that a designation of "chaotic" marks any tendency or action that is per- ceived to disrupt the dominant construction of order.</page><page sequence="17">Cozad: Reeling in the Demon 133 The disembodied soul of Prince Nata soon attracts the attention of the Buddha who restores Nata to life. Once again powerfully incarnate but under the Buddha's sway, Prince Nata is charged with keeping order and "subduing the demons of ninety-six caves" (4:132). However, as we have seen in previous examples, those powerful others who exceed a particular classificatory structure will resist their containment within that structure, and Prince Nata proves to be no exception: " [Prince Nata's] magic powers were so great that he later wanted to kill the devaraja in order to exact vengeance for self-immolation. The devardja had little choice but to plead with Tathdgata .... He therefore bestowed on the devaraja a compliant, yellow-gold treasure pagoda of the finest open-work carving and filled with s'ri-relics. . . . The sight of the pagoda thus would remind Nata of Buddha, who was to be revered as the prince's true father .. "' (4:132). This process of containing the chaotic by means of Buddhist relics has been prevalent throughout the history of Buddhism. As noted by Bernard Faure, "they [Buddhist masters] became engrossed in enshrining relics and erecting stfipas in order to fix dangerous chthonian influences, thus creating new centers, new sacred spaces or places" (1987: 355). In viewing Prince Nata's containment from this perspective it is clear that the Bud- dha, through his relics, restrains the disruptive tendencies of the Prince by establishing a new hierarchy. Instead of restoring the Prince to his original position as the direct subject of his father, Devaraja Li, Prince Nata is made subordinate to the Buddha in a masterful reconfiguration of the hierarchical bonds of filial piety. Later in the narrative the tables are turned, however, as the tale of the garuda monster known as the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles is held up as an explicit challenge to the Buddha's authority. Described as "no fiendish creature of the mortal world," this most powerful bird "whips up the wind and transports the seas; he reaches the north and rules the south" (3:407). Following the same narrative structure as the preceding examples, the roc captures the monk and overcomes Monkey. However, unlike either Black Bear or Red Boy, it takes more than one of the Buddha's erstwhile assistants armed with a Buddhist relic to contain this magnificent fowl. In fact, only the Buddha himself can match the powers of the roc as the novel persists in its relativization of classificatory structures by asserting a fa- milial relationship between these two figures. "All at once Pilgrim blurted out 'Tathagata! I have heard people say that that monster-spirit is related to you!' The Buddha replied, 'Since the great roc has the same parent as the peacock, it could be said that he was somewhat related to me.' On hear- ing this, Pilgrim said with a smile, 'Tathagata, according to what you've told me, you should be regarded as the nephew of that monster-spirit!"' (4:32-33). Depicted as such, the Buddha is not only brought into relation</page><page sequence="18">134 Journal of the American Academy of Religion with but also made subordinate to the great roc, as his ultimate authority is thrown into question by "this insolent ape!" (4:32). Through the continual expenditure of his power the Buddha is finally able to control the bird as he "had the roc firmly detained on top of his halo as a guardian" (4:36). The roc's tutelary status is immediately com- promised, however, as the Buddha is unable to subdue the bird's outlaw desires and, in fact agrees to provide for the offering of fleshly sacrifices to this carnivorous spirit: "'In the four great continents of my domain,' said Tathdgata, 'there are countless worshipers. I shall ask those who wish to do good to sacrifice first to your mouth"' (4:36). Monkey soon topples even this semblance of tutelary subservience as he makes. the following observation: "The Buddha Tathagata is the honored one who governs the world, and yet he still sits beneath the great roc" (4:179). Perched upon the Buddha's head, the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles is not to be vanquished and thus exemplifies the potential for ascendancy that resides within the exogenous mediator turned tutelary deity. While brilliantly illustrated by the novel, the realized threat of the exo- genous mediator/tutelary deity is certainly not without historical prece- dent. In fact, the author of The Journey to the West had such source mate- rials close at hand, for the original Hsuan Tsang in his roundtrip journey from China to India brought back not only "the law from India" but also an enormous number of conversion myths starring that sacred forerunner of the dragon-the niga (Chau). Lowell Bloss writes: "The naga is most accurately described as a folk deity possessing those powers of nature, par- ticularly rain, which so totally determine the character of the agricultural- ist's existence" (1973: 37). As the presence of this very popular religious tradition hindered the propagation of the Buddhist faith, Buddhist ideo- logues forced the niga to undergo a process of demonization in order to look "legit" in the co-optation and containment of this powerful historical other. Thus, in a two-step strategy that encapsulates the containment process imposed on the Black Bear, Red Boy, and the roc, ntigas were often depicted as "evil beings" (Ray:192) in order to allow for their incorpora- tion as tutelary figures. Myths that herald the benevolent actions of the niagas come to be replaced as "the chaotic or ambiguous side of the naga and the yaksa was accentuated by the Buddhists in order to illustrate the Buddha's compassionate activity and superior power" (Bloss 1973: 45).8 8 Not only did this move allow the Buddhists to negate a competing ideology but also, as Lowell Bloss has noted, through co-opting these very popular fertility deities, Buddhist ideologues found a means of reaching an audience which was not naturally inclined toward the ascetic and other-worldly nature of the Buddha (Bloss 1973). Thus, in this example we see another way that the dominant structure has made use of the demonized other: as a vehicle toward incorporating within the domi- nant structure those who participate within an alternative structure, the idea being that as you incor- porate the symbol, you incorporate those who worship the symbol.</page><page sequence="19">Cozad: Reeling in the Demon 135 Underlying these recorded myths, however, is the reality that such conversions have a tendency to come undone as the demonized other reasserts its centrality along with the centrality of the structure for which it stands as a symbol. The story of the niiga Muchilinda is a perfect illus- tration of this process: "Soon after his enlightenment, the Buddha wan- ders to various places for meditation. One week of meditation is spent beneath the tree of the ndgaraja Muchilinda. According to most sources, while the Buddha was sitting under this tree, wind and rain arose. At this, the nagaraja came from his abode and coiled himself around the Buddha seven times spreading his hood over the blessed one's head" (Bloss 1973: 49). What is most interesting for our purposes, however, is that far from portraying the Blessed One, illustrations of this story often show a huge naga engulfing a barely visible Buddha, and as such "the Buddha also came to be identified or subsumed by the ndga" (Bloss 1973: 52). Bloss also discusses this reversal of fortunes in terms of the stuipas of Amardvati and Ndgarjunakonda: "On these stilpas, the naga is placed at times in the position of the Buddha or his more recognized symbols, such as the cakra or throne" (1973: 52). Thus, just as the great roc assumed a position of ascendancy over the Buddha, the niaga reassumes its centrality in a marvelous transposition that marks the demonized other as the locus of structural disruption. FINAL STOP: SUBVERTING THE STRUCTURE Peripheralized, demonized, fixed at the gateway, the tutelary deity stands poised-always ready to spring-at the juncture of competing classificatory structures. Understood as such, this holding cell for the dis- placed other is precisely the site from which an alternative ideological contender will emerge. Thus, having elucidated the way in which the exogenous demon can be made to function, the author of The Journey to the West now puts this figure to the test through the remarkable charac- terization of Monkey. A favorite of Mao Tse Tung, this ontologically per- verse other begins his career far from the reaches of heaven and is out of the natural order from the get-go: "You see, though this monkey resem- bled a human being, he was not listed under the names of men; though he resembled the short-haired creatures, he did not dwell in their kingdoms; though he resembled other animals, he was not subject to the unicorn; and though he resembled flying creatures, he was not governed by the phoenix. He had, therefore, a separate ledger, which Wu-k'ung examined himself. Under the heading 'Soul 1350' he found the name Sun Wu'k'ung recorded, with the description: 'Heaven-born Stone Monkey. Age: three hundred and forty-two years. A good end.'" (1:111). Not content with sin- gularity, however, he vanquishes all possibility of systemic classification.</page><page sequence="20">136 Journal of the American Academy of Religion "All I want is to erase my name. Bring me a brush. ... Throwing down the ledger, he said, 'That's the end of the account, the end of the account! Now I'm truly not your subject"' (1:111). Subject to no one, he rules over a kingdom of unclassified little monkeys; powerful and dangerous, he is "the famous ranking daimon of all times!" (1:352). As such, he is given the following warning: "You have stolen the cre- ative powers of Heaven and Earth and invaded the dark mysteries of sun and moon. Your success in mixing the elixir is something that the gods and demons cannot countenance" (1:89). And indeed they cannot; for, as we have seen with Black Bear, Red Boy, and the great roc, those powerful others who cannot be contained through destruction must be contained through tutelary incorporation. However, as Monkey is far more powerful than any of the previous three, his conversion to tutelary status must pro- ceed in stages. Thus, when the Monkey-King first challenges Heaven, demanding to be made the "Great Sage, Equal to Heaven," the celestial palace calls upon a strategy much used within Chinese political history, by which the imperial court attempted to contain powerful rebels through a program of pacification: "Even if reinforcements are sent to fight him, I don't think he can be subdued right away without taxing our forces. It would be better if Your Majesty were greatly to extend your mercy and proclaim yet another decree of pacification. Let him indeed be made the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven; he will be given an empty title, in short, rank without compensation... .We shall keep him here in Heaven so that we may put his perverse mind at rest and make him desist from his madness and arrogance. The universe will then be calm and the oceans tranquil again" (1:131). In the same manner that this strategy usually backfired within secular politics, the cosmic bureaucracy soon finds that it's hard to keep a good demon down, especially one who has mastered the arts of seventy-two transformations, who can cloud somersault over continents and, most importantly, whose perception of his own non-contextualized singularity renders hierarchy meaningless. In other words, he is one who refuses his role in a scheme of binary opposition, thus destabilizing a system in which "opposition and homology are complementary and hierarchical processes" (Jenkins: 34). "As for the Nine Luminaries, the Generals of the Five quarters, the Twenty-Eight constellations, the Four Devardjas, the Twelve Horary Branches, the Five Elders of the Five Regions, the Star Spirits of the entire Heaven, and the numerous gods of the Milky Way, he called them all brother and treated them in a fraternal manner" (1:134). And equally solicitous of his demonic cohorts, Monkey declares, "If little brother is now called the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven, why don't all of you assume the title of Great Sage also?" (1:130).</page><page sequence="21">Cozad: Reeling in the Demon 137 From the viewpoint of the cosmic bureaucracy, "the baneful monkey knows how to make a speech, but he has no idea what's appropriate and what isn't" (1:131). Clearly, Monkey is the powerful other who disdains what is "appropriate" and, as such, disdains that cosmic order which "appropriate" norms sustain. Given such an orientation, he is the ultimate disrupter. This he proves on his very first heavenly assignment: "'We per- ceive, said the Jade Emperor, 'that your life is quite indolent, since you have nothing to do, and we have decided therefore to give you an assign- ment. You will temporarily take care of the Garden of Immortal Peaches. Be careful and diligent, morning and evening"' (1:135). Far from being "careful and diligent," he creates the utmost havoc as the Nine Luminar- ies declare in perfect unison: "You senseless pi-ma-wen! You are guilty of the ten evils. You first stole peaches and then wine, utterly disrupting the Grand Festival of Immortal Peaches. You also robbed Lao Tzu of his immortal elixir, and then you had the gall to plunder the imperial winery for your personal enjoyment. Don't you realize that you have piled up sin upon sin?" (1:147). Having set the stage with Red Boy, Black Bear, and the roc, as the exogenous demon is presented as the embodiment of an alternative struc- ture, the novelist has created the space for the promotion of Monkey as a fully-realized representative of an historically recognized religious al- ternative: the trickster ideal of Ch'an Buddhism. In fact, in his discussion of the Ch'an trickster figure, Bernard Faure points to Monkey as paradig- matically illustrative of this structural type: "The trickster has a long his- tory in China. We need mention only the legends of Dong Fangshuo and Sun Wukong [Monkey], who both reached immortality by stealing the peaches of Xiwangmu, the Queen Mother of the West" (1991: 115). Char- acterized as composed of disparate elements-"a silk shirt on his body, a tiger kilt tied around his waist" (3:118), the perspicacity of the Ch'an adept embodied in "a hideous figure" (3: 274)-the novel's descriptions of Mon- key explicitly mirror that of the Ch'an trickster figures: "their ambivalent persona contains both comic and uncanny elements, and their smile looks like a grimace" (Faure 1991: 117). Furthermore, the extent to which this liminal and animalistic Ch'an figure disrupted traditional social models is exemplified by the fact that within Chinese social/political history the Ch'an trickster most closely paralleled that socially liminal figure, the "barbarian" (the quintessential "other," beyond Chinese culture and law), who was perceived to be ugly (for visage denotes character) and who was often depicted as an animal: "Throughout the history of Imperial China there was some hesitation in applying the noun jen [the noble man] to include Barbarians ... until civilized they tend to be classed rather with the beasts and birds" (Graham: 19; brackets mine).</page><page sequence="22">138 Journal of the American Academy of Religion In terms of San-chiao-and especially the tenets of orthodox Bud- dhism-this Ch'an trickster appears as the embodiment of chaos who must be incorporated to insure the maintenance of the dominant struc- ture. Monkey is thus forced into submission in a similar representation of the Buddha's defeat of Mark-the Evil One-from the Lokapafifiatti: "Surrendering to the Thera, Mark is bound to a mountain by Upagupta's belt and remains tied to the mountain" (Bloss 1978: 171). In Monkey's case, rather than a belt, it is the five fingers of the Buddha that bind the wily creature, as elements of Chinese cosmogony are incorporated into a Buddhist conversion myth. "The five fingers were transformed into the Five Phases of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. They became, in fact, five connected mountains, named Five-Phases Mountain, which pinned him down with just enough pressure to keep him there" (1:174). And just as Red Boy, Black Bear, and the great roc "progressed" from demonic other to tutelary deity, Monkey is released after serving 500 years of bondage in his stone cell in order to serve and guard the Buddhist monk. Furthermore, in the same manner as Black Bear, Red Boy, Prince Nata, and countless nagas and yaksas throughout the history of Bud- dhism, Monkey is given a relic of the Buddha to act as a reminder of his submission; for as the Mahavamr.sa declares, "If we behold the relics, we behold the Conqueror (Buddha)" (Bloss 1973: 47). "Pilgrim [Monkey] touched his head with his hand and felt that it was tightly bound by a thin metal band; it could be neither pulled off nor ripped apart, for it had, as it were, taken root on his head. Taking the needle out of his ear, he rammed it inside the fillet and started prying madly. Afraid that he might break the fillet with his prying, Tripitaka [the Monk] started his recitation again, and Pilgrim's head began to hurt once more. It was so painful that he did cartwheels and somersaults; his face and even his ears turned red; his eyes bulged; and his body grew weak" (1:313). As previewed by Red Boy, Black Bear, Prince Nata, and the roc, once the demonic other is forcefully integrated into the dominant classificatory structure as a tutelary deity, his powers prove most useful. This is certainly the case with Monkey, as the monk is allowed to remain pure while Mon- key becomes the doer of necessary dirty deeds-killing monsters, fighting demons, stealing everything from food and drink to magical treasures, coercing intransigent gods, and engaging in trickery with all and sundry. In fact, Monkey carries out his transgressive duties precisely by employing the magical powers of the Ch'an adept. Thus, just as the historical fore- runner of the Ch'an magician Maudgalyayana defeats his nciga adversaries by changing into "a tiny being who can fly unseen into their noses and ears" (Faure 1991: 103), Monkey often enacts this very transformation in order to terrorize his demonic antagonists into submission. And beyond</page><page sequence="23">Cozad: Reeling in the Demon 139 such theatrics it is precisely Monkey's power of discernment, flowing from the Ch'an ideal of an illuminated mind, that enables him to distinguish truth from falsehood and, therefore, provides the very means by which the pilgrims make their progress. As the preceding discussion regarding Monkey's skills as a Ch'an adept has demonstrated, the powers of the exogenous demon, while used within the dominant structure, will flow from their structure of origin. This connection between other power and other structures moves Grot- tanelli's description of "'other' power"-that which is "in opposition to the 'central' powers"-from its subordinate position within a dominant paradigm to a concrete base within an alternative structure. Thus, return- ing to Monkey, in examining not only his thaumaturgic abilities but also his great power to discern "absolute reality, free from the dichotomy of form and formlessness" (Zhou: 74), both can be seen to derive from the alternative structure of Ch'an. This brings us to the heart of our religious mosaic, or what one might call the primary antagonistic relationship. For, while the novel clearly "is elaborated in terms of not one but all three religions of China: Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism" (Yu 1987:124), the focal point of The Journey centers around the complex interaction between Monkey-the Ch'an trickster-and the Monk, Hsuan Tsang-the representative of traditional Buddhism. Furthermore, the author clearly uses the two-faced nature of the trickster figure/tutelary deity-"who has always retained a potentially subversive character" (Faure 1991: 125)-first to destabilize the reigning position of San-chiao and second to distinguish the unique nature of Ch'an in relation to the established schools of Buddhism. In the first instance Monkey is consistently shown to upstage the representatives of the three major religious traditions. As such, not only does he constantly thwart the goals of the Confucian celestial bureaucracy, but also he "pisses on the Buddha's middle finger, consigns the icons of the Taoist trinity to the privy, and tricks their unwary disciples into drinking his own urine by passing it for 'holy water"' (Yu 1987: 135). Second, the novel's portrayal of the Monk is a far cry from the original Hsuan Tsang, who by all accounts was not only an extremely courageous sojourner but also a peerless scholar. However, "the Hsuan Tsang of the novel is almost an exact oppo- site of the historical figure in mind and character. Though he is perhaps no less tenacious than the real Tripitaka in his commitment to seek the scriptures, he shows little knowledge of the object of his quest and virtu- ally no understanding of his own experiences" (Yu 1987: 123). Thus the Monk in his slavish devotion to the formulaic doctrines of the Mahayana school is portrayed as constantly jeopardizing the pilgrimage because he paralyzes the pilgrims' progress. This description of the Monk is explicitly</page><page sequence="24">140 Journal of the American Academy of Religion demonstrated when Monkey intuitively infers the evil intentions of a transformed demon but is punished for having killed the fiend by the Monk's recitation of the tight fillet spell. "At once Pilgrim began to scream 'My head! My head! Stop reciting! Stop reciting! If you've got something to say, say it.' 'What do I have to say?' asked the T'ang monk. 'Those who have left the family must defer to people every time, must cherish kind- ness in every thought. They must keep ants out of harm's way when they sweep the floor, and put shades on lamps for the love of moths. And you, you practice violence with every step!"' (2:24). In this example as in many others the Monk's concern "with the externalization of salvation into manifest religious practice and techniques" (Zhou: 75) is depicted as an obstacle, while Ch'an creeds focusing on self-enlightenment are portrayed as necessary and efficacious. The novel makes great use of the ambiguity implicit in Monkey's tute- lary assignment, as this most "famous ranking daimon of all times" is hopped back and forth between the roles of master and mastered, teacher and disciple, authority and henchman, until finally Monkey brings the troop of pilgrims to their final reward through his unparalleled capacity to distinguish between falsehood and truth (1:352). Zuyan Zhou writes: "The reversal between the master and the disciple can be perceived throughout Journey ... with the dull-witted master being constantly instructed and enlightened by the disciple" (73). As Zhou has noted, this inversion of roles is especially explicit in the following passage: "Trem- bling all over, Tripitaka scrambled up to tug at Pilgrim and plead with him, 'O worthy disciple! How will we face this?' 'If you want to face this,' said Pilgrim, 'the old must become the young.' 'What do you mean by that?' asked Sha Monk. Pilgrim said, 'If you want to preserve your life, the master will have to become the disciple, and the disciple will have to become the master.' 'If you can save my life,' said Tripitaka, 'I'm willing to be your disciple and grand disciple"' (4:53). It is important to note, however, that the emergence of Monkey as a teacher and a guide does not imply a hierarchical inversion of Ch'an over the orthodox schools. Rather, it describes an attempt to negate the con- cept of hierarchy altogether, not only as Ch'an is promoted as "a tradition self-consciously distinct from traditional Buddhism" (Faure 1991: 18) but also as this denial of hierarchy is asserted to be one of the central dialec- tics within Ch'an itself. "The dialectic is therefore not one of surpassing (which still implies mastery, hierarchy, power) but rather one of sub- version-the result of an 'interstitial thinking,' of an active disjunction of monolithic 'structures"' (Faure 1991: 30). Monkey is the perfect me- dium for such a message, since that which cannot be contained is under- stood to cause the "active disjunction of monolithic structures." And in</page><page sequence="25">Cozad: Reeling in the Demon 141 the reality of that interstitial nature resides all the beauty, truth, and sub- versive essence of particularity, a particularity that consistently shoulders apart and overruns the constraints of a hierarchical classificatory struc- ture, thus allowing, in this case, Monkey to spring forward as the repre- sentative of this "antiinstitutional institution" (Faure 1991: 18). While much speculation has surrounded Monkey and the primacy of his role within the 100-chapter narrative, it is no surprise that the author of The Journey to the West chose a monkey to do his subversive work, for monkeys have long been used as vehicles of social satire within the Chinese popular milieu (Zhou: 71). "Peasants come with their tame animals-usu- ally mice, but sometimes also trained dogs or monkeys. The animals play short scenes from Chinese history or mythology, always with an element of social criticism, such as when the monkey wears the cap of an official and thus characterizes a bad official " (Eberhard: 61). Furthermore, Monkey's Hindu counterpart, Hanuman from the Ramayana, may have contributed to the possibility of a monkey's deified status, as Hanuman's role pushed those who "would have to beat the drum and the gong on the streets and perform every kind of trick to entertain humans" (2:36) to a position of cosmic elevation within the "unprecedented cult of the Monkey King in the Fukien area during the late Tang and early Sung" (Mair: 696).' This syncretic convergence of narrative motifs certainly sets the stage for the presentation of a Ch'an trickster embodied by a monkey posi- tioned at the locus of structural disruption. And, as any effort to displace a central ideology must be tendered with care, it is clever of The ]ourney's author to sneak up on his subject through the ambiguous guise of the tutelary deity,' especially so since the Late Ming period was a time of intense ideological upheaval during which certain factions were attempt- ing to promote particular Ch'an ideals as a model for social change. The left wing of the Wang Yangming school encompassed the primary actors within this movement, especially the radical thinker Li Zhi, whose incono- clasm disrupted official culture (Zhou: 70). For, while official culture was founded on the state-sanctioned precepts of Neo-Confucianists, Wang and his followers were influenced by "especially Ch'an tenets" and were accused "by their opponents of being Buddhists in disguise" (Ch'en: 472). These accusations stemmed from the fact that the Ch'an doctrine of Sudden Enlightenment formed the foundation of Wang's and Li Zhi's 9 In the marvelous roundabout that signals narrative transmission, however, it should be noted that Chinese stories of a licentious white ape may very well have influenced the development of the South and Southeast Asian Hanuman (Mair: 720). 10 Clearly, the consequences of promoting an alternative ideology can be extremely severe, as was demonstrated by the historical Hsuan Tsang who was forced to sneak out of China under penalty of death in order to fulfill his quest for Mahaydna Buddhist scriptures.</page><page sequence="26">142 Journal of the American Academy of Religion belief that all human beings are innately capable of attaining knowledge through direct intuition. As such, the radical wing of the Wang Yangming school "launched a 'Wild Chan' movement which asserted the alliance, or 'misalliance,' of sagehood and common men" (Zhou: 90). They then utilized these precepts to advocate such social reforms as the dismantl- ing of governmental institutions in favor of self rule. Li Zhi writes in his Essay on Governance: "Indeed, the superior man allows people to rule themselves. " This being so, "all precepts, regulations, and proscriptions are unnecessary" (Goodrich and Fang: 810), which is basically the same message that Monkey has embodied throughout the Journey. The mu- tual influence discernable between, as Zhou puts it, the "carnivalized culture" that Wang and Li fomented and the "carnivalized novel" that Wu Cheng-en produced (70), is further documented as there exists an early edition of the 100-chapter novel putatively annotated by Li Zhi himself." Clearly then, it was just this syle of kuang chan, or "wild Ch'an," exempli- fied by Monkey, that served as a model for social reformers such as Li Zhi and the more radical members of the Wang Yangming school. END OF THE ROAD Bernard Faure in his study of Ch'an tricksters states that many of these figures "refused to be assigned a place in the structure" (1991: 122)-a fascinating stance, and one that defines for me the quintessential nature of the other: one who cannot be contained within a dominant classi- ficatory structure, as one's particularity presents an alternative to that structure. Thus, this paper has been an attempt to make sense of this interstitial particularity as it is understood to be an alternative locus of sense-making. It is only possible to explore these themes within a work as com- plex and multi-valenced as The Journey to the West. For not only does this novel elucidate the structure-straddling position and thus the potentially subversive role of the exogenous demon turned tutelary deity, but it also moves from theory to practice as it utilizes this figure to promote an alter- native religio/ethical structure, that of kuang chan, or "wild Ch'an." This is a crucial contribution when one considers that this process of demoniza- tion, a well-known cause of concern for many of us, has affected countless humans throughout history: those others who by virtue of their gender, their race, their physical and or mental condition, their religious prefer- ence, and or their sexual preference have been turned "into pariahs ... because their condition was ambiguous, borderline" (Ginzburg: 39)-or 11 I am indebted to Anthony Yu for pointing out the existence of this particular document.</page><page sequence="27">Cozad: Reeling in the Demon 143 in other words, because their interstitial particularity worked to rupture the chambers of a dominant classificatory structure. Too often, however, especially within scholarly literature that exam- ines the dynamics of power and hierarchy, these demonized humans are rescued from their status as "pariahs," only to be re-castigated as victims of oppression, and, quite frankly, I for one would rather be relegated to the role of a demon than be eviscerated as a victim. Thus, it is lovely to find a work such as The Journey to the West that portrays the other neither as a mere threat to established order nor as a victim of established order, both of which presume the primacy of the dominant structure and in so doing simply highlight the liminality of the individualized other. Rather, this novel not only recognizes but actually utilizes the other as an embodi- ment of a positive and concrete alternative structure, which is configured around the unique content of one's particularity. In this move the novel recognizes not only that the demon is not merely demonic but also that the other is not merely other, as both are freed from their lock-step rela- tion to the dominant structure to constitute an option among options, a norm among norms. It is precisely because this book inspires such explorations that it remains relevant some 700 years after its first presentation. In conclu- sion, it is interesting to note that, just as Black Bear, Red Boy, the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles, Prince Nata, and Monkey, in all their glo- rious individuality, were forced to undergo a process of demonization, the popular novel as well has often been condemned to the category of demonized literature. Victor Mair writes: "Particularly during the Sung, Ming, and Ching periods, but generally throughout Chinese history, the guardians of orthodoxy (and here much of the Buddhist elite establish- ment and the upper echelons of the Taoist hierarchy could be included) systematically excluded so-called 'vulgar,' 'heretical ' and 'forged' litera- ture (731). Given this state of affairs, demonized literature such as The Journey to the West provides the perfect vehicle for an exploration of oth- erness, as one sifts through the layers to reveal those demonized structural alternatives that occur just below the surface.
