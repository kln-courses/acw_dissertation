It is not enough merely to be great, for the great painter may impound us unendurably in the singleness of his obsession. To be continuously interesting through a year's worth of pictures, an artist must , ' have eyes that gluttonize in every direction and an absolute command of hand. Such a one was Hokusai. Hokusai was born in 1760 in what is now Tokyo. All his life he was as poor as his father, who polished mirrors for a subsistence. When he was a small boy drawing pictures, the Japanese began to print woodcuts in several colors. In his early teens, Hokusai was cutting wood blocks for publishers, and at eighteen he started to draw for other cutters in the studio of Shunsho. He adopted part of his master's name, calling himself Shunro, to show how completely he succumbed to Shunsho's rather weary style in prints of sulky, silken courtesans and the actors who impersonated them. If Hokusai had died before he was forty, while still lingering in this listless elegance, he would have been forgotten. He developed late in his eighty-nine years of life by dint of making over 10,000 woodcuts and some 30,000 to 40,000 drawings. Thus he was not altogether assuming humility when he said, at the age of seventy-five: "I have drawn things since I was six. All that I made before the age of sixty-five is not worth counting. At seventy-three I began to understand the true construction of animals, plants, trees, birds, fishes and insects. [He omits men.] At ninety I will enter into the secret of things. At a hundred I shall certainly have reached a magnificent level; and when I am a hundred and ten, everything-every dot, every dash-will live." Hokusai died in 1849, four years before Commodore Perry introduced foreigners into Japanese life. For over two centuries a few Dutch merchants had been tolerated on a three-hundred-yard rectangle of earth dumped into Nagasaki harbor for the confinement of outsiders. Hokusai, observing everything, once shows a "high nose" peering out of a window beyond a board wall, and being peered at from the street. Even though the Dutch were forbidden to cross the narrow bridge to the mainland, their clothes, their guns, their magnifying glasses, and their books did. Hokusai, living just when Japanese ideas were beginning to rub against ideas from Europe, can no longer quite believe in the fairy tale esthetics of the Lady Murasaki a thousand years before. Even the old ways of representing the world are going, for in one of his prints a Japanese street converges to a vanishing point, with figures diminishing in the distance, just like a plate in any western perspective book. His studies of fat people and thin people could well be Diirer's anatomical comparisons set to capering. Whenever and wherever old ideas begin to be questioned, the unsettling generates energy. The breakup of ancient Japanese ideas supplies the motor that convulses Hokusai's wrestlers, fishermen, and jugglers. The pace of change drives him to explore every doing and happening of Japanese daily life as he saw it in his studio, the street. He is the only Japanese printmaker who threw himself into the turmoil of the slums rather than the high-flown sham of the stage. Hokusai traveled fast because he traveled light, carrying little more than his brushes and his paper, changing his abode ninety-three times, and as restlessly adopting over thirty different names. As he flew, he absorbed every style that he saw, keeping consistently only the Japanese convention that ignores shadows. Shadows would have obstructed the racing of his line as it describes things with disembodied subtlety. 5</page><page sequence="7">Japanese and Chinese artists are able to fling out lines writhing like strings in the wind because they do not move their brushes with the little muscle of their fingers, as we might do, but with the large muscles of their arm and shoulder. Nothing touches the paper but the brush tip that goes and goes, driven by the dread of a pause that might drop a blot. Such a way of drawing puts its effort in outline and summarizes inner detail. The Japanese and Chinese see no interior logic of bone and muscle in their shadowless figures, and they escape our Greek abstract ideal of the body-never realized in nature to concentrate their convention on the painted face of the geisha and the actor. In Japanese prints the clean lines bound the transparent colors without crossing and obscuring them- sky tints that stain through the tough diaphanous tissue of the mulberry paper. These air colors capture the out-of-doors for a people who live more at the mercy of nature than we do, the rain stinging their cheeks through the splits in their straw rain clothes, the chill in their paper houses disjointing their fingers. In Hokusai's prints, the wind-squalls scatter hats and bully people, the snow blinds with awesome cold. We are far from the mild valleys of classic Chinese painting, where a philosopher pauses to contemplate the October mist on the cliffs, and time runs visibly in the rivers. Hokusai lived in the knockabout struggle of today. Like Daumier, he seemed a graphic buffoon to his contemporaries, but has grown with the years to a stature of command. A.

Brush drawing in ink. 6</page><page sequence="8">NOTES ON HOKUSAI'S WOOD-BLOCK PRINTS iE J sL,/y Although Hokusai did not live to be one hundred years old, the age at which he expected to reach "a magnificent level," the bulk of work he left behind is a testimony to his remarkable achievement as an artist. Even excluding Hokusai's paintings, one can easily see the scope of his work from his drawings Jj^ilTO^! .I 0 land prints, as demonstrated in the following pages. Hokusai's surviving early work is mainly book illustration and surimono, prints privately issued for special occasions and frequently accompanied by -4^^^^P v poems. In Ehon Sumidagawa Ryogan Ichiran (The Picture Book of the Views Along Both Banks of the Sumida River), about 1801-2, Hokusai presents in panorama a continuous view of the river, beginning at the mouth and ending at the upper stream, and closing with a scene of the Yoshiwara quarter of Edo (now Tokyo). The illustrations continue page by page, in the same way that a scroll painting is unrolled section by section. Hokusai not only includes the people engaged in different activities on the near shore but also incorporates the distant view across the river (p. 14). A similar depiction of the far shore, though less prominent, is also seen in a single-sheet print, Imado River (p. 23, below). Hokusai's subjects ranged from animals, plants, landscapes, and human figures to historical and supernatural themes. He produced voluminous sketches covering all these subjects on a trip to Nagoya in 1812, when he stayed with one of his pupils, Gekkotei Bokusen. From these drawings, craftsmen made wood-block prints that were published as Hokusai Manga in 1814 (vol. 1). Further volumes, created from other drawings, followed in 1815-19 (vols. 2-10), 1834 (vol. 12), 1849 (vol. 13), and 1878 (vol. 15). The dates of volumes 11 and 14 are not yet certain. The full title Denshin Kaishu: Hokusai Manga, which may be translated as "beginner's manual for transmitting the true image: as Hokusai pleases," was commonly known as Hokusai Manga or Manga. The word manga then denoted "a manual of drawing," as opposed to its contemporary meaning of "comics or satires." Many pages of the Manga are randomly filled with small figures engaged in different activities, a variety of birds and plants probably drawn from nature, or landscapes in all kinds of weather conditions. Others are more thought-out designs that could easily have become pages of an illustrated book (pp. 19, above and below; 27, below; 29). The freely rendered brush drawing of a man riding a donkey (p. 48) shows a striking resemblance to the images in the Manga; this or a similar drawing could have served as a hanshita-e (under-drawing) for the Manga. Among Hokusai's other instructional books was Hokusai Gashiki (Method of Drawing by Hokusai), a selection of designs on a variety of subjects, published in collaboration with Hokusai's Osaka pupils- Senkakutei Hokuyo, Sekkatei Hokushufi, and Shunyosai Hokky6-in 1819. In contrast to the Manga, whose pages are crowded with small designs, Hokusai Gashiki has on each double page a single design that clearly demonstrates a style of the master in a larger format (p. 12). Ehon Musashi Abumi (Picture Book of the Stirrups of the Braves), 1836 (p. 28, below) and Ehon Wakan no Homare (Picture Book of the Glory of Japan and China), 1850 (pp. 27, above; 28, above)-two of three books generally known as the Warrior Trilogy-display the linear style often associated with Hokusai's work of around the 1830s. The blocks for Ehon Musashi Abumi were probably made about 1836 but were not printed until after Hokusai's death. Figures are executed with fine strokes in combination with 7</page><page sequence="9">accentuated contour lines, whereas landscapes are shaded with angular strokes and dots-a common convention in Chinese landscape painting as well as in Nanga, the Japanese literati painting inspired by Chinese painting of the same kind. Hokusai's spontaneous brushwork may be seen not only in his printed books, but also in his drawings. He captures playful sparrows hopping around an old hat with the utmost simplicity and economy of line. The sparrows and the hat are drawn with dabs of brown wash and broad brushstrokes that are contoured with contrasting thin lines (p. 13, above). Countless images produced for the Manga may have served as a groundwork for Hokusai's best-known single-sheet prints, The Thirty-six Views of Fuji, about 1831-33, where landscape became the major theme for the first time in the history of Japanese prints. Ten prints with black outlines, the so-called "rear-view Fuji," were subsequent additions to the initial set of thirty-six, with blue outlines. In Rainstorm Beneath the Summit (pp. 46-47), Mt. Fuji towers peacefully above the turbulent weather suggested by the white rain clouds and the thunderbolt. Here the majestic Fuji dominates an entire scene in which human figures are completely eliminated, while in other prints in the set (pp. 40-41; 44, below; 45) the human element is unobtrusively present. In The Great Wave off Kanagawa, for example, huge anthropomorphic waves appear to engulf the tiny people holding onto their wooden boats. The viewer's eye is directed by the boats toward the left, swiftly taken upward by the splashing waves, and then returned to the center where Fuji stands undisturbed beyond the rough waves. Other prints in the series (pp. 33, above; 34-35; 36-37; 38; 39; 42-43; 44, above) depict landscapes and activities of ordinary people set against the familiar presence of Mt. Fuji. Throughout the series, the viewer's attention is always directed to the graceful view of this admired mountain, no matter how small Fuji may be portrayed. In other genres, Hokusai proved that birds and flowers could be just as exciting subjects for single-sheet prints as actors and beauties, themes favored by the masses. His images of plants are based upon observation from nature, but he goes far beyond morphological accuracy, capturing his subjects' very essence. In the print of irises (pp. 10-11), a sense of vibrant life is suggested by the flowers in different stages of bloom, as well as by the torn leaf that may have been eaten by the grasshopper discreetly holding onto it. In his later years, Hokusai frequently sought ideas from the classics. In one of the prints from the series Famous Bridges in Various Provinces, about 1833-34, Hokusai adopts the theme of yatsuhashi (eight- plank bridge). The yatsuhashi in Mikawa province, now Aichi prefecture, was a place celebrated for the lovely irises surrounding the bridge and was one of the subjects favored by artists ever since it was mentioned in the tenth-century Tales of Ise, a collection of romantic episodes in the life of a courtier. In Hokusai's print (pp. 30-31), the familiar zigzag pattern of the yatsuhashi is slightly altered to form a triangle in the center that echoes the shape of the mountain. Iris flowers, usually shown filling the space, are reduced to scattered dots under the prominent bridge. Hokusai has replaced the Heian period (794-1185) ideal of yatsuhashi, usually associated with elegant court nobles and large iris flowers, with a genre scene of the Edo period (1615-1867) showing ordinary people crossing the bridge to pursue their daily activities. Another series, The Hundred Poems Told by the Nurse, about 1835-36, derives from an anthology of one hundred poems by one hundred poets compiled in 1235 by the famous poet Fujiwara no Teika. For some reason the series was never completed; twenty-eight designs are known to exist as prints-twenty-seven color and one black and white-and forty-one designs as hanshita-e are in the Freer Gallery. The title of the series along with the poet's name and poem are presented in a rectangle and a square cartouche, the shapes of the sheets of paper traditionally used for writing poems. Whether workers repairing roof tiles, hunters warming up by a fire, or men rowing boats (pp. 22, below; 24-25; 33, below), the images depicted are not those of the Heian period, but those of Hokusai's own. A Winter Scene, where streaks of smoke are set against a flat mass of black and gray, exemplifies Hokusai's abstract sense of color, shape, and design, as well as his inexhaustible originality-some of the qualities that have given his art its universal appeal.

A man and a woman sit on the floor of the bal- cony resting against boxes containing the images of Kannon, God of Mercy. From The Thirty-six Views of Fuji. OPPOSITE, BELOW: Yoshida on the Tokaido.

The artist carefully laid his slightly moistened final drawing face down on the paste-cov- ered surface of a wood block. When the block and drawing were dry, the carver cut away parts of the block, leaving the lines to be printed in relief. The artist made color notes on monochrome impressions made from this key block. The monochrome impres- sions were used for cutting additional blocks, usually one for each color. On every block kento, or L and horizontal-shape guide marks, were cut to register the colors in the correct position. Pig- ment was brushed on the raised surface of the block and a sheet of paper placed over it. The paper was rubbed with a baren, a circular pad covered with the tough sheath of a bamboo shoot. This pro- cess was repeated for each color. The colors were printed in the order of lighter to darker colors. The gradual shading often seen in representations of sky and water was achieved by wiping the block with a wet cloth and then going over the area with a wet brush dipped in pigment. Special effects, such as embossing, were done last. Y.B. Man riding a donkey. Brush drawing in ink.</page><page sequence="50">w 'I / - I wK W-01' 41-1 gLw. I .
