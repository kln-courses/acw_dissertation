<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reevaluating Frank Norris's Concept of Naturalism:The Summer in Arcady Review Amy Johnson Florida State University Frank Norris, in the 25 July 18% issue of The Wave, wrote a telling review of James Lane Allen's Summer in Arcady: A Tale of Nature (18%), which must be taken into account in any definition of American Literary Naturalism, and particularly Norris's own. Popular conceptions have it that Norris's Naturalism was shaped either by the evolutionary theism espoused by his one-time professor at Berkeley, Joseph Le Conte, or by Zola's pessimistic deterministic materialism. However, close examination of both Arcady and Norris's response to it demonstrates that Norris's theory in 18%, as he worked on McTeague and, most probably, Vandover and the Brute, was not limited by the influence of his French mentor Imile Zola, and further, that his values were quite different from Professor Le Conte's in that they are distinctly non-metaphysical, that is, completely divorced from any theolog- ical or spiritual bent2 Though remarkably deterministic for its time, Arcady would today seem to many relatively innocuous-more a pleasant love idyll with mild erotic overtones than a Naturalistic novel. The central characters, Daphne and Hilary, are two young lovers coming of age in the pastoral setting of Kentucky's hills. Hilary, a hardy, sensuous young man, has a reputation with the ladies, and Daphne's straightlaced father forbids his innocent daughter's involvement with such a rogue. However, the two meet clan- destinely in a pasture where they are, at length, sexually tempted. After numerous meetings, a break-up, and a reunion, they-in a frenzied moment of terror when their lives are threatened by a bull in a neighboring pasture- hastily decide to marry secretly in a small town across the state line. There, unknown to the elopers, Daphne's parents had done the same years before, when they were young and, one infers, similarly susceptible to natural urges. For most of its nineteenth-century audience, Summer in Arcady solicited two readings, the first being that Allen had gone too far in his presentation of desire and sexual awakening. Included in this camp are critics who sternly condemn Allen for mishandling the "sex problem." As one reviewer put it, the author was "too frank on matters of sex."3 While Arcady thus caused some outrage, reviewers in several literary journals favored a second</page><page sequence="2">74 South Central Review reading: that the young could garner from this novel a cautionary lesson, as Daphne and Hilary, despite their temptation, finally control their pas- sion, marry, and thus win a moral victory. The October 18% issue of the Atlantic Monthly, while somewhat tame in its praise, nevertheless hailed Arcady as a tour deforce study of the "power of restraint," that is, restraint of sexual urges. The reviewer then went on to say that "all sorts of morals can be drawn from it, as [Allen] points out in his somewhatbelligerent preface."4 Allen, apparently foreseeing the censorial furor he might encounter, had written a preface in which he argumentatively declared that his book was morally sound, thus inviting reviewers to agree or to plead the opposite opinion. Two, in fact, spent more time discussing the merits of the preface than the work itself. James MacArthur, writing in the June 18% issue of Bookman, asserted that Allen's preface "is in itself one of the most remarkable pieces of literature that we have seen for a long time." After presenting portions of Allen's lamentation over the plight of "fallen women" as repre- sented in contemporaneous fiction, MacArthur quoted Allen again: "We know them too well-these black, chaotic books of the new fic- tion,r--says Mr. Allen in his preface--"know what unhealthy sugges- tions they have courted, what exposures of the eternally hidden they have coarsely made, what ideals of personal depravity they have scat- tered broadcast . . . whatbases of universal decency they havebeen resolute to undermine."5 Clearly, MacArthur--and Allen--saw Arcady as the opposite of these "black, chaotic books" which failed by not depicting the danger of the "evil pas- sions" of human nature, as MacArthur termed them. MacArthur continued: "The hot blasts of passion that find vent in the struggle for supremacy are cooled and quenched by the breath of purity that sweeps down from the height of moral and spiritual beauty upon which [Allen] stands." He concluded with a paean to Allen as a great moral influence: If Mr. Allen, in this new departure, has shown---and we believe he has--that passion in fiction can be made to serve a nobler ethical purpose by his use of the same weapons that are viciously and mischie- vously wielded by other writers, and that an imaginative realism, transfigured by idealism, is nearer to truth in life than a sordid realism allied to animalism, then Summer in Arcady will not have been written in vain.6 If Daphne and Hilary win a moral victory in predictable Victorian terms, i.e., they do not have sex outside of marriage, then similarly does Allen, who has written a veritable sermon, as MacArthur would have it, decrying natural instincts and making attractive the virtue of sexual abstinence before wedlock</page><page sequence="3">Amy Johnson 75 A review from Godey's, on the other hand, condemned the preface. The writer ridiculed Allen's assertion that his characters "wrest a moral victory," and went on to say: "Indeed, the sudden appearance of a wild bull does sober the two young lovers into a hasty marriage; but alas! nick-of-timely cattle are not divinely sent to every tempted couple. So where's the moral, and wherein is it typical?"7 Without the preface, the reviewer noted, Allen's novel would be "only a tender, dreamy idyl." What these idealistic review- ers had in common was that they saw Arcady in terms of a moral concern and measured its didactic success, as did the reviewer for the Overland Monthly in the November 1896 issue. The writer declared that Arcady was, in fact, a "novel of purpose," and continued: "The aim and object of the book is so good, the interest so sustained, the plot so pure, that one does not feel like quarrelling with its author over a certain 'commonness' of expression and use of ordinary descriptive adjectives and trite similes."8 Again, the reviewer quoted from the preface and praised Allen's advice to mothers to warn their daughters of the "commonest dangers," or, seduction. In the 25 July 18% issue of The Wave, one finds a very different tone and rationale for praise. Frank Norris is better than kind, but not for the same reason as MacArthur and his genteel contemporaries. Norris instead fo- cuses upon a kind of realism, even scientism, not noted by the others: Startling enough surely is James Lane Allen's "Summer in Arcady.' It is quite a new note in American fiction. In the portrayal of the loves of Hilary and Daphne Mr. Allen is vitally, one may say, relentlessly true, he is loath to interpose any screen between the reader and the very essence of the bit of human life he is studying. He gets down very close at times. . . . 9 There is no mention of Allen's lofty assertions in the preface, no word of moral victories and the divine, and no discussion of evil passions. Norris continues: There is but little story to the book No attempt at "plot,' that miserable bugbear of authors which has been the ruin of uncounted numbers of good novels. "Arcady" is not a story, it is a picture, a picture of two young people, a whole definite piece cut from the canvas and set down in print Daphne and Hilary meet, fall in love with each other, go through a short courtship and are finally married clandestinely. This is absolutely all, but the manner of treatment, the naturalistic point of view [italics addedloassumed by Mr. Allen makes the book one of the kind that will last Perhaps most surprising for those who have previously read Arcady is Norris's application of the term Naturalism to the novel, which takes place in a verdant pasture, rather than a post-industrial urban setting; the epi- graph on the work's title page is even from Thoreau: "O Nature! . . .</page><page sequence="4">76 South Central Review Some still work give me to do- / Only--be it near to you!" Allen, best known as a local colorist who tended to romanticize the South's agrarian past, seems hardly a candidate for a description usually given to Zolaesque documentarians and hard-boiled delineators of the grimly materialistic, deterministic landscape. However, behind Allen's bucolic setting, Nature is somewhat unsettling, forceful--charged with procreative power. The prelude in Arcady implies an analogy between the human lovers, Daphne and Hilary, and a pair of butterflies, "Weightless little bodies, heavy with Love," which are drawn together "blindly, helplessly, under the transport of all-compelling, un- fathomable Nature!"11 In express relation to the human population, Allen's Nature is a taskmaster who relentlessly drives males and females together, similarly compelling their behavior, as though they are no more "than a couple of fertilizing nasturtiums."12 At the same time, though, Nature is hardly forbidding and deadly; Allen personifies this force as very nearly mischievous, showing up at country picnics and dances where young men and women gather, causing middle- aged farmers in the early summer to "look in" on their wives at work in the dairy.13 Further, while Daphne and Hilary are drawn to one another by the determining forces of Nature, they are not "victims" in the Zolaesque sense: their eventual union is not destructive to either of them, as the marriage proves for the hero and heroine in McTeague. And finally, Allen's message is far from pessimistic. Daphne and Hilary's mutual sexual desire grows into a mature love, but they do not lose their initial passion for one another. Arcady, in short, is very much like Norris's Blix--also not normally viewed as a Naturalistic novel-and was very likely a direct influence on the similar love idyll that Norris composed in 1898-99. However, as noted previously, Norris in 1896 was working on McTeague and, most likely, Vandover and the Brute. Why did he choose to focus on and call "naturalistic" a novel so different from the more Zolaesque manuscripts he then had in hand? In order to trace Norris's motivation for both reading and then reviewing Arcady, it is necessary to go back in time one week, to the 18 July 1896 issue of The Wave. Under the "Communication" section of the weekly magazine appeared a letter to the editor entitled "Realism and Naturalism," written by Bertha Monroe Rickoff, a close friend of the Norris family. Rickoff in her letter is, in fact, responding to a previous Norris article in The Wave entitled "Zola as a Romantic Writer" (27 June 1896), an essay in which Norris argues against the definition of Naturalism as an "inner circle of realism--a kind of diametric opposite of romanticism."14 Realism, he notes, reports nothing more than "things that are likely to happen between lunch and supper." Howells may undertake a "tragedy of a broken teacup," but he is not interested, like Zola, in the broader canvas which may explore the bizarre, unconventional, passionate, and terrible. Norris argues, then, that Naturalism is not synonymous with Realism. Instead, he says that Naturalism is akin to Romanticism, and uses for an</page><page sequence="5">AmyJohnson 77 example Zola, in whose works "everything is extraordinary, imaginative, grotesque even, with a vague note of terror quivering throughout like the vibration of a ominous and low-pitched diapason."' Norris qualifies his point, however, by noting that Zola differs from a purely romantic writer of an earlier era, such as Hugo, mainly in his choice of "Milieu": Zola's dramas take place not among "feudal and Renaissance nobility," but instead in modem conditions among "the people." Therefore, Norris concludes that Zola's art, while emerging from Hugo's tradition, is neither pure, old-style Romanticism nor Howellsian Realism; it finally emerges as "a school by itself, unique, somber, powerful beyond words. It is naturalism."16 In her essay, Rickoff tartly counters some of Norris's premises and his conclusion. Howells is not a Realist, but a "mere materialist," whose work is "incidental, biographical, never real."17 The more probatory and broad- scoped Tolstoi, for her, is the "real" Realist Zola may be a "huge romanti- cist," but he is not a Naturalist--as Rickoff defines the term. Instead, he is a "criminologist," and a "gross materialist" besides. The true Naturalist, it turns out, is James Lane Allen, and Rickoff's interpretation of Arcady pro- vides the significant background against which Norris's quite different ideas, published a week later, stand in high relief. The latter portion of Rickoff's letter follows: It is true that naturalism is the cult of those denying that the processes of nature move by the guidance of a supernatural will from without, but this does not argue that naturalism is the school of what is contrary to nature. Zola's acknowledged aim is to write the history of crime, not the history of nature, and only to the spirits of Dante's inferno could he be justly supposed to paint naturalism. ... With Zola as the huge romanticist, Tolstoi as the realist, and Howells as merely the representative of a passing fad, who is the naturalist, the painter of nature, unaided by the supernatural? Since the discovery of evolution does the supernatural exist apart from the natural? The old conception of God was that of an unsympa- thetic personality, who dwelt in a circle outside the world, and doled out justice with a ladle, while all that was natural fought his decrees in the shape of a homed devil The evolutionists declare God as permeating every atom of the universe, deifying the flesh and making sacred what is natural To them there is no war between God and nature, no natural law which is not one of his holy ordinances. The belief in God, in throwing off the idea of the supernatural finds God as the heart of nature itself. This new type of naturalism greets us in a little book by James Lane Allen called "Summer in Arcady." While Mr. Howells' work is a sur- vival of the puritanism which would put bloomers on the Venus of Milo, while he infers that nature is something for which we must apologize, Mr. James Lane Allen announces that there is nothing in nature which may not be respected, nothing which puritanism is constrained to ignore.</page><page sequence="6">78 South Central Review Mr. Allen is eminently an artist, one to whom may be trusted a subject which would be profaned by grosser handling. While he interweaves the divine quality through nature and human nature he illuminates it and shows it for what it really is. In the quality of pure naturalist Mr. Allen says, "This is love," and in the quality of divine interpreter he adds, "This is sacred."18 Rickoff's article is unconventional by most other contemporary reviews' standards. She does not mention the preface or any moral victories, and she praises Allen for not being a Puritan, for "piercing" through "artificiality" and showing nature and human nature as they really are. In this respect, Norris's article seems closely aligned with Rickoff's, but Rickoff is not content to dwell in the material world. What of her mention of the divine in nature, or the image of nature as divine? While Rickoff seems to describe a Romantic pantheism, she is, in fact, an evolutionary theist, a disciple in line with Joseph Le Conte, the Berkeley professor who sought to synthesize Christian theology and evolutionary principles by rethinking evolution in divinely inspired, melioristic terms: God and nature are one, and all is tending toward some vague, inconceiv- able, yet perfect end. Rickoff is not so far from MacArthur as one might initially conclude, since both subscribe to a moral absolute; when it comes to sexual compulsion, Rickoff's spiritualized Nature is as moral a force as MacArthur's anthropomorphic God on high. Under her rubric, Daphne's and Hilary's sexual attraction for one another is elevated to "divine love." Although Rickoff would seem to describe a unity of flesh and spirit, she filters any semblance of carnal appetite through her own moral vision to create two ethereal, idealized demigods. MacArthur's words, when he speaks of "an imaginative realism, transfigured by idealism," might be Rickoff's own. Norris's uniqueness of interpretation lies in his avoiding any theological, pseudo-theological, or spiritual viewpoint. While Rickoff's article may have spurred Norris to read and review Arcady, he did not make Rickoff's Le Contean leap, as is clear in the concluding remarks of his review. After quoting a passage in which Hilary's sexual desire for Daphne reaches its zenith and is confusedly countered by her fending off his advances after she experiences the effects of her own arousal, Norris declares: In this as in many other passages Mr. Allen strikes the keynote of the book, Daphne and Hilary are little better than natural, wholesome human brutes, drawn to each other by the force of Nature--Mr. Allen spells it with a big N--irresistible, blindly, moved only by an unrea- soned animal instinct. In less skillful hands, the thing might become revolting, with Mr. Allen it is little short of a charming idyll19 Clearly, Norris does not see Allen as a "divine interpreter." To the extent</page><page sequence="7">Amy Johnson 79 that Norris uses the term Naturalism in a Zolaesque sense, he praises Allen's plain, uninhibited frankness regarding human sexuality, his refusal to put up a screen or rose-colored veil between the narrated events and the reader. Allen, then, in assuming the Naturalistic point of view, has peeled away the layers of convention's clothing and probed the human condition truthfully. The result? For Norris, Allen does not find Rickoff's Le Contean manifes- tation of the divine--a sacred being-but instead Zola's human animal, a "natural human brute." However, at least on this occasion, the human brute is not defeated by his animal instincts: he does not find himself at the nadir of a classical Natural- istic descent as he might in Zola's works, or in Norris'sMcTeague or Vandover and the Brute. Here, Norris veritably celebrates the human animal, who is actually "wholesome," but not while standing in a bucolic setting hoeing a garden; this being is wholesome in his "unreasoned animal instinct," specifically, in his sexual desire. But what of the novel's "moral victory" celebrated by some of the review- ers-Daphne and Hilary's marriage? Norris avoids a conclusion which would praise the couple for exercising their free will, containing their sexual desire, and progressing spiritually. True, Hilary and Daphne do not engage in sex before marriage, but Allen does not single them out as exemplary. Instead, he fixes the couple within the broader stream of desperate under- age couples who cross the state line from Kentucky into Ohio to get married. Some of them, like Hilary and Daphne, have narrowly avoided pre-marital sex, but others, pursued by outraged parents, have already given in to sexual desire, and a number of the young women are obviously pregnant Consequently, Norris does not impose a moralistic reading on Daphne and Hilary's marriage; he sees the couple's union not as a well thought-out, coolly deliberate, virtuous decision, but describes it instead as an "impuls- ive, half-terrified elopement"--another instance of largely "unreasoned" natural behavior. Further, if Norris does not see Hilary and Daphne as making a spiritually informed choice, neither does he describe their "blind, instinctive" behavior as indicative of or dictated by divinely inspired evolutionary forces. While Allen's canon taken as a whole invites an idealistic reading of nature and evolution, Arcady, for Norris, does not. Norris, against the Le Contean grain, finds no divine, perfecting force in Allen's novel: quite materially, for good or bad, nature perpetuates life by compelling humans--no less than butterflies and nasturtiums-to mate. To his credit, Allen does not resort to convention in the novel's end by leaving Daphne and Hilary at the altar. He takes the couple past the awkward ceremony among strangers to a moment of pre-honeymoon jit- ters: the innocent Daphne, at last about to lose her virginity, is fearful because of her sexual inexperience. But the closing description of the couple, with Hilary leading Daphne up the stairs to their room, is no less erotic than earlier scenes, and Norris's interest lies in this final passage, not</page><page sequence="8">80 South Central Review the marriage ceremony itself. He says, "It is long since I have come across a stronger, truer, more pitiful picture than this, the closing scene of the book"' For Norris, the couple is not spiritually victorious, but humanly grounded: excited, sexually aroused, yet "pitiful" in their ignorance and nervousness about the ritualistic passage out of innocence into sexual maturity. What emerges, finally, from this long-delayed notice of The Wave review of Arcady is the means of making important qualifications of the contradic- tory, competing popular images of Norris either as an evolutionary idealist or purely pessimistic materialist. If ever Norris had the opportunity to express his alignment with evolutionary theism, Arcady and Bertha Rickoff's interpretation offered him a lead. But Norris did not second Rickoff; his position with regard to Arcady is not dictated by Le Contean ideology. On the other hand, if Norris did not describe Arcady from a post-Darwin- ian theological perspective, neither did he conclude that the human animal is necessarily the bWte humaine so negatively described in Zola's works. Norris himself was obviously not limited by Zolaism; his observations in the Arcady review point to a more expansive concept of Naturalism than a strictly Zolaesque influence would suggest In reviewing Arcady, Norris is a Naturalist who, in contrast to Le Conte and Rickoff, is indeed a materialist; but his view of human nature is a wholly positive one, as positive as Allen's appears to be when he is picturing without censure the inescapable deter- minism that is human sexuality. As do his Blix and The Pit, Norris's review indicates that empiricism need not eventuate in a grim Naturalism. Natu- ralism, for Norris, was the unflinching study of nature which, when viewed as Allen saw it, allowed on occasion for not only a pleasurable acceptance of things-as-they-are, but optimism.
