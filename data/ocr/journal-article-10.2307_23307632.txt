( Religion in North America.) Bloomington: Indiana University Press. 2009. Pp. xiv, 269. Cloth $65.00, paper $24.95. This collection of essays takes on two important tasks. Beyond being a festschrift to honor the work of an un derappreciated scholar of the African American reli gious experience, the volume principally seeks to trace the subsequent genealogy of black religious groups that emerged against the backdrop of the Great Depression and World War II but were largely eclipsed by the bur geoning civil rights movement and the celebratory ethos that accompanied its triumphs in the realm of ra cial desegregation. Secondly, the book endeavors to place the work of Arthur Huff Fauset within the schol arly literature of his time and later periods, drawing les sons from, and asking deeper questions about, the tex ture of various African American spiritual quests during the twentieth century, their connections to each other, and the often problematic orthodoxies that struc tured conventional understandings of religious practice and belief. Fauset is best known in scholarly circles for his book, Black Cods of the Metropolis: Negro Religious Cults of the Urban North. Published in 1944 (and derived from his Ph.D. dissertation in anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania), this work is primarily an ethnographic exploration of the black religious scene of Philadelphia during the 1930s and 1940s. The value of Fauset's study is not limited to his sensitive portrayal of the internal dynamics of various groups, ranging from Noble Drew Ali's Moorish Science Temple (MST) and Father Di vine's Peace Mission to urban iterations of black Ju daism and Pentecostal formations. Indeed, his work is most notable for being among the first to examine al ternative black religious visions on their own terms, un obstructed by burdensome litmus tests concerning their legitimacy or proximity to a presumed Christian nor malcy. As the editors assert, Fauset "inscribed a vision of the modern, cosmopolitan black religious subject" (p. 1). In so doing, he rescued novel expressions of Af rican American spiritual thought and praxis from the exoticizing, marginal realm of presumed primitivism and pathology. As is evident from his text, Fauset was not much concerned with questions about African re tentions or whether his subjects could—or should be expected to—measure up to standards based upon the American Historical Review February 2011</page><page sequence="2">202 Reviews of Books assumed theological rectitude of more conventional black churches. However, he was keenly interested in the spiritual turn that many of these groups repre sented, whether one considers how some (like the Peace Mission) imagined divinity as anthropomorphic and flesh bound or how others (such as "Black He brews" and "Moorish-Americans") appropriated and elaborated upon the meaning of what it meant to serve Allah or to be an observant Jew. This volume is divided into two parts. The first sec tion contains essays on the six movements that Pauset originally examined, updating much of his research with recent scholarship and insightful impressions that re veal his methodological innovations and scrutinize some of his less compelling assertions and omissions. Clarence E. Hardy Ill's chapter on church mothers draws upon unpublished research by Fauset to fore ground the role of women in gendering a northern Pen tecostalism that sprang from deep southern roots. Danielle Brune Sigler's piece on Daddy Grace and the United House of Prayer of All People amply displays two of the guiding themes of the book: first, that Grace (like W. D. Fard of the Nation of Islam and Noble Drew Ali of the MST) attempted to construct an internation alized messianic role for himself, stressing his foreign travels, heritage, and diasporic relevance, and second, that Grace—and others—inserted himself into the in terstices between humanity and God, sometimes claim ing the mantle of the latter. Taking this discussion even further, the essay by Jacob S. Dormán elaborates upon the existence of an Orientalist sensibility among early twentieth-century African Americans that encom passed the assorted manifestations of black Judaism, black Islam, Rastafarianism, and spiritualism and that offered a "counter-discourse that critiqued American racism and the discourse of civilization by exoticizing the self" (pp. 117-118). Put another way, black Orien talists were less preoccupied with consciously showcas ing demonstrably African cultural forms and were more inclined to invent new signifying matrices that used (imagined) African folkways as a foil as well as mystical Eastern (or "Asiatic") elements that seemingly drama tized their esoteric, non-Western llavor. Edward E. Curtis IV's essay on the MST similarly complicates any pat notions of Islamic orthodoxy, accentuating the im portance of context and doctrinal change over time. His primary point is that Noble Drew Ali, the founder of the MST, could have come to his understanding of Islam via any of an array of entry points during the early twen tieth century, none of them requiring that he—or later researchers—embrace a "textbook" definition of what it meant to be a Muslim. The second, shorter part of the volume, comprising five chapters, is more concerned with placing Fauset and his contemporaries—such as Melville J, Herskovits and E. Franklin Frazier—in conversation within disci pi ine-specific discourses. In this vein, Sylvester A. John son's piece fruitfully tests Fauset's methodology and findings against a number of scenarios. Consequently, his contribution to the volume is twofold. First, he makes provocative comparisons between African American religious experiences in the United States and postcolonial instances elsewhere, deeming religion itself a "colonial category" and locating the history of American Christianity in an abiding disdain of African belief systems. Additionally, Johnson, more explicitly than the other contributors, advances the possibility of the existence of black religion-based ethnicities, disag gregated from the totalizing language and burdened ex perience of race and akin to the imaginings and inter play of ethnic identities among whites. Kathryn Lofton's essay brings into sharper focus the notion of primitivism as being the fountainhead of African Amer ican religion, incorporating an intriguing discussion of Fannie Lou Hamer as the subject of a historiography of gendered assumptions interlaced with projections of the primal and premodern. Carolyn Rouse's venture into contemporary Islamic expressions in Los Angeles further underscores how gender shapes religious con victions and longings, which are, in turn, often condi tioned by depressing socio-economic realities that deepen the relational alienation of black men and women. The volume concludes with essays by Kelly E. Hayes and Stephen W. Angelí that, respectively, exam ine Afro-religious culture in Brazil and the historical debate between Herskovits and Frazier regarding the extent and importance of African cultural carryovers among blacks in the Americas. Overall, the essays in this collection offer a fresh, thoughtful look into African American religious com munities outside of the Christian mainstream. The au thors and editors are true to their claims that their work underscores the significance of Fauset's landmark study, the need to position black religious experiences in a transnational frame, and the imperative that al ternative spiritual visions not be blurred by the dismis sive optic of any presumed doctrinal orthodoxy, Chris tian, Islamic, or otherwise. The shortcomings of this volume are few but noteworthy. The first part of the book is notably stronger in its attention to Fauset as well as its intellectual claims about African American religions. With the exceptions of the chapters by John son and Lofton, the second part of the book strays both in topical focus and argumentation. Additionally, given the myriad personalities discussed and imagery evoked, the volume would have benefited greatly from the in clusion of pictures and other visual representations of the subject matter. Notwithstanding these observa tions, this is a commendable collection that should en courage and inform subsequent study. Claude Clegg Indiana University, Bloomington</page></plain_text>
