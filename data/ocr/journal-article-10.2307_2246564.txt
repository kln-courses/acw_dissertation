<plain_text><page sequence="1">IV.-MARCUS AURELIUS AND THE STOIC PHILOSOPHY. IT costs us some effort to realise the full importance of philo- sophy to the Greek or Roman citizen who had received a liberal education. For him it combined in one whole body of doctrine all the authority and iifluence which nowadays are divided, liot without contention, by science, philosophy, and religion in varying shares. It was not an intellectual exercise or a special study, but a serious endeavour to gather up the results of all humnan knowledge in their most general form, and make themn available for the practical conduct of life. We know that Greek philosophy had its full share in the bloodless victories won by Greece over her conquerors; and that the Stoic systemi was especially congenial to the Roman character, and had a con- siderable miajority of adherents among cultivated Rolnans. We know that the lives of illustrious rulers and statesmen, and of him not least among them of whom there is presently more to be said, were formed upon the discipline of that system; and if evidence is ever to be trusted to connect men's actions and character with their professed beliefs, we have abundant and trustworthy evidence in this case. These facts are almost too colmlmonplace for express menition; but it is perhaps not so easy to remember, what nevertheless is undeniable, that for every name which has made Stoicismi remarkable in history, there must have been maniy, now scarcely noted or wholly forgotten, among the inen who did the abiding work of the Roman empire in provinces where the follies and revolutions of the palace had little effect. I have called their work abiding, for it is to be remembered that Rome not only kept peace and order througyhout an immense dominion inhabited by all races and con- ditions of men, and governed some parts of the world infinitely better than they have been governed before or since, but set a stamp on the whole frame of the civilised world which in miany respects remains to this day. The Stoic philosophy was in no</page><page sequence="2">48 Marcus A ureliuts and the Stoic Philosophy. small measure the source of the moral influences under which this work was done. Moreover, its hand can be distinctly traced in the development of legal conceptions and of the law itself. It is therefore a matter of considerable interest to understand how Stoicism presented itself to the men in whose hands its teaching bore such fruit; nor is this altogether so easy as might be supposed, for it is one thing, to have the tenets of a system laid down in works of professed exposition or discussion, and another thing, to seize those elements which really commend the system to those who adopt it in practice. In the case of Stoicism we have abundant accounts of its theory, but for the most part at second-hand. Nothing, has come to us straight from the founders or leaders of the original Greek school. In the latter time Seneca can hardly be counted for more than a retailer. Of Epictetus we have only notes and reminiscences put into shape after his death; and Epictetus, after all, is an official preacher. And this increases the difficulty of rightly apprehending the real working contents of the Stoic philosophy. But the difficulty is lhappily much lessened by our possession of an almost unique piece of evidence-the note-book of an emperor who was likewise a philosopher, or at least a very apt learner in philosophy. The Commentaries of M. Aurelius Antoninus, as the editions call them for the want of a better name, have all the appearance of notes freely set down for the writer's own use, and without any thought of publication. Tlhey are constantly abrupt, unfinished, or hardly gramnmatical; some passages are evidently mere jottings of topics for further writing or reflection, the exact meaning of which can be 1only guessed at. How or when they were first made public is not known. We haave here, then, the substance of the Stoic philosoplly con- sidered as a working rule of life, and so considered by a disciple whose opportunities of testing it could not well be surpassed. For although it is commonly taken for granted that men's moral principles are best judged in adversity, one may well doubt whether a position of great eminence and weighty duties does not put them to a more perfect trial. In Marcus Aurelius, then, it seems to me that we may find tlle safest guide to the knowledge of the Stoic morality in its practical. aspect and in its relation to the general system of which it was part. The intrinsic beauty of the morality set forth by him, both in -substance and in temper, has been con- stantly adinired; but we are apt to forgret that Marcus Aurelius was not a solitary apparition of virtue, but the disciple and representative-an illustrious one, no doubt-of a settled and widely-spread doctrine. And this doctrine, notwithstanding its singularities, or sometimes by reason of them, comes nearer to</page><page sequence="3">M arcus Aurelius and the Stoic Philosophy. 49 our -own ways of thinking, and has more lessons for us, than appears at first sight. Before we examine any specific points of the Stoic philosophy, it may be as well to pause and see what were its aims. It is in some sense true that all philosophers are in search of the same end; yet it is in practice very difficult for a philosopher even to announce his object without showing what method he intefids to follow and what sort of results he expects to get. Now the objects of the Stoics were eminently practical; they strongly held that knowledge is for the sake of action, and that the worth of philosophy consists in its power to guide the conduct of life. Among other illustrations and comparisons which seem not very pointed to a modern taste they likened philosophy to a fertile field, logic to the fence round it, and ethics to the crop grown in it. They further said that the knowledge by which action is to be guided is a knowledge derived from experience; and they said it in terms which fixed no bounds to the possible bearing of experience and knowledge upon action, Chrysippus, who was considered to have settled the Stoic system in its finished form, is reported to have stated his ideal of life to this effect :-" A virtuous life is4the same thing as a life agreeable to experience of what happens in the course of nature; for the nature of each of us men is part of the nature of the world." 1 How the Stoics conceived of experience we learn from Plutarch; experience, they said, is by the multitude of similar (or uniform) perceptions.2 Thus the knowledge that is to serve us in life is founded on an observed order of things, which order is thought of as something belonging to the whole world, and equally present in every part of it. Now this is exactly such a general conception of knowledge as in these times is growing upon us as we become more familiar with the methods and results of science. And we have here no mere verbal coincidence gathered from scattered sentences; the testimonty of M. Aurelius will show that the parallel is a real one. The conception of the world as orderly does not only lie at the root of the Stoic system, and explain, as will presently be seen, many of the things that appear strangest in it; we find it constantly treated as some- tling to be kept actively present in the mi-nd, and capable of affording present support and guidance. This it does in two ways: the first bearing immediately upon action, the other more remotely, but not less steadily, through contemplation. First, a "Ritter and Preller, list. UGrce. et Rorn.

It points out to us not indeed duty itself, but the conditions of our duties. It cannot tell us what our actual duties are; that depends on the specific character of man as distinct from other creatures, and more especially -upon his social nature. But it can guide us in judging the circumstances and consequences of which we must be in possession in any particular case before we can tell what is really the question of conduct that arises; it does not solve moral problems, but enables us to know what we are about in settling their data. 'See whither nature leads you, the universal nature by means of that which happens to you, your own by means of that which you have to do." 1 Obstacles and difficulties present themselves to man's intentions; but he has reason given him that he may find out what is the best thing practicable, and do that; nay, reason has the power to compel the stubborn things of the world to her own ends, as fire con- verts all sorts of fuel to itself. A right purpose guided by right tunderstanding cannot be really disappointed. But this is hardly so important as the more contemplative aspect of the universal order, which is dwelt upon by Marcus Aurelius wirth striking force and frequency. The mind that learns to recognise a fixed order and connexion in the changing appearances of the world also learus to take a certain intellectual pleasure in that order considered in itself, apart from the pleasurable or useful character of its operations in their particular effects. Every- thing has a fitness in its own place, and almost everything may thus be a source of- contemplative pleasure to him " who has become truly familiar with nature and her works ".-3 Again, all things are ever changing and passing away; one comes in another's place and no single thing endures. Perpetual clhange and renewal is the first law of nature, and everything is in a- manner but the seed of that which shall be made of it ; existence is a river in constant flow, a torrent sweeping every- thing before it; the operations of all forces consist in manifold 1 Marcus Aurelius, VII. 55.

We may therefore think of ourselves as belonging to the whole order of the world and bring ourselves into a certain sym-pathy with it. And this habit of thouglht will help us to lift ourselves above the common passionis that vex us with surprise and discontent wlhen events fa.ll out so as to cross our individual desires. Nothing can befall us that is not in the nature of things capable of being understood and reckoned with, and it is our business to master circumstances by understanding them.4 As for those things which it is not in the power of man to alter or avoid, we are to accept them as being part of that order in which we ourselves are a part, and in wlhich all things, however wide asunder in seeming, are in truth conjoined, and work together for the whole.5 " Consider the courses of the stars as one running the sanie course with them, and think constantly upon the chaniges of the elements into one another; for by the perception of these things the grossness of our life on earth is purged away:7" " nothing is so fitted as this to beget highmindedness."6 Thus we are led to one of the features which is- most prominently put forward by the Stoics, at any rate by Marcus Aurelius, in setting forth the ethical ideal. Not only does the fruit of skill and understanding belong to the mind that knows the beginning anid end of things, and the reasoln that pervades and rules all existence; 7 not only does the wise man acquiesce in the decrees of the universal order, knowing that they cannot be otherwise; hev meets events with a contented and cheerful assurance, and his maxim is " to welcome everything that happens ".8 Whatever comes to us, however hard it may seem, I V. 23; IX. 29; XEI/tappovg v/ 7&amp;- o'Xwv ov'oa 7ravTa 0/'pet. 2 VII. 18. 3 VII. 25 ; XII. 23.

If we repine at anything that happens in the course of nature, we are striving, so far as in us lies, to maim the perfection and unity of the world.' So that the rightly instructed man will say to Nature, the giver and taker of all things: "Give what thou wilt: take what thou Wilt."2 Epic- tetus bade his hearers never to say that they had lost anything, but that they had returned it.3 And Marcus Aurelius, going far beyond simple resignation or acquiescence, lifts up his voice in a hymn of adoration (for onle can hardly call it otherwise) which is among the most remarkable utterances of ancient philosophy. " Evervthing harmonises with me which is harmolnious to thee, 0 Universe. Nothiing for me is too early or too late which is in due tinme for thee. Everything, is fruit to me which thy seasons bring, 0 Nature; from thee are all things, in thee are all things, to thee all things return. The poet says, Dear city of Cecrops; and wilt not thou say, Dear city of Zeus ? " 4 The last words bring out the speculative foundation of that cosmopolitan character which has always been remarked as prominent in the Stoic system. The Stoics shared, however, with other post-Aristotelian schools a strong cosmopolitan tendency, which is accounted for by the social and political circumstances of the time, and in particular by the decay of local independence, and therewith of the old Greek patriotism, coinciding with a great enlargement of commerce and inter- course between different parts of the world. It is not m-ly purpose to enter on the task of comparing Stoicism with modern philosophies. But one cannot help being struck by the resemblance of the line of speculation which I have just endeavoured to trace in M. Aurelius, and which seems to me to have been a very central one with the Stoics, to that which is struck out by 'Strau2s in his latest work. English readers may find an even closer parallel to the Stoic nature- worship in 'a place where few, perhaps, would think of looking for it; I mean in Mr. Swinburne's Songs before Sutnrise. It will be observed that the mood of reverent acquiescence, or something more, with which a Stoic looked upon the order of the universe includes elements which do not seem to belong to a purely scientific contemplation. As yet we have not taken account of tlhese, although the foregoing statement could not be kept clear of thein. The Stoics had, indeed, the conception of natural order as a thing ascertained by experience, and worth 1 V. 8. 2 X. 14. 3 Epict., Ench. 11. 4 IV. 23 ( Mr. Long's translation).</page><page sequence="7">Marcus Aurelius and tahe Stoic Philosophy. 53 knowing and making the best of simply because it is there and cannot be otherwise. But they sought to reinforce this idea by a creed of dogmatic pantheism with wlhich their doctrine of the Kosmos was closely knit. And this pantheism was associated with, and to a large extent rested upon, a no less dogmatic teleology. Some, at least, of the Stoic leaders appear to have pushed their reflections .on final causes into details which nowadays must appear ludicrous to every one. I do not nmean that these dogmas Were adopted of set purpose; existing hablts of thought and language must have suggested them with almost irresistible force. " Qui dit loi dit ordre; qui dit ordre dit finalite: tous ces termes s'impliqnent logiquement," says a writer of our own day.1 To a Greek all this was implied in the one word Kosmos, as M. Aurelius does not fail to note. The Stoics asserted that the world is a product of reason, and that all the laws of nature aim in the long run at reasonable ends. That which partakes less of reason exists for the sake of that which has a greater share of it; so that, without saying exactly that the world was made for man, a Stoic might easily take an anthropomorphic, or rather anthropocentric view of it. Again, the earlier Stoics were not content with the uniformity of nature as an observed similarity of results in similar condi- tions, but by a strangely fantastic addition they imagined the conditions themselves as recurring on a vast scale. They held, in common with the Pythagoreans, that the world is periodically destroyed and regenerated. Internal evidence and tradition both tend to show that the Pythagoreans got this doctrine, together with that of the transmigration of souls, from India. It is true that the details of the Pythagorean teaching are not sufficiently known. But both doctrines are set forth at some length in mythical fashion by Plato; the recurring cycles of the world's life in the Politicus, the transmigration of souls in the Phcedrus. And in both places, especially the latter, the points of likeness to Indian belief are almost too many to be accounted for by coiincidence. Probably both Plato and the Stoics bor- rowed from the Pythagoreans, though M. Aurelius exhibits one curious coincidence in detail with the language of Hindu philosophy which suggests at least a possibility of later inde- pendent communications with 'the East.2 Be this as it may, I M. E. Vacherot, in Revue des deux Mondes, Aug. 1, 1876, p. 503. 2 "t One is the sun's light, though dispersed by walls, mountains, and other things without number.

The simile of the sun is a comnmoniplace of Indian philosophic poetry, and may have</page><page sequence="8">54 Marcus Aurelius and the Stoic Philosophy. the Pythagoreans, followed by the Stoics, proceeded to better their instructors (whoin they had perhaps misunderstood) by asserting that not only was the world to be destroyed and renewed when the perfect period of all things, or annus magnus, should be fulfilled, but that the former conditions were to be, exactly reproduced, and the whole course of events repeat itself in the mninutest details. (This is not only foreign to the Brahman cosmocrony, but inconsistent with it.) The only modern parallel I can now call to mind is in a book of no special philosophical pretensions, entitled Peter Simple, where Mr. Muddle, the carpenter, assures the captain, with unconsci- ous Stoicism, that he found the very same fault with him on that same quarter-deck 27,672 years ago. Among the later Stoics, Panaetius and some others rejected this absurdity; but there is nothing to warrant the belief, which one would be glad to entertain if one could, that Marcus Aurelius did so. He alludes to the doctrine several times without dissent, anld with only'such slight indications of doubt as to leave it possible that he may have thought the question an open one, but of no practical importance.' Again, thereis another quite distinct kind of reflection which is apt to be mixed up with the scientific- notion of uniformity, and may even simulate it in expression. Moralists of almost every age and school have dwelt upon the common and mono- tonous character of human life as a reason for not setting one's heart on the usual objects of (lesire. " There is nothing new under the sun." This commonplace is certainly to be found in M. Aurelius,2 and when he says that he who has seen the present has also seen the boundless past and future,3 and speaks elsewhere to the like effect, he may mean dnly to repeat the same thing; and very possibly the official teaching of Stoicism put it forward as a deduction from the idle fancy just noticed. Still one is tempted to think he had in his mind the greater conception of an order without assignable bounds in time or space, so complete and unbroken that from a perfect know- become known to the Greeks. But the Stoic pantheism has in the main very little in common with that of the Hi-ndus. 1V. 13, 32; VII. 19; IX. 28; X. 7; XI. 1; in VII. 19, )ro0'ov9 t 0 ahwv Xpvw7rovV, 7rJGov9 'ET7riKTYrOVY Ka7T7r67rwICE; mUay only mean, as far as the words go, " HoWs many such as Chrysippus and Epictetus have lived and died ".

Certainly in another passage he seems to imnagine a " reign of law," as we now say, botlh in the co- existence and in the succession of things. There is a rational connexion, he says, in the sequence of events; it is not like a mere enumeration of particulars in an arbitrary order.' M. Aurelius appears to affirm, again, that either there is no reason at all in the world (and for him, as a Stoic, reason and order are synonymous), or everything that happens must be the determinate result of an original and universal order: but the passage is far from clear.2 It is worth noting that his concep- tion of uniformity, whatever it was, applied no less to human affairs and conduct than to any other class of events.3 This is no more than one would expect, as the Stoic, philosophy is well known from other sources to have been wholly determinist.4' The technical name for the necessity or universal law governing the world was 6eijapp,qrn. "Fatu-m autem id appello," says Cicero, abridging or paraphrasing, as it seems, from the Stoic Posidonius, "quod Graeci c4lap,pevflv, id est ordinem seriemque causarum cum causa causae nexa rem ex se gignat. Ea est ex omni aeternitate fluens veritas semnpiterna. Quod cum ita sit, nihil est factum, quod non fiuturum fuerit, eodemque modo nihil est fliturum, cuius non causas id ipsum efficientes natura contineat." 5 It is remarkable that this general tone of cosmical and scientific contemplation did not bring the Stoics into conflict with the popular creed. Not only did they offer no opposition to the rites, observances, and superstitions of the unlearned, but they even found reasons in their philosophy to support them. Especially they defended the art and mystery of diviination long after it had become the subject of doubt or open disbelief else- where; and they attempted to give their defence the appear- ance of a serious argument on scientific grounds. Their system forbade them to affirm special interferences with the course of nature, such as signs and wonders were commonly esteemed. The events foretold by omens and victims were indeed, they said, unchangeable and determined from the first, as links in the chain of an eternal order. But the omens and victims were 1 IV. 45.

The fact of the connexion was abundantly established by experience; and as for the part of the gods in the matter, they did not change the order of things, but knew the hidden causes and signs of events better thati men, possessing as they did a higher intelligence; and what could be more natural and reasonable than that they should be moved by goodwill to man to impart some of their knowledge to him ? Arguments were constructed exhibiting the truth of divination as at necessary deduction from the existence of gods: 2 a-nd the prophecies of the soothsayer were represented as analogous to the scientific predictions of the astronomer. The Stoics would not have found much to learn, apparently, from the defenders of sundry pseudo-scientific positions in later' days. On this point Paneetius again stands out in honourable dissent; he ventured (to the no small scandal of his colleagues) to cast doubt on the efficacy of divination.3 We have yet to remark 'the greatest speculative paradox of the Stoic philosophy. It exalted Reason as tlhe source of the world's order, the one ruler and judge of all things, the sole fountain of good to every creature, and especially the sole origin and measure of morality for man. And at the same time it was frankly, nay grossly materialist; no whit less so than the rival school of Epicurus, and probably more so than any modern school has been. The Stoics asserted in set terms that nothing really exists but matter, and that the soul is material (oi4ta ' rvxv4).4 -Even the world-soul, which they identified with Zeus or the supreme God, was regarded as a kind of finer matter endowed with special qualities of penetration and -diffusion- tlhe elemental fire as they sometimes called it. They would have hailed the luminiferous ether as an even more valuable contribution to theology than to physics. To give one concrete example of this materialism, Marcus Aurelius gravely notes andI considers the question (not unhkely to have been a current one) how there can be room in the air for all the souls of the dead ? 6 I am not aware that either the materialism or the superstition of the Stoics had any sensible effect on their ethical doctrines or practice; but it was impossible to onmit mention of these things, as the omissioni might have been misleading. It is likewise hardly possible to forbear noticing the signal example 1 Cicero, op. cit., I. 118. 2 Cie., op. cit., I. 82, II. 101. 3 Cie., op. cit. I. 6.

I IV. 21.</page><page sequence="11">Mancus Aureius ancj the Stoic Philosophy. 57 here given of the danger there is in affecting to hold either schools or particular men to what are called the logical conse- quences of their opinions. We hear a good deal nowadays of the mischievous tendencies of materialism anid pantheism, and their incompatibility with a high moral ideal; and this not only from those who scatter materialism and pantheism as vague terms of abuse, but from men who have a distinct mean- ing for their words. In the philosophy of the Porch we find that, as a matter of fact, a most lofty and ideal morality- which indeed so much abhorred all weakness, compromise, and condescension, that it has earned even with a wise and generous historian the reputatioil of being harsh and impracticable- was associated with both pantheism and materialism in their crudest forms. We also hear a good deal of the absolute necessity of the doctrine of free-will (that is, causeless volitions) for the support and the very existence of morality: those who use such lanauage surely forget that Marcus Aurelius, in common with all the moralists of his school, was an uncompro- mising determninist. It would seem that on the whole it is more or less unsafe to rely on aniy supposed necessary connexion between metaphysics and morals. It is true that the Stoics conceived matter itself, or at least that which composed the finer elements, to be in its own nature active, so that their physics, as Zeller puts it, were dynamical rather than mechanical. And it may also be said that the contrast between materialism and idealism bad not then been sharply defined as it is now. They may be said therefore, in a certaini sense, not to have been pure materialists.' But the same may be said, for the same or other reasons, of most of the writers to whom the name is applied in modern times. The ethical theory of the Stoics can be understood only by keeping in mind its connexion with the general view of the world of which we have endeavoured to give some sketch. Taken by itself, the language of their fundamental maxims is exceedingly vague; and some well-known expositions of them, which are cl"assical as literature but of secondary rank in philo- sophy, may be vague elnough to justify the surprise and even contempt expressed by some modern writers. " Live according to Nature" is, at first sight the most ambiguous of precepts. But the Stoics had a definite meaning, for it, and were at some pains to explain it. Tley held, as we lhave seen, that every- thing is subject to one universal order, which is itself settled by, or rather is conceived as being, a supreme and all-pervading intelligence. This order being determinate and irresistible, 1 Lange, Gesch. des Materialdimus, I. 72, 2nd ed.</page><page sequence="12">58 Marcus Aurelius and the Staic Philosophy. every agent and event in some way or other fulfils it. Even those who think to hinder it are against their own conceit working for it, and we may say of them "Of these too the world had nieed ".i On this ground there is obviously no founidation for ethical distinctions. But when we so far quit this universal point of view as to conisider any particular species in relation to the whole, we see that it has certain constant relations to the rest of the world, which in fact determine its specific character, and which in the case of living creatures the life of the species is occupied in maintaining. Every creature has some normal function as part of the general order of the Kosmos ;2 what those functions are for each kind, is to be ascertained by experience. They must always include, however, the preserva- tion of the species; otherwise it could not exist as a species: thus the impulse of self-preservation, which the Stoics ascribed to every creature as the first spring of action, is not only common, as a matter of fact, to all active beings, but is an integral part of the common order of the world. Every act of an individual which belongs to the proper function of its species as thus understood is, in the Stoic language, according to Nature as regards that species, that. is, according to its specific nature (ta (bvatos?); and inasmuch as it is an instance of the general law which fixes the normal place and action of the species in the great concert of the Kosmos, it is also said to be in an eminent manner according to Nature, taken in the general sense as the universal order (Icowi) Oblo-s). Now man, as well as other creatures, has his specific function, or nature in the Stoic sense, as part of the cosmical plan. But, unlike other creatures, he can fulfil it with conscious intelligence and choice. He may know his station in the world, and know also that in -main- taining it he is fulfilling the purpose of the supreme Reason. By the very fact of being addressed to an understanding agent the comnmand " Live according to Nature " becomies " Live according to Reason." This reason, as expressed in the consti- tution of man and his relations to the world, his capacities, his achievements, and his aspirations, furnishes a type or pattern of life which mav be sufficiently known by those who choose to model their conduct upon it. Actions conformable to this type are morally right, and rightmindedlness is the conscious striving to attain it (we neglect for the moment tlle minuter points of Stoic doctrina); it is in this sense th-at moral goodness is the fulfilment of man's proper nature. The architect or, the plhysician has his proper art, which, if he is competent in it, he conducts accordiing to fixed principles; but every man, simply 1 VI. 42. 2 C TOV 7rpO!g (1 IYEOVEV, VIII. 19.</page><page sequence="13">Marcus Aurelius and the Stoic PAilosopky. 59 as a man, is in the same case; and man, like every other creature, is judged by his fitness for the work for which he is destined.2 " What is your business in the world,? To be good."3 This then is the- calling imposed upon man by the supreme Reason; a fact to be observed which implies a law to be obeyed. Righteousness consists in fulfilling the duties imposed by it with a cheerful obedience of discipline.4 Some points must be noted here in which the Stoics differed much from the moralists of later times, not so much in their solution of ethical problems as in their conception of the problems themselves and of the province of ethics as a science. A modern reader is tempted to ask where is the sanction in the Stoic scheme of morality? How does it answer the question which some regard as the very first that moral philosoplhy is bound to answer-why should I do righit? It may seem strange to us, but so it is, that the Greek philosophers, and especially the Stoics, troubled themselves very little to filnd a direct reply. The question seems hardly to have occurred to them in that form; they rather assumed that a doctrine of ethics is addressed to learners who are in the miain wiling to be taught, and it is far from certain that they were wrong in so doing. It may be fairly doubted whether it is the business of moral philosophy to establish the existence of its own subject-matter. There is no topic on which one may not bring argument to a standstill by pushing obstinate denial far enough; anid it may be that a man who will not admit that there is such a thing as moral duty thereby removes himself out of the reach of philosophy, and is amenable (supposing his opinion to be sincerely held and acted upon) only to other kinds of discipline. After all, the modern way of supporting the moral law with sanctions only puts the difficulty back; for what if a per'verse mrian should say, I do not care for your -sanction ? We know that the most stringent sanctions have in fact been deliberately set at defiance on several occasions. Do we say, then;- that sanctions are of no account ? Certainly not; their part in a historical inquiry concerning the growth of morality, or in the colnsideration of the state of morals existing at any given time and place, is of the utmost importance; but this belongs to the practical side of the matter, and does not show that duty can be exhibited by way of logical demonstration to any recalcitrant individual. But to return to the Stoics: whether it was a real -1 VI. 35.

In Marcus Aurelius there is very little about the consequences of right or wrong actions to the individual agent. It is worth mentionina, however, that in one passage of Epictetus we find a clear enough expression of what is now called the sanction of self-esteem.' He distinctly says that we are to weigh against the enjoyment of a present pleasure, on the one hand the future pain of repentance and self-reproach, on the other hand the future pleasure of a satisfied conscience. And the Stoics asserted no less stoutly than any one else, even the Epicureans, that virtue is the only true happiness, though they denied that virtue is morally preferable because it gives happi- ness. Even this, however, is not prominent in Marcus Aurelius; and it is needless to repeat here that the Stoics required virtue to be above all things disinterested. One instance may be given: "When thou hast done a good act and another has received it, why dost thou still look for a third thing besides these, as fools do, either to have the reputation of having done a good act or to obtain a return." 2 Of the optimism of their ethics we must say a word maore presently. Now this assumption, which I think is tacitly made all through the Stoic teaching. namely, that there is such a thing as a rule of right conduct binding one man as well as another, and that the average man, so far at any rate as philosophy has to deal with him, is willing to follow that rule if it is properly explained to him-brings us almost at once to the famous Socratic position, that virtue can be taught; or obversely, that vice is mere ignorance. If (among the nations which have produced philosophers at all evenits) men were not on the whole able and willing to do right oftener than not, it is difficult to see how moral philosophy would be possible. In so far as a man is able and willing to do, right, he can do wrong only by, mistake or misapprehension; and it is readily perceived that much wrong has been and is done in the world for pure want of knowledge. The Stoics, dwelling' exclusively upon this view, referred all wrong-doing to this head; and the doctrine had great practical importance in their school, as we see in Marcus Aurelius, as anl argument for patience and equanimity in bearing misbehaviour at the hands of one's fellow-men. Reflect, he says in substanice, that it is the deed of your fellow and kins- man, not knowing the law of his own nature ; 3 ask yourself what is his mistake; 4 his wrong is in truth involuntary; 5 it is IEpict.

Once it is said, " It is proper to man to love even offienders." 4 Again, the immortal gods have to put up with worthless men through all time, and take it nlot amiiss; how much more then shall you endure them for a little lifetime, being even such an one yourself ? 5 From this digression, which seemed needful by way of explanation, we go back to the positive conception of morality as held by the Stoics. Virtue does not, in their view, consist in action directed consciously to the attainment of some ulteriorf advantage, but in the normal and healthy exercise of an active function6 belonging to the proper constitution of man as a species (Wi1a 06o-t9). The question then presents itself, what is this specific constitution ? What are the characteristic qualities of man that make him a moral being ? The answer, often and in many forms reiterated in the teaching and writing of the school, is that man is reasonable and social; there is no lack of other authorities on this point, but the constant occurrence of the topic in Marcus Aurelius is significant as confirming them. Here again it is to be observed how the Stoics made use of their cosmical and teleological ideas as a background for ethical theory. The world itself being conceived as rational, and man being the eminently rationial creature, the agreement of man's i8t'a Ob6o-t9 with the Kotvy fV'o-t, or general law of the universe, is presented with an air of self-evidence.7 It is likewise assumed as axiomatic (so at least it appears in Marcus Aurelius) that the only rational life for man is a social life. When man consults his reason it clearly and imperatively bids him live with his fellow-men; human reason itself is constantly called social (X6ro9 KOtIJr1Jlt/wc69, sometimes 7TOXt7KOt). "He is a deserter who abandons the social reason. . . he is a fragment tdrn from society who tears his own soul from the 1 VIII. 14. 2 VI. 57. 3 X. 4; XI. 11; XI. 18 (in this last passage most of the precepts for such occasions are summed up). 4 VII. 22. 5 VII. 70; compare with this the legend of Abraham and the fire- worshipper. 6 The man of souind judgment perceives that his own good lies in his own activity (lt'av vpaCt6.v), VI. 51. 7 For the reasonable animal (man) action " according to nature" and "according to reason " are identical, VII. 1 1.</page><page sequence="16">62 Marcus Aurelius and the Stoic Philosophy. sou-l of reasonable creatures, which is one." ' As will be seen by this last quotation, the pantheism of which we have-already spoken is brought in to give a metaphysical reason for the social bond; the souls of men being conceived as pieces or quantities of the same stuff. Man is social, and is entitled to sociable treatmnent at the hands of his fellow-man because he is reason- able.2 Each man is to the community as a member to an organism, not s a mere part to an aggregate; 3 so the man who com-nmits an unsocial action is a mutilator of the body politic, in that he cuts himself off from it; but, as Marcus Aurelius or hiis original quaintly, yet finely, adds, the limbs of this body have the special gift of being able to reunite theinselves to it.4 Further, as a branch cut off from the next branch must needs be cut off from the whole tree, so a man at strife with his neighbour is cut off from the whole fellowship of men.5 The whole of man's action is to be directed to social ends, and to the good of his fellow-men,6 and such action, being the exercise of man's proper energy and the fulfilment of his truest nature, is its own sole and sufficient reward. Does the eye seek a recom- pense for seeing or the feet for walking? Likewise the mnan who has done aught towards the common weal has done that which he is set in the world to do, and in doing it receives his own.7 It is even said that every deed that does not bear directly or remotely on the chief end of the common welfare is of the nature of dissension and sedition.8 One passa(ge, in which the duty of sociableness is enforced, first by various sup- posed physical analogies in the elemeents, and then by the example of the gregarious and social animals, concludes with the remark that no man can be wholly unsocial even if he tries: nature is too strong.9 It is said, too, that the ruling principle in man's constitution is that of society.'0 In all this there is at the same time a notable absence of any distinct reference to political activities and duties; the city. from which all the older Greek ideas of religion- and morality took their spring and strength has become expanded to the bounds of the inhabited world, and man owes duties to his neighbour, not as his fellow- citizen, but as his fellow-mlan.

'63 though both its origin and its development exhibit clear signs of weakness. But in considering the effect of Stoicismh on the Roman world it is proper to bear in mind that the feeble side of its cosmopolitan doctrine was just that to which a Roman disciple accustomed to take part in affairs of state would be likely to bring sufficient correction from his own resources. A Roman commander or administrator guarding the frontiers of the Empire against-fierce and barbarous tribes could never be a mere citizen of the world; and it' is not insignificant that we find Marcus Aurelius, who was himself thus engaged during part of the time that he set down his notes, more than once giving a marked place in his reflections to his duties as the first of Roman citizens. "Being Antoninus, I have Rome to my city and country; being a man, the world. The weal, then, of these cities is the sole measure of good for me."' Before passing on we may note that the connexion between the social morality of Stoicism and its cosmical theory is well given in a single sentence, by Cicero:" They (the Stoics) are of opinion that the world is governed by the power of the gods, and is in a manner a common city' and polity of men and gods; of which world each one of us is a member. Whence this follows in course of nature, that we set the common weal before our own." 2 The next question may seem to be of this kind: All this being so, how did the Stoic morality provide for dealing with the problems of conduct that arise in actual life ? The founda- tions of the work being thus laid, by what rule were the details assigned ? And if it is indeed a material part of the businiess of moral philosophy to tell people what is right and wrong, in given circumstances, there is no doubt that Stoicism must be found sadly wanting. There is very little in Marcus Aurelius that could be used to throw any direct light on particular cases of conscience. But there is another view of the office of moral philosophy not wholly without supporters, which is that this task is exactly what moral philosophy should not attempt. According to this opinion the office of ethical science, so far as it has a practical bearing on conduct, is not to solve special problems, but to form a habit of mind fit to solve thein in action. The object is to impart not bare precepts, but moral habits which may bear the good fruit of right intention guided by trained judgment; not to teach men what actions are right, but to make them rightminded. A healthy moral constitution may be trusted to deal with the particular cases as they arise. You cannot make yourself righteous by working out a set of fixed rules; on the contrary, when you want to know how to apply 1 VI. 44. 2 cie., De Fin., III. 64.</page><page sequence="18">64 Marcus Aurelius and the Stowc Philosophy. the rule in a new instance you must take the judgment of the righteous man. This conception, more familiar perhaps to the Greeks than to most of ourselves, is often present in Aristotle, and there are indications, at least, in Marcus Aurelius that it was practically adopted by the Stoics. We find the healthy moral sense expressly compared to the healthy sicht or taste of bodily sense.' It is well known that the ideal wise msan of the school was conceived as infallible in his moral judgment; this however proves nothing as to the supposed character of the pro- cess of juclgment itself. But I do not think the process is anywhere represented as one of calculation fromn rules, save so far as an accurate knowledge of the circumstances and conse- quences is dwelt upon as necessarv to right action; and this last has to do with the conditions of the problem rather than with the actual solution. It is true that soine of the Stoics appear to have committed thernselves to what is now called casuistry, and not to have escaped the kind of odium which has become attached to the like inquiries in later times. And certainly some of their results, as handed down to us (if we could be sure that they are fairly represented), are not altogether edifying. But the displeasure they gave was due in great measure to their adopting from the Cynics an open and offensive disregard of men's common feel- ings. There was an original connexion between the Stoic and the Cynic schools, and though the Cynic elemnents of the Stoic doctrines were gradually thrust into the backoround, or ex- plained away by the mnore enlightened leaders, yet there was always a Cynic wing, as we might now say, of 'the Stoics, and Cynical propositions held their ground as commonplaces.long after they had ceased to be consistent -with the developed and active social morality of the school. We find several tinmes in M. Aurelius a vein of coarse and exaggerated depreciation of all ordinary objects of desire, where the argument, such as it is, consists in exhibiting them as resolved into elements which are separately worthless or disgusting.2 These passages can be accounted 'for, I think, only as a residue of Cynic traditions. They have no real affinity with the 'lofty cosmical disdain witVm which, as has already been seen, the Stoics endeavoured to look down upon the slight and mutable thiings of this world, but which is consistent with an earnest purpose of doing the best one can, however littre it may be, and not despising one's work for not being greater,3 and which sought contentment not in IX 35r 2 VI. 13; VIII. 24, 37; IX. 36; XI. 2.

It is no Cynical prompting that bids men pray, not for the objects of desire, but for a soul fiee from desire.' Developed Stoicism is equally remote from the crudity of the Cynics on the one hand, and from asceticism on the other. Man's physical well-being (5 z&amp; ?Lov bV6o-t) is not to be suppressed, but rather cultivated, in subjection however to the demands of his reasonable and social well-beinlg ( ZS ?aov XO7lKOV Vfl7t9, 7O XO7yKOV Kas 7TOXlTlKOV).2 The Stoic optimism and its curious consequences are perhaps the most generally known parts of the system. The Stoics, lholding that the universe was governed by i-mmutable law, which law was the expression of perfect reason and the pattern of all good, were necessarily optimists. They looked upon the universe as good in a human and ethical sense, and the Wise Man was the purposed crown and glory of creatures. And they had accordingly to face the question which every scheme of benevolent teleology has to face in some way-namely, Why do good men suffer evil in the world? The answer they gave de- serves admiration for its boldness. They siniply denied the fact. They said that the supposed evils are not evils at all; the common objects of desire or aversion, in so far as they do not involve ethical merit or demerit in the person enjoying or suffer- ing, are neither good nor bad, but indifferent. This is the cele- brated doctrine of Adiaphoria, which the Stoics maintained against all comers with great zeal and pertinacity; yet they had to admit that for practical purposes there must be such a thing as a rational preference among these indiferent things, if only because the Wise Man must needs -make some choice among them; and they saved a contradiction in terms by ingenious distinctions and refinements, on the particulars of which we need not enter here. The line of thought by which the main doctrine was reached is no matter of conjecture: it is distinctly given, for instance, by M. Aurelius, when he says that nothing can be really good or bad which befalls good and bad men alike.3 The topic was considered by the Stoics as one of im- portance on account of its practical value in strengthening, the mind against the common temptations of the world, and the deliberate cultivation of Adiaphoria, the attitude of pure indif- rerence towards the whole contents of the neutral field "between virtue and vice," was recommended as a point of moral disci- pline&amp;.4 The same optimism led in much the same way to the I IX. 40. 2 X. 2. The Cynics, it has been well remarked, were not ascetics; for they sought not to mortify desires, but to recluce them to the least number, and satisfy them in the cheapest and coarsest way. 3 TV. 39. 4 VII. 31. 5</page><page sequence="20">66 Marcus Aurelius and tae Stoic PAilosopphy. well-known Stoic paradoxes concerning, the blessed state of the Wise Man. Since no real harm can befall the man who pos- sesses true wisdom and virtue (it will be remembered that with the Stoics these were synonymous), and he who does not possess them possesses no real good, it follows that the wise man alone is entitled to all the honourable additions which men are accus- tomed to bestow indiscriminately; to him alone belong freedom, wealth, and kingship-even personal beauty was not omitted from the catalogue.' These and kindred propositions were not taken by the Stoics in the way of rhetoric or metaphor; we are told, indeed, that the school was averse to rhetorical expansion. They were seriously maintained as literal truth, and defended with the utmost rigour of dialectic.2 Still, it is difficult to believe that Stoic teachers always resisted their capacities for rhetorical treatment. Cicero has left us some specimens in this kind, and in particular a little book entitled Paradoxes, where he sets forth the Stoic maxims in a popular manner. It 'may be convenient to give the heads-they are as follows: 1. Moral good [TO KcaXoP, honestum] is the only good. 2. Virtue suffices for happiness. 3. There are no degrees of wrongness or rightness in actions. 4. Every fool [--not-wise in the Stoic sense] is mad. 5.-The wise man alone is free, and every fool is a slave. 6. The wise man alone is rich. Outsiders naturally found here a tempting field for ridicule, and were not slow to make the most of it. Serious argument was not so easy as it might seem at first sight, for the Stoic could meet any appeal to facts by explaining that there was not a real Wise Man to be found in the world. It was certain that there had been very few altogether, and it was an opeln ques- tioni whether any one had come quite up to the mark in histori- cal times. Socrates and one or two others were commonly ad- mitted, and some of the Roman Stoics ventured to add Cato.3 1 See, for example, Cic., De Fin., III. 75; Hor., Ep., I. i. 106; Sat., II. iii, 45 (the whole Satire is an illulstrationof the paradox, 7ra-9 (/pwv Fa1t'YTa, No. 4 in Cicero's list). 2 Cato autem, perfectus mea sententia Stoicus . . . in ea est haeresi quae nullum sequitur florem orationis neque dilatat argumentum; minautis interrogatiunculis, quasi punctis quod proposuit efficit.- Cic., Parad., Procem. 3The singular parallel between wisdom in the Stoic philosophy and the state of grace in Augustinian theology is pointed out by Zeller (op. cit. 235). It extends even to the detail of the transition or conversion from -tter darkness to perfect enlightenment being the work of a moment. It will be noted that the number of the elect is muchb more narrowly limited by Stoicism than by even the most rigid forms of Calvinism; there may not be a single wise man in many centuries. But then the consequences of ex-</page><page sequence="21">Marcus Aurelius and the Stoic Ph6ilosophy. 67 But here, again, they made a compromise with practical needs. Strictly speaking, one must either be in the perfect light of wisdom, or in an outer darkness wherein there were no degrees. Amiss is a miss, they said, whether the shaft goes a hair's-breadth or a mile beside the mark. Yet they de-vised the notion of a certain proficiency towards real excellence, which might approxi- mate indefinitely to it in its effects, though it could never be the same thing; a kind of ethical asymptote to the unattainable ideal. All this was likely enough to degenerate into quibbling and mere verbal puzzles, especially under the influence of a fondness for the curiosities of dialectic (Cicero speaks of the Stoics as cultivating conclutsiunculae, and see the quotation in the note above) which was characteristic of the school. The paradoxical and polemical aspects of the system acquired undue prominence in the eyes of critics and ouLtside observers, and, I think, have retained it in modern times. It is remarkable that there is hardly a trace of them in Marcuis Aurelius. So far as one can guess from his writing, Horace's jesting notice of Chry- sippus's dictum that the Wise iMan would be the best of cobblers, if he chose, must have fallen quite harmless upon him. May we not suppose that the men who, like Marcus Aurelius, took up Stoicism not as a -literary profession but as a guide to the conduct of active life were content to leave this kind of dis- cussion alone, or even in their hearts despised it as mere verbal 'trifling ? It will readily be understood, but perhaps I should expressly repeat it, that the object of the foregoing pages is not to give an exposition of the Stoic system, such as it was, or may have been, officially set forth by the founders and masters of the school, but to trace the substance and connexion of the doc- trines which appear to me to have contained its working power for Marcus Aurelius and those of whom he is the type. The history of Greek philosophy is a magnificent and weighty sub- ject, which yet remains to be worthily treated by an English- man. My present endeavour is not only within narrow. bounds in extent, but altogether in a narrower sphere. But no inquiry can be worthless which may throw any light upon the character and moral training of the men whose arts and arms, maintained by Roman energy, and touched with the fire of Greek intellect, elusion were comparatively slight. There is a coincidence of a higher kind with Christian thought when Marcus Aurelius bids himself lead a new life froni every moment, "as one that is dead, and whose past life is now finished," (VII. 56) * "thou shalt be a new man and enter upon a new life " (X. 8). A not less striking parallel may be found in the Btuddhist Nirvana, if that (as maintained by Mr. Rhys Davids) is a state of passionless perfection, theoretically attainable even in the present life.</page><page sequence="22">68 Pessimism. established the empire and the peace of Rome, and created the civilised world. NOTE.--I may add a word here about editions and translations of Marcus Aurelius. No author wants a commentary more, but Marcus Aurelius has been strangely neglected in this respect. There is, I believe, no annotated edition later than Gataker's, which dates from the middle of the seven- teenth century. The text is often difficult, or corrupt, or both; the condition of some places is probably hopeless. Besides other scholars, Corais and Schultz have done good work upon it, but much yet remains to do. The Tauchnitz reprint of Schultz's text (which is practically'the only" available edition for ordinary purposes) has critical notes, but the absence of all dlscriminating marks in the text itself is a drawback. For Eniglish readers the want of a commentarv is, to a considerable extent, supplied by Mr. LQng's excellent translation; not altogether, for I think, with all deference to the taste of a master in criticism, that the Greek has, if not exactly a charm, yet enough of a " distinct physiognomy " to keep one from leaving it on the shelf. One can only regret that Mr. Long's notes are so few and brief. A new French translation has been published by M. Barth6lemy St. Hilaire (Paris, 1876). The version is more finished in style than Mr. Long's, but often at the cost of exactness. Corruipt passages are slurred over, for instance, in a way quite inadmissible accord- ing to English notions of scholarship, by guesses at the general sense which do not stand for any particular reading. There is a runninig cominentary, which does not attempt any specific tracing of the various Stoic doctrines, and does attempt, with very indifferent success, to find in M. Aurelius the tone and arguments of a modern French philosopher of the spiritualiste school. The notes, in fact, are rather homiletic than exegetic. The object appears to be simply to reproduce the book in a form suited for modern use -as an aid to moral reflection. FREDERICK POLLOCK.</page></plain_text>
