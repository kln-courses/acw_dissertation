<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nkisi Figures of the Lower Congo ZDENKA VOLAAVKO VA hen missionaries and travellers of the past encountered fetishes in the numerous villages and towns of the lower Congo, their judgements of these specific African works of art were unanimous. These "devil images" (Dapper, 1676; Merolla, 1683) "rudely carved in wood and covered with dirty rags" (J. K. Tuckey, 1816) were "ferocious in appearance" (H. M. Stanley, 1895). Lieutenant J. K. Tuckey compared them with "scare- crows" and the Catholic and Baptist missionaries at the end of the 19th century considered them "indecent" (J. H. Weeks, W. H. Bentley) or "frankly obscene" (A. J. Wauters). In modern times, after exposure to Dada and Surrealist objects, the Western response to the African fetish is no longer so negative. Their artistic form, however, still poses many prob- lems and discussions.1 Let me mention at least the evaluations of fetishes by two major representatives of the study of African art. Frans Olbrechts, in his book on the art of the Congo, stated that he saw a strong distinction be- tween Kongo ancestor figures and fetish figures, the latter never reveal- ing a "neat and technically perfect aspect".2 William Fagg, on the other hand, speaking on the African fetish in general in the introduction to the Webster Plass Collection, concluded that the carver, in most cases, had consciously tried to make the fetishes beautiful and aesthetically satisfying.3 Fetish figures are generally divided according to the character of their effect into two principal groups: the malevolent and the benevolent. The classification of the Kongo Minkisi is often more detailed in view of their great variety. Father Van Wing,4 for instance, found among the Mpangu more than one hundred and fifty kinds of Minkisi (fetishes), the statuettes of which he divided into Biteke and Nkondi. According to him, Biteke probably denote large figures and Nkondi smaller ones, or a special kind of fetish with a specific function. Then he defined several groups of fetishes according to their functions: healing fetishes, fetishes of the bush or of waters, and detective fetishes. A Baptist missionary, J. H. Weeks,5 however, who spent almost thirty years with the Kongo, first in the area of Sao Salvador and then with the eastern Kongo, dealt with the groups of fetishes only in terms of their denominations, disregarding the types. Beginning with Dapper in 1676 and the record of the Capuchin missionary Merolla, 1683, and ending with mis- sionary writings of the late 19th and early 20th century, there were pre- sented as many descriptions and classi- fications of fetishes of the Lower Congo as there were authors. None of the classifications were free from ambiguities and vagueness; there was overlapping from one group to another of types of fetishes and their functions. In the late twenties and early thirties J. Maes pursued, in his five studies, the systematic classification of fetishes of the Lower Congo. He divided the fetish figures into four groups: the healing fetishes, called Na Moganga;6 the malevolent Npezo figures, causing someone's sickness;7 Mbula figures, which protect chiefs against the witch power of the ndoki;8 and finally the most malevolent Konde, the nail fetishes, which inflict serious illness upon persons who are believed to be the cause of trouble.9 Maes' classifica- tion is based upon the functions of the objects. He attempted to prove, how- ever, that each group corresponds to one or more figural types, with charac- teristic artistic features. Na Moganga are, according to the above classification, sitting figures with the arm supporting the head (Solongo, Kongo, Yumbe) or standing figures with truncated arms (Sundi, Bwenda). They are richly decorated with various substances and high hair-styles and are always very carefully sculpted, with peaceful and mild expressions. Maes states that the sculptor wanted to incorporate in his statue the benevol- ent attributes endowing it with the general aspect of a restful, reasoning, and powerful man who disseminates joy and good fortune.'? On the other hand, the Konde and Npezo figures possess, besides their specific types of figure, a threatening appearance which, in the case of Npezo fetishes, is weakened by the laughing and ironic expression of the face. Finally, according to this view, the sculptors who tried to give to the Konde figures especially, a terrible and furious appearance," did not aim for awfulness of aspect when carving an Mbula fetish. The main attribute of the latter is a bunch of small tubes which are filled with various sub- stances, the most common of which is gunpowder for killing the ndoki.'2 This classification of the Minkisi into Na Moganga, Npezo, Mbula, and Konde groups poses several art histori- cal problems. When cataloguing any collection of sculpture of the Lower Congo one discovers very early that attributes and artistic features do not give unequivocal evidence for assign- ing a figure to any one of the groups. For instance, a piece from the Museum of Primitive Art, New York (Fig. 2) does not show any "attacking" gesture and the expression of the face is peace- ful and almost dreamy, the figure having closed eyes. All these elements would qualify the figure as a healing fetish, Na Moganga. One finds, how- ever, in the assemblage of appended attributes, a small dagger and driven nails, which are linked with the Konde group, as well as two bunches of hang- ing tubes which belong to the equip- ment of the Mbula fetishes. Probably because of these attributes, the figure is described in the Museum catalogue as a malevolent fetish rather than a benevolent one as might be expected from its artistic features. An Nkisi figure in the Neues Museum at St. Gallen, Switzerland (Fig. 3),13 like a similar piece in the Museum of Primitive Art, New York (Fig. 4), exhibits many of the signifi- cant features of the Npezo fetishes. The bodies of both sculptures are leaning forward, which pose was 1. STANDING FIGURE WITH NAILS (DETAIL). WOOD, PAINT, MIXED MEDIA. KONGO. WHOLE FIGURE 251/2".

Finally, the headdress in both cases corresponded to the Npezo types as defined by J. Maes.'4 The feather crown of the St. Gallen figure is not preserved, yet the traces in the resin helmet prove its former existence. However, the St. Gallen sculpture, which was purchased before 1915 at Ganda-Sundi, came to the Museum described as a fetish against foot ail- ments; that is as a healing Nkisi. The last example, also a figure from the Neues Museum (Fig. 7), has all the attributes and features of an Mbula fetish which should kill the ndoki to 2. STANDING FIGURE. WOOD, MIXED MEDIA.

However, the original description, given to the Mu- seum in 1915 by the person who pur- chased the statue at Handa-Sundi, indicates that it is a Zasi Solo fetish used against pulmonary illnesses. The same problem occurs when examining written records, many of which are, in this regard, neither pre- cise nor rich enough. There are, how- ever, several important pieces of information which enable one to view in history the relationships of the function to type and artistic form. The English trader, Andrew Battell of Leigh, who stayed in Loango prob- ably from 1607 to 1610 and who made a trip to Mayombe, described a large image called a Maramba fetish which he had seen in Mani Mayombe.'5 The figure detected murderers, thieves, and witches by killing them and was used also in initiation rituals. The chief took it with him every time he travelled and also made offerings to it. Thus, the figure was supposed to per- form at least three different kinds of activity: besides the political function associated with the chief, it was to protect the initiated, and kill male- factors and suspected people. John H. Weeks, who stayed with the Kongo for thirty years beginning in 1882, gave very detailed data about the function of Minkisi. He described the activity of the "lion doctor" (nganga nkosi) who was invited at times by men who had been robbed, to curse the unknown thief with pulmonary illness. If any person then got a lung disease and all remedies failed, the person was believed to be a thief and the "lion doctor" was called. He used his fetish first for the action called loca e nkisi and then for the one called lembola e nkisi.'6 Loka means in Kikongo "to kill or harm somebody" or "the destructive force" while lem- bula means "to take off, to wipe out, or to heal".17 One single Nkisi was thus employed (as in the case of Battell's Maramba) for two contradictory actions: accusing and healing. The image called Ebunze Nkisi both gave and cured apoplexy and was used by thieves as a protection in a rob- bery.18 The image utilized by the Nganga Mbambi inflicted and cured deep-seated ulcers.19 The very power- ful Nzaji Nkisi could both protect and kill by lightning and give and heal a skin disease; it was finally employed to subdue slaves and bind them to their masters.20 These few examples from the records agree with the data obtained in the preceding considerations on Nkisi sculptures. In addition, they give evidence that polyvalency is inherent to the Minkisi and did not develop or degenerate in the course of time. Some changes probably occurred in history, but only in relation to applica- tion of the fetishes. Dapper in the 18th century noted the female form of the Nkisi called Nkosi, the lion, which he mentioned when dealing with Loan- go.21. In the 1930's Van Wing gave a detailed description of both forms of Nkosi, the female one being a sack and the male one an anthropomorphic figure.22 In Dapper's presentation the Nkosi are utilized as protection against lightning and sickness. The Mpangu in the area of Van Wing's mission at Kesantu, on the other hand, used Nkosi to detect and kill thieves and ndoki, and in the Kimpasi initiation society against disobedient members. It is believed that the Nkosi, having detect- ed the enemy, kills him by crushing him so that all blood gradually leaves his body. The same cruel vision is reflected also in the incantation song of the male Nkosi noted by Van Wing.23 Words like Kimenga kyaku dia (drink his blood), Zeka nsingu (twist his neck), or Uonda (kill!) directly contrast with the peaceful male figure which was published by Van Wing24 and which reveals neither in its me- dium nor in its composition and sculptural treatment any trace of a menacing expression. The most terrible appearance is attributed to the nail figures. In anthropological literature they are generally known as Konde or Nkonde. Laman's Dictionary of 1936 notes Khonde which designates in the Yombe dialect an Nkisi, and Nkondi which means a hunter who leaves to hunt in secret, and an Nkisi provoking a sick- ness in the chest, an Nkisi detecting a thief, or finally, a large statue in wood.25 The last meaning corresponds to Van Wing's interpretation of Nkondi as being among the Mpangu, either a large or small Nkisi figure.26 On the other hand, J. H. Weeks, who lived in Sao Salvador and with the Zombo and other Eastern Bakongo, mentioned the nail figures called Mbanzangola which belonged only to the magician and never to a private person.27 According to most records, the nail sculpture operates in a destructive way. Some- times, however, it is mentioned as a healing fetish.28 A. Maesen designates its role as ambivalent.29 The meaning of knife-stabs or of nails driven into the vital parts also seems to be some- what ambiguous; there is an interpre- tation viewing them as offerings for benefits received. A nail may also be driven into the image by a sick person to pass on his complaint to an enemy, who, he thinks, sent it to him.30 The destructive and horrible impres- sion of Nkondi figures results from their specific paraphernalia such as nails and other attributes, and from 54</page><page sequence="4">their partial polychromy, rather than from the carved statuettes themselves. Even the "menacing" gesture is often replaced by the gesture of the medicin- al figures. Such is the case, for instance, of the large, almost life-size sculpture from the Linden-Museum, Stuttgart (Fig. 6), and of other nail figures pub- lished by Jurgen Zwernemann.3' Sometimes, the gesture of the figure becomes irrevelant, being hidden by the paraphernalia. Nails and knife stabs have a great deal to do with the total expression of Nkondi figures. However, they doubt- less became components of the statu- ettes only when the carver's influence was ended. The art historians of the period of Romanticism would probably have demanded their removal, con- sidering them to be reminders of ritual and not the intention of the artist. Today's aesthetic appreciation includes them in the artistic com- ponents of the figure. As such, they appear strange within the context of the traditional media of African art. Unlike the decorative round-headed nails which occur in Songye sculpture and sometimes appear in the Lower Congo, the nails and knife marks on the Nkondi figures are naturalistic. Used on the anthropomorphic shape of the figures, they operate as wound- ing instruments. This effect probably accounts for the theory that they are influenced by the Christian idea of the nail symbolizing Christ's suffering. Without claiming the latter hypothe- sis to be a final solution, it can be sup- ported with some arguments. The earliest record on nail figures of the Lower Congo that I have been able to find, that of Tuckey, is dated 1816.32 Dapper, who in the 17th century com- piled in his descriptions of Loango, Kongo and Angola much detailed data on African objects and rituals, men- tioned the use of iron nails and fish- hooks only in connection with a pot filled with earth and hung with rags.33 The 16th and 17th centuries, the period before and after the Jaga inva- sion, is the period of a cultural syn- cretism expanding mainly from Sao Salvador, Soyo, and the port of Cabinda. Through trade and missions many non-African objects came into the country. "All the missionaries carried a chest along with them containing all things necessary for the holy sacrifice," stated the Capuchin Denis de Carli.34 Pigafetta spoke of "many divers images of Christ, of the Virgin Mother and of other Saints" brought to the Kongo by the Portu- guese.35 The assimilation of these objects by the Kongo was doubtless not as easy and peaceful as Pigafetta thought. The king, he said, gathered his people together "and instead of their idols which before they had in reverence, he gave them crucifixes and images of saints..." and "they never more remembered their former belief in false and lying idols."36 Dapper, in 1676, viewed the situation more realistically stating that the people in the Kongo, had "two arrows in their bows," Catholic and Pagan ones, mixing the objects of both rituals.37 This situation still existed in some areas in the 19th century. Cap- tain Tuckey, in 1816, saw at Noki, in the region of the cataracts, that "the crucifixes left by the missionaries were strangely mixed with the native fetishes and the people seemed by no means improved by this melange of Christian and Pagan idolatry." 8 "Santu" crosses and crucifixes, utilized as amulets bringing good fortune in hunting,39 as tokens of prestige in the investiture and in the procedures of justice40 and probably for other purposes as well, prove that the period of syncretism in art was no short episode. Tata Nsiesie observed, in the early 20th century, a special predilec- tion for small copper images of the Immaculate, and for the wooden statu- ette of St. Anthony.41 The latter was worn by pregnant Kongo women on the breast in order to have either a son or a daughter, according to the kind of offering given it. In the early 1880's J. H. Weeks received such a sculpture from a young man in whose family it had been for several generations where it was regarded as a fetish.42 The syncretism consisted both of the common ritual use of imported and traditional works of art and of the initial production of objects varying from the imported type and form. In addition, the vision of the people was necessarily affected by the strange formal and symbolic vocabulary, of which particular elements were very 4. STANDING FIGURE WITH RECEPTACLE.

MUSEE ROYAL, DE L'AFRIQUE CENTRALE, TERVUREN probably incorporated in their art. To return to the wounding nails and stabs driven into the bodies of the sculpture, it is pertinent to mention a short story recorded by Merolla. At the mission at Soyo "on the feast of the Purification of the Virgin Mary, I had a mind to preach a sermon against these prac- tices [fetishism, initiation, etc.] and the better to move the people, I had before placed the image, in relief, of this blessed saint, covered on the altar, with a dagger stuck through her breast from which the blood flowed; this done, I began to discourse against those women that observed the hellish delusions before mentioned, proving that they thereby not only offended their loving Saviour, but likewise did great injury to his immaculate mother. At the same instant I drew aside the curtain and discovered the image, which the people perceiving so wounded and bloody, began immedi- ately to relent, and broke out into the extremest grief."43 This story may serve as an example of new experiences to which the people were exposed in the time when the missions were at their peak. Thus, in the complex syncretic process the symbols of Christ's suffering and the Virgin's sorrow might have been amal- gamated by the African system of signs and become instruments inflict- ing an enemy with serious disease or death. Finally, a record noted by Dapper may contribute to the approxi- mate dating of this change. An Nkisi called Kikokoo, which appears also in other records, was a man's image of black wood standing in the village of Kinga on the coast of Loango. It kept the sea calm and brought much trade and many fish to Loango. Stolen one night by two young men from a Portuguese boat, it was damaged. Therefore the young men drove nails into its head and arm in order to attach them again to the body, and, in the night, returned the statuette to the village. A story was immediately dif- fused by the nganga saying that Kiko- koo had been to Portugal and brought back with him a boat full of merchan- dise. Shortly after this, a Portuguese boat was wrecked on the Loango coast. The people explained it as the statuette's revenge for the nails driven in its head while in Portugal.44 Dap- per's story records what is doubtless an oral African legend. In an indirect way it reveals that the driving in of nails and stab marks was not at that time a current ritual, and that the practice may have started as a novelty sometime about or after the mid-17th century. Nails and knives driven into the sculpture are crucial for its aesthetic appearance. They are directly linked with the total function pf the fetish, although the latter is not precisely definable. They represent, however, a specific element which was added to the statuettes after the artist's work was finished and was not therefore an intentional artistic medium. In addi- tion, this element is not, most probab- ly, an autochthonous one, but is an assimilated attribute. Previous obser- vations of some fetishes, on the one hand, and of several written records, on the other, resulted in the following conclusions: 1. the function of Minkisi was and is ambiguous; 2. an Nkisi figure operates in most cases in an antithetical way-both as a benefactor and malefactor; 3. the morphological features and the types of the fetishes are not in accordance with their functions. When viewed as works of art, many Nkisi figures show a contrast in the making of the head or face and that of the body.45 The rendering of the head is fine and the forms are sensitively moulded. The body, arms and legs, on the other hand, are sometimes hardly articulated and are roughly carved in large cuts. The head and body are not balanced in the rendering or the pro- portions. Sometimes the discrepancy between the carefully carved head and the coarsely carved body cannot be seen, the body being hidden partly or completely by the paraphernalia. There are also, however, many cases in which the carving and shaping of the body is as delicate as that of the head, although it is still covered by the paraphernalia. The fundamental medium of the Nkisi figures is wood. The figure used as a fetish, however, is an assemblage of heterogeneous materials and objects all of which, with the carved wooden 56</page><page sequence="6">part, make one single complex appre- ciated as a work of art. In the light of existing records it is possible to trace each step of the process by which this complex originates. When a person feels the need to own a fetish, he buys a statuette either from a carver or in the market.46 This statuette is not yet an Nkisi, but only the basis for one; the person has bought a piece of sculpture, not an Nkisi. This image or sculpture is called in the Eastern Kongo teke or teki.47 An Nkisi figure comes into exist- ence only after a ceremony in which the force or "respect" (nkinda) is put into the image and the paraphernalia added to it. This second part of the work on the sculpture is performed by the nganga, the diviner. He places the magic substance not only in a recep- tacle in the body, but often in the head also. He shapes the headdress, some- times paints the figure's face, and adds various materials and small objects to the statuette, sometimes covering most of its parts. Thus, the statuette leaves the carver's hands in an unfinished stage. The nganga's intervention is a ritual one, yet it influences fundamentally the morphology of the figure and its artistic effect. The carver finishes the face, for instance, giving to it a specific volume and endowing its features with specific shapes and spatial depth. If he does not actually carve the headdress itself in wood, he will prepare a kind of peg or substructure with engraved surface so that the moulded headdress will hold well. The headdress then added by the nganga becomes an artistic part of the figure, interacting with the carved face through its volumes, shapes and textures. This special division of labor be- tween the carver and the nganga may be eliminated only in the case of personal union. This occurred, for instance, with Mipako, both wood- carver and nganga among the Sise in the Teke area, who was the informant of Robert Hottot.48 Evaluation by society of the carver's work, on the one hand, and the nganga's work on a single feature, on the other, is remarkably different. J. H. Weeks49 noted that a wooden image could be bought for a yard or two of common calico. Its change into a strong fetish, however, could cost the buyer forty or fifty yards or even the price of a slave. The nganga's participation is appar- ently much more highly valued than is the wood carver's work. Older records sometimes mention the nganga as being the author of the whole image,50 which might suggest that this differ- ence in the appreciation is a traditional phenomenon. The question now is whether the price difference shows merely the high appreciation of the magical ritual or whether it expresses also something about the artistic value. The analogy exists in late medieval European wood carving. The carver was paid much less than the painter who painted the sculpture.5' Both were considered artists in the medi- eval sense, but the work of the first one did not result in a final product. In the case of the Nkisi figure, only the carver is the artist. The discrepancy in the price, however, may also be due to the fact that his work is materially unfinished. The materials and objects added by the nganga to the figures are not only heterogeneous, but are curious, un- usual and enigmatic. The unexpected compositions often fascinated Euro- pean travellers of the past. "There is nothing so vile in nature, that does not serve for a negro's fetish" noted the naturalists of Tuckey's expedition in their diary.52 These combinations of, for instance, the European iron pad- lock, a bird's bill, the head of a snake, with nuts, pebbles, a hunting net and bead necklaces53 were, there is no doubt, intended to strongly affect the purchasers. The absurdity of such compositions of objects and substances taken from their natural contexts and put into new, artificial ones served as 7. STANDING FIGURE WITH TUBES AND RECEPTACLE. WOOD, MIXED MEDIA. COLLECTED AT UPPER MAYUMBE AREA. 121/4". NEUES MUSEUM, SAMMLUNGEN FUR VOLKERKUNDE, ST. GALLEN 57</page><page sequence="7">an important means of expression. The unforeseen and surprising also played their parts. Numerous are the records stating that the people preferred to have an nganga who came from a village distant from their own. For medicinal purposes they seldom, if ever, engaged the nganga from their own village. As Weeks said, "they know too much about him to waste their money on him. They see him repairing his charms and fetishes from the depredations of rats, cockroaches and white ants...."54 What the nganga adds to the figure is considered functional, but to a large extent, it operates psychologically. The nganga assigns the fetish a specific function sometimes by means of the paraphernalia, but generally by means of the name given to the figure in the course of its ritual initiation. The carver also tried at times to comply with the future paraphernalia of the statuette. For instance, the piece from the Tervuren Museum found in the neighborhood of Boma (Fig. 5) reveals the artist's intention to prepare an Nkisi figure having a container for magical ingredients in its stomach and one on the right shoulder, similar to a Kongo statuette at the Musee de l'Homme (Fig. 9). The Tervuren figure, which was not finished by the nganga, shows well how the wood carver had prepared the surface of the statuette for the resin overmodellation and for the headdress. There are, how- ever, numerous instances proving that the artist's intention was not pursued or was misunderstood by the nganga. Sometimes the nganga disregarded the fact that the body should be partly covered, and at other times he neglect- ed the peg for the headdress. He left the statuette both materially unfin- ished and artistically disharmonious. Finally, other instances show that the nganga sometimes changed even the carved parts, covering, for example, 8. STANDING FIGURE WITH RECEPTACLE ON THE CROWN (DETAIL). WOOD, MIXED MEDIA. KONGO. HEIGHT OF WHOLE FIGURE 32". MUSEE DE L'HOMME, PARIS the carved hairstyle by the resin hat which he probably considered impor- tant for a particular function. Such is the case, for instance, of the figure from the Tervuren Museum collected at Boma. Each nganga might have had some personal convention in the use of his attributes, yet improvisation also played a part. The attributes of an Nkisi figure were also sometimes sub- sequently changed. Most Minkisi, in other words, have been employed many times. Sometimes the nganga simply followed a different mode of procedure to use the same fetish for a purpose other than its previous one. At other times, however, he even adapted the fetish for another opera- tion of the same cult. J. H. Weeks mentioned that there may have been simultaneously in use 1000 charms and fetishes of a particular name, a situation offering freedom for much improvisation, considering that there were no fixed iconographical rules. Finally, an Nkisi figure which is found weak or ineffective may be returned to the nganga. The records suggest that the nganga, after a little adaptation, sometimes sold them to another client. The previous considerations might make clear the complex procedure in which the Nkisi figure gradually originates as both a work of art and a functioning fetish. Some partial results may be concluded: 1. Many of the unfinished figures in the collections and museums are not Minkisi but Biteki (non-potential statuettes). They were probably bought either from the artists or in the market. 2. The non finito of these Nkisi figures may appear in both the material and artistic senses. 3. The reason for their non finito is to be found in the specific division of the working process between the carver and the nganga, rather than in the different evaluation by the society of the fetishes on the one hand and of the basic sculpture on the other. The correlation of the work of the wood carver to that of the nganga is crucial for the final artistic quality of an Nkisi figure. Several of the instances already discussed showed how the carver technically prepared for the nganga's intervention. Finally, it seems possible to demonstrate how the carver's anticipation of this co- operation appears in some of the artis- tic features of the statuette. One of the arguments offered regarding the care- lessness in the making of the Nkisi figures is the exclusion of the forearms. This feature contrasts, in the eyes of the Western viewer, with the anthro- pomorphic character of the figure and may awaken the impression of muti- lated body. This motif, unusual in African sculpture on the whole, 58</page><page sequence="8">probably manifests the carver's respect for the completion of the figure by the nganga by giving the latter greater freedom for attaching a receptacle. The statuette with its arms behind its back was interpreted as being like a slave with tied hands. Drawing an analogy with some other figures having only one forearm behind the back, while the second arm was occupied with another and probably symbolic gesture, I prefer to consider the placing of the arms behind the back as a com- positional matter and not as a realistic gesture illustrating the depicted person's status. Very rare are the Nkisi figures lack- ing gesture, with arms falling straight down along the body. This rarity encourages me to assume that in general the arms are a substantial part of the fetish, being the carriers of the gesture. The gesture cannot be read, in my opinion, as a narrative element in Western terms, but as a vehicle for the potential of the fetish. The raised arm, for example, seems to be more a sign of prestige in the hierarchy of fetish potencies than a killing or menacing gesture. Returning to the relationship between the arms and the receptacle, some gestures appear to aim at the resin box. These gestures are probably somehow symbolically linked with the substances which the nganga is supposed to introduce. Later the receptacle added by the nganga may cover the hands and the forearm. Thus, the carver composed the figure giving to the nganga a kind of visual suggestion to attach a smaller or larger box. The artistic result depends, in this specific division of the working pro- cess, very much upon the nganga's visual sensibility and experience and upon mutual understanding. Numer- ous instances show the resin box corre- sponding or interacting in its pattern and volume with the proportions and the angular or round forms of the figure. The carver often goes rather far in his visual suggestions. The poses of the figures and the distribution of their mass also suggest to the nganga the approximate shapes of the recept- acle or headdress. The result depends very much upon the nganga's ability to read the carver's visual language. His added attributes and paraphernalia may complete and emphasize the balance of the volumes and forms of the statuette, and may operate more or less in the interplay of its protruded shapes. Or, in the opposite case, the added elements may more or less suppress the reading of the visual message. This message plays, with the Nkisi figures, its specific aesthetic role, being neither implication nor illustra- tion of any precise function. Finally, some rather general con- clusions may be given: 1. The precise function of the Nkisi figures of the Lower Congo does not, and did not, in history, implicate their particular forms and types, the assign- ments of the fetish being mostly oral and magical. 2. The artist carved the statuette ignor- ant of its function in terms of the fetish ritual, and therefore, he was not able to illustrate the function realistically. 3. The final form and type of the Nkisi figure does not result (in opposition to the Western art of the 19th and 20th centuries) solely from the artist's vision and intention, but from the cooperation of both the carver and the nganga and eventually the consumers as well, and is affected by the nganga's comprehension of the carver's visual impulses. The artist's suggestions more or less regulate the artistic completion of the figure, but do not intervene in its function. 4. Particular features of the morphol- ogy and of the types such as pose, gesture, and composition are not psy- chological and realistic interpretations of the functional assignments of the figures, but have traditional symbolic meanings. 5. Lower Congo has been exposed, since the 15th century, to strong European cultural impact. The art of this area is often used to serve as an example of the thesis that Western influence expressed itself in the real- ism of this art, in the choice of its motifs and character of its style. The Nkisi figures do show the integration of some foreign elements and objects. On the other hand, the evidence discussed in this study indicates that the figures did not undergo any fundamental change in conception. It is the interpretation of them, rather than their own charac- ter, which sometimes corresponds to the Western standpoint of the second half of the 19th century.
