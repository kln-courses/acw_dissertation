The lengthening of vowels is represented thus: (short) i, (long) i:. With regard to writing these vowel sounds, a choice was before us. Egyptian speech follows perfectly regular and nicely observed rules as to the elision or shortening of vowels in relation to changing con- sonantal combinations. There is a continual delicate balancing of vowel values from the influence of one word and syllable upon another. Should writing represent these elisions and shortenings, which are, of the very genius of the spoken language ? (e.g. should a writer of spoken French give us the " je-n sais pas " that he hears, or the " je ne sais pas " that is intended ?) In Egyptian Arabic, the elisions, though strictly regular, are so numerous as to be confusing at first to the eye accustomed to regard each word as a unit, and these notes, intended rather to reveal the thought of the peasant speaker than the actual sound-quality of his sentence, give the vowel structure of each word as it is in pause, with the exception of a few shortenings in prepositional phrases and small connecting words. In the case of proper names and other Arabic words occurring in the English text of the notes, and not being quotations from peasant speech, I have used the transliteration scheme of the British Academy. These notes do not try to make any statement as to the position and nature of the jinn in Islamic theory, nor to give any account of the information, fascinating, gruesome, or tedious, to be found concerning them in Islamic literature. They seek, rather, to banish literary information and to look at the people of the jinn through the eyes of a fellah of the Menfifia Province of the Egyptian Delta. And this unbookish purpose must explain what would seem an unbalanced combination at the very outset. For the jinn and the ghoul, grouped together at the head of this paper, belong to different categories of beings; the jinn with a rank and status in the Islamic universe that is never given to the ghoul, who is but a more awful beast among the other beasts. But in the folk-stories of the Menfifieh fellh., and in his goblin- haunted mind, there is no hard dividing line between the powers and</page><page sequence="3">NOTES ON THE JINN AND THE GHOUL 423 the malicious pranks of what he variously but almost indis- criminately calls Jaja:*i:n, glinn, afari:t, ma:ridi:n and gu:l. All of these belong to the same cycle of ideas and stories, and to separate them, as books separate them, would be to represent a division that does not exist in the fellah's mind. All of them are for him, as Professor Macdonald says,1 "on a dividing line between fairies, brownies, kobolds, and true theological devils." In many of his stories all the above terms are freely interchangeable, although generally speaking the word Jajta:n 2 is the one chosen for the more individual and personal type of demon and the word 9u:l for the more purely bestial. The peasant through whose eyes we now try to see (and educated Egyptian friends will sympathize with the attempt) is not the boy who has been to school, but his illiterate brother or sister whose visible world is bounded by the fields and market-places of a corner of the teeming Egyptian Delta. To these non-readers, the great body of information on any subject will come through the common mind and the common mouth of the local community. Yet even for them there may be outside information, and it is necessary to ask how far such influences as the Qur'an, or the tales of professional story-tellers reciting Arabian Nights, or the information gleaned from specialists in magic, may be responsible for the peasant's view of the jinn. INFLUENCE OF THE QUR'AN The unlettered fellah does not know the Qur'an except liturgically. He knows the phrases of daily worship, although it is exceptional for his sister to do so. For the rest he responds to the sonority of Qur'an chanting-much as a European peasant might respond to the familiar chanting of holy psalms in Latin-with a response of the aesthetic or emotional side of his nature rather than of the intellectual. " Allah ! " says the fellah, " Allah! Allah! " and sways himself in true pleasure at the windings of the chanter's voice. But he would be at a loss to tell the matter of the chant, and cannot produce for the questioner any of the teaching of the Qur'an about the jinn. Yet the Book has its effect upon his jinn-beliefs, for he knows that the jinn are there, they are there in the holy Book. And so the Qur'an provides him with 1 Aspects of Islam, p. 330. 2 The same confusion exists in the peasants' use of this word as was noted by Goldziher in its use by the earlier Moslems. It means indiscriminately " die mit den Ginnen vollig identischen Seyt.nen der gahilijja und der mit dem jildisch-christlichen Iblis identischen geyt.n ". (Abuhandlungen zur Arabischen Philologie, 7.) In these notes the word is only used as a common, not a proper noun.</page><page sequence="4">424 CONSTANCE E. PADWICK- certainty that the jinn are included by Allah in the brotherhood of creation and in the framework of Islam. There is as secure a place for them in Allah's universe as for ourselves and the beasts and the angels. In a popular story of Khadra ash-sharifa printed in Cairo by Muhammad IHusain at Tarazi an introductory verse reads in translation : " Praise be to God the Merciful, who provides for men and the demons' flock, And for the birds, and all the fish, and for the worm inside of the rock." This is entirely typical of the popular mind in its accordance to the jinn of a place in the normal economy of creation and Providence. For the rest it is possible that a general tendency in current peasant stories to connect the jinn with fire may look back unconsciously to Surah xv, 26, 27 :- Certainly a strong connexion with fire is found in the peasant tales. The " ginni " may, for instance, appear as a man, but vanish away as a pillar of fire, as in the following example:-- ka:n fi:h wa:hid 'a:iz jisri qinab ?a:s nafsu i:n wi nizil li karm il 'inab wi sara? kiti:r ?awi, wi *iti' min ba:b il karm, wil 'inab fi ma3?af. wi huwa ma:ji fis sikka wagad ra:gil ?a:'id wi ma:sik siga:ra fi i:du. ?a:m Pa:l ir ra:gil li 1 hara:mi, "ta'a: ja gada'.

And on his way he found a man sitting with a cigarette in his hand who called out to the thief, " Come here, old chap!" He went to him, and the man said: " What's that in the basket ? " "Grapes," said the thief, much alarmed. "I want to divide them with you," said the man, who was an 'afri:t and he stretched out his hand and took the robber's hand, who felt his touch as though he were holding thorns or hedgehog spines.</page><page sequence="5">NOTES ON THE JINN AND THE GHOUL 425 wi tannu ma:fi wala:kin ba'dima mifi fwajja ?a:m rigi' 'alafan jidrab illi xad minnu 1 'inab. wi lamma Xalla be:nu w be:n in nafar il 'afri:t zejji mitr, sa:r if .fej-a:n na:r wi *ili' li s sama. And the 'afri:t went on divid- ing the grapes till he left the robber with only one bunch. The robber went his way in anger, but presently returned to fight for his grapes. And when he came as near as a metre to that 'afri:t person, the fejea:n turned into fire and ascended heavenwards. Or, even more usually, the 'afri:t is known by eyes of flame that shine out in the darkness large as saucers, as in the following example : wa:hid fellah fi minu:f kibi:r is sinni fwajja ?a:l li "ana fufti marra wa:hid mil ga:nn wi ka:n il ke:fijja kida. kutt amfi fi awa:Xir il le:l li 1 ge:A bita:'i. wi lamma futti 'ala sa:?ija mahgu:ra fi I ari:2 Jufti 'and is sa:?ija fi zala:m il le:l na:r tirtafi' marra wi tinXafat marra, wi xufti fwajja wala:kin ?arrabt i min mahall in na:r wi laJe:t fakl i insa:n, wi,n na:r di hija 'ene:h. ?a:m il insa:n illi hu:wa 'afri:t a:l li 'au:z minni: e:h ?" umt ana fi ga:jit il xo:f 'ult i lu "inta mi:n?" fa a:l li:l ginni "ma tis'alf." wi ba'di kida xadni: wi xalla:ni amfi ma'a:h li ihaddima laffifni hawale:n is sa:-ija. wi ka:n 'a:wuz jigdir bi: wi jiwa??aq ni fi s sa:?ija. wala:kin gire:t minnu, fa lahia~ni 1 ginni da wa iamalni w rafa'ni w rama:ni fi t tir'a wi ma kanJ fi:ha majja kiti:r. wi fa:t wa:hid ?urb is saba:hi tili 'ni mit tir'a. An elderly fell.h of Mentif said to me: " I saw one of the gann once, after this fashion. I was going in the last watches of the night to my field, and as I passed near a deserted sa:qiya on my way, I saw in the darkness of the night a fire burning at the sa:qiya, now flaring up and now dying down. I felt some fear of it, but I went up to the place where the fire was, and found the form of a man, and that fire was nothing but his eyes ! And the man, who was an 'afri:t, said, " What do you want with me ? " Terribly afraid Isaid: "Whoareyou?" "Do not ask," said the ginni. Then he took me and made me walk with him, bringing me round and round the sa:qiya, and his intention was to trick me and make me fall into the sa:qiya. But I ran away from him, and the ginni overtook me and picked me up and raised me and threw me into the canal, which was rather low. And about dawn somebody passed and pulled me out of the canal.</page><page sequence="6">426 CONSTANCE E. PADWICK- Even the peasant who makes no connexion in his mind between the information in the Qur'an and his theory of the jinn, has at least this link between the two, that he is well convinced that certain passages of the Holy Book are potent against his ghostly foes. They may be written on charms or repeated orally, always provided that he who uses them is mutawaddi?, tdhir. Hurrying past the ruined house, or the disused water-wheel, it is good to say the Chapter of " Sincerity " or " the Verse of the Throne ". It is curious to note that the Coptic fellahh, although unable to find information about the creation of the jinn in his Holy Book, has yet contrived a Scriptural origin for them. Does not the Book of Numbers say of Korah and his rebellious company that they went down alive into the pit when the earth opened her mouth to receive that company of evil-doers ? What, then, more probable than that these wicked ones should emerge still alive, and work evil upon the earth ? In fact, the evil jinn are no others than Korah, Dathan, and Abiram and all their progeny ! INFLUENCE OF " THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS" Taken as a whole, the Arabian Nights contain a considerable body of information on the believing and heretical jinn, their modes of appearance and disappearance, their enchantments, servitude, loves, and wars. It is possible to find many points of likeness between this informa- tion and the jinn-beliefs current in the Delta. But it is another matter to prove that the peasant borrowed jinn-ideas from the " Nights ", and on investigation this seems less and less likely. When all is said and done, the Arabian Nights is an urban work. The characters move in streets and palaces and the bazaars of the merchants. If they venture outside the cities they meet not with the life of the fellMhin, but with jinn and unearthly adventures. There are fishermen and gardeners in the Tales, but never a true fellah. And study of peasant tales in the Delta indicates that the fellahin have never made the Arabian Nights their own as the townsmen have. It is a striking fact that after inquiry, now extending over several years, about the stories current in the Delta, I have never once, on asking a fellah for a tale, met with one drawn from the Arabian Nights. On the other hand, in Cairo, servants and such-like, often produce hashed fragments of stories from the " Nights ". In spite, too, of the correspondence of many ideas about the jinn</page><page sequence="7">NOTES ON THE JINN AND THE GHOUL 427 in peasant tales and in the Arabian Nights, it is true to say that there are also marked differences. The jinn of the Arabian Nights have reached a higher stage of development than the jinn of the Delta fellih. They are more urbane and more individualized. The peasant has, as far as I can discover, no jinn with individual names like " the MArid Kashkash " or the " 'Afrit Dahnash son of Shemhfirish the Flver " (story of Prince Qamar ez Zaman). Certain names he has which at first seem to point to individualization, but which on closer study are found to be used as generic. Thus " ginni d duhr " is the name of any ginni that shows itself by day and a fellah in describing the shyness of present-day ginn will say, " In my grandfather's time this was waste ground, and you could see as many as sixty 'afrit id. duhr here any day." So also " ginni 1 bahr " seems a generic name for a type of hideous mermaid ginnija, responsible for all the accidental daylight drowning in the canals. " umm is subja:n " the 'afrlta that snatches or injures little children seems at first to come nearer personality. But I cannot discover any more individualization than that of her horrid preference for little innocent victims. She is not individualized as a person, but as an office. " umm is subja:n" is hardly more personal a name than " umm il gi:la:n ",1 which is the polite way of addressing any ghuila whatsoever. This practically complete lack of individualization in the Menufieh jinn stories perhaps indicates that we have here under our eyes an earlier stage of thought than that reached in the cities when the " Nights " were composed. Our jinn stories may be nearer those tales current before the Islamic civilization, of which Robertson Smith 1 Paul Kahle in his very interesting transcription of the Zar-ritual words (Zdr- Beschw6rungen in Agypten, Der Islam, 1912, p. 23) quotes a cry to a spirit called " Umm il Ghulam ", among the salutations to semi-satanic powers in both the Cairo and Luxor rituals. He thus explains the use of the term : " Umm el Ghulam (Mutter des Knaben) ist eine beriihmte Walija in Kairo, deren Heiligtum in der nach ihr benannten Strasse astlich von der GAme' el Hasanein leigt. Sie soll nach der Schlacht von Kerbela das Haupt Hus ns gefunden haben ; als man es von ihr forderte, habe sie ihrem eignen Sohn den Kopf abgeschlagen und den herausgegeben, das Haupt des Husen aber nach Kairo gebracht. Die Moschee, in der sie beerdigt ist, wird nur einmal im Jahre geaffnet, und zwar tine Nacht, vor der llet el-kebire des Mfilid des Husen. Darauf spielt das uba'uda an: jedes Jahr einmal mdge eine Zar-Beschwbrung veranstaltet werden. Auserdem ist aber die Umm el-GhulAm hier zu einem ZAr-Geist geworden." In spite of the fact that "11 umm il iula:m " is thus invoked in the Cairo and Luxor rituals, I have not so far been able to find that any Delta peasant has heard of her. A question about her is always corrected as though the questioner were stumblingly trying to say " umm el gi:la:n ", and some answer about the habits of the local gu:l is given.</page><page sequence="8">428 CONSTANCE E. PADW1CK- writes: " In the Arabian Nights we find jinn with individual names and distinctive personalities, but in the old legends (of Arabia) the individual jinni who may appear to a man has no more a distinct personality than a beast." 1 INFLUENCE* OF THE PROFESSIONAL MAGICIAN The'professional magician ('arrdf) in the Delta folk-tale is nearly always a Maghrabi. That is to say, he is not only, as is the sheikha (or " wise woman ") somewhat outside the common life by reason of uncanny knowledge direct from supernatural sources, but he is a foreigner as well, from the western land that is for the Egyptian the home of magic. Such people are specialists who in part hold the keys, or, at least, have the right of entry into the jinn world, and perhaps can summon at will their allies among the jinn; sallat is the word always used for such authoritative calling. These master-men may even control unseen powers by a finger gesture, as in the following example :- ka:n hiha e:h ? ra:gil bita:' il miJfat wi 1 fallija:t bi jibi:' fi e giba:l, igranni wa:'id ir ra:gil da wa:lhid gu:l min gi:la:n il giba:l innu wa~tima ka:n jibi:' il mifat jifawwar li 1 gu:1 li fo:?. fa Jawwar bi suba:'u wi bassi li fo:? wi nizil il gu:l illi sallatu. Who came here ? A pedlar of hair combs and vermin combs, selling in the mountains. Now you must know that his man had promised one of the mountain gu:1s that when he made a sale he would beckon to him up above. And he beckoned with his finger and looked upwards, and the gu:l whom he had summoned, descended. Jinn allies may reveal to the 'arrdf or sheikha the confidences which they caught when they listened at the curtain that veils the heavenlies, before the angels spied them and pelted them away with falling stars. Or these wise people may know instead the peculiar combinations of powerful names that will hold the jinn in check. In any case, it is safer for the fell~ah to buy a charm from them, and it is to their interest to keep the guardianship of mysteries, so that the sum-total of information gained from them as to jinn-nature is very tiny and practically amounts to a strong re-affirmation of the existence of dangerous powers against which charms are needed, and in particular a firmer belief in the power 1 Religion of the Semites, Lecture III.</page><page sequence="9">NOTES ON THE JINN AND THE GHOUL 429 of jinn to " possess ", or clothe themselves with (jiltabisu bi) human beings. This side of jinn-belief is the Sheikha's kingdom. Expert information, then, whether from the Qur'an reciter or the story-teller of the Arabian Nights, or from the professional Sheikha, is very scanty, and we now turn to examine the great body of popular belief which, whatever its original source, now survives and is propagated only in the folk-mind. BELIEFS IN THE POPULAR MIND Haunts of the Uncanny: (a) The Desert We do not in the villages talk about the green chrysolite mountains of Qaf beyond the Circumambient Ocean, nor of the City of Brass upon which the sun riseth not, as the abode of the spirits we fear. In this southern angle of the Delta we have in the place of those homes of fearful romance a dim grey line on the horizon beyond our familiar fields, the grey wall of the desert bounding our human activities, and visible from any housetop. In our popular stories, Arabs from out the desert play the part of mystery and outlawry that gipsies play in English stories. And the desert is the scene where we place supernatural encounters, as it was in the days of the Christian fathers and hermits of the Egyptian wilderness. Here you may meet the Saints:- a:lit li sitti: innaka ka:nit macfja fi 1 gabal wi bassi wahda tanja wajja:ha wi ?a:bilhum hlaramijja la:libi:n filu:shum. wi Xa:fu kiti:r 'alafan ka:nu sitta:t wi. 1 haramijja rajli:n jidurru- hum. wi saraXit sitti: bi so:t 'a:li "ja mari girgis! ja mari girgis !" fa la:lan gih be:nha w be:n il hlaramijja wa:hid la:bis libs abjad fi abjad wi ra:kib husa:n abjad. fa xa:fu 1 hiaramijja minnu wi harabu. fa ka:nit sitti qa:wuza tibussi i:du wala:kin hu:wa muf ra:di, ?a:l " ma'lehf " wi kallimha bismiha wi ba'di My grandmother told me that she was walking in the desert with only one other woman when robbers met them and demanded their money, and they were terrified, for they were women and the robbers meant to injure them.

And the robbers fled in fear. And my grandmother wanted to kiss the horseman's VOL. III. PART III. 29</page><page sequence="10">430 CONSTANCE E. PADWICK- nussi sa:'a ra:h 'ala gafla wi ma Ja:fitu:J wala tiusa:nu. hand, but he was unwilling, and said: " Never mind," and talked with her, calling her by her name. And after about half an hour, suddenly he disappeared, and she saw no trace of him or of his steed. The desert, too, is the haunt of all the tribes of jinn, the 'afarit, the maridin, and more especially of the ghcl. In the example already quoted of the pedlar who summoned an ally of the ghfils, this was called " wahid ghal min ghilan il gibal ". The tale goes on to relate how the ghfil snatched a maiden and carried her off to his house in the desert-mountains where only a few camel trains passed; and the maiden sang in her loneliness :- ka:nit wida:'a galja sabahit wida:'a garja fi wus- il giba:l il 'alja. Once Wida'a had plenty Now Wida'a's a slavey In the midst of mountains lofty. Here, apparently, a real mouintain must be intended, but in general the word " gabal " in the Delta stories stands for the desert, and carries with it no more mountainous meaning than the rise of the low desert hills or sand dunes beyond the flat cultivated fields. It is interesting to note that while 'afarit constantly inhabit places within the village boundaries, the home of the ghfils is always the desert, though they may come down into the village street at night sniffing for blood. Here is an encounter at midnight :- ?a:bilha 1 gu:l fi nuss is sikka, ga ji'affar wi jinaff wi ?al laha "a:kulik hina walla afi:l 'a:l ?uru:n awaddi:hi 1 gabal?" . . . wi fa:lha 1 gu:l 'ala ?uru:nu wi xadha 1 gabal fi Xuseu w hattaha fi:h. The gu:l met her in the middle of the street and, raging and snorting, said :-" Shall I eat you here or carry you on my horns to the desert ? "-and the ghoul carried her on his horns and took her to his rush hut in the desert, and put her inside it. Just as in reading the stories of the fathers of the desert, it is very hard to resist the inference that some of the apparitions of evil ones were visits of wild beasts to the cave where the tense-strung hermit fasted in awful solitude, so in hearing the stories of Egyptian peasant encounters with jinn or ghils, it is difficult not to infer that many such stories are based on meetings with wild beasts in the terrors of desert</page><page sequence="11">NOTES ON THE JINN AND THE GHOUL 431 solitude. Those terrors, it must be remembered, are overwhelming to an Egyptian fellah whose normal life from birth to death is lived in a social crowd. Such a creation of night terrors, in which the narrator is perfectly unconscious that he creates, can be seen in the following account from the village of Subk. Here, surely, the jinn tradition is caught growing under our very eyes from the terrors of darkness and solitude and an encounter with a pariah puppy. ka:n hina ra:gil gada' awi ma kanji wa:hiid zejju f subk wi ?al li " ana fufti farXamin il gann. kutt,aru:h il ge:* bi 1 la:l fi~a:Xir if fahr wi d dunja 'atma, wi ?a:bilni ginni faklu kalbi kibi:r wi ?ulti lu "1 Ca:wuz minni ?e:h ?

There was a very hefty fellow here, no man like him in Subk. And he said : " I saw one of these jinn-birds. I was going to my field at night, at the end of the month when nights were dark, and a jinni met me in the form of a big dog. I said to him : ' What do you want of me ?' He only panted, and his eyes were large as saucers. I picked him up and carried him in my bosom as far as my field and put him down on the ground, after which I saw him no more, and nothing happened to me because I had taken him into my bosom, but if I had struck him or been hard on him, he would have killed me." The peasant's phrase, " farxa min il ga:nn" is riiore suggestive of animal existence than of personality. But while jinn stories may bear this suggestion of wild-beast origin, still more is this the case with the ghlil of the mountains. On this point Professor Robertson Smith makes an interesting note on Arabic phraseology 1 :- " The Arab says 'the ghfil appeared', not 'a ghfil appeared', just as David says 'the lion came and the bear' (1 Sam. xvii, 34; Amos iii, 12 ; v, 19). The definite article is used because in such cases definition cannot be carried beyond the indication of the species. The individuals are numerically different, but qualitatively indistinguish- able. This use of the article is sharply to be distinguished from such 1 Religion of the Semites, Lecture III, n. 15.</page><page sequence="12">432 CONSTANCE E. PADWICK- a case as WIV in 1 Sam. ix, 9, where the article is generic, and a general practice of men is spoken of." I have never found this usage departed from by Delta peasants in speaking of the gu:l. Indeed, a fellah told me that the difference between an 'afri:t and a gu:l was that the former often took human form, the latter always wild beast form. Peasant stories do not always bear this out. In the general confusion as to the exact nature of these evil powers, no strict dividing line is possible,. and there are some stories in which the gu:l seems to be undergoing domestication and anthropomorphosis without losing the heart of a beast. In one of the most popular of all the Delta stories a gu:la appears as a bad old woman with a magic well under her power. When little girls are sent to borrow the sieve from her, she tests their characters by ordering them to comb the vermin from her hair. Those who are polite under these circumstances are rewarded by embroidered raiment from the magic well, and chains of gold. Those who fail in politeness are sent away, garbed in clinging lizards, snakes, and frogs. Here the gu:la has become an old witch with human form and straggling white hair. In another story, which seems to show that the gu:l may have human forms, he sucks blood from a maiden's finger every day, upon which her brothers lie in wait and kill him, and having cut up his body, sell it to his wife and children as fish for dinner. When they came to cook the fish :- il bint is sugajjara wagadit suba:' abu:ha wi ?a: lit 1 ummaha " suba:' abu:ja hina, jamma ". the little girl found her father's finger and said to her mother: " This is father's finger, mother." Perhaps a missing link between the wild beast gu:l of the desert and this anthropomorphic type was some gorilla in the Cairo Zoological Gardens, for MenUif people have earnestly assured me that a gu:la was on show there; only, with the usual elusiveness of such beasts, she proves upon inquiry to have died some years ago. (b) Watery Haunts The Egyptian peasant does not, like his brother of Palestine, place an 'afrit in every well; his waters have not the mystery of mountain springs. But beside any of the larger canals may be found at summer noondays, ginni-l-bahr, who snatches unwary bathers to their doom. Very often in woman's form, letting down masses of matted hair, this ginniya sits at the water's edge, ugly as sin. She has no power unless</page><page sequence="13">NOTES ON THE JINN AND TIlE GHOUL 433 you are alone. But if you are alone she calls to you " Come here ", and then " Take my hand ", and leads you down under the water. " ginni d duhr" seems to be an alternative title for this snatcher of noontide bathers, who probably has had long dominion in Egypt, for it is worthy of note that in the Baptism Service of the Coptic Church, prayer is made that those about to be baptised may be defended " from all the darts of the enemy, and from evil assaults, and from the demon of noon- tide, and from the arrow that flieth by day, and from the thing that walketh in darkness, and from the imaginations of the night."' In spite of the general recollection of Ps. xci, 5, 6, in this petition, the definite phrase " demon of noontide " would seem to point to some definite and known belief in the Egypt of those days. Perhaps the most assured home of the jinn in Egyptian peasant eyes is the disused water-wheel. A friend in Menuf who studied eight years in the Azhar and four years in the Government training college for teachers, but spent his childhood amongst the fellMhin, told me, " To this day when I am walking in the fields, if I come to a saqiya not in use, I tremble. And if no one is walking with me, I wait on the path till someone comes up, so that I shall not have to pass the place alone."

One day I went to the village near the well and found all the women wailing. They told me Muhammed son of so and so, had been thrown by the jinn into the haunted well. He had been out at night. He was well and sober, and no one had a grudge against him. There was no reason why he should have strayed off the path and fallen into the well. I went to the place and found a great crowd, and the man's body lying in the water hole. After- wards, they made a wall round the place that no one should approach it. But they built the wall too low, and a .water buffalo went over it and was found dead in the well. (c) Ruins A ruined house, as any other desolate and forlorn place, is jinn haunted.

" I went at noon into an unin- habited house, old (and disused), and I went all alone into a dark room, and felt movement in the room, but did not see anything.

A woman went alone into a dark room and found in it forty little boys clothed in white and wearing tarbouches. She was terribly frightened, but they said : " So long as you tell no one about us, we will do you no harm, but bring you whatever you want." She asked them for all her desires, and her husband marvelled to see her grow rich. When he plagued her as to the source of her riches, and suspected her of the worst conduct, he drove her at last to tell him the truth, and from the day in which she was compelled to tell the secret, they made her a cripple and left her and all her riches vanished away, and she had no more from that source." (e) Latrines are also jinn-haunted places, for the folk say that their two guardian angels 1 go with them into all places but these, and hence leave them here exposed to the attacks of evil ones. (f) Cemeteries, again, are invariably shaitan-haunted. You should never go alone to the Coptic cemetery outside Menfif, nor visit it at night, or the shaijatin will, says the fellAh, " jimawwitu:k wi jiat-acu:k " (kill you and chop you into little bits). (g) Trees in the Egyptian Delta are more often saint-haunted than jinn-haunted. Paradise, say the fallahin, is surrounded by a hedge of the nubq (zizyphus spina-Christi), as any pleasant fruit-garden near our villages will have its prickly hedge. A nubq-tree of considerable 1 Strictly speaking these should be recording angels, but since they are holy powers, they are regarded as guardians against jinn.</page><page sequence="16">436 CONSTANCE E. PADWICK---- age will always be haunted by a saint. It is not, however, unknown with us for a labakh-tree (colloquially we generally call it labbaX, acacia mimosa) to be jinn-haunted or masku:na. Such a tree will be used in the same way as a saint-haunted one, and barren women will walk round and round it praying for conception, and buffaloes with insufficient milk may also be led round it. MODES OF SUMMONING JINN Although the jinn often visit mankind at their own will, or may entice him for their own pleasure towards their haunts, there are also several ways of summoning them which, if used clumsily or unintentionally, may result in their appearing in the worst of tempers. Thus, in calling to a friend, it is of importance to beckon with the finger to the exact individual intended, for fear hovering jinn should take the call as for themselves. In the same way, in calling to a beast, one should indicate with the finger the beast required for fear of summoning a jinni. " The old men told me this when I was a boy," said my informant, " but we don't think much about it now." Another belief that is waning is the old idea familiar to us through a famous story in the Arabian Nights, that to throw anything, such as a date stone, to the earth with violence was a dangerous act, for fear of striking a lurking jinni. This idea is enshrined in our Delta folk-stories, as when seven sons refused to kiss their father's hand until he found them brides, and he replied:- kulli wa:hid minkum ja:xud giri:du w jirmi:h fi ajji mahiall, wi min kulli mahall suu:* il gari:d titla' lu 'aru:sa. Let each of you take his stick of palm-leaf rib, and throw it down anywhere, and from the place where your stick 'falls there will rise up a bride for you (a jinniya). But though this idea is often repudiated, there does certainly live on a sense of the danger of striking with violence and disturbing jinn in their haunts. A student told the following story to the Rev. H. E. E. Hayes, of Menuif. "A relative of mine was a student who sat at his books till late. One night, having worked till midnight, he threw from his bedroom windows dirty water and polluted a ginniya who was in the street below and cried out, 'I will punish'. From that time a woman with eyes of fire haunted the street, and four or five days later, finding my cousin in the street alone, she seized him by the throat and would</page><page sequence="17">NOTES ON THE JINN AND THE GHOUL 437 have throttled him, had not his mother run up to his help. After that she was quiet again." The greatest danger from such disturbance of the jinn is that they may in revenge " possess " the disturber. In an article by VQllers,1 an Egyptian correspondent is quoted who lays bare this danger exactly as it exists in the mind of the Menufieh peasant to-day. These are possibilities, but there is one certain mode of evoking a shaitan. In all cases of murder or violent death, when the blood of the slain touches the earth, there rises from it (as in most of these cases of evocation it is from the earth that the jinni rises) a shaitin who is not the ghost of the murdered one, but is exactly in his likeness, speaks with his voice, and haunts his haunts. Thus, in a village street where a great Bey killed three slaves, their voices may yet be heard, though the shayatin who make the cries are not their ghosts. A girl fell from a balcony in Menfif and was killed. It was necessary for the mistress of the house to fetch the Coptic priest (the girl being a Copt) to exorcize the Shait.n before the Moslem neighbours would be satisfied that the house was not haunted by a demon in the girl's form. Lane (Modern Egyptians, chap. x) says that the term 'afrlt is applied to the ghost of a dead person. On first sight this would seem to be so, but Egyptian friends are careful to insist that these spirits which appear in cases of violent death, are not the spirits of the slain, but 'afarit in the slain one's form. The belief is closer to the idea of the qarina, the " double " in the spirit world, than to that of the return of the human spirit to earthly haunts. This belief is, so far 1 Vollers, " Noch einmal der Zar " : Z.D.M.G., vol. xlv, p. 343.</page><page sequence="18">438 CONSTANCE E. PADWICK-- as I know, the only one among our people in which the jinn attain to anything like real personality, and it seems to belong to a different range of ideas from those concerning the wild-beast jinn. MODES OF MANIFESTATION 1. Animal Forms.-While the ghoul is in essence a wild beast of the desert, the jinn may assume the forms of more familar beasts. " BacL il kila:b mil ginn " the people say, and a jinni often chooses the form of a cat, a great cat, sometimes, that towers up to heaven, with burning eyes. (The black cat is, of course, the special form of the qarina.) Riding Beasts.-Mules or donkeys may also be jinn-forms, and round these gathers a cycle of stories of ridden jinn. These jinn, who are beasts of burden perhaps mark a stage in which thought is passing from a wild-beast conception to a personified conception of the jinn. " Just as animal gods pass over into anthropomorphic gods, figured as riding on animals or otherwise associated with them, the jinn begin to be conceived as manlike in form, and the supernatural animals of the original conception appear as the beasts on which they ride." 1 These beasts of burden sometimes allow themselves to be ridden by Beni Adam, being under the control of those who recognize them and know that they are afraid of " cold iron ". The following story was recently told to the Rev. H. E. E. Hayes, of Menfif :- " About 53 years ago the Gindi family were, as they now are, notables of Menf^f. And as they were sitting in the Maglis el Baladiya a question occurred which needed an answer from a notable of Tanta. A servant of the Gindi family was told to go to Tanta and bring back an answer. He had to ride, for the railway was not yet made. As he passed the old cemetery of Menfif he saw a donkey saddled ready for a journey. No owner was visible, and the servant determined to take him for the business of the notables. He seized the rein and mounted the beast, which at once put down its head and threw him off. 'You must be a jinni,' said the servant, and quick as thought took a pen- knife from his pocket, opened it, and put the blade to the donkey's neck. At once the beast became submissive, and said :-' Where do' you want to go ? '-' Tanta.'-' Then cover your head and ears with your garments.' He did so, and in five minutes found himself in Tanta. He handed in the letter to the notable and refused to dismount even for coffee, but remained sitting on the donkey with 1 Robertson Smith, Religion of the Semites, Lecture III.</page><page sequence="19">NOTES ON THE. JINN AND. THE GHOUL 439 his knife-blade on its neck, until he received the answer. He returned to Meni^f as fast as he came, dismounted at the door of the Maglis, left the donkey, which instantly disappeared, and entered the meeting of notables. They rebuked him, saying, 'We sent you to Tanta. Make haste, it is time you started.' He replied, 'If I go to Tanta and come back with an answer in half an hour what will you give me ? ' Jestingly they all named a sum, whereupon he produced his letter and told his tale, and received from them the promised money." This story is placed back fifty years in time, but the following was told me of a fella^h now living, who is deeply insulted at the suggestion that his experiences might have taken place in a dream world :- ra:gil fella:hi arag min be:tu f a:Xir il le:l jiru:h il ge:-. fa wagad huma:r gami:l fiLs sikka wi fi:h liga:m. ?a:m rikibu fa wagad il hacraka ge:r il a:da fa'irif innu qafri:t mil ginn. wi garaz fi kitfu matwa wi kallimu wi ?a:l " waddi:ni misr ". fa wadda:h fi mudda a-si:ra va:lis. wi talab il fella:l jirga' il be:t fa ragga'u fi.1 ha:1. wi 'andama wa-sal il be:t cala' il matwa min kitf il hluma:r. wa fi s saba:h fattaf 'ale:h, ma wagadu:J abadan. A fellah left his house towards the end of the night to go to his field. And he found in the road a fine donkey bridled. He mounted but found the motion unusual, and knew that it must be an 'afrilt of the jinn. And he dug a penknife into its shoulder and spoke to it, and said : " Take me to Cairo." And he was conducted there in the briefest space of time. Then he asked to return to his house and the jinni brought him back instantly. And when he reached home he drew the knife out of the donkey's shoulder. And in the morning, though he searched for the beast, he found him no more. Snakes.-I do not think that snakes in the Delta come into the cycle of jinn-ideas, though they have a very important place in magical ideas. The snake in the house is called sa:kin il be:t, as though human beings were the intruders, and he the rightful owner. Great care must be taken to protect the snake family. The zir must not be left uncovered for fear one of them should fall into it. For so. long as the snake family are well, they will do no harm to the human family, but the death or injury of one of the snake inhabitants will be revenged on the human inhabitants of the house.</page><page sequence="20">440 CONSTANCE E. PADWICK-- In the Delta stories I have not met with a snake which is a true jinni (as in the story of the First of the Three Ladies of Baghdad or Abu Muhammad the Lazy, in the Arabian Nights), but the snake has an undoubted connexion, in these folk-tales, with magic. There is a snake-bridegroom (il hanash abu 'urnen, the Egyptian horned viper) who creeps into the bride-chamber by a hole in the wall, and can be turned into a prince by the trust of a human bride who will without fear suffer him to coil his snaky folds about her. Whether we have, in the Delta peasant's reverence for snakes, some relic of pre-Islamic and pre-Christian religion, is for experts to decide. 2. Showers from above The strange manifestations by brick-throwing mentioned in Lane's Modern Egyptians, chap. x (p. 231 Everyman Edition) can be matched in the stories of to-day. Jinn often show their presence by showering stones from above. The following very circumstantial story was told in Menfif, but placed in Upper Egypt : " In Upper Egypt a man was much startled by stones falling through the roof of his house of sunbaked bricks. For several nights in succes- sion showers of stones came through the roof, and when he could find no thrower and no cause for the visitation, he went to the Ma'mfir. " The Ma'mfir attributed the throwing to the action of spirits, and wrote a message, which was left the following night in the room where the showers occurred, asking what the throwers of stones wanted. In the morning, they were found to have written on the paper that they were people of the jinn who required that house in which to celebrate a wedding. "The owner of the house again took counsel with the Ma'mfir, who wrote a second message asking the jinn to pay rent of ?15. This was far beyond the value of the place, for it was a poor man's house. In the morning fifteen golden sovereigns of English money were found beside the paper. The owner of the house took the money and moved himself and his family to a hut near by. Each night for forty nights, sounds of music and rejoicing were heard in his former dwelling. Afterwards, all was quiet and he returned and took up his abode, and was no more troubled." 3. Hostile Pranks There is a range of activities of the jinn, which, while not acts of deadly enmity and greed for blood, like those of the ghoul, can only</page><page sequence="21">NOTES ON THE JINN AND THE GHOUL 441 be described as malicious pranks. In the stories of the fellahin, these tricks are often freakish interruptions of the work of the fields :- ka:n fi:h ra:gil gani 'andu ra:'i wa jo:m min do:l Xadir ra:'i 1 baha:jim wi ra:l il ge:A raba* il baha:jim fi 1 barsi:m. wi ka:n kullima raba* il baha:jim jagidha ba'di Jwajja mahlu:la. fa wi ?if muthajjir iatta 1 le:l, fa 'and il maghib Iialli 1 baha:jim wi mifi f sikka fa gih if fe:*a:n wi a-aa' il habli min be:n ir ra:gil wi min be:n ganu:sa. fa ral ir ra:'i lil be:t wi la~a satiib il baha:jim ?a:'id 'and il ba:b. fa sa'al il xadda:m wi ?al lu "fe:n il gemu:s ?

A rich man had a herdsman who went one day to the field with the cattle, and tethered them in the clover. And no sooner did he tether them than he would find them loosed again. And he was perplexed by this all day. And at sunset he loosed the cattle and took his homeward path, and the Se:*a:n who had been playing these tricks came and cut the rope by which he was leading one of the water-buffaloes. And the herdsman returned to the house and found the owner of the cattle sitting at the door. He asked his servant: " Where are the buffaloes ? " "Here they are with me." Then the owner said: " One buffalo is missing," and he beat that servant,, and said: " Get along with you, go and look for the missing buffalo." The servant returned weeping to the field, taking with him a dog that ran in front of him, till they reached the place, and lo! there was the buffalo grazing clover at night, and a fe:-a:n beside her. The man trembled with fear and could neither return to the house without the buffalo nor venture into the field to take her from the Je:-a:n.

There was once a fellah who was watering his plot, and every time he went to turn the water into a fresh set of runlets, he found that it was not flowing. And he was surprised at the failure of the water, and when lhe looked for the cause, he found a fe:ta:n putting bricks into his irrigation trench and blocking it. He moved the bricks from the trench, but as fast as he did so, the fe:-a:n put them back. Then the fellah sat down very angry by the canal. And the 5e:-a:n came and said: "What are you doing ?" "Water- ing my plot." "Come down into the water," (of the canal) said the fe:-ta:n, and when the peasant refused, he seized him and rolled him in the mud and disappeared. And the fellah returned to his house a sick man. Another cycle of these pranks is concerned with interruptions to men going to prayer whether in the mosque or the Coptic Church. A man in Menfif on his way to morning prayer saw a baby crying in the road, picked it up, put it on his shoulder, carried it home to his wife and said : " Take care of it till the mother comes, shame upon her for leaving it in the street." The woman, who was nursing her own babe, put it down on the mat and took up the foundling, and the man went late to prayer. As she laid the foundling babe to her breast, it grew and grew beneath her eyes till it became about as large as a full-grown man. She flung it away and fainted. When the man came back from prayer he found his wife in a swoon and no trace of the foundling. 4. Possession Pranks in which a jinni plays the part of a clumsy Robin Goodfellow, without his sense of fitness and humour, are the least serious modes of self-manifestation. The modes which keep the fella.h, and still more</page><page sequence="23">NOTES ON THE JINN AND THE GHOUL 443 the fellaha, in a real bondage of fear are those concerned with sickness, most of which can be placed, from the peasant's point of view, under the heading of " possession ", although sometimes in cases of violent accidents, the jinn are understood to be merely murderous agents from without, as in the instance already mentioned of a girl who fell from a balcony, when Menftf opinion had it that a jinni had thrown her down. From the moment of birth when the midwife names Mohamed and 'Ali over the child to preserve him from the jinn; through all the ceremonies of the seventh day, directed towards saving the child from those " mulfk " who are hovering ready to harm; until, in his last sickness, bread is laid under his pillow, that the life-giving properties of it and the wholesomeness of the salt therein may keep off shaiyatin, the fellah is conscious of foes ready not only to harm him from without, but to seize on his very person, clothe themselves with it, and to harm him from within. The patients in Menfif hospital do not hesitate to attribute all sorts of physical troubles, from a tubercular hip to pneumonia, to an 'afrit resident in the afflicted part. The mysteriousness of madness and epilepsy have, of course, always lent colour to the fear of possession on which is built the marvellous popularity and general spread of the Zar-ritual despite the hostility of ecclesiastical authorities. That this probably Abyssinian ritual is comparatively new in Egypt is proved by the fact that Lane's works with all their fulness of detail on cognate subjects never mention what is to-day one of the great features of non-official, popular religion, unauthorized by Islam. The Zar-exorcism is carried on in Menfif not only among purely illiterate fellahin, but in such houses as those of the postal officials. The type of illness to which it is specially applied is thus described by the same Egyptian correspondent of Dr. Karl Vollers quoted above : dU' ,;l 1*,.. AAA&gt; . _. ,2 ,dU b..,; I Y00 ?, t 3rC. LL; J t..,,..d '</page><page sequence="24">444 CONSTANCE E. PADWICK- ..-74 - ... Not only such abnormal states, but almost all types of disease are at~tributed to jinn possession. Thus, a saint's tomb in the middle of Menfif is visited by women every Friday, who say that she who sits in the holy place will have-driven from her " the jinni of trembling ", i.e. the shivering fits of fever. This habit of " clothing " themselves with human bodies as their tormented hosts, leads us into quite a different range of thought from that in which the jinn snatch and murder and seem to us to betray wild beast origins. Yet this second range of thought is ancient enough among Semitic peoples, and on its happier side of possession as the cause of poetic or artistic inspiration, it entered literature, as Gold- ziher has taught us from pre-Moslem Arab thought. What further origins it may have had for the Delta fellah, in old Egyptian thought, experts must tell us. The present significance of possession is nearly always hostile. Yet there are perhaps the faintest traces of that old belief that any mysterious human powers, above the normal, were due to the working of the jinn, and especially the magic weaving of words by the poet. " Nicht die legendendichtende Nachwelt allein ist es, die der poetischen Kraft des Hasan (Hasan b. Thabit) diesen iibermenschlichen Ursprung zuschreibt. So wie er sich auch sonst auf seinen "Bruder von den Ginnen " beruft, der ihm seine Worte kunstvoll " webt" (Diwan HIasan b. Thabit, 39, 4), sagt er einmal ganz deutlich, dass ihm manche gewichtige Qafiya zu nachtlicher Zeit vom Himmel herab entgegen- komme : Any idea of beneficent inspiration, or "possession " like this " possession " of the poet, for the good of the possessed, is nearly dead in the Egyptian Delta. There is a lingering, all but forgotten belief that the art of carving the ivory and ebony screens of the Coptic Churches of Old Cairo with their wealth of fine and tender detail was 1 AbhandIungen zur Arabischen Philoloqie, p. 3, Goldziher.</page><page sequence="25">NOTES ON THE JINN AND THE GHOUL 445 taught by good Jinn who learnt it in Paradise. And there is a common saying among the fellahin that the Pyramids, too great for man to make, were the work of Gann ibn Gann. But for the rest the whole jinn tradition now alive in this corner of the Delta is one of hostile forces. Jinn do not inspire, they seduce to destruction. They only " possess " to destroy, and not to enable. The Qarina.-No account of the jinn in our fellah's mind would come near truth which left out his weird and sinister fear of the qarina, very rarely openly referred to, but taking a large place in life.1 From the moment of conception of every human babe a shaitan or 'afrlt of the jinn is set apart as its twin-spirit. The relationship is a most strange one, for while, on the one hand, the spirit-mate (whose sex is the opposite of that of the babe) may envy, with malignant eye the good fortune of its earth-mate and may cause its illness and death (hence many visits of pregnant mothers to the sheikha to buy charms against the qarina), yet on the other hand any damage done to the spirit-mate will harm the human partner. Thus, we have a cycle of stories in Menfif of blows struck at cats by night (when the qarina prowls in animal form, especially that of a black cat) with resultant illness of human babes next morning. The fellahin say that one should never strike any beast after sunset for fear of damaging a human child. The Rev. H. Hayes recounts a story as told him by a most intelli- gent fellh~bin family in Menfif, of a cat that one of the daughters of the house shut up in a corn-bin by night. " Next day their neighbour's child was ill, and the sickness could not be diagnosed. The mother sent the town-crier round, begging anyone who had shut up a cat during the night to release it. Then the girl remembered the cat she had shut in the bin. She ran up and released it. It ran to the house where the sick child lay, and immediately it entered the house the child recovered and told its mother that it had been shut up in a corn-bin." It is easily seen that this cycle of ideas on the qarina-a sort of extended personality through which one can be hurt, and at the same time a sort of intimate enemy by which one can be hurt-plays a very large part in the life of the fellahin, and especially of the women as guardians of little helpless lives. Our peasants all understand the use of the word qarlna in this particular connexion, although it has had a far nobler use in regard to the spirit world in older Arabic. 1 I am not able to judge of the alluring theory that this belief is a survival of the ancient Egyptian " Ka ".

(Tab. i, 1248, ult. 1249, 10).1 From such uses the word has fallen to the sinister meaning described above. But the fellah does not use it much. With the usual euphemy due to fear, which leads him to refer to the jinn as the " mu:lu:k" and to one possessed as 'aru:sit iz za:r, he will speak of the qarina as the " sister " or the " brother " of the human babe. When a child has died, its illness being due to the hostile envy of the qarlna, the account given is " gat uxtu dtarabitu" or " gih aXu:ha Xanaiha ". In this qarina belief, we find a strange linking of the two main tendencies already noted in the peasant's jinn ideas. The one strain of ideas tends to separate the jinn from personality and ally them with the beasts of the waste; the other tends to clothe them in human personality, either by the mode of " possession ", or, as in the case of the shait'n of the murdered, by an imitation of all the characteristics of an individual. In the strange and powerful belief concerning the qarina, the two strains meet. The spirit is distinct and personal, set apart as the familar (albeit the hostile familiar) of one human spirit. At the same time, its mode of manifestation is through the animal form that it adopts every night. Here is a deeply seated belief which has not yet received the study that it deserves, either from professed students of such matters or from those who aim at a more sympathetic understanding of lives as they are lived under the Egyptian sun.
