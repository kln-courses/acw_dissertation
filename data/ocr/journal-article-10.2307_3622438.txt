<plain_text><page sequence="1">RABBI SHIMON BEN ZEMAH DURAN ON THE PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM: OHEV MISHPAT, CHAPTERS VIII AND IX BY MENACHEM KELLNER Rabbi Shimon ben Zemah Duran (1361-1444) was one of the leading halakhists of the fifteenth century.' He is less well known as a philosopher,2 although his contributions to Jewish dogmatics are usually discussed, if only briefly, by students of the subject.3 Duran's discussion of the dogmas of Judaism is found primarily in chapters VIII and IX of his Ohev Mishpat,4 ' He is the author of an important collection of responsa, Tashbez [Teshuvot Shimon ben Zemah] (Amsterdam, 1738-1741). Isidore Epstein describes Duran's halakhic work in The Responsa of R. Simon ben Zemach Duran as a Source of the History of the Jews in North Africa (London, 1930). 2 On Duran as a philosopher see Heinrich Jaulus, "Simon ben Zemach Duran," MGWJ, 23 (1874), pp. 241-259, 308-317, 355-366, 398-412, 447-463, and 499-514; Jakob Guttmann, "Die Stellung des Simeon ben Zemah Duran in der jiidischen Religionsphilosophie," MGWJ, 52 (1908), pp. 641-672 and 53 (1909), pp. 46-79 and 199-228; and Nahum Arieli, "Mishnato ha-Philosophit shel R.

The Ohev Mishpat is a commentary on Job. It was written in 1405 (see Jaulus, p. 453). The commentary itself is preceded by an introductory treatise consisting of an introduction and thirty-five chapters. The book was first published in Venice in 1590 together with the Mishpat Zedek of Obadiah ben Jacob Sforno (c.1470-c.1550). The Venice edition was photographically reproduced in Tel Aviv in 1970.

This text is usually studied, if at all, for its influence on Joseph Albo's Sefer ha-Ikkarim5 and not for its own sake. Indeed, Julius Guttmann has argued that Duran's main ideas are taken from Averroes and that, in effect, Duran makes no independent contribution to the question of the dogmas of Judaism.6 It is my intention in this essay to argue that Duran's discussion does not show any evidence of Averroes' influence and that Duran makes a significant and independent contribution to the question of the dogmas of Judaism. It is well known that the whole issue of the principles of Judaism was first raised in the medieval world by Moses Maimonides (1135-1204). In his celebrated commentary to the first Mishnah of Sanhedrin X (Perek Helek) Maimonides enumerates thirteen principles7 of faith: (1) that God exists; (2) that God is one; (3) that God is incorporeal; (4) that God is treatise, was published a second time in Moses Frankfurt's Kehillot Moshe (Amsterdam, 1724-1727). The text of that edition is based upon the editio princeps. All references to the Sefer ha-Ikkarim of Joseph Albo (15th century) will be to the five-volume edition of Isaac Husik (Philadelphia, 1946). Albo and Duran were contemporaries and there is some disagreement over who influenced who. The bulk of scholarly opinion, however, holds that Duran influenced Albo. See Julius Guttmann, "L'Heker ha-Mekorot shel Sefer ha-Ikkarim," Studies in Memory of Asher Gulak and Samuel Klein (Jerusalem, 1942), pp. 57-75. This article was reprinted in the Tel Aviv, 1964 edition of the Sefer ha-Ikkarim (pp. 915-964) and in Guttmann's Dat u-Madda (Jerusalem, 1955), pp. 169-191. All references below are to this last edition. Guttmann discusses the relationship of Albo to Duran in note 2 on p. 169. 6 See the essay by Julius Guttmann, cited in the previous note, and the discussion below. Guttmann is followed in this hypothesis by Nahum Arieli (see above, note 2), p. 16 and by Colette Sirat, Hagut Philosophit bi-Y'mei ha-Benaim (Jerusalem, 1975), pp. 432-433. Guttmann repeats his thesis in Philosophies of Judaism (New York, 1973), pp. 279-280. 1 Two themes predominate in the terminology of medieval Jewish dogma- tics: the architectural and the botanical. Dogmas are called yesod (foundation), amud (column, pillar), pinah (cornerstone); they are also called shoresh and ikkar (root) and anaf and se'if (branch). The most common expression is ikkar which I translate as 'principle'.</page><page sequence="3">[3] SHIMON B. ZEMAH DURAN: PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM 233 eternal, a parte ante; (5) that God alone may be worshipped; (6) that prophecy exists; (7) that the prophecy of Moses is superior to all other prophecy; (8) that the Torah was divinely revealed; (9) that the Torah is immutable; (10) that God knows the deeds of men; (11) that God rewards the righteous and punishes the wicked; (12) that the Messiah will come; (13) that the dead will be resurrected.8 Maimonides insists that these thirteen beliefs are dogmas in the strict sense of the term: belief in them is a necessary condition for salvation. He writes: When a man believes in all these fundamental principles, and his faith is thus clarified, he is then part of that "Israel" whom we are to love, pity, and treat, as God commanded, with love and fellowship. Even if a Jew should commit every possible sin, out of lust or mastery by his lower nature, he will be punished for his sins but will still have a share in the world to come. He is one of the "sinners of Israel." But if a man gives up any of these fundamental principles, he has removed himself from the Jewish community. He is an atheist, a heretic, an unbeliever who "cuts among the plantings."9 We are commanded to hate him and to destroy him. Of him it is said. "Shall I not hate those who hate Thee, O Lord?" (Psalms 139:21)."? Maimonides' statement of the dogmas of Judaism initiated a wide discussion of the question. The reaction to Maimonides' statement was complex. Some scholars, Isaac Abravanel preeminent among them, rejected the Maimonidean project altogether, insisting that all the beliefs of Judaism were of equal significance and that it was therefore illegitimate to 1 For an English version of Maimonides' text, see the translation of A. J. Wolf in Isadore Twersky (ed.), A Maimonides Reader (New York, 1972), pp. 401-423 On Maimonides' dogmas, see Arthur Hyman, "Maimonides' 'Thir- teen Principles'," in Alexander Altmann (ed.), Jewish Medieval and Renais- sance Studies (Cambridge, 1967), pp. 119-144.

Many of the scholars who accepted Maimonides' overall claim that the Jewish faith did have principles or dogmas felt compelled to revise the Maimonidean list of dogmas. Some accepted Maimonides' approach and specific list, merely adding to it.12 Others rejected both Maimonides' specific enumeration of the principles and his claim that they were dogmas in the strict sense. Thus, for example, both Abba Mari (13th century)'3 and Hasdai Crescas (1340-1410)14 maintained that the principles of Judaism ought to be understood as axioms with the refutation of which the faith would collapse. That is not to say that they denied the salvific character of the principles (although Crescas, for one, certainly does not emphasize it); rather, they defined the principles differently than did Maimonides. Crescas' student, Joseph Albo (15th century) took his teacher's ideas one step further and sought to discover those beliefs which were axiomatic to true religion generally." R.

It is well known that he reduces the principles of Judaism to three: belief in God, belief in revelation, and belief in retribution. It is the contention of Julius Guttmann that in this he was, along with Albo, decisively influenced by Averroes: "Accordingly there is no doubt that the source of the three principles is Averroes. But Duran and Albo took from him, not only the principles themselves, but followed him in the complete train of his thought which brought him to distinguish between one who denies the principles of a religion and one who denies other beliefs."26 Guttmann summarizes Averroes' position, as applied to Judaism, in the following terms: 22 On Shalom's discussion of the principles of Judaism, see Herbert Davidson, The Philosophy of Abraham Shalom (Berkeley, 1964), p. 8, note 74. 23 On Muelhausen (14th-15th centuries) on the principles of Judaism, see Yehuda Kaufman (Even-Shmuel), R. Yom Tov Lippman Muelhausen (New York, 1927), pp. 34-35. 24 Elijah Delmedigo (1460-1493) discussed the dogmas of Judaism in his Behinat ha-Dat (published with a commentary by I. S.

ZEMAH DURAN: PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM 237 ... philosophic inquiry is permitted; the philosopher may interpret the Torah according to reason and, if he denies a belief found in the Torah because of a mistake in his inquiry, he does not thereby become a heretic. But none of this applies to the principles of the Torah. One who deviates from one of them denies the entire Torah. Guttmann goes on to say that Averroes' position does not differ from that of the Jewish philosophers from Saadia to Maimonides but only he expressed it in terms of a systematic teaching and Duran and Albo took that teaching from him.27 According to Averroes, as presented by Guttmann, there are three principles that every religionist must hold; this is true both for the philosopher and for the simple believer. Denial of any of these principles is heresy. These fundamental principles are belief in God, belief in prophecy, and belief in reward and punishment in the next world.28 Averroes distinguishes between two types of error concern- ing Scripture. The second type is Error which is not excused to any person whatever and which is unbelief if it concerns the principles of religion ... This latter error is that which occurs about matters, knowledge of which is provided by all the different methods of indication so that knowledge of the matter in question is in this way possible for everyone. Examples are acknowledgment of God, Blessed and Exalted, of the prophetic missions, and of happiness and misery in the next life; for these three principles are attainable by the three classes of indication, by which everyone without exception can come to assent to what he is obliged to know ...29 There can be little doubt that Albo was strongly influenced by this position of Averroes. He adopts the same principles as 27 Guttmann, p. 173. The text of Averroes with which Guttmann is dealing, Kitab faql al-maqdl, was translated by George F. Hourani as On the Harmony of Religion and Philosophy (New York, 1976). 28 Guttmann, p. 170. 29 Averroes (see above, note 27), p. 58.</page><page sequence="8">238 KELLNER [8] does Averroes,3 and, like the latter, frames his discussion in terms of the principles of religion in general.31 Further, again like Averroes, and, as we shall see, unlike Duran, Albo denies a place in the world to come to one who denies - whether knowingly or not - one of the basic principles of religion.32 The case of Duran, however, is not so simple. It would seem that Guttmann's claim for Duran's dependence upon Averroes in this context was made too hastily, perhaps on the basis of Albo's obvious dependence on Averroes, and his well-known dependence upon Duran. But to admit that Albo was influenced by both Averroes and Duran does not commit one to maintaining either that both Albo and Duran were influenced by Averroes or that Albo was influenced by Averroes through Duran. Albo had independent access to Averroes33 and careful examination shows that, despite some superficial similarities, Duran's position is actually very differ- ent from that of Averroes. It is also possible to trace some of Duran's ideas, at least, to sources other than Averroes. In what ways does Duran differ from Averroes (and from Albo)? First of all, he is interested, not in the principles of religion generally, but in the principles of Judaism specifically. Second, despite his talk of three "fundamental" principles, he actually maintains that Judaism has only one principle: to believe that everything the Torah says is true. Last, Duran, unlike Averroes and Albo, makes a sharp distinction between purposeful and accidental heresy. A summary and analysis of the texts presented below will demonstrate these differences. It must be noted at the outset that Duran couches his whole discussion in terms of a commentary upon and defense of Albo, Ikkarim, I. 4, p. 64. Albo, Ikkarim, I, Table of Contents, p. 2. 32 Albo, Ikkarim, I, 1, pp. 43-44 and I. 10, p. 98. " Albo cites him often.

ZEMAH DURAN: PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM 239 Maimonides.34 He does not see himself as presenting a new theory (as Albo, for example, certainly does) so much as explaining and defending Maimonides' choice of principles. This fact alone weakens the claim for Duran's dependence upon Averroes, whose doctrine is certainly at variance with that of Maimonides. Duran opens chapter eight of the Ohev Mishpat by stating that "it is one of the principles of the Torah to believe in this providence which the Book of Job seeks to verify." He notes that Maimonides included providence in his own list of "great principles," belief in which (according to Maimonides) is necessary for salvation. This provides Duran with the oppor- tunity to discuss Maimonides' principles and to defend them from the attacks of certain unnamed critics. Duran first questions why Maimonides left out certain beliefs (creation and free choice) and included others. The general question at issue here was Maimonides' criterion for selection: why did he include some principles and leave out others? Duran presents a general answer to this question in the following terms: What appears to be correct here is that Maimonides only included among the principles those which were taught by specific verses; these he made fundamental principles, even though they could be considered derivative princi- ples. (Those principles) which were not taught by explicit verses he made dependent upon the fundamental princi- ples, even though one who denies them is like one who denies the fundamental principles.35 In this passage Duran provides the criterion which guided Maimonides' choice of principles and on this basis defends him m To the best of my knowledge Eliezer Schweid is the only other student of Duran to have noted this important point. See his essay (cited above in note 3), p. 81. " The full text of Ohev Mishpat VIII and IX in English translation is given below. On that text, and on my translation of it, see below.

The text quoted here occurs on p. 13b of the editio princeps.</page><page sequence="10">240 KELLNER [10] against the charge of arbitrariness. It should be noted that, so far as I can determine, no other author followed Duran in explaining Maimonides' choice of principles in this fashion. The reason for this may be as follows. Duran understood the principles of Judaism as dogmas (beliefs which must be held in order to attain salvation); in this -he followed Maimonides. Since the Talmud does not unequivocally specify a binding set of dogmas, the logical place to look for such a list is in the Torah, which is exactly what Duran suggests that Maimonides did. Crescas and Albo introduced a new understanding of the principles of Judaism, one which more or less dominated all subsequent discussion of the issue. They saw the principles as axioms and axioms cannot be chosen according to the happenstance of verses. Duran's suggestion, which made excellent sense in the context of a dogmatic interpretation of the principles is little more than nonsensical in the context of an axiomatic interpretation of the principles. Duran goes on in this chapter to distinguish between what he calls fundamental and derivative principles: Were it not for the dependence upon the verses, the number (of principles) would be smaller or greater (than thirteen); for if we counted (only) the fundamental principles we would have only three principles, while if we counted the derivative principles there would be more than thirteen. However, the fundamental principles are three and no more [p. 14a]. Most scholars infer from this and similar passages3 that Duran is presenting a new doctrine of the principles of Judaism here. I think that this is incorrect for a number of reasons. For one thing, we have already seen that Duran's objective is to interpret Maimonides, not to disagree with him. Duran seems to be saying here (and says explicitly in other contexts, as will be seen below) that Maimonides' thirteen ' See, for example, Ohev Mishpat X, p. 15b and the introduction to Magen Avot, to be discussed below.</page><page sequence="11">[11] SHIMON B. ZEMAH DURAN: PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM 241 principles can actually be reduced to three. These three are fundamental precisely because all thirteen of Maimonides' principles can be derived from them. Secondly, and most importantly, despite his talk of three "fundamental" principles Duran does not distinguish between the fundamental and the derivative principles with respect to the most important issue so far as alleged Averroistic influence goes: their salvific character. One indication of this point is found in the way in which Duran relates his discussion of the principles to the laws of the Sabbath: ... this is similar to what the Sages did in listing the prohibited activities of the Sabbath. Those activities which, as was established by tradition, related to the (building of the) Tabernacle they established as fundamental categories - for only those activities relating to the (building of the) Tabernacle were forbidden on the Sabbath. They made those activities which did not relate to the (building of the) Tabernacle derivative categories even though they are punishable by stoning, just like the fundamental categories .. . Analogously, from the point of view of their denial, there is no difference between the fundamental and the derivative principles. It should be further noted in this regard that in his statement of the fundamental principles Duran includes all of those principles which he also labels derivative. Thus, for example, he writes, Belief in retribution and its necessary corollary beliefs are one principle which is that God knows the deeds of men and rewards and punishes them according to their deeds, either in this world or the next world, and either in the days of the Messiah or after the resurrection of the dead. Included in this principle are four principles: God's knowledge and retribution, the coming of the Messiah, and the resurrection of the dead [p. 14a]. This fact alone ought to warn us against taking Duran's 7 P. 14a. Emphasis added.</page><page sequence="12">242 KELLNER [12] division between fundamental and derivative principles too seriously and supports the contention that there is no differ- ence between them with respect to salvific significance. The point is further clarified when we turn to chapter nine. This chapter is given over to a defense of Maimonides against the charge that he denied the doctrine of creation. In the context of this discussion Duran takes the opportunity to state his own position on the question of faith and heresy: Know, Oye reader, that the great principle in all of this is that one ought to believe what the Torah teaches concerning these matters. He who denies something taught by the Torah, knowing that it is the opinion of the Torah, is a heretic and is not included in the community of Israel. On this basis it would be correct to say that the (number of the) principles of the Torah accords with the number of the letters of the Torah, or words, or verses, or accords with the number of commandments. For one who fails to admit to (even) one of them is an apostate and is not included in the community of Israel. It would also be correct to say that there is only one principle in the Torah: to believe that everything taught by the Torah is the truth ... [p. 14b]. Faithfulness or apostasy, therefore, do not depend upon which specific beliefs one accepts or rejects, but upon the reasons for one's acceptance or rejection of the beliefs. If one accepts an incorrect belief - even, I will show, concerning the so-called fundamental principles - thinking that it is the teaching of the Torah, one is not a heretic and is not excluded from the community of Israel. But the rejection of a single belief, knowing that it is a belief taught by the Torah, makes one a heretic and causes one to be excluded from the community of Israel. Duran discusses here the case of Elisha ben Abuyah, the notorious apostate Tanna. Elisha was a heretic because he rejected the Torah in toto. Duran does, however, cite a specific example of Elisha's heresy and it is of some importance for us here. He accuses Elisha of believing in "two powers," i.e., of</page><page sequence="13">[13] SHIMON B. ZEMAH DURAN: PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM 243 denying the principle of God's unity. The principle of God's unity, however, is intimately connected with the principle of God's incorporeality.38 Now, just a few sentences after his discussion of Elisha ben Abuyah, Duran quotes with approba- tion Rabad's criticism of Maimonides in which it is maintained that innocent belief in God's corporeality does not make one a heretic. But then, why is Rabad's simple if mistaken believer a good Jew and Elisha a heretic? The answer is clear: Rabad's simple Jew believes what he thinks the Torah teaches him to believe while Elisha rejected the Torah. Mistaken beliefs about any issue do not make one a heretic while conscious rejection of even the least of all the beliefs of the Torah does. It might be objected that I have not yet conclusively proven that Duran holds that mistaken beliefs about even the fundamental principles do not constitute heresy. I do not think that such proof is actually necessary given the way in which Duran consistently fudges the distinction between fundamental and derivative principles as already discussed. There are three specific instances, however, from which it can be seen that Duran indeed does maintain that mistaken beliefs about even the fundamental principles do not constitute heresy. One of these instances is relevant in the present context. It is the weakest of the three, since it depends upon accepting a reading found in the printed edition but not in what I took to be the best manuscript of the Ohev Mishpat.39 In one of his statements of the first fundamental principle Duran writes: ... there is only one principle (here): to believe that we have one God, living, powerful, willing, wise, eternal, etc., [that He is neither a body nor the power of a body, that He has no cause, that there is nothing like Him, etc.] and that we ought to worship Him alone [p. 14a]. Duran here makes incorporeality part of the fundamental 11 See, for example, Maimonides, "Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah," I. 7. 19 But since the passage is restated in Magen Avot with the questionable words, this problem is not serious. See below, notes 58 and 93.</page><page sequence="14">244 KELLNER [141 principle concerning God (if indeed the bracketed words are his). But we have just seen that he does not consider Rabad's simple believer in a corporeal God to be a heretic. Thus, mistaken beliefs about any issue, even the fundamental principles, do not make one a heretic. This is a far cry from the position of Averroes, which was supposed to have decisively influenced Duran's doctrine of the principles of Judaism. It ought to be pointed out further that while Duran repeatedly mentions the "roots" of the Torah in chapter nine, he never specifies what they are. Most readers, no doubt, assume that he is referring to the three fundamental principles discussed in chapter eight." I believe that this assumption is incorrect. If Duran had meant the three fundamental princi- ples, there is no reason why he would not have mentioned them. By "roots of the Torah" (a term suggested to Duran in the present context, I would imagine, not by its generally accepted use in discussions of Jewish dogmatics, but by the imagery associated with Elisha ben Abuyah, who "cut among the plantings") Duran means nothing more than acceptance of the Torah generally. But one ought not rely too heavily on Duran's terminology one way or the other, for, as Eliezer Schweid pointed out,41 Duran uses his terminology very loosely. Evidence of this fact, and further evidence supporting my thesis that Duran's three fundamental principles were not meant by their author to replace Maimonides' thirteen and were not posited under the influence of Averroes, is found in the passage with which the Ohev Mishpat opens. Duran writes: It is known that the foundations of the Torah and the pillars and pedestals most particularly necessary for its continued existence are two. The first is belief in creation and the second is belief in providence. Among (all) other beliefs these two are the most particularly necessary for ,o Not surprisingly, this is how Guttmann, p. 173, understands the term. 41 Schweid (see above, note 3), p. 81.</page><page sequence="15">[15] SHIMON B. ZEMAH DURAN: PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM 245 the continued existence of the Torah because the principle of the Torah is to believe that it is from heaven and to believe in the promises decreed for the fulfillment or negation of its commandments. All this is built on the foundation of the possibility of things not acting in ac- cordance with their natures. Were the world eternal a parte ante42 it would be impossible for things to deviate from their natures at all. If God did not extend providence to individual men all of the promises [of the Torah] would thereby collapse. If the world is not created and if God does not extend providence there can be no Torah at all. It is also known that (belief in) God's providence necessarily follows from belief in creation, for one of the consequences of belief in creation is belief in provi- dence, as will become clear to anyone who reads this, our book ...43 This passage is important in the present context for a number of reasons. In the first place we see Duran presenting here two, rather than three, fundamental principles. This fact alone should warn us against taking too seriously the three fundamental principles presented later in the book as a separate doctrine on the principles of Judaism meant to replace that of Maimonides. Here Duran counts belief in creation as one of the foundations of the Torah. Indeed, he shows how the other foundation, providence, can be derived from creation, in effect reducing the principles to one. Yet this one fundamental principle is not even mentioned among the fundamental principles of chapter eight. This, too, should warn us against seeing in chapter eight a new doctrine on the principles of Judaism. Reverting to our discussion of chapter nine we are now in a position to present the second item of concrete evidence which proves that Duran did not accept Averroes' doctrine concern- ing the principles of faith. He writes: 43 Ohev Mishpat, Introduction, p. 3b. For Duran's discussion of creation and providence, see Ohev Mishpat I, p. 7a.</page><page sequence="16">246 KELLNER [16] Were it proved by demonstration that the world was eternal a parte ante, we would interpret those verses which indicated that it was created in a non-literal fashion, just as we did with those verses which indicate (that God is) corporeal [p. 14a]. It would follow from this that if a scholar became convinced that the world was eternal a parte ante and reinterpreted the Torah along those lines (since, as Duran writes, "... the Torah does not force us to believe false opinions" [p. 15a]), remaining, however, a faithful Jew, he could not be accused of heresy, even though he denies the principle which Duran, in his introduction to Ohev Mishpat posits, in effect, as the single foundation of the Torah. The third case clearly substantiating my thesis is also found in chapter nine. In the context of his defense of Maimonides (and other scholars) who adopted opinions ordinarily thought to be heretical, Duran writes: There is also one of the Sages of Israel who said: "There will be no days of the Messiah for Israel for they have already enjoyed it in the days of Hezekiah." Even though the Sages condemned him for his dictum and revealed his error they did not say that he was a heretic even though one who believed this today would be a heretic according to what Maimonides firmly taught. The reason for this is as we stated above: since they accept the roots we ought not to exclude them from the community of Israel if they fail to believe in one branch of the roots because of their mistaken interpretation of Scripture [p. 15a]. Duran is clear and unequivocal here: R. Hillel, the author of the statement about the Messiah quoted in the above passage, was no heretic. But if we look at Duran's statement of the three fundamental principles in chapter eight we find belief in the coming of the Messiah to be, not a derivative principle, but actually part of the third fundamental principle: Belief in retribution and its necessary corollary beliefs are one principle which is that God knows the deeds of men and rewards and punishes them according to their deeds,</page><page sequence="17">[17] SHIMON B. ZEMAH DURAN: PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM 247 either in this world or in the next world, and either in the days of the Messiah or after the resurrection of the dead. Included in this principle are four principles: God's knowledge and [God's] retribution, the coming of the Messiah, and the resurrection of the dead [p. 14a]. Thus, despite his denial of part of the third fundamental principle, R. Hillel is not a heretic, because he accepted the roots of the Torah.44 It is thus evident that Duran's three fundamental principles were not presented as an independent theory meant to replace that of Maimonides and that he did not adopt them from Averroes. Duran presents his three principles as part and parcel of his explanation and defense of Maimonides. This fact becomes clear even in his Magen Avot, a work written long after the Ohev Mishpat, and a work whose very structure is determined by the three fundamental principles.45 We find the following passage at the end of Duran's introduction to Magen Avot: We have learned in the Mishnah: "All Israel have a portion in the world to come, for it is written, Thy people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified ... (Isaiah 60:21). But the following have no portion therein: He who maintains that resurrec- tion is not a Biblical doctrine, the Torah was not divinely revealed, and an apikoros."46 I now commence explaining it47 and tractate Avot, as I have set myself to do, with God's help." " This supports my contention that by the term "roots", found in chapter nine, Duran does not mean his three fundamental principles. 4' The Magen Avot was published in Livorno in 1785 (reproduced in Jerusalem, n.d.). The JNUL has microfilms of nine mss., complete and partial, of this text. I compared the printed text whith the microfilm copy of ms. 738/1 of the Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris (JNUL #11663) and found no significant differences in the passage translated here. Arieli's dissertation (see above, note 2) is largely based on the Magen Avot and analyzes it in detail. 46 Sanhedrin X. 1. 47 I.e., the Mishnah just cited. " As Duran notes below, it is customary to begin the study of Tractate Avot</page><page sequence="18">248 KELLNER [18] I have divided this book into four parts. I have called the first part Helek Eloha mi-Ma'al49; (in it) I refute the opinions of the apikorsim. I have divided it into five chapters: (1) God's existence, (2) His unity, (3) (His) incorporeality, (4) that He is eternal a parte ante - to this I added that He ought to be worshipped. These five principles," according to my opinion, are included (under the rubric) 'apikoros' mentioned in the Mishnah for he who denies them is an apikoros as I wrote in my book, Ohev Mishpat"5 - (5) concerning attributes. The second part relates to the statement, "the Torah was not divinely revealed." I called it Helek Shoseinu52 and have divided it into four chapters: (1) prophecy, (2) Mosaic prophecy, (3) revelation, (4) the eternity of the Torah. The third part relates to the one who says "that resurrection is not a Biblical doctrine." I called it Helek Ya'akov53 for Jacob our father did not die.54 I divided it into four chapters: (1) God's knowledge, (2) providence, reward and punishment, (3) the days of the Messiah, (4) resurrection of the dead. These are the three principles which earlier scholars55 summarized in the verse, And that the land be not desolate (Genesis 47:19)56: revelation, reward and punishment, God's existence." (These are) the foundations of the Torah for it is a foundation of the faith to believe in God, in His existence, unity, eternity a parte ante, by quoting from Mishnah Sanhedrin X. 1. That is why he opens his commentary on Avot with an analysis of that Mishnah. 49 Job 31:2: The portion of God from above ...

I do not know to whom Duran is referring. 56 The last word of the verse, OlT, is a notarikon (acronym) for the three Hebrew words, ,;11nl, 13V, (reward), and nmlK'1 (existence).

ZEMAH DURAN: PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM 249 incorporeality,58 and that He ought to be worshipped. This is included (under the rubric) 'apikoros' as mentioned above. After this (it is a foundation of the Torah) to believe in the prophecy of the prophets, in the prophecy of Moses, in the Torah, and in its eternity. This is included (under the rubric) "the Torah was divinely revealed." After this (it is a foundation of the Torah) to believe in reward and punishment and its branches. This is included (under the rubric) "resurrection." The fourth part is a commentary on tractate Avot; I have called it Helek Adonai Amo,59 they being the Sanhedrin and the Tannaim mentioned in it.6 Since it is customary to begin (it) with "All Israel have a portion in the world to come."61 It has the five chapters into which the tractate is divided. This section deals with the acquiring of ethical traits,62 they being the ladder with which to climb to the foundations of faith. I begin now with part one concerning the opinion of the apikoros, even though it is the last in Mishnah. I follow the order of the Torah which began the Decalogue with belief in God. After that I will explain Torah from Heaven. I will deal with resurrection at the end for it is the final reward.63 In this long passage Duran, far from introducing his three fundamental principles as a new theory of the dogmas of Judaism, introduces them as a commentary on the Mishnah in Sanhedrin6 and relates them explicitly to Maimonides' thirteen principles, all of which are mentioned here, and in the order in which Maimonides presented them. Further, he introduces this 58 Here Duran explicitly makes incorporeality part of the principle of belief in God and yet, despite this, as we noted above, he does not call the innocent, simple-minded believer in God's corporeality a heretic. 9 Deuteronomy 32:9: For the portion of the Lord is His people. 60 I.e., in Tractate Avot. 61 This is only a sentence fragment. It is not clear to me how Duran meant it to be related to the preceding and succeeding sentences. 62 1 WlI?. 63 Magen Avot, Introduction, p. 2b (bottom). 64 Duran relates Maimonides' principles to the Mishnah in Sanhedrin in Ohev Mishpat X as well.</page><page sequence="20">250 KELLNER [20] tripartite division, not as a new idea, but as one which was already discussed by earlier scholars. It ought to be noted further that by showing how Maimonides' thirteen principles may be linked to the Mishnah in Sanhedrin Duran, in effect, continues his exposition and defense of those principles. We may now see that, contrary to Guttmann's interpreta- tion, Duran was not trying to present a new list of the principles of Judaism, meant to replace the list of Maimonides, and that whatever the source of his opinions, it is not likely that it was Averroes. We further see that Duran, in his discussion in Ohev Mishpat, following Rabad, denies that mistaken beliefs constitute heresy. He is perfectly consistent in this position and extends it to all the principles of Judaism. The following considerations have led us to these conclu- sions. First, unlike Averroes and Albo, Duran is interested in the principles of Judaism and not in the principles of true religion generally. Second, unlike Averroes and Albo, Duran does not present his three fundamental principles as a new, independent, and systematic doctrine of the principles of Judaism. Rather, he presents them as a commentary upon and defense of Maimonides. He is also not consistent in his discussion, speaking in Ohev Mishpat in one place of three fundamental principles (God, Revelation, Providence), in another of two (Creation and Providence) and in yet a third place of one (Belief in the Torah generally). Third, unlike Averroes and Albo, Duran does not maintain that mistaken beliefs concerning even the fundamental principles constitute heresy. In sum, it may be stated that the Averroes-Albo thesis consists of two points: there are fundamental principles of religion and he who denies any of them is a heretic. Duran is ambiguous on the first point and denies the second one altogether. We may now take up a new question. If Averroes was not the source of Duran's ideas concerning the three fundamental principles of Judaism, what was his source? It is possible that</page><page sequence="21">[21] SHIMON B. ZEMAH DURAN: PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM 251 Duran came up with these ideas himself, especially in light of the fact that Maimonides' thirteen principles actually do fall rather naturally into the three groups into which Duran divided them. Indeed, once Duran made the suggestion, it was adopted by almost every other commentator on Maimonides' principles.6" I have found one other source which may indeed have suggested these ideas to Duran. Abba Mari of Lunel, in his Minhat Kenaot, not only reduces the principles of Judaism to three" but even refers to these three principles as avot ('fathers') just as does Duran.67 I have no evidence, however, showing that Duran knew of Abba Mari's position. We have now established the thesis proposed at the beginning of this essay: there is no evidence that Duran, unlike Albo, was influenced by Averroes in his doctrine of the principles of Judaism. His reduction of Maimonides' thirteen principles to three fundamental principles, his linking these three principles (and through them Maimonides' thirteen) to the Mishnah in Sanhedrin, and his thesis concerning the nature of heresy in Judaism are all independent contributions to Jewish dogmatics.68 It is now appropriate briefly to examine Duran's influence. It must be pointed out at the outset that while his influence on 65 See M.M. Kellner, "R. Isaac Abravanel on Maimonides' Principles of Faith," Tradition (in press) and Alexander Altmann's article cited above in note 3. " Jacob Guttmann (see above, note 2), p. 57n and Meyer Waxman (see above, note 3), p. 714, note 8, point out the closeness between Abba Mari and Duran on this issue. 67 See Abba Mari's Minhat Kenaot (Pressburg, 1838, New York, 1958), Introduction, chapter 4, p. 7. 68 Duran's approach is particularly noteworthy for what might be termed its relatively tolerant and liberal spirit. This becomes particularly evident when we compare his views on Maimonides and Gersonides, for example, with those of his elder contemporary and sometime colleague, Isaac bar Sheshet Perfet (1326-1408). Perfet condemned them fiercely for their alleged divergences from strict orthodoxy as he defined it. See Perfet's Responsa, no. 45; A.M. Hershman, Rabbi Isaac bar Sheshet Perfet and his Times (New York, 1953);</page><page sequence="22">252 KELLNER [22] subsequent Jewish thought was extensive to the extent that his ideas were popularized by Joseph Albo, his direct influence on other writers seems to have been very modest. For a variety of reasons Duran's philosophic works seem to have been very little studied, while Albo's Sefer ha-Ikkarim became very popular indeed. Duran's influence on Albo is well known and has been carefully documented.69 As noted above, his tripartite division of Maimonides' principles, and his linking of the three fundamental principles to the Mishnah in Sanhedrin is echoed in many subsquent writers. A number of his ideas are found in Isaac Abravanel's analysis of the principles of Judaism, Rosh Amanah.70 Abravanel, however, never cites Duran and there is no way of knowing whether or not he was familiar with the latter's writings. What may be considered Duran's most innovative contribu- tion, his analysis of heresy, did not strike a responsive chord in late medieval Jewish thought. Without mentioning Duran, both Abraham Bibago and Isaac Abravanel emphatically reject his ideas on this issue.71 Solomon Freehof, A Treasury of Responsa (Philadelphia, 1962), pp. 72-77; and M.M. Kellner, "Rabbi Isaac bar Sheshet Perfet's Responsum Concerning the Study of Greek Philosophy," Tradition, 15 (1975), pp. 110-118 and 15 (1976), p. 134. "6 See the essay by Jaulus, cited above in note 2. In the translation below I have noted the places where Albo borrows from Duran. Eliezer Schweid (see above, note 3), p. 81, points out that Duran apparently originated the idea of creating a "science" of the Torah. We find this idea in Albo at I. 17, pp. 145-7. 71 In Rosh Amanah XXII Abravanel reduces the principles of Judaism to creation as Duran does and in chapter XXIII, apparently echoing Duran, he writes: "... all the narratives, beliefs, opinions, and commandments in the Torah are, without exception, principles and foundations of it." 71 See Abraham Bibago, Derekh Emunah (Constantinople, 1522; repro- duced in Jerusalem, 1970), III. 5 (p. 102c) and Abravanel's Rosh Amanah XII. Abravanel borrows the passage from Bibago almost word for word. Ab- ravanel's position, and his use of Bibago, are analyzed extensively in the introduction to my forthcoming translation of the Rosh Amanah (London: Littman Library of Jewish Civilizaton, in press).</page><page sequence="23">[23] SHIMON B. ZEMAH DURAN: PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM 253 APPENDIX Duran's most important ideas on the principles of Judaism are found in three places: in the Introduction to Magen Avot, in the Introduction to Ohev Mishpat, and in chapters eight and nine of Ohev Mishpat. Translations of the first two texts may be found above, while I present a translation of the third text here. The Institute of Microfilmed Hebrew Manuscripts at the Jewish National and University Library in Jerusalem has microfilm copies of three manuscripts of the Ohev Mishpat. These are: (1) Bodleian 347 (Land. Or. 84), JNUL catalogue number 17266; the ms. was copied in 1485. (2) Bodleian 127, JNUL catalogue number 16191; the ms. dates from the 15th century. (3) Paris Heb. 240, JNUL catalogue number 27837; the ms. dates from the 15th-16th centuries. The first ms. has many mistakes, some caught and corrected by the scribe, some corrected in another hand, and some not corrected at all. The second ms. appears to have been much more carefully written, while the third is damaged and hard to read. In establishing the text for the present translation I have used the printed edition and the first two mss. I have generally followed the reading of the mss. (which largely agree with each other), except in the few instances where the reading of the printed edition clearly makes more sense. I have introduced words and phrases into the translation which were not found in the original but which were clearly demanded by the plain sense of the Hebrew. All additions which were not needed in this way but which I supplied to aid intelligibility were placed in parentheses. Overall, in the present translations (and in the translations presented above) I have tried to remain faithful both to the original text and to the English language. OHEV IISHPAT: Chapter VIII It is one of the principles72 of the Torah to believe in this providence which the Book of Job seeks to verify. Maimonides73 included it among74 the great principles, such as 72 P'1 31 . See above, note 7. 73 pit il? #1t. I translate this and all similar expressions simply as "Maimonides." 7" Literally' "compared it with."</page><page sequence="24">254 KELLNER [24] belief in God's existence and beliefs similar to it, which are such that there is no hope"7 for him who denies them. We ought to investigate here, following the development of the discussion, what Maimonides' intention was with respect to these principles, how their number was arrived at, and if their number forced him to divide them as he did.76 I have seen a short treatise by one of the educated men of our people77 in which he wrote that Maimonides wanted to follow the Torah which wrote that God had thirteen attributes,"78 this being their correct number according to what has become widely accepted among our people.79 Since this number forced him neither to add to nor to subtract (from his list of principles), he eliminated other principles which he ought to have counted, such as belief that the world was created. Similarly, concerning belief in God's existence, he eliminated some principles which we ought to believe. These are: that He is eternal a parte post," that He is true, that He is righteous, gracious, honest, living, intellect, knower and known; that He has neither accidents, form, nor matter; that His existence is nothing other than His essence; that He does not change; that He has neither genus, species, differentia, or definition; that He has no subject or opposite; that there is no other (being) with Him or like Him; that He has no cause; that He is not subject to division or composition, and many other principles like these. But Maimonides eliminated these because of the pressure of the number thirteen.81 He relied on the fact that all I.e., portion of the world to come. '7 We here see Duran introducing his discussion as a defense and explication of Maimonides. " The plausible inference, that this refers to ibn Bilia's Yesodot ha-Maskil ("Foundations of the Educated Man"), mentioned above in note 12, is incorrect. Ibn Bilia does not make this claim in his treatise. I do not know who Duran is talking about. 7, See Exodus 34:6. Jakob Guttmann (see above, note 2), p. 58n, points this out as the source for Albo, Ikkarim, I. 3, p. 60. 79 In a number of places in these two chapters Duran emphasizes the importance of a belief's having been generally accepted by the Jewish people. He does not appear to have the notion of consensus gentium in mind and I do not know why he does it. I' This is the criticism of the "educated man."</page><page sequence="25">[25] SHIMON B. ZEMAH DURAN: PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM 255 these would be (considered as) consequences82 of his principles. It would have been possible for him" to have shortened (his list) further by making God's existence, unity, incorporeality, eternity a parte ante," and that He alone ought to be worshipped - all five of them8s5 consequences of (God's) existence,'6 but the number thirteen pressured him. These are (the objections) as raised by that man." But his claim that Maimonides dropped belief in creation (from his list) because of the pressure of the number (thirteen) is not reason'able. Further, why did not Maimonides count among the princi- ples of the Torah that man is endowed with freedom and that there is nothing which forces one to act as one does, for, in truth, this is a great principle of the Torah? Maimonides cited it in the Sefer ha-Madda,ss in his Commentary on the Mishnah to tractate Avot,89 and in the Guide of the Perplexed."9 But the answer (to the questions) concerning creation of the world and choice (is as follows): it is clear and well known that belief in both of them is necessary for us because of their derivative principles.91 The derivative principle of creation is miracles and the derivative principle of choice is reward and punishment. Were it not for these derivative principles, which every adherent of the Torah must believe, then there would be 2 nrlThrn. I also translate this term as "derivative principles." 3 I.e., Maimonides. 84 ii?2rp. 85 I.e., Maimonides' first five principles. m Duran is rather casual here. He makes God's existence a consequence or derivative principle of itself if we read him literally. It is obvious already at this point in the discussion that Duran is not careful in distinguishing fundamental from derivative principles. 87 I.e., the "educated man." "Hilkhot Teshuvah," V. 1-5. See the eighth of Maimonides' "Eight Chapters". The text appears in I. Twersky (ed.), A Maimonides Reader (New York, 1972), on pp. 379-380.

I.e., the beliefs which are logically dependent upon them.</page><page sequence="26">256 KELLNER [26] no harm in believing in the eternity a parte ante of the world. The verses can be interpreted so as to render this un- problematic." There would also be no harm in believing that man is determined in his actions. But since it is only necessary to believe in these two principles because of the derivative principles, one ought not to count among the principles any except the derivative principles, by virtue of which we are forced to believe in the fundamental principles. By believing in the derivative principles we thereby believe in the fundamental principles. Maimonides, therefore, did not include in these principles belief in creation and belief in (human) choice, (having included) their derivative principles - the derivative principle of creation being resurrection of the dead, for one who believes in resurrection of the dead must [p. 14a] believe in the creation of the world, and the derivative principle of choice being reward and punishment, as was stated above. However, with respect to the principles relating to belief in God, which Maimonides presented as being five (in number) - no fewer and no more - there is room to investigate why Maimonides did this. For, had it been his intention to count only the fundamental principles and not the derivative princi- ples, then there is only one principle: to believe that we have one God, living, powerful, willing, wise, eternal, etc., [that He is neither a body nor the power of a body, that He has no cause, that there is nothing like Him, etc.,]93 and that we ought to worship Him alone. Maimonides did indeed include these in the Sefer ha-Madda and calls him who denies them a sectarian." Were it his intention to count each of the derivative principles separately (then) there are more than five and Maimonides should not have felt it necessary, by virtue of 92 Compare Guide of the Perplexed, II. 25, pp. 327-330. * The bracketed material is found in the printed edition but not in the mss. It is probably safe to assume that the words are Duran's however, since he includes incorporeality as part of the first principle in Magen Avot (see above, notes 39 and 58). That being the case, we here see Duran importing incorporeality into the first fundamental principle, even though he agrees with Rabad to the effect that one who, because of his simplicity, believes that God has a body, without thereby meaning to rebel, is no heretic. 9 1n.

ZEMAH DURAN: PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM 257 the number thirteen, to drop great principles, which are derived from faith.95 What appears to be correct here is that Maimonides only included among the principles those which were taught by explicit verses; these he made fundamental principles, even though they could be considered derivative principles. (Those principles) which were not taught by explicit verses he made dependent upon the fundamental principles, even though one who denies them is like one who denies the fundamental principles. This is similar to what the Sages did in listing the (prohibited) activities of the Sabbath.' Those activities which, as was established by tradition, related to the (building of the) Tabernacle they established as fundamental categories97 - for only those activities relating to the (building of the) Tabernacle were forbidden on the Sabbath. They made those activities which did not relate to the (building of the) Tabernacle derivative categories98 even though they are punishable by stoning, just like the fundamental categories. We have thus accurately expressed" Maimonides' opinion concerning this list (of principles).'00 It was not the case that the number pressured him in such a matter which is the essence of religion.101 We conclude that it was the dependence upon the verses which forced Maimonides; we do not conclude that he counted every principle subject to independent proof (separately), for he counted that God is neither a body nor the power of a body as one principle, even though each has an independent proof (relating to God's) existence and unity.'02 Were it not for the dependence upon the verses, the number (of principles) would be smaller or greater (than thirteen); for if we counted (only) the fundamental principles we would have only three principles, while if we counted the derivative 9 See Shabbat 49b. 97 Avot. 99 3PY. 100 Here again we see that Duran's intent is to defend and explain Maimonides. ,02 On these "independent proofs," see H.A.

However, the fundamental principles are three and no more. Belief in God and what follows (from that belief) is one principle. They'03 are: existence, unity, eternity a parte ante, incorporeality, and that one ought to worship God and no other. These five (derivative) principles, all follow from one fundamental princi- ple. Belief in the Torah and the necessary corollary beliefs constitute one principle, which is that God through the intermediation of the Separate Intellects causes a divine overflow"4 to extend to those who cleave to Him, so that they become prophets of various ranks. Included in this principle are four (derivative) principles: prophecy, Mosaic prophecy, revelation,105 and that the Torah will never be changed or altered, for divine activity is perfect, enduring, and eternal.

ZEMAH DURAN: PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM 259 mentioned but" we did not wish to state them here [p. 14b] for this is not really our subject; the development of the discussion brought us to discuss these things. Were it not for the dependence upon the verses Maimonides would not have counted (God's) unity and incorporeality as two (separate) principles, for incorporeality necessarily follows from unity, as anyone who has studied science (even) a little would know. But that which forced Maimonides to make the principles more than three, but not more than thirteen, was the dependence upon the verses, as we explained.110 This is what we wanted to explain (here). OHEV MISHPAT: Chapter IX In the preceding chapter we explained why Maimonides did not include creation of the world among the principles of the Torah. But one objection to what he said remains, for he wrote, The fourth principle is eternity a parte ante. One must believe that this aforementioned One is eternal a parte ante in the absolute sense of the term, and that every existent other than He is not eternal a parte ante when we compare it to Him."' The heart of whoever sees Maimonides' words here aches, for this kind of precedence"12 is accepted by those who deny creation of the world. They said that even though the world is uncreated"3 God precedes it by virtue of being its cause, even though He does not precede it temporally. Maimonides should have written, "Every existent other than He is not eternal a '09 Emending the text from 1LK to KN. 10 As noted above, this explanation makes sense only within the context of a dogmatic, as opposed to an axiomatic, interpretation of the principles. "' Duran's translation here is not that of ibn Tibbon, is not the one used by Abravanel in Rosh Amanah I, and is not that of Solomon ben Joseph ibn Jacob, edited by J. Holzer in Zur Geschichte der Dogmenlehre in der jiidischen Religionsphilosophie des Mittelalters: Mose Maimi~nis Einleitung zu Chelek (Berlin, 1901). In short, I do not know whose translation it is. There are no substantive differences among the three translations. 1121 rn11 P.</page><page sequence="30">260 KELLNER [30] parte ante at all." But that it114 is not eternal a parte ante when we compare it to Him is a belief which would be accepted by those who deny creation of the world and assert its eternity a parte ante. One ought not to suspect that Maimonides held this belief, for his thirteenth principle is resurrection of the dead"15 which necessitates (belief in) the creation of the world and in all of the miracles of the Torah and prophets. (Further), in the Guide of the Perplexed he made known his opinion that the world was created from absolute nothingness.1"6 Know, O ye reader, that the greatest principle in all of this is that one ought to believe what is included in the Torah concerning these matters. He who denies something included in the Torah, knowing that it is the opinion of the Torah, is a heretic and is not included in the community of Israel."'7 On this basis it would be correct to say that the (number of the) principles of the Torah accords with the number of letters of the Torah, or words, or verses, or accords with the number of commandments."18 For, one who fails to admit to (even) one of them is an apostate and is not included in the community of Israel. It would also be correct to say that there is only one principle in the Torah: to believe that everything included in the Torah is true. This is the point of the Talmudic dictum of R. Simlai, who said, "Six hundered thirteen commandments were given to Moses at Sinai ... Habakkuk came and reduced them all to one, as it is said, But the righteous shall live by his faith (Habakkuk 2:4).""119 By this he meant to say that from the aspect of their particularity they'20 were many, while from the aspect of their generality they are only one principle, it being the belief explained just above. You also ought to know that one who has properly accepted the roots of the Torah but was moved to deviate from them by the depths of his speculation and who thereby believed "' I.e., the world.

Therefore, even though he errs he is not a heretic and sectarian according to what is agreed upon by our people, since he accepted the roots of the Torah as he should. Will you not find among the Sages of Israel some who believed the opposite of what we agree is taught by our faith concerning the creation of the world? One said that an order of time preceded this one.'23 There was one who said that the Lord created worlds and destroyed them.'24 Maimonides quoted a dictum of R. Eliezer the Great from which it appears at first reading'25 (that he held) that the world [p. 15a] was created from something.'26 Heaven forfend that we say of them that they are excluded from the community of Israel because they were confused in their beliefs concerning creation! There was also one of the Sages of Israel who said, "There will be no days of the Messiah for Israel for they have already enjoyed them in the days of Hezekiah."127 Even though the Sages condemned him for his statement and revealed his error, they did not say that he was a heretic even though one who believed this today would be a heretic according to what Maimonides firmly taught. The reason for this is as we stated above: since they accept the roots'28 we ought not to exclude 121 As Jaulus (see above, note 2), p. 458, points out, we find a similar statement in Albo, I. 2, p. 49. Albo, however, unlike Duran, allowed for such error only in non-fundamental beliefs. 122 Here again we see Duran maintaining that intent to rebel is a crucial component in heresy. 123 Genesis Rabbah III. 7.

It was because of this that they said that he "cut among the plantings."'" But one who preserves the plantings according to their roots, and cuts among the branches of the stalk is, even though he errs, no heretic or sectarian. The discussion has now brought us to (the point where we can) rise to the defense of the scholars of our nation who adopted alien ideas which we are forbidden to believe. We are not permitted to denigrate them because of this and say that they belong to sects which reject the Shekhina, Heaven forfend - may there be none like that in Israel! - for they have perfect faith,'31 they are careful to avoid violating the (com- mandments of the) Torah and they strengthen themselves to observe the commandments properly. The Rabad'32 seized upon this (to criticize) Maimonides' statement to the effect that one who says that God has a body is a sectarian.133 He wrote: "(Even though) the essence of the belief is like this,"M if one believes that God has a body because he understood the words of the Midrashim literally, one ought not (therefore) to be called a sectarian.'""3 129 Duran expands this below to include philosophical mistakes. 'I Hagiga 14b. '~' Here again we see Duran's basic criterion of orthodoxy: the lack of any intention to rebel. 132 R. Abraham ben David of Posquieres. See above, note 16. 133 "4Hilkhot Teshuvah," III. 7. 1 4 I.e., that God is incorporeal. "35 This version of Rabad's gloss is considerably more polite than that found in the standard printed texts. Albo, I. 2, p. 53, quotes Duran's version almost word for word. Joseph Karo, in his commentary to "Hilkhot Teshuvah," III. 3, suggests that Albo's version (i.e., Duran's version) is the correct text. It is evident from the context that Duran is quoting Rabad approvingly. As Jaulus, p. 459, points out, the two preceding paragraphs find their echo in Albo, I. 2, pp. 52-53.</page><page sequence="33">[33] SHIMON B. ZEMAH DURAN: PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM 263 Do you not see that Maimonides, in one of the chapters of the Guide of the Perplexed, turned to an alien opinion concerning the opening of the ass' mouth36 even though the plain meaning of Scripture teaches the opposite of his opinion as does the plain meaning of rabbinic dicta (on this subject).137 Is it possible to say that through this belief he contradicted the principles of the Torah? Heaven forfend! Gersonides also, in one of the chapters of the Milhamot Adonai turned to an alien opinion concerning the creation of the world.'38 This, despite that he proved philosophically that it was created. We may not say, Heaven forfend, that he contradicted the principles of the Torah because of this divergence.139 The reason for this is that these perfect ones,140 and those from among our people who followed them, believed in the principles with perfect faith. It was their deep specula- tion, by which they sought to approximate things to the intelligible,141 and in which they opposed the multitude of scholars, which brought them to this divergence. If they err according to conventional belief they do not (thereby) con- tradict the principles of religion, just as the Sages of the Midrash did not contradict the principles of religion with these opinions which they held which opposed conventional belief. There is no difference between them except that the Sages of the Midrash turned to these opinions on the basis of their exegesis of the verses (of Scripture) while these scholars turned to them by the necessity of speculation. (In this speculation) they preserved the roots and forced their commentaries on the branches to accord with the roots. You ought further to know that the Torah does not force us to believe false opinions.142 For this reason we are permitted to 136 Guide, II. 42, p. 389.

We have seen that in this way the Torah and its miracles will be upheld for, according to the belief in the eternity a parte ante of the world, nothing at all can act except in accordance with its nature and the Torah as a whole would be abolished, since it is all of it (founded upon) supernatural miracles.148 You ought further to know that the necessity of believing in the creation of the world - in order to uphold the miracles of the Torah - does not relate to absolute creation, i.e., the belief that the world was created from absolute nothingess. For you will not find any of the miracles of the Torah or Prophets which involve creation ex nihilo.149 All of the miracles involve (creation of) something from something: a snake from a staff,150 manna from the air,'51 and likewise with them all.

For now you know that one is only called a heretic if he uproots the principles from their place. But one who believes in the principles and cuts among the branches because of the necessity of (his) speculation is, because he upholds the principles of the Torah, not a heretic, even though he errs. Thus, one who believes in the temporal precedence (to the world) of something other than God, but at the same time believes in the possibility of things departing from their natures, and (believes in) resurrection and things like it, even though he errs, and even though he ought to believe that nothing precedes the world, temporally or causally, but God, he is no heretic, for this belief did not bring him to pull up the roots, nor to deny what is included in the Torah, for his speculation compelled him to extend the meaning of the verses with respect to the branches while upholding the roots. This is what we wanted to establish. 5 Compare Maimonides, Guide, II. 25, pp. 328-329.</page></plain_text>
