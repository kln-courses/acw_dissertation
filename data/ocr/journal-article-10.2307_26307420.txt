<plain_text><page sequence="1">EROS AND INCANTATION: SAPPHO AND ORAL POETRY Charles Segal .Lor Sappho and her audience poetry is public communication. It is not fully separated from gesture, for it retains close associations with dance and with music. It is, in some sense, magic. It is also a neces sary and basic form of handing down and communicating knowledge about the gods, society, the nature of human life. Our growing awareness of the implications of oral composition and oral performance in early Greek poetry has opened new perspec tives on the archaic lyric. We shall try to extend these perspectives to Sappho, taking her most famous and most familiar poem, phainetai moi (fragment 31 LP), as our focal point.1 In so remote and so fragmentary a poet much must remain pure speculation. With this caveat in mind, we may still be able to gain some fresh insight into these scanty, but beautiful texts. "Longinus" quotes phainetai moi in order to illustrate the ef fect of conjoining the signs of intense passion. Given the formalistic bias and rhetorical approach of ancient literary criticism, Longinus' point of view is natural enough. Yet the rapid sequence of the symp toms which the poem lists point in quite another direction. It conveys a ritualizing, incantatory quality. This incantatory quality has a special relevance for early love poetry. Such poetry seeks to create a verbal equivalent to the magnetic, quasi-magical compulsion which the ancient poets called thelxis, "enchantment," or peitho, "persuasion." The repetitions and recur rent rhythms of the poetic language evoke the magical effect of eros itself; and this "magic" is also the mysterious peitho or thelxis which the archaic poetess undergoes when gripped by the beauty of a young girl. Eros, she says, "shakes" or "whirls" (donei) her con sciousness. He is like an elemental power of nature, a violent wind or an "overpowering creature" which "looses her limbs": 139 Arethusa Vol. 7 (1974) 2.</page><page sequence="2">140 Charles Segal "Ερος δ' έτιναξέ μοι φρε'νας, ώς άνεμος κατ όρος δρύσιν έμπετων. "Eros has shaken mv wits, like a wind from the mountain falling on oaks." (47 LP) "Ερος δηυτε μ'ό λυσιμε'λης δόνει, γλυκύττικρον άμάχανον δρΊτετου "Eros, looser of limbs, tosses me about, bittersweet, overmastering creature." (130 LP) We have to translate such verses into our own psychology and explain this anthropomorphic Eros as a force or a psychic power. But for Sappho the "power" of love is a god, as power often is for the ancient Greeks, and as such is to be summoned before her by the incantatory power and the quasi-magical thelxis of her poetry. Her poetry both portrays thelxis and, in a sense, is thelxis. The need to deal with complex emotions by projecting them into situations of personal confrontation or vivid exchanges of words and gestures may reflect not some innate flair for drama in Mediterranean peoples or the inadequate psychology of a supposedly primitive stage in the history of Greek thought, but rather the mental habit of a people whose cultural life — values, history, basic lore about nature and the arts - is encoded in an oral tradition and expressed and affirmed in contexts of oral recitation. In such a culture the act of using language to achieve a coherent picture of reality and to transmit it to future generations takes place in a situation of oral interchange. As Russo and Simon have suggested in a stimulating essay,2 the personi fied encounter between a god and mortal in Homer's scenes of decision or doubt may be a function of the mentality which shaped, and was shaped by, oral composition and performance. It is a question of a deeply rooted cast of mind, not of an inadequate psychological vo cabulary or deficient powers of abstraction, as the exponents of the genetic and evolutionary interpretation of Greek culture maintain. Sappho is fond of these situations of personal encounter. In a number of poems she calls forth the love-goddess, Aphrodite, and brings the divinity of love into the speaker's presence.3 Now this evocation of the goddess can be regarded as a form of thelxis: by</page><page sequence="3">Eros and Incantation: Sappho and Oral Poetry 141 this technique Sappho practices, in a highly sophisticated form, the magic of love. What more appropriate love-charm than to bring Aphrodite herself before you? The fact that some of these love-poems are themselves cast into ritual form invites speculation about their social function. A number of scholars have suggested as context some sort of thiasos, an as sociation of girls and women who felt themselves joined by a bond which they could celebrate religiously.4 "Religion" is a vague word, and one must be careful to distinguish between its functions in archaic and modern societies. One must be especially careful, in a discussion of archaic Lesbos, to banish any notions of Pre-Raphaelite spiritualism or mystical communion. In archaic Greece one venerates the gods at least as much for their elemental power as for their moral purity. The fragments on Eros cited above will serve as illustration. In the early sixth century B.C. the division between sacred and secular is likely to have been slight. Nearly all human activity has a sacred dimension, as the last part of Hesiod's Works and Days sug gests. The forms of association which united Sappho and her friends would naturally involve the veneration of a deity; and, on the evidence of the fragments. Anhrodite is the likeliest candidate, though we hear also of the Muses, the Graces, and once of Hera. This divinity pre sides over and solemnizes their shared activities. Needless to say, the presence of Aphrodite would not inhibit the physical expression of love among the members of this community. Early Greek society, like many holistic societies, seems to have dealt with erotic emotion and experience in far more public and stylized forms than modern industrial societies. Examples are the conventionalized banter exchanged by choruses in the epithalamia or the ritualized competition, centering often on the question of physical beauty, in Alcman's Partheneion. Some tantalizing lines of Alcaeus indicate that female beauty on Sappho's Lesbos played an important ιν/xc xii uuxt cuiu nau a lurwaiizeu, cigUlllSl/JLC StitLing v/\icaeus 1«3U.«3Z 37 LP).5 Not only did much of the choral poetry of early Greece have a ritual and sacral context, but epic too probably has its roots in ritual and incantation as well. We may draw here upon the work done on oral epic by Milman Parry and Albert Lord. Parry long ago observed (but did not explore) the affinity between formulaic repetition in Homer and</page><page sequence="4">142 Charles Segal ritual. Commenting on a recurrent formula in Homer, he remarked "how the use with it of other words which are always the same, and which always bring back the phrase with the same rhythm at the same place in the verse, act(s) strongly in making it habitual: Homer's formulaic diction is in this much like the charit of ritual."6 Lord developed this insight in greater detail: "It could be hypothesized," he suggests, that when myth became ceremonial, told in chant and verse, epic was born.'" In works like the Akkadian creation epic known as the Enuma Elish the ritual function of the poetry predomi nates, but it plays a role, albeit submerged, even in the secular forms of Homeric epic. Commenting on the alliterative effects of a passage in the Iliad, Lord remarks, "To us the effect is poetic magic, the magic of Homer's hexameters."8 Lord's expression is not just meta phorical, however, for he goes on to remind us of the similarities between the devices of oral narrative and the "practical magic" of charms and incantation: Yet the effect which results was surely calculated by the originators of this device, not for poetic, but for practical magic. This is a dynamic method of emphasis used by incantation and inherited by oral epic, if I am not mis taken, from far distant times. Magic spells throughout the world use alliteration and assonance to make the charm effective.9 The poets of early Greece, down through the fifth century, were keenly aware of and sensitive to the incantatory effects of ritualized sound. It could hardly be otherwise for men raised in an oral culture. The chant-like, sing-song pattern of such sound they called έπαοιδή. According to Homer and Pindar it could stanch blood and heal wounds ' - ' - ^ frx τ~\ · ι n ,j. Ο CI Α ΟΙ H\ n„nl„ \ua. IJ.tui-^uo, 1 111UCU, ι yi a close affinity between this έπαοιδή or "incantation" and the άοιδή of poetic song, between "la formule magique rhythmisée et la diction chantante."10 At the end of his eighth Nemean Pindar makes explicit the link between the "incantatory" magic of medicine and the "in cantatory" magic of poetry (Nem. 8.49-50), but the "therapeutic" effects of poetry are already familiar from Hesiod iTheog. 98-103). Homer had also recognized the connection between the magical "enchantment" of herbs and drugs and the magical "charm" or</page><page sequence="5">Eros and Incantation: Sappho and Oral Poetry 143 thelxis of love. Circe, enchantress of many drugs (Κίρκη ττολυψάρμακοζ, Od. 10.276), is also the poem's most successful and most dangerous practitioner of erotic seduction. Her thelxis is simultaneously magical and erotic: toÙç αύτη κατε'θελξεν, έπεί κακά φάρμακ' έδωκευ (Od. 10.213). "(Circe) charmed them herself, when she gave them baleful drugs." τεύξει τοι κυκεώ, βαλε'ει δ' έν φάρμακα σι'τω άλλ' ούδ' ώς Θε'λξαι σε δυνήσεται (Od. 10.290-291). one will lasnion a barley drink and cast drugs upon it, But not even so will she be able to charm you." The experience of love as a magical power has deep roots in Greek literature. Parallels extend from these pharmaka of Circe in the Odyssey to the pharmaka of Nessus in Sophocles' Trachiniae, from the Helen of Gorgias to the iynx of Simaetha in Theocritus' second Idyll.11 Sappho herself speaks of the beloved as "charming" or "enchanting" the mind (θέλγει νόον, 57 LP), and Alcaeus uses the same verb, speaking, apparently, about love-magic (B 13 LP). To create a linguistic equivalent to this magical "charm" or thelxis Sappho uses the divine epiphany of poems 1 and 2 LP or the simile of fragment 47 LP. The four preserved strophes of fragment 31 are bare of myth or simile, but their incantatory effect of sound and rhythm produces an analogous effect. Homer uses the verb θέλγει ν not only of the "charm" of love or desire (e.g. Od. 1.56-57, 3.264) but also of the charm of song or of involving, "spell-binding" narration. He so uses it twice of the Sirens (Od. 12.40, 44), where he mentions "song" explicitly in the second passage (12.44): άλλά τε Σειρήνες λιγυρή Θέλγουσιν άοιδή, "The Sirens charm with sweet song." The verb θέλγει ν also describes the fascination which Odysseus' lies exercise on his hearers (Od. 14.387, 17.514). Homer may well be applying to the effects of Odys seus' narratives his own experience of the oral poet's ability to "charm" or "enchant" his audience: the author of the Homeric Hymn to (Delian) Apollo uses the same verb, directly after άει'δειν, of the chorus' effect upon their audience:</page><page sequence="6">144 Charles Segal ΰμυον άει'δουσιν, θε'λγουσι δε φϋλ' άνθρώττων. "They sing a hymn and charm the tribes of men." (A. Apoll. 161) The idea of magical enchantment in all these passages must be taken quite literally. The formal, rhythmic and ritual effects of the song are felt to be capable of working real magic on the bodv and soul of the hearer, whether for healing or for pleasure. The common vocabulary suggests that the process seemed to the archaic poets akin to the effects of love or erotic fascination. In the "Deception of Zeus" in Iliad 14 the sexual "charms" (thelktêria) of Aphrodite's magical belt or kestos include not only love and desire (philotës, himeros), but also the "enchanting" power of language, the "cozening speech (parphasis) which deceives the mind of men, no matter how smart they are" (II. 14.216-217)!2 II Sappho, I suggest, draws upon this reciprocal relation between poetry and the physical reactions of the body: poetry as thelxis. The magical thelxis of her words seeks to create — or recreate - the magical thelxis of love. And she thinks and lives in a society where ritualized patterns are the essential means of achieving this thelxis. Ceremonial or ritual elements in the background of poetic composition (which, of course, are not necessarily conscious to the poet) need not imply the actual ceremonial function of such poetry. We are con cerned primarily with the former, but the division between the two may not have been very clear in archaic Lesbos. Ritual not only asserts the unity of the society or the group in the presence of the divine, but can also effect a personal transaction with divine powers. This private function of ritual is perhaps dominant in the ode to Aphrodite (fragment 1 LP), where Sappho has the goddess address her by name. In other poems, however, Sappho clearly depicts the public or communal setting, whether real or imagined, of rituals. The grove and altar of fragment 2 LP may have had a group of cele brants. Fragment 154 LP specifically mentions a number of girls</page><page sequence="7">Eros and Incantation: Sappho and Oral Poetry 145 standing "about an altar": "The moon shone full, and as they stood around the altar..(αί δ' ως περί βώμον έστάθησαν). Even in the Aphrodite ode (fragment 1 LP) the ritualized lan guage and situation of the hymnos kletikos may have served to relate Sappho's personal experiences to a social context. Her dexterity and wit in evoking the love-goddess and in creating a suitably graceful atmosphere for her epiphany themselves attest to her mastery of ιονβ s violence, ine rituaiizea structure 01 tne poem maKes tnis mastery available and aesthetically comprehensible to others. What ever its origins, the experience becomes a social act. It is embodied in language and song. Others can participate in it. Indeed, the mastery of love which the poem implies — whether actual or desiderated - becomes repeatable and accessible to the poetess herself on other occasions. Even in setting forth her personal, emotional life, Sappho is highly conscious of the language of public discourse and familiar formulaic situations. Between these and her own non-formulaic situa tion and personal discourse she creates subtle and sophisticated counterpoint. In fragment 16 LP, for example, not only is there a sharp antithesis, in the opening priamel, between "what some say" and Sappho's "I"; but there is also an elegant contrast between this "I" (fyco) and the wish to make her observations "understandable to all": of μεν πτττήων στρότον of δε πέσδων of δε νάων φαΓσ' έττί yccv μέλαιναν εμμεναι κάλλιατον, εγω δέ κήν' οτ τω τις εραται· πάγχυ δ ' εΰμαρες σόνετον ττόησαι πάντι tout' . .. (16.1-6). "Some say that the host of horsemen is the loveliest thing on the black earth, others of soldiers, others of ships, but I say that it is whatever anyone loves. And to make this understood to all is very easy."</page><page sequence="8">146 Charles Segal III With this framework in mind we may now turn to phainetai moi (31 LP). The first lines of fragment 31 set the stage for the power of eros. The adverbial ίμέροεν in line 5 sounds the first explicitly erotic note: the effect of the girl's voice and laughter is to awaken "desire," ίμερος. The strong verb έτττόαισεν in the next line (6) denotes the violence of this "desire." At this point the rhythmic-ritualizing effects become especially marked. ("Rhythm" as used here is a . i-1 L I ι i-1 * i.„ ι uiiv/i/ΐυιι iivi/ juol· wi uiiv^ iiiv/tvi , uuv v/i kiiu ιιιιλ^ι uvwiuii ui iiivtvi yviui sound-patterns, sentence-structure, and meaning). Sappho repeats ώς.. .σ(ε) .. .ως με in a single line (7). Then she introduces a rapid succession of short clauses, artfully varied through word order, chiasmus, and enjambment. The recurrence of the conjunction, δε, seven times in eight lines, contributes to the ritualizing, incantatory effect. The carefully built up patterns of alliteration and assonance reinforce these effects. Unfortunately the state of the text does not allow of equal certainty in all places. I shall confine my remarks to the third and fourth strophes, where these devices seem especially prominent: φαίνεται μοι κήνος ίσος θεοισιν εμμεν' ώνηρ, οττις ένάντιός τοι ι'σδανει και πλασιον άδυ φωνει σας υπακούει 5 και γελαι'σας ίμφοεν, τό μ' ή μ αν καρδι'αν έν στήθεσιν έπτόαισεν ώς γαρ ες σ' ίδω βρόχε' ώς με φώναι σ' οΰδ' εν ετ' εί'κει, αλλ' ακαν μεν γλώσσα t ε aye, λεπτον 10 δ' αυτικα χρώι πΰρ ΰπαδεδρόμηκεν, όππόττεσσι δ' οΰδ "εν όρημμ', έπιρρόμ βεισι δ' ακουαι, καδ δε μ' ΐδρως ψυχρός εχει, τρόμος δε παΓσαν αγρει, χλωρότερα δε ποιας 15 εμμι, τεθνάκην δ' όλι'γω πιδεύης φαινομ' εμ' αυτα άλλα παν τόλματον, έπεί Ί"και πένητα!

For when I look at you a moment, then I have no longer power to speak, But my tongue keeps silence, straightway a subtle flame has run beneath my flesh, with my eyes I see nothing, my ears are humming, A cold sweat covers me, and a trembling seizes me all over, I am paler than grass, I seem to be not far short of death ... But all can be endured, since ..." (Page's translation, modified) A strong alliteration of k and g in line 9 seems fairly probable (the emendations μ' έ'αγε and πέπαγε would both conduce to the same effect). It is strengthened by the k alliteration of αΰτικα χρώι in the next line. The d sound at the beginning of that line (10, 5') continues in the impressive drumming d's of ΰπαδεδρόμηκεν, which follows up the chiasmic pu / up pattern in πΟρ ΰπαδεδρόμηκεν. A similar, but more complex pattern recurs in the next line (11) in the or-m-/-rom- sequence of όρημμ ' έπιρρομ-. The drumming d beat of line 10 is taken up again in line 13, reading Page's emendation: καδ δε μ' ϊδρως ψυχρός έχει. Here, as also in line 10, the alliteration of fe-sounds accompanies the gPs. Vowel patterns also,reinforce the repetitive effect, especially the strongly marked sequence of open o-sounds in line 11 and the a sounds of line 14: παΓσαν αγρει, χλωρότερα δε ποιας. In all these verses the beat of the meter and the recurrent sound patterns work closely together to produce a rhythmico-ritual or ritual-mimetic equiva lent to love's "thelctic" power. Every verse beginning with line 7 contains at least one mn. junction: ώς, γάρ, ουδέ, άλλα, δε. This polysyndeton enhances the effect of accumulating intensity; but it also creates a rhythmical tempo of excitement and mounting tension analogous to the ritualizing effects of dance or drum beat. The one line that has no conjunction, namely line 16, follows directly after the climactic point of "death" (τεθνάκην, 15). Now the rhythm slows down, and the poem turns to what seems to have been a more contemplative, quieter mood: άλλα ττάν τόλματον έττεί... (17).13 Indeed, line 16 opens upon a new dimen</page><page sequence="10">148 Charles Segal sion of the experience presented in the poem, a shift away from external, physical actions to something internal and mental: φαι'νομ' εμ' αύται. The slowing down of the alliterative and repetitive tempo in 15-16 corresponds to the movement to another plane of experience. Now the closing cadence of the adonic, for the first time in the poem, marks a full stop in sense. Now too for the first time in ten lines a Catullus was aware of this incantatory effect of Sappho's poem; and he attempted to reproduce it, albeit in a more regular, self consciously formalized way, through alliteration and repeated sound patterns. His third stanza provides the clearest illustration (51.9-12): lingua sed torpet, tenuis sub artus flamma demanat, sonitu suopte tintinnant aures, gemina teguntur lumina nocte. Here we should note the complex pattern of t and s and is/us sounds in the first line; the m, a, n, u/o, and I patterns in the second line; the verb tintinnant, whose onomatopoeia imitates Sappho's ύπαδε δρόμηκευ as well as her έπιρρόμβεισι. Catullus has also exploited rhythmic and assonantal echoes between gemina and lumina in the last two lines and the sequence of t, g, and c in gemina feguniur / ... nocie. Sappho's patterns are subtler and less obvious. Closer to a situation of oral and musical performance, she could count on a finer perception of subtle effects. In the case of her poetry too, the recurrent beat of the musical accompaniment provided in itself a certain measure of incantatory regularity, thus permitting her greater freedom and variation in her sound patterns. The kind of rhythmical and repetitive pattern noted above is not uncommon in Sappho's verse, despite its fragmentary condition. The lUliesi paranei uceiirs 111 a pueui wiiuat; euiei suujeui ics me pcmiu ui eros, namely 1 LP. This poem in fact uses the ritual form of the hymn, albeit for personal and possibly humorous purposes. As Page observes, "This is not a cult-song, an appeal for epiphany recited with ritual ac companiment on a formal occasion in honour of Aphrodite: yet it is constructed in accordance with the principles of cult-song.'"4 Page sees humor in the triple recurrence of δηύτε in lines 15, 16, 18.15</page><page sequence="11">Eros and Incantation: Sappho and Oral Poetry 149 Yet this repetition is also a prelude (perhaps in a light vein and certainly on a purely private, mortal level) to the more solemn, more markedly ritual effect of the love-goddess' own words in the next strophe (21-24): και yàp af φεύγει, ταχέως διώξει, ai δέ δώρα μή δε'κετ', άλλα δώσει, αί δέ μή φι'λει, ταχέως φιλήσει κούκ έθε'λοισα. For if she runs away, soon will she pursue. If she receives not gifts, soon will she receive them, and if she does net lnvp snnn will she love even unwilling Aphrodite, appropriately, speaks in language which itself imitates the incantatory, hypnotic effect of love's thelxis. That effect depends on the repetition of the simple sentence structure ("If she flees, soon will she pursue; if she doesn't receive gifts, she will give them; if she doesn't love, soon will she love..."). The rhythmical echo between the first and third lines, ταχέως διώξει ... ταχέως φιλήσει, almost seems to assure the success of this spell-like promise.16 Other repetitions and alliterations contribute to this effect of incantation: the three-fold repetition of αί, the double repetition of δε' ... δε and of φι'λει ... φιλήσει; the analogous repetition (with an etymological play) of δώρα ... δώσει (22); the alliteration and rhyme of διώξει ... δώσει (at the end of two successive lines, 22-23); the strong d - alliteration in διώξει ... δε δώρα ... δε'κετ' ... δώσει ... δε'; the triple rhyme of -σει in the first three lines and the brilliant vari ation upon that in the assonance -λησει /-λοισα (φιλήσει ... έθε'λοισα) between the last two lines (23-24). Sappho then follows up this ritu aix^xiig xiixixxcoio υι uxc ixiagxu υχ ucoxxc yvxux eux atiuax xxiuax xuiiii, uic hymnic invocation to the goddess, ελθε μοι και νϋν (25). The cere monial effect of this latter phrase is especially prominent because it echoes, in a kind of ring-composition, the invocation at the beginning of the poem (5): άλλα τυι'δ1 ελθ(ε). As the enchantment takes effect, Aphrodite herself becomes gentler. The opening prayer, "Subdue me not with pain and anguish" (3) becomes at the end, "Release me from harsh cares" (25-26). The goddess' power to "conquer" (δάμνα), which is actually exemplified,</page><page sequence="12">150 Charles Segal later, in her promise to make the unwilling girl fall in love (21-24), now shows its benign side, "release," (λΰσον) (25). The goddess who inflicts the anguish 01 love can also remove it. These ceremonial effects of rhythm, repetition, and alliteration are more striking, naturally, in poems which are closer to public statement and to social situations. Hence one finds a noticeably high proportion of such effects in the Epithalamia. These poems, even apart from repetition and alliteration, have strongly ritualistic qualities, as a recent paper by Marcovich has emphasized.17 I list the following examples : "Εσπερε πάντα φέρων δσα φαίνολις έσκέδασ' αΰως f φέρεις διν, φε'ρεις αίγα, φέρεις f μάτερι παίδα _ (104a)18 "Evening star who brings all that the bright dawn scattered. You bring the sheep, you bring the goat, you bring the child to her mother." οίον τδ γλυκύμαλον έρεύθεται άκρω έπ ' υσδω, άκρον έπ' άκροτάτω, λελάθοντο δε μαλοδρόπηες ού μ αν έκλελάβοντ °, άλλ' ούκ έδύναντ' έπίκεσθαι (105a). "As the honey-apple reddens in the topmost bough, on the top of the topmost bough, and the apple-pickers have forgotten it, No, not forgotten it: they could not reach it." παρθένια, παρθενία, ποί με λίποισ' άποίχη; |ούκετι ήξω πρόξ σε, οώκε'-π ήξω f (114). "Maidenhood, Maidenhood, where have you gone and left me? I'll never come back to you, never come back to you." τιω σJ ώ φιλε /άμβρε κάλωζ έικάσδω; δρπακι βραδινω σε μάλιστ' έικάσδω (115). "To what shall I well compare you, bridegroom? To a slender sapling do I most compare you."</page><page sequence="13">Eros and Incantation: Sappho and Oral Poetry 151 Ιχοαροις ά νύμφα, f χαιρετώ 6' ό γάμβρος (117). "Hail to the bride, to the groom hail." Fragment 112 exhibits not only verbal repetition in consecutive lines (more marked if we read Fick's attractive ώς in the second line), but also a rapid accumulation of the groom's attractions listed in polysyndeton and with a run-on effect analogous to fragment 31 LP: οΛβιε γαμβρέ, σοι μεν δή γάμος ως αραο ε'κτετέλεστ ', έ'χτ^ς δε παρθένου f tiv ] αραο .. . σοι χάριευ μεν είδος, οππατα δ1 . . . με'λλιχ', έ'ρος δ ' έπ ° ίμε'ρτω κε'χυται προσώπω τετι'μακ'εξοχά σ° Άφροδίτα. (112): ι" "Happy groom, the marriage, as you prayed, is accomplished, You hold the girl whom (?) you prayed for ... Graceful your figure, sweet your eyes, eros is poured over your face. Aphrodite holds you in honor." One other fragment deserves citation in this connection, 140 a LP: καταθνάσκει, Κυθερη', αβρός "Αδωνις- τί κε θεΓμεν; καττυπτεσθε, κόραι, και κατερείκεσθε κίθωνας. (140a) 'Rino Δ ri γ»π ι ο pAT+liûrûQ rlioo Wli of οΚλπΜ ihû rln9" "Beat your breasts, maidens, your garments rend." This ritual lament for Adonis, the earliest known in European litera ture, utilizes a heavy alliteration of k and ί-sounds and the repetition of κατ- in compound verbs at three of the four main rhythmic pauses in the two lines.20 This poetry is meant to be recited or sung and certainly heard. It is therefore subject to the conditions of oral performance. Eric Havelock has called attention to the mimetic qualities of that per formance, the close rapport and interaction built up between poet and audience in the act of oral recitation or, as Havelock calls it, "the total act of poetic representation."21 Oral recitation of this type relies upon "the manipulation of verbal, musical and bodily rhythms"</page><page sequence="14">152 Charles Segal and exploits "a set of psychosomatic mechanisms ... for a very definite purpose."22 Havelock is speaking of the effect of the con tinuous recitation of oral poems of some length. Yet something analo gous may occur even in shorter poems. Here, of course, the poet has to concentrate and intensify rhythmical patterns which would ac cumulate more slowly and gradually in the expansive frame of epic. Correspondingly, the paideutic effect which Havelock thinks results from the audience participation in the recitation of oral epic would not be the same for lyric poetry such as Sappho's. Here, too, however, there may be something analogous. The effect of this poetry would be not so much to reinforce social norms as to lift the daimonic power of eros out of the realm of the formless and terrible, bring it into the light of form, make it visible to the individual poet and, by extension, to his or her society. Eros and its magical "charm" leave the darkness of the purely private, personal sphere. Its power can be recreated by human verbal means and thus raised to the level of public discourse, shared on a social occasion, in a community of friends or lovers, and, in the case of the epithalamian poetry, en listed in the service of the social institutions which make for con tinuity and stability (compare, for example, fragment 31 LP with 112 LP). Perhaps the desire to control and delimit the uncontrollable and the limitless lay at the origin of the impulses to write such poetry. Here again we need not necessarily exclude the private and ηιιΚίη/&gt;1ΐΐ7Λ nlnmnnf R\; ΰί7Γ\1/Ί η et fVio rtaci Γ»α11ιησ un its mpmnrips (a.Q in fragments 94 and 96 LP), making present the deities and myths of love and recreating its magical force through incantatory patterns of sound and sense, Sappho creates a pharmakon, a "drug" or "charm," to cure the sufferings of love. Already in Hesiod song can allay pain, and in Theocritus poetry is the surest pharmakon for love's agony (Idyll 11.1-3). In the case of Sappho, however, we cannot be sure where to draw the line between the personal and the conventional.23 It is not necessarily the unique, but the recurrent and universal features of her experience of love which Sappho seeks to present. The formalized patterns of her language may, in fact, have served to link her own emotional life to situations of frequent and repeated occurrence in the culture or sub-culture to which she belonged. As Merkelbach and</page><page sequence="15">Eros and Incantation: Sappho and Oral Poetry 153 others have suggested, Sappho returns repeatedly to the experience of love and loss not only in order to grasp the nature of her own emotions, but to focus and clarify intensely involving situations which the girls and women of her society would undergo again and again.24 The roots of Sappho's poetry, in other words, may lie not just in the intensity of her own erotic experiences (and I see no reason to deny their reality), but also in her capacity to intuit, to live imaginatively, and to re create poetically the emotional experiences which were of greatest concern to the circle to which she belonged. The formalized language of love, then, not only expresses private emotionality, but constitutes a means of generalizing erotic experience and translating the personal and private into a visible and communicable form. Considered in this perspective, the epiphany of Aphrodite in fragment I would not stand so very far, mutatis mutandis, from her appearance to Helen in Iliad 3 or from the epiphany of Athena to Achilles in Iliad 1 or to Odysseus in Odyssey 13. In an oral culture, as we have suggested earlier, formalized and ritualized patterns are the natural medium for an exchange of this sort. They cast the private and idiosyncratic into the mold of the universal and the generic. Hence Sappho's reliance upon a fairly stable and well-defined "vocabulary" of erotic motifs and symbols: the wish to die, memory, roses, garlands, perfumes and unguents, the sheltered grove, the moon. What can be dramatically enacted in situations of confrontation can also be shared: it is assimilable to the society's basic form of cultural transmission. In Sappho's own words, one's personal preference for "what one loves" becomes "intelligible to all" (frag. 16). We need not conceive of Sappho as a group-therapist or assume that the therapeutic function of her work played a conscious role in what notion she may have had of her "Dichterberuf. " The fragments speak of commemoration and oblivion, not of help or advice.25 But vtiv/iv/ χυ ν &gt; mv/iivv uiiwugn iiuill U1C Xi agilICHÎO IU JJlUlUcXLt! LIlclL lilt! desire to understand the emotions of love in herself and in others was, consciously or not, a major aim of her poetry. We may compare, for example, the brief fragment cited by the Stoic Chrysippus, "I know not what to do. Double are my thoughts" (noëmmata, frag. 51 LP). In recreating the brilliance surrounding the great lovers of heroic myth - Helen and Paris, Hector and Andromache, Leda, Adonis,</page><page sequence="16">154 Charles Segal Endymion, Medea26 — Sappho found another way to grasp the essence of love. The need to relive her and others' erotic experiences and to set them against these paradigms from the mythical past may be inextricably intertwined with the desire to shape patterns of beautiful sounds. In both cases she calls up the reality of eros as vividly as she can. In a fictional or at least aesthetically distanced situation she can more freely and more reflectively contemplate that god's dark and dangerous domain. The result, as in the case of Homeric epic, is a conquest of daimonic violence, an absorption of what is chaotic and threatening into the radiant forms of art, an extension of speech, of the logos, over the unspeakable. The powers of magic and incantation, the thelxis of eros, obeying the measured rhythms of the world of art, lose their raw, sawage power. In a poem like 1 LP the incantatory element is already a latent metaphor, several stages removed from primitive magic. The process provides evident relief and release. The elemental force of eros is not in itself diminished, but it now occupies a place in a human world where it loses the edge of its terror. What Havelock says of the paideutic effect of oral epic poetry can, mutatis mutandis, be aDolied to the effects of oral lyric : In performance the co-operation of a whole series of motor reflexes throughout the entire body was enlisted to make memorisation and future recall and repetition more effective. These reflexes in turn provided an emo tional release for the unconscious layers of personality which could then take over and supply to the conscious mind a great deal of relief from tension and anxiety, fear and the like. This last constituted the hypnotic pleasure of the performance... Pleasure in the final analysis was exploited as the instrument of cultural continuity." (emphasis added). The personal lyric, of course, does not "exploit" the pleasure of emotional release for the same ends. It sufficed to produce a unique aesthetically and emotionally pleasurable experience, for which the archaic sensitivity to and enjoyment of the ritualistic patterns of</page><page sequence="17">Eros and Incantation: Sappho and Oral Poetry 155 word, sound, and rhythm singularly prepared the poet's audience. Havelock calls attention to early Greek culture's ... automatic relish in life and its naturalistic acceptance of life's varied and manifold moral aspects. The Greeks, we feel, were both controlled in their experience and yet also unfettered and free to an extent that we cannot share. They seem to enjoy themselves. They seem to take natural pleasure in fine shape and sound which we too sometimes recognize as beautiful but only after we have first pulled ourselves up by our own boot straps to an educated level of perception.28 (emphasis added). Sappho's artistry lies in her power not only to create and utilize such rhythmico-ritualizing effects, but also to move between this public, social form of utterance and quieter, more relaxed, more private moments. The former is rooted in concrete, physical observa tion and in the mutual participation between poet and hearer in the rapid, tense rhythmical and repetitive tempo; the latter deals in less tangible experiences and the more inward terms of "seeming," imagin ing, dreaming. Here the staccato rhythm loosens, as in line 16 of fragment 31: φσι'νομ' εμ' αύται. One should hardly assume, however, that at such moments the poet has forgotten her audience or is lost to the world in a self-centered revery. Rather, she has merely shifted to another plane of discourse and another mode of communication. The total aesthetic experience produced by such a work as 31 LP results from a coming together of the two levels of communication, the ritual and the private. It is just here, at these points of juncture between the social, outward-facing, public dimension and techniques of her art and their private, more personal, less ritualistic aspect, that Sappho especially exemplifies her originality and artistry. It is also where she is most difficult for the modern sensibility to grasp. The very existence of an interplay between one level of style which is close to ritual and public discourse and another which is freer and more private introduces an essential difference between oral epic and oral lyric in the archaic age. This difference, in turn,</page><page sequence="18">156 Charles Segal is analogous to the differences between Homeric and Hesiodic poetry. Hesiod's intrusion of his self-conscious "I" and, like Sappho, of his own name29 accompanies a nascent critical attitude. He feels a certain distance, be it ever so slight, from total absorption in the "truth" of his art.30 With this distance there comes a complexity which goes beyond and shatters the unity, continuity, and impersonal ity of the narrative surface in epic. Oral epic holds the audience's total involvement and forbids looking away from this absorbing world to the actuality of the poet, as person, standing before his audience. The poet of oral epic be comes transparent to his tradition and his technique. With that trans parency he holds his hearers spell-bound, literally, to the unbroken flow of his "honey-sweet voice."31 Hence the disturbing effect of Penelope or Odysseus' weeping at Phemius and Demodocus' songs (Od. 1.335 ff, 8.83 ff and 521 ff): it breaks the all-absorbing spell of the epic world with the intrusion of present reality and present grief. The poet of oral lyric or of oral didactic poetry or even of oral hymnic poetry (cf. h. Apoll. 169-173) does not lay claim to this degree of impersonality. Hence he can afford to break the continuity of his narrative surface with more than one type of discourse. Yet the techniques of these latter poets can depend also, at least in part, on the poet-audience relationship of the oral performance; and, as in the case of the ritualistic elements in Sappho's love-poetry, they draw heavily upon at least one aspect of that relationship - the thelxis created by rhythmed beat and sound — for their major effects. It follows from this line of approach that we need neither accept the notion of a definitive break in mentality between Homeric epic and lyric poetry advocated by Snell and his followers32 nor deny the lyric poets their radical innovation in search of new forms of personal expression. As a number of recent works have suggested, the situation is more complicated than Snell allowed.33 The lyric poets did not simply abandon the mentality and the techniques of oral poetry or merely rework the old epic formulas to fit the needs of their pressing drive for personal expression. The new expressiveness of personal emotion interacts with the older public forms and finds its realization both through and against the conventions and the poet audience relationship of oral recitation. The balance shifts even</page><page sequence="19">Eros and Incantation: Sappho and Oral Poetry 157 within a single poem. But the habits of the oral tradition, as one would expect, remain deeply ingrained. They reveal themselves ex ternally in the deliberate echoing ol epic phraseology and epic situa tions;34 but they are reflected, at a deeper level, in the poet's reliance upon the auditory, mimetic reflexes created in oral performance, where insistent rhythm still evokes age-old incantation, where pat terned sound, tempo, and ceremonial gesture can still work their magic.

The reply to Page by Merkelbach (above, note 4) 6-12 = Antike Lyrik, ed. W. Eisenhut, "Ars Interpretandi," 2 (Darmstadt 1970) 82-89 presents perhaps the most acceptable view of the marriage-song interpretation, i.e. that the ritual context allowed Sappho to express an intensity of emotion which normal discourse and the normal modes of relation in society would render diffi cult. On the other hand we know too little of what conventions on archaic Lesbos would or would not have permitted. 20 Frag. 168 may also contain a scrap of an Adonis song, and one should add the Linus-lament of frag. 140b. On possible cult associations see Bowra (above, note 17) 211-214. Even in poems of an apparently more personal, less public nature the effect of rhythmic repetition can "imitate" what I have called the "thelctic" power of eros. We may observe the effect of the anapaests and the diaereses in fragment 47 LP (cited page 140). Even more striking is the interaction of the lilting ionic rhythms with the sound patterns in fragment 102 LP: γλυκηα μδτερ, ούτοι δύναμαι κρε'κην τον ϊστον ττόθω δόμησα παίδος βραδι'ναν δι" Άφροδιταν.
