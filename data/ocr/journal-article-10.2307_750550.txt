Vat. lat. 6435.-1 A closer study of the codex after the appearance of that report convinced him that a full edition of the text, or a detailed interpretation and commentary like the one which he had given for an earlier discovered manuscript of the same author, the Cod. Pal. lat. 1993,2 would not be justifiable considering the amount of research work and the cost of publication in- volved. It was seen that the provisional report on the Vaticanus, though very brief, had caught a good deal of the essential addi- tions to what was presented in the older study of the Palatinus. Opicinus appeared not to have changed much in the one year between the work on his two manuscripts. In some ways the picture had become a little deeper; some more detail of his personal story, his case history and his character had come out, but not enough to justify a new book on the man already studied so intensively. Opicinus was verbose and repetitive and not everything he brought to paper deserves perpetuation in print; the numerous drawings in the new manuscript are rather monotonous variations of themes already treated extensively in the Palatinus. It is for this reason that the provisional notice is now followed by no more than an aftermath which will deal with some subjects of perhaps some special interest picked out of the huge mass of new text and pictures.3 I The Tarasque The Tarasque is a well-known figure in Provenqal folklore: a mythological monster which lived in the Rh6ne river and ate men and beasts. It still appears today, as it has done for centuries, in the ritual of popular festivities at Tarascon, the Rh6ne city popu- larized by Alphonse Daudet's Tartarin. Up to the end of the eighteenth century the "course" of the Tarasque, in which a huge effigy of the monster was carried through the streets of the city with traditional pranks, was an annual event on Whit-Monday. Through the nineteenth century it was much in abey- ance and was celebrated only sporadically, in 1846, 1861, 1891, and then again in 1946. Since then the "Fftes de la Tarasque" have been brought back to annual celebration under the auspices of the local "Syndicat d'Initiative", as an attraction for the tourist trade. They are now held on several days of the last week in June, the "course" of the Tarasque now being integrated into a grand corso of floats and music bands.4 All through the year the effigy (P1. 26a), a large construction of wood, metal and fabric, about twenty feet in length and six in height,5 is on exhibit daily in the offices of the Syndicat. It is a nineteenth-century replica of older Tarasques worn out in former festivities. The intricate problem of the origin and meaning of this folk tradition is not within the scope of this notice. It has been discussed thoroughly in M. Louis Dumont's admirable recent monograph6 which deals with the subject from ethnographic, historical, literary and iconographic viewpoints. The literary history of the Tarasque begins with its appearance in hagiography. The legend of St. Martha, ascribed to (Pseudo-) Marcella or Marcilia, a servant of the "Saints of Provence"-Lazarus, Maria Magdalene, Martha and Maximin-and now positively dated to about I2OO, 7 tells how the saint, the patron of Tarascon, liberated the city from the monster. By sprinkling it with holy water she tamed it, bound it with her own belt and delivered it to the people to be killed.

Her day (July 29) or the following Sunday is often celebrated with a procession which displays a smaller effigy of the monster, the "Petite Tarasque", led by a young girl representing the saint.8 Outside Tarascon and Provence the legend has been popularized through Vincent of Beauvais's Speculum9 and, probably more so, through the Golden Legend,10 in both of which the Ps.-Marcella text reappears with slight alterations only. Like numerous other saints St. Martha appears in art represented with a dragon as one of her standing attri- butes. Whichever form St. Martha's dragon may have received at the hands of the artists, the literary evidence proves that originally he is the Tarasque of the Tarascon legend. The iconography of the Tarasque, either individually or in connection with the Saint, is rich for recent centuries, less so for the Middle Ages."1 The type which appears fully developed in paintings, woodcuts and prints of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries12 corresponds rather closely to the effigy used today, as well as to the description of the monster in the text of the Ps.-Marcella legend: "draco ingens, medius animal terrestre, medius piscis . . . et erat grossior bove, longior equo, os et caput habens leoninum, dentes ut spata acutos, comas equinas, dorsum acutum ut dolabrum, squamas hirsutas ut taravos scindentes, senos pedes et ungues ursinas, caudam vipeream, binis parmis ut tortua utraque parte munitus." M. Dumont has traced the existence of an effigy, and implicitly a rite for which it was used, back to 1465. Beyond that date the available iconographic material is either un- clear in one or the other way or insufficiently dated. Some seals of the city of Tarascon, of 1211, 1217 and I249,13 present the Tarasque in a form which still is rather remote from the later type. Some coins of King Ren6 (1434-8o)14 show the monster more similar to what became the standard form, but they are too small to give more than a superficial impression. Besides there are some old monuments which present not the monster in isolation but illustrate the scene described in the legend in which the saint overcomes the Tarasque: "[On the request of the despairing people St. Martha comes to help] reperitque draconem in nemore, hominem quem iugulaverat comedentem. Et iacta super eum aqua sacrata quam secum tulerat et signo ligneo sancte crucis ei ostenso draco stetit victus ut ovis, et beata proprio cingulo eum alligavit, et illico a populo lanceis et lapidibus attritus est totus." These older monuments, dating from ap- proximately the thirteenth to the fourteenth century, already show, more or less com- pletely, the elements of the standardized type of which there are numerous samples from the later centuries up to the present time: a six-footed monster devouring a man or a child whose legs protrude from its snout; the saint carrying a cross or an aspergill, or both, holding the monster with her belt. A very old sample, the oldest in existence according to M. Dumont's opinion, perhaps from the thirteenth century, on a stone boulder (stile) near the road from Tarascon to Maillane, is in so poor a state of conservation as not to allow an analysis in detail.15 Another one, also of uncertain but undoubtedly great age, B A photograph of this procession (of 90oo) is in the Spanish Enciclopadia Universal Illustrada, LIX, 1928, p. 585. The "Petite Tarasque", about 7 ft. long and 4 ft. high (see Dumont, pl. IV and pp. 39-41) dates from about 19oo only. Older samples (1795) are mentioned by Dumont, p. 133. SX, 92; 94; 99-o101; o104-07; Dumont, loc. cit. 10 C. o105 (xoo); Dumont, loc. cit. A younger version of the Tarasque story in a Vita S. Mariae Magdalenae et S. Marthae wrongly ascribed to Hrabanus Maurus (Migne, P.L. 112, Col. 1431-1508; Bibl. hag. lat. II, 8xo, no. 17) differs considerably from these older texts, dissolving the very specific description of the monster into the clich6s of the popular or fairy-tale dragon figure. Reprinted Dumont, pp. 166-67. Germaine Maillet, Ste. Marthe, Paris, 1932, has traced the legend into the missals of Provence, Toulouse, Cologne, Prague and into the dramatic works of Lope da Vega and his contemporary Luis Velez de Guevara. xx Dumont, pp. 179-94, gives a survey of all known presentations (sculptures, seals, coins, woodcuts, etc.) of local (Tarascon) or regional (Provengal) origin. This is supplemented by the list of St. Martha pictures in S. Gagnibre, Catalogue de l'imagerie populaire religieuse avignonaise, Avignon, 1943, nos. 382-92, 402, 451, and by some more data in Germaine Maillet, op. cit. 12s Gagnibre, loc. cit.; Dumont, pls. V, VI, XVII, XVIII, XX. 13 Dumont, pl. XXII. The monster appears here, in contrast to the later type, with a very long neck that makes it similar to the basilisk of the bestiaries.

De- stroyed during the French Revolution, it is conserved only in an unreliable nineteenth- century copy of an older copy.16 A third archaic sample, unfortunately also of quite uncertain age, is a leaden group of saint and monster, perhaps a pilgrim's badge.17 Chrono- logically one reaches firmer ground with the capital of a column in the cloisters of St. Trophime at Arles, safely dated to the middle of the fourteenth century.18 The scene pre- sented here, however, is different from that of the other samples: it is not the taming of the monster by the saint; it is the end of the story: the monster has already given in as indicated by the downward turn of its knotted tail. The saint has withdrawn to the back- ground, and in the front a man with a hatchet is about to strike the death blow.19 This being the iconographic situation up to the end of the fourteenth century,20 the dis- covery of a new sample might be welcome, the more so since it has the advantage of being precisely dated. Opicinus de Canistris in his day book (Cod. Vat. lat. 6435) shows the amount of fami- liarity with legendary material which one would expect from the average clergyman of his time. Quotations from the Golden Legend or similar sources appear frequently in his text. Residing in Avignon since 1331 he made Shimself familiar with the legendary tradition of Provence, including the Ps.-Marcella ver- sion of the legend of St. Martha. The Tarasque appears in his notes about a dozen times, either simply mentioned or used for his peculiar play with names21 or for the purposes of his permanent hunting for alle- gorical messages of doom or calamity.22 More valuable than these quotations is a design of the Tarasque which Opicinus has entered on the lower margin of Cod. Vat. 6435, fol. 52v (P1. 26b). The note in the lower left-hand corner of this design gives the exact date on which it was made: Friday, September 19, 1337. What this picture repre- sents is exactly the scene which appears stereotyped in popular art of the eighteenth century:23 the saint, with a veil over her head, holding a cross and the belt with which she has already caught the Tarasque. The monster itself, six-footed, with a knotted tail, the head of a beast of prey and a big shock of hair, the legs of the victim protruding from its mouth, is surprisingly similar to the popular pictures from the eighteenth to the twentieth century24 and even to the effigy in use at the present day.25 In his concluding remarks on the icono- graphy M. Dumont states that the monu- ments known to him could give the impression that "le type s'est fix6 tard",26 that the form in which the Tarasque has been presented since the eighteenth century is of compara- tively late origin. But the existence of the detailed description of the monster in the legend causes him to reject this conclusion. It is a pleasure to present here a docu- mentary proof for the great age of the "type". In all essentials this Tarasque of 1337 looks like the effigy of the twentieth century. The design also proves the early existence and the remarkable persistency of the formula, the presentation of saint and monster together, connected by the belt, which is basically, in spite of certain changes in the arrangement of the group, the same in this fourteenth- century design as in the pictures of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. An incidental note which Opicinus entered into his day book some weeks after having drawn the picture indicates the source of it. 16 Dumont, pl. XIII, top; critical description, ibid., p. x8x f.

Jahrhunderts, III, Leipzig, 1927, p. 157, no. x6x8. 20 The very rich later iconography needs no con- sideration here: it might, however, be mentioned that finally in recent times the Tarasque has "made the grade" by being included in a Martha mosaic by L. O. Merson in the cupola of the Sacr6 Coeur in Paris.

Vat. 6435, fol. 67v): "Precedentibus annis vidi super maius altare sancte Marthe illam memorialem imaginem Tarascini, qua inde remota... semel submissa voce primo diluculo missam celebravi in festo sancte Marthe in eodem altari." So there was an altar-piece of St. Martha and the Tarasque somewhere27 in Avignon which for unknown reasons was removed some time between 133 i-the year in which Opicinus took his residence in Avignon-and 1337. It is not possible to say how far Opicinus's design, evidently made from memory, reproduces the detail of this lost altar-piece, of which there are no other traces anywhere, but it stands to reason that at least in a general way it served as his model. This would allow the conclusion that the tradi- tional "type" of the Tarasque existed already before Opicinus's time and, being repre- sented in an altar-piece, must have been well known in Avignon. One more feature of the design deserves consideration: the Magdalene figure on the left side. Martha and Magdalene appear often enough together in group pictures of the Saints of Bethany,28 but in the local and regional (Tarascon and Provence) icono- graphy29 of the Tarasque scene from the thirteenth to the nineteenth century Magda- lene appears only once more together with her sister: in a lithograph by Jean Baptiste Magny of Avignon, made in the second half of the I82o's3O (P1. 26c). The two sisters are here represented as the patrons of the gar- deners-hence the unexpected horticultural decor on the lower margin of the lithograph. The Tarasque, half covered by the figure of St. Martha, looks more like a heraldic attri- bute than a participant in a dramatic scene. She has lost much of her murderous fierce- ness. The traditional legs of the victim are replaced by a protruding pointed tongue. It does not seem that a connecting line of tradi- tion should be sought for between Opicinus's drawing and this modern lithograph. Opici- nus, as usual, gave in to his urge for symmetry and concordia oppositorum when he added the Magdalene figure to that of her sister, al- though according to legend and tradition Magdalena has nothing to do with the Tarasque story. The lithographer, on the other hand, simply put two conventional figures of saints side by side on one plate be- cause they belonged together for his cus- tomers, the gardeners. The inscriptions on Opicinus's design are of no great significance. In one of them the Tarasque is explained as a symbol of hypoc- risy;31 the unhappy human being devoured by the monster is Christianity: "devoratur si- militudine margarite"-an allusion, it seems, to the story of Cleopatra's pearl. The two saints are characterized in con- formity with tradition as active and contem- plative life, the congregatio laborantium con- fronted to the religio speculantium. The notice immediately under the figure of the Tarasque: "Potentialiter non est alius draco terribilis nisi ille qui scripsit hec qui frendet ut leo et insidiabitur sicut draco" is one of the numerous attempts of Opicinus to find his personal destiny symbolized, always in a pessimistic sense, in some figure of entirely different original meaning.32 Apart from this group the Tarasque ap- pears twice in Opicinus's designs. The picture on fol. 61 of the Cod. Vat. 6435 (P1. 26d) shows the monster on a small scale; even here the protruding legs are visible.33 An earlier sketch appears in Opicinus's picture collection of 1336 (Cod. Pal. lat. 1993, fol. 8v; see P1. 27b). Like the preceding one 27 I must leave it to the local historians of Avignon to find the location of this altar since I have no access to the special literature. The formula "maius altare sancte Marthe" sounds as if it meant the main altar of a St. Martha's church, but I find no church of this name in Mollat's list of parishes in Avignon (Les Papes d'Avignon, 9th ed., Paris, 1949, P. 443). Another possi- bility is the existence of a St. Martha's altar in the Cathedral or one of the parish churches; but why then "maius"? Opicinus's relations to Tarascon were not close enough to assume that he means the St. Martha's church of that place. 28 For instance in Lucas Moser's altar-piece of 1431 at Tiefenbronn, to which Professor Erwin Panofsky directed my attention, and in Correggio's group of St. Peter, St. Martha, St. Magdalene and St. Leonard (Reinach, Repertoire I, p. 528; Ricci, Correggio, Berlin, 1897, pl. facing p.

I owe the reproduction of this rare item to the kindness of M. Sylvain Gagniere. 81 Here: "ypocrisis infernalis". In the text on the same page Opicinus says, more specifically: "Magna testudo draconis vel Tarascinus devorat hominem, idest hypocrisis clericalis destruit populum Christianum." 32 See Salomon, Opicinus de Canistris, I A, pp. 41 f. and 218. 33 The serpent-like monster on the African side of the map, connected by a line with the Tarasque, belongs to quite a different field and is not to be discussed here.</page><page sequence="6">b-Opicinus de Canistris, head of the Tarasque.

The variability of Opicinus's allegorical in- terpretation is characterized by the fact that here the interpretation is optimistic: "devoratio omnis carnalis affectionis per veram contritionem sui peccati." Outside Tarascon the Tarasque appears in ritual use of the fraternity of the "h6tes et patissiers" at Avignon, which has St. Martha as its patron saint,35 and also in the Corpus Christi procession in Madrid, and elsewhere in Spain. She has even entered into the Spanish language in which the word "tarasca" is used for an ill-natured woman.36 II City Maps and Topography of Pavia In my preliminary report I indicated that some of the maps in Cod. Vat. lat. 6435 (P1. 27a) might have some value for the local history of Pavia. A closer study has led to some results which I am offering here. I have had to restrict myself to presenting the material; further analysis must be left to the local historians. The literature can be fully expounded only in Pavia where recourse to the still existing remains from Opicinus's age is possible at any time for any special problem. In this section the two Opicinus manu- scripts, Pal. lat. 1993 and Vat. lat. 6435, are referred to only as Palatinus and Vaticanus, or Pal. and Vat. De laudibus refers to Maiocchi's and Quintavalle's edition of Opicinus's Liber de laudibus civitatis Ticinensis in the new Muratori t. XI, p. I (Citti di Castello, 1903). The De laudibus contains a wealth of topo- graphical information which has given the book a prominent position among the sources of local history of Pavia. The work proves the author's remarkable talent for geographical and topographical observation, and his pains- taking love of detail.37 Acquainted as we now are with Opicinus's achievements in drawing in the Palatinus and the Vaticanus, we might regret that he has not bothered to illustrate his description of Pavia with pictures. A drawing of the Cathe- dral which he included in the Palatinus is the only picture of Pavese architecture which we have from his hand.38 He has however tried his hand at drawing the plan of the city in both the Palatinus and the Vaticanus. City maps appear here and there in older literature.39 A well-known example is the colossal marble plan of Rome from the third century A.D.; a recent discovery goes even much farther back: a plan of Nippur to be dated about I500 B.C.40 From Opicinus's own century there are a few samples in existence: e.g. a map of Jerusalem by Petrus Vesconte41 (1320), one of Rome from about the same time;42 but neither of them is a 3 There is a small-scale reproduction of the whole plate in Salomon, op. cit., I B, pl. XXXIV. In the commentary, I A, p. 191, n. 6, I did not recognize the Tarasque and characterized the figure wrongly as a "fishlike monster", although on p. 275 I gave the correct identification of the "tortuosus coluber over- come by St. Martha". 35 Dumont, p. 45. A "Burgus de Tharasca"-per- haps the name of a house with a relief presenting the Tarasque, cf. Dumont, pl.

A Rue Tarasque and a Rue petite Tarasque still exist in the south-east of the city, near the Porte Limbert; cf. Pansier, ibid., XI, 1911, p. 404. 36 A substantial illustrated article on the Madrid Tarasques is in Enciclopidia Universal Illustrada, LIX, 1928, p. 585. See also Diccionario de la Lengua Castellana, R. Acc. Esp., 1914, s.v. 37200 years before Opicinus's time the Archipoeta, the author of the "Aestuans intrinsecus" which con- tains the often quoted stanzas about the loose morals of Pavia, had also written in a poem in honour of Frederick Barbarossa: "Primo suo domino paruit Papia: Urbs bona, flos urbium, clara, potens, pia, Digna fores laudibus et topographia Nisi quod nunc utimur brevitatis via." (Archipoeta, ed. Manitius, p. 46) The stanza reads like a prophecy of Opicinus's book. "Laudes et topographia" are its contents indeed. 38 Reproduced Salomon, IA, pl.

They are "ichnographic" maps in the older style: showing the elevations of individual prominent buildings from an arbitrarily chosen point of observation, they give only a vague indication of the layout of the area. Recently Professor Heydenreich has dis.. cussed the history of the city plan again.43 He defines the turn from the ichnographic map to the modern one as the replacement of the "natural visual processes" by the mental construction of a bird's-eye view-in other words, the adoption of a system which had already been used in the Portolano maps since about 1300oo. He credits Leone Battista Alberti with the "development of a mathe- matical planning system by introducing lati- tude and longitude demarcations, thus mak- ing it possible to determine the exact position of everything within the boundaries"; but already on the Portolani the so-called rhumb- lines or loxodromic lines had given the same possibilities for a more or less precise location of individual places. For the city plan Opicinus has used such a system over a hundred years before Alberti. This system, although it remained buried in his manuscripts which nobody ever consulted, is interesting enough to deserve some con- sideration. In the introduction of the De laudibus Opicinus states that the inner district of Pavia, the area within the first city wall, covers an area of eighty and more iugera of equal size, each of which has the same square form.44 It is the network of these squares which he used as the basis for his city maps. On the last page of the Palatinus (fol. 27v) there is an unfinished sketch45 showing the eighty squares, surrounded by a triple frame of slightly irregular lines. A comparison with any good historical map of Pavia46 proves these lines to be a fairly precise design of the three old city walls.47 The only trace of script on the plate are the names of five Pavese churches, entered in Opicinus's hand in the top squares on the left which corre- sponds to the north-west corner of the city. Of these five, two are still in existence; they appear on the sketch as nearly as possible on such a small scale in their actual topographi- cal position-a first proof of the practicability of the iugera system. In a larger scale the same network appears in Pal. fol. I2.48 Here only the names of two churches are entered, again in the correct topographical position: the Cathedral and Opicinus's own parish church, S. Maria Capella. A red line indicates the limits of the parish.49 Finally, in the centre of Pal. fol. 27, the triple ring of the walls reappears on a very small scale, too small to allow reproduction of the iugera net, but cartographically cor- rect. 50 In the last pages of the Vaticanus Opicinus returned to his endeavours for a city map, this time with more detail. Vat. fols. 84, 84v and 85 each contain such a sketch, again based on the iugera system. They are similar to each other; P1. 27a, reproducing fol. 84v, will be enough to give an idea of the character of all three of these designs.51 Unfortunately Opicinus has subjected the city plan here to the same treatment which he gave to so many of his maps: the superimposition of a second map over the first.52 The resulting coincidences of names in the two layers allow him all kinds of fantastic conclusions which he elaborates in his extensive marginal notes. The system is of course arbitrary and purely subjective, a kind of cartographical game of solitaire with no conclusive results for anyone but the player himself;53 the pettiche di Roma, Rome, I879, is derived from the Marcianus. Reproductions of both the maps are in Holtzmann's article. ,8 L. Heydenreich, Leonardo da Vinci, New York, 1954, I, p. 86 f. ,- De laudibus, p. 4. ,5 Salomon, IB, pl. XXXVII, Abb. 52; IA, p. 292, n.

The presentation is furthermore complicated by the addition of anthropomorphic and partly obscene figures as in many of Opicinus's maps.54 Here we shall ignore these upper layers entirely and concentrate on the factual data of the lower ones. Fig. I tries to consolidate the contents of all the city plans from the Palatinus and the Vaticanus. A comparison of this con- solidated map with the text of De laudibus will show at once that Opicinus brought only a small part of his topographical knowledge to cartographic representation; but what he brings is correct in positions and proportions. It is regrettable that this gifted map designer did not choose to complete his sketches. He could have made something as rich and in- formative as that which Ottavio Ballada pre- sented in his map of Pavia three hundred years later, a work which has retained its value for research in local history and topo- graphy to this day. Since Fig. I shows the entries only in very small script which might be difficult to read, it seems practical to repeat them here. Each one of them can easily be identified with the help of Maiocchi's and Quintavalle's index in De laudibus. A.

Many more samples in Vaticanus. 55 Opicinus mentions this church which is no longer in existence and already missing in Ballada's map of I654, several times in the text of the Vat. It was the parish in which his family lived and in which he grew up. 56 De laudibus, p. 19, enumerates the four "foundation stones" of the city: "civitas... super quatuor preciosos et magnos lapides est fundata, qui sculpti sunt ymagi- nibus quatuor cardinalium virtutum": Fortitudo in the south-east of the city, at a gate ("Porta lustina" in Ballada's map) in the inner wall; lusticia in the west at the middle gate of the same wall (= Porta Marenca); Temperantia at the southern gate which leads to the old bridge; Prudentia "in medio basilice estivalis cathedralis ecclesie magis versus sinistram partem, idest aqui- lonarem, quasi in corde templi". In Vat., fol. 74v, ?i, Opicinus mentions the Prudentia again: "Ymago Pru- dentie in corde basilice estivalis in septemtrione instar lugentis significat . . ." So there was, or at least he saw, an expression of mourning in the face of the figure. All four stones are entered in capitals suo loco in the map; see below. 5 In Vat. fol. 85 (left margin), Opicinus mentions the church as "S. Michaelis vulgariter Michelini". 58 Opicinus's own parish, 1323-28; often mentioned in both Pal. and Vat. The limits of the parish are indicated by the pyramid-like line on the map, Pal. fol. 12 (Salomon, Is, pl. XXXIV, Abb. 39), and Vat. fols. 84, 84v and 85; omitted by mistake in P1. 27a. 59 Indicating the residence of a family of this name which is mentioned several times in the Vat. 60 The names of these two gates are shifted from their correct place to the lower margin of the page, outside the square system. A line connects each of them with the place where they should be. Both are men- tioned also in Vat., fol. 79v (margin note, bottom right); the Porta Pertusi also fol. 85 (left margin, up). 61 The third of the "foundation stones", see above, n. 56. The history of this monument, in later cen- turies appearing under the popular name of "I1 muto dell'accia al collo" is complicated and I am not in possession of the full material. For first information see G. Capsoni, Notizie risguardanti la cittd di Pavia raccolte da un suo cittadino, Pavia, 1876, pp. 154-57. According to Capsoni the earliest known mention appears in a document of 1535, the earliest description in Breventano's Istoria dell'antichita della cittd di Pavia, 1570, fol. I5. The peculiar name is explained (Robo- lini, Notizie, I, i6) as a misinterpretation of the fold (the sinus) of the toga which the statue wears, "accia" or "azza" being a Lombard dialect word for "skein"- "the mute man with the skein around his neck". The following statement from Vat., fol. 35v, is not only over 200 years older than the testimonials from the i6th century but shows the identity of the alleged "Iustitia" and the "Muto": "Intestina involuta [human entrails] cum fuerint eviscerata, sunt similia filis disvolutis que apud nos vulgariter vocantur acie fili ex lino vel lana [lane MS.].

Beside the maps the text of the Vaticanus gives some detail on the topography of Pavia. There are a few street names: the vicus qui dicitur Pomum Absconditum and the vicus qui dicitur Mons Ioci69 without indication of their location; the vicus Monete,70 evidently in the region of the present Via della Zecca between Piazza Grande (Piazza Vittoria) and Strada Nuova; the vicus qui dicitur Forus Magnus sive Roma Vetus in the eastern part of the city;7' and in the "cauda vel angulus civitatis", meaning the south-eastern end of the city, the vicus dictus Stercorarium idest vulgariter Remerdariolum, in which the church of St. Mark the Evangelist is situated.7 2 The sewers of the city are mentioned several times,73 the famous towers of Pavia, however, only once, as symbols of the sin of Superbia.74 More topographical detail appears in un- expected places: a note on the technical problem of movable feasts brings the casual remark that of the two churches in Pavia dedicated to St. James one (S. Jacobus in Vernabula) is allotted by common usage to Jacobus Alphei, the other (in Foro Magno sive Roma Vetere) to Jacobus Zebedaei.75 A long ethical dissertation ends with the re- mark: "sapientia dei pervertitur in terrenam prudentiam quasi aureum celum in plum- beum tectum",76 a formula characteristic of Opicinus's enigmatic style, and under- standable only as a reminiscence of the church of S. Pietro in Ciel d'Oro in Pavia, the place of St. Augustine's grave, which according to De laudibus had a leaden roof.77 III Some Topographical Notes on Avignon When Opicinus arrived in Avignon in 1329, the city had been the papal residence 62 Perhaps a Pavese historian can find an explana- tion for this puzzling formula, which might-and might not-be unique. "Ingenium" could mean a.o. a machine for war (Du Cange s.v.); but when speaking of such a machine Opicinus uses the word machina (De laud., p. 22). There is perhaps the possibility of a misread or misinterpreted ancient inscription. Not in order to offer a solution, but only in order not to suppress any material which perhaps could help, I give here a chance find: in Cod. 336 of the Municipal Library of Avignon-a handbook written for use in the papal Penitentiaria by a contemporary and colleague of Opicinus (see Catal. gdn&amp;r. des mss., Ddpartements, XXVII = Avignon vol. I, 1894, pp. 247-49)-fol. 97, I found the following: "Gloria Grecorum - invidia Romanorum - ingenium Lombardorum - ferocitas Francorum - stultitia Xsaxonium [sic] - ebrietas Slavorum - luxuria Saracenorum - duritia Judeorum - ingluvies Theutonicorum." Could there be a connection between this curious piece of ethnology and the enigmatic "domus ingenii Papiensis"? 63 One of two monasteries situated near to each other; either S. Martino or S. Maria alle Caccie. 64 "in suburbiis", De laud., pp. 12, 13. 65 Both these names in Vat., fol. 84v, further out west than indicated in P1. 27a. 66 According to Maiocchi and Quintavalle, p. 26, n. i, there is, or was, some controversy about the loca- tion of this place. The entry in Vat., fol. 84v, might be valuable. 67 The larger one of the two is the old (perhaps Roman) bridge, half-covered. It was replaced in the middle of the 14th century by the famous covered bridge which was rebuilt after the Second World War. The smaller bridge, farther east, is the "Pons Novus", a wooden construction which does not exist any more. See De laud., p. 21, n. 3-4. 68 Literature listed in De laud., p. 18, n. 2. Opicinus mentions the Cadrona also in Vat., fol. 36v-37, in a wild and partly very disgusting topographical and geographical capriccio, which is much too long to be printed here and would take pages and pages of com- mentary for interpretation. There he compares the two arms of the Cadrona to Euphrates, Tigris and Jordan "qui omnes decurrunt ad austrum". The local historian might find it necessary to consider the whole long paragraph. He will be well advised if he takes the map, fol. 84v (both the map of Pavia and the super- imposed map of Europe) as a help for understanding the dark text. 69 Both in Vat., fol. 72v, ? 1. 70 Vat., fol. 84 top. 71 Near the present Palazzo Mezzabarba; see P.

The Cathedral already stood, crowning the Rocher des Doms, dominating the landscape and not yet disfigured by the statue of the Virgin on its spire. At the foot of the knoll, below the Cathedral, there was the old Palace of the Bishops of Avignon which served as papal residence under John XXII. It was only during the years which Opicinus spent in Avignon that it was replaced, step by step, by Benedict XII's austere monastery fortress78 and the Gothic structure of Clement VI which now together form the palace, the impressive pile which a younger contemporary of Opicinus called "la plus belle et la plus forte maison du monde".79 The area of the city was not even half of what it is now, enclosed by the walls built after Opicinus's time in the 1350's and recon- structed beyond recognition by Viollet-le-Duc in the 186o's. A narrower ring of walls, now entirely vanished but traceable on any map of the modern city, enclosed the central part south of the palace. Within this ring there was a crowded town, over-crowded indeed by the immigration of the personnel of the curia and more so by the steady stream of visitors coming on business from all parts of Europe. Information about the layout of the city in the fourteenth century is scanty.80s A few topographical data can be culled from Opicinus's occasional remarks on Avignon. There, as in Pavia, he kept his eyes open for topographical detail. Unfortunately he did not include a map of the city in his manu- script, although it is evident from his notes8x that he had such a map or a sketch for it among his papers, decorated and complicated by a superimposed map of the world just like his maps of Pavia. Here, just as there, he is fascinated by the empty play with coinci- dences between the two layers of maps. Of individual buildings Opicinus mentions St. Anthony's Church in the southern section of the city;82 the Dominican monastery in its western part;83 the papal alms office (Paniota, Panhota, Pignotte);84 and quite often his own residence, a "hospitium" in which he occupied one room from August 1331. He describes this hospitium as situated in the southern part of the city between the livre'es of four cardinals: namely that of Giovanni Orsini in the south; that of Luca Fieschi in the north; that of Matteo Orsini in the west; and that of Napoleone Orsini in the east.85 He also gives the position of the hospitium as between the church of St. Didier in the west and the Franciscan monas- tery of St. Claire in the east.86 A little touch of colour is provided by the notice that the hospitium is surrounded by wine dep6ts, so that one day in the time of the wine harvest he found his exit blocked by wine casks.87 Of street names I have found only one: the major Fustaria.88 IV Family Names from Pavia Here and there in the Vaticanus, especially on fols. 67 and 67v, Opicinus mentions Pavese families, sometimes under their real names, sometimes with masks in the style in which he already treated his own name in the Palatinus.89 In view of the great amount of work which Pavese historians have done for genealogical and personal history90 the result of a study of these entries is not rewarding. The following families ("progenies") trace- able in the printed literature appear in the Vaticanus either in their original form or in easily recognizable variations: Beccaria, Buti- gella, Cani, della Croce, Figari,91 Fornari,92 78 In Vat., f. 74, ? 7, Opicinus describes an accident which he happened to witness: "On October 20, I337, I stepped out of the Consistorium inferius [a room in the old palace of John XXII]. While we were standing at the door, a scaffold broke down in front of the new palace which was under construction. Wood and stones and workmen fell, and some were killed." 79Froissart (ed.

There are only a few names that I have not been able to trace elsewhere: a "progenies Cloacarum seu vul- gariter Clavicarum",95 the "Contriti"96 and the "progenies Salomonis",97 each of which might be either a real name or a mask. For his own family, the Canistri, Opicinus plays the masking game with special gusto: they appear as "canis tribus", "calathi", "cophini panis".98 There are also a lady "orta de progenie equitum bovis", a member of the Cavalcabb family of Cremona;99 and a "vir de progenie fulguris coruscantis", Bishop Giovanni IV Fulgosi of Pavia (1330-42).100 A "leonculus evangelistarum de familia beluarum" whom Opicinus mentions as a travel companion1io1 cannot be identified with certainty, but a guess might be tried: the "leo evangelista- rum" is of course Mark, so the "leonculus" would be a Marcello. A family of "beluae" would be something like Lupi, Orsi or Gatti. The last name is among the known family names in Pavia;102 but Opicinus does not state that the man in question came from Pavia. To the modern reader such things might be irritating; it is true that the border line between etymology and play upon words was uncertain in the Middle Ages,103 but the problems involved were taken seriously. When the most admired orator of Opicinus's age, Cardinal Petrus Rogerii, the later Pope Clement VI, preached a burial sermon for Cardinal Napoleone Orsini, he took as his text the words "leonem et ursum interfeci" from SReg. I7, 36, and dissected the name Neapoleo: the ne meaning the things which the deceased man wanted to avoid: "ne Deus re- cordaretur de suis flagitiis"; "ne perderetur cum impiis", etc., the po indicating that "in polo [heaven] est eius portio et positio", etc.104 This is on the same level as the speci- mens of Opicinus's etymological lucubrations.
