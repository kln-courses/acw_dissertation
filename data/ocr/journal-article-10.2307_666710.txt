HUTCHINSON, Yale University Professor Bernhard Rensch is perhaps the most learned living zoologist in the clas- sical tradition. In this book, which represents a revision of a second edition of a German work, he has given us a volume that is of great importance for two reasons. Firstly, it presents a sensible and convincing view, with an enormous amount of illustrative de- tail, of the present position of evolutionary theory in a way unfamiliar to most American readers. Secondly, it may well constitute a foundation on which a very impressive building might arise in the future. Evolution Above the Species Level actually begins with a discussion of intraspecific evolution, for Rensch's first theme is that the processes involved in the production of major groups are not different from those involved in subspecific and specific differentia- tion. Every phylum was a species once. In dealing with evolution at or below the species level, Rensch on the whole adopts the present day position that geographic isolation is of paramount importance; he was in fact one of the major proponents of this idea over thirty years ago. It is therefore interesting and important to notice that he is far from being dogmatic that geographical isolation is always involved in the increase in number of species. The subject of transspecific evolution is introduced in chapter 4 in which the di- versity of adaptation in many lines is contrasted with the apparent directional evolu- tion in others. Along with most modern biologists Rensch believes that the evolving line is opportunistic within its capacities and is not unfolding a pre-existing program, as some orthogeneticists have held. Nevertheless, the properties of both the material uni- verse in general and of living organisms in particular set obvious conditions on evolu- tion and also determine more subtly the probable most effective way of solving an evolu- tionary problem. It is therefore usually possible to detect similarities in the evolution- ary histories of related or ecologically analogous lines, and so to draw up a list of rules of kladogenesis or phyletic branching. More than a third of Rensch's book is taken up in discussing such rules. Of these rules, which have the logical status of tendency or prob- ability statements, one known generally as Cope's Rule, namely, that there is a high probability that successive species in a line will increase in size, has a quite peculiar im- portance. It is important to bear in mind what we should mean by our statement of the rule. What probably happens whenever a considerable amount of kladogenesis takes place is that in the different resulting lines size changes, generally, though not always, increasing, though at different rates in different lines. Some of those becoming large most rapidly often become extinct and later may be replace ' by other large forms de- rived from slower evolving lines. The statement of the rule is therefore that the dis- tribution of size change in kladogenesis tends to be skewed towards increasing size. It is unfortunate that in no very good case can a real distribution be described quantita- tively, though experience makes it practically certain that the rule, in this form, must apply to a great many organisms. The enormous importance of Cope's Rule-entries in the index referring to the rule are exceeded only by the related matters of "giant animal" and "brain"-is due to the fact that any change in size is apt to imply a change in proportions, partly for mechan- [63, 1961]</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 881 ical, partly for more subtle reasons. In the ontogeny and evolution of vertebrates, an increase in size involves an absolute increase, but relative decrease, in brain size. The size of the nerve cells increases in this case with the increasing absolute size of brain, but this probably means that they can each have more intercellular dendritic connections in a large animal than a small. Much of Rensch's long middle chapter on kladogenesis is devoted to a unique discussion of this type of material, incorporating original results from his laboratory based on a vast diversity of animals from all over the world. In final chapters the problems of progressive evolution and the evolution of consciousness are considered. The very difficult problems, pseudoproblems to some, involved in con- sciousness are considered seriously from a hylopsychic standpoint. The factual material on the evolution of certain kinds of behavior is mustered in Rensch's usual fascinating way. Some may not find illumination in his philosophical position, which follows from Spinoza through Fechner and Ziehen, to name only three illustrious philosophers. It is at least healthy to find that Rensch is one of the few modern scientific writers who is not afraid of taking an anthropomorphic view of man. The importance of this book is, as has been said, twofold. It brings together, from a coherent point of view, a vast mass of information. It then seems to imply "Go on from here and see what can be discovered." This is very timely. It is likely that the decade of the 1960's will see an unprecedented development of the study of transspecific evolu- tion, because for the first time it should be possible, by means of radiogeochemical techniques, such as argon-potassium dating, to obtain a valid, detailed time scale, at least for significant parts of the Tertiary. This should make evolutionary paleontology into a predictive science, allowing the testing of alternative hypotheses. For example, if, as has so often been supposed, many large and grotesque structures, often called hypertelic, have resulted from positive phylogenetic allometry, as size increased ac- cording to Cope's Rule, we should expect the increase in size to have less and less selec- tive value in view of the inconvenience of horns and bosses growing disproportionately larger. This at least has often been supposed. As Rensch says, all "such hypertelic struc- tures must be regarded as allometric by-products of increased body size, which were tolerable as long as they did not reach harmful dimensions or prove unfavorable." If this is really the whole explanation, any line exhibiting evolution of this sort should evolve at a decreasing rate approaching asymptotically to a condition in which the ad- vantage of increased body size is balanced by the disadvantage of excessive develop- ment of hypertelic structures. If in good lineages with a real absolute time-scale this asymptotic type of evolution is found not to occur, we should have to erect other hypotheses. A number of other related problems will become accessible, and some of these involve concepts of considerable depth and generality. What really sets the pace of evolution in any actual case is, in fact, largely unknown. It is almost certain that when we have not only a quantitative, but a geochronometrically detailed and reliable paleontology, properly integrated with environmental studies by the use of sound ecological theory, there will be a number of surprises. Whatever the results, this new paleontology will bear greatly on the evolution of man. The fortunate young workers who want to develop this potential new field cannot do better than to study Rensch's book in all its elaborate detail, and then let their imaginations range over the facts. The book is well produced and well translated, though the verbally particular naturalist will be worried by St. Hilda for St. Kilda and by occasional confusion be- tween butterflies and moths.</page></plain_text>
