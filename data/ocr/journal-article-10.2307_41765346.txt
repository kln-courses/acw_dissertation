<plain_text><page sequence="1">Allen S. Weiss Impossible Possibles In his article "Paul Claudel exégète du Japon," Maurice Pinguet tempers his homage to his illustrious predecessor with a list of errors contained in ClaudePs writings, among which we find: "He sees fifteen stones in the garden of Ryoan-ji, which only has fourteen."1 That none of my acquaintances who know both the article and the garden in question noted Pingueťs error - and that no corrective footnote is offered - is symptomatic, for the karesansui (dry garden; literally "dry mountain water") of Ryoan-ji was conceived to foster precisely this type of confusion. For nearly everyone who visits Ryoan-ji knows that from any given vantage point, only 14 of the 15 stones are visible (or so they think). Whatever may be the sublime meditative heights attainable in this garden, the main activity of the myriad of schoolchildren who visit it is reduced to counting the stones over and over as they move across the veranda, with the inevitable unabashed astonishment to discover what they already knew; that they will never arrive at a full count of 15. This is because they don't know the secret, which also escapes most commentators: if viewed from the right corner pillar of the temple by a person over six feet tall, all 15 stones become visible. In any case, the children are not tall enough, as would also have been the case of most Japanese at the time the garden was laid out, around 1499. It is telling that the only totalizing viewpoint is one that is improbable, if not quite impossible, being just beyond the reach (and the knowledge) of most visitors. The garden's design plays upon the equivocation of a series of incomplete views, complicated by two facts: first, the laws of visual gestalts reveal that most people cannot easily intuit the number count of more than approximately ten assembled objects; second, the viewing protocols of Zen gardens limit the possible viewpoints, since one cannot enter the garden. These factors conspire to trans- form this sublime garden into a visual conundrum: the undecidability between the multiple, ostensible viewpoints and the single secret perspective. In general, the Zen garden is a perpetual play of thresh- olds and passages, statics and dynamics, pictorial views and abstract spaces. The effects of movement (whether lateral, 69 1.

Another example of this confusion is to be found in the essay by Takemitsi Oba and Sondra Castile, "Immortals and Sages: Paintings from Ryoanji Temple," The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin , $1, no. 1 (Summer, 1 99Í): 11. Here the ground plan of the garden details only 14 stones. An even more egregious error occurs in Bernard Rudofsky's The Kimono Mind: An Informal Guide to Japan and the Japanese (New York: Doubleday, 1965), 236-37, where a two-page reproduction of Ryoan-ji bears the following caption: "The notorious sand garden of Ryoanji Temple near Kyoto. The dotted lines of the woodcut convey the eerie beauty of the sand patterns far better than do pho- tographs. From an undated garden book." Apparently Rudofsky's sense of "architecture without architects" (to cite the title of his most famous book) was far more accurate than that of his eye for gardens with gardeners, as neither the sand patterns, the stone formations and groupings, nor the form of the garden resemble Ryoan-ji. Even if the error is in the engraving, it is also in his eye.

The angles of vision, relationship between elements, implied horizon lines, effects of closure, degree of framing, play of thresholds, narrative allusions, and symbolic implications are all transformed, not only by the particular point of view chosen along the corridor, but also according to whether one is sitting, standing, or walk- ing (all appropriate attitudes for Zen meditation). Due to the small scale of most karesansui , the viewpoint changes as one moves about, and since the corridors are only approximately three feet above ground level, the mere difference between sitting and standing often entails a prodigious change in per- spective, which may alternately (and often simultaneously and equivocally) be frontal, oblique, or aerial - if such terms still have any meaning in such a context, which is doubtful. Indeed, these considerations complicate relations between the planar and the volumetric aspects of these gardens, given that the perspectivai effects of walls and stones, for example, change so greatly with even the slightest movement. In the extremely restricted space of the dry Zen garden, a mere few steps, even the tilt of the head, may effect transformations of cosmic dimensions. Some of these gardens are narrower than the height of an average person, and one's shadow may well cover an entire landscape. Others are so subtle that they may not be immediately recognized as gardens but literally passed over as one crosses a walkway or enters a building. A garden or not a garden - that is the question. This perceptual confusion is confounded by a conceptual particularity: of all the classic Zen-inspired dry gardens, Ryoan-ji is one of the rare ones in which the stones are unnamed, hence its iconographie ambiguity. This is surely one of the factors that led to the Western view of this garden as abstract and minimal (rather than a representation of mountainous islands on a vast ocean), an interpretation con- temporaneous with International Style modernism. (Philip Johnson is said to have burst into tears upon seeing Ryoan-ji.) In comparison, the extraordinary garden at Daisen-in (a sub- temple of Daitoku-ji) is composed of approximately 100 stones, all of which bear names (variously denoting stone types, unique qualities, or use -values): Buddha's foot impres- sion stone, turtle's head stone, immovable stone, Zazen (seated meditation) stone, splash of waves stone, Dharma stone, bright mirror stone, dragon's head stone, tiger's head 70</page><page sequence="3">One stone in the garden at Ryoan-ji, Japan.

Typical of the interpretation of Ryoan-ji as abstract and minimal, which has practically become the standard read- ing, is that of Thomas Hoover, who explains in Zen Culture : Unlike Daisen-iny the garden at Ryoan-ji is not a symbolic moun- tain scene . It is instead a work of abstract art on a canvas of sand that goes beyond a symbolic representation of a landscape scene to provide a distillation of the very universe. It is internationally regarded as the very essence of Zen, and it is almost impossible to describe, in either words or pictures. . . . Between them, the gardens at Daisen-in and Ryoan-ji encompass the range of kare sansui gardening in Ashikaga era Japan. The first is a symbolic landscape of parched waterfalls and simulated streams drawn in monochro- matic granite; the second, a totally nonrepresentative abstraction of stone arrangements in the sand-covered 'flat garden' style.1 Another version, written by a landscape theorist, is François Berthier's claim: "Just as the landscape suggested by the garden at Ryoanji is abstract, the one at Daisen-in is given quite concrete expression," clarified by the explana- tion: "It is precisely because the significance of this garden remains vague that it is so rich in meaning: it is because it is shrouded in mystery that it offers everyone a large margin of fantasy."* In fact, this "vague" significance should suggest a broad scope of metaphoricity rather than its lack, such that the tension between iconography and abstraction is high- lighted, not nullified. One might go so far as to suggest that Ryoan-ji is a sort of concrete koan, that Zen exercise of question-and-answer intended to foster enlightenment by short-circuiting rational and logical processes and thrusting 71 2.

The reduction of this garden to abstraction and minimalism would eliminate the equivoca- tion and paradox central to Zen, and diminish the garden's complexity and mystery by limiting interpretive possibilities. Simply stated, the iconography of Ryoan-ji is implicit, not explicit; allusive, not evident. While there is indeed a Zen principle of mystery, obscurity, unknowability (jugen ), this in no way obviates consideration of the mythical, represen- tational, and iconographie foundations of this garden.4 The laws of noncontradiction do not hold in Zen: temp- tation of the void indeed inspires iconoclasm, but this in no way implies that it doesn't simultaneously admit iconogra- phy. The Western disregard of Ryoan-ji's iconography was instigated by Bruno Tauťs high-modernist appreciation of the garden in the light of minimalist and antidecorative modernist imperatives; a parallel valorization of abstraction was accentuated and disseminated by D.T. Suzuki's famed lectures at Columbia University, where his iconoclastic inter- pretations of Rinzai Zen overshadowed the long and com- plex iconographie history of Pure Land Buddhism, which had informed garden design for centuries. This position was brought to the awareness of a broad art-world public by Suzuki's most famous student, John Cage, whose theory and practice of indeterminacy in the arts is a direct offshoot of 72 4. Ever since the landmark exhibition "The Spiritual in Art: Abstract Painting 1890-1985" (Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 1986) and up through the recent "Aux Origines de l'abstraction 1800-1914" (Musée d'Orsay, 2003), even the most seemingly recondite abstraction has been seen to contain some level of representation, whether physical or metaphysical.</page><page sequence="5">this tradition; and this viewpoint culminated in the Deleuzian-Cagean position of philosopher-musicologist Daniel Charles: a radical denial of iconography, which a pri- ori excludes "anthropomorphic" readings so as to dismiss all representational possibilities.5 There is an anecdote to the effect that Cage, a great lover of Ryoan-ji, suggested that the positions of the stones were not chosen according to carefully determined aesthetic, sym- bolic, or metaphysical calculations, but that the emptiness of the sand permitted them to be placed anywhere whatsoever. This Duchampian supposition reveals more about Cage than about the Zen garden. In 1983, Cage composed the first of several versions of a musical work entitled Ryoanji , and in 1992 he produced Where R = Ryoanji y a work of graphite on paper consisting of 15 pebbles randomly placed on a page and encircled to create the graphic elements. This phantasmatic representation of the garden eliminates the numerical conundrum, the tension between abstraction and figuration, and the iconographie mystery, all of which contribute to the richness of the actual garden. Cage always said that he wished to work not in imitation of nature, but in imitation of nature's processes. However, as nothing is known of how the gardeners originally formulated their conception of the site, it is not a foregone conclusion that the process of creat- 73 5.

Cage's position may easily be extrap- olated to a reductio ad absurdum confusing singularity with genre, such that any disposition of stones on any empty field would be aesthetically equivalent, thus conflating Ryoan-ji with all Zen gardens composed of the same number of stones. Cage valorized the indeterminacy of the process over the equivocation of the object. Perhaps this situation arose from the difference between Cage identifying with the cre- ator rather than the spectator: he sought the pure indetermi- nate potentiality of the creative moment, while ignoring the determinate indeterminacy between multiple and single viewpoints in the actual garden. Indeed, part of the attraction of the Zen garden rests on equivocation, as Günther Nitschke explains: "In the opinion of garden expert Mirei Shigemori, the kare-samui garden reflects two aesthetic ideals fundamental to Muromachi thinking: jugen , a profound and austere elegance concerning a multi-layered symbolism, and johaku no biy the beauty of empty space."6 Concerning Ryoan-ji, the congruence of its forms with those of other karesansui , the specifics of its his- toric and iconographie context, and the sundry appreciations of poets and writers over the centuries all suggest that this garden is profoundly representational. To see Ryoan-ji as purely abstract is an anachronistically modernist attitude. Furthermore, the karesansui of Ryoan-ji is directly related to the temple's sliding wall panel paintings (fusumd). The monochromatic meditative paintings that had originally dec- orated the temple were eventually replaced by extravagant Momoyama era (1570-1610) works painted by the circle of Kano Eitoku. These paintings, placed in the three rooms fac- ing the garden (public entrance, ceremonial room, patron's room), respectively represent the motifs of Tiger and Bamboo , The Chinese Immortals, and The Four Elegant Accomplishments ? The relation of their iconography to the dry garden, which preceded them by several years, is beyond the scope of this essay, but it would be imprudent to assume that the meaning and use -value of the garden remained unchanged when faced with the radical iconographie, cultural, and political upheavals that took place at this moment of Japan's unifica- tion. It is immediately apparent that the jagged, irregular rock formations and the empty gold ground of the paintings are aesthetically congruent with the forms of the garden. Insofar as this new iconography represented the idealized, Utopian landscapes of the Chinese Immortals, might not the 74 6.

The recent discovery that two panels donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1989 are from Ryoan-ji, as docu- mented in Immortals and Sages , is of monumental importance in understand- ing this garden, and it is astonishing that it has hardly inflected current interpre- tations.</page><page sequence="7">Allen S.

It would be unreasonable to consider the meaning of Ryoan-ji without taking into account this ancient, syncretic, and highly sym- bolic iconography, which enriches the garden's profound formal austerity with a great conceptual complexity. Most Zen gardens are like haiku, with representational schemes that are symbolically rich but circumscribed by highly deter- minate sets of codes. Ryoan-ji is unique in that, while par- taking in the broadest sense of the same symbolic field, its metaphors are open-ended and partially indeterminate. The lesson of Ryoan-ji should not be lost on the other arts. A famed Zen dictum states that before enlightenment, a mountain is just a mountain; during the quest for enlighten- ment, a mountain is everything but a mountain; after enlightenment, a mountain is once again just a mountain. In a sense, this is an allegory of the process of metaphorization at the core of Japanese aesthetics, one that holds true for the stone "mountains" of Zen gardens. Equivocation is articu- lated across history in many forms. In the Zen tradition - where metaphorization and miniaturization are key design features - we are occasionally given to wonder whether a site is or is not a garden. Vision is fulfilled by motion, perfec- tion is supplemented by ambiguity, and transcendence is acknowledged as yet another position of immanence. 75</page></plain_text>
