Here he argues that any mature representation, and any attempt to communicate such representation is inescapably 'a moral acť.1 It is this connection between representation and moral value that I want to pursue, by arguing that representations of nature are implicated in moral evaluations which, in turn, have built into them incipient strategies for dealing with what are perceived to be environmental problems. The natural, the cultural, and the moral, I contend, have always been intimately related, indeed mutually constituted, as my title, The polity of nature', is intended to indicate. That this is no latter-day trope, moreover, is evident from the fact that Linnaeus presided over a dissertation of this title - Politia naturae - which was presented by C. Daniel Wilcke at the University of Uppsala in 1760.2 The natural order? For all its apparent simplicity, the idea of nature turns out to be extremely complex. Arthur Lovejoy, for example, identified sixty-six different meanings of the word.3 Here, I want to pick out just three ways of representing nature and show how these have influenced stances taken up towards the environment. Each incorporates a dominant vision of nature, or, to put it another way, a different metaphorical concep- tion of the world. Of course they all interweave in subtle and complex ways, and each encompasses a range of conceptual inflections. I aim simply to provide an outline map of the territory by identifying major trends of thought, so that we can begin to cut a path through this forbidding terrain. In due course I shall suggest that these dif- ferent visions tend to induce different stances towards environment, and to foster rather different environmental values.

Livingstone dominion over nature, and so on. According to feminists like Carolyn Merchant, this is not insignificant; it speaks of a gendered polarization between the human and the natural. This was not always so. Prior to the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century, the natural order was thought of as an organism, a living being, and it was the coming of the Mechanical Universe of Galileo, Newton, and Bacon that killed if off. Herein, Merchant claims, lies the origin of modern environmental despoliation: in the substitution of an inert, mechanistic model of nature for an earlier, life-filled, organic vision. Hence she begins The death of nature with the lament: The world we have lost was organic.'4 Of course, Merchant's argument is not just that people used to think of nature as a living thing. It is, to be more precise, that they thought of nature as female - Mother Nature.5 Thus Fludd's The female soul of the world' and Kircher's 'Isis', both pictor- ial representations, depict nature's rhythms and cyclical forces in gendered terms. Now, she argues, this female image of the earth as a nurturing mother had a culturally constraining effect on human action. During the Renaissance, for example, mining enterprises were only entered upon reluctantly and after various ceremonial rites - fasting, strict cleanliness, and so on - because they were regarded as a violation of the living earth. The 'normative constraint' that images of this sort induced was suffi- ciently powerful, she argues, to require the production of works like Georg Agricola's De re metallica (1556) to conspire in the liberation of mining enterprises from the restrictions of the organic vision. The shift towards mechanism, of course, was not purely intellectual - far from it. For Merchant, the demise of the idea of nature as a gendered organism was intimately connected with the social transformation to capi- talism, with its attendant class and gender alienations. And the consequences were dramatic: nature was dominated, environment exploited. It was the death of nature in every sense. While organicist ways of thinking were progressively to diminish in the wake of the Scientific Revolution, they certainly did not disappear from Western consciousness. To the contrary. In the past century or so, organismic modes of thought have blos- somed in the development of ecological thinking - and in its accompanying ideologi- cal preoccupations. Consider first, in this regard, the case of Ernst Haeckel (1834-1919), who coined the term 'ecology' in 1866 and developed a comprehensive organic ideology. I use the word 'ideology' advisedly; while Haeckel - like other nine- teenth-century biogeographers - emphasized the holistic character of the natural order, he also identified himself with the Monist League in Germany. The monists urged that humans and animals shared a common moral constitution, and that nature was the source of all truth. The religiosity detectable in this holistic vision was central to monist ecology, which insisted on the inherent unity of the natural and the spiritual, and sought for the retrieval of a god-impregnated nature that Christianity had banished. It was an attempt to reverse the disenchantment of nature effected by the scientific tradition. So, when Haeckel's disciples pursued issues like soil erosion and resource conservation, these were simply the practical outworking of their reli- gion of nature.6 Similar sentiments also found favour with Frank Fraser Darling, a leading conser- vation spokesman during the 1960s. In his Reith Lectures on 'Wilderness and plenty' in 1969, for example, he called on the West to adopt 'the philosophy of wholeness' or 'the truth of Zoroastrianism . . . that we are all of one stuff, difference is only in Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="3">The polity of nature: representation, virtue, strategy 355 degree, and God can be conceived as being in all and of all, the sublime and divine immanence'.7 More recently, organicism has been further rejuvenated in the much- publicized Gaia hypothesis advocated by James Lovelock, a scientist who has worked for NASA and Hewlett Packard. Gaia, of course, was the Greek earth goddess.8 The idea here is that the earth must be regarded as a super-organism, with a capacity for maintaining its own equilibrium and recovering from damage in much the same way as bodies recover from illness.9 Lovelock describes the global system as 4 the largest liv- ing organism' and 'a complex entity involving the Earth's biosphere, atmosphere, oceans and soil; the totality constituting a feedback or cybernetic system which seeks an optimal physical and chemical environment for life on earth'.10 Similarly implicated in the organic vision is the 'Deep Ecology' movement champi- oned by the Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess. His project, inaugurated in 1972, is to challenge the 'shallow' ecology of those whose conservation outlook does not go beyond 'the health and affluence of people in the developed countries'.11 Deep ecol- ogy is, contrarily, not human-centred.12 It celebrates the close partnership of all forms of life, and insists on the equal right to live and blossom. Thus the deep ecology movement rejects the separation of humanity from the rest of the natural order and celebrates the intrinsic value of every form of life. To deep ecologists, talk of 'resource management' or 'resource conservation' is hopelessly shallow, displaying a complacent reformism too comfortable with the dominant social ideology of capitalism.13 While Lovelock claims scientific objectivity for his Gaia hypothesis, and the deep ecologists call for social reform, others find in organicism inspiration for what is called the New Paganism, and the restoration of worship of the Earth Goddess. Whether 'as wicca, healing witchcraft, the religion of the Celtic druids, or 21s magic', it has been estimated that 'as many as 100,000 people in the United States may prac- tise a form of nature religion, animism, or pantheism'.14 All of this can be seen as part of the New Age rejection of scientific rationalism and the Enlightenment pro- ject, and the perpetuation of organic ways of thinking about the natural world that flourished during the medieval period. Mechanism: a clockwork universe An altogether different conception of nature gained impetus with the advent of the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century. Here the dominant image was that of the machine. The triumph of this mechanical vision over both Aristotelianism and hermeticism was due in large measure to the search for laws governing the physical world, and to the belief that the constituent elements of the great machinery of nature were 'assumed to act because of their configurations, the contacts between them, and the transfer of motion from part to part'.15 Through the writings of figures like Descartes, Newton, and Boyle the triumph of the mechanical system was secured. According to Merchant the new science, particularly as championed by Francis Bacon, 'fashioned a new ethic sanctioning the exploitation of nature'. And Baconian rhetoric, she believes, dramatically displays how the exploitation of women and the exploitation of nature are umbilically connected. When Bacon spoke of interrogating nature and torturing it through mechanical devices, he drew on a repertoire of legal Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="4">356 David N. Livingstone techniques deployed for investigating witchcraft. The techniques of witchcraft inqui- sition, he mused, could throw light on the investigation of nature: Neither am I of opinion . . . that superstitious narratives of sorceries, witchcrafts, charms, dreams, divinations, and the like, where there is an assurance and clear evidence of the fact, should be altogether excluded . . . [for] a useful light may be gained, not only for a true judgment of the offences of persons charged with such practices, but likewise for the fur- ther disclosing of the secrets of nature. Neither ought a man to make scruple of entering and penetrating into these holes and corners, when the inquisition of truth is his whole object.16 In this way nature was dominated, 'bound into service', made a 'slave', put 'in con- straint,' and 'moulded' by mechanical arts. Seen in this light, science and its technol- ogy become instruments of power, in just the same way as the judiciary exercised power in the interrogation of accused witches. The shift from an organic to a mechanistic vision, of course, was not effected in cerebral isolation from changing social conditions; rather, this transformation was intertwined with the lengthy and complex shift from manorial farm economics towards market capitalism, with its marked ecological consequences. The widespread diffusion of windmills (for the draining of the fen), the growth in watermills, and the use of timber as an energy source, together with population growth and taxation, according to Merchant, 'led to the breakdown of the medieval agrarian economy and ecosystem'.17 In northern Europe especially, production for subsistence was replaced by production for the market. Soon a wide range of agricultural 'how-to' improve- ment books for the yeoman farmer began to make their appearance. William Blith's The English improver improved (1652), for example, promised double, sixfold, even ten- fold yield increases with the use of various new mechanical techniques: draining fen, reducing bog, reclaiming sea lands, composting, new crops, exterminating vermin. The environmental effects were plainly dramatic. If the new science initiated profound environmental change, it was within the mechanical philosophy that an incipient managerialism began to form. A variety of conservationist principles thus began to emerge. Concerned at wasteful land prac- tices, John Evelyn (1620-1706), a founding member of the Royal Society and as such committed to the new scientific vision, published in 1662 his famous Silva, A discourse of forest trees and the propagation of timber in His Majesty 's dominions. Because the supply of timber had already dropped to an alarmingly low level, the Commissioners of the Navy had called upon the advisory services of the Royal Society, and Evelyn respond- ed by appealing for the institution of sound conservation practices. He drew atten- tion to agricultural encroachment on forest land, highlighted the problems of unrestrained grazing, and warned of dangers from mining enterprises through their demand for charcoal in metal-working.18 To be sure, his outlook was motivated by the philosophy of self-interest and acquisitiveness, and amounted to a call for enlight- ened exploitation of resources; it was, to put it another way, conservationist rather than preservationist. Thoroughly utilitarian, Evelyn did not hesitate to recommend intervention in natural systems by recommending that wet land be drained by canals, and sluices to regulate water supply. Earlier, Evelyn had devoted his attention to the subject of air pollution in London in his Fumifugium (1661), lamenting its effects on human health, as did John Graunt, Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="5">The polity of nature: representation, virtue, strategy 357 who presented his Natural and political observations upon the bills of mortality of 1662 - a demographic analysis - within the context of the new science. Evelyn urged that air pollution could be combated by the planting and reforestation of timber tracts out- side London, and by the removal of all trades using coal in their forges and furnaces to new locations outside the city. Graunt, using comparative population ratios, direct- ed his readers' attention to the high incidence of pulmonary disorders in the metrop- olis. As for unhealthiness, it may well be supposed, that although seasoned Bodies may, and do live near as long in London , as elsewhere, yet new comers and Children do not: for the Smoaks, Stinks , and close Air ; are less healthful than that of the Country; otherwise why do sickly Persons remove into the Country-Air?19 The emergence of this managerialist environmentalism, wedded to the insights of the new science, during this period owed a good deal to the mushrooming of a natural theology designed to uncover the ways in which the orderliness of the world machine attested to the sovereignty and beneficence of its Grand Architect or - perhaps better - Divine Mechanic.20 Within this scheme, humans were seen as having a responsibility to exercise stewardship over the natural world to ensure that the marks of its designer were not effaced. Certainly this was a system in which the world was made for human society and had superiority over the animal world. But God was a wise conservationist and people, made in His image, were to act as caretakers of His world.21 During the mid-seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries this form of benefi- cent dominion surfaced in the writings of Sir Matthew Hale and William Derham. Hale, England's mid-seventeenth century Lord Chief Justice, told his readers in 1677 that the human race was created to be God's viceroy, and that the dominion and stewardship roles that had been accorded to it were for the purpose of curbing the fiercer animals, protecting the other species, and preserving plant life. It was the task of humankind 'to preserve the face of the Earth in beauty, usefulness and fruitful- ness'.22 As for Derham, his Physico-theology of 1713 outlined a range of ecologically sound principles - population stability, ecological interdependence, and species adaptation are all to be found. Certainly Derham claimed divine benediction on the various instruments of astronomy, navigation, geography, geometry, and arithmetic; theological justification for the activities of trade, manufacture, and increasing wealth was thus secured. But it does seem to me that Coleman overstates the case when he depicts Derham's managerialism as sanctioned by a 'divine command to steel our- selves for a relentless assault upon nature'.23 For the rhetoric of mastery and domin- ion, undoubtedly present though it is, was modulated by Derham's stewardship vision, which acknowledged that the Creator's 'Infinite Wisdom and Care conde- scends, even to the Service, and Wellbeing of the meanest, most weak, and helpless insensitive Parts of the Creation'.24 Such figures as these, I suggest, were in effect promulgating a new manageńal approach to environment, adapted to the rationalizing tendencies of the new mechanical world order. Efficiency, production, management: these were the watch- words of these pioneer conservationists. The aim was for long-term planning, the maximization of energy production, sustained yield, ecosystem control, and the application of science to policy formation. It would ultimately issue in modern day cost-benefit analysis, the concept of sustainable development, and environmental Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="6">358 David N. Livingstone impact assessment. Underneath these procedures lies the mechanical vision first sys- tematically articulated in the seventeenth century. Economy : the organization of nature Although the term 'ecology' was only coined in the nineteenth century, it resonated with another concept that had been widely applied to nature in the eighteenth centu- ry - economy ( Oekonomie) . Philologically, this term is derived from the Greek word oikos, which was originally used to describe the household unit; the idea was that this unit was a self-sufficient, coherent, stable, integrated community - the very concepts that came to be applied to natural ecosystems. Indeed, the term 'ecology' was itself a substitute for the earlier and widespread designation, 'the economy of nature'.25 Haeckel, for example, spoke of 'Ecology or the theory of the economy of nature' in his General morphology of 1866; and Richard Hesse defined ecology as 'the science of the "domestic economy" of plants and animals'.26 For my purposes, this association is particularly significant for two reasons: first because it shows the strong reciprocal links between thinking about social economy and natural order, and secondly, because early proponents of the 'economy of nature' or the 'polity of nature' typical- ly cast the Creator in the role of divine economist. Allow me to turn first to that great rationalist undertaking of the Enlightenment: the taxonomie system of the Swedish botanist Linnaeus (Carl von Linné, 1707-78). He is famed, of course, for the system of binomial nomenclature that he devised, which imposed a rational order on the seemingly endless varieties in nature. But what fired his taxonomie enthusiasm was his profound conviction that he was unearthing the very order of God's creation: he saw himself as a second Adam - the namer extraordinaire. A major clue to the character of this great designer is to be found in an essay Linnaeus penned in 1749, 'The oeconomy of nature' - a key state- ment of ecological principle. The purpose was to detect the hand of God in nature's order; so it was a piece of rational religion. In this system, all living things were bound together into a chain of interlocking links; even the living and dead were con- nected in what we would nowadays call food chains. But more, humans had been licensed by the heavenly economist to control other species by the use of reason, for everything could 'be made subservient to his [man's] use'.27 Linnaeus' concepts are thus drawn both from theology and politics: God was the Supreme Economist and Housekeeper. For the analogy was with a well-run house- hold under the watchful eye of a beneficent housekeeper. The fundamental assump- tion of the Linnaeans was that the 'economy' of nature was designed to maximize production and efficiency. The Linnaean system could at once confute atheism . . . and justify the social order. It was, as Donald Worster tellingly comments, an ecology that 'strongly echoed the values of the Manchester and Birmingham industrialists and of the English agricultural reformers of the same period'. Students of political economy and of the economy of nature reinforced each other's outlook. So it is no surprise that, later, Thomas Ewbank (writing in 1855) could observe that the general economy of the world 'was designed for a Factory' by the great Designer.28 Besides, as Alan Bewell has effectively demonstrated, eighteenth-century botany became the vehicle through which questions about society, sexuality, and social class were rou- Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="7">The polity of nature: representation, virtue, strategy 359 tinely addressed; the very categories used to characterize plant morphology were imported from human society and anatomy.29 A political economy of nature is also detectable in what has been called the 'Arcadian vision' of Gilbert White, born in Selborne in 1720. His posthumous fame rests almost exclusively on his book The natural history of Selborne , published in 1789. Here White recorded the natural order of his little parish, studying everything from taxonomy and ornithology to seasonal change. Throughout, there is a pervasive sense of the area's complex unity in diversity; and not surprisingly. For Providence had contrived to make 'Nature ... a great economist/ This necessitated a profound re- evaluation of current values about the higher and lower creatures: The most insignificant insects and reptiles are of much more consequence, and have much more influence in the economy of nature, than the incurious are aware of . . . Earthworms, though in appearance a small and despicable link in the chain of nature, yet, if lost would make a lamentable chasm.30 Here was a political economy of nature; everything fitted together 'economically'. But there were ways in which human intervention could further help; preserving these delicate relationships required planning and forethought in order that Selborne could continue to satisfy human needs. Such sentiments, of course, were in keeping both with White's communitarian loy- alty to local soil and with his rustic vision of simple, natural people flourishing under Providence and pastor. The coming of the factory system, however, was already creat- ing a different society. The new mode of production, fired by imports from the New World, was relentlessly imposing on workers an entirely different set of rhythms - those of the clock and the machine, rather than the daily or seasonal ebb and flow of nature. Agriculture was undergoing rapid change in the Midlands as the soil became commercialized. Although it was not until the twentieth century that a sort of White cult began to reassert the salience of his communitarian environmentalism, the idea that there were 'nations' of plants, each with their own geographical provinces, topographical features, and member species, was widely espoused during the eighteenth and nine- teenth centuries by such figures as Johann Reinhold Forster, Eberhardt Zimmermann, and Alexander von Humboldt.31 This vegetational regionalism was typ- ically embedded within a more general regional geography that incorporated both physical and human features. Of Humboldt, for example, Janet Browne writes that he 'treated plant associations almost as if they were human "nations" . . . Humboldt was the statesman - the "statist" - of the vegetable world.' 'The methods of early phyto- geographical analysis', she goes on, 'were therefore the same as those of statesmen interested in comparative statistics. . . . [Plant geographers] were concerned with the "political economy" of plants.'32 Similar connections are also discernible in the writ- ings of Goethe. During the last quarter of the eighteenth century, as a member of the privy council of the Weimar duchy, he devoted much time and effort to managerial and fiscal matters; not surprisingly, the notions of 'budget' and 'balance' became cru- cial to his efforts to reform the financial structure of the duchy. At the same time, as Myles Jackson has shown, Goethe was formulating his views of nature, and he deployed these self-same concepts in his depiction of the natural world as a perfect economy with 'inviolate balances'. The linkages between nature and polity, between Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="8">360 David N. Livingstone the physiology of plants and administrative accounting, were such that, to Goethe, the artificial budgets of the duchy, based on double-entry book-keeping, were actually inferior to natural budgets, which 'illustrated that nature was the perfect economy'.33 In the early twentieth century, ideas about the appropriate functioning of human economies and social communities continued to condition the new science of ecolo- gy. Perhaps chief among those spearheading this new discipline was the Danish plant geographer Eugenius Warming (1841-1924). His classic work was translated into English in 1909 as The oecology of plants: an introduction to the study of plant communities . Here he reviewed the impact of key habitat factors - humidity, soil, terrain, animals - on the growth and distribution of plants. For Warming the principal ecological unit was the Verein, or plant community. This community had a definite outward appear- ance; it also had what Coleman calls 'a definite general economy,' with a specific set of occupying life forms;34 and it was characterized by a form of interdependence that he called 'commensalism' - several species complementing each other's dietary habits. In sum, the plant community was a natural society of species with similar toler- ances. Given these preoccupations, it is no surprise to learn that later students of urban sociology, like Burgess and Park, should turn to Warming's work for insights into the role of competition, invasion, succession, and segregation in the formation of human communities.35 Indeed Burgess suggested that 'the student of community life or the community organization worker might secure at present a more adequate understanding of the basic factors in the natural organization of the community from Warming's Oecology of Plants . . . than from any other source'.36 Sociological resonances are also discernible in the tradition of 'dynamic ecology' championed by Frederic Clements (1874-1945). A chief concern of this tradition was the principle of 'successional development', and it was initially applied (by H. C. Cowles) to the investigation of vegetation along the sandy shores of Lake Michigan. Clearly there was vegetational succession in space , as well as in time: moving inland from the lakeshore, a shift from hydrophytes to xerophytes and finally to mesophytes could readily be detected. But as well as working on the dynamics of ecological suc- cession, Clements was fascinated by what he took to be the organic character of plant communities. For plant communities, just like individual plants or animals, under- went evolutionary change: they grew, matured, declined, and were replaced. It is surely appropriate to pause and ask where Clements derived this communitar- ian way of thinking? To be sure, organicism, as we have seen, has a long history in the Western intellectual tradition. But Ronald Tobey has made the intriguing suggestion that a major inspiration was the social thinking of Lester Frank Ward. Even the title of Ward's book, Dynamic sociology , which was widely read at Nebraska where Clements taught, suggestively resonated with Clements's 'dynamic ecology'.37 For Ward - a neo- Lamarckian evolutionist - environment was far more important than heredity in determining the constitution of society. This meant that there was reformist justifica- tion for intervention to alter environmental conditions and thereby induce social progress. The fundamental importance of environment, in particular climate, simi- larly undergirded Clements's dynamic ecology. Besides, Ward's Spencerian concep- tion of society (Tobey suggests) substantially informed Clements's representation of the vegetative formation as an integral community. In turn, Clements's views on suc- cessional change were culled by students of society, like Roderick McKenzie, for insights into the character of social change.38 Similarly drawing on Clementsian Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="9">The polity of nature: representation, virtue, strategy 361 sources, the sociologist Amos Hawley observed that 'ecology has been described as but an extension of economics ... to the whole realm of life. Such a statement is equally appropriate, though in a more limited sphere, of human ecology.'39 Here again we see the intimate and reciprocal links between thinking about human com- munities and plant ecology.40 Environmental values So far I have focused on different ways of thinking about the natural order, and I have argued that different metaphorical visions have been immensely influential. But it is plain, of course, that these intellectual stances have embedded within them moral forces too. Accordingly, I want to turn to some of the values that key environmental- ists have adopted, values which, as often as not, were believed to reside in nature itself.41 Piety The idea that nature is something to be revered has had its fair share of eloquent advocates, and continues to inform significant strands of the modern environmental movement. In large measure 'environmental pietists', as they may be characterized, draw inspiration from organic conceptions of nature. It is because nature is seen as a living thing that the language of contemplation, devotion, even veneration frequently obtrudes. This can be illustrated from examples on both sides of the Adantic, where the virtues of particular landscapes have frequently been portrayed in the language of piety. The English Lake District is now widely regarded as a 'landscape of national importance'. Late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century visitors, however, were not at all impressed with it as an area of outstanding natural beauty. To the contrary! Celia Fiennes - who hated the Pennines and was glad to descend from the mountains - thought the Lake District was 'desert and barren' and its mountains 'very terrible'.42 And Daniel Defoe had likewise found it 'barren and frightful' compared with what he called the pleasingly 'rich, populous and fruitful' Preston.43 It was only as the Romantic movement took hold towards the end of the eighteenth century that a change in perception began to occur. Under its influence, Dr John Brown (from Penrith) and Dr John Dalton (from Dean, near Cockermouth), in recounting their expeditions to the mountains, spoke of 'cliffs of stupendous height' and of their 'hor- rible grandeur'. Such literature, together with the romanticism of landscape painters like Turner, soon began to attract others to the area.44 William Wordsworth, a close friend of Turner, was profoundly influenced by such developments. Indeed the story of the emergence of the Lake District as an area of outstanding beauty that needed protection can be traced back to his Guide to the lakes (1810), in which he famously commented that 'persons of pure taste . . . deem the district a sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy'.45 And not surprisingly, for in Nature he could detect a 'holy plan' with symbolic and spiritual significance.46 Thus when the Manchester corporation advanced proposals to dam Lake Thirlmere, later Wordsworthian pietists like Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley, a scholar, athlete, and histo- Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="10">362 David N. Livingstone rían, campaigned for the preservation of the landscape from the depredations of com- mercialism. Their struggles ultimately crystallized in the establishment in 1883 of a permanent 'watchdog' organization, the Lake District Defence Society. Throughout their campaign, the strains of romanticism, frequently in the language of Ruskin, can be detected, strains also discernible on the other side of the Atlantic. Henry David Thoreau also celebrated the values of natural piety.48 He had gone to live at Waiden Pond, on 4 July 1845 (where he remained until 1847), perhaps because he did not see much to rejoice about in the nation's anniversary. For to him, the American people were dominated by materialist values and he sought an alterna- tive society. Thoreau found it in the wilderness - a surrogate civilization.49 Rejecting anthropocentrism, his environmental ethic thus sprang from an expanded sense of moral consciousness. This reversal in the conventional values of the time owed much to the influence of the transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson, who had expressed his faith in an 'Oversoul', a grand, godlike moral force that pervaded all things in nature.50 To Thoreau, then, the earth was not dead, inert matter; it had spiritual vital- ity. He thus persistently hankered after the primeval forest of pre-Puritan New England, and when he read Silva he found John Evelyn, its author, to be 'as good as several old druids' and the book 'a new kind of prayerbook, a glorifying of the trees and enjoying them forever'.51 This naturalistic piety induced a sympathy with nature which he considered superior to objectivist science, a vitalism much to be preferred to mechanism. Such piety, moreover, could induce a new kind of science: The true man of science will know nature better by his finer organization; he will smell, taste, see, hear, feel, better than other men. His will be a deeper and finer experience. We do not learn by inference and deduction, and the application of mathematics to philoso- phy, but by direct . . . sympathy. . . . The most scientific will still be the healthiest and friend- liest man, and possess a more perfect Indian wisdom.52 John Muir, wilderness champion and intellectual father of the Sierra Club was undoubtedly Thoreau's chief disciple.53 But it was two personal experiences that con- spired to induce in him a profound affirmation of nature. One was a period of blind- ness which afflicted him early in life. During this dark experience he vowed that, if his sight were to return, he would devote himself to the revelation of light in nature. Later, as a draft-dodger during the Civil War, he headed off for the Canadian wilder- ness. There, on a lonely trail, he encountered a cluster of rare orchids, and it struck him that, but for his chance encounter, they would have perished without ever being seen by human eye. Surely, he felt, their existence was first and foremost for them- selves . . . and the Creator; not for humanity. Muir thus set himself steadfastly against the ugly commercialism of late Victorian capitalism, and emerged as the hero of wilderness preservation. What he advocated was preservation - the preserving of wild areas for their beauty. His energies were focused on the High Sierra, and his greatest political achievement was the establishment of Yosemite National Park in 1890. As we shall presently see, however, there were opponents - conservationists - whom Muir dismissed as worshippers of the Almighty Dollar.54 The de-Christianization of much of Western intellectual life since Muir's day has not obliterated environmental piety, of course. For a secularized, or perhaps better, immanentist piety continues to find expression in numerous calls for respect for nature stemming from what has been called 'biospherical egalitarianism'. Arne Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="11">The polity of nature: representation, virtue, strategy 363 Naess, for example, observes that the 'ecological field-worker acquires a deep-seated respect, or even veneration, for ways and forms of life. He reaches an understanding from within, a kind of understanding that others reserve for fellow-men and for a narrow section of ways and forms of life.'55 That such sentiments can justifiably be labelled secular 'pietism' is evident from the frequency with which St Francis of Assisi is called upon as a kind of patron saint of nature. Bill Devall, for instance, derives intellectual sustenance from Francis's talk of the spiritual democracy of all creatures, as indeed did Lynn White Jr, one of the leading critics of Western Christianity's deal- ings with nature.56 Utility If, as I have been suggesting, organic conceptions of nature tend to induce environ- mental piety, mechanistic visions, I think, encourage very different environmental attitudes. As Michael Foster put it in 1959: 'The mental attitude of science is discon- tinuous with that of worship. It is an attitude different from contemplation, and one to which wonder is foreign, since its aim is to eliminate wonder.' Not surprisingly Foster noted that 'mastery of nature' was at the heart of the new science of the seven- 1 57 teenth 1 century. In the environmental context, I suggest that the dominant virtue arising from mechanical representations of the natural order is that of environmental utility; by this I mean the wise use of nature guided by the insights of science and a commit- ment to social progress. The fundamental principles of managerial conservationism owe a good deal to the activities of Gifford Pinchot, the US Chief Forester under Theodore Roosevelt.58 Indeed, it was Pinchot who succeeded in making a new idea - 'conservation' - a key element in Progressive politics. The historic conference of gov- ernors on conservation held in the White House in May 1908, which was fundamen- tally devoted to seeking a scientific means of managing the nation's resources, bears witness to the extent of Pinchot's political acumen. In order to gain control of the forest reserves, Pinchot had had to overcome the opposition of western senators and landowners who obviously resented federal meddling in land policy. But by mobiliz- ing politically influential miners, railwaymen, and representatives of grazing interests, Pinchot was able to exert sufficient pressure on congress to secure the passage of the Transfer Act, a piece of legislation that effectively gave him control of 86 million acres of forest land. These soon came to be called national forests. The conservation philosophy underlying Pinchot's policies are clearly expressed in the principles he enunciated for the new Forest Service: In the administration of the forest reserves it must be clearly borne in mind that all land is to be devoted to its most productive use for the permanent good of the whole people and not for the temporary benefit of individuals or companies. All the resources of the forest reserves are for use, and this use must be brought about in a thoroughly prompt and busi- ness-like manner, under such restrictions only as will insure the permanence of these resources.59 Beyond the question of the forest, Pinchot's more general conservation philosophy encompassed similar goals. He aimed to develop America's natural resources and use them to the fullest extent, to prevent resource waste, and to preserve the country's Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="12">364 David N. Livingstone natural assets for the benefit of the many, not the profit of the few: Conservation means the greatest good to the greatest number for the longest time.'60 Throughout we find solid utilitarianism. It was thus a conservationist ethic, based on wise-use utili- ty, imbued with socialist sentiments, and radically different from the pietistic preser- vationism of the romantics. Nowhere, perhaps, did the divergence between conservationist and preservationist convictions, between utility and piety, surface more dramatically than in the con- frontation between John Muir and Pinchot over Hetch Hetchy valley in the High Sierras in 1912-13. For while Pinchot gave his support to those who wanted the valley flooded to serve as a reservoir for San Francisco; Muir vehemently denounced the whole project as temple destruction and vulgar commercialism.61 A similar commitment to the principles of scientific management had undergird- ed the environmental thinking of one of Pinchoťs chief sources of inspiration, John Wesley Powell.62 A geologist, ethnologist, and veteran of the Battle of Shiloh, where he lost an arm, Powell became the Director of the USGS and engaged in a number of key Western expeditions, the most celebrated of which was his trip down the Colorado River. These experiences sensitized Powell to the misconceptions that many held about the western interior (such as the image of the Great American Desert) and the real problems of subhumid environments. With the end of the Civil War many began to look westward, and the Homestead Act enabled settlers to acquire lands of 160 acres very cheaply. Powell, however, realized that, on these, many people ended up as the victims of drought, speculative operators, blizzards, or grasshoppers. What was needed were smaller holdings and an irrigation system to the east of the hundredth meridian; but beyond very much larger grazing farms, in excess of 2,500 acres were needed. These ideas - too radical for the time - were set out in his famous Report on the lands of the and region of the west in 1878, through which he hoped to undermine the activities of land speculators by requiring evidence of set- tlement. While he met with political defeat, he did lay some of the foundations for the American conservation movement. In recent times this utilitarian trajectory has continued to find a voice amongst advocates of sustainable development. The concern here lies less with ethics and esthetics than with economics and resources, and has found expression in such key documents as the World conservation strategy of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (1980), Lester Brown's Building a sustainable society (1981), and in the Bruntland report, Our common future (1987). In large measure these are both progressive in spirit and conservative in impulse, and have thus drawn criticism from those who feel that their appeal lies in their 'international political acceptabili- ty', and that their functionalism treats nature as 4 nothing more than a pool of "resources" to be exploited'.63 1 do not intend to adjudicate on such evaluations. My purpose is different: to advert to the perpetuation of utilitarian values within the environmental conversation. Community Thus far I have contended that, while one strand of the environmental movement finds its animus in the fostering of piety, another sees utility as its dominating social value. I have suggested that these values, in turn, reflect differences between organic Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="13">The polity of nature: representation, virtue, strategy 365 and mechanistic ways of conceiving the natural order. Now I want to propose that conversing about nature in the language of political economy induces a reliance on a third value which has been seized upon by as crucially significant: community.64 Nowhere, perhaps, is this more clearly discernible than in the 'land ethic' champi- oned by Aldo Leopold. This seminal statement, although amounting to a mere 25 pages at the end of his A Sand Courtly almanac , published in 1949, resulted in his being described as the 'Moses of the new conservation impulse'. 65 Its persistent theme was disenchantment with an overly managed world. Thus, despite the early influence of Pinchot, Leopold went far beyond the utilitarianism of his mentor as he came to appreciate what he called 'the complexity of the land organism'. This led him to reject anthropocentric values; the idea of 'good' and 'bad' species was to be discarded; language of usefulness, ugliness, cruelty as typifying species had to be jetti- soned: 'when we attempt to say that an animal is "useful", "ugly" or "cruel", we are failing to see it as part of the land. We do not make the same error of calling a carbu- retor "greedy". We see it as part of a functioning motor.'66 Although early in his career Leopold spoke of 'conservation as a moral issue' and adopted the language of the new ecology - food chains, energy flows, ecological nich- es, and so on - it was his discovery of the importance of community that was to be most influential. He was now convinced that a strictly econometric posture towards nature actually created ecological and ethical problems. These convictions formed the groundwork for that final chapter of Sand county , 'The land ethic', the objective of which was to help the land 'survive the impact of mechanized man'. It was, he insist- ed, only 'When we see land as a community to which we belong, [that] we may begin to use it with love and respect'. As it was, he wrote, 'Conservation is getting nowhere because it is incompatible with our Abrahamie concept of land. We abuse land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us.' Implicit here was the idea of biotic rights, for the central place in his scheme was the 'biotic community'. As he himself put it; 'All ethics so far evolved rest upon a single premise: that the individual is a member of a community of interdependent parts . . . The land ethic simply enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants and ani- mals, or collectively: the land.' Accordingly the land-ethic embraced the principle that a land-use decision 'is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.'67 Such an ethic could not be fostered by legislation. What was needed was an inter- nal change of values, a change of community loyalties and affections; and it was pre- cisely these 'foundations of conduct', as he labelled them, that the conservation movement of his own day had signally failed to provide. Anthropocentric economics could not, and must not, be allowed to dictate ethics. Social economy must mimic the polity of nature, not the reverse. Of course, most ecologists after the Second World War simply rejected Leopold's strictures as the new discipline became abstract, quan- titative, and reductionist. Crop yields and mathematical modelling - not ethics - set the research agenda. Still, there were other voices beginning to be heard, and chief among these was that of Rachel Carson. Along with Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's cabin , which extended American ethics to blacks, Carson's Silent spring (1969) enlarged the idea of rights, this time to encompass the non-human realm. The book was dedicated to the 1952 winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Albert Schweitzer. Schweitzer had lived in Africa for many years, Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="14">366 David N. Livingstone where he came to believe that the basis for ethics must be what he called 'reverence for life'. And reverence for life did not stop with human beings: Schweitzer applied the principle to all matter. The human species was only part of a vastly larger commu- nity of creation. Such ideals were eventually to find expression in the writings of Carson. The literary genre she best exploited was the natural history essay, of which Silent spring is only the best known.68 It appeared just two years before her death, first as a series of pieces in the New Yorker and later that year as a book. Her concern was with insecticides, herbicides, and in particular DDT. Because she believed a creature is only a 'pesť when evaluated from the human perspective, she dubbed insecticides 'biocides', namely, killers of life. Her book forecast a time when these instruments of destruction would have been so effective that the whole ecosystem would be infected and there would be no more birdsong. Written in anger and with reformist aggres- siveness, it dramatically exploited the age-old tactic of shock - a strategy that both- ered a number of critics like John Maddox, a theoretical physicist, who accused her of misleading readers with 'horror stories about the misuse of DDT to create an impression that there are no safe uses worth considering'69 But the book's message was crystal-clear and drew sustenance from Schweitzer's philosophy. The 4 'control of nature"', she wrote, 'is a phrase conceived in arrogance, born of the Neanderthal age of biology and philosophy, when it was supposed that nature exists for the conve- nience of man.'70 These writings, I suggest, are founded on the belief that the natural order consti- tutes a complex biotic community, an integrated ecosocial economy in which the human and non-human are intimately interconnected. The health of this community is seen as the highest environmental value. Community, not piety or utility, is the key virtue. Environmental strategy I have argued so far that significant links exist between representations of nature and environmental values. Conceiving of the natural order in organic terms, I have sug- gested, tends to invoke environmental piety; mechanical images, by contrast, encour- age utility - albeit of the wise-use sort; and talk of nature's economy has frequendy underlain the thinking of those with strong community values. These coalitions, of course, are just that - loose associations, not direct links. The same is true of three specific strategies to which I now turn, that have been employed to meet environ- mental challenges. My contention is that these political strategies are expressions of different environmental values which are themselves reflective of diverse representa- tions of nature. Nature mysticism : reverencing the rural Amongst the intellectual élite of early twentieth-century Britain there developed a sense of a lost folk heritage that needed to be recovered, a sense that the English peasant class had a special mission in preserving past values.71 Many linked physical and moral welfare with rural life, and so in 1926 the Rural Reconstruction Association came into being, for the purpose of restoring 'agriculture to its rightful Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="15">The polity of nature: representation, virtue, strategy 367 THIS*OTHER*EDEN SI cip Ig a 1 i i a I 1 R E i I i a M p i 1 THIS*ENGLAND Figure 1 ~ CPRE logo. place in our national life'.72 During that same year, the Council for the Preservation of Rural England (CPRE) was formed, with the aim of co-ordinating the activities of local amenity groups and encouraging their campaigns for sound environmental policies in plan- ning. In order to see something of the source of this movement's inspiration, we may focus on one of its ardent supporters, the geographer Vaughan Cornish, whose 1932 book, The scenery of England : a study of harmonious grouping in - town and country , was published by the CPRE. On the front cover was print- ed the council's logo - an arcadian appeal to rustic reverence. The Council's president provided the foreword, and observed that Cornish had performed a great service by providing 'a philosophical basis for the aesthetics of scenery, built upon the ultimate foundation of our geology and geography'.73 In fact that philosophical basis was quarried from the Wordsworthian mysticism to which I have already alluded.74 Cornish, as it turns out, was a mystic, and his activism for countryside preservation was grounded in an enthusiasm for aspects of Eastern reli- gion. This, moreover, linked with his eugenic interests, his advocacy of ancient folk ways, and a sense of continuity with Aryan traditions.75 Such sentiments are especially evident in his treatment of Stonehenge and Salisbury Plain in The Scenery of England, in which he spoke of the stones and their surrounding green turf as 'a circular tem- ple'. Towards the end of his exposition - in which he recounted several visits to the site - he observed: 'I have dreamed that there were men of vision in those ancient days and that by transmigration of the soul backward in the stream of time I stood with them at worship in the Courts of Stonehenge.'76 For Cornish, then, the CPRE became the institutional forum through which ancient nature mysticism might be recovered. If the wisdom of rural reverence could be retrieved, the depredations of industrial modernism could be stemmed and national spiritual recovery effected. Engineering science : managing nature The English ecologist Arthur G. Tansley (1871-1955) had little time for such roman- tic talk; indeed, he came to believe that the ideas about biological communities expounded by figures like Clements were far too anthropomorphic. Tansley's back- ground was in physical science - reducing nature to chemistry and energy - and he was interested in modelling energy flows through living things according to the laws of physics. Thus he proposed in 1935 replacing the term 'community' with 'ecosys- tem'. Thereby, having earlier been an acolyte of Clements, he established himself as a leading critic of Clementsian theory, and repudiated the modish holism being parad- ed by the South African statesman J. C. Smuts, who, in Holism and evolution (1926), urged that natural wholes possess self-realizing powers. Tansley's environmental activities, moreover, cannot be understood in isolation from his professional aspirations for ecology as a science, or from his concern to move the subject away from biological modes of thinking to physical analyses.78 In the mid-1 930s, we should note, organicism was widely considered socialist in tone Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="16">368 David N. Livingstone because, in opposition to individualism and competitiveness, it viewed society in a corporatist way. Tansley, by contrast, subscribed to a hierarchical view of social class and race, and believed that these were ineffaceable stratifications.79 Indeed, even in the early days, when he endorsed Clements's organicism, Tansley's enthusiam for Freudian psychoanalysis and his belief that the Darwinian features of plant communi- ties paralleled 'the nations, tribes, and societies of mankind', justifies Tobey in the claim that Tansley's involvement with nature conservation reflected the views of a 80 man within the establishment. Primarily concerned to save sufficient amounts of nature from the ravages of urbanism and industrialism in order to provide adequate samples of wild plant and animal life for ecological research, Tansley played a crucial role in the Nature Conservancy. To be sure, he was also convinced, as were the rural reconstructionists, that English character and culture were bound up with landscape, and that to pre- serve the land was to preserve national identity. Thus his book on The Bńtish Islands and their vegetation (1939) was considered to have great cultural value even if it had no practical application. But for all that, Tansley's leadership of the Nature Conservancy movement was as one of Britain's scientific élite. The Nature Conservancy had come into being in 1949 as an independent institution, to support ecological research and to provide advice on natural flora and fauna. Its inception indicated that the ecologists had succeeded in presenting nature conservation as the responsibility of government - a state of affairs they had sought to achieve for many years. To do so they had made strenuous efforts to demonstrate the practical utility of sound ecological research; Tansley's own book, Aims and methods in the study of vegetation, published in the mid-1920s, revealed how ecology could be applied by foresters and agriculturalists throughout the Empire. To be sure, Tansley and his associates were fundamentally interested in determining the carnes of ecological patterns, and had no desire to abandon 'pure' research. But when practicality was called for they presented themselves as the ideal scientific 'managers' of environment, the engineers of nature. If in so doing they could obtain for themselves a secure foundation for ecology, so much the better. An institution that was technically independent from the practical questions of land management was what they wanted, and the Nature Conservancy was the outcome. This enabled the ecologists to pursue ecological research, to provide expert advice on policy when consulted, but to remain free from direct governmental direction.81 Thus the development of the Nature Conservancy was intimately connected with the ambition to create an independent science of ecology, and when its advice was sought on conservation matters its approach reflected its scientific ethos. The strategy was that of the environmental engineer, not the nature mystic. Political ideology : shades of green If some turn to nature mysticism and others to modern science as the solution to the environmental crisis, still others have become convinced of the need for direct politi- cal involvement. John Passmore, for example, believes that 'the principal obstacles to the solution of ecological problems are in fact political, to persuade or coerce citi- zens into action'.82 Just precisely what this might amount to, of course, is far from clear; a variety of options have been proposed, or indeed operationalized. Consider, Ecumene 1995 2(4)</page><page sequence="17">The polity of nature: representation, virtue, strategy 369 for instance, the slender volume entitled A blueprint for survival, published in 1972 by the editors of the journal The Ecologist. It forecast profound social disruption - an inevitable 'breakdown of society' - if population growth, pesticide and fertilizer use, and the production of domestic and industrial waste continued unchecked. Besides its 'scientific' diagnoses - and its prescriptions were endorsed by thirty-four distin- guished biologists, ecologists, medical doctors, and economists - it also incorporated a call for radical social reform. It devoted considerable space to 'Creating a new social system', to be based around small communities: a sort of quasi-Arcadianism. The destruction of large-scale urban life would be welcomed; the authors tried to convince readers that it was only in small communities that people could truly become individuals. For them, to speak of an ecological problem and its 'solution' was to be committed to certain ioaa/judgements. Their programme for the next cen- tury thus involved the transformation of education towards life in the new stable soci- ety, the establishment of a national population service, grants for the use of organic fertilizers, the decentralization of industry, the end of road-building and the develop- ment of rapid mass-transit systems, and so on. Ecological issues were thereby seen to be profoundly social, perhaps more so than scientific. This reading, of course, is only one of many. But since most of these articulate in one way or another leftist theses - ecosocialism of various stripes83 - I think it will be instructive finally to reflect on the way in which environmentalism was connected up to the forces of conservatism in early twentieth-century Germany. Some, indeed, have suggested that ecologism was a German disease!84 Here, it is said, there developed a philosophy that abolished the traditional difference between nature and culture - a system that naturalized or, perhaps better, biologized culture. When this was coupled with a German sense of uncertainty about national identity, and the shifting political and territorial boundaries of the nation, there developed a search for a more 'authentic' earth-bound identity. Alongside these concerns, and perhaps overshadow- ing them, was disquiet over human health: anxiety about water quality and associated outbreaks of cholera fostered the establishment of a variety of organizations focusing on social hygiene and the reform of urban planning, and promoting the ideology of anti-modernism. In 1913 the philosopher-psychologist Ludwig Klages issued a jeremi- ad about 'urbanization, vanishing species, and other environmental maladies', and argued that the 'predominance of economic utility and technological know-how' had fostered 'perverted values, alienated from Nature [that] had caused the current decay of the environment'.85 The 'soulless culture' as Dominick puts it, that was, according to Walter Schoenichen, 'born of jazz and urban asphalt', was seen as a major source of the despoliation of Germanic nature.86 All this represented a tradi- tion of conservative environmental concern that pre-dated German National Socialism but was diverted into the Third Reich: 'A strong nationalism combined with anti-modernism, anti-socialism and anti-capitalism became characteristic of this conservative-conservationist current. ' 87 Within this tradition were those who advocated a radical nature cult which insisted that close ties between people and nature needed to be re-established in order that the false, life-suppressing ethic of modern urban living might be obliterated. 'Blood and soil', a phrase that came into currency in the early 1920s, captured the spirit of peasant kinship with the land; the peasant was the life-blood of the nation and was also its spiritual and cultural strength. Without soil, there was no identity. Here was a Ecumene 1995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="18">370 David N. Livingstone human ecologism - a biosocial communitarianism - of the most practical political sort. By the end of the First World War and the Nazi takeover, the era of the peasant community had been inaugurated. The idea was that the peasant had a special oblig- ation to rescue the world. Rudolf Steiner, for example, called for agricultural self-suf- ficiency, in order to preserve the 'spirit of the soil'; fields were to be tilled in accordance with the life-forces of the cosmos. Balanced between industrial capitalism and agrarian romanticism, the conservative lauding of peasant life was designed to keep the economy of nature and the economy of society in harmonious balance. But this was hardly an egalitarian balance: the economies of nature and of society were taken to be 'naturally' hierarchical, and only by maintaining such primal struc- tures could the natural community and the national community alike be preserved. For nearly half a century this had been a recurrent theme. Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl, for example, had insisted that 'a healthy society needed a healthy hierarchical struc- ture', and therefore believed that 'rooting out the forests really meant rooting out tradition, and levelling the mountains meant levelling social hierarchies'.88 All this is a far cry from the organicism of the deep ecologists; for those ecologists smitten with Völkisch sentiments, as Dominick tellingly puts it, 'Nature had value only as a source of vigor for Germany's national soul'.8 As the German League for the Protection of the Homeland had already made clear in its founding manifesto of 1904, the mainte- nance of 'Germanic nationality undamaged and untainted' was inseparable from 'the protection from further defamation of the Germaņ homeland with its monuments and the poetry of its Nature'.90 Thus artificial fertilizers were rejected because they were alien to the land. And if the future lay with the peasants, it was thus understand- able why Nazi plans to create a rural Germany depended on installing a new peasant nobility to replace the old one. The creation of a strong, self-reliant class of yeoman peasantry was seen as the panacea for economic and moral ills. The Nazi ecological agenda was thus a racial one as well: As Otto Großjahn, a key proponent of Naturschutz [lit. 'the defence of Nature'], put it in 1927: 'the protection of Nature is the touchstone of the heart of the Volk.'91 The nationalistic twist which Völkisch propagandists gave to their conception of community, and their linking of Germanic conservatism to nature conservation, rep- resent a particularly pernicious politicization of environmentalism. I merely instance this dark moment to illustrate just how powerful an influence a politics of nature can exert. Conclusion The intellectual and behavioural trajectories I have sought to elucidate offer some preliminary hints about how representations/conceptions, virtues/values, and strate- gies/practices might be interrelated. These are only loose coalitions of themes; they are not intended as historical models.92 Rather, they highlight dominant trends of thought, ethical orientations, and strategic options.93 The very concept of environmental problems presupposes some normative state of nature. To speak of an ecological problem is to make an ethical judgement that soci- ety would be better off without it. For this reason the environmental debate is fre- quently, at base, a debate about what constitutes the good life.94 Indeed, the very labels environmentalists use are frequently moral categories. To describe something Ecumene 1 995 2 (4)</page><page sequence="19">The polity of nature: representation, virtue, strategy 371 as being polluted, for example, is to make both a physical and a moral evaluation. In an important sense ecological problems are social constructions, and to understand them requires elucidating social circumstance. We therefore must resist the view, says Passmore, 'that we can solve our ecological problems only with the help of more sci- ence and technology'. Their resolution, in fact, requires 'the solution of a sub-set of problems - scientific, technological, economic, moral, political, administrative - each with its own style of résolution'.95 At the end of his significantly entitled collection of essays on the The wealth of nature , Donald Worster makes a similar plea: The environ- mental crisis is making the modern mind obsolete. It demands a new economics, a new science, a new world-view to replace materialism. But where is the new Adam Smith who will help reveal the direction in which we ought to fly?'96 Throughout this paper I have argued that the sciences of nature and environment never simply represent the objects of their inquiry in a way that is unadulterated by social, moral, cultural, economic, or political concerns. Rather, the knowledges they deliver are to a considerable degree socially constructed interpretations of the real world, for the simple reason that there is, as Neil Evernden has recently put it, 'an inherent volatility [in] the concept of nature and [in] the ways in which that concept is used socially'. Of course this does not mean that environmental science presents us with nothing but social fictions dressed up in scientific jargon: nature certainly sets limits on what we can say about it. Nor does it mean that we can play fast and loose with the environment, as though all talk of environmental degradation is mere myth- making. As Elizabeth Bird has recently written: We need histories of environmental problems that examine the social relations, structural conditions, cultural myths, metaphors, and ethical presuppositions that constitute the social negotiations with nature that contribute to these problems. . . . What we should learn from these studies are the principles of social interaction with nature that will most likely prevent the recurrence of significant environmental degradation. What are the appropriate social expectations of nature? What are the stories we should tell? What are the ethics that should guide our negotiations?98 These are questions, I believe, that should remain high on our cultural and scientific agenda.

Denis Cosgrove has made the interesting observation to me that there is a crucial distinc- tion between these two metaphors of divine operation, a distinction 'of vital social signifi- cance historically, speaking as it does of the rise of a new class (the mechanicals) to professional status'. Letter, 15 Sept. 1994. Cosgrove also argues that, in the sixteenth-centu- ry Italian context, the mechanical was not conceived of as anti-organic. See Denis Cosgrove, The Palladian landscape: geographical change and its cultural representations in sixteenth-century Italy (Leicester, Leicester University Press, 1993), pp. 216-17, 226-31. 1 This tradition is surveyed in Robin Attfield, The ethics of environmental concern (Oxford, Basil Blackwell, 1983), ch. 3, 'The tradition of stewardship'.

Frequently the connections between the economic order of nature and society were predicated on a providential design; see the dis- cussions in Jacob Viner, The role of providence in the social order : an essay in intellectual history (Princeton, N.J, Princeton University Press, 1972). On the history of the idea that there should be a mimetic relationship between the natural and social orders, see Nicholas Xenos, 'The natural politics of nation and economy', in Stipe Grgas and Svend Erik Larsen (eds), The construction of nature : a discursive strategy in modern European thought (Odense, Odense University Press, 1994), pp. 182-92. 34 William Coleman, 'Evolution into ecology?

Tobey, Saving the prairies: the life cycle of the founding school of American plant ecology , 1895-1955 (Berkeley, University of California Press, 1981). 38 Such concepts as invasion, association, and segregation were regarded as crucial.

Gregg Mitman provides an outstanding analysis of what I would call the 'political economy of animal and human ecology' in The state of nature: ecology , community , and American social thought, 1900-1950 (Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1992). These links between biotic and sociological communities also came through in geography. See e.g. W. B. Morgan and R. P. Moss, 'Geography and ecology: the concept of the community and its relationship to envi- ronment', Annals of the Association of Ameńcan Geographers SS (1965), pp. 339-50. 41 There are other ways of appro^hing this subject, of course. Goodin, for example, locates specifically 'green values' in a broader taxonomy of theories of value, and itemizes a range of value sources and diagnostic commitments. See Robert E. Goodin, Green political theory (Cambridge, Polity Press, 1992). See also Andrew Brennan, Thinking about nature: an investi- gation of nature , value and ecology (London, Routledge, 1988).

Evernden makes the suggestive comment that those who speak of ecological communities frequently neglect to 'mention other terms which share this joint societal/ecological usage, terms like competition, exclusion, exploitation and survival. Such words are less likely to be seized upon by those aspiring to establish the groundwork for an ecological ethic or an environmentally benign lifestyle, yet they are every bit as much a part of ecology'.

O'Riordan, for example, discriminates four possi- ble political strategies: a new global order which emphasizes the international character of the problem; centralized authoritarianism, which relies on government coercion; the authoritarian commune, which stresses devolved though still hierarchical social structures; and anarchism, which adopts a more egalitarian and participatory stance.
