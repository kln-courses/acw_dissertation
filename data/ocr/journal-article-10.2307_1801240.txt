Another result *YaS that the people, instead of working hard in their boats, sat with their hands in their pockets, and so became demoralised. The interior of Newfoundland was rlot an aOricultural country. The fine agrictlltural land which was sometimes described was rocks and bog, and the timber scrub. l'}ae other day on board a steamer he met the special com- missioner of a London newspaper, who in his account said that in the interior the land was magnificent, and that any number of forttlnes could be made thfere; but the truth was that the laIlfl there was vert,- inferior. It can grow potatoes, oats, and aregetables, and help a fisherman to live, but it could not compete with Manitoba as an at,riculttlral distriet. Mr. HOLME said that thouth Labrador might not be in a perfectly satisfactory state with the Hudson's Bay Cornpany, it would be much worse without it. If it were not for the Company there would be neither law now order in the countly. It svas true that a government coult-house a sllip annuallfT went round the coast, btlt a court which only called in for about ten minutes in each year was not of much force. More than this, the Company took the place of Poor Guardians. There were thousands of cases in which the peolule would have stal ved if it had not been for the Hudson's Bay Company, which supplied them with food and other necetssaries, and kept them goinC without any possibility of ever beinffl paid for what they gave. The PRESIDENT, in proposinC a vote of thanks to Mr. Holme, said that Labrador was evidently not a hospitable country, or very inviting to Enalish travellers. The falls of the Grand River tnu3t be rery stupendous if they were of anythin lilxe tLAe lnagnitude that Mr. Holme had sllggested. He confessed he was somewhat sceptical on that point. Judging from the anercid observations given in the paper, he should say that Lalse NVaminikapou must be 700 or 800 feet above the sea, and the authority for 2240 feet as the hei(tht of the tableland was doubtful.

HAVING thus traced the grc)wth of our lnowledge of the earth's figure, of the art of navigation and the preparation of maps, I pass on to notice the parallel onward course of geographical discovery. In many other branches of science the successive steps by which our knowledge has been advanced bear little on the ultimate results arrived at, which are complete in themselves, and constitute a body of fact having no necessary relation to the persons by whom, or to the manner in which it was collected. But geography presents itself to us in a different light.

Ead Columbus, for instance, made his famous voyages under the flag of England instead of Spain, which seenls tc} have been at one time possible, it can hardly be doubted that the history of modern Europe would have been wholly different. The studv of geography, like that of astronomy, first took a definite shape in Greece. The earliest ;eographical conceptions were necessarily based on ideas of position in re]ation to the locality where the ancient geographers lived and wrote, and upon these the gradually increasing knowledS, of the civilised world was engrafted, and developed around the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea, where the Phenicians, the earliest of European navigators, had established the centre of their commerce, extending their soyages to the Red Sea and Persian Gulf on the east, and the coasts of BritaiIl on the west. Herodotus, writing 450 years before the Christian era, may be taken as the e:xponent of the earlier forlns of Greek geography. The junction of the Mediterranean with the Atlantic was then knowll; ideas of the North and WN=est of iEurope were vague; the form and position of the Caspian were failly ascertained; the descriptions of India did not extend beyond the Upper Indus; and the coasts of Asia seem to have been unknown bet ond tlle Persian Gulf. The circumnavigation of Africa was referred to, but it may be doubted whether this was more than mythical. Tt is a curious illus- tration of the result of absence of effective publication, that though Herodotus had a just general notion of the form of the Caspian, Ptolemy entirely misconceived it, and it was not recovered till within the last two hundred years. Aleanander's expedition, 330 B.C., passing through Asia Minor, Persia, and Bactria, reached the Indus, where his traces and those of his successors are still to be found, and the Greek names given to some of the great geographical features of the country he passed through, are still in use on our maps. Of the Greeks who accotal)anied him some went into India Proper; while Nearchus on his return folloved the coast from the Indus to the Persian Gulf, and ascended the Tigris beyond Baghdad. The successors of Alexander's captains in the Bactrian kingdom which they founded e2ztended their knowledge to Eastern India, and one of their envoys visited Palibothra, believed to be Patna, on the Lower Ganges. About the same time Carthage, originally a Phenician colonv, vfhich had become the most important maritime power in the Mediter- ranean, appears to have sent e2cpeditions along; the western coast of Africa, reaching perhaps to the Equator, while its ships also visited iEwrance and are said to have sailed round Britain. The trade between iE(rypt and the east was maintained from Berenice in the Red Sea, and other ports at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, of which Hormuz was the medieval representatilre, and through them the commerce with Europe was carried on,</page><page sequence="3">207 BEFORE THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, 1888. IJp to the Augustan age, the only additions to geography were obtainea through the Roman conquests in Western and Northern Europe. Irl the tima of Pliny, the coasts of Asia had hardly been de- scribed with certainty beyond the mouths of the Ganges, and only vague conceptions of China had been formed. These ideas had become more defined, and extended to the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Janta, Zby the time of Ptolemy, A.D. 150. Till the end of the twelfth century, the further progress of geogra- phical, like that of a11 other branches of knowled ,e, was very incon- siderable. Something was done by the Arab geographers in the early period of the growth of Mahommedan power, and something by Norwegian Vikings whose voyages estended to Iceland, Greenland, and eventually to the coasts of A7orth America. B&gt;ut in the thirteenth and followint, ce:llturies, when the civiTisation of Europe was becoming consolidated, the spirit of onterpriso mras gradually awakened. The fornwation of the po^rerful republics of Venice and Genot, and the spread of their cornmerce, under the stimulus ot many causes, of which the (:rusades may be reckoned as one of the most prominent, was followed by a development of maritime habits, knowledge, and enter- prise among the nations bordering the AIediterranean, whlch was destined to produce great resaalts. The institution of the orders of fiiars, the desire to spread Christianity, and the terror produced by the incursions of Jenghis Shan into Eastern Europe? were followed by journeys, of which one of the lllOSt remarkable was that of the monk Rubruquis, 1253 A.D., into Central Asia. The growth of commercial activity sent forth the Polos, 126S, on similar expeditions, which extended to Mongolia and China. The friar Odoric, 1320, visited Persia, Western India, Sumatra, and Java, as well as China, returning by Tibet, and being the first Euro- pean to reach Lhassa. Thence he travelled by Cabul and Tabriz to Tenicc. His accounts are unqllestionabl) the basis of much that is found ill Sir J. Mandeville's travels, which there is much 1eason to think are mainla, if not whollyn fictitious. Arnong the travellers of this period should also be specially merktioned Ibe Batuta, an Arab of Tollgier, 1325-5a, who, after visit- z:ng iEgypt and Arabia, wen$ through Persia, Afghanistan, and India whence he was sellt by Mahomad Toghlak, therl kirlg of Delhi, Oll an embassy to Ghina. IIe travelled thither by sea down the west coast of India to the Maldives and Ceylon, and on through the Eastern Archipelacro to China. I3Dis journeys are reckoned to have extended over 7S,000 Ent,lish mlles. Thus, we are brought to the eve of that ,reat series of soyat,es wllich are the glory of the fifteenth and si2ateenth centuries, and among the most remarkable event.s recorded in history, opening out the way to :Eastern Asia roulld tlle Cape of Good EI:ope, and adding in the west a new continent to the inown world,</page><page sequence="4">208 LECTURES ON GEOGRAT'HY, DELIVERED The honour of takillg the initiative rests with the Portuguese. Soon after 141S, a course of maritime exploration was entered on, and con- tin.ued for many years under Prince Henry, which led to the successive discoveries of Madeira, the Azares, the Cape de ATerd Isles, and at length, 1484, extended along the west coast of Africa beyond the Equator. In 1486, King John sent out Diaz to endeavour to reach India by sea, the belief having become established that this could be done loy passing round the continent of Africa; but this expedition advanced little beyond the (:ape of Good Hope. Eleven years later, and two years after Columbus had retulned from his first soyage, Vasco da Gama, the largest of whose ships did not exceed 120 tons burden, doubled the Cape of Good Hope, and passing along the east coast of Africa to Mozambique and Mombasa, crossed the Arabian Sea and arrised on the western coast of India, near Calicllt, in 1498 A.D. Cabral in 1500, on his way to India by the same route, discovered the coast of Brazil. Many similar voyages followed, and iTl the course of the next few years the western and easterrl coasts of Africa, and the shores of the Arabian Sea were explored; the islands of St. Helena, Tristan da Cunha, Madagascar, Socotra, Bourbon, and Mauritius were made known; and the Portuguese under Albuquerque 31ad established theTnselves at numerous places along the coast of Arabia and India, making Goa the seat of their government. Their advance to Malacca immediately followed, and they explored Sumatra, Java, and the much coveted Spice Islands or Moluccas, their ships reaching China for the first time in 1514. Their settlements at Macao, near Canton, clate from 1537. Thus in less than fifty years from the discovery of the (:ape of Good Hope the Portuguese had opened out the whole of the coasts of Africa and Southeln Asia as far as China, as well as a laVrge part of the Eastern Archipelago. Almost simultaneously, Spain, adrenturers from which had already reached and occupied some of the Canary Isles, entered on a course of discovery and conquest still more remarkable. After the final triumph of Ferdinand over the Moors, the perseverance of Columbus was rewarded by the acceptance of his proposals to attempt to reach the Indies by sailing acros3 the Atlantic, in the hope of thus finding a sholter loute than that which the Portuguese were seeking round the continent of Africa. It was in 1492 A.D. that Columbus, guided by a truly scientific course of induction, for the first time so applied by any navigator, embarked on the first of the celebrated soyages which resulted in the discovery of what were at the outset supposed to be the eastern shores of Asia; an error largely due to mistaken reliance on Ptolemy's vastly exa^,gerated longitude of those shores, and on distances deduced from the itineraries of Marco Polo and other travellers. The settlements first made on the newly discovered islands, ever si:nce known as the West Indies, nere</page><page sequence="5">209 BEFORE THE UNINrERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, 1888. soon ez;tended to the neighbouring coasts of the narrow isthlnus between the gulfs of Darien and Panalua, and the discovery, by Nunez de Balboa, of the Pac;fic Ocean, followed in 1513. The accounts of this were tecei-ed with an interest little less keen than that lvhich had followed the discoveries of Columbus, indicating as it did the exist- ence of another great ocean still interveninO between tlze new con- tinent found by Colurnbus, and Eastern Asia. The exploration of the Gulf of Mexico, and the entry of Cortez into that collntry in 1a20, and its final conquest followed in rapid succession. In 1521 the filst advances were made along the shores of the Pacific; Peru was Srst seen in 1o26, Pizarro landed there in 1531, an(l the whole of that country and Chili were shortly added to the Spani6h kirlgdola. Meanwhile the discovery of Nurlez llad led to the despatch of the e2rpedition under Magellan, a Portuguese who had sailecl under Albu- querque, but had elltered the service of Spain in order to undertake the new enterprise of reaching the shores of Asia b- passing round tlle estremity of the new continent, and crossint, the lately discovered Pacific Ocean. This object he successfully carried out. The Stlaits called after WIagellan were passed in 1520, and filst the IJadrone Islands and then the Philippines were disco+ered, where hIagellan wa.s killed in a conilict with the natives. His companions, however, continued theil voya.t,e, and passint, thtough the Indian Archipelago, where the Poltu- g;uese had already established themselves, one of the ships, which alone survived, reached Spain again in 1522, having for the first time in the history of man accomplished thc circunmavigation of the globe. The enterprise of Spain thus completed that great work of malitilue discovery in which Portut,al took so llonollrable a share, and which in a period of less than fifty years had led to the acquisition of a knowledge of the distribution of the principal areas of land and sea in their main features. It was soon after the comluencement of this course of discovely, 1494, that an agreement was colue to by Spain and Portugal, and submitted to the Pope for his sanction, for tlle division between the two countries of the newly discovered parts of the world. A Bull was accord- ingly issued by Alexander VI., which declared that a line should be drawn from pole {o pole, across the globe, 100 leagues, afterwards e2ztended to 370 leagues, west of the Azores and Cape de Verd Islands, and that all newly discovered territolies to the east of this lille should full to the share of Portllt,al, all those to the west, to Spain. This arra:ngement determined the direction given to the w-oyages undertaken by the two countries. The line proposed is nearly on the 50th meridian nest of Greenwich, and the corresponding line ;n the other hemisphere ison the 130thmericlianeast. Its adoptionasaboundary served to confirm Portugal in its occupation of Brazil; but sub- yquently lecl to a conflict as to the right of Spain to the Philip-</page><page sequence="6">210 LECTURES ON GEOGRAPHY, DELIVERED pines and Moluccas which lie aloIlg the lSOth meridian. It is a singular circumstance that the Pope was ollce more reirred to, only a year or two ago, to arbitrato on ths occasion of a dispute with Germany as to the territorial rights of Spain over the Caroline Islands; and, if I znistake not, the Bull of Alexander was adduced as evidence i:n the discussion. iE3efore the end of the sixteenth century the exploration of the western shores of the North Atlantic as ir as the polar seas had beels completed by English and iFrench stlilors. The earliest English soyages of dis- covery are those of Cabot, believed to hare been a Venetian, who had settled at Bristol in the reign of Eenry VII. In 1494, swhen in search of a north-west passage to the IndieAs, ho reached Newfoundland, and his sons sailed along the AmericarL coast as far south as CEslorida, already known throughthe Spaniards- Later:Frobisher and Davis, 1576-1585J explored Labrador and the west coast of Greenland? alld entered ]3affin's Bay, so called after Baffin, who in 1616 pelletrated still further, and reached lat. 78? N., but ouly to find the way onward blocked with icey and impracticable. In the latter part of the same century the Spaniards sent several expeditions fronl Peru across the Pacific, still seeking the Philippines and far-famed Spice Islands, and for the first time visited various groups of islands in that ocean, the Marquesas, the Society Islands, and the New Hebrides. Drake, 1577, passing through Magellan Straits, extended his explorations up the western coast of America as far as Californiay and for the second time a.ccomplished the circumnavigation of the earth. So far as the grea.t geographical features of the globe are concerned, all that then rernained to be done was to define the position and extent of the continent of Australia, and this was rirtually accomplished by the Dutch in the next half century. The voiyages of the Dutch into the Eastern Seas began about the year 1600, and this enterprising nation by degrees displaced the Portuguese fronl their possessiolls in the Eastern Archipelago, establishing themselves in their place, and in this position they still remain. A Dutch expedition bound for the Eastern Isla:ads first deterlnined, 1616 the true es:tremity of tlle South American con- tirlent by rounding Cape Horn. The northern and parts of the westeso coasts of Australia were explored by the Dutch in 1627, alld in 1642 Tasman sailed round Australia, discovering Tan Diemen's La:nd, now called after him, believing it to be a portion of the mainland, as well as New Zealand, thence passing on through the Fij; and Solomon groups b;sr New Britain and round Nes Guinea. In 1606 Torres, a Spanish aornlnander, in a voyage from Peru, had already reached the :north-east angle of Australia, and passing through the straits since called after him, had sailed up the south-west coast of New Guinea, thus showing that the estre: ne north-eastern liinit of Australia had here been reached. It is worthy of notice that all the voyages across the Pacific wero directed almost along tlle same line, from the extreluity of South America</page><page sequence="7">211 BEFORE THE UNIVERSITY OF CA3IBRIDGE, 1888. towards New Guinea, doubtless with the object of reaching the Moluccas or Philippines, which, from a belief in the wealth there to be acquired by commerce and plunder, had become the centre of attraction of all classes of adventurers, whatever flag they fiew; and to this cause nlay be attributed the circumstance that the geography of Australia and the northern Pacific was not made known until a much later period. With the latter part of the seventeenth century we reach the period when a spirit of comluercial enterprisei had in a great degree replaced the old spirit of adventure and love of conquest, which had stimulated the earlier voyages of discovery. Concurrently with this change a great development of scientific knowledge had taken place, and expeditions, lnainly for purposes of scientific discovery and investigation, begall to be despatched to many distant or little known parts of the earth. Of the results of these it is only necessary to refer specificallyX first, to the discovery by Behring, in 1728, of the straits separating Asia from America, through which (:ook glso, fifty years later, after traarersing the Pacific from south to north, penetrated as far as lat. 70? 40' N., when he was stopped by ice; and, second, to the fact established by the last-named great navigator, that, whatever land there may be around the South Pole does not extend beyond the Antarctic cilele. A position had now been reached ill which the further progress of geograph:, chiefly required a more exact delineation of details, and the extensioIl into the interior of the great continents of the explorations which at first had to so considelable an e2ztent been confined to the sea- coasts. IrL this labour the services of France and England were rnost conspicuous until the commencement of the present century. As we approach the present time, there has been a gelleral co-operation anlong all civilised nations in the advancernent of geographical knowledge, and the scientifie value of the work done by explorers both by land and sea has become greater, as the full extent of the requirements of scientific investigation were more completely realiseds So thoroug;h has been the success with whicll these labours have been prosecuted that it would now be hardly possible to describe what is known of the earth, otherwise than by pointing to what is still unknown, and this might be sulYlmarised in a very few vvords. Besides the interior of Borneo and New Guinea, and the pOl'tiOll of Central Africa where Stanley is for the present mornent lost to view, no considerable part of the earth's surface is unexplored, with the excep- tion of the polar regions, which have till rlow proved inaccessible. The maps of the interior of Africa now supply trustworthy represen- tations of a vast system of rivers, lakes, and mountains, till recently wholly unknown to the civilised world, and what retnains to be done is little more than to fill in the details of well-ascertained large out- lines. Australia has beell crossed and recrossed in many directions. The darkness which so long enveloped CerLtral Asia has been entirely</page><page sequence="8">212 LECTURES ON GEOGRAPHY, DELIVERsED cleared away, and thotlgh parts of Tibet are et to be visited, the true nature of the central plaill lying between that country and Siberia is completely known. The geographical features of North America are little less perfectly mapped than those of Europe; but large parts of the interior of South America, rnuch of which is coxered by forest, are still unsurveyed. The southern border of the North Polar Sea and the very complicated system of islands and channels along the northern margin of the American continent' between Behring Strait and Green- land, have been precisely delineated, and the boundary of the same sea along Northern As;a has also been determinecl. The highest northern latitude reached is about 8312? N., that is within 500 miles of the Pole. The nearest approach to the South Pole has been in 78? 11' S., but the difficulties arisin^, from climate have till now stood in the way of any satisfactory survey of the land seen at somo few poi:nts in the Antarctic area. I have thus far traced in broad outlines the lnanner in which our present knowledge of the fom and luagnitude of the earth, and of the featurt s of its surface, has bee:L acquired in the course of many centuries by the mental and physical efforts of a long succession of remarkable men, to a few only of whom was it possil)le that I should make special reference. The part of my subject to wllich I shall nez;t asl our attention 7ill principally regard the operation on the in- organic constituents of the globe of the gteat physical forces, gravity, heat, and chemical affinity, which coutrol and determine its movements, form, and constitue:ats, and underlie the distribution of land and sea and all the corlditions of its surface. The figure of the earth, and its existing featules, have had their origin in a former state of the planet, during wllicll it has been sub- ject to the gradual changes that accompanied its cooling from a previously much higher temperature. The forces of natule which are still at wrork, includillg the nlost wonderful of all, life, have operated upon the gioioe while it thus passed through the stages which have led to what it now is; producing varied conditions of surfaee, froza which have alisen as direct consequences, diff^erences of cliluate, and corre- spondiny variations in the forms anci distribution of lixring creatures, -egetable and animal. Thus it is that while every palt of the earth has its own characteristics, the general system c)f nature is one and the same eveIywhere; the special characters of the seeral regions being due to the action of local features or conditions, which are no sooner called into existence than they in ttlrn become secondary efficient causes of the. infinitely varied phenoluena that our g;lobe presents to us. In this manner has been evolved the ice of nature as we now see it; nature, which working with never-varying forces, appears to man in the present as his type of stability, wllilst it is constantly leading, through ever-varying forres, frozn the hidden shapes of an impenetrable past to those of an unknown future.</page><page sequence="9">213 BEFORE THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, 1888. The inflvlence of the movements and figure of the earth may earery- svhere be traced among the pllenomena brought to our knowledge by the mole and more complete exploration of its surface. The daily aSnd annual motions of the globe, subject to the eSects of the spherical form of the earth and the direction of its axis of rotation, determine at all part3 of its surface the amount of heat and light received from the sun, and thus regulate all the conditions of existence upon it; they give rise to the varying length of dat s ancl of seasons at different places, and to a multitude of recurring phenomena whicll characterise or influence the aninzate and inanimate world. In wha.tever direction we turn are to be found alternations of what may be termed terrestrial work and rest; day and night, suminer and winter, periodical winds extending over longer or shorter periods, seasons of rain and dry weather. The tides of the ocean, and the less apparent, though not less regular, periodical oscillations of the atmosphere, aswell as tlle little understood variations in terrestrial magnetisrn, are consequences of the same general causes. All nature, indeed, is subject to tllem. Under their contrc)l the ocean currents flow, the rivers rise and fall, the fields yield their harvests, tlle mountains are covered with snow, the ;dorets of the daisy close and open, and the lark and nightingale pour forth their song; they regulate the miglations and hibernations of animals, the daily labours of man and beast, the llours of active life and sleep, the increase and decrease of disease and death. Though mally of the diurnal charlges thus observed would equally follow as consequences of the sun moGring round a stationary earth, yet it is not difficult to find direct evidence, which immediately appeals to the senses, of the rotation of the earth on its own asis. This is very eompletely supplied by what is knonvn as Foueault's experiinent, whieh is performeci by means of a pendulum eonsisting of a somewhat heary plummet attaehed to a long and slendel string, thieh therefore has a long period of oseillation, while the direetion of its motion, rwhen swung, is llot liable to disturbanee by torsion of tbe suspending string. If sueh a pendulurn be setin motion, with suitable preeautions, over a line drawIl on the earth's surface, it will be found that the direetion of oseillation gradually departs from that of the line over whieh it eolnmeneed, the divergenee beirlg eaused by the gradual ehange of the absolute direetion of the line, eonsequent on the revolution of the earth on its asis a change not eolnmunieated to the pendulum, whieh, being only eonneeted with the earth by means of the flexible string, eontinues to swing in the same direetion as that given to it when it was first set in luotion. The apparent angular motion of the pendulllm will be equal, but opposite in direetion, to the angular lnotion of the earth on its asis multiplied by the sine of the latitude of the plaee where the pendulum is swung; whieh at London would give an angular veloelty of 1? in about five minutes. This, with a pendulum that swung</page><page sequence="10">214 LECTURES ON GEOGRAPHY, DELIVERED through an arc of 10 feet, would produce an apparent displacement of about two inches in ten minutes, taking place from south, round by west, north, and east. The movements of the atmosphere and of the currents of the ocean supply evidence of the same truth, though in a less obvious manner. The air and water everywhere, when undisturbed, acquire the velocity of rotation of the earth, which is dependent on the latitude, being greatest at the equator, and diminishing gradually towards the poles.- The velocity thus acquired gilres an apparent eastward impulse to all air or ocean currents lnoving from the equator towards the poles, anci an apparent westward impulse to air and water moving the other way. This had long been recognised as the true cause of the directions of trade winds and monsoons. More recently the direction of the south-west and north-east gales that characterise our own coasts has been seen to be due to the same cause, called into operation by the passage over our islands of areas of low or high pressure, which, accord- ing as they give rise to currents of air from the south towards the north, or vice versa, produce winds with westerly or easterly tendencies. The revolving winds or cyclones, which are developed within the tropics in so intense a form, also carry with them a terrible testimony to the true direction of the earth's rotation on its asis from west to east. The remarkable force inherent in the globe, known as terrestrial magnetism, which gives a determinate direction t() a *eely suspended magnetic needle, and is of inestimable value to man, has long been the subject of observatioll and study. The general properties of the mag- netic needle were known and appiied to navigation by European sailors early in the eleventh century, but much earlier by the Chinese. The fact that the direction of the needle deariates frola the true north, SUch deviation being termed its variation or declination, was probably known before the time of Columbus; but to him is due the first record of the gradual change which takes p]ace in passin^, from one place to another, he having obser+red in his voyage across the Atlantic that the variation which had at first been easterly at length became westerly. At an early period also, 1a76, the dip of a properly balanced magnetic needle, or the inclination from the horizon at which it coines to rest, had been observed by Norman, an Englishman, as well as the fact that this an;le also varies with geographical position. The corlception that the earth itself is a magnet, and gives the needle its direction, is due to Gilbert, also an Englishman, about 1600 A.D. Halley, who, in 1676, had visited St. Helella to make astronomical observations, and in 1698 undertook a specialvoyage to study terrestrial magnetism, first put forward a corlsistent theory of the variation of the compass. His final conclusiolls, based upon his own observations and all available data derived from other llavigators, were published iIl</page><page sequence="11">BEFORE THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, I888. 215 1701; when he showed that the complicated moven}ents of the needle might be referred to the influence of four poles of ma ,netic force two in the vicinity of either pole of the earth- - a wiew which, with some qualifications, subsequent inlrestigation has confirmed. Halley's conclusiolls were derived from a comparatively small number of observations of the decl;nation and dip alone, measurements of the intensity of magnetic force not l:laving at that time been made. This force, too, is now k:llown to sary frorrl place to place. The more ample collection of facts relating to both intensity and direction since brought together fiom all parts of the earth, has led to somewhat modi- fied views as to the phenomena of terrestr;al anag:netism. It is now established that there are two magnetic poles, one in each hemisphere, at which the needle would point arertically upwards and downwards. Their position, svhich is nof coincident with the geographical poles, is found to have saried according to some yet unknown law IIL the year 1878 the northertl pole was in lat. 70? N., long. 96 W., and the southern in lat. 73T? S., long. 147l2? E. Between these poles, a line that has been termed the magnetie equator, where the needle assumes a horizontal position, is found to pass round the earth, following an unsymmetrical line which, in 1878, la;sJ almost wholly to the north of the terrestrial equator in the hemisphere east of Greenwich, and to the south of it in the western hemisphere. It further appears that the lnagnetic force is not evenly distributed on the earth, and that the points of Inasimum intensity do not coincide +vith either of the magnetic poles. In the northern hemisphere thexe are two foci of masimum force of unequal intensity, the most powerful lying at about lat. 52? N., long. 92? W., near the great American lakes, the weaker in lat. 65? N., long. 115? E., i:a Siberia.. For the southern hemisphere, the available data are far less numerous, and the deter- mination of the foci of force is less reliable. It is, however, belielred that here also there are two points of masimum, of nearly equal power, and not far removed from one another, one in lat. 65? S., long. 140? E., the other in lat. 50? S., long 120? E. The unit by which magnetic foree is measured has been assumede adopting English standards of sTeight and le:agth, to be that which would impart to a weight of one grain a velocity of one foot in one second o? time. On this scale the magnetic force, wh6re least, is found to be 6?0; the northern masima are 14A2 and 13 3 xespectively, a}ld each of the southern 15 * 2. The declination, or variation of the direction of the needle from the true meridian, is a consequence of these unequal forces operating upon it, the westerly or easterly tendency of the needle (as the case anay be) followring the geographical pOsitiO:rl of the place of observation in its relation to the several foci of force, with a general result of consider- able complexitr. Up to the sistieth parallel of latitude, notth or south,</page><page sequence="12">gld LECTUP.ES ON GEOGRAPHY, DELIN'ERRD the declination, mThether easterlyor lvesterlf, rarely exceeds 30O; and, speaking generalliy, it is easterly in the Pac;fic and westerly in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Near the poles, where t}e dip becomes higll, the directive force of the earth's lnagnetism becomes much reduced, and the magnetic needle becoules comparativelJ unleliable and of little use. As what is termed the north pole of a magnetic 1leedle or bar, attracts the south pole and repels the nortll pole of another needle, the mag- netism of the earth at the north pole should strictly speaking be called south polar, and vice vex^sa. To avoid confusion from this cause, the north and south poles of the needle are nonv frequently terrned the red and blue poles respectively. It may also be mentioned that maglletic declination is alnvays measured from the true north, beint, desclibed as positive when westerly, and neOative w:hen easterly. The nature and mode of operat;ssn of luagnetism, and the allied phenomena of electricity, continue to be subjects of speculation, no e2&gt;planation of them having yet been proposed such as that which lefers heat and light to the vibratisns of an elastic luedium. Our knowledge of the phenomena of terrestrial ma^,netism therefore still remains ill the empirical stage; they are, however, held to shonv that the eartil's magnetism is distributed through its mass, and that the magnetic force either wholly or mainly resides in the interior, and cannot be attributed to external influences, though it may be aCected by them. Whether, or :not, geographical faatures have any influence oll tlle distribution of this force is doubtful. Observation shows that a11 tlle elements of the earth's tnagnetism not ouly vary from place to place, but from time to time; the variations being in some cases periodical arld dependent on the tirne of the day ol the season of the year, and in others e:xtending, with no apparent tendency to periodicity, over considerable lengths of tirne. The gradual alteration of the declinatlon at London was first noticed in 1622, and the diurnal variations in 1722, in which year also the first attempt was made to measure the Ynagnetic force. The n:lanner in which these variations occur is still a matter of investi(ration, and their causes ara doubtful, but the diurnal and annual changes are probably comlected with changes of the temperature of the earth or its atmosphere, and may be influenced by gc-ographical conditions. The :non-periodical changes that have been lecordel are very large. For instance, the declination in England, having been 11? 1S' E. in 1580? became 24? 34' \v. ill 1820 and is now 18? 30' NV. The dip has changed from 719 o0' in 1576, to 743 42' in 1723, and again to about 674? at the present time. These variations have been attributed by some to changes going on in the condition of the interior of the earth, asld by others to external influences; but they continue to be among the most obscure of physical phenomena. Besides the variations above-mentioned, there also arise other irret,ular</page><page sequence="13">217 BEFORE THE UNlVERSlTY OF CAMBRIDGE, 1888. disturbanees of the indieations of the magnetie needle, of short duration, whieh are sometimes spoken of as magnetie storms. They oeeur with a frequeney whieh shows a tendeney to periodieity, diurnal or allnual, and often almost simultaneously at distant parts of the earthy with nearly identieal effects, and with a marked inerease in intensity with inerease of latitude. They likewise exhibit a period of inerease and deerease eoineiding with that observed in the sun- spot area, thus giving additional reason to eonneet them with modifiea- tions of the maglletie or eleetrie eondition of the earth or atmosphere arising in some manner from the aetion of the sun. The probable eon- neetion of these disturbanees with the electrieal eondition of the atmosphere is indieated by their frequent oeeurlenee silllultaneollsly with appearanees of the aurora, and with electrieal earth-eurrents. The frequent, if not eontiallous, display of the aurora in the vieinity of the magnetie poles, further suggests a relation between the electrieal and magnetie eonditions of the earth. The true nature of all these phenomena is however, still very imperfeetly aseertained. As the phenomena most direetly dependent on the form and move- ments of the earth beeame more eompletely known, and as the eon- eeptions arising from their study were more elearly developed, inquirfr nras naturally extended to the nature of the earth's solid erust, and to the forees by the aetion of whiell its surfaee reeeived its existing out- lines, elevations, and depressions. The seienee of geoloCy is the result3 and the relation of geography to this science is what we have next to consider. A very little observatiorl and thought threw discredit on the ancient cosmogonies, and showed that they failed to give any satisfactory solution of the problems submitted by the advance of knowledge. If the extravagant myths of Asiatic origin, which peopled the eartis millions of years ago with races of anthropomorphic demit,ods, and heroes descended from the sun and moon, could not bear the test of facts; neither have those traditions fared better which unveil the earth fully equipped with all the present forms of life and speciallfr prepared to be the dwelling-place of man, some few thousand years years ago. Precise observation has now supplied sat.isfactory proof that the earth's surface, with a11 that is on it, has been evolved through countless ages, by a process of constant change. T:hose features that at first sight appear lllOSt permanentn yet in detail undergo perpetual modification, under the operation of forces which are inherent in the materials of which the earth is made up, or are developed by its movements, and by its loss or gain of heat. Every mountain, how- ever lofty, is beint, thrown down; every rock, however hard, is being worn away; and every sea, however deep, is being filled up.

Though the oeean tears domrn the eliSs against whieh it beats, tlle earth takes its revenge by upheaving the ocean's bed. When we look back, ly the help of geologieal seienee, to the more remote past, through the epoehs preeeding our own, we find eomplete evidenee thaUt the globe has passed in sueeession through all infinitude of anterior states, by l:neans of sluall modifiea.tions e2ztending over a vast period of time, but not differing in essentials from those which we now see to be going on. There are still preserved to us the remains of land and rnarine plants and animals-which lived, produced other generations, and died possessed of organs proving that they were under the influence of the heat and light of the sun; indications of seas whose wa-es rose before the winds, breaking down cliffs, and forming beaches of boulders and pebbles; of tides and currents spreading out banks of sand and laud, on which are left the impress of the ripple of the water, of drops of rain and of the tracks of animals; of soleanoes pouring forth streams of lava; and a11 these appearances are precisely similar to those we observe at the plesent day as the result of forees which xve see actually in opelation. Every success;ve stage, as we recede in the past history of they earth, teaches the same lesson. The forces which are now at work, whether in dcg;rading the surface by the action of seas, rivers, or frosts, and in transporting its materials into the sea, or in reconstituting the land by the elevation of m(luntains, or by raising beds laid out ;11 the depth of the ocean, or in volcanic eruptions, are traced as having con- tinued in action frozn the earliest times. Pushing back our inquiries, we at last reach the point where the apparent cessation, or failure of evidence, of former terrestrial conditions such as now exist, requires us to consider the relation in which our planet stands to other bodies in celestial space; andn vast though the gulf be that separates us from these, sciance has been able to bridge it. By means of spectroscopic analysis? it has been established that the consti- tuent elelnents of the sun and other heavenly bodies are substantially the same as those of the earth. The examination of the meteorites which have fallen on the tarth frola the interplarletary spaces, shows that t.hey contain nothing; foreig;rl to the constituents of the earth. The inierellce seems logitimate, corroborated as it is by the rnanifest physical con- nection between the sun and the planetary bodies circlllating around it,</page><page sequence="15">219 BEFORE THE UNIVERSITY OF C.&amp;MBRIDGE, 1888. that the whole solar system is formed of the same kinds of matter, and ss subject to the same general physical laws. These conclusions further support the supposition that the earth and other planets have been formed by the aggregation of matter once diffused in space around the sun; that the first consequence of this aggregation was to develop intense heat in the consolidating masses; that the heat thus generated in the terrestrial sphere was subsequently lost by radiation; and that the surface at length cooled and became a solid crust, enclosing a nucleus of much higher teraperature. The heat of the interior of the globe inerea6es about 1? F. for ever- ro or 60 feet of depth below the surface. The surface appears to have now reached a temperature which is virtually fised, the gain of heat from the sun beillg just compensated by the loss from radiation into surrounding space. As the esterior gradually cooled, contractions rteces- sarily ensued, producing charlbe of form and dimensions; and to these, etino in coznbination with gravity, are, no doubt, largely due the greater irregularities of the earth's surface. The strains set up by these forces must have coutinued to cause movements for a vastly prolonged period, and are doubtless still in actiorL. But the irregularities of the surface constituto only a slnall part of the effects of internal heat on the earth, and mineralogy is the branch of science to which reference must be made, for a knonvledge of the luany simple and compound substances that have issued, under the operation of chemical forces, from the vast laboratory contained within the cooling crust of the once incandescent globe. The solid nucleus of the earth, with the ocean and the atmosphere, as we now find them, may be regarded as the products which have resulted after the globe, by cooling, had attained a condition of practical equilibrium, and after the more active process of aggregation had ceased, and the combination of its elements, under the requirenlents of the laws of affinity, into the various solid liquid, or gaseous matter3 found on or near the surface, had been completed; and it is not a little r&amp;markable that two residua1 collections of matter, as I may term them, the air and the sea, which constitute a mere film on the solid earth's surface, should esercise so pretiominant an infuence on terrestrial economy. During the passage of the globe to its present stato many wonderful changes mtlst have taken place. The ocean, after its condensation from a gaseous state into that of liquid, must have long continued in a state of ebullition, or bordering on it, surrounded by an atmosphere densely charged with watery vapour. Apart, however, from the movements in the solid crust of the earth caused by its gradual cooling and contraction, its early higher temperature hardly enters directly into any of the con- siderations that ar;se in counection with its preserlt climate; a:tld it must remain doubtful how long and to what extent those conditions of climato</page><page sequence="16">220 LECTURES 0N G?0GRAPHY, DELIVERED which interest us most, as having occurred during the period in whic13 the existence of liSe is indicated, have been aff^ected by such early higher temperature. In the absence of any direct means of ascertaining the condition of the earth's interior, aid has been sought from leathematical science, by nhich it has been established, that the thickness of the solid outer shell of the earth must be considerable; and that if the interior is in a Suid state at all, which is very doubtful, it must be covered by a great thickness (probably not less than seseral hundred miles) of solid, comparatively unyielding matter; and it is argued, with apparent force, that no passage can exist, by which molten matter, if there be any, could ascend from such depths to the surface. Recent speculation has consequently suggested that even volcanic phenomena luay be con- sequences of the heat developed by intense pressures set up ty the mechanical forces concerned in the movements of the cooling outer solid crust, and that they are not immecliate results of the very high tempera- ture which almost certainly still subsists at great depths in the earth's interior. A more probable explanation would seem to be that by some local ol partial removal of pressure in tEle otherwise solid interior, a portion of intensely heated matter is able to pass into the fluid state, and so finds a way through sorne fissure to the surface. It is still an open question among geologists, whether tlle exlulosions accompanying volcanic eruptions are due to gases generated in tne formation of the ejected lnelted matter, or to the sudden conversion of water into vapour in cavities containing sllch melted anatter; the latter view beinO supported by the facts that great volumes of steanl arc dis- charged by volcanoes during eruptions, and that the majority of active volcanoes are on islands, or if on continents, are near the sea.

I ne2ct pass to the consideration of its exterior, with which geography is mainly collcerned. In the ocean we see the waters of the earth accumulated, after their condensation, in pre-existing depressions of the solid surface. NVe find almost everywhere evidences of movements of the earth's solid crust on a very large scale, and of frequellt changes in the distribution of 1and and sea. The great continents include the areas that have last rise above the sea, and clusters of islands in mally cases appear to indicate the remains of former continents now disappearing. The graelual building up of the existing face of the earth can 1)e</page><page sequence="17">221 BEFORE THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, 1888. traced in the succession of deposits, often of vast thickness, collected around ancient land-surfaces; and indications are everywhere to be found of subsidences and elevations, though apparently without any altogether fundamental change in the great features or relative positions of the chief areas of land and sea, which seem to hare been preserved for rery long periods; so that we may not improbably still see relics of the earliest forms taken by the surface soon after it attained a solid condition. Movements such as these have continued till the latest geological times, and there is completo evidence that it was during this period that mountains among the highest in the world, the Himalaya and Alps, attained their present elevations. Iountain ranges, which are due either to pressllres arising from irregular contractions of the earth's crust, or to other internal forces capable of producing an upward thrust, occur in various forms. Frequently the areas of elevation with which zmountains are associated colrer very large tracts, and asSume the character of tablelands or plateaus, often broken up by minor mountain ranges or elevations} which frequently follow some determinate direction. In the larger mountain masses the valleys often appear to occupy lines of rupture or fissure determined by the tensions produced by the strains that gave rise to the elevation; and attempts have been made to explain the characteristic directions observed in the elementary portions of such mollntain masses, on mecllanical principles. In the case of areas of eleva- tion long as compared to their width, such as the iRimalaya and Tibet, the very constant combination of long ridges and valleys with shorter intervening transverse ruptures or connections, may be thus accounted for; and it has been arDued that radiating ridges and valleys ac- company a roughly circular area of elearation. That valleys are very frequently caused ;n great part, or wholly, by erosion, due to the action of surface drai:nage or ocearL currents, especially in unconsoli- dated deposits, is beyorld dispute, but even in such cases their origin often appears to have been in a fault or rupture of the strata through which they pass. The great masses of land which cover a large paX of the northern hemisphere are connected around the north pole, and send out divergi:n&lt;, ofEshoots towards the south; these, however, do not reach within 50 degrees of the south pole, with the exceptio:n of a small portion of South America. Generally spealing, the coasts of the continents rise steeply from ,reat ocearL depths, and very frequently high land occurs along or near their shores. In many cases the mourLtain-chains which bound or traverse the continents are of vast lineal es:tent, i:tldicating dislocatio:ns of the solid crust of the earth which reach over very great distances and to great depths, and their frequent parallel direction sug- gests a probable association in the causes and time of their production.

The superficial extent of many of these dislocations of the earth S crust is mot less remarkable than their lineal developnlent, and leads to sinlilar conclusions. Such were the movements that raised the tablelands of Asia Minor, Persia, and Afghanistan, and the great desert plateau of Gentral Asia, and above all, the vast protuberance of Tibet, and its coznponent gigantic moun- tain-chains, including the Himalaya. The high lands in both North arld South Alnerica supply evidence of the same nature. There was at first B9 little disinclination to accept theories which accounted for the observed facts of geology by the continued action through vast periods of tims of forces nor in operation. :13ut these olzjections have at length disappeared, and with them the school that explained the suedessive steps-which led to the great diXerences between the past and the present, by a series of catastrophes, or convulsions of ature, for which we have no authority in actual experience. Shotlld any still hesitate to believe that vast xnountains like the lIimalaya or the Andes and analogous depressions of the bed of the oceans can have been produced by a mere secular change of the earth's temperature, I would remind then that the forces called into action by the earth are proportionate to its magnitude, and that their e:ects must be on a corresponding scale. It has been calculated on sound data that the contraction of the diazneter of the earth, consequent on the fall of temperature from a fluid state to its present condition, has been about 190 miles. At this rate a subsidence of five miles, which is the appro:xi- mate greatest depth of the ocean, would correspond to a A11 of tem- perature of about 200? F. But the elevations and depressions of the earthis surface were probably produced by a comparatively much smaller loss of heat, and were due rather to tangential stlains tharl to direct upthrust or subsidence. ArL illustration may assist in forming a proper estimate of the irregularities of the earth's surface, which, though apparently great, are insignificant when viewed in relation to its actual dimensions. This hall might contaill a globe 40 feet in diameter. If this globe represented the earth lt would bo on a scale of 1 foot to about 200 miles; and 1 inch would be equivalent to a distance of 16 miles, or 88,000 feet On such a globe the difference between the polar and equatorial diameters would be less than 1 inch, and the greatest dovations irl Britain would be about 1;hc thickness of a threepenny-bit. The highest mountai:as and the deepest seas would be shown by elevations and depressions of hardly luore than one-third of an in?h; and if they were distributed as such features are on the earth, they would bs visible orlly with clifficulty, and to the naided ea&gt;res of a casual observer would hardly interfere witll the apparent perfect smootheess of the globe's surface.</page><page sequence="19">"23 BEFORE THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, 1888. The conception of the vast duration of geological time is one with which most persons are now more or less falniliar. It is well to re- member that great though the changes in human aSairs have been since the most remote epochs of which there are records in monuments or history, nothing indicates that within this period there has occurred any appreciable modification of the main olltlines of land and sea, or of the conditions of climate, or of the general characters of living creatures. The distance that separates us :Erom those days is as nothing wherl com- pared to the remoteness of past geological ages. No numerical estilnate on which reliance can be placed has yet been made of the duration even of that portion of geological time which is nearest to us; and we can say :no more than that the earth's past history, as recorded in what xve nonv find upon it, or as irLferred from what we find, probably extends over hundreds of thousands or millions of years. The duration of the successive ages of the earth's past existence is tneasured almost wholly by reference to the fossil remains of animals and plants included in the rocks of which the crust is composed. The like- ness of existing forms to those that characterise each gradually receding period constantly diminishes, and the more ancient shapes which con- nect the present with the several stages of the past, often, by their diffilsion, supply indications of the synchronism of deposits at distant places. Light is thus thrown, though it be an imperfect one, on the forluer distribution of land and sea, and on the existence of antecedent communications by land and sea between parts o? the earth now severed, or the converse. It is through the facts of geography as now acquired and in- terpreted, that the geologist is supplied with the means of arriving at the true signification of much that occurred in past time, the traces of which survive in physical features or organic forms. He iinds that the most important agencies in determining and modifying the present conditions of existence on the earth, whether as affecting inorganic nature or organic beings, are closely connected with the actual distribu- tion of land and sea, and the configuration of the surface; and he learns that it is through these agencies that he mllst seek to unravel the intricacies of the past. The study of geology, in its turn, enables the geographer to under- stand many tllings that would otherwise be unintelligible to him. IIe thus learns how the boundaries of 'sea and land have been determined; where connections formerly existing have been severed; how islands have risen from the ocean and luay be sinking below it; to what causes are due the rocky coasts and headlands, the indentations of the coasts, the formation of bays and fiords; at what time and by what means mountains have been raised up, ?lains laid out, valleJrs excavated, and the courses of rivers and positions of lakes fised; and he is taught the constituents and qualities of the materials forming R 2</page><page sequence="20">224 LECTURES ON GEOGRAPHY, DEL1VERED the sur:face of the earth, of tlle soil upon it, and of the minerals be- neath it And as a better insight is obtained irlto the natulal relations o5' the mollntains, the p]ains, the valleys, rivers, la!ses, and seas, the con- viction arises that the ever diversified details of the face of the .globe are in no sense accidents or fortuitous results, little worthy, as such, of admiration unless for their picturesque forms or wonderful proportions; but that they are the dilect, orderly, and necessary outcome of the action of forces simple in themselves, and operatint in accordance witl well-known and invariable physical and mechanic,al laws. The percep- tion of p;eneral c:haraoteristics of structure among the various features of the earth's surface, that pass under our review, is, indeed, too often over- shadowed and obscured by their magnitude7 bar the multitude of their details, and by the variety of their forms, which at first produce impressions of hopeless confusion; but, when once the idea of subordi- :nation to common laws is duly corlceived, it receives confirmation a.t every fresh step taken. The area of the dry land is very greatly e:xceeded by that which is covered with water. The whole surface of the earth being 197.1nillions of square sniles, about 55 millions are land, and 142 luillions water. The average height of the land above the sea-level is also very much less than the average depth of the sea-bottom below that level; so that a rear.rallgernent of the sllrface is quite possible by which the whole of the land might be submerged with comparatively little disturbance of the present level of the sea, or reduction of its averag;e depth. The highest measured peak of the Eimalaya, known as Alount Everest, which is also the highest in the world accurately determined, just rises 29,000 feet above the sea-lenel, but such elevations even as 1S,000 feet are, elsewhere, with the sole e2cception of parts of Tibet, confined to isolatecl peaks or sery narrow bands along the crests of a few of the hiahest mountain rang;es. Tlle area abovel 12,000 feet is about 2 per cent. of the wholeE land, and that above 6000 feet less than 9 per cent. From a careful computation recently made, it would appear that the mean height of the surface of the land above the sea-level is about 2250 feet; the continental areas llaving the following elevations: Ellrope, 939 feet; Asia, 3073 feet; North America, 1888 feet; South America, 2078 feet; Australia, 805 fef3t. The greatest depths measured in the ocean exceed 27,000 feet, and it has been estimated that the mean depth is about 12,500 feet. About 5 per cent. of the ocean area is less than 600 feet in depth, and a somewhat smaller proportion, more than 18,000 feet. About 17 per cent. is less than 3000 feet. The ocean bed generally appears to present very este:asive, comparatively nniform plateaus, varied only by moderate undulations, possiblfT to be attributed to contractions</page><page sequence="21">22S BEFORE THE UNIVERSlTY OF C.iMBRIDGE, 1888. of the earth's crust caused by cooling; these range in depth from 12,000 to 17,000 feet, and their general direction maintains a rough parallelism with that of the neighbouring continents. Submarine deposits derived from the land do not e2ztend beyond 300 or 400 miles from the shores; but at great depths deposits are being formed with extreme slowness, which are probably derived from decomposed organisms, or from coslnic, volcanic, or other matter, carried down through the water. Accepting these estilnates, it will appear that the volume of land above the sea-level is about -6th part only of the volume of the ocean. This relatively very small volume of land, and comparatively uniform great depth of the sea over very large areas, when considered in con- nection with the evidence that exists of the continuity of the earth's history within the range of geological time, strengthens the view, based on other considerations, that the! chief masses of land as we now find them have not greatly varied from their original position. Owing to the great depth of the sea, any upheaval of the sea-bottom, sufficient to form new land, would be likely to displace a solume of water greater than that of the new land, unless it were accompanied by an equivalent sub 6idence and increase of depth in some other locality. Failing this, such an upheaval would be followed by an encroachlnent of the sea on the land, which would necessarily lose an area corresponding, at all events approxi- Inately, with the volume of water displaced, and the area thus lost might easily be greater than that gained. VVith the latest additions made to our knowle(Rt,e of ths depth of the ocean there has also been acquired an altogether new series of facts bearing on its temperature, and its capacity for supportin^, life. The variations of heat and cold, due to change of season or to day and night, which affect the surface, descend to a comparatively small depth, being greatly reduced in the first 100 fathoms, and below that depth for the snost part eliminated, so that at 300 or 400 fathoms, an approsi- mately wIniforns temperature is met- lvith. Witll increased tempera- ture at the surface, there is increased evaporation, followed by greater density, by reason of which the surface water sinks, and the higher surface temperature is partially communicated to the subjacent strata. Further, it appears that though the surface temperature of the ocean lrarieS generally with latitude, reaching a maximum of 86?, or per- haps a few degrees higher, yet at the greatest depths, or say generally at 2000 fathoms (with an exception to be explained immediately), the-water has in all latitudes a nearly constant temperature but little above the freezing-point. This is lrlainly duet to the flow of glacial water from the Antarctic polar area towards the warmer equatorial regions, along the sea-oor, to which it sinks by reason of its greater density. The exception referred to occurs in the case of any area mrhich is cut off by an intervening shoal from communication with the</page><page sequence="22">226 LECTURES ON GEOGRAPHY, DELIVERED deep glacial waters. In such cases the bottom temt)erature i8 determined btr the mean winter temperature of the surface, unless the temperature of the external oceanic water at the level of the shoal be the lower of the two. Thus in the great basins of the Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Atlantic, wthich are of such a depth as to le in free communication with the Antarctic seas, the bottom temperature ranges from 32? F. to 36? F. In contrast with this, in the Mediterranean, which is cut of from the deep waters of the Atlantic by a shoal at a depth of about 200 fathoms, an effectual barrier is interposed to the entrance of water of a lower temperature than about 54? F.; and no losver temperature than 55? F., which corresponds to the mean winter tempera- ture of the surface, is found even at 2000 fathoms. In the Red Sea a silnilar result is observed, the bottoin temperature not falling below 71? F., at a depth of about 700 fathoms. From the mobility of water, and its lligh specific heat, which is almost four times that of the materials composing the land-surface, the sea-surface can never acquire a very high temperature. At the same tilYles the evaporation which is constantly going on from the whole surface of the ocean, leads to a large quantity of the heat it receives from the sun becoming latent, and powerfully aids in preventing an accurrlulation of hea.t. These Macts render the ocean one of the most important factors of terrestrial existence; it furnishes to the atmosphere tlae moisture which is one of the essentials of life, and serves by the circulation of its waters, and the difusion of sapour deriered from it, to equalise the temperature of the globe, by nloderating the extremes both of heat and cold. Hence the greater or less proximity of the sea directly aSects all conditions of climate. The circulation of the waters of the ocean, which is set up chiefly by the action of winds on the surface, but in part by variations of temperature and of density, and by the effects of evaporation, is con- trolled in all its details by geographical features. The trade-winds, which maintain over a large part of the ocean an almost constant current of air in a westward direction between the tropics, converging towards the equator, give rise to the great equatorial oceanic currents, lvhich, impinging on the eastern shores of the continents, are deflected to the north and south along them, and tend to establish systems of circulation in the several oceanic basins, north and south of the equator, and between the east and west shores of the continents between which they lie. In the northern hemisphere the movement is from south to north and east along the eastern shores, and from north to south and west along thel western shores; while in the southern the direction is the reverse, from north to south and east along the eastern shores, and from south to north and west along the western shores.

The nlost remarkable of the ocean currents is, without question, that along the east coast of North America, commonly spoken of as the Gulf-stream. It acqnires great persistency from a combinatioll of causes, which erlables it to carry a very high ternperature into the Arctic Circle to the nortll of Norsay, and most poxverfully to iniluence the climate of NVestern Europe, which hence oSers an astonishing contrast to that of the eastern coasts of the Atlantic in the same latitudes. Thus the isotherms of sea-surface temperature, from 75? F. to 40? F., on the American coast rarlge in the summer months between latitudes 35? and 50? N.; that is, over about 10? of latitudes or 700 miles. On the coasts of Europe and Africa the salue isotherms range between 20? and 70? N., or rather be;&gt;!ond these limits; that i8, over more than 50? of latitude, or 3500 miles. In the folmer case tllere is a change of temperature at the rato of one degree in 20 miles, in the other in 100 miles. There are luany other interesting peculiarities in the distribution of ocean temperature, to one of which I will refer. It is the occurrence of nalrow tracts vf relatively very cold water along certain parts of the west coasts of Africa and Alnerica, in close contiguity to areas presenting the normal temperature corresponding to the latitude. This peculiarity has been referred, with apparent reason, to the eSect of the prevailislg winds, which, blomrirlg from the east, drive the surface-water away fiom the coasts, where it is constantly replaced by the cold water which rises from below. How greatly local conditions of surface are able to aSect the opera- tion of the most far-reaching forces of nature is well illustrated by the tides of the ocean. The combined attraction of the sun anfl of the moon tends to produce a txvofold tidal wave in opposite hemispheres; the crests of these travel from east to west, or ill the opposite direction to that of tlle earth's rotatioll, succeeding one allother at intervals of 12 hours 24 minutes, half the period of the moon's revolution round the earth, and if undisturbed would follow the apparent place of the moon, the eSect of which luminary is about double that of the sun. This result is actually produced in the more open part of the ocean, chiefly in the more southern latitudes; but the distribution of the treat masses of land is such that elsewhere the progress of the tidal xvave in the llormal direction is not possible. In the Indian Ocean and the Northern Atlantic the principal tide is propagated fronl south to north, and, speaking gene- rally, in our own seas the tidal wave approaches tile west and south coasts, travelling from west to east, or in a diapetrically opposite direction to tllat of the force which generated it; while on the east coast it fows from north to south, entirely reversing the direction in which it passed</page><page sequence="24">228 LECTURES 0N GEOGRAPHY, DELIVERED up the Atlantic. In the open sea, as observed on small islands, the rise and fall of the tide is very little, amounting to one or two feet only; but the range is in some places more than forty feet, as in the Bristol Channel, at St. Malo on the French coast, and in the Bay of Fundy. These very high tides, as well as the strong currents which i some localities accompany the flow and ebb, are secondary.results due. to the g;radually contracting area or dim;nishing depth of the portion of the ocean in which the tidal wave is propagated, that wave orit,inati:ng in a movement of oscillation, not of translation. The great importance, for purposes of navigation, of a knowledge of the extent and periods of the rise and fall of the tide, which vary with the distance and apparent place of the rnoon, has directed the attention of mathematicians to the subject, and methods have been devised by which the dailJ times and heights of high and low water at any port may be calculated and predicted xvith ;reat precision, after a compara- tively short series of observations. It has been calculated that the forces of attraction which produce the tides of the ocean are sufficient to cause soz:ne deformation of the solid globe. The whole of the movements due to these forces being in a direction opposite to the earth's rotation, give rise to friction which leads to an extremely slow gradual reduction of the velocity of rotation. In formel conditions of the earth and moon, such as there is reason to think have occurred, the changes thus produted may have been very much more rapid, and their eXects may have had extremely important conseqtlences mrhen tha globe was in a semi-fluid state. It has been suggested, in connection with speculations of this nature, that the corru- gations of the cooling globe from which the ez:isting great masses of land and the ocean beds received their original forlns, may have been caused by the tide-producing; forces of attraction. The motioll of the tidal wave is so greatly interfered with by tlle land, that the velocity of its transmission is eventually reduced to that of &amp; free oscillating wave. This velocity, which depends on the deptl of the water in which it is propagated, possibly averat,ing 400 or 500 miles per hollr through the open seas, does not diSer materially fro that of the great seismic waves caused by the eruption of Erakatoa in 1883, as deduced from the numerous records obtained from various parts of the earth, including the coasts of France and England, to which the disturbances reached. Among the iniluences which give to the earth the characteristics that most immediately affect its fitness for occupation by man and the support of life generally, those due to the atmosphere are, without doubt! the most prominent. These, under the designation of climate, are con- stantly affecting us. But of all recognised branches of sciellce, that which treats of the atmosphere meteorology is at the present tme</page><page sequence="25">229 BEFORE THE UNIX'ERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, 1888. certainly the most backward. The reasons are not far to seek. The air is invisible, and in its upper regions inaccessible. The changes it under- goes are difficult to observe, and, from their great complexity, dificult-to grasp, while what we know of them is almost wholly confined to the immediate pro2zimity of the earth. It is pretty certain that the most important among the causes which operate on the atmosphere are changes of temperature; but the application of mathematical reasoning to the movements of an elastic fluid such as the air, charged with watery sapour, when submitted to changes of temperature upo:n a rotating sphere, presents very serious difficulties, and little has been done to grapple with them. What is known of these subjects is as yet almost e2:clusively empirical. Instrumental appliances are here far in advance of theories, and it is not to be disguised that great waste of labour too frequently results from an e2raggerated refinement in observation, and subsequent numerical computation, which has no real ralue. The air is a highly attenuated fluid medium, beneath which the whole surface of the earth is immersed, and by which all that is on the earth is surrounded, supported, and penetrated. It is the vehicle through which warmth, moisture, and the gaseous necessaries of life are supplied to all living things. The variations of the temperature, of the pressure, and of tile motion of the air, and of the quantity of vapour it con- tains, give rise to the great series of phenomena which are included under the general term climate. Of these variations the priinary causes are the action and reaction of the mechanical and chemical changes set up by the sun's lleat as infuenced by the earth's motion, terrestrial position, and the condition of its surface, as well as by fluctuations of the sun's heat itself, though of these last we know too little to do more than recognise their presellce. The conditions w:tlich determine at any place the greater or less degree and duration of direct e2rposure to solar radiation, and therefore the quantity of heat received there, are position in relation to latitude, combined with the diurnal and annual movements of the earth. The nature of the surface regulates the local accumulation of heat, by reason of the varying power of absorption or radiation possessed by diSerent substances; while with eleltation above the sea-level as the density of the air becomes less, the sensible temperature and the quantity of watery vapour are subject to corresponding change. The whole of the results thus produced, moreover, are modified by movements in the air consequent on atmospheric changes from place to place, or from time to time. All the determining causes of variation of climate just mentioned are brought into prominently contrasted action over areas of land and water. The equable sea climates on the one hand, and on the other the estreme variations of heat and cold, of drought and flood, on the great</page><page sequence="26">a30 LECTURES ON GEOGRAPHY, DELIVERED contine:ats, with the multitude of local results dependent on them, supply well-known illustrations of this truth. * The inequalities of the earth's surface, which are insignificant when viewed in relatioll to the whole globe, are o? the greatest importallce in relation to the atmosphere. For owing to the laws of elastic fuids, the great mass of the air and of the watery sapour it contains are con- centrated very near the surface. One-fourth of the air and one-half of the vapour are found below 8000 feet from the sea-level; one-half of the air and nine-tenths of the sapour are below 19,000 feet, whichhardly exceeds the average elevation of the hibhest ranges of the Himalaya Mountains; while three-fourths of the air and virtually the whole eSective vapour lie below 30,000 feet, and therefore within the influence of the highest summits of those mountains. That portioIL of the atslosphere which is nearest the surface is manifestly the :most likely to be acted upon by irregularities of relief, and by local variations in the ?ower of absorb;ng or radiating heat or diflusing sapour. He-.lce it is certain that it is the zmovemerlts of the lomTer strata of the atmospllere that chiefy aSect all conditions of climate, though :rlo doubt there are great movesnents in the upper regions to brint, about the restoratiorl of equilibrium, which is being constantly disturbed from below. The principal periodical winds such as the trade-winds, the mon- soons, the land and sea breezes are found to be essentially dependent on periodical variations of atmospheric pressure, accompanying variations of temperature due to geographical position or surface collditions. The pro:ximate causes of the more characteristic winds of the west of Europe, and especially of our own islands, have also been well made out. These, too, are dlle to atmospheric disturbances producing areas of higll or low pressure; the rapidity and intensity of the development of which, with the direction of their paths and their position, determine the force of the wina, the direction in which it blows, and the manner irl which it veers or backs, that is, changes its direction. But how the changes of pressure are determined, and what canses the transfer of the disturbed area, commonly under the form of arl atmosphelic eddy or vortes, in a definito direction, usually from west to east, is still to be aseertained; though here, too, it is obvious that the distribution of the land and sea areas, and of the oeean eurrents, on which the temperature of the supexineumbent air so imluediately dependss eombined with the rotatory rnotion of the earth, are among the principal ageneies at workv The winds of OU1' islands have eomrnonly, more or less distinetly, the gyratory eharaeter whieh, as before rxoted, ;s one of the seeondary results of the rotation of the earth. The preeise eonditions under whieh the great eyelones or hurrieanes of the tropies are generated are still uneertairl, but there is suffieient kl:rowledge of the manner of their oeourrenee to show that they are disturbanees set up by ehanges of te:mperature, and to enable the instrueted mariner in most eases to escape thear worst eonsequenees.</page><page sequence="27">S31 BEFORE THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, 1888. With the ocean, the air perfbrms the part of equalising temperature, and mitigating excessive local accumulations or losses of heat; and as the ocean supplies the source of moisture, so the air distributes it, first taking it up as vapour, and then carrying it of and delivering it up, with the heat absorbed during evaporation, at distant places. Among the most intricate problems of meteorology are those relating to the evaporation of water, the formation of vapour and its difusion and suspension in the air, and its condensation as cloud, rain, or snow. The low specific gravity of aqueous vapour, and the constant evaporation that releases it at the earth's surface, tend to diffuse it in accordance with the mechanical laws which goarern elastic fuids. But the reduction of the temperature of the air in ascending above the surface re:llders this difusion impossible beyond a certain point; and observation shows that the quantity of vapour actually existing in the upper parts of the atmo- sphere is mairlly dependent on temperature, and amounts to rlot; more than one-fourth part of what would be present if it were difFused freely, and simply obeyed the law of hydrostatic pressure. It follows that a height in the atmosphere is at length necessarily reached where condensation must take place and clouds or raill be formed; and that, speaking gene- rally, the vapour in the upper strata of the air - is constantly tending to a condition of ullstable equilibrium, from which it znay readily be orlce nlore restored to the earth in the shape of water. Thus, assuming the temperature of the air at the sea-level to be 80? F., and the quantity of vapour to be. 80 per cent. of what air at that temperature can hold in suspension, the free difusion of tlle vapour would cause it to ascend in such quantity that condensation would take place at a height o between 3000 and 4000 feet, that being the elevation at which, the temperature of the air being about 70? iE'., the ascending vapour could longer remain in suspension. Consequently clouds or rain would be formed at this elevation, and ally further movement of the vapour upward would be arrested. This sufliciently accounts for the rarity of a perfectly cloudless sky, which indeed can hardly exist, excepting where such a movement of the air is going on as will carry off the aqueous vapour, as fast as it is formed by evaporation, to a region where the temperature is high enough to prevent its colldensation. The great activity of the air in discharging the function of equalising temperature and distributing moisture over the earth is remarkable. If the whole quantity of moisture in the air at any monlent were con- densed so as to leave it algsolutely dry, the resulting stratum of water, if distributed evenly over the whole earth, would be less than one inch in depth. Yet it is estimated (though perhaps on insufficient data), that the mean rainfall over the Tvhole globe is not less than 60 inches in the year, and falls of te:n times this amount are known to occur in some localities. Observations of the velocity of the wind at marine &gt;;tations show that these results are due to the almost unceasing passage of air highly charged Wit]:l vapour over the regions where, and</page><page sequence="28">232 LEC1'URES ON GEOGRAPHY, DELIVERED during the time in which, rain thus falls, and to the unceasing renewal of the supply of moisture by evaporation. The relatively very lalge sea-area has an important effect in maintain;ng the supply of the rain that falls on the land; and the i:nluediate dependence of rainfall on local geographical feattlres is too well known to call for more than a passing remark. The presence of lnountains forining a barrier in the path of the vapour-bearing-winds may determine? on the one side a climato of perpetual cloud a:nd rain, and on the other vast tracts of desert. Where no lnountains exist to cause condensation such winds may pass on,- leaving deserts behind them, and carry their water3 to fertilise more fortunate lands beyond. The action of the periodical mrinds or monsoons in bringing with them the seasons of rain in the tropical and semi-tropical regions of the earth is of the greatest practical moment. The water-supply and the production of the ordinary food-crops are often wholly dependent on such rains; and the light thrown by science on the controlling causes of their failure or abundance may enable us to foresee the possible occurrence of drought, so as to guard against its worst consequences. Instances of the fall of rain in excesSive quantities on the windward faces of mountains exposed to mrinds blowing from over the sea, with relative drought to leeward, may be found in every part of the globe. In the British Isles, may be mentioned the excessive rain on the hills of Cumberlalid exposed to the sollth-west winds that blow directly up the Irish Sea and St. George's Channel. In Ireland the same facts are to be observed on every one of the clusters of hills that stand up above the otherwise low flat surface. The contrast between the fall of 73 inches at Bergell, on the coast of Norway, directly e2rposed to the south-west, and its reduction to one-third of that quantity at Christia:nia, and to one-fifth at Upsala on the continental side of the Scandinavian Peninsula, is most striking. The rainy and well-wooded eastern slopes of the Andes may be contrasted with the barren western flanks of the same chain, where it hardl- ener rains; and the rainless district of Chili on a west coast, south of the equator, coirlciding with the region of the south-east trade, where there is a constant current of air from the coast seaward, displaas almost the exact reverse of what is obser&gt;red north of the equator on parts of the west coasts of Europe and Asia, where the rain falls in torrents durillg the seasorks when the south-west vinds blow irtland frorn over the ocean. A iw words will indicate the magnitude of the forces which are called into silent and comparatively unobserved operation in the atmo- sphere by the sun's heat, in the productiorl and recondensation of aqueous vapour. It has, as I noticed, been estimated that on the average 5 feet of water falls anoually as rain over the whole earth. Supposing that condensation takes place at an average height of 3000 feet alJove the surface, the force of evaporation must be equivalent to a power</page><page sequence="29">233 BEFORE THE UNll7ERSlTY OF CAMBRIDGE, 1888. capable of lifting 5 feet of water over- the whole sulface of the ,lobe, 3000 feet during the year. This, not reckoning the force required for the transport of the rain ill a horizontal direction, would involve lifting 322,000 millions of pounds of water 3000 feet in every minuteP which would require about 300,000 million horse-power constantly ill operation. It may assist in the apprehension of these numbers to mention that the engines of the largest ironclad do not exceed 12,000 horse-power. Of the huge energies thus eserted a very smal] part is transferred to the waters that run back through rivers to the sea, and a still smaller fraction is utilised by man in his water-mills; the remainder is dissipated in celestial space. A mrell-known consequence of the physical properties of the air is the gradual reduction of temperature observed in ascending mountains This, amounting to 1? for about 300 feet of elevation, gradually produces a cllange of conditions similar to that caused by passing from the equator towards the poles; and at the greatest elevations an arctic climato is established even llnder a tropical sun. Among the sublimest sifflhts furnished by nature are the great ranges of mountains which traverse or approach the tropics; risillg into the regions of perpetual snow, they discharge important functions in thet economy of the globe. By the intrusion of the solid-terrestrial sur- face into the tlpper part of the atmosphere, the low tenlperature there, which otherwise could have produced no eSect on the earth, is brought into active operation; great rivers spring from the melting fields of snow and ice that crown the mountain summits, and swollen bythe copious condensation of rain on their slopes, flow down to the plains below, which are fertilised by their perennial waters. Ice, whether in the shape of glaciers excavating their mountain beds, or as the floating fragments of glaciers which, forming icebergs, tear up the iloor of the ocean, or when by expanding in the fissures of rocks it rends them asunder, is one of tlae most energetic of destructive agents. The recurrence in the earth's past history of glacial epochs alternating with epochs of greater heat, of which geology supplies eridence, is of much interest, and has given rise to much speculation. Among possible causes of this are to be reckoned the variations which in the lapse of time take place in the ellipticity of the earth's orbit, combined with changes of the position of the asis due to precession. At a period of masimum ellipticity, the qualltities of heat received by the earth, at its least and greatest distances from the sun respectively, must be increased and diminished accordingly; and should it happerl that at such a time the change in the direction of the earth?s asis caused by precession, brought either hemisphere to face the sun fully when nearest to the earth, very considerable eSects on the summer and winter temperatures of the two hemisphere3 must be produced, without afEectiny the mean temperature of tte globe; in the more directlisr exposed hemisphere the</page><page sequence="30">234 GEOGRAPHIC-4L NOTES. summer would be shorter and hotter, and the winter longer and colder, while in the other hemisphere there would be a milder and shorter winter, and a longer but colder summer. Displaceluents o? the earth's axis of rotation have also been suggested as a means of accounting for some of the great local changes of tenlperature indicated by geology; but the evidences of such displacements hardly amount to laore than arguments, based on mathematical reasoning, rhich show that they are not incompatible with established facts.
