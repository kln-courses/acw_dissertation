<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Image of Ganymede in France, 1730-1820: The Survival of a Homoerotic Myth Michael Preston Worley This study focuses on artistic representations of the homo- erotic myth of the rape of Ganymede in France from the Enlightenment to the Napoleonic era, when there were almost as many versions as in the Italian Renaissance.' Citing twenty-two examples from that earlier period, James Saslow showed how popular the subject was in the Renaissance, and how it was almost always conceived as a Neoplatonic allegory. In eighteenth-century France the rape of Ganymede lost its symbolic meaning as an emblem of celestial love in the Neoplatonic sense, which it had attained in the Italian Renaissance, but the subject of Ganymede was by no means forgotten between 1730 and 1820, when at least nineteen French representations were produced. These will be re- viewed, after some introductory remarks on the interpreta- tion of the myth. The subject of Ganymede has been studied in ancient and Renaissance art, but not in subsequent periods, perhaps because the theme lost its philosophical dimension and thus appeared to scholars as less consequen- tial.2 After the Renaissance the story of Jupiter's abduction of the Phrygian shepherd Ganymede, known to artists largely through Ovid (Metamorphoses, 10), became a decorative sujet galant in which the erotic element far overshadowed the connotations of spiritual perfection attained through divine love. Clearly, in the Sibcle des Lumieres there was little interest in Plato's transcendental idealism. The philosophes pointed to Plato's morals as important source material for the Enlightenment,3 but the dialogue on love in Plato's Symposium did not seem to be relevant to their endeavors. In art during the Rococo age, Plato's Common Aphrodite dominated as a symbol of love's pleasurable pursuits, while Spiritual Love belonged to Christian iconography exclu- sively. Although Greek studies were less emphasized in the early eighteenth century than in the previous one,4 there was a scholarly interest in Greek literature, mythology, and philoso- phy. Andre Dacier's translation of Plato's works (1699) and Mme Dacier's Iliad (1711) remained in use through the century.5 Abbe Banier's Explication historique des fables of the same year became the standard euhemerist approach to ancient mythology, interpreting the myths as historical events,6 and R acine's translation of Plato's Symposium was published for the first time in 1732.7 Most works of erudition came later in the century: the introduction to Charles Rollin's popular Histoire ancienne (1730-38); Abbe Mably's Observations sur l'histoire de la Grace (1749); L'Origine des dieux du paganisme by the anti-philosophe Abbe Bergier (1767); the three volumes of the Encyclopidie dedicated to ancient and modern philosophy (1751-72); Cornelius de Pauw's Re- cherches philosophiques sur les Grecs (1788); and Etienne Bon- not de Condillac's Histoire ancienne, published in his com- plete works in 1798, to name only the most famous historical studies of classical religion and mythology. Plato's writings did not arouse much interest among modern French philosophers, who tended to be more com- mitted to the Aristotelian tradition. German thinkers, on the other hand, led the way in serious erudition in Platonic studies; and in the early nineteenth century the French followed Tiedemann, Schleiermacher, and Ast.8 Likewise, the Neoplatonic elements in Winckelmann's aesthetic theory were taken up by Quatrembre de Quincy, who carried the banner of idealism with Ingres, as the Neoclassical style was slowly becoming overshadowed by other artistic movements.9 There was a good deal of interest in Socrates as a symbol of liberal thinking and freedom in the face of tyranny; the philosophes saw him as a predecessor who opposed the 1. This paper was prompted in part by J. Saslow's Ganymede in the Renaissance: Homosexuality in Art and Society, New Haven, 1986, in which the review of Ganymedes in French art ends at about 1650 with versions by Eustache Le Sueur and Romanelli. The author hastily concludes (185): "the subject effec- tively vanishes from French art. Apart from an occasional garden sculpture, the myth seems to have held little appeal for later patrons and artists." A more recent study of Ganymede in the Renais- sance is by A.

Rousseau's passion for Socrates has also been stud- ied; following the Christian humanist tradition, Rousseau drew parallels between Socrates and Christ,'2 and like Diderot, he regarded Socrates' death as proof of his philo- sophical integrity. The death of Socrates was the rallying point for the philosophes, who saw the event as "the first crime that signaled the war between philosophy and supersti- tion,"13 and in eighteenth-century painting the iconography of Socrates was focused almost exclusively on this scene (there are a few representations of Socrates' friendship with Alcibiades).14 The philosopher's death, the subject of eight tragedies between 1759 and 1808 and at least fourteen works of art between 1753 and 1796, has been the object of a recent study of deathbed representations.15 It is not surprising that in the Enlightenment, when idealistic philosophy was long out of fashion, there was little interest in the Neoplatonic metaphor of Ganymede's divine transport. Pierre Bayle, who explained the myths of antiquity as the result of a primitive fear of nature, wondered how Jupiter, guilty of every monstrous crime, could be regarded as the supreme governor of the world, worshiped as the greatest of the gods: "He was guilty of unnatural sin; for he stole away the beautiful Ganymede, and preferred him to the office of cupbearer to the gods, that he might have him at hand, as often as his heart desired."16 F.-J.-M. Noil, who revised Pierre Chomprd's Dictionnaire abrige de la fable (1727), explained the Ganymede myth in a euhemerist manner. Tros had sent his son Ganymede to Lydia to offer sacrifices to Jupiter; the Lydian King Tantalus imprisoned Ganymede as a spy, but eventually the youth became cupbearer at court. Ganymede's capture caused a long war between the two countries that ended in the fall of Troy.17 Bayle, however, acknowledged another reason behind Ganymede's arrest, quoting the fifth-century Spanish priest Orosius, author of Adversus paganos historiarum: "Tantalus ... having most wickedly ravished Ganymede, ... detained him for a more shameful purpose."'18 Seventeenth-century French painters went to Ovid's Meta- morphoses when called upon to represent allegories of Louis XIV in mythological disguise. In the eighteenth century there were fewer mythological decorations tied to political programs,'9 and allegory was used less frequently. The Metamorphoses continued to be a major source for French artists, who often apparently failed to discern the deeper meanings of the stories. Gradually, themes from Homer took over, as the Rococo declined. Between 1757 and 1777 Ovidian themes far outweighed stories from the Iliad in the Salon. The year 1781 was the turning point, when there were four Homeric themes to one from Ovid, and between 1783 and 1789 the majority of mythological subjects were taken from Homer. DorothyJohnson sees David's Amours de Paris et d'He'lne of 1788 as an example of the renewed interest in erotic Greek subject matter, which had been temporarily out of fashion.20 Earlier, Ovid's stories of love were used to complement the more serious themes in the Iliad. In the decorative project for the Petit Trianon of 1768, floral subjects taken from the Metamorphoses, including a Hyacinthus by Nicolas-Rene Jol- lain, exhibited in the Salon of 1769,21 were found to be more suitable than the initially planned illustrations from Homer and Tasso, which were deemed "trop serieux.'"22 Homer, Virgil, and Ovid were the recommended authors for students in the Ecole des Elikves Prot6g6s. Bernard L6picie, history professor and secritaire perpituel at the school, explained in 1749 that after supper they read history and then, "we will read Homer, Virgil, Ovid, and the remaining authors who wrote on fables"; in 1782 it was specified in the school's regulations that Homer, Virgil, and Ovid would be read because a knowledge of mythology was essential to artists.23 The Metamorphoses was one of the books requested by Lagren&amp;e l'afn" (also in 1782) for students in the French Academy in Rome. However, the director's complaint to the comte d'Angiviller, the Directeur des Baitiments du Roi, that the academy did not have a library shows that no special emphasis was placed there on scholarly and literary re- sources.24 While Ovid's Metamorphoses was used by artists, it was not promoted in theoretical circles. The reformers of French 12. D. Leduc-Fayette, J.-J. Rousseau et le mythe de l'antiquiti, Paris, 1974, is one such study. There was a tradition of linking Socrates and Christ: see J. Vernet, Traitj de la viritj de la religion chritienne, Geneva, 1730-36, for one of the earliest studies of this theme. 13. Translations are by the author, unless otherwise indicated.

A critic named Saint-Yves, often at odds with contemporary artists-though he did admire Boucher's elegant figures and enchanting compositions-advised paint- ers to study the most grand and interesting historical and morally edifying subjects.25 The moralistic amateur d'art La Font de Saint-Yenne also saw a need for a renewal of history painting and he named Homer, Virgil, Horace, Tasso, Milton, and the Bible as the most noble sources for the grand genre.26 While studying the classics, the history painter was to study how the great masters treated drawing, costume, religion, and customs appropriate to the subject to be depicted. The antiquarian and connoisseur Caylus also advised students to read ancient authors, since their task was to convey the greatest examples of "morale et h6roisme."27 Caylus himself failed to see any spiritual meaning or moral values in Ovid's tales, whereas scenes from Homer "embody attractiveness, strength, correctness, a grand scope, noble- ness of sentiment; lastly, everything that leads to total heroism."28 Finally, Rousseau deplored the themes in Ro- coco painting as corrupters of taste, and he named Ovid specifically as an obscene author. He lamented the frivolous, lusty escapades of the ancient gods and challenged painters to turn from the lascivious decoration on coach panels to the majesty and sublimity of religious painting, and the virtuous images of defenders of the country or other grands hommes.29 For Ganymede, artists had to go to sources in ancient vase painting and sculpture in royal and private collections-for example, the Roman copy of the famous statue by Leochares (mid-fourth century B.C.; Vatican Museums)-or to the few modern examples.30 Eustache Le Sueur had done three versions for the Cabinet de l'Amour in the H6tel Lambert: the most famous one (ca. 1644), now in the Louvre, shows an apparently willing Ganymede riding the eagle; the decora- tive, billowing drapery had been a means to suggest wind or motion in flight ever since antiquity.31 The statues in the gardens of Versailles by Pierre Laviron (1684-85; Parterre de Latone) and Jean Joly (executed in Rome in 1683 for the Bosquet de l'Etoile) may have been more accessible, as were the Greco-Roman examples in the royal collection.32 The most famous eighteenth-century books of iconography, which did not include the rape of Ganymede as an emblem of divine love, were no help to artists looking for images of this subject. Alciati's emblem of "Rejoicing in God," which features Ganymede being carried away by the eagle, was one available source.33 Ripa illustrated other types of love (of fellow man, of God, of virtue, and Tamed Love);34 in the French version edited by Baudouin in 1694, Divine Love is a purely Christian symbol and Virtuous Love is the classical winged child with garlands.35 Gravelot and Cochin's Iconolo- gie parfigures (1791) also showed Love as the familiar winged boy.36 A popular French version of the Metamorphoses, edited by Abbe Banier and published in Amsterdam in 1732, included an engraving of the rape of Ganymede by Bernard Picart (1673-1733), heavily indebted to Damiano Mazza's version from about 1575 (London, National Gallery).37 The editor commented that the myth showed how the pagans regarded their gods, since the attribution of these "most vile weak- nesses" was not enough to make them blush. Further charges of obscenity in connection with the myth of Ganymede in Salon criticism will be explored below. Banier had a good opportunity to stress the noble character of the myth but instead he used it as an example of heathen immorality; a true humanist would have drawn parallels between the image and the Christian doctrine of salvation. Banier and other mythographers reduced pagan myths to rationalistic and euhemerist explanations by factual and historical methods. The sexual escapades of the gods were simply the reflections of human activity, and in this interpre- tation of mythology there was no room for Neoplatonic exegesis. Jean Starobinski has explained how this view of pagan mythology and the rejection of its spiritual signifi- cance became a way to insinuate disbelief in the Christian doctrine of immortality.38 In the eighteenth century both pagan mythology and the Bible were relegated to a lower position in the dynamics of world history, below scientific and empirical explanations. Classical mythology was no longer able to live in peaceful coexistence with Christianity, 25. Saint-Yves, Observations sur les arts.

Conversely, traditional Christian apologists, Charles Rollin, for example, pointed to the fables to show the unfortunate state of humankind before the coming of Christ: "This triumph of the Christian religion, ought to give us a due sense of our obligations to Jesus Christ, and . . . of the darkness to which all mankind were abandoned before his coming." Rollin expressed the antihumanist sentiment that the "heathens" were hardly a model of morality.40 Similarly, Abbe Lionnois, in his handbook of mythology for young people (1804), believed that the lesson of ancient fables was that Christ drew us out of the darkness: "[the study] will inspire a new respect for the august majesty of Christianity and for the sanctity of its morality."41 Abbe Bergier at- tempted to show that the Church Fathers had renounced Greek philosophy as barbaric and that they attacked Plato's doctrines in particular. His article on Platonism was a defense of the contemporary Catholic position against Prot- estants who criticized the Church Fathers as neopagans.42 Bergier acknowledged a sect of "Eclectics" who, in the desire to instruct heretics and philosophes, took the most valid principles from various philosophies and showed that they were in no way contrary to Christian dogma. Bayle's remark about the sordid nature of the subject of Ganymede requires at least a brief look at attitudes toward homosexuality. After all, at the time the name Ganymede intimated a passive homosexual.43 In a theoretical sense, the "sexual liberation" of the Enlightenment encouraged an ambience in which homosexuality would be more tolerated; at least the philosophes provided a new forum for discussion. In his article "Socratic Love,"44 Voltaire dwelled on the physical aspects of what we know now to be a complex, ideal friendship between the youth (erimenos) and the older lover (erastis) in ancient Greece.45 In the rites of passage to manhood, the sexual relationship was only part of the initiatory phase of the youth's moral education. The erdmenos was to yield to the erastis' desires only if his love was accompanied by wisdom and virtue; still, chaste lovers were regarded as the most noble.46 Voltaire insisted that the Greeks did not practice a love "that insults nature," and "infamous love" was linked to the caprices of his enemies, the ecchlsiastiques.47 Yet the great philosophe did not speculate on the spiritual friendship/love between males, which became a key concept in the writings of Winckelmann, his German contemporary.48 In L'Esprit des lois (1748) Montesquieu proposed that societies prohibit the crime of sodomy because it merely transfers the weakness of one sex to the other and paves the way to a "disgraceful old age."49 On the other hand, he questioned the severe punishment by fire for witchcraft, heresy, and the crime "against nature" (the definition of the latter he regarded as especially vague and subjective). Rous- seau's traumatic experiences with pederastic advances are detailed in his Confessions, and in his aversion to same-sex love-what today would be called homophobia-he turned to heterosexual promiscuity. Diderot showed more of an enlightened, pragmatic view in his belief that no act in human behavior could be against nature (anti-physique) since it was obviously part of nature, and he regarded homosexual- ity and self-stimulation as preferable to chastity.50 Diderot's concise article "Platonisme ou philosophie de Platon" in the Encyclopidie did not include a reference to "Platonic love."51 Like Voltaire and Rousseau, Diderot dealt only with the physical expression of love (sodomie), but he was aware of a link between physical love and religion in Greek culture, and the corresponding ennobled passions. He wondered what religious art would have become if the Holy Spirit had been attracted to the Virgin Mary's physical features, if the Magdalene had experienced an aventure galante with Christ, or if Christ had fondled the breasts of one of the bridesmaids at the Marriage at Cana, or perhaps even St. John's behind.52 Finally, Condorcet seems to have been the most tolerant: "Sodomy, when unaccompanied by violence, cannot fall within the competence of criminal law. It violates no one's rights."53 Although he regarded sodomy as a "disgusting vice," the only appropriate punishment should be society's 42.

Winckelmann's writ- ings and Goethe's poem Ganymed (1774) crystallize the Neoplatonic current in this pre-Romantic pe- riod of German culture.

In effect, as long as there was no serious crime in association with a homosexual encounter, sodomy was toler- ated among an elite of the nobility, the clergy, artists, and scholars. But in the bourgeoisie and lower classes any homosexual acts or inclinations were sought out and crushed. Although there were only seven offenders burned at the stake between 1700 and 1789, five of whom committed more serious crimes, male love was vigorously tracked down by mouches, or police informers, and those caught in the trap were jailed in the Bicetre prison unless they agreed to work for the secret police themselves. The police records of the period disclose an interesting homosexual underworld culture, however, in which sadists and killers tend to be highlighted; the world of the more charming and romantic love relationships remains more nebulous. Of the little research that has been done, Michael Rey's has revealed lasting male partnerships among the lower classes, including a man who lived with a priest, posing as his cousin, and two lackeys named Duquesnel and Du- maine, who slept together for two years; in another case a servant confided to a priest that he was looking for a pleasurable relationship with a friend.54 Winckelmann, who searched for an ideal "heroic friendship" all his life, could name only one modern male couple: two Venetian noblemen of the seventeenth century, Marco Trevisan and Niccol6 Barbarigo. Joseph Eiselein, who published Winckelmann's complete works in 1829, records what was known of these special friends, who astonished and moved their contempo- raries.55 In the arts, the scarcity of gay subjects makes our quest for the eighteenth-century Orestes and Pylades more difficult. D. A. Coward notes that in the novel "male homosexuals are chiefly remarkable by their absence." 56 There were instances of homosexual pornographic literature, for example, the anticlerical novel L'Histoire du Dom Bougre, portier des char- treux (1741), in which a young candidate for the priesthood is "sexually initiated" by Pere Casimir, who praises the "bou- gres c1elbres" throughout history.57 When homosexual mythological themes did appear they were either heterosexu- alized or desexualized. A good example is the young Mozart's opera Apollo and Hyacinthus (K. 38). At its premiere in the Benedictine University of Salzburg in 1767, the audience heard nothing of Apollo's love for Hyacinthus, as described by the Greek sources. The monk Rufinus Widl had rewritten the story to include Hyacinthus's sister Melia, beloved by Apollo and Zephyr. The latter has Hyacinthus killed and accuses Apollo of the crime; in the happy ending Apollo and Melia are married.58 Ironically, the part of Melia was played by a choirboy named Felix Fuchs. The libretto's heterosexual revision corresponds to Racine's cautious translation of Plato's Symposium, in which "young man" becomes "young person" (jeune personne), in reference to the object of an older man's desires. In the pedagogical handbook Lettres a Emilie sur la mythologie (1786-98), Charles-Albert Demoustier clearly differentiated Apollo's friendship with Hyacinthus from his loves with mortal women.59 All of these revisionists erased the physical, emotional, and spiritual elements of the ancient Greek same-sex experience in their heterosexualization of the story. Toward the beginning of the nineteenth century there</page><page sequence="6">THE IMAGE OF GANYMEDE IN FRANCE 635 were a few representations of Apollo's male loves: one, for example, is the painting La Mort d'Hyacinthe by Jean Broc (1801; Poitiers, Mus&amp;e des Beaux-Arts), in which Apollo tenderly supports the dying boy whom he loved "beyond all other mortals" (Metamorphoses, 10). The androgynized fig- ures have the delicate anatomy and porcelainlike surfaces typical of the mannered style of the period. The sentimental Freundschaftsbild shows the degree to which homosexual themes were interpreted in terms of innocent, adolescent infatuations, and reflects Voltaire's account of the attraction to beautiful youths as an ephemeral trick of nature.60 Other versions followed: a standing nude figure of Hyacinthus by Charles-Antoine Callamard (1769 or 1776-1821), conceived in 1802 (the marble version exhibited in the Salon of 1812, no. 1024, is now in a square in Lamalou-les-Bains);61 a statue by Frangois-Joseph Bosio (Salon of 1817, no. 798), in which Hyacinthus is depicted lying down, at the moment of rest before the discus was launched;62 Jacques R6attu's Apollon jouant au disque avec Hyacinthe (1818-24; Arles, Musie Reattu),63 which shows the moment before Hyacinthus's fatal accident; and finally, a marble statue of Hyacinthus being struck by the discus (1829; Mus6e d'Angers) by Antoine Etex (1808-1888). The other major theme was Apollo and Cyparissus, the youth, beloved of Apollo, who died of sadness after inadvert- ently slaying the god's favorite stag. Versions adhering to the chaste, prepubescent physical type that was in vogue are by Denis-Antoine Chaudet (plaster, Salon of 1798, no. 510; marble, Salon of 1810, no. 934, St. Petersburg, Hermit- age);64 Jean-Pierre Granger (Salon of 1817);65 and Claude- Marie Dubufe (1821; Avignon, Mus6e Calvet).66 Artists who illustrated these Ovidian homoerotic myths uniformly chose the noble moment of Liebestod, as if no other scene from the lives of Apollo's er6menoi would be worthy of depiction. Although the general outcome of gods loving mortals was tragic, there are countless renderings in eighteenth-century art of Jupiter's more gentle seductions of women. In con- trast, Italian Renaissance artists were able to represent Apollo and Hyacinthus in frankly sexual poses. One ex- ample, the engraving after Jacopo Caraglio's rendering (Paris, Bibliothbque Nationale), shows both figures in the nude, seated in a position with overlapping legs and fully exposed genitals. Le doux nectar est servi par Hebe, Et par l'enfant du fondateur de Troie Qui dans Ida par un aigle enleve De son seigneur en secret fait lajoie. --Voltaire, La Pucelle, canto 4 Traditionally, images of the myth of Ganymede feature the youth serving nectar to Jupiter, still in the form of an eagle, or Ganymede in the act of being carried off by the eagle. The few versions in which Jupiter is transformed back into his anthropomorphic shape include the fresco after Baldassare Peruzzi's designs in the Villa Madama and the forged antique painting of Ganymede, attributed to Mengs and Casanova, that fooled Winckelmann, Goethe, and others (Rome, Galle- ria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna).67 The latter picture was based on Raphael's spandrel design of Jupiter kissing Cupid. In France, Ganymede makes his eighteenth-century debut in a room dedicated to the loves ofJupiter in the chateau of La Chapelle-Godefroy, painted by Charles Natoire from 1731 to 1740. Philibert Orry, comte de Vignory (1689-1747), who had just become Contr6leur G6neral des Finances, commis- sioned the decoration. In 1737 Orry reestablished the Salon exhibitions, which had been suspended since 1704. Later he held the position of Directeur General des Batiments du Roi (1737-45). In the oval dessus de porte (Fig. 1), a pendant to Danae (ca. 1731; now in Troyes, Mus6e des Beaux-Arts),68 the eagle carries Ganymede away, and the trustful youth gently rests one hand on the bird's head and looks lovingly into his eyes. For the composition with the billowing drapery and the eagle clutching Ganymede's leg, Natoire relied on Le Sueur's earlier version, but the pose recalls Pietro da Cortona's fresco in the Pitti Palace (Sala di Venere) of Minerva taking Youth away from Venus. Natoire's elegant and effeminate adolescent was the prototype for all succes- sive versions in France. Also in 1731 Carle Vanloo depicted Ganymede in a dessus 54. M.

Baltimore, Walters Art Gallery (photo: Walters Art Gallery) de porte for a room in the Palais Mancini, the French Academy in Rome. The version in the Musee des Augustins, Toulouse, is thought to be a good copy. The director of the Academy, Nicolas Vleughels, described this early work as "truly good; we are quite pleased with it."''69 Ganymede is seen in flight with the eagle, and this becomes the standard composition in French painting; the figural arrangement of crossing diagonals was a popular Rococo format. Below is a rudimentary landscape setting. The delicate, fleshy, and sensuous youth stares into the eyes of the eagle and holds onto his neck. The pose, with one leg bent back and the body tilting to the left, recalls the figure of Lucretia, another victim of lust, in Tintoretto's Tarquin and Lucretia (1559; Art Institute of Chicago), a painting from the collection of Cardinal de Bernis, who was French ambassador to Venice between 1751 and 1755. Another source might have been Caravaggio's Amore vittorioso (1598-99 or 1602) in Berlin, from the Giustiniani collection, which would link Vanloo's Ganymede directly to an image of profane love. Caravaggio's uninhibited Eros, a pendant to Giovanni Baglione's Amor divino, also in Berlin, must have been shocking to those visiting Vincenzo Giustini- ani's collection, where the painting was covered with a green silk curtain and revealed at the end of one's tour as a sensational curiosity piece.70 Such writers as Howard Hib- bard regard the Cupid as "an object of pederastic interest,"71 and this earthly Eros has been opposed to the images of a more ideal beauty that inspired Caravaggio directly- Michelangelo's Victory, of about 1527 (Florence, Palazzo della Signoria), and two of his ignudi on the Sistine ceiling.72 Vanloo spent his youth in Italy (1712-20 and 1728-32), where he studied under Benedetto Luti and became familiar with the Renaissance and Baroque masters, and with the painterly techniques of Venice that were emphasized by Vleughels. In Vanloo's Ganymede three types of differently colored drapery underscore the luxuriousness of this Rococo rape, and indicate the painter's Venetian source. Neverthe- less, it is difficult to relate this rather dark, bland, and somewhat damaged copy to Vanloo's other works executed in Rome, which are painted in a vigorous, Italianate manner. His Ende portant Anchise in the Louvre (1729) and the sketch in the Stair Sainty Matthiesen collection, New York,73 sug- gest the richness of Vanloo's palette during this period. Probably around the same time Robert Le Lorrain ex- ecuted a life-size marble bust of Ganymede (now lost), a pendant to Flora, for a stairway in the H6tel Blondel de Gagny, Place Vend6me.74 Such an ornamental bust is likely to have had little iconographical significance. Jean-Baptiste- Marie Pierre's Ganimede versant le nectar, another lost work, was exhibited in the Salon of 1743 (no. 95). It is known through an engraving by Johann Martin Preissler (1715- 1794), done in the same year.75 Vanloo's Ganymede was Pierre's obvious source: the diagonal compositional type, figural pose, and interaction of Ganymede and his winged abductor originated in Vanloo's dessus de porte. Pierre's Ganymede looks longingly at the eagle, while gently holding onto his neck; with his left hand he makes a gesture that appears to signify both surprise and abandon. Pierre relied less on the effects of billowing drapery and omitted the landscape entirely. This, as well as the Ganymedes by Natoire and Vanloo, are in the Rococo style, rendering the shep- herd's abduction as merely a picturesque and playful scene of love's passion, rather than an illustration of a nobler love. Guillaume I Coustou's nephew Claude-Clair Francin (1702-1773) showed a plaster Ganymede in the Salon of 1745 (no. 163), a sketch for the marble version commissioned for the gardens ofVersailles in 1743, which was unfinished at the sculptor's death. Originally intended to accompany Jean- Joseph Vinache's Aurora (1746-49) and Nicolas-S~bastien Adam's Iris (1743-45), also at Versailles, it was moved to the gardens of the chateau of Pontchartrain in 1777 and there completed by Nicolas-Francois Dupr6 around 1779 (Balti- more, Waiters Art Gallery; Fig. 2).76 The design of this rather elongated adolescent type is based on an elegant S-curve sweep from the right leg, through the body of the eagle, ending up in the right arm. As in earlier French versions by Le Sueur and Natoire, Ganymede embraces the eagle. The gently classical features of the head make the gaze seems less amorous, since a classicized face is almost always lacking in</page><page sequence="8">THE IMAGE OF GANYMEDE IN FRANCE 637 expression. The usual attributes, the vase and cup, were not included, but the clouds represent the sculptor's attempt to indicate either the flight or the Olympian setting. Overall, the group has the quality of an elegant porcelain table decoration rather than a garden statue. Guillaume II Coustou's marble statue of Ganymede was carved around 1760 (London, Victoria and Albert Museum; Fig. 3).77 In a break with the Rococo, this figure goes back to the tradition of classicizing statues that decorated seven- teenth-century French gardens, and it should be compared with the versions by Laviron and Joly in the grounds of Versailles mentioned above. In both those copies of the antique Ganymedes, an elegant Praxitelian adolescent em- braces the eagle, which stands majestically on rocks below. Coustou's figure conveys a marked sense of verticality and stability that recalls the Doryphoros and its Roman deriva- tions. This is a languid, yet solidly formed youth graced with classical proportions. The artist may have been inspired by an Antinous, perhaps the one in the Museo Capitolino recorded in the Albani collection in 1733 and copied by Jacques Saly in 1747 for Louis XV.78 In particular, the treatment of the hair and the morbidezza of Ganymede's face approach the original antique version. The somewhat comi- cal miniature eagle that minimizes Jupiter's violent act may also be a reference to the ancient Greek practice of giving cockerels and other small animals to the erastis during the period of courtship. Coustou's Ganymede is the only example of the subject treated in the Neoclassical style; other artists, even those active in the late eighteenth century, conceived of Ganymede in the Rococo style, perhaps because of the subject's erotic or decorative nature. Another garden statue, this time with a pendant Hebe, was the marble Ganymede erected by Joseph Chinard on the property of M. de Boin in Forez, for which not even a description survives (present whereabouts unknown; late 1770s-early 1780s).79 Besides garden statues, terra-cotta figurines became popular in the eighteenth century. Barth,- lemy Blaise's Ganymede (Fig. 4) and Hebe, signed and dated 1778, from the collection of Mme Armand de Caillavet are fine examples. Blaise's expressive figure is a large, rather finished terra cotta. The abducted youth with cup in hand strokes the eagle's neck, as if he now understands his duties as the god's beloved. The handsome boy's idealized Greek profile and sensuous, flowing hair are characteristic of most Ganymedes of the period. 3 Guillaume II Coustou, Ganymede, ca. 1760.

Paris, Mus&amp;e du Louvre (photo: R6union des Mus~es Nationaux) The statue of Ganymede by Pierre Julien (1731-1804) from the Salon of 1785 (Louvre; Figs. 5-7) is another example of the charming late Rococo male figure with slightly classiciz- ing features. But style is not the important consideration here. The sculpture was one of the first works of art in eighteenth-century France to elicit charges of obscenity because of its homoerotic subject. Even more significant is Julien's direct reference to love through symbolic attributes carved into the base of the statue, thus emphasizing the homosexual nature of the myth. On a more general level, other examples of the censorship of works of art because of their nudity will be presented. In late eighteenth-century France there was an uneasiness about viewing nudity-even classical ideal nudes-especially in open, public spaces. Julien's Ganymede, his morceau de reception, had been submitted-and rejected-in 1776. Julien's master, Cous- tou, who is believed to have wanted Julien to remain in his studio to help finish some of his own sculptures, had arranged secretly for his pupil's disgrace.80 Julien's friend Jacques-Philippe Dauphin de Beauvais (1739-1781) pro- tested the Academie's action by destroying one of his own works, thereby delaying his entrance into the Academie.8' With the intrigue of this incident behind him, Julien was able to win praise from almost all of the salonniers when he submitted another version of the work in 1785.82 The critic of the Mercure de France thought it was praiseworthy for its beauty of form, the appropriateness of its proportions, and its high finish of execution.83 Baron Grimm, one of the major literary and philosophical critics of the Enlightenment, made congratulatory remarks about Julien; he was thoroughly 80. See J. Le Breton, Notice historique sur la vie et les ouvrages de PierreJulien, Statuaire ... , Paris, 1805, 34, 36-42; and L.-P. Deseine, Notices historiques sur les anciennes acadimies royales de peinture, sculpture de Paris et celle d'architecture, Paris, 1814. The rejection must have been quite traumatic, for Julien, like David four years earlier, thought of committing suicide. See F. Mandet, Histoire du Velay, Le Puy, 1861, vii, 310. Without official acceptance by the Academie, there was no real future or reputation for an artist; at least, Julien had no hopes of ever obtaining royal commissions. Le Breton, 39, re- lated how Julien had determined to seek employ- ment as a carver of ships' prows in Rochefort. It is not known ifJulien ever discovered who was behind this scandal, but he did confide in Le Breton that he never fully recovered from its psychological effects. 81.

Julien's talent for rendering finished, naturalistic details is vividly revealed here. The critic who called himself "Le Peintre anglais" was equally pleased with this well-proportioned adolescent nude, "of a ravishing beauty." He thought it expressed la belle nature, that is, the most beautiful parts of nature combined into an ideal whole, the forms that ancient sculptors were thought to have achieved.85 Another critic also made a direct reference to classical sculpture-"Julien's Ganymede has a pose worthy of antique simplicity"-but, differing from Grimm's assessment, he found minor flaws in the feet and hands.86 Abbe Jean-Louis-Giraud Soulavie (1751 or 1752- 1813), in Rflexions impartiales, said that the statue was beautifully shaped, masterly and very pleasant.87 Critics were pleased with the execution of Julien's statue, except for minor imperfections. The author of Coup de patte ("vulgar abuse") wrote another brochure in which he expressed great amazement at the lifelike qualities of the Ganymede; despite minor deficiencies, the statue made him think of Puget.88 At least two critics expressed reservations about illustrat- ing the subject ofJupiter in the form of an eagle abducting a young boy. The lawyer Moufle d'Angerville (d. 1794), who was later an enemy of the Revolution, objected to it on moral grounds. He thought the theme of Ganymede was more dangerous to public morals than that of Psyche: "The very name of this handsome young man recalls a most obscene by President Hocquart, marquis de Montfermeil, went to his chateau and was confiscated during the Revolution; in 1793 it was sent to Versailles and eventually it entered the Louvre.

Bayonne, Mus6e Bonnat (photo: Mus&amp;e Bonnat) fable ... with its eyes, the eagle seems to devour the seductive, nude cupbearer; it hugs him closely, and amo- rously caresses his buttocks with its wing."89 Thus, he objected specifically to the eagle about to ravish the seductive youth, made obvious by the passionate embrace of Ganymede's buttocks by the bird's wings (Fig. 7). He con- cluded, however, that a finer marble could not have been executed and he agreed that the work deserved universal commendation. Another critic was equally concerned about the "immoral" subject matter. He would have preferred to see a "more natural" form of love: one of Jupiter's hetero- sexual escapades would have been completely acceptable.90 The reference to Psyche, however, reminds us of the shock effect of male and female nudity, and of the fact that some works of art were censored as late as the First Empire. The example in question was Augustin Pajou's Psyche abandonnie (plaster, Salon of 1785; marble, Salon of 1791, Louvre). After being condemned by the cure of Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois, the state's official censor, the plaster version was removed to Pajou's studio where the sculptor had to accommodate eager crowds.91 Earlier, lascivious nudes had been purged from the Salon exhibitions by the comte d'Angiviller, who made it clear that the king did not want visitors to the Salon to be shocked by brazen nudes.92 Another statue that the cure regarded as unfit for the Salon was Houdon's life-size, fully nude plaster Diana (Gotha: Schlossmuseum).93 The literary critic Jean-Frangois Delaharpe (1739-1803) reported that the statue was "too beautiful and too nude ... [to be] exposed to the public,"94 and it was displayed in Houdon's studio. While the Church and officials of the Academie censored "obscene" art in the Salons, there were others who objected to nude statues in outdoor public spaces. One instance occurred during the planning of the parade of classical statues taken from Italy through the streets of Paris in July 1798. Napoleon's booty included the Laoco6n, the Apollo Belvedere, the Spinario, and the Horses of St. Mark's. The publicist Paul-Frangois Barbault-Royer (dates unknown), who edited several newspapers during the Directory and later worked for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, feared the forthcoming exhibition of such "indecent" sculpture, espe- cially when exposed to young people: It is ridiculous to subject our innocent youth to such naked images; after viewing these objects time after time, our speech will become less respectable, our conversation more audacious. [These statues] are likely to sanction our corruption, to push indolence toward moral baseness, and to shape us gradually to the most despicable slavery.95 The author explained that nudity in public monuments had its place in Greek and Roman religion but in modern-day France the situation was different. In a parallel instance, the colossal bronze statue of General Desaix by Claude Dejoux (1732-1816), represented as a classical nude, was vehe- mently denounced by members of the public when it was unveiled in 1810, and had to be covered up with boards and panels; two years later it was dismantled and melted down.96 The objections were to the idea of a monument to a general in a public square, to the nudity of such a contemporary figure, with its overly exaggerated musculature, and to the size of the monument in relation to its designated space.97 Julien might have known earlier versions of Ganymede, including more than a dozen antique sculptures catalogued by Reinach,98 but he did not turn to these, nor was he drawn to the copies by Laviron and Joly. His obvious source was Francin's version; he could have seen the plaster model or he may even have accompanied Coustou, who supervised Du- pro's completion of the marble statue. The compositions are almost identical, with the same contrapposto and a similar eagle and base of clouds, but Julien's Ganymede does not embrace the eagle. His more muscular, less effeminate</page><page sequence="12">THE IMAGE OF GANYMEDE IN FRANCE 641 youth, without elongated proportions, shows a greater skill in fine carving and an attention to precision of details. Julien added some accessories: a bow, quiver, and a torch burning at both ends. The bow and quiver, not the usual attributes of a shepherd, must indicate Love's proximity. Ganymede was represented only rarely with a bow or arrow-- as, for example, in versions by Damiano Mazza and Rubens (ca. 1635; Madrid, Prado), which featured a prominent, phallic quiver. In the Renaissance, Cupid and Ganymede were closely tied both formally and iconographically, and in scenes with Jupiter kissing Cupid, the eagle, bow, and arrow may all be present. The simple flaming torch has different meanings in the hands of different allegorical figures. It may denote lust and is usually the attribute of Profane Love, signifying the flames of carnal passion. Yet an Eros holding two flaming torches can be interpreted as Spiritual Love chasing away Sensual Love. In addition, a few ancient representations of the rape of Ganymede feature the young Trojan holding a flaming torch, for example, an Etruscan mirror in Rome (first century B.C.; Rome, Villa Giulia). Julien's torch ignited at both ends actually represents a bundle of lightning flashes or a thunderbolt, associated with the force of Love. Ripa explained that Love took the thunderbolt from Jupiter's hands to demonstrate his own power.99 The thunderbolt was a symbol of Jupiter's disguises, and was particularly con- nected to the eagle. In this sense, Julien would be reviving the ancient iconographical symbol of Zeus. His torch clearly derives from the thunderbolt in ancient art, which resembles shafts of wheat, for example, in the Enthroned Zeus in Berlin (Antiken-Sammlung). There are very few examples of this in Renaissance images of Ganymede.0oo These accessories at the base of Julien's statue emphasize the link between Ganymede and Cupid and insinuate the homoerotic essence of the myth. Toward the end of the century there are a few obscure references to images of Ganymede: a terra-cotta sketch by Guillaume Boichot (1735-1814) in the Salon of 1789 (lost);1o0 Jean-Jacques Forty's painting two years later (Salon of 1791, no. 785),102 found by Louis-Abel de Bonafons, known as Abbe de Fontenay (1737-1806), to be lacking in color, but with elegant forms that showed a knowledge of ancient sources;103 the terra-cotta statuette of 1793 by Clodion's most famous student, Joseph-Charles Marin (1759-1834), now in the Mus6e Bonnat, Bayonne (Fig. 8), which has a pendant Hebe; and Antoine Ansiaux's lost painting in the Salon of 1796 (no. 3), a pendant to Hib5 presentant le nectar a" Jupiter (no. 4). Of this group only Marin's work has survived. The standing figure holds a vase in his right hand and leans against a tree stump. Marin chose not to show the eagle at all, thus obscuring the meaning of the myth almost completely. The head is classical but the pose is easy and naturalistic, unlike the pendant, which recalls the elegantly posed Muse Calliope in Poussin's Inspiration du poete dpique in the Louvre (ca. 1629-30). Marin's Ganymede has the angular awkward- ness and the still unformed muscularity so appropriate for an adolescent. The finely articulated hair is one of the sculptor's trademarks that distinguishes his works from Clodion's.104 Finally, we come to four late versions: a lost statue executed by Barthedemy Corneille (ca. 1760-1805) in Flo- rence for the collection of Henri Clarke, duc de Feltre, ca. 1801-5;105 a lost marble statue by Frangois-Dominique- Aim&amp;e Milhomme (1758-1823), dated ca. 1802-8;106 a lost painting by Antoine-Frangois Callet (Salon of 1810, no. 141 );107 andJean-Baptiste Regnault's Enlivement de Ganymlde par Jupiter (Fig. 9), a vividly colored panel in the Mobilier 89.

The indifferent Ganymede smiles pleasantly and stands in a cross-legged position; directly above his head is the eagle. See B.

Paris, Mobilier National (photo: Reunion des Musees Nationaux) National, Paris, from the 1820s, which is one of twenty-four finished sketches after Ovid's Metamorphoses.108 Here the eagle clutches the billowing drapery, and the full-bodied Ganymede holds onto a part of the drapery that loops over the eagle's neck. In this scene of the actual abduction, with Ganymede being carried away to Mount Olympus, we have come full circle from Le Sueur's mid-seventeenth-century version. There was a uniformity of representation in the French tradition from 1644 until 1820, with hardly any reference to classical examples. As noted above, by the end of the century there were objections to the display of nude sculptural figures in open spaces, though behind closed doors such images were sought out; the fact that art lovers crowded into Pajou's studio to see a statue of a nude goddess that was censored by the Church is evidence of this. Furthermore, classical, idealized nude figures came to be regarded as indecent when viewed outside the confines of exhibition halls and private salons. Although some of the Ganymedes in this study were shown in the Salons, they were all commissioned for the intimate, private interiors of the king's buildings, for the chateaux of aristocrats, or for semiprivate gardens where art was safe from censorship by the authorities. A few of the small-scale sculptures were works executed for the artists' own pleasure. It would be interesting to learn more about the patrons and the artists, including their sexual orientations. Of the artists we have surveyed, one might be tempted to hypoth- esize a passionate or sexual relationship between Pierre Julien and Claude Dejoux, who were lifetime companions. Dejoux went to Rome at his own expense with Julien in 1768. Back in Paris they were both agre' in 1778 and received into the Acad6mie in the following year. Later they shared commissions, including ones for sculptural reliefs in Sainte- Genevibve and for statues on the grounds of the Chateau de Betz. The two artists lived together and were seen as Doppelgdinger-sculptors who never left one another's sight.'09 At most, however, one may conclude only that Julien and Dejoux shared that special emotional and sentimental friend- ship that was popular in early Romantic Europe. Further- more, when considering the sexual orientation of artists, one must acknowledge that the preference for a male nude in a work of art involves more than sexual proclivity, as psychologi- cal studies have shown."10 An image of Ganymede, with or without the eagle, might have been interpreted in various ways in eighteenth-century France. The Platonic metaphor was probably unmistakable to erudite connoisseurs, who were familiar with the tradition of Italian humanism. Among the seven examples illustrated, however, there is no evidence for an interpretation of the myth in the Renaissance spirit wherein Ganymede's divine abduction functioned as an allegory of spiritual rapture. Although an eighteenth-century elite may have perceived such an allegory, no written statement of that kind of appreciation has been discovered. On the purely sensual level, certain representations of Ganymede, Hyacinthus, and Cyparissus may have been intended for a gay underground culture. In some of the works examined above, the sexual element would have been obvious to homosexual viewers or to classical scholars, but not to those who were either unaware of the symbolism of the eagle or insensitive to images that might suggest homosexual communion. The French Ganymedes usually feature the attractive adoles- cent accompanied by a relatively innocuous eagle; in the painted versions, however, the animal is huge and overpow- ering. In sculpture in the round the flight of the eagle carrying Ganymede, as in Leochares' famous Urbild, was achieved only rarely. In a few instances art critics equated the story of Ganymede with obscene and abnormal love; to contemporary audiences Julien's eagle seemed especially threatening, and Julien was the only artist who made a specific link to the role of Eros in the story, with the bow, quiver, and flaming thunderbolt. The type of passion repre- 108. The panel measures 81/4 x 61/4 in. (21 x 16 cm), and was number 61 in Regnault's inventory of 1830, which includes twenty-four such sketches. See C.

Machotka, The Nude: Perception and Personal- ity, New York, 1979, found in a small sampling that masculine figures were indicated as preferred aes- thetic objects for many reasons. The male nude was described by respondents as an image of physical strength, authority, and articulateness, expressive of a satisfaction with one's own body and a dislike of forms regarded as "feminine."</page><page sequence="14">THE IMAGE OF GANYMEDE IN FRANCE 643 sented here is plainly what Plato called earthly love, which could have been regarded as obscene. The theme incited moral indignation during the eighteenth century, when homoerotic stories were reinterpreted either heterosexually or in a way that reduced the protagonists to innocent teenagers. It is noteworthy that the Ganymedes considered here show a tender relationship with the eagle, as if there was no violent rape involved and both lover and beloved found pleasure in the sexual encounter. During the Neoclassical period and into the nineteenth century, artists continued to produce images of Ganymede in the Rococo style. These artists survived the attacks of moralistic critics against homoerotic themes by presenting the protagonists as harmless, asexual companions. Yet the art-viewing public seems to have been won over by the moralists-Caylus, Rousseau, and D'Angiviller-who fought with the Church against the allegedly frivolous and erotic scenes of Boucher and his followers. For at the very end of the century, the organizers of the parade of classical statues through the streets of Paris (including the Apollo Belvedere, traditionally regarded as an image of spiritual beauty) were swiftly accused of impropriety. Such an accusation coincided with the despiritualization of the myth of Ganymede: as the ancient Greek concept of love between males as a higher level of passion had become old-fashioned, the idea of classical statues embodying spiritual perfection, as defined by Winckelmann, was beginning to lose its authority.
