<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY These, mostly from the mural paintings, include also comparable details from ceramic and textile designs and other Pueblo source material, all well documented in the accompanying descriptive legends. The space devoted to such an exhaustive analysis is more than justified for the series will be of great value in various studies, not only of the Hopi, but of general Pueblo culture. Leaving the attractive illustrations as a background, the reviewer now turns to Smith's text which deserves even greater space. Throughout its 363 pages, inter- spersed with maps, tables, and figures, he presents systematically every phase of his subject from kiva structure to the possible significance of the most prob- lematical objects portrayed by the muralists. His detailed account of the various means employed in repair, re- moval, and copying of the paintings is in itself a veri- table text book for all who may some day be faced (let us hope) with similar problems. Under the section, "Material Characteristics of the Wall Paintings," the investigation of materials and media employed by the mural artists has brought together much needed infor- mation, and particularly that under the head of Pig- ments. But here Smith is misled by conflicting state- ments concerning a commonly used ingredient in Pueblo ceramics, which he classifies as a black pigment. Briefly stated, the boiled, evaporated, and dried sap of beeweed (Cleome serrulata) does harden, like licorice, into a black cake. But when it is redissolved for use it varies, according to its density, from light to dark brown, and when applied to a clayey surface it dries as a slightly glossy, translucent brown. Thus its only use in mural painting would be as a "vehicle or binder" as described, pp. 30, 31. In his analysis of layouts, patterns and design ele- ments the author first assigns his material to four fairly distinct groups, ". . . without regard to time sequence, either known or imputed, but solely on the design features implicit within the paintings themselves." Under these categories he lists and discusses the structural characteristics peculiar to each, and also the objects portrayed. For instance, in Group I we find the extreme of static, bilateral symmetry, while II is characterized by dynamic unbalance. Of I the author says, p. 119: While there is often no close approach to actual detailed sym- metry, there is apparent a very decided and consciously evolved intent to build up the design about a large central figure, and to arrange the minor figures and incidental details around it in such a manner that they will appear in compensation to each other at right and left of the central rhotive. And of II he continues, p. 135: The static rigidity of Group I is quite lacking, and the larger figures, whether anthropomorphic or zoomorphic, are usually in a state of dynamic motion. The placidity and permanence of the figures of Group I, which give many of them the character of a tableau, are quite absent; on the contrary, in Group II the figures seem to be in vigorous movement, even though they may have been momentarily arrested like a moving picture film. Whereas the stories told by the Group I paintings are complete, those of the designs in Group II are, as it were, still in the process of de- velopment. Foremost in human interest are the many remarkable anthropomorphs with elaborate ceremonial costumes and headdress. Next in importance are birds, mammals and other life forms, as well as ceremonial objects, among which stylized feathers abound. Following this comes a most searching presentation of the ceremonial significance of the material in which the author points out the many resemblances to the masked kachinas and unmasked personages surviving in the rituals of the Hopi and other pueblos of today. There follows also a well considered section on Symbolism with a discussion of many unwarranted interpretations associated with the term. Finally in a comparative study of the paintings in relation to the ceramics of the Hopi and adjacent areas, Smith has gathered very convincing evidence of a paral- lel development in the design styles of the two media, the most spectacular of which is that of the Sikyatki and San Bernardo wares. This is further confirmed by tree-ring evidence covering much of the period from circa 1372 to 1630, the apparent date of abandonment of the latest kivas. But, though the mural art extended well into the post-Spanish period, it is purely aboriginal in content, without the slightest trace of European contact. In all, Watson Smith's work is an outstanding contribution to knowledge, not only of prehistoric mural painting as a craft, but also of the many interrelated phases of early Hopi culture, both material and non- material, which the paintings faithfully record. KENNETH M. CHAPMAN Laboratory of Anthropology Santa Fe, New Mexico. The Coville Rock Shelter, Inyo County, California. CLEMENT W. MEIGHAN. Publications in Anthropo- logical Records, Volume 12:5, University of California Press, Berkeley. 1952. pp. 171-215, 3 maps, 5 plates. $1.00. The Coville rockshelter is in Death Valley National Monument, in the side of a small canyon in the Pana- mint Mountains "roughly halfway between Ubehebe Crater and Ubehebe Mountain" and about 150 feet above the canyon floor. The original limestone cave was about 45 feet across the face and 15 feet deep, but a fall of rocks from the roof before occupation be- gan reduced the available area to about 15 feet at one end and 12 feet at the other. The excavation of the cave was carried out in June and July, 1951, as a cooperative project by the University of California and the National Park Service. The cave is dry and the preservation of materials is good. The entire deposit was removed by trowelling by 6 inch levels and screened through a 1/4 inch mesh. A sterile 24 inch bottom layer was overlaid by occupation material mixed with rocks and dust. This was a few inches deep at the outer edge of the cave increasing to 40 inches at the rear. After the usual introductory materials the report moves to a functional description of the artifacts.

A section on Ecological Factors follows and then the Conclusion. Appendixes A-E give information on Minor Sites, Cordage, Mammal Remains, Plant Ma- terials and Nonartifact Remains, and a Descriptive Table of Specimens. There is a bibliography, explana- tion of plates, and plates 25-29. A total of 366 artifacts was recovered but they showed no change in type throughout the use of the cave. Of the total, 115 were basketry and 125 cordage. On the basis of the similarity of the artifacts to the ethno- graphic specimens from the region, the lack of "Cauca- sian materials" and some "degradation of the surface" of the site, the author assigns a tentative terminal date of A.D. 1750 for the cave. In view of the lack of change in the artifact types, a relatively short period of time is postulated for the use of the cave and an initial date of A.D. 1450 estimated. To sum up the statements presented this far, the Coville Rock Shelter shows some connections with the Southwest (slab-lined cists, two-rod-and-bundle coiling), a large number with the Great Basin, and virtually none with California. The culture may be defined as typically Great Basin of the protohistoric period, with slight evidence of some Southwestern connection. (p. 189) In the areal and temporal comparisons the author is faced with a problem that is not of his making, namely the lack of knowledge of the depth perspective of the ethnographic horizons with which comparisons must be made, lack of archaeological data for comparison, and lack of actual and relative dates on the archaeological materials that are available. Another factor that compli- cates the problem of fixing the temporal and spatial relationships of the site is the marginal character of the cave and our lack of knowledge of the dynamics of the culture in this kind of a situation. Cross-dating, at best, is a tricky procedure that involves a lot of assumptions. From an organizational point of view it would seem preferable to have put the section on ecological descrip- tions at the beginning of the study as a frame of refer- ence rather than just before the conclusions. No vertical scale is shown on the profile, Map 3. A scale, such as a levelling rod, in the photograph of the profile, Plate 29L, would make the illustration more meaningful. A scale included in the photographs of artifacts rather than, as in this paper, a statement of size in the descrip- tion of plates, facilitates the use of a publication. The use of the word "house-pit" to describe the occupational areas in the cave, when the author states that there is no evidence that there actually were house pits in the cave, leads to possible confusion in the use of this publication for distributional studies. The distribution of compound arrows (cane shaft and hardwood fore- shaft) should have included the northern Great Basin in the area for these artifacts. Twined basketry on the basis of the pitch of the weft element has characteristic areas of distribution, an areal feature which could have been used to good effect in this study. The author's handling of coiled basketry (Appendix E, Table 3, p. 209) is a confusion of the terms for weaving and coiling. He uses the terms weft and warp apparently for splint and foundation elements respec- tively. The words warp and weft apply to weaving in its different forms, a process that is entirely different from the sewing technique used in coiled basketry. An examination of Mason's classical work on Aboriginal American Basketry and Morris and Burgh's Anasazi Basketry would indicate quite clearly the terminology that is correct in each case. As the latter authors state, there is still some discrepancy in the terminology used in the description of basketry but the fundamental differences between the two basic kinds are well recog- nized. One wonders, then, why this confusion should appear in this study. L. S. CRESSMAN University of Oregon Eugene, Oregon. 91</page></plain_text>
