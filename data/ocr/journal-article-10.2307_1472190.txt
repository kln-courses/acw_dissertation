This has been developed to the greatest extent in the United States. The last chapter "Significant Changes And Trends in the Teaching of Mathematics in the United States" by Reeve is one that should be carefully read not only by teachers of mathe- matics but by any one interested in elementary and secondary education. HAROLD A. EDOERTON. HIGHER EDUCATION MORRIS, JOHN T. Considerations in Establish- ing a Junior College. New York: Teachers College, Columbia University, 1929. 63 pp. (Teachers College, Columbia University, Con- tributions to Education, No. 343) A special study has been made relative to the establishment of a junior college at Mount Pleas- ant Classical and Scientific Institute in Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania. The investigation deals with the economic conditions, the social-racial features, and the extent to which the commu- nity is supporting higher education. The re- quirements and purposes of the junior college are first set down, together with an analysis of the particular relationships which these bear to higher education in Pennsylvania. Population trends and industrial conditions are analyzed. One of the important chapters of the report deals with the trends in high-school and college enrollment in that state. Recommendations are offered in the final chapter relative to the specific problem. RHUE E. GREEN GOOD, CARTER V. Teaching in College and University. Baltimore: Warwick and York, 1929. xi + 557 pp. The rapidly accumulating body of literature bearing on college problems and the reorganiza- tions and changes that have taken place in this field in recent years make highly desirable a careful biographical survey of the field of higher education. Such is the nature of the valuable study prepared by Dr. Good. The author has made a careful examination and evaluation of all the educational literature in this field during the last decade. The first two chapters serve as an orientation to the student in the field of higher education. Much valuable source material is given together with a brief survey of the present status of colleges, teachers, and students. The remaining chapters deal with the following important prob- lems: objectives and standards, curriculum, psychology of learning, instruction, measure- ment and guidance. The last chapter sum- marizes recent attempts to improve instruction in higher education. There is also an appendix containing bibliographies of special method, the curriculum, and other problems in twelve subject- matter fields. Teaching in College and University is an attractive volume, readable and well organized. The bibliographies are comprehensive and com- plete. The book is an invaluable reference work, not only for the occasional reader, but also for the research worker in this field. W. F. SANDERS MISCELLANY THORNDIKE, EDWARD L.; BREGMAN, ELSIE 0., TILTON, J. WARREN; AND WOODYARD, ELLA. Adult Learning. New York: Macmillan Com- pany, 1928. x + 323 pp. Thorndike, in his Adult Learning, discusses the old question of whether the learning of infancy, childhood, and adolescence has, by vir- tue of original nature, any advantage over the learning of adults between the ages of twenty to forty. The results of his experiments flatly contradict the general belief that children learn more easily than adults. As Thorndike himself reports, his'facts show that adults can learn rather easily and rapidly and probably could learn much more than they do. This is true not only of adults of superior intellect but also of adults of inferior intellect. In both cases the curve of ability to learn from twenty-two to forty-two shows a very slow decline. The book has a decided significance for adult education. Adults can no longer defend them- selves by saying that they cannot learn as easily as children. Thorndike states, "They could learn much more than they do." Then why don't they? There are probably several reasons: (1) adults have less time for learning because of economic pressure; (2) their desire to learn is not strong enough; (3) very little social pressure is brought to bear on adults while it bears rather heavily on children. The question of adult learning bears directly upon the progress of our civilization. If adults do not learn or learn only with difficulty, this means lack of flexibility and a static civilization. On the other hand, the facts of Adult Learning should encourage industry to face changes in machinery and processes. FLORENCE J. MORGAN FORBES, CLARENCE A. Greek Physical Educa- tion. New York: Century Company, 1929. vi + 300 pp. In recent decades a large body of sources, especially inscriptions and papyri, which bear upon ancient life and education have been dis- covered.

BRUCE essays, all but one of which have been reprinted from other sources; consequently it offers no new theories with which the disciples of Alfred North Whitehead are not already familiar. The essays do, however, make a splendid exposition of the ideas which have marked the author as a great thinker and a liberal educator. "You may not divide the seamless coat of learning." That is the central thesis which runs through the book and which is demonstrated most clearly in the three chapters on the classics in education, the mathematics curriculum, and the place of technical education. Mr. White- head insists that the educated man must possess power of thought, power of action, and the imaginative initiative of art-all three. Three of the essays are distinctly the mathe- matician's treatment of "The Organization of Thought," "The Anatomy of. Some Scientific Ideas," and "Space, Time, and Relativity." DAISY B.

Norton, 1929. ix + 443 pp. This is a new edition of the work published in 1925, with the first chapter completely re- written and minor corrections made throughout the volume. As the spectator of all time and all existence the philosopher must sooner or later give his view of the ultimate background of human life. Dewey has been so deeply con- cerned with distinctly human problems that it has not always seemed clear just what his metaphysical position was. This work comes nearer to an answer to this question. In his metaphysics he is a "Naturalist." But this term must not be taken as equivalent to "Materialist." Materialism is non-humanistic and finally pessimistic. Dewey is neither. The problem of life is the creation of value, and for human beings this means human value. Nature offers the raw material and the instruments for this creation. Nature is the mother of us all, and in her bosom we are nurtured. However, this does not warrant anthropomorphism, even of an idealisitic sort. Nature can become human, but it has not become merely that. On systematic classification in terms of traditional schools Dewey is very reserved. But the human has its place in the scheme of things, and we must concern ourselves with 307</page></plain_text>
