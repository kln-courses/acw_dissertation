Indeed, these represent the only inroads of research on algal ecology, a subject which has been generally ignored for its lack of obvious impact on the affairs of man. The papers of L. A. Whitford and John L. Blum present classical algal ecology, the associations of algae found in any one site at various seasons, and their correlations with range of temperature and light intensity, nutrient supply, and current. The ecological importance of the world distribution of algae and their methods of survival are only briefly mentioned by WVhitford. Experimental procedures are almost totally absent within this field, and fre- quently descriptive material has incorporated terms from land ecology without sufficient thought as to their applicability. As Blum points out, in the mi- croclimates of streams, where environmental con- ditions can change drastically in a matter of days, it seems pointless to speak of typical successions or of climax associations. The intereffects of algae and their neighbors form the subject of papers by G. W. Prescott and Richard T. Hartman. What is known of the factors controlling algal blooms is discussed, and examples of algal poisoning, antibiotic action, and apparent interspecies antagonism or enhancement are sum- marized. The final paper concerned primarily witb freshwater algae is that of Alfred F. Bartsch of the U. S. Public Health Service. The problems and im- portance of algae in controlling stream pollution and waste disposal by their production of photo- synthetic oxygen are presented here. John H. Ryther, in his paper assessing the or- ganic contribution of marine plankton, includes a number of fairly free but entirely reasonable cal- culations of algal production. These make clear that although the total plant biomass of the land may be as much as a thousand times that of the sea, the annual net production of organic matter in these two major environments may be about equal. However, from the anthropomorphic point of view, much of the annual marine production must be considered a total loss, for in tropical areas of rapid turnover algae may grow and die many times without contributing to any food chain which leads to man. The final paper, by L. Provasoli and I. J. Pintner, discusses the constitution and suitability of artificial media for the growth of both fresh and marine al- gae. Years of empirical research in this field are summarized by the authors in their discussion of major nutrients, trace elements and chelation, vita- min requirements, and buffers. For the most part, the state of algal ecology has been well described by Prescott in the following words: "the surface film over a great sea of igno- rance has been punctured only in a few places." The Pymatuning Symposia may perhaps lead to a remedy of this situation. ANNETTE W. COLEMAN</page></plain_text>
