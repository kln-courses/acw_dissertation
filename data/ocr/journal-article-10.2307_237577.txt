As Stephen Jay Gould and others have already pointed out, the study of the brain was closely linked with ques- tions of anthropology. Gould emphasizes the comparative dimension of anthropology and its connections to racism; Hagner investigates as well the role of brain research in philosophical speculations about the nature of man throughout the three centuries he covers. Phrenology and ro- mantic Naturphilosophie are just two of the off- shoots of such speculations that he examines in some detail. Hagner also explains the effects of the different scientific methodologies of anat- omy, physiology, and pathology on representa- tions of the brain as an epistemic object. In this context his discussions of how an emphasis on ideal experiments at various times prevented progress in nineteenth-century neurophysiology and how the differences between the qualitative, case-history-based approach of clinicians and the quantitative method of anatomists and phys- iologists led to rather different conceptions of "localization" are particularly revealing. Hagner's book is extremely informative and highly original in its emphasis on the brain as an epistemic object suspended in a web of cultural and technical considerations. Further, its lucid albeit Germanic prose is a pleasure to read. Homo Cerebralis will therefore be of interest not only to the specialist but also to a wider audi- ence, who will surely benefit from this challeng- ing account of a subject that has such an enor- mous appeal. Given the unfortunate decline in the knowledge of foreign languages in the United States, Hagner's book should be trans- lated into English promptly. A new edition of Homo Cerebralis would also be a welcome op- portunity to include illustrations and figures. The absence of illustrations is about the only thing that one can criticize in this otherwise excellent book. MANFRED D. LAUBICHLER Marco Beretta. Il tesoro della salute: Dall'onnipotenza dei semplici all'atomizzazione delfarmaco. 93 pp., illus., bibl. Florence: Giunti Gruppo Editoriale, 1997. (Paper.) This volume is a product of "The Treasure of Health: From the Omnipotence of Simples to the Atomization of Medicine," an exhibition held in Milan in February and March 1997. Marco Be- retta, through a careful reconstruction of events and the use of a rich iconography, traces the his- tory of chemical and pharmaceutical research from the beginnings of pharmacy up to the nine- teenth century. Pharmaceutical work dates back to the crea- tion of botanical gardens, where doctors-in consultation with herbalists-could choose me- dicinal plants and observe their effects. Later, pharmaceutical laboratories used the tools and technologies of the day to prepare new mixtures and substances. The creation and spread of phar- macopoeias and prescription books facilitated the expansion of pharmaceutical research. Thereafter, the introduction of iatrochemistry and advances in chemistry, comparative anat- omy, and physiology led to the discovery of more and more effective remedies. From the eighteenth century on, pharmacology became primarily a chemical doctrine. Beretta focuses on the discovery of new chem- ical treatments by D. MacBride and I. Beddoes, M. Wells, J. von Liebig, C. Bernard, L. Pasteur, R. Bucheim, and P. Ehrlich. He stresses the im- portance of statements about frauds and quacks, such as those made by the Austrian physician F. A. Messner. Beretta attributes recognition of the importance of systematic experimentation, teamwork, and laboratory diversification to Ehr- lich, highlighting the economic potential of the industrial exploitation of pharmaceutical re- search. At the beginning of the twentieth century the first industrial laboratories for research and pro- duction were created, among them the Institut fur Serumforschung und Serumprufung, the Georg-Speyer-Haus fur Chemiotherapie (which produced Salvarsan), Bayer (aspirin), Schering (urotropine), CIBA, Kern and Sandoz Chemical Works, Geigy, Hoffman la Roche, and, in Italy, the Carlo Erba, Biochimica Zanardi, and Zam- bon facilities. Despite the development of indus- trial pharmacology, however, patients still trusted traditional preparations, as the many pharmacopoeias used into this century attest. The historical narrative ends with a descrip- tion of the work of Paul Ehrlich. An interesting appendix offers a chronology of pharmaceutical research from 1480 (the first printed edition of the Regimen sanitatis) to 1928 (the discovery of penicillin). The 109 illustrations, some in color, repro- duce old prescription books and pharmaco- poeias, manuscripts, and old prints; they make this volume interesting and valuable. The origi- nals come from various institutions: the Uppsala University Library, the Istituto e Museo de Sto- ria delle Scienze (Florence), the Museo dell'Accademia di Storia dell'Arte Sanitaria (Rome), the Archives de l'Academie des Sci- 141</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS-ISIS, 91: 1 (2000) ences (Paris), the Central National Library of Bologna, and the Medicine History Library (Co- penhagen). The bibliography contains citations to eighty-five important publications pertaining to the history of pharmacy and medicine. ENRICO CINGOLANI Stewart Elliott Guthrie. Faces in the Clouds: A New Theory of Religion. xii + 290 pp., fron- tis., illus., bibl., index. New York/Oxford: Ox- ford University Press, 1993. $17.95 (paper). In the first chapter of Faces in the Clouds, Stew- art Guthrie distinguishes three types of human- istic theories of religion: religion as wish fulfill- ment, as social glue, and as a primitive science. The first two theories are inadequate, as religions may in fact fuel anxiety and social divisiveness. Hence, in Guthrie's view religion is not a matter of emotion, morality, or social function; rather, religions are to be understood as attempts to in- terpret the world. Guthrie, then, sees religion as a cognitive enterprise, like science and the ex- ercise of common sense, although more deeply dependent upon anthropomorphisms than these. The next five chapters are not about religion but about the tendency to "anthropomorphize"- to see faces in the clouds, for example, or pun- ishments in accidents, or purpose behind illness (p. viii). Animism and anthropomorphism, both of which "credit our environment with more or- ganization and more organisms than it has" (p. 39), are not accidental mistakes but effective strategies for dealing with uncertainty in percep- tion. They focus on that which-if correct-mat- ters most to the perceiver; for example, Guthrie examines at some length explanations that see comfort or familiarity as the source of anthro- pomorphism, but such alternatives are unsatis- factory. He discusses at some length too the arts and the history of the sciences (e.g., "attraction") and of philosophy. Although philosophers and scientists have repeatedly sought to expel an- thropomorphism (consider Bacon's criticisms of the idols of the tribe), it keeps cropping up in their writings. Religions anthropomorphize in at- tributing human characteristics to gods or to na- ture. Theologians have objected to this human habit because it threatens the transcendence at- tributed to God or may undermine belief in the objective existence of a god. Guthrie offers an interesting and energetically defended antidote to the common understanding of religion as, pri- marily, noncognitive. Anyone with an interest in the history of an- thropology, religious studies, or the philosophy of religion will, in particular, find this book worth reading. And as the history of science is also the history of the way science became a dis- tinct enterprise, well demarcated from religion and from other enterprises, the historian of sci- ence may also benefit from this book, especially from its discussion of the various ways in which religion is understood. By emphasizing percep- tion and cognition as common ground, Guthrie locates religion far closer to science than do many others who emphasize emotion or moral- ity. WILLEM B. DREES Mark Stoll. Protestantism, Capitalism, and Na- ture in America. xii + 276 pp., bibl. index. Al- buquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1997. $40 (cloth); $19.96 (paper). In his essay "The Historical Roots of Our Eco- logic Crisis" (1967), Lynn White, jr., argued that Christian dogma was in large part responsible for the sorry ecological mess that we humans have made of the Western world. Christianity, unlike ancient paganism, for example, posited the man/ nature dualism, insisting that humans dominate and exploit the natural world for their own ends. The instrumental assumptions at the root of Christian theology, goes the argument, were used as the pretext for the rank exploitation of nature. In his new book Mark Stoll offers a rather different perspective on the role of religion in our conversation with nature. Evangelical Prot- estantism, he claims, played a key role in in- spiring capitalist domination of nature, to be sure. But it also emerged as a critical force in shaping the worldview and actions of those in- volved in efforts to conserve nature. "It is a cu- rious fact of American history," writes Stoll, "that the people who dominated the early, for- mative years of both capitalism and environ- mentalism grew up with the same cultural and religious values" (p. ix). Ultimately, he con- cludes, the pursuit of money and concern for ecology both have their roots in the Protestant tradition. Stoll provides a set of short biographies fo- cusing on the role of religion, nature, and capi- talism in the lives of such figures as Anne Brad- street, Cotton Mather, Benjamin Franklin, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, proceeding sequentially through time to the present and ending with James Watt and Dave Foreman (of Earth First!). His goal is to tease out for readers the strain of evangelical Protestantism that informed the 142</page></plain_text>
