Under movement, the daily and sea- sonal aetivities are deseribed. Here are found two exeellent eurves showing the seasonal movements for bueks and does. In the eurve of buek move- ments, Mr. Prior shows something he refers to as "post rut wandering." Aeeording to this, the adult bueks leave their normal loeality and move into outlying erops for a short period in September. Orle ean easily get sueh an impression at this time sinee the bueks' territories, following the rut, dis- solve very rapidly. Consequently, the animals feel less attaehed in their movements and are again more free to move between eaeh other. The re- viewer, at first, gained the same impression from similar detailed observations of roe deer in Den- mark. But after the deer were marked with large, numbered plates, whieh allowed a elose eheek on the movements of the individual animals, it be- eame evident that sueh wandering rarely oeeurs. Mr. Prior distinguished between individual axiimals on the basis of natural marks, sueh as antlers and the like. Sueh eriteria are hardly suffieiently eer- tain to enable differentiation of individual move- ments and may aeeount for this assumed "post rut wandering." In the following two ehapters, voiee and feeding are treated. Then follow deseriptions of the estab- lishment of territory and the rut. These are prob- ably the most important ehapters in the book as far as the understanding of the funetion of a roe deer eommunity is eoneerned. Chapters on fawn- ing, antlers, weight and pelage, age determination, eensus, population strueture and density, manage- ment and eulling make up the remaining portion of the book. Even though one may disagree with the author on eertain details, the general impres- sion remains that this is an excellent work. If the book is regarded as a seientifie work, whieh is apparently not what the author has in- tended, there are reasons to make a few general objeetions. First, the stated doeumentation does not enable the reader to perform an independent evaluation. Furthermore, it is often diffieult to distinguish between faets and the author's as- sumptions. One example is "Estimating the Age of Living Roe," whieh begins on page 130. The author states that it is possible to age a living animal with some eertainty on the basis of criteria such as body fullness, erection, way of movement, and an≈ìders, but there is no substantia- tion that the elaimed eriteria are eorreet. In an- other ease, in the chapter titled "Census,'&gt; the author states elearly the diffieulffes that are eon- neeted with estimation of the size of a population with only approximate certainty. Thereafter, he states that by elose observation of the bucks, it is possible to learn their number, and one is then able to ealeulate the size of the population from knowledge of the sex ratio. While the method may be reliable, proof is missing, and when the author gives an example (page 147) of how, one evening, he shot a known buck and the following morning he met another one exactly like it, which he also shot, shortcomings of the system appear obvious. Mr. Prior has shown that it is possible, by inten- sive observations, to learn to know one's animals to a very high degree and thereby to give an eminent account of the life of roe deer. There is little doubt that the general results he has arrived at are correct to a large extent. At the same time however, it must be stated that the documenta- tion which is necessary in a scientific work is hardly satisfied. This can mainly be ascribed to the fact that the animals were not marked sufficiently in order to know the individuals with certainty. The appendLx includes a chapter by Dr. A. McDiarmid on parasites and diseases of roe deer. This topic falls outside the purview of the re- viewer, and its existence is only mentioned here.- H.

Lippincott GompanyS Phila delphia and New York. 1968* 192pp. $5.95 "The World of the Canada Goose&gt; is Joe Van- Wormer's latest contribuffon to the "Living World Books" series. It was written to give the adult lay reader a close look at the natural history of this fascinating bird. The book starts with an introduction to Canada geese that is an interesting mixture of biology, folklore and history. The author then devotes about two-thirds of the book to a chronological review of the bird's life history. He traces in detail its activities from spring migration through the nesting season and into the fall and winter periods. I was favorably impressed with the technical quality of the introduction and the four chapters devoted to the seasonal biology and behavior of Canada geese. The author has drawn heavily upon the literature and his extensive personal experienee to present an accurate and complete picture in words that are easily understood. The few errors noted were largely a matter of improper emphasis. For example, ffie author states that most Canadas in the Adantic Flyway, winter in coastal wetlands from Delaware through North Carolina and into northern Florida. This is true, but the number of Canadas wintering south of the Delmarva Peniilsula is decreasing an important change not readily apparent from the author's comment. Later he suggests that most Canadas nesting in the heartland of Canada follow a fall migration route just east of the Rocky Mountains</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 1051 without reservation for the layman and for profes- sionals not closely associated with goose matters.- GEORGE K.

Dutton &amp; Co., New York. 1968. l91pp.; one map; 28 photographs. $5.95. Ian McMillan is a rancher living in the Salinas Valley Oll the edge of the present range of the California Condor. Since boyhood he and his brother Eban have shared a keen interest in these gigantic birds and the wild and rugged wilderness areas responsible for their survival. In 196&gt;64, they were engaged by the Audubon Society to reappraise the status of the condor to determine what changes might have occurred since the find- ings of Koford in the 1940&gt;s. This book is an interesting account of their field survey, together with an extensive review of the early history of the species and of the many factors involved in the long and rather discouraging campaign to save it from extinction It seems that condors were never abundant, even in prehistoric times. Primitive man captured them for use in ceremonial rituals during which the birds were killed and the skin and feathers retained. Mc- Millan speculates that this intense persecution by man may have been the principal factor in shaping the evolution of the condor so that it can breed successfully only in remote wilderness areas free of human intrusion. In historic times the range of the species has rapidly constricted before the onslaughts of the white man with his guns, poison baits, and bulldozers. Lack of carrion is not considered a factor in the decline of the condor, since dead sheep and cattle occur in the area in abundant supply. Illegal shooting is still the principal factor in reducing the population of condors, but urban sprawl and expanding recreational activities in wilderness areas pose serious threats. The inept administration of the condor refuges by U. S. Forest Service officials, as documented by McMillan, indicates the need for drastic action at the federal level if these birds are to survive. A recent drive to have a dam built in Sespe Canyon, within ie condor refuge, was defeated in 1967, but the forces of &lt;&lt;progress" will no doubt return to this with increasing vigor. I strongly recommend this book to anyone with a serious interest in wildlife and wilderness conser- vation.-GEORGE E. HUDSON, Department of Zoology, Washington State University Pullman. Far more of these birds migrate down the eastern part of the Central Flyway and through the Mississippi Flyway. He also states that most "small" Canadas in the Central Flyway, winter on the Gulf Coast of Texas and Mexico. Many of them do, but an important number also winter in Colorado, Oklahoma, New lHexico, and upstate r s exas. The life history portion of the book is followed by an interesting chapter on the future of Canada geese. Goose managers generally agree that the bird's future is indeed bright. The breeding grounds are lightly stocked and, at the moment, they are not seriously threatened by man The birds have a great ability to survive. Hunting is an important factor) but it is the one most easily controlled by managers. There are serious prob- lems related to distribution and harvest, but these are far more likely to be solved than are the problems created by dwindling or deteriorating habitat. A number of technical errors were found in this chapter. On page 158, the author referred to the "substantial" breeding goose population at Horicon Refuge in Wisconsin, where none exists, and ignored the important nesting flocks at Seney Refuge in M;chigan. In the next paragraph, he suggests that full-winged young geese returned to the Trimble Management Area in Missouri to nest when, in factX they never left. On the following page, he stated that fewer than 30,000 Canadas remained in the Mississippi Valley Population in 1946. The accuracy of inventories in those years was not as great as todaya but most managers agree that the low point in 1946 was Ilear 50,000 birds. These are small errors in an otherwise fine evaluation of the history, status, and future of Canada geese. Perhaps more emphasis should have been placed on the concept of management by populations, and upon some of the more so- phisticated goose management techniques now being used The roll private individuals have played in goose management should have been recognized. The book ends with a brief entry into the field of sub-specific determination. The author has been careful in this area of great disagreement. He identifies in a general way the eleven subspecies recognized by most biologists. The author has bridged the gap which often exists between the scientific writer and the curious reading public. His writing style is personal with- out being anthropomorphic. He communicates ef- fectively and clearly. The book is well organized and well illustrated with 149 excellent photo- graphs. I enjoyed reading it, and recommend it</page></plain_text>
