But of course the transformation of poetry into a slogan has its costs. Tennyson's phrase has been profoundly di- minished by the effacement of its original context - in particular, by the neglect of the fundamental poetic device within which the phrase functions. Tennyson's "Nature," so commonly invoked as a transparent scientific con- cept, appears in the famous sections 55 and 56 of In Memoriam (1850) as a personification - an extended, strikingly elaborate personification of the world-image Tennyson derived from contemporary science. Curiously, this fact is almost never remarked upon by commentators. Perhaps the feature seems unremarkable, since the idea of Nature is so deeply engrained in West- ern culture and its languages as a feminine agent with volition and purpose. Yet the very point of Tennyson's personification is to unsettle this traditional figuration. His Nature remains feminine, to be sure, yet his night thoughts on modem science are focused by the dread that the character of this feminine being has changed utterly - that "Mother Nature" has become a mocking, savage oxymoron. Tennyson's personification of nature, so often cited to illustrate the impact of science on religious faith, thus suggests that evolutionary speculation also rendered newly problematic a deeply traditional and comforting archetype of womanhood. In registering this disturbance, the "scientific" sections of In Memoriam suggest an important relation between science and gender not only in Tennyson's poetry but throughout early Victorian discourse. It is a relation articulated by Darwin (albeit more obliquely) when he, too, acknowledges new pressures on traditional figurations of Nature. Responding to critics who complained of his figurative language in The Origin of Species, Darwin pro- tested, "It is hard to avoid personifying the word Nature" - a somewhat im- patient objection, it might seem, but one which goes to the heart of debates about the very concept of nature. 1 Darwin's theory ostensibly dealt a final 1 The remark was inserted in the third edition (1861): Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species: A Vari- orum Edition, ed.

Adams blow to anthropomorphic understandings of the natural world - and hence to personifications of Nature - yet in the famous work setting forth that the- ory Darwin clearly and persistently depicts the natural world as a feminine, nurturing being. To be sure, anthropomorphism had been logically suspect at least since the rise of Baconian empiricism, which rejected the notion of final cause in scientific explanation, and Darwin was hardly the first scientist to fail to live up to the descriptive norms of a thoroughgoing positivism. Yet in light of the growing authority of this skeptical tradition - of which the Origin is in some respects a culmination - personifications of Nature increasingly come to represent a reactionary, even archaic mode of discourse. Tennyson's trope in particular can be viewed as a desperate effort to humanize the results of sci- ence by envisioning nature even in its bleakest aspects as a conscious, design- ing being, however perverse. In representing an older, anthropocentric worldview, however, the personification also allowed Tennyson to contem- plate the destruction of that older view as a transformation in conceptions of gender. To question the nature of "Nature" as In Memoriam does is inescapa- bly to question the nature of woman. More precisely, it is to ask what has become of those conventionally feminine attributes that have so long distin- guished "Mother Nature."2 Throughout history, of course, the "conventionally feminine" has been constructed antithetically. There is no figurative image of woman, Simone de Beauvoir has contended, that does not immediately evoke its op- posite. 3 Indeed, the archetypal doubleness of the feminine (and hence of Na- ture) clearly informs a work by one of Tennyson's contemporaries that may well have suggested the figure of "Nature, red in tooth and claw." In the chapter of Past and Present (1843) entitled "The Sphinx," Carlyle proclaimed that Nature, like the Sphinx, is of womanly celestial loveliness and tenderness: the face and bosom of a goddess, but ending in claws and the body of a lioness. There is in her a celes- tial beauty . . but there is also a darkness, a ferocity, fatality, which are infernal .... Answer her riddle, it is well with thee. Answer it not, pass on regarding it not, it will answer itself; the solution is a thing of teeth and claws. 4 By virtue of the desire invested in the image of nature as a maternal agency, the image always holds in reserve a terrible double associated with the with- drawal of that agency. But such doubleness (and duplicity) seems to have 2 For a brief historical survey of the concept of Mother Nature, see Carolyn Merchant, The Death of Nature: Woman, Ecology, and the Scientific Revolution (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1983), pp. 1-41. Merchant locates "the death of Nature" conceived as a nurturing mother in the seventeenth century, when an organic theory of the earth gave way to a mechanistic model. Yet the appeal within scientific discourse to a maternal Nature persists at least into the early Victorian period: see Susan Gliserman, "Early Victorian Science Writers and Tennyson's In Memoriam: A Study in Cul- tural Exchange," Victorian Studies 18 (1975), 277-308 and 437-460. 3 Simone de Beauvoir, The Second Sex, trans. and ed.

VICTORIAN STUDIES 8</page><page sequence="3">WOMAN RED IN TOOTH AND CLAW become an especially urgent and threatening reality in early Victorian dis- course, which shaped the long gestations of both In Memoriam and The Origin of Species, as well as the feverish production of Past and Present. On the one hand, during the 1830s and '40s, conservative voices in the debate over woman's place - such as Sarah Ellis, author of the immensely popular Women of England (1837) - were codifying an ideal of womanhood as a quasi-redemptive agency that operated almost entirely within the sphere of maternity and domestic life. Woman's very being, it seemed, was constituted by her role of tending to the physical and emotional needs of men and child- ren. 5 This is precisely the maternal ideal which Tennyson's Nature con- founds - and from which that figure would have drawn a special power to disturb its original audience. Of course the very fervor with which mother- hood is celebrated in this period makes plain the role of the ideal as a response to a wealth of adversarial forces. 6 But Tennyson's poetry, like Dar- win's science, reminds us that the maternal ideal assumes its urgency in Vic- torian culture at the same moment that the claims of science are finally undermining one of the culture's most powerful icons of maternity: the very conception of nature as Mother Nature. Hence it is that Tennyson's poetry can articulate a direct and substantial bond between evolutionary science and an image that, in its subversion of the domestic ideal of womanhood, haunts the Victorian consciousness: the figure of the femme fatale or demonic woman. 7 In personifying nature, Tennyson envisions the subversion of the maternal archetype as an act of feminine betrayal. When Nature's maternal solicitude gives way to indifference, the male poet regards the withdrawal as an act of open hostility toward mankind. This startling metamorphosis of a feminine Nature defines a powerful congruence between In Memoriam and The Princess, the latter of which is largely constructed around Tennyson's association of evolutionary nature with feminine betrayal. But I also will suggest, in a more speculative vein, 5 "The angel in the house" was not one half of a simple dualism. In The Woman Question: Society and Literature in Britain and America, 1837-1883, 3 vols. (New York: Garland, 1983), III, xiv-xv, Eliza- beth Helsinger, Robin Lauterbach Sheets, and William Veeder distinguish at least four "myths" of the feminine: 1) the Angel in the House; 2) the Angel out of the House (the model of which would become Florence Nightingale); 3) an "apocalyptic" feminism, which looked to woman's nature for a redemption of the world; 4) the model of complete equality. For my purposes, however, it is im- portant that the second and third models can be seen as in large part a simple extension of the do- mestic ideal to a wider sphere, within which woman remains distinguished as a nurturing being; the radical model of equality, as the authors point out, played a much smaller role in the debate. 6 The mere fact that it seemed necessary to spell out a position like that of Ellis, as Ray Strachey pointed out in The Cause (1928), in itself reveals undercurrents of resistance to "the duty of female submissiveness which before had been entirely taken for granted" (quoted in Wendell Stacy John- son, Sex and Marriage in Victorian Poetry [Ithaca: Corell University Press, 1975], p. 28). 7 The two terms are notoriously elusive, as is the phenomenon they are invoked to describe. Broadly speaking, I use the two terms interchangeably to denote an image of a woman who repudiates the nurturing, maternal qualities of the domestic ideal of femininity ("the angel in the house") and thereby strikes the male observer as enigmatic and profoundly "unnatural" but also hostile; moreo- ver, her hostility betrays a powerful erotic fascination she exerts on the male observer. AUTUMN 1989 9</page><page sequence="4">James E. Adams that this conjunction within Tennyson's poetry helps to explain the promi- nence and persistence of the demonic woman as a motif of Victorian culture generally. "Nature never did betray the heart that loved her," Wordsworth declared - a profession of faith that suggests how manifold and complex could be the personal and cultural investment in a feminine Nature. The femininity that Tennyson finds betrayed, and that betrays Tennyson, is like- wise not only maternal and erotic, but cognitive as well. His poetry demon- strates how intricately and profoundly the intellectual and symbolic order of the early Victorian period depends on a typology of woman as an agent of continuity, restraint, and coherence in a world in which schemes of history, political structures, and meaning itself are constantly threatening to fall apart. In this regard the plaintive, self-baffling plea in The Princess (1847) for a via media in "the woman question" unexpectedly converges with Mill's rad- ical stance in The Subjection of Women (1869). Both works rely on a tacit identification of woman with a particular mode of knowing and acting shaped by female domesticity, a "woman's wisdom" that uniquely guides and sup- ports the impetus of male action and speculation. I Darwin's response to critics of his figurative language - "It is difficult to avoid personifying the word Nature" - appeals to the inherently figura- tive character of language itself. But the rejoinder, as many commentators have objected, hardly explains Darwin's reluctance to surrender his intricate and emphatic personifications of Nature: 8 As man can produce and certainly has produced a great result by his methodical and unconscious means of selection, what may not nature effect? Man can act only on external and visible characters: nature cares nothing for appearances, except in so far as they may be useful to any being. She can act on every internal organ, on every shade of constitutional difference, on the whole machinery of life. Man selects only for his own good; Nature only for that of the being which she tends. Every selected character is fully exercised by her; and the being is placed under well-suited conditions of life. (Orgin, p. 132). Darwin's crucial analogy between natural and artificial selection is thus pre- sented in a form that defies the explanatory norms enforced by a rigorous pos- itivism. As recent Darwin scholars have pointed out, however, his metaphors generally perform what Edward Manier has called "a full job of scientific 8 As Robert Young remarks, "Even by the loose standards of biological explanation, it is surprising to find such rank anthropomorphism at the heart of the most celebrated unifying theory in biology" (Darwin's Metaphor: Nature's Place in Victorian Culture [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985], p. 93). VICTORIAN STUDIES 10</page><page sequence="5">WOMAN RED IN TOOTH AND CLAW work." This particular personification, Manier argues, has a crucial function as a heuristic device that enabled Darwin to outline his theoretical framework in some detail, even though he could not precisely specify the mechanisms that would account for natural selection. Ironically, this "logic of possibility" - like Darwin's image of nature as a conscious agent - is deeply indebted to the discourse of natural theology. Indeed, in Darwin's earlier drafts of his theory nature seems to verge on divinity: in the Sketch of 1842, it is "a being infinitely more sagacious than man," in the Essay of 1844 "a Being with penetration suf- ficient to perceive differences quite imperceptible to man."9 But why, then, should Darwin in the Origin present nature's sagacity as an emphatically femi- nine wisdom? It is not entirely surprising that Darwin's central analogy between nat- ural and human selection would articulate an ideology of gender, since the analogy is so readily associated with the dualism of nature and culture, which in turn is almost universally aligned with a cultural opposition between male and female attributes. 10 Yet the particular attributes Darwin assigns to Na- ture are revealing. The leading characteristic of this female agent is not the sheer fecundity one might associate with Mother Nature, but rather a pecu- liarly domestic femininity, an attribute closely identified with rearing off- spring and ministering to the needs of individuals. The activity of man's selection is, by comparison, rather crude, shortsighted (governed solely by external characteristics), and selfish: man selects only with an eye to what benefits man. But Nature is more discerning and more generous. She has an intuitive grasp of, and can minister to, subtleties of inner being that elude the coarser sensibility. She is careful, vigilant, disinterested, even selfless in her responsibility for "the being which she tends." " Clearly this personification responds to and underscores Darwin's apprehension of nature as a marvel of 9 Edward Manier, The Young Darwin and His Cultural Circle (Dordrecht: Reidel, 1978), pp. 150-186. The literature on Darwin's relation to the discourse of natural theology is vast and growing; for a recent development of Manier's views, see John Healy Brooke, "The Relation Between Darwin's Science and His Religion," in John Durant, ed., Darwinism and Divinity: Essays on Evolution and Religious Belief (Oxford: Blackwell, 1985), pp. 40-75. 10 For an anthropological account, see Sherry B. Ortner, "Is Female to Male as Nature Is to Culture?" in Michelle Z. Rosaldo, ed., Woman, Culture, and Society (Palo Alto: Stanford University Press, 1974), pp. 67-87. l In Darwin's Plots (London: Ark, 1984), Gillian Beer also notes the alignment of man/nature with male/female (pp. 68-74). The typology is more explicitly outlined in The Descent of Man: "Woman seems to differ from man in mental disposition, chiefly in her greater tenderness and less selfish- ness .... Woman, owing to her maternal instincts, displays these qualities towards her infants in an eminent degree; therefore it is likely that she would often extend them towards her fellow-creatures. Man is the rival of other men; he delights in competition, and this leads to ambition which passes too easily into selfishness. ... It is generally admitted that with women the powers of intuition, of rapid perception, and perhaps of imitation, are more strongly marked than in man" (2 vols., [Lon- don: John Murray, 1871], II, 326). This is a rather different and far more precise image of woman than that which Nina Auerbach discovers when she claims that Darwin incorporates in his personi- fications "his century's 'myth' " of women as "mysteriously, boundlessly metamorphic creatures" (Woman and the Demon [New York: Columbia, 1982], p. 52). AUTUMN 1989 11</page><page sequence="6">James E. Adams intricate adjustment to changing conditions. The special aptitude with which species seem to have adapted (or been adapted) to those conditions suggests an agency whose attentiveness to the individual needs of each being is dis- tinctively feminine. Moreover, the personification offers a speculative balm which anticipates the anxieties of Darwin's audience, and perhaps responds to those of Darwin himself. As forbiddingly impersonal and inhuman as evo- lution might seem, the fact that natural selection might be plausibly pre- sented as a constructive, nurturing power implied that the process need not be profoundly alien to human aspirations and desires (Manier, p. 186, notes this hint of consolation). To note these associations is not to argue, as does Stanley Edgar Hyman, that Darwin's personification is the centerpiece of a fully developed teleology, which replaces God the Father with Mother Nature. On the other hand, it is facile to object in response, with Walter Cannon, that Darwin's figure merely draws on the vocabulary of "old-fashioned" British naturalism, which "had been speaking of 'Nature' without believing in her for a hundred years or so." 12 What is at issue is not a simple dichotomy of belief and unbe- lief: it is the way in which Darwin's thought depends upon and embodies a symbolic economy of gender, the dynamics of which are brought into focus by a skepticism that challenges the traditional association of nature and mater- nity - in part simply by bringing it to consciousness. Darwin was reluctant to surrender his personification of Nature, at least in part because a feminine Nature seemed especially suited to convey his sense of the richness and intri- cacy of natural selection, as well as to impart a consolingly benign view of the moral implications of his theory. That gesture of consolation, however, is most clearly apparent in its incapacity to disarm another, more plausible inference to be drawn from Dar- win's theory. In personifying Nature as a nurturing mother, Darwin indulges in a reassuring ambiguity of the term "being." As that term is employed in the Origin, it most often denotes, not a particular individual, but a particular vari- ety or species. In retaining the traditional model of Mother Nature, Darwin resists a central feature of his theory, a feature that aligns it with much nine- teenth-century radical speculation: the subordination of individual needs to the dynamics of a group. Within the dynamics of these larger types of being, the "good" can no longer be adjusted to the demands of a particular individ- ual: it is whatever enables a particular species to become established and to survive - invariably at the expense of some of its own members - within an intricate, dynamic biological equilibrium. We must "keep steadily in mind," Darwin urges, "that each organic being is striving to increase at a geometrical 12 Stanley Edgar Hyman, The Tangled Bank (New York: Atheneum, 1962), pp. 37-40; Walter F.

When we reflect on this struggle, we may console ourselves with the full belief, that the war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply" (p. 129). It taxes scientific logic to con- ceive of an amoebum or a lichen as "happy," save in the weak sense of "fortu- nate." But there is more than a hint of straining for consolation here, and in the context Darwin can hardly personify nature as a nurturing mother. At best one might imagine a being rather like Florence Nightingale, a nurse who eases the pain of the dying. Yet the vision of incessant struggle also invites a more somber image of nature: not a nurse, but an angel of death, a monstrous agent that rigidly and impersonally lays waste its own dependents. Ten years before the publication of the Origin of Species, Tennyson in In Memoriam had imagined just such a sinister Nature. Like Darwin, Tenny- son personifies Nature as a female being whose characteristics clearly owe much to the domestic norms of Victorian femininity. Tennyson's Nature, however, acknowledges those norms by defying them. Whereas Darwin con- ceives of nature as a marvel of intricate adaptation - adaptation that suggests the activity of a feminine agent attentive to individual needs - Tennyson is most deeply engaged by the idea of a nature indifferent to its own creatures, a nature which fails to display the maternal character that even Darwin is anxious to preserve. Responding to the claims of early Victorian science within the tra- ditional conception of Mother Nature, Tennyson transforms the discrepancy between the two views of nature into a startlingly vivid and sustained portrait of feminine betrayal. Over the course of the famous sections 55 and 56, a re- mote, enigmatic "nature" turs into a predatory being, "Nature, red in tooth and claw / With ravine."

VICTORIAN STUDIES 14</page><page sequence="9">WOMAN RED IN TOOTH AND CLAW traordinary intensity and vehemence of Tennyson's personification. Yet the distinction between a god and a goddess should not be so glibly elided. When the phrase is read out of context (as it usually is), "Nature, red in tooth and claw" may not even suggest an anthropomorphic being; it might suggest a field of bloody combat or a single beast of prey. But if one attends to the de- tails of the personification, the beast of prey gives way to a more startling and more complex image. Nature is a woman red in tooth and claw - not a mere female animal (a lioness, say, could hardly cry out to the anxious poet with such articulate violence), but a woman in demonic form, a Fury. By inverting one archetype of woman, Tennyson arrives at another. Yet the deeply traditional image has in this particular cultural and poetic con- text an unusual power to shock. As befits the poet's anxieties, "Nature" as he envisions her is more "unnatural" than any beast of prey - and she is so pre- cisely by virtue of being female. This Nature confounds the traditional figure of Mother Nature, with its embodiment of a sympathetic moral order in the natural world. Moreover, that figure rests in turn on an identification of woman with maternal care that is particularly insistent in Victorian dis- course, but which Tennyson's Nature likewise resists. The nature of"Nature" - its character as both a moral and a physical order - is thus intricately bound up with the nature of woman and the conventions of gender that de- fine the feminine. The significance of the bond between Nature and the feminine is sub- tly but powerfully articulated in the simple phrase, "I care for nothing." As a disembodied utterance, the phrase immediately suggests the meaning, "I value nothing." But the words are the defiant cry of a female Nature renounc- ing her traditional maternal function, denying man's "appeal" for solace and comfort. In this context, "care for" is charged with the further associations of Darwin's verb, "to tend" ("the being which she tends"). To care for is to take care of, to nurture, particularly as one would care for a child or a delicate plant. As in the phrase "Nature, red in tooth and claw," the meaning and emotional force of Tennyson's language is again crucially dependent upon gender. In this instance, the poet regards the newly alien character of Nature as a repudiation of the most intimate, most elemental human needs. With her cry "I care for nothing," the traditionally maternal Nature rejects the poet who has just imagined himself (in section 54) as "An infant crying in the night." Tennyson's meditation upon early Victorian science thus draws much of its intensity from the erotic significance latent in the conception of nature as a feminine being. The conceptual impact of that science is felt in the most intimate aspects of (male) social and psychological being, in that the figure of Nature identifies a new conception of the natural world with the enigma of a AUTUMN 1989 15</page><page sequence="10">James E. Adams femininity that withdraws from, or openly defies, male desire. That desire and its frustration are in turn played out in two distinct but related spheres: as the collective male desire that enforces dominant conventions of femininity, and as an individual male's demand for a more personal responsiveness on the part of a particular woman. Within this sexual dynamic, the poem's central but diffuse meditations on teleology assume unexpected focus as responses to an enigma of feminine will. What is it that prompts Nature to betray her con- ventional role (and the infant crying in the night) with a violence at once symbolic and physical? Were Nature figured simply as a beast of prey, the question would be pointless, since the term would conjure up mere instinc- tive ferocity. But woman red in tooth and claw startles the reader into pon- dering intentionality. What is "the secret meaning in her deeds"? Behind the veil, behind the veil: the poet's quest for solace is thwarted by that seductive yet disturbing emblem of feminine mystery. She mysteriously withdraws the care the poet has come to expect, leaving him baffled, abandoned, and fearful: clearly this Nature incarnates that strangely tenacious and central theme of nineteenth-century literature and art, the demonic woman. In Tennyson's personification, as in Carlyle's evocation of a Sphinx-like Nature, the male observer is held in thrall when a feminine nature, formerly beautiful and benign, discloses an unexpected and terrifying enigma of violent purpose. Of course the conjunction of nature with feminine mystery is as old as Western culture itself (as Carlyle's figure re- minds us). Yet the archetype seems to take on new urgency in early Victorian discourse, when newly problematic conceptions of nature coincide with pre- vailing norms of gender that cannot easily accommodate associations of woman with mystery. The growing debate over "woman's place" consolidated a peculiarly strenuous and narrow ideal of femininity, which dictated not only that woman ought to be devoted to and dependent upon man, but also that such devotion was wholly rooted in emotion and instinct. Within the crude di- chotomy of head and heart, to which the dualism of male and female was of- ten reduced, there is no place for woman to formulate and pursue intellectual designs independent of male desires, or inaccessible to male understanding. 15 If there is mystery in such a model of femininity, it is the enigma of an intellec- tual void rather than of a hidden design. But when glimmers of independent purpose complicate the categories, they also open up a new and disturbing enigma: what could lead a woman away from her "natural" maternal and do- mestic function? (As the question would be phrased in explicitly political de- bate, "What does woman want?") This is precisely the unsettling question 15 Hence the deep mistrust of newly assertive women in the 1840s, who would soon become branded by a new epithet, "strong-minded," that came to stereotype the "unnatural" woman (Helsinger et. al., III, 82-93). VICTORIAN STUDIES 16</page><page sequence="11">WOMAN RED IN TOOTH AND CLAW Tennyson poses when he brings evolutionary conceptions of nature into jux- taposition with the traditional conception of nature as a maternal agency. He aligns the two discourses by personifying evolutionary nature as a female who subverts all the "natural" attributes of femininity and thereby confounds male desire both individual and collective. In this light, if one reflects anew on the significance of "I care for nothing," the phrase suggests not only an imper- sonal nihilism or a repudiation of maternal roles, but a specifically personal, erotic rejection: I care for nothing, and I don't care for you. The infant crying in the night merges with the spumed lover, and Nature more clearly than ever seems to assume the role of the femme fatale. It is clear, I think, how such associations could be mapped within the larger designs of In Memoriam, where the recovery of Hallam brings with it, among other things, a recuperation of the feminized, nurturing, almost do- mestic cosmos displaced by evolutionary Nature. (Hallam, as Terry Eagleton has pointed out, figures in virtually every familial relation to the poet - save, tellingly, that of the father.) 16 But Tennyson's association of contem- porary science and feminine betrayal is even more palpable and central in the other long poem he wrote during the composition of In Memoriam: The Prin- cess. 17 In In Memoriam, I have suggested, Tennyson engaged the claims of Victorian science by imagining its world as the work of a feminine Nature that had betrayed its conventional nurturing role. In The Princess the same identification is established from the opposite direction: Tennyson imagines a woman's resistance to male desire in forms that align feminine betrayal with the mechanisms of evolution. 18 II Why, for Tennyson, should affairs of the heart be so intimately bound up with the results of early Victorian science? With respect to In Memoriam 16 Terry Eagleton, "Tennyson: Politics and Sexuality in The Princess and In Memoriam," in 1848: The Sociology of Literature, ed. Francis Barker (Essex: University of Essex Press, 1978), p. 105. Eagleton's loosely Lacanian account of gender in the poem might be usefully complemented by Gliserman's attention to the contrast in the poem (and in early Victorian science writing) between a nurturing, feminized environment and a more hostile, "masculine" cosmos ("Early Victorian Sci- ence Writers and Tennyson's In Memoriam"). 17 Although a precise dating of the two poems is not essential to my argument, the material supplied by Susan Shatto and Marion Shaw in their recent edition of In Memoriam (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982) suggests that composition of The Princess and thematically related passages of In Memoriam occupied Tennyson almost simultaneously. Hallam Tennyson declared that the passages of In Memoriam dealing with evolution were written "some years before" the publication of Cham- bers's Vestiges of Creation in 1844, but Shatto and Shaw, on the basis of handwriting and placement in the manuscript, conclude that section 56 was a late addition to the Lincoln manuscript begun in November of 1842 (p. 218). This surmise (along with my suggestion that the section echoes Car- lyle's Past and Present, published in 1843) would suggest a composition date very close to, perhaps even within the period of, Tennyson's most sustained work on The Princess, from 1845 to 1847. '8 I offer an admittedly schematic reading of The Princess in pursuit of a typology of the feminine that cuts across not only traditional genre distinctions, but also conventional boundaries between po- AUTUMN 1989 17</page><page sequence="12">James E. Adams there is a familiar and obvious answer: the poet wishes to believe that he will be reunited with Hallam in an afterlife, but that faith is challenged by the fearful materialism incarnated as "Nature, red in tooth and claw." But sci- ence more immediately engages the poet's imagination and energizes his de- spair as narrative rather than as theological argument. Geology in particular articulates a history whose broad outlines mirror the history of the poet's own life. To be sure, the two narratives seem radically incommensurate in time scale and scope: the geological operates over eons and continents, the per- sonal in fragments of days and weeks - years at most - within intensely lo- calized and personalized settings. But for Tennyson the two histories are hauntingly conjoined in "the evidence of the rocks," those layers of fossilized sediment that were so powerful an emblem in the period. In "scarped cliff and quarried stone" Tennyson found an image of a long history startlingly fore- shortened, compressed into abrupt juxtapositions of presence and absence. In effect, Tennyson saw in the fossil layers irruptions of catastrophe within a uniformitarian scheme of history. 19 Hallam's death had caused just such a disruption in the steady, con- tinuous pattern of the poet's own existence. In this context, the rock strata body forth something like an anatomy of memory itself-- more precisely, of the telescoping effects of memory as it responds to loss. With Hallam's death, the life he had shared with the poet, which now seems to survive only in the poet's memory, is likewise foreshortened, abruptly sealed off, summed up, yet summoned forth with all the preternatural vividness and haunting sense of fi- nality that inheres in the record of a being irrevocably lost. Like the forces inscribed in scarped cliff and quarried stone, Hallam's death ruptures the conti- nuity of a larger history. And with that rupture the sense of identity constituted and sustained by a sense of coherent personal history, of fundamental continu- etry, science, and social criticism. In concentrating on the ideology of gender, however, I will be slighting much valuable recent commentary that links gender to the peculiar complications of genre within the poem. See especially Gerhard Joseph, Tennysonian Love: The Strange Diagonal (Minne- apolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1969), pp. 75-101; James R. Kincaid, Tennyson's Major Po- ems: The Comic and Ironic Pattern (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1975), pp. 72-77; W. David Shaw, Tennyson's Style (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1976), pp. 114-131; Eileen Tess Johnston, "This Were a Medley: Tennyson's The Princess," ELH 51 (1984), 549-574; Daniel Albright, Tennyson: The Muses' Tug-of-War (Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 1986), pp. 214-248; Herbert Tucker, Tennyson and the Doom of Romanticism (Cambridge: Harvard Univer- sity Press, 1988), pp. 350-375. The critics most attentive to ideology are Eagleton, Tucker, and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire (New York: Columbia University Press, 1985), pp. 118-133. None of these critics, however, has much to say about the prominence of evolutionary science in the poem - a topic still left largely to John Killham's valuable scholarship in Tennyson's 'The Princess': Portrait of an Age (London: Athlone Press, 1959). 19 A. Dwight Culler applies "uniformitarianism" and "catastrophism" to Tennyson's poetry in a broader sense, as analogues of literary form (The Poetry of Tennyson [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1977], pp. 15-16, 151). Thus he sees In Memoriam as the culmination of Tennyson's move- ment from catastrophic (or apocalyptic) to gradualist modes, a movement underscored by Tenny- son's avoidance of pastoral elegy. VICTORIAN STUDIES 18</page><page sequence="13">WOMAN RED IN TOOTH AND CLAW ity in one's experience, is likewise shattered into discontinuous moments of being. 20 But thou art turned to something strange, And I have lost the links that bound Thy changes; here upon the ground, No more partaker of thy change. (40.5-8). The consoling narrative of progress, in which every loss discloses a redeeming gain, collapses when one loses the links that bind the changes. The impact on the poet is delicately registered by one of the most insistent and poignant of Tennysonian rhymes. "Change" is especially "strange" when it is experi- enced as an abrupt and irreparable breach of historical continuity - whether as devastating loss in one's own life, or as the disappearance of a species rec- orded in the fossil record. Just such a ruptured narrative is writ large in rock-pits and quarries. Nature blazons the very hillsides with emblems of irreversible loss -not merely of particular individuals, but of whole "types" of being. In this light, one must appreciate that Princess Ida is a feminist of a peculiarly Victorian sort: she conceives of her goals and of social progress generally in evolutionary terms. Her vocation is not so much that of an edu- cator as of a sort of evolutionary demiurge: she will "raise" woman to a higher level of development, "mould" woman as a biological type. This evolutionary faith is succinctly evoked when, in conversation with the disguised Prince, Ida gestures toward a rock formation in which a fossil is conveniently ex- posed: "As these rude bones to us, are we to her I That will be."21 Similarly hopeful alignments of social and evolutionary development will of course be- come increasingly common during the century. But this scheme of progress deeply unsettles the Prince: "Dare we dream of that," [he] asked, "Which wrought us, as the workman and his work, Which practice betters?" (4.280-282). Ostensibly, the Prince objects to Ida's blasphemy: dare one substitute for the conception of an omniscient and omnipotent Creator the image of a far-seeing 20 In a very different approach to Tennyson, Albright describes In Memoriam as "a series of jagged, discontinuous, unconnectable moments of pain and revelation" (p. 217) - an apt (if unintended) description, I think, of what Tennyson saw in the evidence of the rocks. Both time scales - of the individual life and of geologic time - shadow the poet's evocation of human history in section 77, "the songs, and deeds, and lives, that lie / Foreshortened in the tracts of time," where "tracts" deftly summons up both physical expanses and literary works. All of these passages testify to Tenny- son's obsession with "eternal process," in which, as Tucker points out, it is remarkable "how little difference it makes what the time scale may happen to be" (p. 21). 21 4.279-280. In "The Two Sides of Early Victorian Science and the Unity of The Princess," Victorian Studies 23 (1980), 369-388, G. Glen Wickens rightly emphasizes the symbolic and structural im- portance of this episode (and its scientific allusions) but contrasts the poem as a whole with In Memoriam as "a more detached examination ... of the developmental sciences in Victorian cul- ture." Hence Wickens views evolution as a theme "played contrapuntally against the main sub- ject," the place of women, whereas I am arguing (to use Wickens's musical terms) that the themes are harmonic. AUTUMN 1989 19</page><page sequence="14">James E. Adams but limited workman whose products improve with practice? 22 But the theo- logical objection envelops a more inchoate fear, as is hinted by the ease with which the Prince's convoluted syntax can be truncated: "Dare we dream of that?" The "dream" which captivates Ida terrifies the Prince because he sees in the exposed bones an image of himself - more precisely, of the sense of self that from his very infancy has been largely founded upon his "dream" of eventual marriage to Ida. 23 The context calls attention to one facet of the appeal of that recurrent motif of Tennysonian narratives, a marriage envisioned or contracted in childhood. In The Princess as in Maud, the device urges us to see a woman's repudiation of a man's desire not merely as a momentary re- buke, but as a blow at the very foundations of male selfhood. The notorious "weird seizures" added to the poem with the third edition enforce a similar design. They underscore the extent to which the Prince's identity rests on his dream of Ida, and thus the precariousness of that identity, which threatens to dissolve when Ida fails to accommodate the dream. Hence it is that when the Prince is gravely wounded in battle, Cyril's furious denunciation holds re- sponsible, not the hostile army, but Ida's indifference: remain Orbed in your isolation; he is dead, Or all as dead .... (6.152-154). Ida's mere remoteness, like that of Nature in In Memoriam, has been trans- formed into a murderous agency. With this emphasis on the precariousness of male selfhood, the enigmas of evolution merge with the bafflements of romantic desire. When the Prince asks, "Dare we dream of that?" he poses a theological question that much exercised Tennyson: might mankind turn out to be, like the woolly mammoth, merely a false start, or a species to be superseded in some as yet ungraspable "progress" 24 But the question has a more personal bearing: 22 The analogy invokes a teleology much like that at which Darwin glances near the close of The Ori- gin of Species, where he urges his readers to "regard every complex structure and instinct as the sum- ming up of many contrivances, each useful to the possessor, nearly in the same way as when we look at any great mechanical invention as the summing up of the labour, the experience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous workmen" (p. 456). Although the trope underscores Darwin's in- debtedness to Paley, here (characteristically) teleology is subordinated to an aesthetic apprehension of nature much like that of Ruskin responding to a Gothic cathedral. 23 This continuity offers a rationale for the curious fact, stressed by Sedgwick, that the Prince never seriously considers the Princess's resistance to the enforced marriage (p. 124): it seems that a future without the Princess, a future disjoined from the past, is quite literally unimaginable. As many commentators have noted, Ida's repudiation of the past entails a rejection of Tennysonian elegy, which "moans about the retrospect" to the neglect of "that other distance," the future (4.67-68). 24 In "The Natural Theology of Tennyson's In Memoriam," rpt. in John Dixon Hunt, ed., In Memoriam: A Casebook (London: Macmillan, 1970), Graham Hough aptly cites Tennyson's remark to John Tyndall: "I should consider that a liberty had been taken with me if I were simply made a means of ushering in something higher than myself" (p. 141). VICTORIAN STUDIES 20</page><page sequence="15">WOMAN RED IN TOOTH AND CLAW might my own self-conception be nothing more than a fossilized illusion, a dead self? Princess Ida entertains both facets of the question with perfect equanimity. As she describes her dream of woman's future, she dismisses her childhood thoughts of the Prince: We touch on our dead self, nor shun to do it, Being other- since we learnt our meaning here ... (4.205-206). But the Prince cannot so readily disown his past life, since it is the basis of all the "meaning" he possesses. His predicament recalls that of the poet at the outset of In Memoriam: I held it truth, with him who sings To one clear harp in divers tones, That men may rise on stepping-stones Of their dead selves to higher things. But who shall so forecast the years And find in loss a gain to match? Or reach a hand through time to catch The far-off interest of tears? (1.1-8). Ida, like Goethe, is confident that one can discover a genuine progress in a succession of dead selves. But the Prince, like the poet, fears that the dead selves are the records not of self-transcendence, but of mere self-annihilation. One's own history might hold no more coherence than those layers of rock that record the destructive power of "Nature, red in tooth and claw." And thus Ida, in her remote, passionate devotion to an ideal of perpetual process, seems to the Prince to embody a power as inhuman and destructive as Nature seems to the poet of In Memoriam: "So careful of the type she seems / So care- less of the single life." Nature is virtually and uncannily reconstituted in the figure of the Princess, the woman who rebukes the Prince's desire in her con- cer for woman as a "type" - "her that will be." Like Nature, Ida owes her unsettlingly powerful presence in Tenny- son's poetry to her refusal to conform to the feminine function of "caring." Moreover, The Princess suggests that Ida, too, ultimately repudiates not merely "the single life" but "the type" itself: the poem's interpretation of her project has a logic precisely congruent with that of sections 55 and 56 of In Memoriam. While Ida justifies her social goals in evolutionary terms, the male world answers with a biological imperative of its own. In refusing to marry the Prince - or any other man - the Princess emphatically declares that she will have no children. Her refusal of the Prince is thus presented, not merely as a personal rebuke, but as a threat to the very survival of the species. "No doubt we seem a sort of monster to you," Ida remarks to the Prince AUTUMN 1989 21</page><page sequence="16">James E. Adams (3.259), thereby inviting precisely the objection of the male world (and of the poem): she is monstrous, profoundly unnatural, in her resistance to the biological continuity sustained by reproduction. Like Nature in In Memoriam, she seems to cry, "I care for nothing, all shall go." Not only does the poem obliquely hold Ida accountable for the Prince's brush with death, but the male voices of the poem unite to exclaim that her ideal of progress would lead to universal desolation. It is hardly surprising, then, that the Princess's "iron will" finally begins to melt when she is startled by her own outrush of mater- nal affection for an abandoned child. And her capitulation is confirmed when the wounded Prince, reduced to the condition of a helpless infant, is brought before her, and she begins to nurse him back to health. The nurtur- ing and erotic instincts that, we are to believe, she has so long, and so "un- naturally," suppressed, are thus finally released. Ida thereby comes ultimately to "care for" the Prince in all the manifold senses of that phrase as it appears in In Memoriam: she is at once nurse, mother, and lover. 25 How appropriate, then, that Tennyson should have called the name- less child "the true heroine of the poem." The child is without character, in- ert, and helpless, but it is the focal point of the feminine "care" which is the binding force in Tennysonian narratives, both personal and evolutionary. As such, moreover, the child is also the most palpable emblem of the biological and social continuity celebrated in the wake of Ida's capitulation. That conti- nuity is summed up in its many facets near the close of the poem, in a passage adapted from a draft of the "Epilogue" to In Memoriam: Look up, and let thy nature strike on mine, Like yonder morning on the blind half-world. Approach and fear not; breathe upon my brows; In that fine air I tremble, all the past Melts mist-like into this bright hour, and this Is mor to more, as the golden Autumn woodland reels Athwart the smoke of burning weeds. (7.330-337). The two poems thus seem to converge in their resolutions, as the disruptions of loss are repaired in a renewed continuum of being that is confirmed by an em- blematic marriage. As Hallam's loss is recuperated through the reconstruction of a teleological order in nature, so in The Princess a frighteningly impersonal scheme of social evolution is humanized by the domestication of Princess Ida. Domestication, indeed - for the new social order heralded by the Prince seems to leave little place for Ida's earlier vision of woman's future. 25 The emphasis the poem places on Ida's role as a surrogate mother to the Prince can be gauged by the unanimity on this point of readings which otherwise differ radically in method and conclusions. See, for example, Joseph, p. 98; Johnson, p. 131; Eagleton, p. 101; Sedwick, p. 123. The Prince, as Sedgwick notes, thus retains "the privileged status of a baby . . . along with the implicit empowerment of maleness." VICTORIAN STUDIES 22</page><page sequence="17">WOMAN RED IN TOOTH AND CLAW The "statelier Eden" the Prince envisions is the paradise of the Victorian drawing room, a paradise to be won and sustained not by social reform but by procreation. With his tableau of man and wife sitting side by side, "full- summed in all their powers, / Dispensing harvest, sowing the to-be" (7.272-273), the Prince assigns to Ida what the poem endorses as her true vo- cation: motherhood, whose "harvest" will be children. Of course the two vocations need not be incompatible, but the poem insinuates a radical dis- junction between them when Cyril locates the "one pulse that beats true woman" (6.164) in Ida's maternal susceptibility to the claims of a helpless in- fant (whether it be Psyche's child or the Prince himself). Such appeals neatly reverse Ida's goal: whereas she has urged her sisters to "lose the child / And gain the woman," the poem implies that one gains the woman by finding the child. 26 The implication makes itself felt in the hint of self-immolation when Ida accepts the male world's designation: her caring, she admits, is "that / Which kills me with myself" (6.286-287). Such reversals articulate a dou- bled logic, which undercuts the ostensibly progressive sympathies of the poem. Tennyson clearly wishes to present marriage and social reform as com- plementary states, even extensions of one another. Hence, most obviously, he attempts to disarm and dissociate himself from familiar conservative views of "woman's place" by embodying them in the Prince's reactionary father, who is all patriarchal outrage and bluster: "Man for the field and woman for the hearth, / Man for the sword and for the needle she" (5.437-438). Ulti- mately, however, it is the voice of the Prince's father which triumphs. "The bearing and the rearing of a child / Is woman's wisdom," he proclaims (5.455-456) - which is precisely the conclusion of the poem. 27 III It is hardly surprising that Tennyson's poetry should embody a conser- vative attitude toward the advancement of women. But my point is to stress the importance of "woman" in that conservatism - to argue that the ostensi- bly progressive ideology of The Princess is dislocated by the immense impor- 26 Accounts of the child form a revealing index of critical preoccupations, since the child is so richly overdetermined as a symbol. For importantly different views, see Johnston and Albright. 27 Few recent commentators agree with W. Stacy Johnson, who finds The Princess "a remarkably lib- eral poem about woman's role in society" (p. 110). But it is curious that many of the most strenuous critics of the poem's ideology look to explain the poem's conclusion by a logic internal to Ida's proj- ect. Sedgwick, for example, finds a "conceptual flaw" in Ida's authoritarian vision of social change - change "from the top down" - which she identifies with the complacent view of Sir Walter and the frame narrative. But surely the more apt comparison would be to Carlyle's Abbot Samson - a model of heroism for which, one assumes, Tennyson had a fair amount of respect, and which could be dramatized without such glaring contradictions. Ida's stature as a Carlylean hero suggests that her fate is ultimately responsive specifically to an ideology of gender. AUTUMN 1989 23</page><page sequence="18">James E. Adams tance assigned to "woman's wisdom" as a force which holds together not only social frameworks but the very fabric of intellectual and historical coherence. In particular, an ideal of feminine caring figures in Tennyson's poetry as a binding force of continuity and conservation in an age which welcomes change as progress but deeply fears that the continuity of progress might be punctuated by revolution, whether as social and political transformation, as displacement of moral and intellectual frameworks, or even, in nature itself, as extinction. The crucial role of the feminine as an index of continuity is confirmed in one further passage of In Memoriam, from Section 114, which has an im- portant bearing both on The Princess and on my topic as a whole: Who loves not Knowledge? Who shall rail Against her beauty? May she mix With men and prosper! Who shall fix Her pillars? Let her work prevail. But on her forehead sits a fire: She sets her forward countenance And leaps into the future chance, Submitting all things to desire. Half-grown as yet, a child, and vain She cannot fight the fear of death. What is she, cut from love and faith But some wild Pallas from the brain Of Demons? Fiery-hot to burst All barriers in her onward race For power. Let her know her place; She is the second, not the first. A higher hand must make her mild, If all be not in vain; and guide Her footsteps, moving side by side With wisdom, like the younger child. (114.1-20). Similar injunctions can be found again and again in Victorian schemes of his- tory: let us have progress - social, political, intellectual - but let us be cer- tain that it is progress and not revolution. (Tellingly, the first stanza of this section is taken over verbatim from an 1832 Tennyson hymn to British political continuity, "Hail Briton.") As often noted, moreover, Tennyson frequently makes this appeal by way of a traditional distinction between knowledge and wisdom. As in discussions of "Nature," however, critics have failed to attend to the emphatically feminine embodiment of Tennyson's abstractions, which in this instance have an extraordinarily provocative resonance alongside The Princess. 28 The poet's attitude toward Knowledge is precisely that of the 28 Gerhard Joseph's "Tennyson's Concepts of Knowledge, Wisdom, and Pallas Athene," Modem Phi- lology 69 (1972), 314-322, is the most extended treatment of the theme; Joseph discusses section 114 at some length, but makes no reference to gender - and indeed fails to distinguish the "wild Pallas" from the "Pallas Athene" hallowed by myth. VICTORIAN STUDIES 24</page><page sequence="19">WOMAN RED IN TOOTH AND CLAW Prince toward Princess Ida. "Let her work prevail": thus much the Prince ini- tially seems to urge, but he recoils from her work when it assumes a militant form that seems to rupture "the ties of love and faith." Ultimately he unites with the rest of the male world in concluding that Ida, too, must "know her place." As an incarnation of Knowledge, Ida lears that a higher hand must make her mild - the hand, it is implied, that belongs to a husband. In the personification of Knowledge, then, as in his personification of Nature and his depiction of Princess Ida, Tennyson incarnates the violence lurking in a threat to social and historical continuity as a female agent who subverts the maternal norms of Victorian femininity. Mother Nature yields to Nature red in tooth and claw; Pallas Athene to a "wild Pallas, from the brain of de- mons." The contrast between Knowledge and Wisdom neatly embodies the dualism of demon and angel. 29 Tennyson's feminine personifications thus can be aligned with a phe- nomenon that Neil Hertz has discerned among Tennyson's French contem- poraries, in which male writers appropriate images of woman to embody an hysterical reaction to the threat of political revolution. 30 But I want to con- clude by pointing to an unexpectedly similar reliance on the feminine in a work that itself calls for a social and conceptual revolution: John Stuart Mill's The Subjection of Women (1869). Mill of course argues that masculine and feminine attributes cannot be viewed as ahistorical essences, since they are so profoundly shaped by social conditions. Hence his admirable impatience with arguments that appeal to "woman's place," as if that place ratified a timeless biological femininity. And yet, when Mill discusses the contributions women might make to intellectual and social advance, he falls back on an epistemol- ogy of gender remarkably like that of Darwin and Tennyson. In chapter 3 of Subjection, Mill points out that "speculative minds" are beset by the danger- ous tendency to lose "the lively perception and ever-present sense of objec- tive fact." Hence, he continues, hardly anything can be of greater value to a man of theory and speculation . .. than to carry on his speculations in the companionship, and under the criticism, of a really supe- rior woman. There is nothing comparable to it for keeping his thoughts within the limits of real things, and the actual facts of nature. A woman seldom runs wild after an abstrac- tion. The habitual direction of her mind to dealing with things as individuals rather than in groups, and (what is closely connected with it) her more lively interest in the present feelings of persons, which makes her consider first of all, in anything that claims to be 29 Ida and her academy are at several points aligned with Pallas Athene, and the Prince's account of her apology (which has the ring of an official confession) echoes the distinction between Knowl- edge and Wisdom: "She prayed me not to judge their cause from her / That wronged it, sought far less for truth than power I In knowledge: something wild within her breast, / A greater than all knowledge, beat her down" (7.220-223). Charles Kingsley's 1850 review of the poem in Fraser's offers a final illuminating gloss on Ida's transgression: "at last, she loses all feminine sensibility ... and becomes all but a vengeful fury, with all the peculiar faults of woman and none of the peculiar excellencies of man" (cited by Helsinger, et al., III, 95). 30 Neil Hertz, "Medusa's Head: Male Hysteria under Political Pressure," Representations 1 (1983), 27-54. AUTUMN 1989 25</page><page sequence="20">James E. Adams applied to practice, in what manner persons will be affected by it - these two things make her extremely unlikely to put faith in any speculation which loses sight of individu- als, and deals with things as if they existed for the benefit of some imaginary entity . . . not resolvable into the feelings of living beings. 31 Although the passage obviously pays oblique tribute to Harriet Tay- lor, Mill couches his praise in provocatively universal terms. Through the equivocality of "individuals," a term which functions here both as a logical category and as a synonym for "persons," he assigns to woman a distinctively feminine epistemology. Woman, Mill urges, deals with things "as individuals rather than in groups" - because, it would seem, her domestic role dictates that she attend to persons in the same way. Unlike man, she is responsive to (and responsible for) "the present feelings of persons." 32 As a consequence, the "really superior woman" regulates the coherence of, but does not fully participate in, what seems an exclusively masculine mode of speculation. The feminine confines the masculine "within the limits of real things" and re- strains the masculine when it threatens to go astray into "regions not peopled with real beings." "A woman," in short, "hardly ever runs wild after an ab- straction." But what better description of the transgression of Princess Ida, or of Knowledge in In Memoriam? When these feminine figures pursue their alle- giance to an abstract ideal, they deny precisely the regulative, conservative principle inherent in the belief that woman's wisdom resides in a care for "the feelings of living beings" - or, to adapt Darwin's phrase, for the beings which she should tend. Even as Mill rejects a traditional version of the feminine as a social norm, he recuperates the category as a cognitive ideal. For Mill, as for Ten- nyson and Darwin, the domestic, maternal ideal continues to codify a mode of acting and knowing that is essentially different from, and subordinate to, male agency, yet which men (and their systems) require and celebrate as a principle that is needed to complement and regulate masculine activity. The feminine ideal is motivated not only as a source of immediate erotic and so- cial gratification, but as a discursive category that underwrites the coherence and stability of the existing cultural order. The motif of the femme fatale em- bodies a disturbance of this order, an unsettling of the established typologies of masculine and feminine. The motif is thus pathological, not in the nar- rowly psychological sense urged by Mario Praz in The Romantic Agony, but in the more inclusive sense of an intellectual pathology - a disorder in the 31 John Stuart Mill, The Subjection of Women, in Three Essays (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1975), p. 496. 32 Note that in the relation Mill sets forth, feminine apprehension of things as individuals is not de- termined by social function; it is merely analogous to it, "closely connected with it." We are left to believe that a distinctively feminine cognition, like that closely related and distinctively feminine concern for "the feelings of living beings," has its origin less in society than in some biological es- sence. VICTORIAN STUDIES 26</page><page sequence="21">WOMAN RED IN TOOTH AND CLAW dominant cultural and discursive systems of the age. Hence the perhaps sur- prising connection between early Victorian science and a motif commonly associated with the narrowly "artistic" culture of the fin-de-siecle. When evolutionary speculation unsettles traditional conceptions of nature as a ma- ternal being, it also disturbs Victorian typologies of the feminine; yet the same speculation thereby prompts a new recognition of the significance of the feminine, not only as a biological category but as an organizing principle of Victorian discourse. To be sure, one must study the femme fatale as but one aspect of the extraordinarily complex topic of gender in the nineteenth cen- tury. 33 Yet numerous examples of the motif declare an unmistakable affilia- tion with images of nature derived from British empiricism. After all, what is perhaps the most famous femme fatale in British literature, Walter Pater's Gioconda, appears in an essay on a figure who is both homosexual artist and Faustian scientist - an essay, moreover, which takes as its motto a phrase drawn from Bacon: Homo minister interpres naturae - Man the servant and interpreter of nature.
