<plain_text><page sequence="1">PLACING RAHNER, INTERPRETING ROETHKE Robert E. Doud Theodore Roethke's poetry contains a consistent (if occasionally confused) doctrine on the subject of matter and spirit. It is a kind of hylomorphism in which spirit, the formal element, finds in matter its proper place - not as it retreats or withdraws from matter, but rather as it penetrates and appropriates matter. Human life is a journey made of cycles of effusion into matter and recovery from this effusion with reflection upon it. A comparable treatment of the relationship between matter and spirit appears in the theology of Karl Rahner. Rahner's work celebrates the inextricable worldliness of the human spirit, projected into the world to appropriate itself in freedom and love, and to return to the transcendent source of its creation. The same relationship of matter and spirit obtains analogously between God and the world, soul and body, grace and person, God's creative presence and all of nature. In many poems Roethke seeks to appropriate the entire evolu- tionary process that is somehow still present in his human organism. Through sympathy and sensibility Roethke identifies himself with the plants found in his father's greenhouse, and goes on to become one with the lower registers of animal existence, including the slugs, worms, snails, eels, and slime of the garden and woods. No other writer has moved us so far to identify with species we have otherwise found to be loathesome or repulsive. With these we share a common tissue of material reality and organic sensibility. Such identification is a regression through successive orders of life toward a primordial oneness shared among earthly creatures. Regression occurs in Roethke in at least three ways. First of all, if we take a close integration of matter and spirit to be normal and nor- R&amp;L 16.3 (Autumn 1984) 39</page><page sequence="2">40 Religion &amp; Literature mative, then a recoiling of spirit into itself and away from matter is one form of regression. A second would be a passive suspension, a go- ing limp on the part of spirit as it rests in matter, instead of a normal dynamic and directing activity of spirit within matter. A third regres- sion is the movement from technical, practical uses of words to the more ambiguous and primordial use of language in poetry. In all three cases, regression is a backhanded requisite for spiritual and psy- chological progress. Journey and Sensibility in Roethke The journey theme in Roethke is, ambiguously, both progress and regression. In his "First Meditation" {Poems 15 If.) he speaks of a "Journey within a journey." The bus is moving forward, but as it does, "I seem to go backward / Backward in time." He immediately speaks of two sparrows, one within a greenhouse, and the other out- side in the bright day. They sing alternately. If the greenhouse sug- gests the unconscious, the locus of all regressions, the outside and brightness suggest conscious life. The two sparrows correspond to the two journeys (Sullivan 157). Regression in the greenhouse comple- ments progress in the light of day. The "First Meditation" might also represent the two sparrows as partners in a vocal duet in which the song of one invokes the song of the other. On one level spirit is on an interior journey toward per- sonal individuation or self-enactment, while on another level, it travels in intimacy with a partner in which the song of one penetrates the other and both rise together in ecstasy. The direction on the first level is inward and regressive; the direction on the second level is out- ward and progressive, and yet each serves as a necessary condition for the other. In part three of the "First Meditation" the spirit "tries for another life." It is analogous to "a salmon, tired, moving up a shallow stream." The fish "Nudges into a back-eddy, a sandy inlet / Bumping against sticks and bottom-stones." Then he swings around again and swims forward in the "maincurrent." This is how the spirit journeys. There are detours, reversals, setbacks, and deliberate dalliances, yet penetration of coves and cul-de-sacs is part of the going. It is of the nature of spirit to journey. The spirit is a movement away from the self. It can be a downward movement: "The spirit moves, but not always upward" {Poems 153). It is a clumsy journey (Donoghue 222): "two horses plunging in snow, their lines tangles, /</page><page sequence="3">ROBERT E. DOUD 41 A great wooden sleigh careening behind them." The spirit tries for another life, "Another way and place in which to continue." In an- other poem, "The Interior," it is a journey out of the self and there are many detours {Poems 187). When the interior is reached, the spirit is no longer moving, but everything else is: "The soul [is] at a still- stand." Here there is neither forward nor backward - "Unperplexed, in a place leading nowhere." Here too there is an equipoise when the spirit achieves its distance from the self: "The spirit of wrath becomes the spirit of blessing." The patron of journeys appears in "The Far Field" as an old man of the sea, like Proteus, the god of transformations (Malkoff 186). Spirit, at a distance from self, undergoes change: "The lost self changes" {Poems 195). Here a man faced with his own immensity has a spirit that moves like a monumental wind. "He is the end of things, the final man." This protean image is also heralded in "Four for Sir John Davies." The Elizabethan who celebrates the cosmic dance in his poem, "Orchestra," sings of several gods of transformation. Proteus is the first, who dances himself "Into a stream, a lion, a tree / And many other forms fantastic strange" (Chambers 759). Then came Caeneus, "made at first a man, / And then a woman, then a man again." Caeneus dances first the man's part, then the woman's, then the man's again. This resembles the changes of Roethke in "Medita- tions of an Old Woman," particularly in "Fourth Meditation." Accord- ing to Davies, Tiresias also played the roles of both sexes in a dance, and took more pleasure in the woman's part. Venus became a fish and danced through the waves, so she is added to the retinue of shape- shifters. Stanley Kunitz sees Roethke as a Proteus who undergoes transfor- mations, not in order to avoid using a gift of prophecy, but in order to use a gift of poetry (23). There is a constant shifting of shapes in which the poet loses himself in order to find himself, gives up his human identity in order to discover the deeper truth about it (Parini 177, Donoghue 222). This plasticity gives his identity a slippery am- biguity, and yet this slipperiness also achieves an identity which is organic with the entire world. He shares with the world a common tissue of sensibility, and becomes what he already is, an organic partner of all life. The boun- daries between his bodily identity and that of other creatures is vague, shifting and ambiguous. He is a person without skin, and yet stones are sensitive and have skin. Skin is not a barrier to a sensibility shared with other things, but a two-way medium in which there is a mutu-</page><page sequence="4">42 Religion &amp; Literature ality of touching and being touched (Merleau-Ponty 131). Nothing is fully object to him; nothing is devoid of subjectivity, and what subjec- tivity there is is common to poet and object. "I touched the stones, and they had my own skin" {Poems 128). Regression in Rahner and Roethke The philosophical theology of Karl Rahner contains a consistent doctrine on the relationship of spirit and matter. Winfried Corduan has pointed out that this relationship obtains principally on three levels: epistemology, philosophical anthropology, and Christology. It also governs Rahner's treatment of such topics as sensibility, personal becoming, and death. These latter topics may correspond to the three main divisions of Roethke's work. Corduan says that Rahner's epistemology is based on Thomas Aquinas's notion of the conversio ad phantasma (285). The conversio en- tails the consistent turning of our abstract, universal, and spiritual knowledge in concepts toward the concrete, particular, and material knowledge we have of individuals. The termination of all acts of knowing is not in ideas abstracted from the world, but in the world, as an existential judgment unites concepts to phantasms, which are the material aspects of the objects we know. Through the phantasms the judgment reaches the essences of real objects in the world. The spiritual and material aspects of knowing belong to each other, and, after spirit completes its process of abstracting, it reverses its direc- tion, referring back to matter and to individuals {Spirit 237). In the epistemology and theology of Karl Rahner, God is not dis- covered originally as a being who exists in the outside world, in the cosmos, or even beyond the cosmos. Rather, God exists in the know- ing subject as the ground of our knowledge of being as such. God is the first light of our intellect, a proto- or pre-concept {Vorgriff in spirit 225f.), which, when a universal concept is abstracted, scans the entire range of universals and compares the new concept to them. We thus know the concept, not only as what it is, but as what it is not. For this to occur, the universals must have their own metaphysical reality in "common being" {ens). Common being is the sum total of the essences of all possible beings; it is "being in general." Common being is only possible as it is grounded in "pure being" {esse), and pure being is God. God as Absolute grounds all of our knowledge. The self as knower, and eventually as lover, needs an "other," if it is to realize itself; and</page><page sequence="5">ROBERT E. DOUD 43 what is co-known as it differentiates itself from the being of the other is pure being. Our knowledge of God ( Vorgrifj) is the foundation for the possibility of our knowledge of everything else. Not known direct- ly, but only as it illumines concepts, this knowledge is the horizon against which all acts of knowledge occur. If the knowledge of the world is a kind of cognitive progress, then knowledge of God is a kind of regression into the mind of the knower. Like Rahner's, Roethke's mysticism places spirit squarely within matter, and it knows God first in a primordial regression of spirit from matter, rather than in the cosmos or in the objective order and harmony of the world. If knowledge of the world is a kind of journey, then knowledge of God is a journey backwards within a journey forward. Another journey is that of Divine Spirit as it creates the world. God wills to become other and to actualize divinity in another. God thus creates matter as an otherness, as a receptacle for divine being, and puts divinity out into the other as spirit. In matter God fully realizes divinity as a self-communication in another. This also serves to make the creation a primordial pattern for the incarnation of God in a human being in Jesus Christ. The journey of God into the world is begun in the creation of matter and continued in the incarnation. Human spirit also undertakes a journey, and this journey is a con- tinuation of the evolutionary process, which is the history of the rela- tionship of spirit and matter, of God and the world. In order to realize itself, human spirit must be embodied, must emanate as form through matter, must risk the loss or dissipation of itself in sensibility, and must recover itself and establish its integrity. Matter and spirit are inextricably mixed in the human condition, and each is the necessary condition for the existence and expansion of the other. Again, when comparing Rahner and Roethke, spirit's suspension in matter can be seen as a risk of regression, a regression that is necessary for spirit's progress and development. Spirit must depart from self, in Roethke's terms, in order to merge with things other than itself (Mills 50). This corresponds, in Rahner's terms, to the sus- pension in sensibility. Sensibility refers to the mutual interpenetration of matter and spirit. Matter embodies spirit and serves as the proper place of spirit. Regression occurs when spirit, properly active and integrating, be- comes passive and limp, dissipating within the matter in which it is suspended. Spirit always involves both an active penetration of mat- ter, and a passive surrender to what matter has to offer. In this condi- tion of active receptivity spirit receives knowledge-bearing impres- sions from objects in the world, is affected by its surroundings, and</page><page sequence="6">44 Religion &amp; Literature risks being changed or lost in the process. Risk-taking ventures that lead to regressive setbacks are part of spiritual progress. Roethke's sensibility is one expressed as "a steady storm of cor- respondences" {Poems 231). These correspondences are analogies be- tween physical and spiritual realities. Things encountered in the out- side world resonate with structures within the human personality. It is the job of the poet to discover and celebrate these correspondences and resonances, "Transmuting nature into spirit through the penetrating imagination, and thereby lifting himself out of the isolated personality" (La Belle 159). Regression deals with feeling our own internal structures; but since this is triggered by experiences in the outside world, regression overcomes isolation in the long run. There is in Roethke a regressive turn of consciousness toward the unconscious as a private wellspring of meaning. Here consciousness penetrates the unconscious, but allows the unconscious to have power over it. Spirit departs from self and risks loss of return by its sojourn in the murkiness of the pre-personal roots of human existence. This is both revelatory and therapeutic. It is a risk that must be taken in order to avoid the breakup experienced by other modern poets - the fragmentation of the consciousness and the unconscious. Regression is necessary if the highly individualized self is to regain its connection with the sensual world, and thereby with itself in all of its own dimen- sions. The journey of spirit accomplishes this connection. The greenhouse, central image of his earliest poems, is an am- biguous symbol for Roethke. It is filled with rank sweats and smells, scums, smuts and mildews, especially under the boxes where the boy has to trim the roots and tendrils {Poems 37). It is also a heaven on earth, a mother, a womb, a place full of life, his symbol for the whole of life. He is both attracted to it and repulsed by it. It is here that he acquires the sympathetic and symbiotic taste for minimal existences and "lovely diminutives." Newts and lice, moths and moles, beetles and creeping things deserve his human sympathy and help his psychic growth as they evoke his response. Brown sees in the greenhouse poems a crumbling of the traditional walls surrounding the self (1244). The distinction of self and nonself no longer obtains. Feelings between subject and environment run into each other. In the poetizing process mind and things become one. There is a back-and-forth relationship between the self and its world, a moment of being lost in the opaqueness of the other, and a return to the limpidity of self-possession. In all of this, the poet risks annihilation, irretrievable loss of self, or fragmentation of the self. The return is not guaranteed.</page><page sequence="7">ROBERT E. DOUD 45 Regression, Suspension, and Return Benjamin Saltman divides the poetry of Roethke into three periods: regression, the dance, and incarnation. The overarching theme of the entire corpus is that of a spiritual journey that is a flight as much as a quest (Saltman 196, Kunitz 24). Each of the three phases is riddled with this ambiguity. Psychological regression is a necessary means to psychic growth and spiritual progress. The dance is a suspension of one's own powers of control, and a deriving of power through interconnection with another. The incarnation is a mystical penetration of darkness in order to reach light. Lynn Ross-Bryant, working independent from Saltman, develops strikingly similar divisions of Roethke's work. Rootedness in the primordial earth, shared life, and identity through mysticism are the themes she treats in sequence. Here too, the mysticism is incarna- tional or sacramental, because it is one that integrates spirit and mat- ter instead of extricating spirit from matter. She cites Nathan Scott who referred to this incarnational mysticism as "sacramentation" (Scott 117f., Ross-Bryant 45). In her analysis of "The Lost Son" Ross-Bryant indicates that the title of the poem has a double meaning: It refers to the child who is wandering in a strange, bewildering world as he begins to leave behind his original relationship with nature and his parents and attempts to discover himself. At the same time, however, the lost son is part of the adult and must in some way be recovered and transformed if the adult is to move forward on his spiritual journey. (46) Woodlawn is described as a cemetery where iron gates slam and something drips over stones (Williams 46). It is a time of psycho- logical burial: "Worm, be with me" {Poems 50). The spirit is sus- pended in the depths of matter. The poet is hunting by a river edge, among rubbish, bug-riddled foliage, and muddy bog-holes. He thinks he sees a rat that usually goes just under the water. He compares the rat to an otter, one a repulsive animal, the other fun-loving and entertaining. There are five divisions of "The Lost Son": "The Flight," "The Pit," "The Gibber," "The Return," and "It was beginning winter." The poem has two movements, represented as the flight and the return. Between the two movements is a dangerous dalliance in which spirit has journeyed far from self and is in peril of self-loss in permanent limp suspension. The middle phase is treated in "The Pit" and "The Gibber." The first of these subphases is a recognition of a maternal</page><page sequence="8">46 Religion &amp; Literature principle, Mother Mildew, and the second is a recognition of a pater- nal principle, Father Fear. "It was beginning winter" follows self- retrieval, celebrates the relief of a completed return, and anticipates further ventures. The same ground is covered in each of the two major movements of "The Lost Son." The flight phase passes through an alien and viscose medium, and the second through a familiar and humid at- mosphere. The first is the cold cemetery, the second the heated greenhouse. The dark and alien terrain covered in the first is the same as the lightsome and friendly turf of the family nursery. Recognition transforms the first into the second. The difference between being lost and being found is recognizing where you are. In the flight phase the poet is "falling through a dark swirl" {Poems 54). He feels the slime of a wet nest, and something like the skin of a cat and the back of an eel rolled in cold grease. Here mildew is his mother with its danger of decay and spoil. It is a phase of chaos and risk. The recovery phase is a phase of paternal order. He listens to something he has heard before: the tapping of his father's pipe and the knocking of the steam pipes. Recognition begins, and eventually the dark water gives way to sweeps of light. There is a movement from the lash of primordial milk to the whistle of money. It is as if he is being begotten in the parental embrace. He is at the eye and heart of the storm where "The ground is unstilling itself." At the furthest outreach of this journey, father and mother unite: "Money, money, money / Water, water, water." This is also a union of consciousness and the unconscious. The former has not over- whelmed, but penetrated and enjoyed, the latter. Through recogni- tion of this togetherness, this ultimate correspondence in the heart of the storm, he gains an eyeful of the way back. His return to self after suspension in otherness is spoken of as find- ing his way to the boiler, the source of heat in the greenhouse. It is dark and the cinders are slippery, but the roses are breathing in the dark. As the previous phase was described as a descent into a dark pit, this one finds a single light swinging by the fire-pit. Here the fireman pulls out "big bloody clinkers," spent, glowing coals that are also referred to as roses. Now even the weeds are moving in a slow up-sway. The moment of recognition and repose might be treated as a third phase. There would be the first journey, or spirit's emanation into matter, which is experienced psychologically as a regression, with risk of self-loss, suspension unending. Next is the suspension itself, a repose in the viscosity of thick matter, but also the occasion for the</page><page sequence="9">ROBERT E. DOUD 47 crucial moment of recognition. Then comes the second journey, a recovery, return and self-possession, after having been enriched by a night of adventure. A terrible nightmare, perhaps based on the death of a parent, is only, after all, a night spent by a boy in the security of his father's greenhouse. The final division of the poem reflects on the whole process ex- perienced as a "beginning winter." It had been the entertainment of "A lively understandable spirit." This experience will come again, and the lingering lesson is to be still and wait. The journey had brought him to the extreme edge of the storm, but now he is back in his original placid place, the point of departure, which is also an eye of the hurricane. He will venture out again into the winter weather. All of life is a journey, but it is composed of discrete episodes of venturing and returning, punctuated by stillness and equipoise. The question arises as to how poetry itself entails regression. A Rahnerian answer to this might come in the theologian's treatment of primordial words. Our contemporary language is largely demystified and desacralized (Rahner, "Priest" 298). Influenced by science, our words tend to have exact and technical meanings. By contrast, poetic words are primordial words, which lack exactness, but contain great meaning. The ambiguity of poetic words is not due as much to a defect of accuracy, as to a plethora of meaning. Meaning arrives in language as bursts of symbolic richness before it is pared down for technical use by analytic reason. Regression from the practical, utilitarian, or technical meaning of language is required if we are to recover its primordial significance. Some of the poetic language of Roethke resembles the first at- tempts at language on the part of a small child {Poems 113, LaBelle 59). Other uses of language may be regressions from conscious in order to draw close to primordial bursts of meaning from the un- conscious {Poems 211). Still others are attempts to give voice to the feeling of very primitive forms of life. This last concern has to do with the evoking of sensibilities relating to these same forms as they resonate within humans as a result of the evolutionary process. Primordial words are creative and evocative of meaning (Williams 201), rather than merely expressive of it. "The device of poetry be- comes a means of discovery rather than just a method of communicat- ing what is already known" (LaBelle 162). The poet or primal thinker uses language as an epistemological probe rather than as just a way of putting into signs what has been learned already. The ordinary way of using words is practical and precise, or intends to be, whereas the primordial way is ambiguous and as yet undistilled by utilitarian</page><page sequence="10">48 Religion &amp; Literature applications. The primordial way generates meaning, whereas the practical way refines meaning. The Dance, Personal Becoming, and Sexuality In "Four for Sir John Davies" Roethke treats of a dance that is not the dance of the Elizabethan who was sure of the world's ultimate har- mony and the ultimate dancing master. Roethke tries to fling his shadow at the moon, that is, tries to project in Feurbachian fashion, an anthropomorphic deity who would set the rhythm and teach him how to dance (Poems 101). He is "dancing-mad," but he has no danc- ing master. He dances all alone, and what he learns is eventually revealed in "The Waking," that we learn to dance only by dancing: "I learn by going where I have to go" (Poems 104). The dance, even if one is dancing alone, is a matter of the interplay of two forces, "the bears and Yeats": matter and spirit, the animal and the rational side of us. This involves animal and human heat, gaiety and dread, abandonment to whatever happens and the risk of em- bracing an ultimate lack of order and meaning. The bears who dance are not the projected shapes of the two ursine dippers in the constella- tions, but animal archetypes within the poet (Sullivan 101). The finding of God as a source of dancing madness within the per- sonality, rather than as an orchestration of external reality to give ob- jective knowledge of God, resonates with Rahner's finding of the divine vestigia, not in the cosmos where Aquinas found them, not as an objective datum placed in the universe like a heavenly body, but in the Vorgriff or unthematized proto-apprehension of God which is requisite for our knowledge of being. Divinity, for both thinkers, oc- curs in the foundational recesses of subjectivity, rather than in the ob- jective order of the universe (Carr 21, Robertson 391). In the first division of the poem, "The Dance," we find that we are a dance of matter and spirit, even if dancing alone. In the second divi- sion, "The Partner," sexual intercourse becomes a kind of dance. We find something of a dancing-master in our partner: "What's the cue? - / Do what the clumsy partner wants to do!" The completion of self re- quires the completion of a partner. "What is desire?- / The impulse to make someone else complete?" Our sexual urge is not basically self- ish, but is an urge to satisfy another. Our being is a being in another, in the sexual partner: "we live beyond / Our outer skin." Our spirit is not contained in the matter of our own bodies, but penetrates the skin of the other in love- making. The joy that is generated is deeper than an animal satisfac-</page><page sequence="11">ROBERT E. DOUD 49 tion: "This joy outleaps the dog." The body and the soul reach a peak of communion with one another as the partners know sexual ecstasy: aThe body and the soul know how to play / In that dark world where gods have lost their way." Body and soul increase and fuse together as the spirit of each partner penetrates the other. "The Wraith" is a syzygy of partners, a shape who leaps forward at the sensual cry of orgasm. As the ecstatic partners rise to meet the moon, they become the wraith, one body, one appearance: ua shape alone, / Impaled on light, / and whirling slowly down." On the way to orgasm "the spirit and the flesh [cry] out for more." The cry of spirit and flesh in the early part of the stanza is a cry of longing, while the cry of the partners in the latter part is a cry of satisfaction. The iden- tities of the partners become commingled as the wraith: "Did each become the other in that dance?" In sex both spirits share the matter of both bodies. Both partners are out of themselves, or, at the ex- tremity of spirit's extension into matter: "In the middle of ourselves we lay." In the act of union the invisible becomes visible: "The flesh can make the spirit visible." The wraith may also be God (Malkoff 1 19). In the first division the poet's attempt to fling his shadow at the moon fails, but in the third division the partners rise to meet the moon. Spirit and flesh together reach a greater height in communion with a partner of like constitu- tion than they can reach alone. The moon is reached and the shape descends. Perhaps it is the shadow - which cannot reach the moon alone - that does descend in intercourse with a partner. Intersubjec- tivity, mutual co-enactment, brings about relationship with God such as solitude never knows (Carr 28, Robinson 398). "The Vigil" envisages Dante, who "shook with a mighty power beyond his will." The mighty power of God and the mighty power of the flesh both overwhelm us; and in lovers the two powers are one: "All lovers live by longing, and endure." Lovers perish into one another and thus risk loss of self: "I perished in her form, / Who rise from flesh to spirit know the fall." Roethke also suggests that divinity is projected out of humanity, rather than being incarnated into us from a transcendent source: "The word outleaps the world, and light is all." In this context sensibility is a glutinous medium, a viscosity or lubricity, that allows one spirit to penetrate the other. This is achieved only as bodies interpenetrate, and the two become one spirit in one flesh. This happens by a power which is greater than either of the per- sonal spirits, and is an experience which reveals divine presence. Roethke, like Rahner, has an experience of God both in the primor-</page><page sequence="12">50 Religion &amp; Literature dial horizon for knowledge in the recesses of the mind, and in human intercommunion as spirits joined through bodily intimacy. When Rahner treats of the love of God and the love of neighbor, he indicates that it is only by passing out of the depth of our being and into the world as the principle and place of otherness that we can enter into the depth of our own persons where we stand before God. It is in the world that we live in community with other beings. Here persons freely open to one another (Tallon 125). The anthropological principles worked out in reference to cognition also apply to love and will. The journey to full self-enactment is a path through and with other persons. The experience of God is had in our meeting with and love of other persons (Tallon 173). One becomes a knower through the other who is God. One becomes a lover through the other human being, and God is always present as co-loved (Tallon 174). aThe Waking" bears the same relationship to "Four for Sir John Davies" that uIt was beginning winter" bears to "The Lost Son." It is a reflection on what took place in ecstasy. Spirit and matter, thought and feeling, are not separate functions; even less are they functions which shrink or expand in inverse proportion to one another: "We think by feeling." Waking means coming away from the intense ex- perience. "I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow," that is, he returns to ordinary consciousness, savoring all that has happened. Something great has been learned through the experience, not in- dependent of it. "I learn by going where I have to go." What is learned is a lived experience of the relationship of spirit to matter, the flesh, the partner, nature and the world: spirit is not confined to the precincts of the private body. Waking to sleep is returning to those precincts after ecstasy. Other poems of Roethke fill out all that is not expressed about in- tersubjectivity in "Four for Sir John Davies." The dance represents sexuality and human relationships generally. It also suggests the risk of loss of self: "I'm a martyr to a motion not my own" (Poems 122). Activity and passivity, motion and non-self-directedness are inter- mingled. This makes him feel fulfillment, "In another being, at last" (121). Or, "I came to love, I came into my own" (115). Love diffuses his existence: "I find that love, and I am everywhere" (130). But there is risk involved. "Will the self, lost, be found again?" (130). The dy- namic of going out of self, suspension in the other and risk of loss, and return or coming into one's own, is the same in the poems of dance or sexuality as it is in the earlier stage of the greenhouse and regression. In sexuality and in social relationships generally, there is an over-</page><page sequence="13">ROBERT E. DOUD 51 coming of the boundaries of the body, the ordinary region in which selfhood is recognized. In relationships selfhood is realized in the other, and the other is welcomed within the perimeters and precincts of the self. The universe of the self is expanded through love. Tallon points out that, for Rahner, self-enactment is never a solitary, acosmic event (161). Tallon invokes comparisons of Rahner with Martin Buber, as Ross-Bryant compares Roethke and Buber (57f.). Rahner is metaphysically affirming that subjectivity requires inter- subjectivity in order even to be subjectivity (Tallon 163). The only kind of self- recovery that is ultimately self-enacting for a subject is one that follows upon autodonation to another. This autodonation in- volves the regression from original self-possession as discussed above, and reveals the eventual importance of regression and risk of self-loss or self-enactment. Identity in Roethke Identity is a concept that was important to Roethke, and what he meant by it amounts to the unique penetration of matter that is peculiar to each human spirit. In order to come into its own, realize itself, and become conscious of all of its dimensions, spirit must de- scend into matter, and in this process discover that darkness contains a light available nowhere else. This descent is really an ascent; this regression is really progress, or is at least the necessary means to psychological and spiritual progress. In a discussion of identity and modern poetry Roethke announces four themes: chaos, the self, imagination, and God. I take it that we are faced with at least four principal themes: (1) The multiplicity, the chaos of modern life; (2) The way, the means of establishing a personal identity, a self in the face of that chaos; (3) The nature of creation, that faculty for producing order out of disorder in the arts, particularly in poetry; and (4) The nature of God Himself. ("Identity" 19) The lesson in "Four for Sir John Davies" is that a harmonious world is not part of the modern reality. Life presents itself as mani- fold, as confusion. The self achieves identity by establishing a per- sonal order out of this chaos. The imagination is the usual name poets choose for the faculty and process of ordering reality (Scott 76-78). God is found in the recesses and processes of the imagination, not in projections outside of the self as in traditional religion. The movement of self as emanating spirit is not directed away from</page><page sequence="14">52 Religion &amp; Literature the chaos. The spirit brings order to the chaos. It brings light and joy; but what it illumines, orders, and enjoys is other than itself as well as part of itself. It journeys through otherness, resistance, and vis- cosity. It risks the self-loss of suspension in matter, learning how to go as it goes. Spirit is energized by desire, by "a real hunger for a reality more than the immediate: a desire not only for a finality, for a consciousness beyond the mundane, but a desire for quietude, a desire for joy" ("Identity" 19). Fascination with things, "the fetish of thinghood," slows down our progress: "we surround ourselves with junk, ugly objects endlessly repeated in an economy dedicated to waste" ("Identity" 19-20). The order of most of our modern institutions is really a chaos, something that threatens the truly human order of reality. Our desire needs to be kept undivided if it is to succeed. A kind of poverty is required for spiritual freedom if spirit is to penetrate matter fully (Bowers 64). Our identity depends upon our husbanding of our desire for what is essential. The fetish of thinghood, in which spirit is distracted from its own journey by a fascination with objects, is related to the reality of con- cupiscence as discussed by Karl Rahner ("Concupiscentia" 347). Con- cupiscence is the tendency of the higher powers to go limp and sur- render to the desires seated in the lower powers. Concupiscence on its positive side is simply sensibility, the togetherness of spirit and matter, viewed in its appetitive dimension. But when objects control our subjectivity, or when desires dominate the will, concupiscence ap- pears in its negative sense. Negative concupiscence is the tendency of dallying spirit to resist and postpone its own recovery, to delay its return, to prefer Ogygia to Ithaca. Roethke struggles to tell us what he means by the self: I am not speaking of the empirical self, the fleshbound ego; it's a single word: myself, the aggregate of the several selves, if you will. The spirit or soul- should we say the self, once perceived, becomes the soul? -this I was keeping "spare" in my desire for the essential. ("Identity" 21) Roethke is involved in a process of soul-making. The soul becomes other than itself in order to become itself; this is the meaning of the penetration of matter by spirit and chaos by order. Order risks loss of self in chaos, but the risk is essential if spirit is to come into its own. Matter is the medium of spirit's self-realization. The soul becomes many as it identifies with the many organisms of the world, but a higher unity is achieved, "the aggregate of the several selves."</page><page sequence="15">ROBERT E. DOUD 53 Incarnation, Mysticism, Death The third phase enumerated by Saltman, that of incarnation, is also one of mysticism. By incarnation he seems to mean a suffering God. He poignantly cites the line "And the hurricane drives the dead straw into the living pine-tree" {Poems 223), and interprets it as a sex- ual reference to the poet's wife and as a reference to the crucifixion (Saltman 154). There is an ambivalence of pleasure and pain here, of tenderness and violence, vacation and hurricane. The mystery of our suffering, particularly of our spiritual suffering, on its obverse is joy. Its darkness occasions a new kind of light. Here there is a fluctuating boundary between the self and God. The otherness of God is the most frightening darkness of all. In this spiritual midnight, aA man goes far to find out what he is" {Poems 231). The journey into God ends in the death of the self, but the death is not a loss. In this mystical experience "The mind enters itself, and God the mind, / And one is One, free in the tearing wind" {Poems 231 , Malkoff 210). The exhilaration of unity and the rending by the wind are the same experience. Mysticism then becomes like a dance and sexual experience {Poems 233). Here is stillness, not because spirit has detached itself from matter, but because spirit has penetrated every corner and recess of matter. Love and lust have become part of the process; physical desire has accompanied spiritual desire. The tearing wind may be death itself; indeed death is a major theme in Roethke's later poems. The rose {Poems 196) is the soul separated from the greenhouse, free in the tearing wind. The soul is not viewed as destroyed, but as liberated, fragile and surviving, un- protected from the elements and delicately resisting that with which it enters into relationship all the more profoundly. All the mystical poems which follow are attempts to understand death, which the poet prepares to embrace lovingly and decisively. Death will be the com- pletion of the poetic mission. There is a profound relationship between dying and the writing of poetry (Parini 48). Death is the ultimate worldly and human experi- ence, an experience in which the spirit finally and totally penetrates its matter, and moves beyond the zone of its own bodiliness. It is the kind of self-totalizing, self-giving, and self-expressing experience de- scribed in "The Rose." Technically, death is the dissipation of exis- tence: limply suspended in matter, the spirit is unable to recover itself, and melts away. Poetically, however, death is seen not to be the loss of self, but the ultimate integration and enactment of self. Here the distinction Rahner makes between practical words and primordial</page><page sequence="16">54 Religion &amp; Literature words is most dramatic. Death as a primordial word evokes the total meaning of life in a way that no other word can rival. Descriptions of clinical deaths can in no way approximate the shudder and promise that the full reality of death embraces. Only the poetic word can sym- bolize this. The mysticism of Roethke does not separate body and spirit. The celebration of its result is: "God bless the roots! - Body and soul are one! / The small become the great, the great the small" {Poems 242). This mysticism of integration and mutual inclusion is also the theme of the most beautiful and profound of Roethke's poems, "The Rose." The place is of the utmost importance, "where sea and fresh water meet." The rose is "Rooted in stone, keeping the whole of light, / Gathering to itself sound and silence- / Mine and the sea- wind's" (Poems 196-99). The rose is vulnerable, out beyond all protection and facing into the tearing wind. Delicate, it resists and survives, but for how long? It occasions the poet's deepest self-understanding: Among the half-dead trees, I came upon the true ease of myself, As if another man appeared out of the depths of my being, And I stood outside myself, Beyond becoming and perishing, A something wholly other, As I swayed out on the wildest wave alive, And yet was still. It helps him later say: "The edge is what we have" (Poems 250). Roethke brings home the meaning of his experience of this single rose and its context when he compares it to the myriad roses in his father's greenhouse (Poems 197). They flowed together toward him and beck- oned him out of himself, helped him overcome any regression. This is the edge between life and death, light and darkness, and between all mutually supporting ambiguities, the edge between body and soul, the most important of all places, the place where being gushes into language, where silence and sound meet. There is no need of another place of fulfillment: "What need for heaven, then, / With that man, and those roses?" If there is a God, he is a God of earth, who brings earthly body and spirit together, and is felt where they best come together. This is not a God of separations, but of integrations. The place of the rose in the sea wind replaces heaven, a haven for pure spirits. The human is at length a "thingy spirit" (Poems 88), one fulfilled in its flesh, not imprisoned in its body. In his final poems Roethke is struggling with the meaning of death,</page><page sequence="17">ROBERT E. DOUD 55 and he rejects the notion of it as a separation of spirit and matter. Death, for him, must be a strengthening of the relationship between body and soul. Rahner views death as an event concerning the whole person. It is not simply a separation of body and soul, although the soul is no longer the vital principle of this living body. Death is an event in which the free, human, personal aspect at last thoroughly penetrates our given, prepersonal, natural aspect. The human soul in death is not viewed as "acosmic," but as "all-cosmic." The soul achieves what Rahner calls an "open relationship" to the universe. During this life it cannot realize all the possibilities of relatedness to others, but after death the soul continues to strengthen its relationship to matter, to the world, to the universe, in ways which were not possi- ble during life. The unity Roethke felt with all living things as phases of his personal appropriation of evolution is now achieved in a more real way. Dying is a way in which the poet stands out of himself- in the lilac, the bird, the dolphin. The lilac continues to change; the bird is greeted by the air as he flies; the dolphin rises from the darkening waves (Poems 199). The human spirit enjoys a relationship to the universe which transcends its relationship to its body, and death is the opportunity to explore this relationship (Death 31). For Rahner, every Christian death is a martyrdom, a witness to what lies beyond (Death 109). It is an opening to new possibilities of relationship to God and to creation. Death is a sacrament of sorts, which bodies forth a personal faith and commitment. Death is always extraordinary, unique, and dramatic. Each death is a social act, belonging to the Church and to humanity, and it can be a gift of self given as such by the individual. Roethke refers to dead poets like Yeats, Blake, and Davies, who have communion with him and con- tinue their poetic mission through him (LaBelle 6 passim, Bowers 32f.). The journey to complete identity is transformed in death, but it goes on on the other side of death. The relationship between Rahner and Roethke is a concord of sen- sibility which is a cognitive agreement as well, worked out in one medium by a theologian and in another by a poet. The incarnational mysticism of the older Roethke, and Rahner's theology of death, dis- play a sensibility in which life is so deep and extensive that it appro- priates death as part of its own process, and stretches out toward the unknown with the expectation that it is richer than the known. And they do this without naivete, without the suppression of suffering. In- terpreting Roethke through Rahner can give us a poetry which serves as an anonymous foundation to theology. Placing Rahner beside</page><page sequence="18">56 Religion &amp; Literature Roethke offers a view of theology as that which reveals the ultimate source of poetry. Such a poetry, and such a theology, alike bear wit- ness to the mysterious burst of meaning into life which alone grounds the understanding and celebration of life itself.
