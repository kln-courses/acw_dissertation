<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gregorianum 87,3 (2006) 487-521 Gn 1:26-27 in Augustine and Luther: «Before you are my strength and my weakness» Augustine's reading of Gn 1:26-27 is generally associated with his trini tarian interpretation of human dignity. The theologian's mind races back to Augustine's analysis of the human interiority and even the human body, as he drew parallels to explain how the human person has truly been made in the image of the Triune God, as Genesis seems to imply. But this was only the end-result of a lifelong struggle through which he tried to understand what Revelation has to say about the human condition as the Creator in tended it to be. Augustine's dose encounter with Genesis started well before his bap tism in 387: gradually, it turned into a major interest throughout the rest of his long, and eventful life. As Augustine the bishop reflected first on his youth, then on his young adulthood and, later, on his subsequent mature encounter with the God whom he learned to love 'so late', he was constant ly grappling with a doublé issue: (a) how could he know that he had pro perly understood the two creation accounts? And (b) how could he com municate - and place at the service of his fellow Christians - ali the he had been able to understand? May I hear and understand how in the beginning you made heaven and earth (Gn 1:1). Moses wrote this. He wrote this and went his way, passing out of this world from you to you. He is not now before me, but if he were, I would clasp him and ask him and through you beg him to explain to me the creation. [...] If he spoke Hebrew, he would in vain make an impact on my sense of hearing, for the sounds would not touch my mind at ali. If he spoke Latin, I would know what he meant. Yet how would I know whether or not he was telling me the truth?1 The young bishop knew that he had to share his reflections on the re trieval of the two creation narratives and expound the origine of creation, and of his own self. He could have chosen to do that systematically, as any 'Augustine, ConfessionsXI,3,5 (Η.

On the contrary, he chose to write his Confessions. Augustine, conse quently, opted to narrate his own life as if it were some story, or some case study (Books 1-9). Having done that, he invited his readers to join him in pursuing their common quest and, together, retrieve the profound insights of the creation accounts (Books 10-13). He knew quite well, that many would like to fathom the one origin of ali that is. The Vetus Latina - the version of Genesis the Church had then begun using - had sounded so inelegant and barbarie that the nineteen year old catechumen took the deersion to stay away from the orthodox community in North Africa and seek a 'better' way to God elsewhere.2 He found refuge in Manichean esoteric doctrines, as they seemed to be more plausible re trievals of that same text. The young orator, though, stili held on to his sta tus of catechumen; his mother, Monica, had enrolled him into the program as he was growing up. At the time, being a catechumen accorded him a cer tain status in the post-Constantinian world. But the years he stayed with the Manichees proved to be difficult: once he had joined and become a member of that group, no one seemed either to have the time or to be will ing to accompany him and answer his never ending questions. When the thirty year old professor of rhetoric took up his now post at the imperiai court in Milan, he carne into dose contact with Ambrose, the influential and caring pastor of that city. It was through Ambrose that Augustine mas tered the use of the allegory as the key to biblical hermeneutics. Finally, he could read and appreciate the Sacred Scriptures, and even come to grips with the riddie of e vii and its presence, something that Manicheism had failed to clarify. On completing the Confessions, the bishop of Hippo continued to as sess his retrieval of Gn 1 and labour under his own theological dissatisfac tion. Once again, he invested precious time and energy into the study of Genesis, especially the very first pages of the Bible. The issues he stili had to deal with were (a) the authorship of Genesis and its meaning, (b) an ac cess restricted to the Latin translations of the Scriptures, and (c) the inter pretation of the divine truths the texts meant to convey. Ili at ease with the two commentaries he had already composed as a fresh convert and a new ly ordained priest, he launched himself on his epoch making commentary: The Literal Meaning of Genesis. He had already started working on The 2 The Vetus Latina, which the North African Church used at the time, was a very crudely translated work; according to Augustine, it was «unworthy in comparison with the dignity of Cicero». He considered it «something neither open to the proud nor laid bare to mere chil dren; a text lowly to the beginner but, on further reading, of mountainous difficulty and en veloped in mysteries» (ConfessionsIII, 5,9).</page><page sequence="3">AUGUSTINE AND LUTHER 489 Trinity, when he embarked on his Genesis commentary.3 In his other clas sic, The City ofGod, he often referred to humanity as being created in God's image.4 When, in 1512, Luther was appointed to the chair of Biblical Studies at Wittenberg's new university, he dedicated his first lectures to first hook of Moses, Genesis.5 Ten years later, he took up the same biblical text - the one he loved most6 - in a cycle of sermons he delivered between 1523 and 1524. In the summer months of 1527, he hastily edited and published these ser mons under the title In Genesin Mosi librum sanctissimum Decìamationes. His very last work - the fruit of his mature years between June 1, 1535 and November 17, 1545 - was what became widely known as Luther's Great Commentary on Genesis. Luther delivered these university lectures after he had already translated the Hebrew Bible into German and insofar as his fading health allowed him to. While the first part was published during his lifetime, the rest saw the light after some heavy-handed editing by his dose collaborators. This task, though, drained his waning strength and, on the day of his final lecture, he concluded his undertaking with the words: «God grant that after me others will do better. I can do no more. I am weak. Pray God for me that He may grant me a good and blessed last hour».7 Both Augustine and Luther addressed a Christian audience. Both had to do their best, cater to and nourish two separate and sometimes contra dictory audiences. They certainly wrote with the intent of dialoguing with the research world of the time and with those who wanted to deepen their own intellectual knowledge and skills. But they also had in mind ali those individuai believers who wanted to grow further in their faith.8 Though in 3 The demanding theological speculation that led to The Trinity did not dampen Augus tine's spirits, nor did it keep him away from an old dream of his: a proper commentary on Genesis. As things turned out, he wrote his The Literal Meaning ofGenesis (De Genesi ad Litte ram libri duodecimi between 401 and 416, finishing it before his opus on the Trinity. 4 Book XI of The City ofGod deals with creatìon and takes up themes related to the six-day account; Book XII provides a commentary on the creation of intellectual beings (the angeis and humanity), from whom originates the human city of God. This classic was composed around the year 416. In the same opus, Augustine groped for an eschatological understanding of man's cre ation as God's image: life leads towards a progressive union with Christ. As the passage from a 'mirrar image' to a 'face-to-face relationship' with God, it brings God's creation to perfection. 5 Unfortunately, the text of Luther's first lectures seems to have been lost. 6 «In the entire Bible there is nothing more beautiful than the Book of Genesis» (II, 1022); as quoted in P.

As this contribution tries to delve deeper into the hermeneutic of hu man dignity, it limits itself to Augustine's and Luther's exposition of Genesis 1,26-27, two verses that constitute the climax of the first creation narrative. Going beyond a simple reformulation of a biblica! text, both Augustine and Luther tried to measure their own comprehension of humanity with the Church's regula fidei, as they expounded Revelation's tenets and allowed their own faith to seek a better understanding of the human condition. We will therefore try to address two major issues: (a) the method both authors used to retrieve the biblical text into their own milieu, and (b) the way they matured their own understanding of the two verses of Genesis. Augustine A tiferai reading of Genesis Augustine began his first, unfinished commentary on Genesis with words that expressed some of the innermost feelings of the newly ordained priest. They turned into words that, later on, continued to haunt the bish op's pastoral care. The obscure mysteries of the naturai order, which we perceive to have been made by God the almighty craftsman, should rather be discussed by asking questions than by making afSrmations. This is supremely the case with the books which have been entmsted to us by divine authority, because the rash assertion of one's uncertain and dubious opinions in dealing with them can scarcely avoid the charge of sacrilege.9 While creation touches upon the very roots of human existence, the Sacred Scriptures constitute the wellspring of Christian faith. With an acute sense of questioning and the finesse of a good orator, Augustine summed up, in the form of a brief dialogue, his own speculative faith: Behold, I prayed God. And what would you like to know? Ali these things I have been praying about. Formulate them briefly. I desire to know God and the soul. Nothing else? Nothing at ali.10 9 Unflnished Literal Commentary on Genesis (De Genesi ad Litteram imperfectus liber) 1,1, in J.E. Rotelle (ed.), Saint Augustine. On Genesis, New York, 2002, 114.

When understood in terms of Augustine's Neoplatonic comprehen sion of existence, the soul constitutes the apex and vital force of the created order; it also accounts for that spiritual 'substance' which permits the whole of creation to approach and contemplate God. As the human soul seeks God, it enters into a relationship of truth and love with its Creator. Were it to understand God incorrectly, it could find itself lost within some meaning less labyrinth, something that runs parallel to the experience of Augustine's Manichean years. Its outcome could only be sacrilege, that is, the transgres sion of that honour and love that humanity should proffer to God. Before tackling theological issues, seekers need to make up their minds as to the method they should adopt when they approach biblical texts. Augustine himself distinguished between a literal and an allegorical understanding of the biblical story. Though he consistently sought a literal understanding of the text, with hindsight he deemed his first reading of Genesis (in his two-book refutation of Manicheismi to be an allegorical in terpretation. At the time - Augustine commented in later years - he «did not dare illustrate in their literal meaning so many mysteries of the naturai order».11 Augustine set himself to that very task, when he started working on his unfinished commentary: he explicitly wanted it to be a literal reading of Genesis. But, by the time he was commenting on Gn 1:26-27, he suc cumbed under the burden. The private study of Genesis he had done, shortly after his ordination to the priesthood, did not prove either ade quate or satisfactory. When the bishop took up the challenge for the third time, he decided not to revise his unfinished commentary, but to make a clean start. His goal continued to be that of providing «not the allegorical meanings of the text, but the proper assessment of what actually hap pened».12 When he interpreted the creation of darkness in Gn 1:4 as the sin of rational creatures (angels) and light as their restoration, Augustine quickly chided himself as follows: But this is an interpretation on the lines of prophetic allegory [sed haec allego riae propheticae disputatio est\, which is not what we have undertaken in this work. We undertook, you see, to talk here about the scriptures according to 11 «Cum de Genesi duos libros contra Manichaeos condidissem, quoniam secundum al legoricam significationem Scripturae verba tractaveram, non ausus naturalium rerum tanta secreta ad litteram exponere, hoc est quemadmodum possent secundum historicam propri etatem quae ibi dieta sunt accipi, volui experiri in hoc quoque negotiosissimo ac difflcillimo opere quid valerem» (Retractationum libri duo 1,18). Rotelle translates this title as Revisions. 12 «Titulus eorum librorum inscribitur: De Genesi ad litteram, id est non secundum alle goricas significationes, sed secundum rerum gestarum proprietatem» (Ibid., 11,24; Rotelle 167).</page><page sequence="6">492 MARIO FARRUGIA their proper meaning of what actually happened [secundum proprietatem re rum gestarum], noi according to their riddling enigmatic reference to future events [non secundum aenigmatafuturarum].13 When Augustine was learning from Ambrose the method of the allego ry, he underwent an experience of being set free from several preconcep tions. Ambrose also assisted his catechumen, as the latter learnt to accept and love the very texts he had earlier detested and frowned upon. Ambrose showed him how to encounter the meaning of the Old Testament in the New: prophecy - or hindsight - could clarify many obtuse and unfatho mable texts. Even the Old Testament itself resorted to allegory as method and relied on prophecy as the key to encounter meaning; through allegory, the meaning of a text can only reside in some subsequent (or future) event.14 While a specific text may at first sight appear enigmatic, in the light of Christ's mystery the interpreter can find the necessary tools to compre hend that very text. In Christ, Augustine learned, every biblical riddle en counters its perfect and complete clarification and resolution. Medieval theology could eventually equate the allegorical reading of the Scriptures with the christological interpretation of those same texts. When the mature Augustine wanted to forego allegory and exert him self toward the literal interpretation of Genesis, the methods he used were radically different from those currently employed by post-critical exegesis. Working toward a literal comprehension of a text, a third millennium scholar would opt for a formai, structural and linguistic analysis that would rarely go beyond the particular context of the one hook under scrutiny. This would be even more the case when the contemporary researcher delves deeply into the first two chapters of Genesis. The two creation nar ratives belong to different traditions, arose in different epochs, and resort ed to diverse theological concepts and expressions. Augustine the orator understood quite well that, in the first pages of the Bible, two creation stories had been placed side by side, but he cannot be held responsible of being unaware of modem biblical hermeneutics. He also firmly believed both accounts to be factual. And such a belief quickly turned into an impossible riddle.15 How could God create the same things 13 The Literal Meaning of Genesis 1,17,34; Rotelle 183. 14 In On Genesis: a Refutation ofthe Manichees, Augustine read Gn 1 first «as the account of things done» (tamquam historiam rerum factarum), and then «as predicting things to come in the future» (ut praedicationem futurorum) (1,23,41; Rotelle 66). He first took up the first Genesis narrative and commented on each verse (according to the story); he then interpreted the whole, showing how the six days of creation stood for the six diverse ages of the world. The creation of humanity prophetically evoked the founding of the Church as the last era or the world, prior to Christ's second coming. There would follow the seventh day of rest and peace, that knows no end. 15 Cf Augustine's proposai of the rationes primordiales or causales, below.</page><page sequence="7">AUGUSTINE AND LUTHER 493 twice over? The explanation, Augustine was groping for, had to demonstrate how both narratives were objective and authentic; he could never contem plate any other solution, as that would have meant holding that the written word of God could even lead its readers astray. He found the key to a solu tion in his Neoplatonic understanding of the intellect, and/or the soul. Augustine also firmly believed that Moses was the one human author of the whole Pentateuch. That compounded further his problems, as he himself could not read the bible in its originai languages. When in 396 he was ordained bishop-coadjutor of Hippo Regius, his linguistic frustrations must have been ali the more evidenti Valerius, the bishop who had chosen him as his coadjutor, could stili handle Greek. And yet Augustine's literal understanding of the Bible did not seek di rect access to the human author of the Pentateuch, with 'Moses'. He wanted to get in touch with the primary author of the Scriptures, with God himself. Analysing the biblical text, Augustine tried to understand the meaning God wanted to convey to his people, at the time when Genesis was being written. Prophecy and allegory do imply a second audience: though a text may be addressed to one, it is only the second, subsequent audience that can grasp the meaning of that very text. That might imply a second, succes sive revelation on God's part, which could never form part of God's originai revelation. Augustine wanted at ali costs to avoid such a hermeneutic; it would have meant that God's people could not understand God's word as it was originally addressed to them. That is why Augustine frowned upon the allegorical, and championed the literal interpretation of the Bible. Prophecy and / or allegory could make their comeback at a later stage, as theological reflection. In no way did Augustine want to rule them out: they would only constitute a second, deeper understanding of a text. Theology today would refer to such a second procedure as to the sensus plenior of a text: that is, the meaning a text conveys, within the totality of God's revelation. Augustine wanted to (a) assert the truth of ali that had come to be and (b) defend the Genesis narratives as faithful accounts of ali that happened at the beginning of time. To do so, within a controversial setting, he had to discard any figurative or rhetorical meaning. If Genesis 1 were to be seen as some mere symbol, he would be playing once more into the hands of the Manichees. He correctly understood that the content of a text went well beyond the mere literal account, and could (i) suggest 'eternai realities', (ii) recount deeds, (iii) foretell future events, as well as (iv) indicate some moral course of action.16 While working on his The Literal Meaning of Genesis, Augustine the bishop formulated clearly and brilliantly his exegetical method and the cri 16 On Genesis: a Refutation of the Manichees, 1,1,1.</page><page sequence="8">494 MARIO FARRUGIA teria with which he could retrieve the meaning God had originally intend ed for his people. Biblical scholars would first need to deepen their under standing of a particular biblical writer, together with the latter's particular milieu. Linguistic critique and heuristic appraisal would constitute the sec ond step, even though researchers could only handle these approaches to the best of their abilities. Ultimately though, the rule of faith had to be the decisive criterion that guided and motivated the Christian interpreter, as the latter weighed each single word or construct, and penetrateti its 'hid den' meaning.17 When we read in the divine books such a vast array of true meanings, which can be extracted from a few words, and which are backed by sound Catholic faith, we should pick above ali the one which can certainly be shown to have been held by the author we are reading; while if this is hidden from us, then surely the one which the scriptural context does not rule out and which is agreeable to sound faith; but even if the scriptural context cannot be worked out and assessed, then at least only one which sound faith prescribes. It is one thing, after ali, not to be able to work out what the writer is most likely to have meant, quite another to stray away from the road sign-posted by godliness.18 Faith raises questions, stimulates the interpreter's curiosity and points to the sure path that leads to God. Exegesis, according to Augustine, is the result of one's listening God and his word: «The truth of God invites to faith through human language».19 God himself is the author to be studied, with in his own milieu! Inasmuch as this is fldes ex auditu, it deepens the under standing of a God already encountered, and a divine word already heard and welcomed as God's own. «May I hear and understand how in the be ginning you made heaven and earth (Gn 1,1)» Augustine stated, in his de sire to fathom the first creation account.20 Michael Fiedrowicz explains it very succinctly: «The text was only an authority that mediated between God as speaker and the human being as hearer».21 Approaching literally a biblical text meant for Augustine moving beyond that same text to contem plate the Truth in person, God himself. The God who spoke though the Bible is the same one who had created the universe, and ali the «obscure mysteries of the naturai order». The object of Augustine's literal reading could never be the narrative itself but the God who did the speaking. No wonder, then, that Augustine's own evaluation of his exegetical work on Genesis was as follows: 17 CfB.M. Litfin, «TheRule of Faith in Augustine» in Pro Ecclesia 14 (2005) 85-101. 18 The Literal Meaning ofGenesis 1,21,41 ; Rotelle 188-9. 19 «Veritas Dei per humanam locutionem invitat ad fldem» (The Trìnity, IX,12,17).

He could not form part, any longer, of a group that forbade open questions and repressed open discus sione. A kind of anti-intellectualism then pervaded his Church, something he fought against through ministry and writing throughout the rest of his life. The Manichees promoted the idea of an ineffable God who could not debase himself toward matter, as it was completely under the control of the Evil One. Notwithstanding the fact that this God could not have created the universe, in the cosmic struggle against evil he succeeded in placing a spark of light in every human being. After Augustine the teenager had re jected blind faith and sought understanding among heretics, it did not take him too many years to find out that even the Manichees reiterated slogane and were truly intimidated by his questioning mind. [After reading Cicero's Hortensius), mists never disappeared completely, so that I lacked orientation [...]. At the time, a childish superstition frightened me from asking questions. Growing up a little, I swept away that mist and con vinced myself that it was better to follow teachers than authoritarian fìgures. I encountered in some for whom the light is not what the eyes see, but has to be sought among supreme, divine realities. I could not agree. I thought, though, they might be hiding something in their concepts [involucris] toward which they might someday lead. When, after I had discussed at length these things, I fled away from them especially by crossing this sea, for a span of time acade mics were in total control of my life, as it tossed among currents and fought ali kinds. It was thereafter, that I carne to these lands; it was here that I acknow ledged my polar star to which I could entrust myself. For I could often under stand in what the bishop and you [Manlius Theodorus] said, that when we think of God, we cannot posit any corporeal reality, not even the soul, even though among things it may come closest to God.23 22 «In quo opere plura quaesita quam inventa sunt, et eorum quae inventa sunt pauciora firmata, cetera vero ita posita, velut adhuc requirenda sint» (Revisions 11,24; Rotelle 167). 23 «Sed neque mihi nebulae defuerunt, quibus confunderetur cursus meus [...]. Nam et superstitio quaedam puerilis me ab ipsa inquisitione terrebat: et ubi factus erectior, illam caliginem dispuli, mihique persuasi docentibus potius quam iubentibus esse credendum; in cidi in homines quibus lux ista quae oculis cernitur, inter summe divina colenda videretur.

Deinde veni in has ter</page><page sequence="10">496 MARIO FARRUGIA Tutoring Augustine into the method of allegory, Ambrose also taught him what subsequent theology refers to as 'analogy'. No one can directly posit anything material, or conceptual, of God himself. «There are no words [...] that can possibly describe how God made and established hea ven and earth and every creature which he set in place there», Augustine declared.24 The Manichees despised Christians for their belief that God cre ated humanity in his image, as if God himself possessed «nostrils and teeth and a beard». Augustine the layman reacted unequivocally against his for mer colleagues, as he added: «Ali those who have a spiritual understanding of the scriptures have learned to take these [God's eyes, lips, feet, etc.] as meaning not parts of the body but spiritual powers».25 After his conversion, Augustine the seeker could stomach only with great diffìculty the fact that he had fallen for the Manichees, as they evoked blind trust in their own religious tenets. How could one speak of the cre ator, the ineffable God? At the end of his opus on the Trinity, Augustine prayed: «Give me the strength to seek. You have caused me to find you, and have given me the hope of finding you more and more. Before you are my strength and my weakness; preserve the one, heal the other. Before you are my knowledge and my ignorance: where You have opened to me, receive me when I enter; where you have closed, open to me where I knock».26 Through Ambrose' assistance and God's loving acceptance, Augustine thus completed a full cycle: his faith-seeking-understanding had gradually led him to God's love, and to a blind trust in the One whose love precedes every human thought, word and action. Augustine identifìed this God, Truth in person, with the God of Genesis. In perfect antithesis to Manichean theology, the newly baptised Augustine - stili a lay person - proclaimed the Father creating in Christ as the God of Genesis l.27 Quoting directly John's Prologue (1:1-3) and Jn 8:25, Augustine identifìed Christ ras; hic septentrionem cui me crederem didici. Animadverti enim et saepe in sacerdotis nostri, et aliquando in sermonibus tuis, cum de Deo cogitaretur, nihil omnino corporis esse cogitan dum, neque cum de anima; nam id est unum in rebus proximum Deo» (De Beata Vita liber unus, 1,4). This is a constructed dialogue, set on November 13, 386, the date of Augustine's 32nd birthday and less than six months before his baptism. Augustine reconsidered the path that had led him to baptism, and reformulated his philosophical ideas in the light of his new faith. Together with Ambrose and Simplicianus, the consul Flavius Manlius Theodorus constituted for Augustine a living example of how Neoplatonism could lead toward a better understanding of the Christian faith. 24 On Genesis: a Refutation ofthe Manichees, 1,23,41; Rotelle 64. 25 Ibid., 1,17,27; Rotelle 57. 26 «Tu da quaerendi vires, qui inveniri te fecisti, et magis magisque inveniendi te spem dedisti.

Coram te est scientia et ignorantia mea: ubi mihi aperuisti, suscipe intrantem; ubi clausisti, aperi pulsanti» (On the Trinity, XIV,28,51). 27 On Genesis: a Refutation ofthe Manichees, 1,2,3; Rotelle 40.</page><page sequence="11">AUGUSTINE AND LUTHER 497 himself as the beginning of ali there is. He again interpreted interpreted Gn 1:1 in the light of New Testament revelation, though this time he did that for doctrinal reasons. In his The Trinity, Augustine returned to the same train of thought and expressed it with greater clarity as he adopted the ter minology of Phil 2:6-11 : In the form of God, he [the Word] made man; in the form of a slave, he was made man. For if the Father alone had made man without the Son, it would have not been written: «Let us make man to our image and likeness».28 A major shift occurred in Augustine's theology: he now spoke of the second Person of the Trinity, without implying his future Incarnation. Free ing his interpretation from allegory and prophecy, Augustine dwelt on the major distinction between the Son as preceding and creating time, and the incarnation that took place within time. Already in the Unfinished Literal Commentary on Genesis, he had reassessed the role of the Father and the Son at creation, adding a new, important constituent: the Holy Spirit was the one to suggest, to both Father and Son, the words «Let [...] be made [fìat]» (Gn 1, passim) and «Let us make [...] [faciamus]» (Gn 1:26).29 Creation, therefore, is the work of the three divine Persone. The newly ordained priest already held the interpretative key that would show him the way, in his later commentaries. If the Word is the beginning (Gn 1:1) through whom creation carne to be, then the Father creates in the Son through the Holy Spirit. God himself is eternity in person. It was in The Literal Meaning of Gen esis that, for the first time, Augustine clearly read «Let us make man in our image» of Gn 1:26 as a clear indication of a «plurality of persons [...] on ac count of Father and Son and Holy Spirit». «Image», he contended, is in the singular and cannot simply be a parallelism of that plurality of divine Per sons. Consequently, Augustine felt that the uniqueness of the image de manded a unity within God. He thus saw that Gn 1:26 clearly indicates the Trinity as one and that the three Persons act ad extra as one subject.30 Was Augustine already hinting at his triadic, psychological analyses of human interiority, something he developed later on, in The Trinity? Cer tainly, he was careful enough to draw a perfect parallelism between the unity within God and the integrity of the image. He also knew quite well that humanity's relationship with God could never be on par with inter trinitarian relations: humanity relates with God as one and passes through the mediation of the unity of God.31 28 The Trinity, 1,7,14; cf. 1,8,18. 25 16,56; Rotelle 147. 30 The Literal Meaning of Genesis, 111,19,29.

Augustine's understanding of the unity of God - as mediating between</page><page sequence="12">498 MARIO FARRUGIA Eventually, Augustine developed extensively the reverse side of a Trini tarian reading of Gn 1:26. If the three Persone did create ali together, the human person could not have been made in the image of just one of them: humanity must be (i) the one image, (ii) of the one God, (iii) in three Per sone.32 In his seminai work on the Trinity, he developed extensively what he had merely outlined in The Literal Meaning of Genesis. He rephrased the above as follows: «"Let us make" and "our" are said in the plural [...] that the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit might make to the image of the Fa ther, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, in order that man might subsist as the image of God. But God is the Trinity».33 He then pushed himself to the ut most, as he examined in depth the triadic constitution of the human soul and discovered eventual traces of the Trinity even in the body, the human physical constitution. But did it really happen in this order? Was The Trinity a subsequent development to The Literal Meaning of Genesisl Augustine himself de clared that he began his commentary on Genesis when he had already been working on his The Trinity, he also added that he completed his com mentary before the latter. The Literal Meaning of Genesis, 111,19,29 can therefore be considered more than just an earlier formulation of what he developed more extensively in The Trinity. Augustine would have made use of his further research on Genesis, as he was trying to bring his work on The Trinity io completion. The Image and the 'Rationes Causales' The rendering of Gn 1:26-27 that Augustine had at his disposai differs somewhat from the originai Hebrew text. the Trinitarian relations ad intra and the rest of creation - constitutes the coming of age of Western theology as distinct from that of Eastern Christianity. While the Eastern Fathers never contemplated any other kind of relations but those that belonged to the economy (from the Father through the Son in the Spirit), Western theology dwelt much more on God's unity than on the believer's way of access to the Trinity. 32 The Trinity, XII,6,7. 33 Ibid., VII,6,12. Augustine continued with the utmost care: «But because this image of God was not made equal in every respect, as not born of him but created by him, in order to signify this, he is called an image in the sense that he is made to the image, that is, he is made equal by parity, but approaches it by a kind of similarity» (Ibid.; cf XII,6,6-7). In IX,2,2, he re ferred to man as the 'unequal' (impar) image of God (cfX,12,19).</page><page sequence="13">AUGUSTINE AND LUTHER 499 Augustine's VERSION Translation [26] Et dixit Deus: faciamus hominem ad imaginem et similitudinem nos tram, et habeat potestatema piscium maris et volatilium coeli et omnium pecorum et omnis terrae et omnium reptilium repentium super terram [27] Et fecit Deus hominemb ad imaginem Dei masculum et feminamc fecit eum; fecit [28] et benedixit eos Deus... ,34 Then God said, «Let us make man in our image and our likeness; and let him have dominiona over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over ali the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth». So God created manb to the image of God; he made him male and femalec; God created them and blessed them... ,35 The Latin version that Augustine had at his disposai carries two vari ante, without which scholars today would find it hard to understand his theological interpretation of Gn 1:26-27. (1) This version correctly translated the originai Hebrew «and he will have dominion» (a). Current translations prefer to put that in the plural, so that it may run parallel to the «male and iemale» in Gn 1:27 (c). (2) It looks as if the same Latin translator wanted to avoid the pleonastic use of «in his own image», as it recurred twice in the Hebrew originai. That meant that 34 This is the Latin version that Augustine himself carried in his The Literal Meaning of Genesis, 111,19,29 andVI,2,3 (cf also VI,5,8 andVI,8,13); cf PL 34:291 and 339-340. 35 The RSV translates Gn 1:26-27 as follows: «Then God said, "Let us make man in our ima ge, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over ali the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps up on the earth". So God created man in his oum image, in the image of God he createci him; male and iemale he created them». Underlined are the differences between Augustine's text and a contemporary reading of the originai Hebrew. Preferring to translate Gn 1: 26-27 as Augustine himself did in The TrinityX\lfi,8, Edmund Hill refers to such Augustine's punctuation as the lat terà «own idiosyncratic punctuation». See Rotelle 233, footnote 28. The criticai edition of De Genesi ad litteram libri duodecim can be found in P. Agaésse and A. Solignac (edd.), La Genèse au sens lettéral en douze livres, Paris, 1972; it is the re-edition of CSEL 28. On pp. 256 and 258, it carries Augustine's text as follows «Et dixit Deus: faciamus hominem ad imaginem et simili tudinem nostrani; et dominetur piscium maris et uolatilium caeli et omnium pecorum et om nis terrae et omnium reptilium repentium super terram. Et fecit Deus hominem, ad imaginem Dei fecit eum: masculum et feminam fecit eos». This version, though in accordance with cur rent biblical exegesis, does not sustain the text as Augustine had read and understood it.</page><page sequence="14">500 MARIO FARRUGIA God's creation of man (b) continued with the words «in the image of God», while the second part of Gn 1:27 read: «he created him male and iemale». In so doing, the translator destroyed the originai Hebrew play on words that very carefully drew a perfect doublé between the first and middle parts of verse 27. That translator had the concrete «male and iemale» - in the third part of the same verse - explain the rather abstract concept of the 'image'. (3) Besides, Augustine could hardly have guessed that a Hebrew word had gone missing! Consequently, he assumed that God gave domi nion to the one human image (b), before it was ever articulated as «male and iemale» (c). Augustine divided his first commentary - On Genesis: a Refutation of the Manichees - into two books, each taking one of the two creation narra tives. When considering the image, he mainly refuted the Manichean criti cism that Christianity forces anthropomorphism onto the transcendent God. Then, he summarily drew the oudine of his future theological thought, as he added: «When man is said to have been made to the image of God, it is said with reference to the interior man, where reason is to be found and intelligence». Though Augustine was clearly banking on his un derlying philosophical comprehension, he started interpreting the narra tive of Gn 1 as a spiritual creation: whatever our senses do perceive only carne to be in the second creation account. God, Augustine insisted, gave humanity dominion over the rest of creation on account of the latter's spi ritual prowess and potency: «Ali the other animale, after ali, are not subject to us on account of the body, but on account of the intelligence, which we have and they do not».36 Augustine the layman punctiliously added that the dominion, which humanity knows and experiences, is that reserved to the fallen hu mankind: the dominion that God originally intended belonged to «that perfection which he [man] had when made to God's image». Hence, it fol lows that God's originai blessing of humanity (Gn l:28ff) should be taken «in a spiritual sense as well».37 In plain and simple words, Augustine under stood human fife before the fall as having been fashioned according to the lofty neoplatonic ideals of happiness and tranquillity, harmony and beauty. It also explained why humanity is the climax of God's creation and why it received dominion over the Creator's handiwork. Augustine stopped writing his Unfinished Literal Commentary on Gene sis, when he started to tackle the biblical concepts of image and likeness. The «pre-eminence of reason» is again the key. Faced with apparent syn onyms and having to justify the facticity of both, Augustine thought that 5 On Genesis: a Refutation ofthe Manichees, 1,17,28; Rotelle 57. 7 Ibid., 1,18,29 and 1,19,30, respectively; Rotelle 58.</page><page sequence="15">AUGUSTINE AND LUTHER 501 image [imago) could be something real and concrete, even when it was made of a substance different from that of its originai. He then treated the concept likeness (similitudo) as abstract. Hence, in as much as humanity is made in God's image, it constitutes the climax and the highest perfection among creatures. Augustine interpreted the image as expressing humanity's basic rela tionality with the creator. Likeness, on the contrary, accounts for each indi viduai human relationship with the rest of God's creation, with those crea tures over which God calls humanity to exercise its dominion. When God created and imposed the form he wanted on every single creature, a cer tain likeness carne to be in every single thing God fashioned. Through par ticipation, the soul or mind - the «innermost and principal element in hu manity» - is by far greater than the likeness found in any other creature. It also «holds the leading place in human nature» itself (that is, it controls the body). Augustine could consequently apply to humanity the fact that, within God, 'person' stood for distinction; likeness, therefore, should also account for the diversity that exists between many single individuale, even though humans are ali made to God's likeness.38 Another important consideration stems from the fact that humanity is made, not begotten, in God's image. Though both the Word and humanity exist as God's image, there should be an unbridgeable disparity between the begetting of the eternai Image - the Word - and the creation of the hu man person 'in God's image'. It is likeness that constitutes and accounts for either closeness or distance between God and the human person: «For one does not approach God across intervals of space but by likeness, and by unlikeness he draws away from him. For there are some who distinguish in such a way that they will have the Son to be the image, but man to be not an image, but to the image».39 In The Literal Meaning of Genesis, Augustine's interpretation of Gn 1:26-27 attained its most profound formulation.40 As bishop, Augustine had continued to deepen his understanding of the creation accounts, even though his main intent was then the clarification of their content accord 38 Unflnished Literal Commentary on Genesis, 57-60. The last, Augustine wrote, was the analogica! application to humanity of the distinction between Father and Son: though the Son is like the Father, the Son is not the Father. But he quickly added that the divine Persons are one, something that cannot be applied to human persons. After an interruption of some 36 years, Augustine added a final paragraph in which he summed up ideas he had developed elsewhere (mainly in his The Literal Meaning of Genesis and The Trinity). 39 The Trinity, VII,6,12: «Sunt enim qui ita distinguunt ut Imaginem velint esse Filium, hominem vero non imaginem sed ad imaginem». Augustine might be referring to Ambrose himself who defined man as «the image of the Image» (the Word) (Ambrose, In Ps. 118, 10,6; In Lue. 10:49). See footnote 27, above. " See footnote 12, above.</page><page sequence="16">502 MARIO FARRUGLA ing to the rule of faith. At the time, he was no longer directly concerned with the refutation of Manicheism. And yet, he understood too well that the origine of ali there is constitutes an issue of the utmost importance for the well-being of the Church. While working at an in-depth interpretation of humanity's creation in God's image, the bishop was carrying out his pas toral duties, enlightening the faith of his fellow believers, and helping them mature in their union with God. But how could Augustine account for a major hurdle? How could two accounts exist side by side as they speak of God's creation? Both (a) had to be equally and literally true, and (b) an allegorical interpretation of the two moments could never be enough to justify their objective truth. Augustine believed that the first two chapters of Genesis narrated two different moments - or dimensions - of the one creation. Time and succes sion are themselves creatures and can never constitute the distinction bet ween the two creations: time and succession do exist, inasmuch as they constitute part of a whole. Consequently, Augustine could think of one possible solution. In the first account God called ali things to an initial form of existence that predated time itself. This first moment, he thought, should have straddled eternity (God's being) and time (a hallmark of the current universe). The second story decisively placed creation within time. Gn 2 thus showed how things gradually developed and carne to be what they now are. It also explained how the first humanity was subsequently formed of flesh and blood and, after a short period, rebelled against God, bringing a curse on itself and on the rest of creation. In his first creation (Gn l:l-2:4a), God thus produced only intellectual and spiritual beings while, in the second (Gn 2:4b ff), the creator fashioned the corporal and material dimensions that give its concrete and tangible shape to the pre sent universe. Augustine's neoplatonic philosophy - coupled together with Origen's interpretation of the Hexameron which Augustine had studied41 - has com pletely taken over. In Book IV of his The Li terni Meaning of Genesis, Augustine launched a new theory: the rationes primordiales, or rationes causales. That God crea ted together with time had been Augustine's basic answer to the major Manichean objection: what was God doing before he created? Was he idle? He had dealt extensively with that very issue in the last three books of his Confessions. If one were to consider creation from God's point of view, then the cosmos would be timeless ... and simultaneous. Everything would 41 Origin's platonic reading of the two creation narratives contemplates the creation of spiritual beings that preceded a pre-cosmic fall (Gn 1). Through a second creation, God gave another chance to enfleshed spirits (from Gn 2 onwards) so that, through salvation and com munion with God, they could retrace their steps to their lost heavenly home.</page><page sequence="17">AUGUSTINE AND LUTHER 503 come to be at once since, within God's eternity, there could not be any flow of time. God therefore first created the rationes seminales as «formless and formable material, both spiritual and corporeal, from which would be made whatever had to be made».42 Being sheer potencies, they could ac count for the whole of creation, with ali its needs, even though they stili needed to develop.and mature within time, according to God's providence. Augustine consequently understood the seven days of Gn 1 as the first maturation of these rationes primordiales, a development which took place «in a sequence or order which is the order of knowledge».43 What happened to creation thereafter, Augustine explained it as follows: Steering and guiding by his regulatory action [providence] ali the things [God] made simultaneously, he continues to work without ceasing, simultaneously both resting and working [...]. As for those works of his which he is continuing to work right up till now, and which have to be unrolled as the times them selves unwind, Scripture makes a start at telling the story of them when it says: «But a spring was coming up from the earth. And was watering ali the face of the earth» (Gn 2:6).44 Had Augustine somehow accounted for two successive creations, he stili had to explain why God fashioned humanity at two different times. He knew that revelation could never allow him to take the easy way out by positing dualism. But this was an issue to which he could never find a satis factory solution. Were a dualistic interpretation possible, then Gn 1:26 could easily account for the creation of the human soul (the interior man), while Gn 2:7ff demonstrated how sexually differentiated bodies carne to be.45 The solution Augustine proposed continued to be one and the same: in the first simultaneous creation, God brought everything about (body and soul) insofar as they are rationes causales. In the second creation, 42 TheLiteral MeaningofGenesis, V,5,13; Rotelle 282. InV,17,35, Augustine quoted Wis 11:17: «You who made the world from formless matter» (Rotelle 294). One should bear in mind that Au gustine's unique theory of the rationes primordiales or causales was the third stage of a thirty year old, theological reflection of how to account for the sheer fact of two creation narratives. 43 Ibid., IY34,53-35,56; Rotelle 273-5. 44 Ibid.,V,23,46; Rotelle 300. 45 In The Trinity, Augustine was less circumspect and clearly identified the image with the rational soul in man: «That image of the Creator, that has been implanted immortally in its own immortality, must be found in the soul of man, that is in the reasonable or intellectual soul» (ΧΙ\ζ4,6; cf IX,12,17). As he was no longer commenting a biblical text but explaining his theological standpoint, Augustine could permit himself a greater freedom of expression. In IX, 12,18, though, he referred to the three powers of the soul (mens, notitia, amor) as «a certain image of the Trinity» (quaedam imago Trinitatis). In XI,5,8, Augustine underscored the fact the man is created in God's image not in his sensible and corporeal dimensione but in the soul which is superior; the former may stili bear some likeness to God, as the Creator has «made ali things exceeding good [Deus fecit omnia bona valde)».</page><page sequence="18">504 MARIO FARRUGIA those same primordial causes could be «realised visibly».46 Things, he as serted, needed to be «"unwrapped from their wrappings" in the course of subsequent ages», even though they were «completely fìnished then in a certain way» right from the very beginning, when God simultaneously cre ated the world.47 When God created humanity in his image and likeness, God made it one and complete. This is ali the more true, because Augustine's Latin text read Gn l:27b as follows: God «made him male and female». Later on, in the second account, God induced man to sleep and fashioned the woman out of his side (Gn 2:21-22).48 Consequendy, Genesis' understanding of the image applies to God's first, simultaneous creation of humanity as one single entity. Subsequently, it developed further as a spiritual being on the sixth day, and likeness carne to be. God's image stands for an intellectual human nature, inasmuch as it tends toward perfection. Rational humanity made in God's image justifies both Augustine's psychological triads and his understanding of conversion. Humanity can renew and reshape itself according to the light it receives from God and consequendy move toward a fuller union of love.49 Created in God's image, it has the capacity to recognise God's Word and welcome 46 The Literal Meaning ofGenesis, 111,22,34 and VI,7,12; Rotelle 237-8 and 307-8. Augustine squarely jotted down the following rhetorical question: how could God create «him male and iemale», unless it was done with respect to the body1. In VII,24,35, Augustine could at least con cede what follows: «You see, we can only, correctly understand the words to his image with re ference to the soul, and the words male and female (Gn 1:27) as having reference to the body»; Rotelle 341. This does not in any way mean that he was putting into question his theory of the rationes causales. 47 ftid., VI,11,18; Rotelle 311-2. 48 Augustine held on to his theory of the rationes causales, and was quite adamant in combating misinterpretations. In no way could God have created some kind of a hermaphro dite, even though God later took the woman out of the man's side llatus): The Trinity, XII,6,8. See footnote 46, above. 49 «Where, then, is the Trinity? Let us concentrate as much as we can, and cali upon the everlasting light to enlighten our darkness, so that we may see the image of God in ourselves, insofar as we are permitted» («Ubi ergo trinitas? Attendamus quantum possumus, et invoce mus lucem sempiternam, ut illuminet tenebras nostras, et videamus in nobis quantum sinimur, imaginem Dei»] (The Trinity, IX,2,2). At the end, man will see God face to face and be like Christ; the image will then be transformed from glory to glory, an the likeness will reach its perfection (ibid., XIV, 17,23 and 18,24). Dilectio, or the exchange of the highest form of love bet ween the triune God and the human person addresses to God, has been the object of a num ber of studies: see, for example, L. Ayres, «Augustine on God as Love and Love as God» in Pro Ecclesia 5 (1996) 470-487; R. Cannino, The Unity of Love for God and Neighbour in St. Augustine, Louvain, 1993; K.

In The Tri nity, Augustine explained Christ's work of redemption as his becoming man «to re-form us to the image of God».50 Thanks to his acumen, Augustine understood the difficulties inherent to his proposal. He even asked: «What, after ali, are these causai formulae to which God could be said to have made the man in his image, when he had not yet molded his body from mud, not yet made him a soul by puff ing? [...] Or was this formula just dormant in a spiritual creature before the man was set up in his proper nature?»51 In other words, how can the inter preter continue to justify two distinct creations of the one humanity by one and the same God? Augustine's literal interpretation could never question the univocal and factual truth of Holy Scriptum. Though he contemplated two complete literary units, he could not understand both creation accounts as some sort of sapiential literature, more intent on explaining God as the one ori gin of ali rather than on describing how things carne to be.52 Augustine the interpreter also knew too well that, no matter how much he tried, he could never measure up to God's Word (as encountered in Scriptum) or even grasp it fully. In ali humility, he knew too well that he could not have said the last word on the topic. He even envisaged the possibility that some other exegete could come up with a better and more plausible interpretation than his: I myself may quite possibly come to a different interpretation that corres ponds even better with the words of the holy scriptures. I am certainly not in sisting on this one in such a way as to contend that nothing else preferable can be found. [...] But if there is a better way in which this can ali be under stood, not only shall I make no objection, I shall also be positively in its favour.53 50 The Trinity, IV,4,7; cf XI,1,1. 51 The Literal Meaning ofGenesis, VII,22,32-33; Rotelle 339-40. 52 Augustine did consider the days of Gn 1 as some «primordial day» or «working age», that could be quite a different unit from our own conception of time (On Genesis: A Refutation of the Manichees, 1,23,35; Rotelle 62). The emphasis should thus be placed on the complete ness of God's creative action, rather than on the sheer passage of time: «It is without any stretch of time being involved that God makes things». Augustine knew well that God lies be yond time (Unfinished Literary Commentary on Genesis, 7, 28; Rotelle 130-1). In The Literal Meaning ofGenesis, IV,27,44, Augustine wrote: «Now clearly, in this earth-bound condition of ours we mortals can have no experiential perception of that day»; in V,2,4, he spoke of a «spe cial» or a «spiritual» day, certainly something quite different from «the one we are familiar with here» (Rotelle 267 and 278). 53 The Literal Meaning ofGenesis, Ι\ζ28,45 and VII,28,42; Rotelle 268 and 344.

He did not expect to pro pose some new doctrine or some marvel of human scholarship; he just wanted to exhort and admonish Christiane, learned or otherwise. Genesis itself demanded such a course of action, Luther claimed, because it was the first and a very well known hook in the whole Church.54 His In Genesin Declamationes had to pursue that same intent. On the contrary, as Luther began his Lectures on Genesis in 1535, he dedicated his introduction to the clarification of the approach that he wanted to pursue: «The first chapter [Gn 1] is written in the simplest lan guage; yet it contains matters of the utmost importance and very difficult to understand».55 He was aware of the fact that many commentators and biblical scholars had raised diverse questions and suggested innumerable points; at the end, though, believers could only find themselves lost in ut ter confusion. The faithful had only two clear points to hold onto: (a) that the world has a beginning, and (b) that God has created out of nothing. Luther decided for a literal interpretation of the Bible, and went about it with more decision than Augustine himself ever did: «We assert that Moses spoke in the literal sense, not allegorically or figuratively, i.e., that the world, with ali its creatures, was created within six days, as the words read».56 While Augustine did comprehend the six days as a form of some primordial time, Luther stuck to the literal chronology of the world, the time-frame that scientists today would associate with a 'Young-Earth' theo ry. He explicitly criticised Augustine's interpretation of the Hexameron as an instantaneous creation that took place in some kind of mystical time; he should have been referring to Augustine's theory of the rationes 54 «non ut novum aliquod doctrinae aut ruditionis miraculum ederem, cum sit is liber in tota ecclesia Christi notissimus ac vere primus» (WA 24,1,6-8). 55LWI, Lectureson Genesis, Chapters 1-5, (1958): 3; WA 42,3,15-16. 56 LW 1,5; WA 42,5,15-17. Later on, commenting on the second day of creation, Luther could contemplate Moses' eventual forgetfulness, but never a mistake of Moses' part: «Here Moses seems to be forgetting himself, because he does not deal at ali with two very important matters, namely, the creation and the fall of the angels, and relates only the state of affaire of physical things, although there is no doubt that the angels were created». Luther went the whole length of justifying the 'author' of the Pentateuch: «Because Moses was writing for a people without learning or experience, he wanted to write what was necessary and useful to know» (LW 1,22; WA 42,17,36-38 and 18,25-26).</page><page sequence="21">AUGUSTINE AND LUTHER 507 causales. The theologian, Luther believed, could only exhort an audience to place its trust solely in Moses' authority: We know from Moses that the world was not in existence before 6,000 years ago. Of this it is altogether impossible to convince a philosopher, because, ac cording to Aristotle, no first man or last man can be conceded. [...] For what need is there of setting up a twofold knowledge? Nor does it serve any useful purpose to make Moses at the outset so mystical and allegorical. His purpose is to teach us, not about allegorical creatures and an allegorical world but about real creatures and a visible world apprehended by the senses. Therefore, as the proverb has it, he calls «a spade a spade,» i.e., he employs the terms «day» and «evening» without allegory, just as we customarily do.57 Here, Luther summarily articulated a number of principles. The first methodological one expressed a preference of literal interpretation to alle gorical reading.58 In Luther's opinion, the four approaches to Scripture that medieval theology proposed in its biblical hermeneutics could be con densed to two: the literal and the allegorical.59 The latter would have in cluded the moral (or tropological) and the eschatological (or anagogical). A lot has been said, as to whether Luther consistently espoused the use of Scripture with little regard to tradition, or even whether - in biblical hermeneutics - the mature Luther did recommend a limited recourse to tradition. The fact that he felt the need to refute Aristotle (and Aquinas) and gave a circumscribed assent to the writings of Hilary of Poitiers and Augustine, and to the medieval commentaries of Nicholas of Lyra: ali that would sustain and corroborate the mature Luther's interest in the cen turies-old tradition of the Church.60 57 LWI, 3 and 5; WA 42,3,30-32 and 4,42-5,9. Speaking of Aristode, Luther could be refer ring to the many quotations from Aristotie that Thomas Aquinas carried in his S.Th.q. 46, a. 1. Luther's understanding of Thomas depended on the various references and quotations that G. Biel and other late scholastics had made in the lectures Luther himself had attended. 58 Ralph W. Doermann believes that Luther's adoption of a literal interpretation wanted to counter 'spiritualists'. Doermann adds: «Rules for interpretation are set forth in one place and seemingly ignored in another, without any apology at ali. It often seems that Luther uses more of an intuitive approach than any set exegetical method» (Id., «Luther's principles of biblical interpre tation» in F.W. Meuser-S.D. Schneider [edd.], Interpreting Luther's Legacy, Minneapolis, 1969,15). 59 In his accounts of Luther's early development (1513-1515), J. Wicks contrasts Luther's will ingness to read the Psalms according to their fourfold meaning so as to work towards the doctrinal and spiritual enrichment of his audience. Luther's passion for the literary sense carne to the fore between 1518 and 1520, especially within the context of theological disputes; within the speciflc genre of disputation, only the literary interpretation of a Scriptural text can enjoy probative value. J. Wicks, Manyearningforgrace. Luther's early spiritual teaching Washington, 1968,41-95. 60 LW I, 69. The young doctor of theology had referred to Lyra as «a literalist and a rabbi». As the mature Luther studied Hebrew and Greek, he appreciated Nicholas ali the more. See R.W. Doermann, «Luther's principles of biblical interpretation», 16. In his Lectures on Genesis, Luther referred quite often to Lyra. Nicholas of Lyra (1270-1349) - a French Franciscan who taught at the Sorbonne - was the author of the first printed commentary on the Bible.</page><page sequence="22">508 MARIO FARRUGIA Whatever Luther's position could have been, he did certainly bank on the following axiom: «Only Scripture can explain itself, insofar as it is the written Word of God».61 In actual fact, when Luther invited his readers to discard Augustine's allegorical interpretation, he continued as follows: «If we do not comprehend the reason for this, let us remain pupils and leave the job of teacher to the Holy Spirit».62 The method Luther often resorted to in his exegesis, was that of plac ing side by side a number of texts, so that one text would illumine and ex plain the other. Some Fathers of the Church had recommended the method of having a more widely used text, or one that was better known, to illustrate another, more difficult pericope: «The holy Fathers explained Scripture by taking the clear, lucid passages and with them shed light on obscure and doubtful passages».63 What Luther was hinting at was the chance of understanding a text in a wider context which is God's revelation of himself as the Lord and Saviour of fallen humanity. At the same time, his exegesis depended on, and was subservient to, the profession of faith as found in the Creeds of the Church. Any other method could at best - Luther insisted - be considered an optional. He referred to Nicholas of Lyra's subdivision of the Hexameron in three successive stages. The first stage was timeless: it was when the Cre ator himself was at work; it could not ever have taken place within time (the opus creatoris). At a later stage, during the first three days of the Hexa meron (Gn I), God separated ali that he had already created. He then dedi cated the last three days to adorn ali that he had already created and sepa rated. Luther though raised a further objection, but then invited his read ers to make up their own minds about Lyra's hermeneutic: «I do not know whether this tallies well with the facts in every case. Yet if anybody finds pleasure in that sort of thing, let him consult Lyra».64 61 «Scriptura sui ipsius interpres» (WA 7,97,23). Luther elsewhere added: «In this manner, Scripture is its own light. It is a fine thing when Scripture explains itself»; J.G. Walch (ed.), D. Martìri Luthers, Sàmtliche Schriften, St. Louis, 1881-1910, 11:2335, as quoted by A.S.

Cf also Origen, De Principiis, IV; Augustine, De Doctrina, I-III; Jerome, Ad Paulum Ep. liii, 6. 7. Luther also felt the need to advocate discretion in the use one could make of the Fathers of the Church: «They often speak as the result of an emotion and of a particular mood which we do not have and cannot have, since we do not have similar situa tions. And so the inexperienced appropriate everything without discrimination, in the sense they give to it and not in the one the Fathers had» (LW 1,61; WA 42,45,42-46,3). 64 LW 1,5; WA 42,5,24-25.</page><page sequence="23">AUGUSTINE AND LUTHER 509 James A. Nestingen succinctly drew up the strengths and weaknesses of the Reformer's task: «For preachers, Luther's approach to Genesis is at its greatest strength just where current biblical criticism is at its weakest - in ferreting out the way the text addresses the hearer. Here Luther's use of the text shows the way biblical narrative has functioned in the past and should once again, as the church seeks to recover its story».65 The God of Jesus Christ When, in his In Genesin Declamationes, Luther started to comment on humanity's creation in God's image, he immediately took stock of the many interpretations that reproposed Augustine's reading of the plural «Let us make [...]» (Gn 1:26) and referred it directly to the Trinity. These authors launched themselves into long excursi through which they expounded the triadic con stitution of the human being. Luther decided, he dici not want to do anything of that kind. He just wanted to follow Paul's clear understanding (a) that post lapsarian humanity is an 'earthly' creation (ICor 15:48f), (b) that the first hu manity had been created by God in justice and in holiness (Eph 4:22-24),66 and (c) that the renewed humanity will one day be once again the image God had intended it to be at the very beginning (Col 3:3-4).67 Adam, Luther believed, was the first person to be created both in the image of God and in the image of Christ. Adam's fife before the fall was illumi nated by human wisdom (sapientia humana) and by an exquisite union with God (exquisita religio). Luther's insistence on humanity as created in the image of the Christ allowed him to establish, right from the very moment of creation, straightforward links with the sacrifice of the cross and with redemption. Had he said that humanity was made in the image of the Word, such a dose connection between the earthly paradise and the sacrifice of the cross would have been harder to sustain. The German version of the text underscores a doublé choice that is present in history from its very beginning. Luther portrays on the one hand Christ, the perfect image of God, and on the other Adam who was shortly to become a terrible and horrifying creature.68 65 J. A. Nestingen, «Luther in Front of the Text: The Genesis Commentary» in Word and World 19 (1994) 2,192. 66 Incidentally enough, in its Decree on Originai Sin (1546), the Council of Trent chose the same Pauline phrase to explain, as much as possible, what human kind lost through the fall of the first humanity (DH 1511). 67 Luther's In Genesin Declamationes consists of a doublé text: Latin and German. These are two different texts, so that the German version does not carry the third reference to Col 3:3-4 (WA 24,50,2-4). 68 The Latin version of In Genesin Declamationes is generally sedate and to the point; the German, on the contrary is more profuse, vivid, and engaging. Analysing the differences bet ween the two versions of the one commentary could be quite intriguing: Luther certainly ne ver wanted to have just a German translation of a Latin originai.</page><page sequence="24">510 MARIO FARRUGIA In his Lectures on Genesis, Luther read the plural of «Let us make» (Gn 1:26) as follows: «God summons Himself to a council and announces some sort of deliberation».69 This set Luther free from any trinitarian interpreta tion of humanity's origins. He did dwell on God's special pian and provi dence, as something that greatly distinguishes the fashioning of humanity from the rest of creation. Once God's deliberation truly singled out huma nity as his image, the latter should be the main characteristic that distin guishes humanity and sets it apart from the rest of creation. If Luther interpreted God's deliberation as a special honour reserved for his last creation, he also took the decisive step of an eschatological in terpretation of that same text. God's pian continues far beyond the initial moment of creation: it already envisaged a better future for those humans that God was creating. Luther then added that, to those who are «spiritual ly minded», Moses explained how «we were created for a better life in the fhture than this physical life would have been, even if our nature had re mained unimpaired».70 He referred to Peter Lombard to further sustain his claim that his own eschatological vision did not depend simply on the fall that was to follow, as much as it stemmed from God's own pian and provi dence.71 Had the fall never occurred then, when time would have come to an end, God would have transferred the saints that composed humankind to an eternai and spiritual form of existence. The reference to Paul's theology of the saints, and to their future glory, is quite evident. It does also runs parallel to Luther's interpretation of the Second Person at creation as the Christ. The Church - part of God's pian and providence in the current economy - must have formed an important part of God's originai pian. Luther could thus envisage, righi from the mo ment of creation, humanity's goal as a communion of saints. Physical life, as God originally intended it to be, would have consisted in a transition to ward a spiritual union with God; bodily activities such as eating and pro creation would have been more limited in time and energy. Luther's eschatological considerations amounted to a re-interpreta tion of Gn 1:26. If heaven stood for a complete, spiritual union with God and brought life on earth to an end, then faith in an otherworldly existence as God had devised and ordained it should have stemmed from the confi dence with which believers would have gone through life. Even in the case 69 LW 1,56; WA 42,42,3-4. This, though, is not to be taken as a «plural of deliberation» the way modem exegesis understands it; for Luther later added: «It is utterly ridiculous when the Jews say that God is following the custom of princes, who, to indicate respect, speak of them selves in the plural number» (LW 1,58; WA 42,43,35-37). 70 «Mose igitur spiritualibus significat nos ad excellentiorem vitam esse conditos, quam haec corporalis esse futura in natura etiam integra» (LW 1,56; WA 42,42,21-22). 71 Cf. Peter Lombard, Sententiarum libri quatuor, Π, Dist. XX, in PL 192:692B694.</page><page sequence="25">AUGUSTINE AND LUTHER 511 of pre-lapsarian humanity, that would only have been possible through the merits of Christ himself. Luther's soteriological hermeneutic identified the creator God as the Father of Jesus Christ and underscored the fact that, without Christ's mis sion on earth, human existence could never have attained what God's pian and providence had set in store for it.72 While Luther was ready to ascribe to the originai humanity a confidence in its capacity to achieve full union with God, he also clearly dwelt on the need of the future merits stili to be obtained in Christ. In this way, he could underline the fact that heaven and full communion with God, even in a condition free from sin, are always God's own gift to human kind. Luther's clear intent was that of presenting his readers with a pre-lap sarian creation that could be understood in terms of a post-lapsarian vi sion of human existence. His interpretation reached its climax at the men tion of Christ's merits. A number of questione begin to cross the mind of those who study Luther's writings. Could Luther have merely been applying his biblical hermeneutics to pre-lapsarian humanity? Could he have simply been try ing to explain something more difficult by means of something that his readers and his hearers could grasp with greater ease? Was he mentioning Christ's merits, because sinful humanity in its present condition cannot doing anything except through Christ? Or could Luther have been implying some sort of previsa merita, through which even pre-lapsarian humanity would have come to God solely through Christ? The least one can say is the following: Luther's adoption of the mes sianic title, «Christ», at the moment of creation demands a God who did ai ready create humanity in the light of the future incarnation of his Son and the Son's mission here on earth. Without a doubt, just as at that time God rejoiced in the counsel and work by which man was created, so today, too, He takes pleasure in restoring this work of His through His Son and our Deliverer, Christ. It is useful to ponder these facts, namely, that God is most kindly inclined toward us and takes delight in His thought and pian of restoring ali who have believed in Christ to spiritual life through the resurrection of the dead.73 72 «Die Exegese Luthers zum Bild Gottes im Menschen deutet darauf, dass Luther von der Soteriologie her argumentiert» (A.E. Buchrucker, «Luthers Anthropologie nach der grossen Genesisvorlesung von 1535/45» in Neue Zeitschrift fìir systematische Theologie und Religions philosophie 14 [1972] 2,255; cf. ibid., 256). 73 «Sine dubio autem, sicut tum Deus oblectatus est in isto Consilio et opere hominis creati, ita hodie quoque delectatur in restituendo hoc suo opere per Filium suum et nostrum liberatorem Christum. Haec utile est cogitare, quod scilicet Deus optima de nobis cogitai et delectatur in ista cogitatione et Consilio suo de restitutione in spiritualem vitam per resurrec tionem mortuorum, qui crediderunt in Christum» (LW 1,68; WA 42,51,27-32).</page><page sequence="26">512 MARIO FARRUG1A Notwithstanding ali the above, it was to the Holy Spirit that Luther ascribed the gift of human dignity: humanity's glory sets it apart from the rest of creation. Consequently, Luther had to conclude that in Christian eyes the «Let us make» of Gn 1:26 should evoke faith in the Holy Trinity, in spite of Jewish exe gesis according to which God should have then been addressing the angelic hosts. The authorities Luther cited were William of Ockham and Nicholas of Lyra who, in turn, referred back to a «Rabbi Ibn Ezra». Reading Gn 1:26 without any direct reference to the Trinity, the «mystery of our faith», would amount to adopting what Luther would have considered a false hermeneutic: God cannot ever be comprehended as one, as the Jewish faith would have it.74 When Luther placed side by side the «Let us make» of Gn 1:26 and the «He made» of Gn 1:27, he stili had to justify the diverse use of the plural and the singular. He thus explained how Moses «clearly and forcibly» want ed to show that God acted ad extra as one Godhead and Creating Essence, even though ad intra «there is one inseparable and eternai plurality».75 Gn 1:26 would thus refer back to the Trinity ad intra, while Gn 1:27 illustrated the Trinity as one, in relation to its human creation. Consequently, this is a sure indication of the Trinity, that in one divine essence there are three Persone: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Not even so far as Their activity is concerned, therefore, is God separated, because ali three Persons here co-operate and say: «Let Us make». The Father does not make one man and the Son another, nor the Son one man and the Holy Spirit an other; but the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, one and the same God, is the Author and Creator of the same work.76 Luther again justified ali the above in the light of the future revelation in Jesus Christ. If the reference to the Trinity in Gn 1:26, at the time it was written, would have hardly been intelligible, that was so «because ali things were reserved for that future Lord for whose arrivai was reserved the resti tution of ali things (Acts 3:21), of ali knowledge, and of ali revelations». What the Scriptures convey in «enigmas, as it were», Christ would later clarify and the command his own disciples to proclaim and preach it in plain language. «When Christ carne, those seals had to be broken; and what had been communicated in dark words previously, solely out of res pect for the future Teacher, had to be preached plainly».77 74 LW 1,57-58; WA 42,43,12-14. Luther also refuted another Jewish theological contention, attributed to Rabbis Shmuel Ben Meir (born in France in 1084 and died 1174) and Avraham Ibn Ezra (born in Toledo in 1089, he died in Calahorra in 1167), that God created humanity in the image of angels (D'Ttk). Both Rabbis contributed their commentaries to the Talmud. 75 LW 1,58; WA 42,43,26-27. 76 LW 1,58; WA 42,43,38-44, 7. 77 LW 1,59; WA 42,44,24-26. While Luther had been vehemently advocating a literal inter pretation of a biblical text, he now clearly suggested an allegorica! interpretation as only in Christ can the full meaning and content of a revelation be fully explained and made manifest.</page><page sequence="27">AUGUSTINE AND LUTHER 513 If Luther saw in the creator the God of Jesus Christ, he did so to ex plain (a) the goal for which humanity was being created, (b) the fullness of revelation in which humanity would one day understand ali the words of God, (c) the redemption of the fallen humanity that would restore human kind to a greater dignity, and (d) the ultimate fulfilment that constituted humanity's ultimate happiness.78 The 'restored' image In his 1527 commentary, Luther's major contention was that the hu man dignity understood in terms of God's image can only be an object of faith.79 Nonbelievers, he added, cannot ever acknowledge human dignity as such, for it is a theological reality beyond their understanding. In the Ger man version, Luther explained how God made man an image, made ac cording to the measure of humanity itself.80 To understand the human image, the point of reference would not be God as much as humanity itself. This fact will take the contemporary scholar by surprise, but Luther justified his interpretation as follows. The human person - both body and soul - has a doublé choice: to be an image either of God or of the devil. Consequently, the likeness - the end result of such an option - would thus depend on each individual's choice. The 'ei ther / or' is put in very clear terms: either wisdom, virtue and love, friend ship and service, or evil lust. Good persone choose to do good thanks to the spontaneity of their union with Christ the Saviour; it simply 'occurs', al most without any deliberation. Luther though referred to those persone, who deliberate and choose whether they should take some good course of action or not, as individuale who lack piety (impii); tnrough their indeci sion, they would already be moving in the direction of sin.81 When Adam sinned, the 'fruit' of being created in God's image was stili there; what later was lost, was Adam's existence as the very image of God himself. Adam had chosen to be the living image of Satan. What Luther meant by the 'fruit' of God's creating act, lies at the root of human exis tence: whatever happens, humankind always exists as created by God, and 78 The above pages have shown how Luther read Genesis in the light of the regula fidei and how the Creed set the stage for his hermeneutic. When one considers how Luther thus carne to these four conclusions, one cannot refrain front asking whether the medieval four senses of Scripture could also have been at play. It is quite intriguing how these four conclu sions run parallel to the literal, the allegorical (or christological), the moral (or tropological), the eschatological (or anagogical) rereading of Gn 1:26-27. 79 WA 24,49,2-4: «Et hoc omnium maxime observandum est, est enim initium diginitatis hominis, quae hic magna describitur, sed non nisi videtur». 80 «ein bilde, das uns enhlich und gleich ist» (WA 24,51,11-12). 81 «Non sic impii qui meditantur, quomodo se sanctos faciant, deliberant primum, an quid facturi sint, an non» (WA 24,52,2-4).</page><page sequence="28">514 MARIO FARRUGIA only in God lies its foundation and its origin. Luther used a very challeng ing turn of phrase: «It is not within human power to be either a man or a woman; but it is better that it be such, as it has been made by God».82 The upshot of ali the above is that Luther did not consider the image as constitutive of the human person. Being an image isl But each one needs to decide what form one wants to give to one's own image. In his Lectures on Genesis, Luther explained how God created Adam and accorded him the gift of a doublé life: one «physical» and another «im mortai». Notwithstanding the physical, humanity was stili made in the im age and likeness of God, for it could reach out toward a kind of life Adam had received from God «only in hope». Perhaps Abraham served as model for Luther's conception of Adam before the fall. The Patriarch lived ali his life hoping in God's promises, so that Paul praised and extolled him as a model for ali believers (Rom 4:18). Adam's life should have consisted in sustaining the hope of a future life and directing himself and his progeny toward the goal God had barely, though clearly, revealed. And revelation does imply the knowledge of some reality that cannot be immediately ac cessible. Consequently, Adam himself should have welcomed God's mani festation of a future glory and should have acted accordingly. This though was not to be. Just as Luther had done in his In Genesin Declamationes, he again indicated human lust as the catalyst that radically changed the human condition. Rather than allowing the concrete activities of physical life to lead Adam toward union with God, lust eventually redi meteci the first human towards the total loss of what God's pian and provi dence had originally intended. When, through the fall, Adam lost his being created in God's image, he also lost sight both of the eschatological and the communitarian goal God had originally revealed. Its post-lapsarian condi tion changed human existence into utter disorientation and into an unsa tiable want of true fulfilment. While Luther understood the image as something the first humanity had received as gift from God, together with the gift of life, he interpreted the image as 'relational' rather than some objective characteristic. Conse quently, the image could potentially do one of two things: either grow in accordance with God's grace, or else be lost as a direct consequence of sin. 82 «Non est in potestati hominis virum ese aut mulierem, sed ut a Deo conditus est, sic esse oportet» (WA 24,52,8-53,1). For Luther, one needs to accept one's being a man or a woman, because the Creator himself wills it to be so. The use of the deponent verb condidor, condidi, conditus sum rather that the passive form of creare cannot simply be a casual choice: it indicates that humanity's roots always lie in God. That is why Luther could write: «Fructus mansit, imago Dei non mansit» ilbid). In the Latin version, Luther explained that, had mankind not sinned against God, then women would bear children without the need of recur ring to the pleasures of the flesh.</page><page sequence="29">AUGUSTINE AND LUTHER 515 My understanding of the image of God is this: that Adam had it in his being and that he not only knew God and believed that He was good, but that he al so lived in a life that was wholly godly; that is, he was without the fear of death or of any other danger, and was content with God's favor.83 But when Luther explained what the human image consisted of, he referred his readers back to Augustine's The Trinity (IX-XI). He stili tried to maintain a certain distance from Augustine's theology and the hurdle was again one of a hermeneutic nature. Could Aristotle, a mere philosopher, move into biblical hermeneutics and explain some biblical concept? Luther believed that in The TrinityX, 11,17-18, Augustine had wholeheart edly absorbed Aristotle's idea of the three powers of the soul: memory, in tellect, and will.8,1 He thus thought that in order to explain «the image of God which is in ali» Augustine reverted to philosophical categories that were alien to the biblical text.85 And this could not be right, by Luther's own hermeneutics. The major difficulty though lay in the very fact that, for Luther, image and likeness were synonyms that stood for the one creation of God. Like ness was the easier concept, one that clarified and explained what image stood for. Western patristic tradition - starting with Irenaeus himself - had considered likeness to be the weaker concept among the two; the Fathers believed that likeness could be lost through sin without impairing God's image in the human person. Their basic contention was that image meant what God created humanity to be, while likeness was what God had in tended humanity to become.86 Luther insisted: 83 LW 1,62-63; WA 42,47,8-11. A.E. Buchrucker thinks that the major difference between the two major Western Churches - the Catholic and the Evangelical - lies in their understanding of the image. The Former sees it as a reladonal dimension that belongs to human nature: it constitutes the common ground for the encounter between God and the human person. The Latter looks at the image as a supernatural gift of God that exemplifies that fundamental relatìonality (cf. A.E. Buchrucker, «Luthers Anthropologie nach der grossen Genesisvorlesung von 1535/45», 253-254). 84 Luther even contemplated the rhetorical question whether Satan was somebody crea ted in God's image, since Satan stili possessed memory, intellect and will. «If these powers are the image of God, it will also follow that Satan was created according to the image of God, since he surely has these naturai endowments, such as memory and a very superior intellect and a most determined will, to a far higher degree than we have them» (LW 1,61; WA 42,46,7-10). 85 «Just as in the divine relationships, they say, the Word is begotten from the substance of the Father and the Holy Spirit is the delight of die Father, so, in the case of man, from the memory comes forth the word of the heart, which is the mind». The very fact that Luther twice added «they say» ensured that his readers would understand that he could not be in full agree ment with such an interpretatìon. Later, he continued: «Although I do not condemn or flnd fault with that effort [that of Augustine and others] and those thoughts by which everything is brought into relationship with the Trinity, I am not at ali sure that they are very useful, espe cially when they are subsequentiy spun out further» (LW 1,60-61; WA 42,45,7-9.24-26). 86 Cf Irenaeus, Centra Haereses, V,6,l: «The man is rendered spiritual and perfect because of the outpouring of the Spirit, and this is he who was made in the image and likeness of God.</page><page sequence="30">516 MARIO FARRUGIA When we speak about that image, we are speaking about something un known. Not only have we had no experience of it, but we continually experi ence the opposite; and so we hear nothing except bare words."7 Luther did speak of the image as something that could grow, as well as could he lost through sin. When explaining 'likeness', he correctly under stood it to be a noun in apposition with 'image'. Likeness, he added, should therefore consist in the various gifts of grace that render the image ali the more perfect, but it is the image that makes humanity what God wanted it to be.88 He also quoted the medieval theological axiom that «our nature is perfected through grace».89 If the Creator did provide memory with hope, the intellect with faith, and the will with love, Luther added, humanity should be ali the more aware that the only self-image it possesses has been tainted with sin and depravity. Consequendy, by converting image and likeness into two interchangeable realties, Luther could even refer to the one reality that could be affected by sin as much as by grace. On account of the controversies then raging on the theme of the hu man free will, Luther resisted any temptation of accepting Augustine's statement, «God, who created you without you, will not save you without you».90 He thought that Augustine was proposing here a Dionysian attitude toward God and was calling individuals to bring about their own salvation through the powers of their own human nature. Even identifying the image with some sort of human perceptive power would turn someone into a «leprous and unclean» person.91 But if the Spirit be wanting to the soul, he who is such is indeed of an animai nature, and being left carnai, shall be an imperfect being, possessing indeed the image [of God] in his formation (in plasmate), but not receiving the similitude through the Spirit; and thus is this being imper fect» (A. Roberts - J. Donaldson [edd.], Ante-Nicene Fathers, I, Albany [CD-ROM] - AGES Soft ware, 1997,1063). 87 The poet in Luther then took over: «Who could adequately describe this glory in words? I believe that Adam could command a lion with a single word, just as we give a command to a trained dog. And he was free to cultivate the soil to produce what he wished. Our later discus sione will show that thorns and thistles were not ;n existence at that time. Similarly, I also be lieve that in those days the beasts were not as Aeree as they are now. [...[I hold that before sin the sun was brighter, the water purer, the trees more fruitful, and the Helds more fertile» (LW 1,63-64; WA 42,47,42-48,1 -5.7-8). 88 LW 1,68; WA 42,51,15-25. Cf Peter Lombard, Sententiae, II, dist. XVI. 88 «Sicut enim similitudo est quaedam perfectio imaginis, ita dicunt naturam perRci per gratiam» (LW I, 60; WA 42, 45, 11-12). See Aquinas's various formulations of his axiom: «Gratia non tollit sed perheit naturam» (S. Th. I, q. 1. a. 8 ad 2); «Gratia perficit naturam secundum modum naturae» [S.Th. I, q. 62, a. 5); «Sed contra, gratia perficit naturam. Sed natura procedit ex imperfectioribus ad perfectiora, sicut patet in omni motu et generatione; et similiter etiam ars. Ergo et similiter gratia debuit prius imperfecte et postea copiose per efficaciam sacramen ti dari» (Scriptum super SententiisW, d. II, q. 1, a. 4, qc. 2). 90 Super Ioannem, serm. 169, c. 11; cf Thomas Aquinas, S. Th. Ili, q. 84, aa. 5 and 7. 91 LWI,61-62; WA 42,46,13.</page><page sequence="31">AUGUSTINE AND LUTHER 517 Luther's main argument was that the human image should never be underestimated and considered as if it were some human, naturai trait: it always continues to be God's own gift, something that humanity can never understand or fathom. Augustine's solution though is stili ultimately Luther's: so atrocious and dreadful was humanity's downfall through sin that only the use of the superlative could somehow account for humanity's pre-lapsarian state.92 Man's inner and outer sensations were then 'of the purest kind'; «his intellect was the clearest, his memory was the best, and his will was the most straightforward».93 Luther's hermeneutic of Gn 1:26-27 can be summed up as follows: though commenting explicitly on the fall and its after-effects, Luther was actually elaborating on God's originai creation. He was making use of a text that is more accessible to the present human condition (Gn 3), so as to il lustrate another that is less intelligible (Gn 1). He also read Gn 1:27 as a clear indication that woman too «was made by God as a partaker of the di vine image and of the divine similitude, likewise of the rule over every thing» and as «the partaker of the future life, just as Peter says that they are joint heirs of the same grace (1 Pt 3:7).94 Conclusion «Luther's anthropology is the one of religious experience: it is more than just an anthropology of formai theological reflection».95 The same 92 In The City ofGod, XIV10, Augustine spoke highly of the perfection of the first humanity: «Their love to God was unclouded, and their mutuai affection was that of faithfiil and sincere marriage; and from this love flowed a wonderful delight, because they always enjoyed what was loved. Their avoidance of sin was tranquil; and, so long as it was maintained, no other ili at ali could invade them and bring sorrow». He then portrayed fallen humanity as follows «God in His justice abandoned him to himself, not to live in the absolute independence he affected, but in stead of the liberty he desired, to live dissatisfied with himself in a hard and miserable bondage to him to whom by sinning he had yielded himself, doomed in spite of himself to die in body as he had willingly become dead in spirit, condemned even to eternai death (had not the grace of God delivered him) because he had forsaken eternai fife» ( The City of God, XIV, 15,1). 93 LW 1,62; WA 42,43,19-20. Cf LW 1,66-67; WA 42,48,20-49,16. 94 Luther shared with his culture the view that, though women were the «most beautiful work of God», they were inferior to men and the latter's «glory and prestige» (LW 1,69; WA 42,52, io li. Cf 2Pt 1:4). Luther though made sure, as much as he could, that ali comprehended how men and women have been called to share in the same dominion and aim towards the same glory. 95 «Luthers Anthropologie ist eine Anthropologie geisticher Erfahrung, nicht nur eine An thropologie formaler theologischer Oberlegung» (A.E. Buchrucker, «Luthers Anthropologie nach der grossen Genesisvorlesung von 1535/45», 262). According to O.H. Pesch, Luther's is an «existential» theology, while Aquinas's is more «sapiential» (cf O.H. Pesch, «Existential and sa piential theology: the theological conffontation between Luther and Thomas Aquinas» in J. Wicks [ed.], Catholic scholars dialogue with Luther, Chicago, 1970,61-81).</page><page sequence="32">518 MARIO FARRUGIA statement would definitely hold true of Augustine's retrieval of Gn 1:26-27. Both Augustine and Luther desired to deepen their understanding of God's word, moved by their own life experiences. And both had tried to do in a down-to-earth way, as much as they could. That accounts for the fact that, notwithstanding their differences in nuances and procedures, both opted for a literal analysis of the biblical text. In their retrieval, both had to labour with a limited access to the origi nai Hebrew. Luther could handle some Hebrew later in life, when he com posed his Lectures on Genesis,99 while Augustine had to rely on the Latin translations then available. While the latter somehow had to live with a 'maimed' text, Luther took the right linguistic decision that image and like ness had to be understood as synonyms. He did so to the extent that he abandoned the traditional reading of the text as developed by the Fathers and left posterity with the definition of likeness as applied to the image it self. Image had to be understood in terms of likeness. Such a theological simplification would lead to important consequences, whenever the text of Gn 1:26-27 be used within the context of grace and justifìcation, conver sion and communion. Unlike Augustine, Luther brought together the two creation stories. He no longer had to deal with Augustine's predicament and take into account the facticity of two complete creation stories. If Augustine had kept them separate, Luther merged them into one account. If too literal an under standing of the two narratives led Augustine to come up with his theory of the rationes causales, it incited Luther to simplify as much as he could. The Reformer took the humanity of Gn 1:26-27 as simply Adam and Ève.97 Luther could consequently switch details from one account to the other with ease: Here our opinion is supported: that the six days were truly six naturai days, because here Moses says that Adam and Ève were created on the sixth day. [...] Concerning the order of creation of man he will state in the following chapter that Ève was made sometime after Adam, not like Adam, from a clod of earth, but from his rib, which God took out of the side of Adam as he slept. These are 96 In his Tischreden, Luther has this to say: «Wenn ich jiinger ware, so wollte ich diese Sprache learnen, denn ohne sie kann man die h. Schrift nimmermehr recht verstehen. [...] Darum haben sie recht gesagt: Die Ebraer trink aus der Vornquelle; die Griechen aber aus den Wasserlin, die aus der Quell fliessen; die Lateinischen aber aus der Pfutzen. «Ich ben kein Ebraer nach der Grammatica und Regeln, denn ich lasse mich nirgendan binden, sondern ich gehe irei hindurch. Wenn einer gleich die Gabe der Sprachen hat, und verstehet sie, doch kann er darum night eine in die ander so bald dringen and wol verdolmetschen. Dolmetchen ist eine sonderliche Gnade und Gabe Gottes» (WATR 1,525,15-17.18-24). 97 Luther identifìed the humanity of Gn 1:26 as Adam an Ève (LW 1,66; WA 42,49,20). He added: «Here Moses says that Adam and Ève were created on the sixth day» (LW 1,69; WA 42,52,25-26).</page><page sequence="33">AUGUSTINE AND LUTHER 519 ali works of time, that is, works that require time. They were not performed in one moment; neither were these acts: that God brings to Adam every animai and that there was not found one like him, etc. These are acts requiring time, and they were performed on the sixth day. Here Moses touches on them briefly by anticipation. Later on he will explain them at greater length.98 Augustine, on the contrary, had contemplated the 'image' of Gn 1:26 as a ratio primordialis that would later on become a fully-fledged humanity. The most important fusion of horizons that Luther brought about was the one that strictìy conjoined the creation God made with the Paschal Mystery of Jesus Christ. Having done that, he could easily move from the Creator to the Redeemer, from the gift given, to its loss through sin, and back again. He could merge together the horizon of the Book of Nature with the fullness of revelation in Jesus Christ. He could incorporate proto logy into eschatology, and vice-versa. Ali this must have meant a lot to his hearers, allowing them to see how many things fitted together. But the price paid was lack of clarity on the theological difference between image and likeness, between creation, sin and redemption, between nature and grace, something that Augustine did ali he could to keep distinct. Through Christ, humanity has been reborn to hope in eternai life and the new creature will receive a far greater glory in Christ, though the work of the Holy Spirit.99 Luther directly quoted 1 Cor 15:45: «'The first man Adam became a living being'; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit». Augustine turns it into a riddle: God would have willed to preserve even the first man in that state of salva tion in which he was created [...] . But since he did foreknow that man would make bad use of his free will - that is, that he would sin - God pre arranged his own purpose so that he could do good to man, even in man's doing evil, and so that the good will of the Omnipotent should be nullifìed by the bad will of men, but should nonetheless be fulfìlled.100 Throughout the first two millennia of its history, Christian theology has learned to distinguisi! between the concepts of gift and grace, so that 98 LW 1,69-70; WA 42,53,14-21. Referring to Nicholas of Lyra's commentary, Luther also painstakingly recalled how some had interpreted Gn 1:27 as God creating a hermaphrodite and subsequently dividing that creahon into two creatures. Luther fiercely refuted such a possibility, in the name of the very dignity of women. Nor could he accept the idea that women were maimed men (he referred the idea to Aristotle, perhaps to the latter's De generatione animalium, I, c. 20). 89 Luther could thus indicate that the restored image is greater than the originai, as Christ has given humanity the chance to share into God's eternai life (LW 1,64-65; WA 42,48,17-26). 100 Enchiridion de Fide, Spe et Charitate liber unus, 28,104: «Quapropter etiam primum hominem Deus in ea salute in qua conditus erat custodire voluisset, (...] quia vero eum male usurum libero arbitrio, hoc est peccaturum esse, praesciebat, ad hoc potius praeparavit volun tatem suam ut bene ipse faceret etiam de male faciente, ac sic hominis voluntate mala non evacuaretur sed nihilo minus imperetur omnipotentis bona».</page><page sequence="34">520 MARIO FARRUGIA anything the Creator donates to his creature is a gift, while anything that humanity receives from God in Christ is referred to as grace. This though presupposes a radicai distinction that comes from two diverse economies: the one of separation through sin and the other of communion in love. Such a distinction forces a diverse intentionality even within God, the one origin of both gift and grace. With Augustine, theology understands God's relation with just and sinners as the expression of the one unshakeable love, that might express itself in different way. With Luther, theology also rediscovers the centrality of Christ as the key to the human condition. But if theology does understand gift and grace as synonymous, then Christiani ty needs to rethink itself. Just as theology feels the need to venture beyond the customary and cosy shores of its hermeneutics, the life of faith can move into the deep of God's Mystery, allow itself to contemplate everlast ing love, and be surrounded with the loving presence of God, in Christ, through the Spirit.

In their biblical commentaries Augustine and Luther tried to fathom the au thentic meaning of Gn 1:26-27. In dialogue with the scientific world of their day, they carried out this task ali through their eventful lives as they promoted the recta fides of their ecclesial communities. Interpreting the text in the light of the rule of faith, their efforts were more of an exercise in systematics. The present study at tempts to sketch the vitality and commitment of their undertaking, as it outlines its development. Shunning to the best of his abilities any facile solution, the Bishop of Hippo kept on looking for some more articulate understanding; the Reformer con tinued to treasure tradition just as he critically proposed a christocentric under standing meant to inspire his audience. Benché il concetto 'immagine di Dio' resti sempre alla base dell'antropologia cristiana, la sua travagliata recezione ne segna la complessa articolazione. Nei loro commentari biblici Agostino e Lutero s'impegnarono in modo continuativo e pro lungato nel tempo a precisare l'autentico significato di Gen 1,26-27. Si dedicarono alla sua interpretazione cercando il dialogo con il mondo scientifico del loro tempo e promuovendo il retto credere delle proprie comunità di fedeli. Leggendo il testo biblico alla luce della regula fidei, il loro diventa piuttosto uno sforzo sistematico. Questo studio cerca d'abbozzare la vitalità e l'impegno del loro pensiero, oltre a vo ler tracciare il suo sviluppo. Il vescovo d'Ippona sfuggiva a soluzioni di convenienza e si confrontava ripetutamente con questioni di non facile soluzione, mentre il Riformatore continuava a far tesoro della tradizione teologica pur proponendone una lettura critica, piuttosto cristocentrica e orientata alla predicazione.</page></plain_text>
