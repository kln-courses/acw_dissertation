<plain_text><page sequence="1">Male Masochism and the Colonialist Impulse: Mary Webb's Return of the Native Tess CAROL SIEGEL Although the literary canon has become not only a site of conflict but a passion- ately contested concept and gynocriticsI has won considerable respect for the re- covery of forgotten women's texts, books by previously popular and recently re- discovered women writers continue to go rapidly out of print. If for no other rea- son than their usefulness in providing contextualization, such books should be of interest to theorists of culture and language and to feminist critics of all sorts. Why, then, are these books disappearing almost as soon as they reappear? A line of argument that has been pursued by many feminist critics is that the structure of the academy and the training of English professors exert an often unconscious influence on our judgments so that we apply without question heav- ily biased "received standards of greatness or even goodness."2 In other words, our rational processes are colonized by the dominant discourse. However, our rejection of certain books as inferior and unworthy of serious attention can as easily proceed from unexamined feminist standards. Books that have enjoyed popular success often did so because they offered sensationalism derived from a strong mixture of sex and violence, while avoiding outraging their public by at least overtly upholding the most prevalent contemporary ideology. For obvious reasons, such books are unlikely to be a source of immediate delight to feminist readers, perhaps especially when their authors are women. Yet, though femi- nism and institutionalized misogyny are in unlikely alliance against them, these books often deserve careful attention in context-rather than as part of the project of contextualizing "classics"-because, reilluminated in this way, they shine with a surprising power of their own. Mary Webb's Gone To Earth, the novel I will concentrate on in this essay, is a case in point. Just when the predicament of Hazel Woodus, the heroine of Gone to Earth, seems to allow for no resolution, Webb ends the novel by dropping her into a hole. By what might be considered a sort of poetic justice, Webb, as author, has been in danger of suffering the same treatment from readers for some time now. Despite the seductively beautiful paperback editions of her books published in the late 1970s and early 80s, Webb remains unfamiliar even to most profes- sional readers. The current lack of interest in her work is understandable be- cause Webb's elegiac vision of a pastoral England and often expressed admira- For a full definition and explanation of the gynocritical approach see Elaine Showalter, "Toward a Feminist Poetics" in Women's Writing and Writing About Women, ed.

And those judging by anything akin to formalist standards will rank Hardy much higher; despite all the criticisms that have been made about their form, his novels are decid- edly better composed, if better means more smoothly plotted and linguistically sophisticated. However, all readers do not judge by such standards and ordinarily, we might expect to find numerous appreciations of Webb among the works of the Anglo-American feminist critics who are engaged in the construction of a women's literary canon. But, unfortunately, Webb repeatedly dramatizes masochistic female behavior, while her narrators assert its naturalness.3 Faced with a "minor" novelist whose work might be regarded as supporting the old critical assessment of women writers as conservative and imitative, and, even more troublingly, might seem to substantiate psychology's past claim that women are naturally masochistic, even scholars of women's literary traditions may be inclined to let her drop back into obscurity. Yet it is a pity for Hardy's novels to eclipse Webb's, because hers have their own virtues, among which is the light their revisionary responses to his shed on the ways modernist texts in defense of women connect male masochism and the colonialist impulse. In Black Skin, White Masks, Frantz Fanon warns "those who take it on them- selves to describe colonialism ... that it is utopian to try to ascertain in what ways one kind of inhuman behavior differs from another."4 Writings champi- oning women, from the Victorian period on, have commonly avoided at least this sort of relativism, substituting a metonymy in which all appropriative urges are read as colonialist and the oppressor of individuals as a figure for im- perial power. This metonymy is exemplified in the phrase "white slaves" for prostitutes, which not only asserts woman's lack of autonomy and her enslave- ment to the satisfaction of male desires, but paradoxically, because of the dif- ferentiating qualifier "white," insists upon the lack of significant difference between her condition and that of the black slave. She is only a slave of a dif- ferent color. Also, by introducing the idea that skin color has an important rela- tion to enslavement, the phrase places the analogy historically and geograph- ically. Prostituted woman, as white slave, is not like the conquered person of ancient times. Her condition mirrors that of slaves of African heritage, whose slavery is a reification of the status of their own group in relation to imperial- ist powers. Uncle Tom's Cabin, for example, has as the center of its horror that Simon Legree buys refined, pious Emmeline of the "white, delicate hands" to be his sexual slave.5 Stowe envisions blacks and women as spiritually superior to the brutal patriarchs who use the system of slavery to make possible the satis- faction of lust that the natural purity of their victims would otherwise forbid.6 3 For a discussion of such quasi-pornographic elements of Webb's fiction, see Michtle Barale, Daughters and Lovers: The Life and Works of Mary Webb (Middleton, 1986) 127-28. 4 Frantz Fanon, Black Skin, White Masks, trans.

Virginia Woolf makes a similar series of connections when, in an attempt to illustrate her concept of gender difference, she writes that male instinct "murmurs if it sees a fine woman go by, or even a dog, Ce chien est ' moi." She then remarks, "It is one of the great advantages of being a woman that one can pass even a very fine negress without wishing to make an Englishwoman of her."7 In this passage, not only is male desire represented as equating differ- ences of race, gender, and "even" species, it is also transformative in intent. Woolf imagines male desire as an impulse simultaneously to possess and change its alien object into someone familiar, part of the group that gives identity to the self. The pairing of objectification and appropriation make what at first seems an exogamous urge into a movement towards quasi-incestuous gratifica- tion. And in such a longing to make the other into the wife/mother, there is a hint of masochism, since the angel in the house is always potentially the avenging angel, the angel of death.8 That all the writers who used anticolonial rhetoric to protest the oppression of woman saw such implications in it is unlikely, mainly because colonialist ac- tions were rarely seen as expressions of masochism. Except in texts asserting that self-sacrificing imperialists deliberately took on a "white man's burden" of suffering by submitting to cruel savages, colonialist impulses appear more ob- viously connected to sadism than to masochism. Of course, the guilt of the con- querors is expressed directly in autobiographical texts like George Orwell's "Shooting an Elephant" and "A Hanging" and displaced onto the characters in anti-imperialist fictions, the most famous of which is probably Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. To the extent to which public confessions are always implic- itly tinged with masochism, these writings do link masochism with colonial- ism. However, where the presence of masochism is less overt, it often seems more fully intertwined with the business of colonizing others. For instance, in Rudyard Kipling's fiction, colonial conquest is sometimes represented as inex- tricable from punishment through the feminine. In both "The Man Who Would be King" and "Without Benefit of Clergy," the protagonist devotes himself to an excessive and dangerous courtship of a seemingly slavish alien wife as if compelled by his presence in a defeated land. That each man's triumph over the already subjugated woman brings him down into his own ruin hints at con- fluence of sexual, self-destructive, and imperialist urges. But in all these cases, masochism comes into play only in its broadest sense. It seems to lack the ele- ment of sexual pleasure-in-pain popularly seen as its definitive ingredient. In fact, the first problem one encounters in attempting to elucidate the liter- ary connections made between masochistic impulses and any others is the slip- periness of the term. Masochism is used to refer to attitudes as well as activi- ties; behavior with no overt connection to sex as well as to sexual rituals. Moreover, as a result of the popularization of modern psychological theory, Virginia Woolf, A Room of One's Own (1929; reprint, New York, 1957) 52. 8 See Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar, The Madwoman in the Attic (New Haven, 1979) 26.</page><page sequence="4">134 NOVEL I WINTER 1991 masochism is rarely linguistically differentiated from sadism. The usefulness of distinguishing between the two has been increasingly recognized by literary critics in the last few years.9 Theorists of masochism have separated the terms in the interests of interpretive precision, or of increased understanding of the psychological circumstances of textual production, or of disclosing the uncon- scious of the text. However, in the process of deconstruction attendant upon the separation of masochism from sadism, we might also look at the role a histori- cally specific ideology played in their fusion. The conflation of the two seems to have begun with what Paul Robinson sees as the quintessentially modem negation of distinctions in Havelock Ellis's con- cept of sadomasochism as one of many "erotic symbolisms" for ordinary sexual desires.10 This modernist normalization of sadistic and masochistic desires also implicitly supports, as natural, the sexually charged social hierarchies that were increasingly under attack in the earlier part of this century. While writers like Woolf, whom we might retrospectively term culture critics, in- sisted on both the connection between and the perversity of sexism and imperi- alism, more respected theorists of sexuality were arguing that masochism was actually only the result of a misdirection of the normal aggression associated with maleness.11 The popularization of Freudian psychology completed the process of embedding the two terms within each other so that neither condition could be considered separately. Although, by 1920 (in Beyond the Pleasure Principle), Freud was considering the possibility that "there might be such a thing as primary masochism," and in 1929 (in Civilization and Its Discontents), he rather dubiously acknowledged that masochistic and sadistic instincts could "appear in isolation from each other," the psychoanalytic community (and modem discourse) seem more pro- foundly influenced by his earlier assertion (in the 1915 revision of "The Sexual Aberrations") that the "sadist is always at the same time a masochist."12 Unlike Robert Caserio, whose recent reading of "erotogenic" masochism in Freud and Laplanche rightly questions the general understanding of sadism and masochism as alternating expression of the same perversion, or as forming, as he puts it "an unbreakable monad," I remain unpersuaded that this view goes Gilles Deleuze's Masochism: An Interpretation of Coldness and Cruelty, trans. Jean McNeil (New York, 1971) seems to be the most influential of these texts. Gaylyn Studlar provides what is to date the most extensively developed and applied discussion of masochism as a drive entirely separate from sadism in her study, In the Realm of Pleasure: Von Sternberg, Dietrich, and the Masochistic Aesthetic (Chicago, 1988). 10 Paul Robinson, The Modernization of Sex (New York, 1977) 26. 11 In Civilization and Its Discontents, Freud argues that humans' "instincts" result in their view of "their neighbor" as "someone who tempts them to satisfy their aggressiveness on him, to exploit his capacity for work without compensation, to use him sexually without his consent, to seize his possessions, to humiliate him, to cause him pain, to torture and kill him." Although here such behavior is attributed to generic rather than gendered "man," it should be apparent that culture and society have made it easier (and more acceptable under certain legitimizing conditions such as acting in the interests of the State) for men than for women to gratify these aggressive desires. While Freud deplores such "natural" behavior, he also warns that the restriction of outward directed aggression will turn it inward. Trans. and ed.

The conflation sado- masochism is troubling to me not because it simplifies Freud's extraordinarily convoluted discussion of sadism and masochism but because it avoids extreme qualitative differences in the attitudes toward authority expressed through sadistic and masochistic pleasure, fantasy, and ritual. It is also disturbing be- cause it turns analytic attention toward the mysterious forces in the uncon- scious-the war within the psyche symbolized in the term sadomasochism- and away from the readily discernable ways that specific cultural changes and developments connected to imperialism have demanded the performance of cor- responding rituals of masochism or sadism. Although, in The Forms of Violence, Leo Bersani and Ulysse Dutoit follow Freud in considering sadism "a derived and projected masochism," Bersani ear- lier provided a suggestion of what masochism can mean in relation to imperial- ist ideology with his insight that Freud's lack of consistency in assigning mean- ings to the terms "pain" and "pleasure" in his discussion of masochism may indicate a movement toward regarding sexual excitement as incompatible with "the structured self."14 According to this reading, masochism, in its excessive surrender to sexual excitement, would become a particularly powerful force against the concept of unitary selfhood. One might go even further and say that masochism deconstructs the binary opposition between pain and pleasure and consequently makes hierarchies that depend upon punishment meaningless. It seems worth noting that epistemological problems only arise when Freud tries to account for masochistic pleasure; sadism is easy enough to explain. As Angela Carter has shown in her searching critique of the novels of Sade, a masochistic drama is not simply a sadistic drama in which subjecthood is trans- ferred to the one being tortured; it is (at least potentially) an attack on hierar- chy through the freeing of erotic energies from the dichotomies subject/object, victim/victimizer, and good/evil that structure them in the sadistic drama.,s The reason for my parenthetical qualification will become apparent in the dis- cussion of Tess of the d'Urbervilles that follows. Gilles Deleuze's analysis of Masoch's novels points to a structure in masochistic ritual-rather than the dissolution of structure Carter sees in masochistic pleasure-but a one "animated by a dialectical spirit," so that "[i]t is the victim who speaks through the mouth of his torturer."'6 Through this appropriation of the voice of power, the law is parodied, as punishment is transposed from its auxiliary 13 See Robert L.

What seems to be basically the same view of masochistic pleasure's tendency to dismantle the unified ego is reiterated in Leo Bersani's The Freudian Body (New York, 1986) 38-39. 15 Angela Carter, The Sadeian Woman: And the Ideology of Pornography (New York,1978) 128-132. 16 Deleuze 21.</page><page sequence="6">136 NOVEL I WINTER 1991 function "into a condition that makes possible the forbidden pleasure."17 The absolute identification of pain with pleasure in masochistic discourse makes it the ideal medium for a narrative of the ego's triumph over the ultimate colo- nizer, the superego. But what of the texts, other than Masoch's necessarily definitive products, in which such narratives appear? Edmund Bergler, who has produced an extensive body of work on masochism describing it as the wellspring of all neurosis, sees artistic creation as "anti- masochistic" because of the artist's implicit assertion of freedom from depen- dence on the powerful and punishing mother of infancy.18 Here it seems neces- sary to separate author and text, impulse and representation of impulse. Since we cannot know about intentionality except through the mediation of texts, in- cluding in this case those within psychological discourse, it seems useless to de- scribe an author's aesthetics as masochistic or anti-masochistic based on the sort of therapeutic role his creative activity may (or may not) be meant to per- form. In the keynote address of recent symposium on masochism, Arnold Cooper, despite his intention of following Bergler's model, adopted a more promising approach in focusing on cultural artifacts. Implicit in his conclusion that "all cultures value most those achievements that are fired in pain ... The hero is someone who has suffered" is the idea that what is generally called heroism involves the conscious choice of suffering.19 To this extent all literature can be considered to exist in reference to an intertext which connects masochism with a kind of idealized masculinity. Once again, such masochism does not seem sexual; heroes have rarely been imagined as willing victims of sexual abuse. But it is at the nexus of cultural constructions of masculinity as the urge to conquer/control and as the urge to be erotically controlled that the strange figure of the supermasculine masochist is sexualized. His masochism takes the form of eroticization of sexual frustration. In The Use of Pleasure, Michel Foucault connects this masochistic inclination to specific beliefs about the attitudes appropriate to each sex. It may seem that if masculinity is connected with activity and femininity with passivity, the promiscuous man would be considered especially virile and the celibate, or only moderately sexually active, man effeminate. However, Foucault argues that when the ability to take control, at will, of the sexual, including one's own sex- ual appetites, is seen as an essential indicator of manliness, abandoning oneself 17 Ibid. 78. In what is, in many ways, a ground-breaking and brilliant essay on male masochism, Kaja Silverman rather dismissively terms Bersani's and Deleuze's interpretations of male masochism "utopian" ("Masochism and Male Subjectivity," Camera Obscura 17 [May 1988] 56). Yet she, herself, grounds her discussion in a sort of never-never land by treating culture and psychology as ahistorical absolutes. Although it may be true (especially in the case studies she discusses) that "the masochist only acts out in an exaggerated, anthropomorphic and hence disruptive way the process whereby subjects are spoken" (55), subjects are not always identically spoken by "their" cultures (or the various cultures through which they constitute themselves), which accounts in part for the revisionary quality of authors' responses to precursors. In fact, when Silverman discusses the political aspects of T. E. Lawrence's masochism, in "White Skin, Brown Masks: The Double Mimesis, or With Lawrence in Arabia," she closely examines the role "external images" derived from historical events play in constructing masochistic fantasies and also the "important historical consequences" of the acting out of such fantasies (Differences 1 [Fall 1989] 48-49). 18 Edmund Bergler, Curable and Incurable Neurotics: Problems of "Neurotic" versus "Malignant" Masochism (New York, 1961) 277- 78, 385, emphasis Bergler's. 19 Arnold M.

Nor, when woman stands for sexual uncontrol, need a celibate man miss the pleasure of controlling her. On the contrary, as Foucault notes, if a man believes that controlling his desires is the most masculine of sexual activities, exercising such control can be intensely, erotically pleasurable.21 It can also become the informing principle of a particular type of art that displaces woman as sexual object by leaping from the male sexual desire, the representation of which is the text's ostensible object, over the sex act the nar- rator/protagonist is denied, into creative fulfillment. Perhaps the best known example of this sort of text is "To His Coy Mistress," a "seduction poem" that seems calculated to repulse, through mocking and belligerent insults, the woman at whom it pretends to be aimed, while it allows the poet his solitary ecstasy of creation. The final lines substitute word play for sex play. Images of rape and war simultaneously open the significative power of the "ball" to al- low a vision of a transcendent virility defeating even time itself--and to warn her to close her thighs lest she be torn open. As Francis Barker has convincingly shown, the rhetoric of the poem is saturated with the political and moral ide- ology of its times, which is most apparent in its insistence that "[g]oods are to be got, ultimately, by effort, and pleasures ... must be torn from inhospitable cir- cumstances by struggle and amid conflict."22 In this battle to colonize the woman, male pleasure occurs simultaneously with the destruction of the possi- bility of sexual intercourse; it arises in the midst of the textualizing dismem- berment of the woman's body.23 Although not all artistic treatments of male sexual frustration are such perverse, narcissistic pleasure machines, ecstatic male renunciation of sexual activity is ubiquitous in classic and modern texts. Its very omnipresence in our culture makes it hard to read as a perversion of normal sexual expression. Still, we might avoid the mistake of advice columnists who term the eroticized renunciation of sex "true love." We could consider Webb a victim of the same delusion because her major theme is the progression of heroines from submission to brutes who do not de- serve them to acceptance of the rule of renunciatory Christ-Figures who do. But a very different view of the meaning of male masochism is offered in the only one of Webb's works which does not end with a woman giving herself up to her "rightful" male ruler. From the beginning to the end of Gone to Earth, the heroine devotes herself to the protection of her partly-domesticated pet fox, the only living being she unambiguously loves. She perceives her family, fa- ther, aunt, and amorous cousin, for the most part as distractions from her intense sensual pleasure in nature. And her two serious suitors, the squirely Jack Reddin and the minister, Edward Marston, are hardly more to her. She marries Marston in order to secure a safe home for the fox, which her father threatens 20 Michel Foucault, The Use of Pleasure, vol. 2 of The History of Sexuality, trans.

To rephrase my earlier characterization of its conclusion with all the friendliness I feel towards the novel, Gone to Earth ends with its untamed heroine's death as the only possible escape from the two men fighting to expe- rience pleasurable sexual suffering through control of her body. Although Webb's treatment of Hazel can be read as a dismissal of her importance and even as an advocacy of female quietism through reinscribing the conventional inefficacy of feminist protest in the novel, it might better be understood as an incontrovertible rejection of exterior definition and control.24 In fact, Hazel's death is the hinge on which Gone to Earth swings away from Tess of the d'Urbervilles toward the anticolonialist aesthetic from which Webb's revision- ary responses come. Gerard Genette's term metatextualite probably best describes the primary re- lationship of Webb's novel to Hardy's because, although Gone to Earth never quotes Tess and makes few direct allusions to it, on almost every level of mean- ing Webb's novel provides a critical commentary on Hardy's.25 That Webb saw an interest in sadism and masochism in Hardy's works is suggested paratextu- ally by her dedication to him of Seven for a Secret, the novel in which she deals most explicitly with these topics. That she also saw a connection in Tess of the d'Urbervilles between such sexual impulses and the urge to establish control over "primitive," "virgin" territory is indicated by the way she develops Hardy's sexual themes in her own work. The two novels are quite similar structurally. Like Hardy, Webb places a triangle at the center. The basic actions that create the triangle are almost identical. In each story a "natural," passionate but innocent country girl is first courted and then forced into her first sexual experience by a rural libertine. She finds temporary refuge with an idealistic, philosophical young man who loves her, or at least his image of her as a figure for purity. Because she cannot fit this image, due to the perfidity of the woman-chaser who continues to hound her, she is destroyed. The stories are narrated in chronological order, for the most part, with the heroine's periods of sexual activity or chastity determining the other actions. Often changes in the heroine's sexual condition are marked by changes in setting, as when Tess is brought to Tantridge to lose her virginity and, having lost it, is next seen on the road away from Tantridge, resolved to be chaste; or when Angel Clare's refusal to consummate their marriage puts her on the road once more. In Gone to Earth, Hazel jumps like a yoyo between Undern, the valley home of low Reddin, and the parsonage of high-minded Marston, on God's Little Mountain. Her vertical movements parodically translate Tess's long, agonizing pilgrimages into literal leaps at blessedness and tumbles into sin. The slapstick rapidity of Hazel's moral movement fits the tone the book derives from its abundant transcriptions of Hazel's comically innocent philo- 24 As a context for such a reading see Dale Bauer's discussion of the suicides of the female protagonists of The House of Mirth, The Blithedale Romance, and The Awakening in Feminist Dialogics (Albany, New York, 1988) 4, 23, 30-1, 126-27, 154.

As a natural skeptic unfamiliar with Christian doctrines or Edwardian mores, Hazel clownishly reminds the reader of morality's connec- tion to place with her absolute inability to recognize that, wherever she is, each of her two lovers expects her to live according to the rules of his social cir- cle. Her moral mobility is the visible sign of the moral slippage unsettling the power of both of the novels to name love. Both novels occupy a liminal position between the most characteristic tex- tual attitudes toward sex of the Victorian and High Modem periods. Victorian texts tend to concern themselves with a taxonomy of love, manufacturing evi- dence to illustrate the dire consequences of purely sexual love. There is very lit- tle difference in the wages of lust in texts otherwise as dissimilar as Adam Bede, Vanity Fair, Wuthering Heights, and David Copperfield. In contrast, texts otherwise as diverse as Mrs. Dalloway, Ulysses, The Awakening, and Sons and Lovers present, as valuable in themselves, moments when one person recipro- cates another's purely sexual desire in kind. Reciprocal lust does not make an aperture in the fabric of wholesomeness through which evil enters the world, but instead provides a little secret breathing space for bodies oppressed by the almost unbearable overlay of social reading of their desires. In Tess of the d'Urbervilles and Gone to Earth, lust in action forces the participants into a waste of shame too dreary to be Shakespearean. But both novels seem to yearn wistfully for a world in which a good man could act on his lust without moral confusion. "Bad" love remains safe in its Victorian category, a Pandora's box that must never be opened. Webb and Hardy easily identify the man who opens it as a scoundrel. "Good" love, however, is sliding over the threshold into modernity, and we scarcely know by what name to call Marston and Clare. Transtextuality is most evident in Webb's characterizations, her three main characters bearing a parodic relation to Hardy's. While Tess is "backward," Hazel is positively antisocial. Tess appears primitive to Alec d'Urberville and Angel Clare because she lacks the affectations of their social class, but as Hardy insistently reminds us, she is a true aristocrat. In her occasional flashes of anger, she partakes of the frightening and austere viciousness of the "barbarian" upper class Matthew Arnold describes in Culture and Anarchy. The overbearing passion that causes her to murder d'Urberville places her in, rather than separating her from, the structuring classifications of her social world. And in the end, she acquiesces to its laws. Thus Tess is in the tradition of the noble slave. Because she has been physically misplaced in an abject posi- tion, her fatal unfitness for her station in life confirms rather than challenging the social structure. At her most rebellious, she fits into a literary context read- ily accessible to the reader. Although Tess's motivations are sometimes mad- deningly unclear, her actions and others' actions involving her can be under- stood in relation to familiar texts like ballads.26 Hazel is a young savage in- capable of obeying or even understanding any law except nature's. Because she 26 For a more detailed discussion of the correspondences between Hardy's major novels, including Tess, and traditional ballads see Donald Davidson, "The Traditional Basis of Thomas Hardy's Fiction" in Hardy: A Collectional of Critical Essays, ed.

She is far more savage than noble. Her pragmatic, self-absorbed personality more closely resembles that of the pet fox which Webb rather heavy-handedly lets us know represents her wild soul. Without religion and utterly impervious to socializing forces, Hazel seems incapable of understanding the mores that govern the other characters. In her solitary and companionable life with her father: "There was nothing filial about her or parental about him. Neither did they ever evince the least affection for each other."27 The tragedy of Hazel's subjugation does not, as in Tess's case, derive from our sense of an inversion of the normal order of things, but from our perception of her as displaced into a system in which she can see no meaning. Bowed down under the law of the fathers- when fatherhood is an empty word to her-the personification of noncompre- hension, she recalls the ghostlike natives that so horrify Marlow on his en- trance into the Belgian Congo, in Heart of Darkness. The special nature of her suffering, like theirs, makes us know how colonialism negates the concepts of law and criminality by rewriting the social contract as a bill of sale only the owner can read. By placing her "pure woman" permanently outside the social world the men in both Gone to Earth and Tess of the d'Urbervilles inhabit, Webb highlights the source of both heroines' attraction: the allure of the primitive. In Hardy's novel, the urge to possess a daughter of nature seems almost interchangeable with the urge to enter a country perceived as primitive. A seemingly reflexive projection of uncomplicated primitivism onto Tess is revealed in d'Urberville's continual astonishment that social rules affect her at all and Clare's fantasy that she grew up innocent as the first woman. D'Urberville's most socially cor- rect plan concerning her is that they go together to Africa. Clearly there is something in his passion for her incompatible with "civilized" life. Clare's passion is distinctly similar. When he learns of Tess's "sin," he recoils from her not only because he knows it will allow the social world to criticize his love and marriage but also because the marriage will redefine as a fall his rejection of his family's social life. In despair of achieving an entrance to the natural, edenic, pre-social world through marriage, Clare runs away to the wilds of back-country Brazil. Both Hardy and Webb emphasize the high-minded man's unconsciousness of this need to escape the demands of civilization. Like all British colonialists- in-good-faith, Clare and Marston believe that they are possessing primitive woman in order to lift her out of darkness. Clare begins his courtship of Tess with an offer of a course of instructive reading. He means to give her the "social assistance" of instruction in his more refined "manner and habits," "speech and phrases," and "likings and aversions" before they set out on their new, perhaps "colonial" life.28 Webb's reading of Hardy reveals the extent of the destruction in the wake of masochism that allows man glorious suffering in resistance to 27 Mary Webb, Gone to Earth (1917; reprint, New York, 1979) 15.

Like lands conquered by social rebels, she becomes the ground on which his defiance of the parent- country is enacted. But he is glamorized as an outcast in inverse relation to her forced repression into conformity. As much as Clare is in rebellion against his parents' social world and its system of mundane laws, he seems to see himself as an emissary of the higher, cultural aesthetics from which the social laws are derived. Marston simply turns Hazel over to his mother to be made into a lady. Tess of the d'Urbervilles achieves its most hopeful mood when Clare begins his education of Tess. Gone to Earth seems most ominous when we hear that, while Edward bravely battles against his own and his community's prejudices and received ideas, Hazel will be left under the instruction of his mother, who is "one of nature's opiates, and she administered herself unconsciously to everyone who saw much of her. Edward's father, having had an overdose had not survived" (58). In her characterizations of Mrs. Marston and Hazel's aunt Mrs. Prowde, Webb exaggerates the often wholesome seeming bourgeois propriety of the elder Clares into a deathliness that blights every life it touches. The parody and exaggeration in Webb's text is expanded into a direct contra- diction of the prior text in her revision of Hardy's depiction of Tess alienated from nature after her impregnation. When Tess wanders the "lonely hills and dales" imagining herself "a figure of Guilt intruding into the haunts of inno- cence," we are made to perceive her emotions as doubly ironic, first because d'Urberville has taken her for (and taken her because he believes she is) a sort of human animal to whom instinct must be the most binding law, and secondly, because she has not, as she weakly believes she has, broken any "law known to the environment in which she fancied herself such an anomaly" (134-35). Hardy implies that both her problem and her anguish are the result of mis- readings of her character. She cannot recognize her own nature or her place in nature, but Hardy, as omniscient artist, does. The subject-object relationship of male author-female protagonist is reenforced as we are shown that to the edu- cated eye Tess should figure not guilt but modernist alienation. And as such a figure she must always be denied the overview allowed to prescient males like her creator and Clare, who suffer from but do not represent the condition. Her entrapment by social rules, through which Clare learns and the narrator ex- plores the inescapability of the anti-natural world, is the more pitiable be- cause she submits to it ignorantly, the more foolish because if her morality were in harmony with her understanding she would repudiate her social definition as fallen. We feel for her to the extent that we do not share her perception; our sympathy must be mingled with a sort of contempt. The opposite is true when Webb parodies this section of Hardy's novel by showing the trees and flowers weeping as "they foreswore [Hazel's] company for ever" (205). Hazel's alienation from nature, after Reddin takes possession of her body, appears in the form of a battle between the domestic interior and wild exterior of his house, as the room that contains her comes under attack by personified plants and fills with nature's "subdued complaints and whisperings" (204). "It was almost as if the freemasonry of the green world was up in arms for Hazel. ... [because she] had now been plunged so deeply into human life that she was</page><page sequence="12">142 NOVEL I WINTER 1991 lost to it" (204). "Human" here seems to mean domestic, while nature is allied with art. "For the spirits of beauty and magic are (as the bondsman of colour knows and the bondsman of poetry) inimical to the ordinary life and destiny of man. They break up homes" (205). As the medium for an overarching vision that, could she attain it, would reconcile Tess to unwanted pregnancy, Hardy's art claims alliance with both nature and sexuality as the domestication of woman. It seems to aspire to build homes after the traditional pattern. And, in fact, Hardy's novels feature nostalgically presented cottages where quiet ac- ceptance of gender roles seems synonymous with the natural life. In contrast, Hazel is out of harmony with nature because she has been carried into domestic bondage. She suffers because her vision is artistic, natural, and so transcendent. We are invited to sympathize with her to the extent that we, like the narra- tor, share this anti-domestic aesthetic. The difference between the two passages can be partially understood in terms of historically bound concepts of the relationship between nature and art. Webb recalls the romanticism of Shelley and Keats, as well as the early Yeats, in her insistence that art, vision, and nature are one. Hardy's narrative pose is that of the new artist escaping from the cities, which are perceived as effeminizing, and nostalgically coming back to a manly life in nature, like Clym Yeobright in The Return of the Native, to create through his sophisticated, anatomizing, and ultimately colonizing gaze a landscape that is invisible to those who have al- ways inhabited it. However, the gendering of this difference, subtle in Hardy's novel, is emphatic in Gone to Earth. Hardy tells us that Tess mentally constructs the landscape that contains her, but it is a "sorry and mistaken creation" since "she was making a distinction where there was no difference" (134-35). As a championing of unwed mothers against conventional moral condemnation, the radicalism of this passage should not be underestimated. Nonetheless, it also implies not only the inferi- ority of Tess's creativity to the narrator's, but that the cause of this inferiority is her failure to recognize that her biological destiny negates her pretensions to autonomous desire. The passage suggests that if only she could accept her un- wanted defloration and pregnancy as part of nature's great plan, she would be content as the "skipping rabbits" and "sleeping birds" that surround her. Nature has no such plans in Gone to Earth. Hazel's perfect empathy with the natural world is lost because in her "sexual meeting" with Reddin, she is "merely passive," lacking the "passion pure and burning" that would accord with its spirit (205). As represented by Webb, this spirit is always opposed to anything that reinscribes the feminine sex role. Hazel's mother "had born her in bitter rebellion, hating marriage and a settled life and Abel Woodus as a wild cat hates a cage. She was a rover, born for the artist's joy and sorrow" (12). Apparently for Hardy, nature and woman are properly and most happily inter- twined specular creations of the (male) artist.29 Webb counters with a vision of natural female artistry continually threatened by men who, in attempting to 29 See Kaja Silverman, "History, Figuration, and Female Subjectivity in Tess of the d'Urbervilles," NOVEL 18 (Fall 1984) 21-28, for a persuasive account of the many ways in which Hardy suggests that the male gaze is essential to artistic creation.</page><page sequence="13">CAROL SIEGEL I MASOCHISM AND COLONIALISM 143 possess it through possession of the woman, actually stop it at its passionate source. Webb aligns herself with Hardy in showing considerable sympathy for men like Marston and Clare whose attitude toward woman-in-nature is initially reverent, who only intend to improve on paradise a little for its own good. These men, like Conrad's Kurtz before his fall, exemplify colonialism as the dissemination of cultural ideology masking unconscious flight from it. But the villainous d'Urberville and Reddin are depicted simply as imperialist ex- ploiters. Although neither man travels to foreign lands, each finds, in England, a country/woman to colonize. Their women become means of (re)production. That Tess's body functions as a piece of fertile ground is expressed indirectly through the harvest scene that frames our first view of her as a mother and ex- plicitly in the narrative statement that "a field woman is a portion of the field" (137). D'Urberville's utilitarian attitude toward Tess is most evident in that his initial courtship of her takes the form of employing her and teaching her to serve his mother. Despite his lack of interest in Tess's "product," their child, d'Urberville does take possession of the field-woman and make the once virgin land bear for him. Reddin seems to be literally after what he can get out of Hazel. Webb rarely mentions Reddin's desire for Hazel without also men- tioning his desire for a son. Like the land he farms and even more like the woods in which he hunts, Hazel represents to Reddin a wild territory to be in- vaded and made, in both senses of the word, to yield. Webb's narrative describes Reddin as sadistic and conventionally enough at- tributes his sadism to an "over-virility" that characterizes "the most rabid imperialists" (256). But this narrative classification seems unreliable because it is only in action that his conquest and possession of Hazel look sadistic. At the level of his urge to possess, he appears, like d'Urberville, markedly masochistic. Each finds the woman attractive in proportion to the seriousness of her demonstrations of contempt for him, and all evidence that her coldness can never change inflames him further. Part of d'Urberville's complexity comes from his readiness to reveal masochistic leanings that seem inappropriate to his bullying style. We might remember that before Tess, his favorite was "a dark virago, Car Darch, dubbed Queen of Spades" (110). However, Hardy anticipates Havelock Ellis in sug- gesting that both behaviors are expressions of the same drive; lust for conquest shows its reverse as "devotional passion" (383). D'Urberville seems fond of us- ing the language of submission to Tess: "I have no right but to obey" (397). That these courtly tones are not ironic seems clear from his perception of his own pas- sion for her as a force to which he must "give way" (401). Both his and Reddin's impulses toward conquest are inextricably connected to their impulses to lose control. As much as they want to enter primitive and unknown territory, they seem to need to be received savagely by it. The woman's insurmountable resis- tance seems necessary to preserve the boundaries between them. By dwelling on what Hardy omits, the grotesque domestic life of the imperialist-seducer and his conquest, Webb stresses the interplay of male needs which depends upon the repression of female desire.</page><page sequence="14">144 NOVEL I WINTER 1991 However, it is in the treatment of the would-be altruistic colonialist impulse that Webb's novel best provides a commentary on Hardy's. Although Hardy has much to say about inevitability in Tess of the d'Urbervilles, he has made it difficult for the reader to avoid feeling Tess's tragic fate is the direct result of Clare's foolish decision to leave her after the marriage. We are shown that Clare wants Tess to be an unapproachable goddess, "Artemis, Demeter," and thus is most moved by her when she has "the cold gleam" of northern light on her face (187). This attitude seems to inform his decision to "make a confession to her" before consummating their marriage (291). It may also inform his deci- sion not to consummate the marriage at all, because in denying himself sexual satisfaction, even though on the grounds that she is unworthy, Clare ensures the prolongation of his excitingly tormenting desire. Webb is much more emphatic than Hardy in blaming her heroine's tragedy on the man who denies himself sexual pleasure. Although the narrator praises Marston's "altruism," Webb dramatizes his behavior through the imagery of masochistic ritual. Like James Joyce, she makes masochism look simultaneously ridiculous and seductive as Marston rejects "the norm," his previous love of "ordinary things," "Church and State," and "the letter of the law," in favor of a voluptuously intense, self-torturing celibacy in which his Bible becomes an anthology of erotica, full of "sweet, frank love-stories ... that would, if written by a novelist, be banned" (127-29). While she concentrates on showing the sorry results of masochism's misuse, Webb suggests its potential for deliciously dis- ruptive pleasure. Because of Reddin's active sexuality, Marston tells him, "You are not a man ... you are nothing but sex organs" (274). Marston ecstatically af- firms his own male identity, on his knees before the bridal bed he will never enter. Even when he realizes that, as we are told, "it was his own love that had destroyed them both," or rather, as we are shown, his particular way of expressing it, Marston still continues to deny himself and his wife sexual inter- course (265). Yet, as Webb repeatedly reminds us, were it possible for Hazel to survive as a woman without a master, Marston's remoteness from his bride might be beneficial to her; it might give her remarkably unsocialized responses to life room to develop. It is not simply the self-denying masochism of the men around her that oppresses Hazel but its combination with impulses to control and possess her. In Hardy's novel, d'Urberville tells Tess he is giving up his Evangelical mis- sion for her sake because "I thought I worshipped on the mountains, but I find I still serve in the groves" (402). In Gone to Earth, Marston's parsonage is on "God's Little Mountain" and Reddin's house is set in a cherry grove. Tess and Hazel are claimed both according to the laws of nature and the old gods and ac- cording to the Judeo-Christian tradition and the social laws it has created. Yet, no matter where the heroine is placed by the men who desire her, no matter whether she is sexually possessed or only legally owned, she remains, at the insistence of the men's masochistic needs, cold, other, colonized. Hardy tells us that in their sexual histories Tess and Clare are "doubles" (291-92). But in their sexual needs, he implies, they differ fatally. In the final section, entitled "Fulfillment," we last see Clare with his sister-in-law, pre-</page><page sequence="15">CAROL SIEGEL I MASOCHISM AND COLONIALISM 145 sumably intending to offer her the protection of marriage, as Tess has requested. He has previously said that sex with her would be incest. Appropriately, she is a "spiritualized image of Tess, slighter" (488). This conclusion perversely hints that men find their fulfillment in celibacy, which in this particular case is brought about by the desiring woman's execution. Tess's meaning is created by the complicated game of male desire and self-denial in which she is a counter taken for a goal. As a human colony, she has her meaning only in relation to man, the colonizer's, masochistic sexual economy. Her own motivational opacity helps create her iconic purity. Her idealiza- tion has much in common with the "compassion as contempt" which, in an otherwise often annoying account of Western leftism, Pascal Bruckner claims post-colonialists extend to their former subjects. Here, as in the type of rhetoric he attacks, masochistically harsh criticism of one's own group depends upon denial of subjecthood to the supposedly defended victim.30 As Renato Rosaldo more perceptively points out, the confessional posturing of the servant of impe- rialism when he is struck by nostalgia for what he has helped destroy origi- nates in the same "ethic of masculine heroics" that inspire colonial conquests in the first place."3 Agonizing (voluptuously?) over the loss of the beloved, the male subject appears more a hero than before. Part of the sublime pathos of Hardy's novel's conclusion is that Clare's life continues to mean something when Tess is gone. When we have nothing left to wonder about Tess, we still see Clare and must take him as the tragic center of the bit of the story that is left. Such later modernist anticolonialist novels as Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea and Doris Lessing's The Grass is Singing similarly rely on the continuance of the reader's interest in the conquering male to lend additional meaning to the story of his colonization and destruction of a woman. As a response to Jane Eyre, Rhys's novel, whatever it says about its protagonist, must always also answer the question posed by the prior text, "What does his first marriage reveal about Rochester?" The murder of the female protagonist of Lessing's novel is framed by visions of the devastation of each of the men who loved her and pre- sented through a young male colonist whose responses to the new land it will determine. Although both novels make important feminist points, they still as- sign woman the role of sacrificial victim whose death helps us know politi- cally empowered man and the world his imperial presence defines. Just as, early in the novel, Hazel refuses to see meaning in self-sacrifice and declares "if so be any's got to die; I'll die for myself," Webb refuses to bring her novel to a conclusion beyond the record of Hazel's absence (100). Hazel's death does not let us see through our cathartic tears what has been left behind; it obliterates the world that had held her. The earth and sky freeze, "the righ- teous men and the hunt cease to be people of any class or time or creed" (288). The systems by which meanings are made are rolled away. Webb's novel pro- vides a defiant vision of a female otherness that cannot be appropriated to sat- isfy male needs. Webb suggests that while, from Hardy's masculine perspec- Pascal Bruckner, The Tears of the White Man: Compassion as Contempt, trans. William R.

Webb's revision reveals not only that Hardy's novel is in a sense a critique of colonialism, but that its own aesthetics, because of their basis in a masculinist masochism, are colonialist. Webb's own aesthetics are anti-colonial, the primacy of meaning of the colonized land/woman is stressed. Hardy's gods take up another fly, but Webb's game is over when the vixen has gone to earth.</page></plain_text>
