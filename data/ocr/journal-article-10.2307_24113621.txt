<plain_text><page sequence="1">Deceitful Tongues: Is Climate Change Denial a Crime? William C. Tucker* The consequences of global warming and associated climate changes are now apparent. No longer can there be any doubt that anthropogenic (human caused) warming of the Earth is happening, caused mainly by greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon dioxide, from burning fossil fuels. Climate change poses a grave threat to humankind. The world is already experiencing the consequences of global warming: more frequent and prolonged droughts, increasingly severe and more frequent storms, rising sea levels worldwide threatening coastal and vulnerable island populations, the melting of mountain glaciers and polar ice sheets, increased intensity of tropical cyclones and hurricanes, and more frequent and widespread fires. Without immediate action to curb greenhouse gas emissions, climate change can only get worse. In the period since the issue of global warming was brought to the attention of the general public in the late 1980s, both the legislative and the executive branches of the United States government have launched a number of initiatives to assess the threat and formulate policies to address it. Nevertheless, two decades later the United States government has failed to take effective measures to address climate change domestically or to assert international leadership on achieving meaningful carbon emission reductions. It is now well-documented that a shift in public opinion and failure of political will on climate change took place at the turn of the millennium, a change which can be largely attributed to a sophisticated, nationwide public relations campaign designed to conceal the dangers of burning fossil fuels from the American public by deceiving it as to the true state of climate science.

The climatic impacts of releasing fossil fuel CO 2 to the atmosphere will last longer than Stonehenge. Longer than time capsules, longer than nuclear waste, far longer than the age of human civilization so far. Each ton of coal that we burn leaves C02 gas in the atmosphere. The CO 2 coming from a quarter of that ton will still be affecting the climate one thousand years from now, at the start of the next millennium. —David Archer1 Global warming and climate change are undeniable. There has been little doubt among the majority of climate scientists for at least two decades that anthropogenic (human-caused) warming of the Earth is happening, and the main cause is greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, primarily carbon dioxide (C02), from burning fossil fuels.2 The impacts of climate change on humanity, 1.

In June 1988, during a severe heat wave, Dr. James Hansen, currently a Columbia University Professor and Director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Institute for Space Studies, announced to a Senate committee that: "It's time to stop waffling . . . and say that the greenhouse effect is here and is affecting our climate now."4 As a result of press coverage of the committee's proceedings, the climate change issue seemed to move "from science to the policy realm almost overnight,"5 and by the end of 1988, thirty-two climate-related bills had been introduced in Congress.6 Yet none of them became law, and more than two decades later the United States has still failed to take meaningful steps to address climate change at home or to provide international leadership on the issue. What brought about this change in public opinion and loss of political consensus at the tum of the millennium? It is now well-documented that, since the early 1990s, there has been a sustained and coordinated public relations effort by certain energy companies and related industries, modeled on prior deceptive practices of the tobacco industry ("Big Tobacco"), to deceive the public about the true state of climate science in order to allow energy companies to continue to profit from C02 emissions without governmental regulation. In two books, The Heat is On and Boiling Point, the American journalist Ross Gelbspan first exposed an organized effort, largely funded by the coal and oil industries, to fool the public into believing that climate science was in a state of controversy, when in fact—as those behind the effort knew quite well, or certainly should have—no such controversy existed.7 Other Greenhouse Economics 12, 13 (2002) (noting that a "scientific consensus" had developed in 1985)); Union of Concerned Scientists, Smoke, Mirrors &amp; Hot Air, 29-30 (2007) available at http:// www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/global_warming/exxon_report.pdf [hereinafter Smoke, Mirrors] (noting in Appendix A, The Scientific Consensus on Global Warming, that scientific consensus exists that recent global warming is due to human activity, as found by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2001). 3.

A national survey of 2001 adults conducted in 2011 by the Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press found a deep divide in the public's understanding of climate change. The survey reported that: 63% say there is solid evidence that the earth's average temperature has been getting warmer over the past few decades . . . [but] nearly four-in-ten (38%) say that global warming is occurring mostly because of human activity, such as the burning of fossil fuels. . . . The survey finds a continuing partisan divide in opinions about global warming: 77% of Democrats and 63% of independents say there is solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades. Just 43% of Republicans agree. There also is a large partisan gap in views about the causes of global warming: 51% of Democrats and 40% of independents say the earth is getting warmer mostly because of human activity. Just 19% of Republicans say rising temperatures are mostly attributable to human activity.10 Thus, we currently find ourselves without the political will to effect meaningful reductions in GHG emissions at a time when the urgency of the crisis grows upon us daily, when we cannot afford to, as James Hansen put it as early as 1988, "waffle" any more without endangering the future of humanity}^ Yet attempting to curb corporate political speech or expression of "opinion" through legal action under United States law is fraught with constitutional peril.

Put another way, every debate is "unsettled" which is based on lies. Our legal system depends upon the ubiquitous injunction to speak truth.16 This imperative is at least as old as the Magna Carta, which provides that all its liberties and rights "in their fulness and entirety" shall be observed forever "in good faith and without deceit."17 Furthermore, truth is the common standard which undergirds all our private, commercial and public dealings. All our financial transactions require it: where truth is wanting, massive financial institutions fall like houses of cards; great businesses fail which cannot meet their pledged obligations. Truth is an imperative in the cloistered pursuit of science: indeed, it is the very definition of science—there is no science without it. Scholarship and education decay to propaganda and indoctrination starved of it. The institution of marriage and even the bonds of friendship depend on it. Nor can democracy, which depends for its survival upon the open and free exchange of ideas, long survive when those ideas are calculated to deceive. We simply cannot govern ourselves as a nation or community of nations if the public debate on our future as a society is poisoned by deceit. The human race now faces a climate crisis of staggering proportions, largely as a result of our failure to take effective steps to address it in time, a failure which may be attributed in substantial part to the deceptive public 12.

Is it possible that our system of laws is impotent in the face of immoral behavior as potentially devastating to humanity as this? It may not be. In 2009, the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed District Court Judge Kessler's holding in a groundbreaking civil suit against the tobacco industry brought by the U.S. Department of Justice and a number of state attorneys general.18 In that case, the district court held that for nearly half a century Big Tobacco defrauded the general public by misrepresenting the health effects of smoking through the very public relations and advertising practices upon which the deceptive climate change "denial" campaign is modeled.19 Similarly, the deception practiced upon the public by some within the fossil fuel industry and its allies and dependents is arguably fraudulent under a number of federal statutes, in particular, those prohibiting mail/wire fraud and conspiracies to defraud the U.S. government. This Article will examine whether it can be regarded as such a crime based not just upon the selfish motives of its perpetrators, but on its consequences', the catastrophic and global devastation which is the highly likely fruit of its success.

It is no coincidence that, at about the same time, a sustained and sophisticated public relations campaign was undertaken by the fossil fuel industry to deceive the public about climate science. Its purpose was to avoid governmental regulation of carbon emissions by concealing the environmental harm they cause from the public and governmental decision-makers. It has, regrettably, succeeded, as is apparent both in widespread public confusion regarding climate change and in U.S. governmental paralysis in addressing the problem. A. Climate Change and Its Effects GHGs are gases that tend to trap solar energy, heating the Earth. They include, in order of importance for climate change, C02, methane (CH4), halocarbons (including chlorofluorocarbons or Freons), nitrous oxide (N20), and ozone (O3).22 "Black carbon" aerosols (soot) from a variety of human sources, although not nearly as long-lasting in the atmosphere as C02 and other greenhouse gases, also contribute to warming.23 Deforestation also plays a significant warming role, since it depletes the carbon "sink" available to reabsorb C02.24 Natural (that is, non-human caused) climate "forcings"25 include volcanic eruptions (producing sulfur dioxide aerosols which have a cooling effect), other naturally-occurring reflective aerosols (including clouds) which reflect solar radiation back into space, and variations in solar intensity (orbital "wobbles," changes in distance of the Earth to the sun, and sunspot global average net effect of human activities since 1750 has been one of warming"). In addition, "[m]ost of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-twentieth century is very likely [90 percent or more] due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations." Id. at 10; "The primary source of the increased atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide since the pre industrial period results from fossil fuel use, with land-use change providing another significant but smaller contribution."

Note that all human-caused aerosols, which include black carbon, have a net cooling effect. However, reductions in particulate air pollution due to health concerns will decrease that effect over time, and aerosols (including black carbon) only last days in the atmosphere, requiring continual replenishment to maintain any cooling effect. C02, in contrast, lasts centuries.

Based on ice cores from the oldest sheets in Antarctica and Greenland, we now have a fairly complete picture of C02 atmospheric concentrations, global temperatures, and sea levels extending back far beyond recorded human history and even the 26.

Naturally-occurring water vapor is also a greenhouse gas, although it is difficult to characterize it as entirely "natural," since as the Earth's atmosphere warms it absorbs more water vapor—a "positive" (or warming) feedback further contributing to global warming.

The coldest periods or ice ages, when New York's Manhattan was buried under an ice sheet over a mile thick, occurred when C02 levels were at a minimum of around 200 ppm. The highest C02 concentrations of around 300 ppm occurred during the most extreme periods of warmth, such as the Eemian some 100 to 150 millennia ago, when global temperatures were similar to the pre-industrial temperatures of our own time.35 Today, by contrast, the Keeling measurements show that atmospheric C02 concentrations of 315 ppm initially found in 1958 have risen to over 392 ppm, an increase nearly equal to the entire range of C02 concentrations going back 425,000 years.36 And, as might be expected, despite the thermal inertia of the oceans37 the Earth is rapidly warming as a result. The surface thermometer record, which only goes back to the mid-nineteenth century, reveals that global surface air temperatures rose by about 0.7 degrees C° over the twentieth century, with warming during the last half of the century nearly double that of the first half.38 Satellite temperature measurements of the lower troposphere also show a warming trend globally: between 1979 and 2004, global average temperatures warmed between 0.12 and 0.19 degrees C° per decade.39 Balloon data show a similar trend: between 1958 and 2004, a warming of 0.16 degrees C° per decade occurred.40 The top layer of the world's oceans is also warming.41 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded in its 2007 Report that "eleven of the last twelve years (1995-2006) rank among the twelve warmest years in the instrumental record of global surface temperatures (since 1850)."42 34.

Glaciers are retreating around the world, with global warming cited as the obvious cause.43 Sea levels have risen on average fifteen centimeters over the twentieth century due to thermal expansion and melting sea ice, and the rate of that increase has been accelerating in recent decades.44 Arctic sea ice area has decreased by 2.7 percent per decade over the past three decades, with declines in the summer minimum, when ice cover is at its least extent, of 7.4 percent per decade.45 Other observations of global warming include: decreased Northern Hemisphere snow cover, thawing of Arctic permafrost, strengthening of mid-latitude westerly winds, fewer extreme cold events and more extreme hot events, increased precipitation events, shorter winter ice season on lakes, and thousands of observed biological and ecological changes consistent with warming (e.g., poleward expansion of species ranges, earlier spring flowering and insect emergence, etc.).46 There are three reasons why anyone in possession of this information should be concerned. The first is that global C02 atmospheric concentrations are increasing at an accelerating rate due to an increase in fossil fuel use by a growing population.47 The second reason is that during the past decade or so a number of unexpected events indicate that "feedback" mechanisms could accelerate the warming process beyond the possibility of human intervention (called the "runaway greenhouse") once certain "tipping points" are passed, if fossil fuel use continues to grow indefinitely (a scenario described as "business as usual" by climate scientists).48 The third reason is that we are running out of time: there is an urgency to this problem which grows daily because mitigation of GHG emissions must be accomplished over the next two decades sufficient 43.

The two main feedbacks accelerating the warming process are (1) the ice albedo effect, loss of reflectivity as sea ice melts leaving open water to absorb nearly all solar radiation falling upon it, which accelerates melting, and (2) the increase of water vapor in the atmosphere from warmer oceans: water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas, further accelerating the warming process.

"[M]ost of the climate response to fossil fuel emissions will occur within centuries," says Hansen, "much of it within the lifetimes of our children and grandchildren."52 Even without such apocalyptic consequences, the impacts of climate change on humanity are predicted to be severe. They include increasingly violent and more frequent storms resulting in widespread flooding and wind damage; more frequent and prolonged droughts devastating agriculture and livestock; more frequent and larger fires threatening crops, timber, homes, and population centers; the melting of mountain glaciers leading to dry rivers in the late summer and fall depriving billions of people of fresh water for drinking and agriculture; melting polar ice sheets contributing to already rising sea levels threatening coastal and vulnerable island populations; and increased intensity of tropical cyclones and hurricanes that place large, coastal cities at grave risk.53 Adding to the crisis we face is that C02 concentrations in the atmosphere are long-lived: they remain there for centuries or even millennia.54 Of the C02 emitted today, 25 percent will still remain in the atmosphere a thousand years from now.55 In addition, there is currently a substantial global "energy imbalance": by 2005, each square meter of Earth's land and ocean surface was absorbing about one watt more radiant energy than it was re emitting as thermal energy, leaving 0.6 degree C° of additional warming "in the pipeline," that is, unavoidable no matter what mitigation measures we adopt.56 49.

U.S. Governmental Efforts to Address the Problem The threat we face from global warming has been magnified by our failure, at the national level, to assess the full impact of the problem, disseminate that information to the public, formulate national strategies to address it, and cooperate with the world community in finding international solutions. There has been no lack of scientific and public attention paid to global warming in recent years,58 but meaningful action to address it still eludes us, despite a number of national governmental attempts over the past several decades to assess the state of the climate. As early as 1979, the National Academy of Sciences issued a report, authored by Jules Charney, which warned of significant climate changes if C02 emissions continued to increase.59 The 1979 "Charney Report" found that: [f]or more than a century, we have been aware that changes in the composition of the atmosphere could affect its ability to trap the sun's energy for our benefit. We now have incontrovertible evidence that the atmosphere is indeed changing and that we ourselves contribute to that change. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide are steadily increasing, and these changes are linked with man's use of fossil fuels and exploitation of the land. Since carbon dioxide plays a significant role in the heat budget of the atmosphere, it is reasonable to suppose that continued increases would affect climate.60 The Report concluded that "if carbon dioxide continues to increase, the study group finds no reason to doubt that climate changes will result and no reason to data from 3400 "Argo" floats, instruments that directly monitor the temperature, pressure, and salinity of the upper ocean to a depth of 2000 meters, confirm that Earth's "energy imbalance" is currently 0.58 watts per square meter.

[which] is already large enough to begin to affect the probability of extreme events such as summer heat waves . . . and it is changing our climate now."70 Hansen famously added in comments to journalists that: "It's time to stop waffling so much. It's time to say the earth is getting warmer."71 As one writer puts it: "no one seemed to be confused about climate change in 1988."72 David Suzuki, Professor Emeritus in genetics at the University of British Columbia, founder of the David Suzuki Foundation and long-time climate activist, sums up the state of public awareness of climate change in 1988 this way: In 1988, the environment was the number one concern of people around the world.

Bush promised, if elected, to be "an environmental president." In 1988, Brian Mulroney was reelected prime minister in Canada and, to show he cared about the environment, he appointed his brightest star, Lucien Bouchard, as minister of the environment. I interviewed Bouchard three months later and asked what he felt was the most urgent environmental issue for Canadians. His instant response was, "Global warming." When I asked how serious it was, he replied, "It threatens the survival of our species. We have to act now."73 Yet by the early 1990s, public concern about climate change began to wane. As David Suzuki continues, in 1988 "[scientists had spoken, the public was concerned, and politicians had gotten the message," but not only did we not take on the challenge, corporations "began to spend millions" on a public relations campaign to confuse the public and spread disinformation. And, he concludes, "it worked."74 Despite growing public apathy, by the early 1990s a clear consensus was emerging among climate scientists that human-caused global warming was underway and posed a threat to humankind. Naomi Oreskes, a professor of history and science studies at the University of California, San Diego, published a paper in the journal Science in 2005, in which she found that, of 928 refereed scientific journal articles concerning global climate change published between 1993 and 2003 selected at random, not a single one opposed that consensus opinion.75 However, during the 1990s, the United States began to move away from meaningful action to address climate change, at the very time the scientific community was forming itself into the solid consensus found in Professor Oreskes's study.76 Although George W. Bush ran in 2000 on a pro-environmental platform, recommending designating CO2 as a "pollutant" under the Clean Air Act to enable EPA regulation and favoring "cap-and-trade" legislation for GHG emissions, shortly after taking office he abruptly reneged on both pledges, renouncing the Kyoto Protocol in the process.77 While significant steps to control GHG emissions were taken by the European Union during the Bush years, including agreement among member nations on a cap-and-trade system to meet the Kyoto reductions, the United States continued to adhere to the position that developing nations must commit to mandatory GHG reductions before the United States would agree to them, accompanied by the belief that 73.

The Denial Machine What is the explanation for this abrupt change in governmental policy and public awareness at the turn of the century? It is by now well-documented that over the past several decades there has been a sustained and well-funded public relations effort by certain energy interests to deceive the public about the true state of climate science. The goal is to so confuse the media, the public and government officials that a majority of Americans come to believe that climate science is so "uncertain" that governmental action to curb GHG emissions would be premature or harmful to the economy.79 From the beginning, the campaign employed all the well-honed tools of public relations developed earlier by Big Tobacco:80 the use of "front groups" funded by the fossil fuel industry, including biased "think tanks"; fake "Astroturf' grass-roots organizations and established trade associations willing to assist in the effort;81 the recruitment and funding of scientists (of any discipline) skilled at public relations and willing to oppose the "conventional" viewpoint on climate change;82 the use of a media "echo chamber" to repeat and amplify their message;83 the use of dubious "petitions" to create the false impression of disputes among climate scientists;84 ad hominem attacks, including "SLAPP" suits, against legitimate climate scientists to intimidate them and discredit their research;85 the use of established public relations methods such as focus-group testing, polling, advertising, mass mailings, "educational" materials distributed to schools, and biased internet sites, to spread their doctrine and gauge progress toward the "goal" of perpetual public doubt;86 and finally, an unrelenting attack on science itself, a tactic developed earlier by Big Tobacco to discredit research showing the harmful effects of smoking.87 The media's perceived obligation to 78.

One of the earliest of the campaign's "front groups" was The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition ("TASSC"), formed initially in 1993 by Big Tobacco "with the goal of discrediting the mainstream science establishing the health hazards of second-hand tobacco smoke."89 As may be apparent from its name, TASSC originally coined the deceptive terms "junk science" (to refer to legitimate mainstream, peer-reviewed science) and "sound science" (to mean industry-funded pseudo-science).90 The use of the Orwellian terms "junk science" and "sound science" to mean their opposites has since been widely adopted by climate change deniers to confuse and mislead the public. Another early denialist group, originally created for the purpose of defeating the Kyoto Protocol, was the Global Climate Coalition (GCC). The GCC, a coalition of oil companies, electric utilities, automobile manufacturers and others, was founded in 1989,91 when it began a "multimillion dollar advertising campaign" to ensure the U.S. would not agree to binding emissions cuts under Kyoto without "meaningful participation of key developing countries" such as China and India.92 It appears to have disbanded by 2002.93 In 1991, certain coal and electric utility interests94 founded the Information Council on the Environment, with the convenient acronym "ICE."95 ICE's goal was "to reposition global warming as a theory (not fact)" and "supply alternative facts to support the suggestion that global warming will be good."96 ICE denigrated global warming "theory" through radio advertising and mass mailings, using "cherry-picked" data to draw deceptive conclusions.

The video's argument was that, since plants need CO2, an increase in atmospheric CO2 will contribute to a more fertile world, with the implication that climate change, if it exists, will be entirely benign.100 In 1998 a task force of energy industry representatives including several prominent members of the GCC, calling themselves the "Global Climate Science Communications Team" (GCSCT), drafted a public relations strategy document called the "Global Climate Science Communication Action Plan" ("Action Plan" or "Plan"), which later was obtained by Greenpeace and posted on its website.101 The Action Plan outlined a multimillion-dollar public relations strategy to foment "uncertainty" on the issue of global warming, modeled on Big Tobacco's "sound science" disinformation campaign. Despite growing scientific consensus that the climate was increasingly endangered by fossil fuel use, the Plan's "Project Goal" was to sow doubt about that consensus to manipulate public opinion: "A majority of the American public, including industry leadership, recognizes that significant uncertainties exist in climate science, and therefore raises questions among those (e.g. Congress) who chart the future U.S. course on global climate change."102 "Victory," in the words of the Plan, will be achieved when: —Average Citizens "understand" (recognize) uncertainties in climate science; recognition of uncertainties becomes part of the "conventional wisdom" —Media "understands" (recognizes) uncertainties in climate science —Media coverage reflects balance on climate science and recognition of the validity of viewpoints that challenge the current "conventional wisdom " 97.

Like the campaign by Big Tobacco to conceal the dangers of smoking from the public, the purpose is to indefinitely forestall governmental response to a crisis. That this plan of deception would be at the expense of the environment should have been apparent to those involved in the deceit, including officers of large energy companies whose fiscal duty is to understand and anticipate the environmental impacts of their corporate actions.115 Yet the environmental consequences of their actions seem to have been given little or no consideration. It will be immediately clear to many that the public relations effort to confuse the public about climate change described above is unethical; however, that alone doesn't make it criminal. To determine if such behavior rises to the level of crime, it first may be useful to examine the question from a philosophical perspective. Historically, there are two rationales under which deception has been condemned by philosophers: the first maintains that the act of lying is morally wrong in and of itself, whereas the second looks to the effects of the lie and the harm it may potentially cause to determine if the lie is severe enough to warrant legal prohibition.116 The first view is generally called 113.

Focusing on the effects of a deception, in contrast to the deontological theory, is termed the "consequentialist" or harm-oriented view— the germ of which can be found in the utilitarian writings of John Stuart Mill. In this view, the criminality of an act of deception can be found not so much in the intrinsic immorality of the act itself as in the degree of harm it has the potential to produce, that is, in its consequences. What, then, are the consequences of the program of deceit outlined above? Certainly, the deception itself must be morally condemned. But more than that, the perpetrators of this deception must have been aware that its foreseeable impacts could be devastating for both the human race and the Earth itself. It is not enough to say that the motives of deniers are less than vile; that they are simply guilty of a moral lapse in their zeal to protect the interests of their clients or shareholders. To say that implies that guarding the profits of fossil fuel companies, a purpose in and of itself without moral stigma, wholly absolves the denier of fraud in the service of that motive and all responsibility for the foreseeable consequences of the fraud to humankind. Although the actus reus is different, the same might be said of Jack the Ripper, whose underlying motives were never ascertained and will in all likelihood remain forever a mystery.118 In both instances, it is primarily the effects, not the motive, that steep a morally reprehensible act in criminality. The behavior of deniers is fundamentally and thoroughly deceptive: it sounds in fraud, not just based on the motives of its perpetrators, but because the foreseeable consequences of their acts are so grave. In a worst-case scenario, continued "business as usual" could cause the climate to pass "tipping points" leading to runaway warming that could spell the extermination of the human race and even the end of the Earth as a planet capable of sustaining life.119 Even without such an unthinkable outcome, the effects on humanity and its institutions will likely be devastating, long-lasting and lethal. Misrepresentation, deceit or fraud is actionable in tort in a variety of contexts. Such actions may be based on the statutory and common law offenses of false pretenses (false representation of fact designed to deprive the victim of property or other pecuniary loss), defamation, and misrepresentation in 117.

[It] includes anything calculated to deceive, whether it be a single act or combination of circumstances, whether the suppression of truth or the suggestion of what is false, whether it be by direct falsehood or by innuendo, by speech or by silence, by word of mouth, or by look or gesture.124 This shows that fraud is not a defined crime with prescribed elements.125 Judge Holmes of the Fifth Circuit put it this way: "[T]he law does not define fraud; it needs no definition; it is as old as falsehood and as versable as human ingenuity."126 Because criminal fraud takes a variety of forms, the precise definition of fraudulent conduct varies according to the statute under which it is criminalized.127 In English law, acts of criminal fraud were originally punished 120.

Philip Morris, discussed supra, was brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). RICO requires the plaintiffs to establish "a pattern of racketeering activity" or conspiracy to engage in racketeering under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d), as well as the elements of the underlying conduct constituting the racketeering acts, in that case numerous instances of mail and wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343.136 Thus, the "generic" or common law offense of mail/wire fraud as embodied in federal law may form the basis for both civil and criminal actions for fraudulent or deceptive conduct under other federal statutes.137 which are contradicted by prevailing authority or research."

This entails two lines of inquiry: first, does the deceptive behavior defraud individual citizens or the public generally under the "generic" federal mail and wire fraud statutes, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343; and second, does the behavior defraud the government under the "conspiracy to defraud the United States" statute, 18 U.S.C. § 371?138 A. Mail/Wire Fraud The federal mail and wire fraud statutes are generic criminal fraud statutes. The elements of mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341 are fairly straightforward in that the government must prove: (1) a scheme to defraud, and (2) the use of the mails for the purpose of executing that scheme.139 The statute of limitations for mail or wire fraud is five years under § 3282, except that it becomes ten years "if the offense affects a financial institution" under § 3293(2). Prosecution is timely as long as the execution of the scheme through use of the mails comes within the limitations period, even though the scheme itself may have been in existence prior to the statutory period.140 Maximum damages and attorney's fees by private litigants under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) are not precluded under the Philip Morris Disgorgement Opinion. The RICO statute reads in part: The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of section 1962 of this chapter by issuing appropriate orders, including, but not limited to: ordering any person to divest himself of any interest, direct or indirect, in any enterprise; imposing reasonable restrictions on the fiiture activities or investments of any person, including, but not limited to, prohibiting any person from engaging in the same type of endeavor as the enterprise engaged in, the activities of which affect interstate or foreign commerce; or ordering dissolution or reorganization of any enterprise, making due provision for the rights of innocent persons. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(a) (2006). 138.

Nor should the common law requirement that the deceitful speech be "material" pose an obstacle in the climate change denial context, given the obvious and significant importance of the facts of climate change to a "reasonable person," including all consumers of fossil fuels. The D.C. Circuit held in Philip Morris that the "materiality requirement is met if the matter at issue is 'of importance to a reasonable person in making a decision about a particular matter or transaction.'"145 It would be difficult for defendants in a climate change fraud action to plausibly maintain that the widespread and catastrophic environmental effects predicted 141. 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (2006).

Yet there may be three principal challenges under United States law to allegations of fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation in the context of climate change denial: (1) the robustness of the First Amendment to the Constitution in protecting free speech and association; (2) the necessity of proving fraudulent intent to participate in a "scheme to defraud" on the part of individual defendants; and (3) the need under the "generic" mail/wire fraud statutes to show the "scheme to defraud" entailed the deprivation of a victim's money or property. These challenges, though grounded in legal precedent, may be overcome in the following ways. 1. Constitutional Issues The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects both corporate speech and association, and will certainly be interposed as the principal objection to a charge of climate change denier fraud. This is particularly to be expected if the speech objected to includes attempting to influence government through lobbying or expression of opinion on matters of public policy. Yet the First Amendment has never been held to protect dishonest or fraudulent speech in any context, whether "commercial" or "political" in content, and the same principle applies to climate change denial. Corporations engaging in such denial, through their own statements or through those of their surrogates, are certain to raise the First Amendment as their primary defense if challenged. Indeed, the federal courts have traditionally afforded corporate speech broad latitude as free speech protected by the Constitution. Corporations as "persons" under the Fourteenth Amendment enjoy the protection of the First Amendment to report the news,146 broadcast television programs,147 and advertise.148 Corporations enjoy the "right to petition the government, the right to speak out on matters of public concern, and the right to associate with others."149 Thus, corporations cannot be held liable for lobbying activities if that would impede "the free flow of information to governmental decision-makers."150 Nor can liability be premised on the "collective efforts of groups and organizations to influence government action," since such collective action has been held protected by both the rights of speech 146.

[b]ut there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact."158 Opinion, no matter how "pernicious," should "depend for its correction not on the conscience of judges and juries but on the competition of other ideas."159 Judge Learned Hand summarized the protections afforded by the First Amendment to matters of public debate as follows: The First Amendment "presupposes that right conclusions are more likely to be gathered out of a multitude of tongues, than through any kind of authoritative selection. To many this is, and always will be, folly; but we have staked upon it our all."160 151. Id. at 562 (citing Cal. Motor Transp. Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 50S, 510-11 (1972)). This is known as the "Noerr-Pennington" doctrine, which protects "petitioners" attempting to influence government action. See United Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 670 (1965); E. R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 136 (1961).

Thus, "non-violent, lawful" collective action of an organization is protected and liability must be imposed based on an individual member's own conduct and speech.161 The climate change denial campaign has largely been carried out through corporate-funded "front" groups, including public relations firms, seeded "grass roots" or "Astroturf ' organizations, conservative "think tanks," trade associations, non-profit institutes, and other organizations.162 Linking the actions of those groups to the corporations or individuals providing their funding may be viewed as an attempt to restrict their First Amendment rights of association. This assumes, however, that the groups possess "lawful" goals. The Supreme Court has held that "[f]or liability to be imposed by reason of association alone, it is necessary to establish that the group itself possessed unlawful goals and that the individual held a specific intent to further those illegal aims."163 Applying this principle to corporate associations, Judge Alito writing for the Third Circuit held that a corporation (Pfizer) could not be held liable based on its membership, funding, and attendance at meetings of a lobbying trade organization alone.164 The plaintiffs had contended that "the [trade association] disseminated misleading information about the danger of asbestos in schools . . . designed to reduce or limit Pfizer's and the other defendants' liability exposure ... by encouraging [plaintiffs] either not to abate or to use cheaper abatement methods."165 "If true," the court stated, "these allegations might satisfy the elements of fraudulent misrepresentation."166 The court indicated that its holding might be different "if there were evidence that Pfizer had 'tacitly or overtly agreed' with the other defendants to continue selling its product without warnings or had been a party to 'written agreements, meetings, and other communications among asbestos defendants to conceal their knowledge of the dangers of asbestos from the public,'"167 However, as to that, the court found "no such evidence."168 In other words, the holding in Pfizer might have been different if it had been shown the trade association possessed unlawful goals, that is, engaged in fraud, and that Pfizer joined it to further those objectives. Similarly, a corporation or individual funding a front group engaged in fraudulent climate change denial would not be able to avail itself of a right-of-association defense once the government proved it supported that group to further the group's objectives and those objectives were "unlawful." 161.

The First Amendment does not require "a blanket exemption from fraud liability" for a defendant who intentionally misleads the public.169 In Madigan v. Telemarketing Associates, the Illinois Supreme Court had upheld dismissal of a claim for fraud brought by the Illinois Attorney General against two for-profit telemarketing firms raising funds for a Vietnam veterans' charity, 85 percent of which they retained as fees. Though not required to disclose their fees under Supreme Court precedent, the telemarketers made affirmative misrepresentations in stating that "a significant amount of each dollar donated would be paid over to [the veterans organization]," and that "the funds donated would go to further . . . charitable purposes."170 On appeal, Justice Ginsberg writing for a unanimous Court held that mere failure to volunteer the fundraiser's fee was insufficient by itself to state a claim for fraud, but in order to ensure that the public is "positioned to make informed choices about their charitable giving" consistent with the First Amendment, "[s]tates may maintain fraud actions when fundraisers make false or misleading representations designed to deceive donors about how their donations will be used."171 The First Amendment protects erroneous statements, factual errors or honest misstatements of fact made by a newspaper about a public official in a libel suit.172 Yet untruthful speech is not protected just because it is "commercial" in nature, even though truthful commercial speech enjoys constitutional protection.173 Nor is "insulting, and even outrageous, speech" in public debate protected if that speech is duplicitous. The argument that an unfettered interchange of ideas is necessary in public discourse cuts both ways. Deception has no value under that formulation and, further, it acts to mute or distort the power of Judge Learned Hand's "multitude of tongues"174 to influence public policy. It is precisely because the public discussion of climate change is crucial to the future of the human race that honesty in that discussion is essential. There is no better illustration of this point than the influence of the deceptive public relations campaign on the current understanding of the general public concerning the basic findings of climate change, which, are primarily questions of scientific fact and not "opinion."175 Moreover, the guarantee of free speech does not apply to a deliberately false statement made "with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not"176 The Supreme Court has held that 169.

Nor can they assert an unconditional right to express "opinions" based on such incomplete knowledge. To merit First Amendment protection, good faith "opinion" cannot be disembodied from fact. The district court in Philip Morris held that a supposed good faith "opinion," even if genuinely held, is actionable as fraud if either: (a) there is no objectively reasonable basis for it, or (b) the speaker is aware of facts "tending to seriously undermine" the statement which are not disclosed.178 The court continued: Accordingly, even where a speaker may not be aware of undisclosed facts and issues an opinion in supposed good faith, the statement will provide grounds for fraud where it can be proved that there is no reasonable basis for the speaker's belief. Were this not the case, companies would be able to shield themselves from liability by keeping their spokespersons in the dark about facts that are inconsistent with their public statements.179 The stock-in-trade of climate change denialism is concealment: the selective use of limited data as well as discredited or baseless scientific claims to argue a pre-conceived position.180 Even if such assertions cannot be shown to have been made in bad faith, or even if it likewise cannot be shown that the denier was aware of undisclosed facts tending to undermine them, so long as it still can be proved that there is no objectively reasonable basis for the "opinion" expressed, the First Amendment affords the "opinion" no protection. Do corporations have an unfettered right to express themselves on matters of public policy? Certainly, they cannot do so fraudulently, but a convincing argument also may be made that nothing a corporation says is entirely 177. Gertz v.

In a perceptive and enlightening article provocatively titled Against Freedom of Commercial Expression, Professor Tamara Piety argues against expansion of existing First Amendment protections for corporate and commercial speech as having potentially "significant negative consequences for the public interest" in, among other things, "environmental policy."181 She argues that "for-profit entities are not appropriate rights holders under the First Amendment" since "it is inappropriate to treat artificial entities as if they were human beings."182 The corporate fiction and its corollary, the fictional corporate shareholder, she argues, are not only fictional, they are essentially single-focus entities created and protected by law for the sole purpose of financial gain.183 Just as the fictional, two-dimensional person in mathematics can only exist in an infinitesimally thin plane, corporate speech, whether "commercial" or "political" or concerning other matters of public policy, is inevitably and legally constrained to one narrow purpose, the maximization of profit.184 Corporate speech, Piety maintains, is therefore always "commercial,"185 and furthermore the doctrine protecting "commercial" speech, which is "of relatively recent vintage,"186 is founded primarily upon the grounds that the hearers—that is, the consuming public—are entitled to the information disseminated, rather than upon the rights of the speaking corporation to disseminate it.187 The commercial speech doctrine is considered to have originated with Virginia Pharmacy in 1976,188 in which the Supreme Court was asked to decide if the State of Virginia could prohibit pharmacists from advertising drug prices.189 The consumer advocates who brought the suit argued that, as listeners, they had a First Amendment right to that information, which the State sought to repress, a theory previously proposed by Professor Martin Redish in a 1971 article.190 Redish had argued that speech in aid of commerce was protected because such information "was critical to market function" and 181.

The Supreme Court adopted Redish's argument with regard to commercial speech whole in Virginia Pharmacy on the grounds that there is a First Amendment right to "receive information and ideas" and that freedom of speech "necessarily protects the right to receive."192 However, the Court found it necessary to add that the protections afforded by the First Amendment to commercial or any corporate speech do not extend to deceptive or misleading speech, holding that "[ujntruthful speech, commercial or otherwise, has never been protected for its own sake."193 Even if the speech is not "provably false," but only "deceptive or misleading," the Court held it can still be prohibited without running afoul of the First Amendment.194 Elaborating on this point in a footnote, the Court emphasized that commercial speech by its nature may be subject to an even more rigorous standard regarding truthfulness: [T]he greater objectivity and hardiness of commercial speech, may make it less necessary to tolerate inaccurate statements for fear of silencing the speaker. They may also make it appropriate to require that a commercial message appear in such a form, or include such additional information, warnings, and disclaimers, as are necessary to prevent its being deceptive,195 The Court reaffirmed in a subsequent case, Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission, that "commercial" speech is only protected if it is truthful)96 However, despite basing its defense of truthful corporate commercial speech on the right of the public to truthful information, in a separate line of cases addressing corporate political speech, the Supreme Court appears to have fallen into a kind of "pathetic fallacy,"197 premising the rights of corporations to fund political advertisements,198 make political contributions,199 and engage in "issue advertising"200 on the inherent rights of the corporate speaker to self 191.

This line of cases culminates in Citizens United v. FEC,201 where the Supreme Court overruled its prior 1990 Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce decision202 in which the Court, placing the emphasis on the public's right to unbiased information, had upheld a Michigan statute prohibiting independent political expenditures by corporations.203 The Court in Austin had recognized a new governmental interest in preventing "the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of [corporate] wealth . . . that have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's political ideas."204 The Supreme Court in its Citizens United reversal of Austin based its holding on the "proposition that the First Amendment bars regulatory distinctions based on a speaker's identity, including its 'identity' as a corporation."205 The Court's jurisprudence, therefore, appears to be "built on the notion of the corporation as a 'person'—a person with rights to freedom of expression equal to those of human beings."206 Yet Justice Stevens, writing for the dissent and joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, was deeply troubled by the majority's flesh blind, egalitarian approach: The conceit that corporations must be treated identically to natural persons in the political sphere is not only inaccurate but also inadequate to justify the Court's disposition of this case. ... In the context of election to public office, the distinction between corporate and human speakers is significant. Although they make enormous contributions to our society, corporations are not actually members of it. They cannot vote or run for office. Because they may be managed and controlled by nonresidents, their interests may conflict in fundamental respects with the interests of eligible voters. The financial resources, legal structure, and instrumental orientation of corporations raise legitimate concerns about their role in the electoral process. Our lawmakers have a compelling constitutional basis, if not also a democratic duty, to take measures designed to guard against the potentially deleterious effects of corporate spending in local and national races.207 Not only do corporations have disproportionate resources to amplify their speech in the public debate, their interests in many respects conflict with that of the human beings whose future they would chart. Corporations have no need for democracy, and may in some circumstances flourish in its absence; nor do they have a stake in purely national interests, being multi-national in outlook and practice.208 Transnational corporations have been described as "firms that have no intrinsic loyalty to any country," which operate "on a transnational 201.

Corporations are "not accountable to voters except through the mechanism of governmental control."210 And there are indeed legal constraints to corporate speech. As the Supreme Court emphasized in Virginia Pharmacy, commercial speech must above all be truthful. A company may only increase profits within "the limits of the law."211 Professor Piety quotes no less an authority than Milton Friedman on this question, emphasizing that while the profit motive is legitimately regarded as a corporate prime directive, it is not unconstrained by law. "There is one and only one social responsibility of business," Professor Friedman writes, "to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud."212 As long as climate change deniers can be shown to have engaged in fraud, that is, knowing and willful deception, the First Amendment affords them no protection. This leads to the second possible challenge: the need to show an individual defendant acted with the required mens rea—intent to defraud. 2. Fraudulent Intent To "defraud" under the law requires intent to defraud: the mens rea of the offense. Thus the First Circuit has set forth the elements of wire fraud as follows: "1) a scheme to defraud by means of false pretenses, 2) the defendant's knowing and willful participation in the scheme with the intent to defraud, and 3) the use of interstate wire communications in furtherance of the scheme."213 The D.C. Circuit has held that, because "actual fraud" is not an 209. William H. Rodgers, Jr. &amp; Anna T.

The terms "scheme" or "artifice" are not defined under the mail/wire fraud statute, and the courts have shown a historical reluctance to define either term "except in the broadest and most general terms."216 However, it is important to recognize that it is the scheme itself which is the basis of the offense, not the fraud. Therefore, fraud in the execution is not required, nor need the scheme succeed. So, for example, the D.C. Circuit has held that "[i]t is the scheme to defraud and not actual fraud that is required."217 Nor do victims of the scheme have to be identified by the prosecutor.218 More significantly, no actual loss to the victim is required.219 In fact, to the extent that the scheme involves deprivation of money, it is not even necessary that the United States allege the precise amount of money realized as a result of the scheme, since the scheme need not have succeeded at all.220 Furthermore, once the existence of a scheme is proved, it is not necessary to prove every allegation of the offense; it is only necessary to prove that the scheme to defraud existed.221 The government only need prove that the defendant 214.

To require the success of the scheme to defraud would be to criminalize only those schemes which target gullible victims, and excuse fraud leveled at those more likely to detect it.224 Therefore, "it makes no difference whether the persons the scheme is intended to defraud are gullible or skeptical, dull or bright."225 Even "monumental credulity" of a victim is no defense.226 Thus, it is no defense for climate change deniers to claim either that the public had the understanding to see through their scheme of deception or, in the alternative, that the deniers cannot be held responsible for the folly of an overly-gullible public. The Seventh Circuit has defined "intent to defraud" as "willful participation in [the] scheme with knowledge of its fraudulent nature and with intent that these illicit objectives be achieved."227 However, the requisite intent "may be inferred from the totality of the circumstances and need not be proven by direct evidence."228 "[A] person's state of mind is rarely susceptible of proof by direct evidence, so specific intent to defraud may be, and most often is, inferred from the totality of the circumstances, including indirect and circumstantial evidence."229 For example, knowledge may be imputed to individuals and organizations with the expertise and resources to, in effect, "know better."

Failure to disclose risks associated with climate change, including physical risk to infrastructure and other assets, risk of more stringent future governmental regulation, and both public and private litigation risk may subject corporate officers and directors to derivative suits for failure to adequately monitor such risks or for breach of fiduciary oversight responsibility.237 It is difficult to imagine that the CEO of a large energy company, with access to the best professional and scientific intelligence money can buy, could be wholly ignorant of the basics of peer-reviewed, mainstream climate science, considering his or her presumed credentials, education and fiduciary responsibilities. Adam Bryant, writing for The New York Times, reports that among the broader lessons learned from interviews with over seventy corporate leaders, successful CEOs share the common trait of "passionate curiosity" and "ask big-picture questions."238 These successful CEOs are "relentless" questioners, Bryant says, who are "not necessarily the smartest people in the room, but they are the best students— the letters [CEO] could just as easily stand for 'chief education officer.'"239 231.

Such people cannot be compared to the layperson who may be understandably bewildered about climate science in the face of a howling media echo of manufactured uncertainty. It would be difficult for these individuals to claim they are unaware of the very public relations campaign they are engaged in furthering.240 In addition, fraudulent intent may be inferred if it can be shown that a representation has been made with reckless indifference to its truth or falsity.241 For example, extravagant claims about a device for which financial backing was sought from investors was enough for the Ninth Circuit to infer fraudulent intent in United States v. Cusino.2A2 Thus climate change deniers could be found to have acted with fraudulent intent for failure to adequately confirm the truth or falsity of their pronouncements, or for espousing arguments which are spurious or have been discredited by mainstream climate scientists. Fraudulent intent may also be inferred from half-truths or the concealment of material facts.243 In Lustiger v. United States, Lustiger was convicted of mail fraud for misleading representations made in connection with a land-investment scheme.244 Lustiger's advertising materials, the court held, were "in some respects false and, apart from falsity were, when considered as a whole, fraudulently deceptive and misleading, exhibiting an intent and purpose to defraud."245 The court found that the fraud lay not so much in what Lustiger said, but in what he didn't say: the fraud lay in the omission of pertinent facts, not in their misrepresentation.246 The court held that "[i]f a scheme is devised with the intent to defraud ... the fact that there is no misrepresentation of a single existing fact is immaterial. It is only necessary to prove that it is a scheme reasonably calculated to deceive,"247 Therefore, even if representations made by climate change deniers are not false in and of themselves, failure to disclose material facts that might disprove or refute such contentions may be evidence of intent, indicating that the scheme 240.

For example, the main thrust of the Action Plan described above was, as the Plan itself states, to continually stress to the press, the public, and public officials the "uncertainties" in climate science. No mention was made of the need for balance in such representations. Conveying climate consensus was not a part of the denialist public relations campaign; in fact, the whole purpose of the campaign was to conceal the facts of climate change from the public. Could not a court, applying the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit in Lustiger, find that this emphasis on the uncertainties alone, concealing or omitting facts necessary to a full understanding of climate science, constituted "a scheme reasonably calculated to deceive"?248 Finally, fraudulent intent may simply be inferred from the injurious effects which would result if the scheme were carried out.249 The D.C. Circuit in United States v. Reid held that although the purpose of the scheme must be to injure the victim, that purpose "may be inferred when the scheme has such effect as a necessary result of carrying it out."250 Climate change deniers would have a difficult time attempting to refute that the purpose of their campaign of disinformation was to harm humanity, once a climate science consensus had formed that GHG emissions were contributing to global warming, since the whole purpose of their deception, as stated in the Plan, was to avoid governmental restrictions on those emissions. Nor, in this case, must such knowledge necessarily be imputed. For example, as has been shown above, the fossil fuel industry's own scientific advisers as early as 1996 were counseling that GHG emissions were contributing to global warming and posed a threat to humanity.251 Moreover, international efforts to produce a reputable summary of the state of climate science resulted in the creation of the IPCC in 1988 and issuance of its subsequent assessment reports. For a CEO of an energy company or a scientist regularly making public statements, accepting speaking engagements, and publishing articles on climate science to profess ignorance of the IPCC assessment reports, or to question the validity of their most basic, peer reviewed findings, stretches credulity past the breaking point. 3. Deprivation of Money or Property Another objection to establishing fraud in the climate change denial context arises from the necessity of proving that the scheme involved the intentional deprivation of money or property.

United States, the Court held that mail fraud does not encompass "schemes to defraud citizens of their intangible rights to honest and impartial government" and is "limited in scope to the protection of property rights."258 Just months after the McNally decision, the Court somewhat incongruously held in Carpenter v. United States that confidential business information, despite its intangible nature, is "property" protected by the mail and wire fraud statutes.259 Carpenter thus distinguishes intangible property rights, which may remain protected by the mail and wire fraud statutes, from intangible non property rights, which McNally left unprotected. Nevertheless, after the Supreme Court read protection of the intangible right to "honest services" out of the mail/wire fraud statute, Congress put it back in by passing 18 U.S.C. § 1346, effective November 18, 1988, which defined the term "scheme or artifice to defraud" as including a scheme or artifice to deprive another of "the intangible right of honest services."260 While this seemed for several decades to resolve the intangible rights question,261 in 252. See, e.g., Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 735 (1972) ("The alleged injury will be felt directly only by those who use Mineral King and Sequoia National Park, and for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area will be lessened by the highway and ski resort."). 253.

United States?62 the Supreme Court placed a significant limitation on the "honest services" amendment by narrowly construing it to "cover only bribery and kickback schemes."263 That decision, however, left Carpenter intact, leaving open the question of the scope of "intangible" property rights protected under the mail fraud and wire fraud statutes.264 In addressing this question in Skilling, the Supreme Court attempted to draw a distinction between property interests protected by the mail fraud statute and unprotected "intangible rights," such as the right to "honest services," based on a presumed "symmetry" between the harm suffered by the victim and the benefit to the defrauder in the first instance, contrasted with a lack of such symmetry in the latter.265 The Court held: "Unlike fraud in which the victim's loss of money or property supplied the defendant's gain, with one the mirror image of the other, see, e.g., United States v. Starr, 816 F.2d 94, 101 (CA2 1987), the honest-services theory targeted corruption that lacked similar symmetry."266 The Second Circuit in Starr had stated, "[w]hile a finding that defendants garnered some benefit from their scheme may be helpful to the jury to establish motive, it cannot be probative of fraudulent intent unless it results, or is contemplated to result, from a corresponding loss or injury to the victim of the fraud."267 Whether or not this principle would apply to intangible property as well as tangible property may be an open question, but it should be reemphasized that it is not necessary for the government to prove either that the fraudulent scheme was executed or that it succeeded.268 Furthermore, not only would the victims not have to be identified by name in an indictment,269 they would not need to have suffered any actual loss of a property interest as a result of the scheme.270 262.

The consumer was considered to have been defrauded by being induced to purchase a defective or dangerous product, from which the seller derived an unjust profit. In other words, the requisite reciprocity was assumed to be present in the commercial transaction itself.273 But does such a reciprocal relationship between the anticipated benefit to the defrauder and the victim's damages exist in relation to the harmful effects of global warming associated with GHG emissions? The sale of fossil fuels to the individual consumer—whereby each is defrauded to the extent of the transaction (that is, wrongfully induced to purchase a harmful or defective product)—may be sufficient to meet this element of proof. However, there is an obvious difference between the two scenarios. Consumers of tobacco products have been duped into purchasing a product that will have undisclosed negative health effects upon them as a direct result of their entirely voluntary, personal use of that product; whereas fossil fuel consumers are being deceived into continuing to purchase a product whose use is almost universal and whose impact is not felt until it combines with the effects of countless other consumer transactions. More important, this view does not reflect the true character and scope of the transaction at large: the vast and inordinate profits garnered by the fossil fuel industry through the use of fraud, set against the enormity of the ensuing harm to the environment. A more comprehensive and accurate analysis would be to regard the "victim" as society at large, since those who stand to profit from the continued emission of greenhouse gases enabled by the deception described above do so at the expense of the consuming public. Since the 1960s, environmentalists and policymakers have increasingly viewed environmental problems through an economic lens.274 Economist 271. United States v. Jordan, 626 F.2d 928, 931 (D.C.

This is reflective of Adam Smith's eighteenth-century theory of the "invisible hand," whereby each individual seeking "only his own gain" is "led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention."278 However, there are frequently social costs and/or benefits associated with the manufacture of goods or provision of services which are not accounted for in the economic models. Sometimes referred to as "externalities," these are societal costs or benefits that are not reflected in market transactions.279 Externalities have been defined as "[t]he costs and benefits which arise when the social or economic activities of one group of people have an impact on another, and when the first group fail to fully account for their impact."280 Negative externalities exact a social cost, while positive externalities are socially beneficial. Negative externalities lead to what is referred to as "market failure," whereby the free market fails to account for external costs imposed on society at large. Such costs are not reflected in the purchase price and therefore are (at least initially) paid by neither the producer nor the consumer, resulting in an inefficient allocation of resources.281 Environmental pollution is one such negative externality.282 A second cause of market failure lies in the failure to place a value on the inherent public good of resources accessible to all, which are either depleted through the process of manufacturing or despoiled through 275.

For example, California has been described as "arguably at the leading edge of externality policy," owing to the use of externality valuation in its electricity planning process.296 In Europe, the European Commission sponsored the ExternE computer program designed to estimate externalities associated with energy production.297 A 1998 assessment of global warming costs by ExternE [1998], based on environmental impacts estimated by the IPCC, range from 0.018 to 0.046 Euro/kg of C02, with a median of 0.029 Euro/kg.298 In the United States, a similar project has been 292.

Assuming a "business as usual" scenario, "global environmental costs are projected to reach US$28.6 trillion, equivalent to 18% of GDP in 2050."301 GHG emissions "and resulting climate change impacts" accounted for most of the total environmental externality costs, above, rising from 69 percent of all externality costs in 2008 to a projected 73 percent in 20 5 0.302 Global annual externality costs from GHG emissions were calculated at approximately $4.5 trillion in 2008, representing the present value (in 2008 dollars) of future climate change impacts from all GHG emissions during that year.303 Rising costs due to escalating GHG emissions under a "business as usual" scenario (that is, no meaningful reductions in rising GHG emissions due to regulation), combined with "mounting climate change impacts," are projected by the United Nations Environment Programme study to result in annual global externality costs of $21 trillion by 2050, 13 percent of global GDP.304 It should be apparent that, as with any real estate appraisal, there is no precise or uniform way to value such externalities, yet the fact that governments and private institutions, in particular the insurance industry,305 are seriously engaged in developing and refining economic models aimed at quantifying the costs of climate change due to GHG emissions is enough to indicate that attaching dollar values to environmental degradation is more than simply attempting to value the loss of the "intangible" aesthetic enjoyment and recreational benefits of a healthy, clean and sustainable environment, which are also social costs of pollution.

Those tangible property interests include real estate and improvements endangered by coastal flooding, loss of income associated with diminished tourism in areas negatively affected, crop failures due to drought, damage to infrastructure and private property from inland flooding and increasingly severe storms, as well as the considerable costs of avoidance or adaptation that places such as Tuvalu and the Cataret Islands in the South Pacific will incur to relocate their populations as sea levels rise, or that London may incur to build a new Thames Barrier.306 "Climate change," as Nicolas Stern, former chief economist of the World Bank, puts it, "is the greatest market failure the world has ever seen."307 Such costs do not lack the reciprocity required by the Supreme Court as a characteristic of mail fraud, wherein the gain to the deffauder is a "mirror image" of the victim's loss,308 since negative external or social costs of GHG emissions which are not captured in today's market transactions constitute debts chargeable either to the energy sector or the public at large, but not both. Where the former benefits by avoiding externality costs, the latter is harmed to an equal degree by being forced to absorb them. Debts or contingent obligations for reimbursement have been held "tangible" property under the mail fraud statute by the federal courts.309 As has been seen above, establishing the precise amount of social costs is unnecessary to show a deprivation of property under the mail/wire fraud statute.310 Furthermore, the victims need not have suffered any actual loss of a property interest at all, since the scheme to defraud need not have succeeded.311 All that is required, to prove a scheme to defraud a victim of tangible property, is that the scheme entailed an anticipated gain to the defrauder which "mirrors" the anticipated or foreseeable loss to the victim.312 Officers of denier energy companies cannot be presumed to be ignorant of the negative externality costs of their operations to be borne by the public at large, since their plan of deception amounts to nothing less than a scheme to conceal from the public the very knowledge that such costs exist. 306.

Conspiracy to Defraud the United States Generally, a conspiracy to defraud the United States under 18 U.S.C. § 371 encompasses any conduct which would "interfere with or obstruct one of its lawful governmental functions by deceit, craft or trickery, or at least by means that are dishonest."313 The government need not suffer any loss of money or property in order to establish the offense.314 Section 371, titled "Conspiracy to commit offense or to defraud United States" provides, in part, that: If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.315 Because the agreement may be either to commit a federal offense or to defraud the United States, § 371 criminalizes two types of agreements: (1) conspiracies to commit a specific offense against the United States (the "offense" clause), and (2) conspiracies to defraud the United States (the "defraud" clause).316 The "offense" clause is broad and reaches conspiracies to commit any offense specifically prohibited by other federal statutes. The "defraud" clause is more narrowly defined and prohibits conspiring to defraud the U.S. government.317 Under the "defraud" clause, the government must prove the victim of the fraud was the United States or an agency of the United States.318 Corporations as well as individuals may be held criminally liable under § 371.319 The principal purpose of the "defraud" clause is to protect the integrity of governmental operations from impairment or frustration through deceptive 313.

But is the statute broad enough to reach such behavior? Cases interpreting the "defraud" prong of § 371 rely heavily on two early Supreme Court cases, Haas v. Henkef28 and Hammerschmidt v. United States?29 These cases bear scrutiny, since they make clear that for over a century the scope of the "defraud" clause has been interpreted extremely broadly, prohibiting the use of deceit to obstruct or impair governmental functions and efficiency by, for example, leaking or falsifying governmental reports thus destroying their value as "fair, impartial and reasonably accurate."330 In Haas, the defendant was charged with conspiring to induce a public official to give the co-conspirators advance information scheduled to be published in a Department of Agriculture report and with falsifying one such report, both for the purpose of speculation in the cotton market.331 Haas contended on appeal, inter alia, that the government's indictments failed to allege a conspiracy to defraud the United States, since the government had suffered no pecuniary loss.332 The Supreme Court held that "it is not essential that such a conspiracy shall contemplate a financial loss or that one shall result," since the statute "is broad enough in its terms to include any conspiracy for the purpose of impairing, obstructing or defeating the lawful function of any department of Government."333 Because, the Court continued, the gathering of statistics by the Department of Agriculture "is the exercise of a function within the purview of the Constitution, it must follow that any conspiracy which is 326.

It is not necessary that the Government shall be subjected to property or pecuniary loss by the fraud, but only that its legitimate official action and purpose shall be defeated by misrepresentation, chicane or the overreaching of those charged with carrying out the governmental intention.337 Therefore, under Hammerschmidt, deceit, dishonesty, misrepresentation, chicanery, trickery, or even "craft" in the scheme is enough to establish the defrauding element of the statute.338 Without parsing the dictionary definitions of these words, it is apparent from their use that a wide range of deceptive practices would be encompassed within the prohibited conduct of the statute. Subsequent cases have upheld this broad interpretation, such that § 371 now encompasses conduct which is not criminal under a separate statute,339 nor is § 371 limited by either the common-law or statutory mail/wire fraud definition of "defraud."340 All that need be shown is that the co-conspirators agreed to interfere with or obstruct a lawful governmental function "by deceit, craft or trickery, or at least by means that are dishonest."341 Outright lies would surely be included in this broad formula, but so too would the overall scheme of disinformation, including omissions, previously described.

Agreement to Defraud the United States The "agreement" itself is the first element and the "gist" of the crime of conspiracy to defraud.345 That is because entering into the agreement is the crime: the Supreme Court has held that "a conspiracy may exist and be punished whether or not the substantive crime ensues, for the conspiracy is a distinct evil, dangerous to the public, and so punishable in itself."346 Therefore, although the statute requires an "overt act" in furtherance of the conspiracy, the agreement to commit an unlawful act is punishable in and of itself and the ultimate success of the purpose of the agreement is irrelevant.347 There need not be an express or formal agreement; a tacit understanding is sufficient.348 For an agreement to exist, it is not necessary that it be in writing, or even expressly stated, nor need it spell out all the details of its execution.349 Nor need the government prove that all the conspirators participated in every 342.

As we have seen, the purpose of the Action Plan is to promote climate science "uncertainties" until '"climate change' becomes a non-issue" and "there are no further initiatives to thwart the threat of climate change."370 Given the urgency and necessity of governmental action to address climate change based on the consensus of climate scientists since at least the early 1990s, the assertion that climate science does not support governmental action to curb GHG emissions—the mantra of climate change deniers which has been factually untrue for several decades—371 is profoundly deceptive. It may not be difficult to establish that that those entities which saw fit to fund the actions of TASSC, the GCC, ICE, and the GCSCT, including execution of the Action Plan, shared the goals and aspirations of those "front groups," providing evidence of a "unity of purpose" or "common design" to obscure and distort the facts of climate science in representations made to federal officials in order to forestall governmental efforts to address climate change.372 Even without the Plan, such a common purpose could be inferred from the concerted actions of climate deniers themselves. An "agreement" can be inferred from the totality of the circumstances, including actions and statements of the conspirators.373 Second, the principle purpose of the Plan was ultimately to thwart or impede governmental information gathering and policymaking in order to prevent or forestall curbs on greenhouse gas emissions for as long as possible. The Supreme Court in Haas held that any conspiracy calculated to "obstruct or impair" the efficiency of a governmental agency by destroying "the value of its operations and reports as fair, impartial and reasonably accurate," would be to defraud the United States.374 As part of their strategy, climate deniers appeared before Congressional committees with responsibility for funding climate research, engaged in lobbying activities, made ad hominem attacks on government scientists, and belittled government initiatives to address climate 369. See Haas v. Henkel, 216 U.S. 462, 479 (1910); United States v. Hopkins, 916 F.2d 207, 212 (5 th Cir. 1990). 370. Action Plan, supra note 101, at 3. 371.

Whether they claimed anthropogenic global warming was not happening, or that it was happening but would be inconsequential, or that the costs of addressing it would be greater than its ultimate impact, the conclusion has always been the same: climate science does not support reductions in fossil fuel emissions.376 The Plan itself is not just directed at the public but also outlines a sophisticated lobbying strategy aimed at government officials. The Plan calls for establishment of a "Global Climate Science Data Center" (GCSDC), to be "established in Washington" to "inject credible science and scientific accountability into the global climate debate, thereby raising questions about and undercutting the 'prevailing scientific wisdom.'"377 The GCSDC, states the Plan, is to be staffed "initially with professionals on loan from various companies and associations with a major interest in the climate issue," with "knowledge and experience in," among other things, "Congressional relations and knowledge of where individual Senators stand on the climate issue."378 The GCSDC was to "become a one-stop resource on climate science for members of Congress, the media, industry and all others concerned" and "a sound scientific alternative to the IPCC."379 Through a "National Direct Outreach and Education" initiative, the Plan calls for "a direct outreach program to inform and educate members of Congress, state officials, industry leadership, and school teachers/students about uncertainties in climate science."380 The Plan continues: This strategy will enable Congress, state officials and industry leaders [to] be able to raise such serious questions about the Kyoto treaty's scientific underpinnings that American policy-makers not only will refuse to endorse it, they will seek to prevent progress toward implementation at the Buenos Aires meeting in November or through other ways.381 Tactics included conducting "science briefings for Congress, governors, state legislators, and industry leaders," and developing "information kits on climate science targeted specifically at the needs of government officials and industry leaders ... to further disseminate information on climate science uncertainties and thereby arm these influential [sic] to raise questions on the science issue."382 375.

Id. at 5-6 (emphasis added).</page><page sequence="57">2012] DECEITFUL TONGUES 887 In a particularly ominous provision, the Plan implies that the purpose of direct outreach to teachers/students is to embed contrarian uncertainty in the collective mind of the general public in order to "erect a barrier" against all future governmental efforts to address climate change.383 To accomplish this, the GCSDC was to include a "Science Education Task Group" to "serve as the point of outreach to the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) and other influential science education organizations," and to "[distribute educational materials directly to schools and through grassroots organizations of climate science partners (companies, organizations that participate in this effort)."384 This attempt at molding children's minds to "erect a barrier" against all future climate change regulation is reminiscent of Nazi anti-Semitic propaganda directed at children, of which there was a considerable amount in Hitler's Germany.385 In Congressional hearings held in 1996, "contrarian" witnesses were instrumental in convincing House Science Committee members to cut funding for NASA's "Mission to Planet Earth" by $400 million and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's program researching the effects of warming on ocean ecosystems by one-third, and to entirely defund EPA's global monitoring program to assess the impact of climate change on vulnerable ecosystems.386 Yet government funding of climate research is critical for our understanding of the climate crisis and how to deal with it. This was stated succinctly by William Ruckelshaus, first Administrator of the EPA: If the critical questions about climate change involve gaining a better understanding of what impacts to expect and what rate of change we might see, then the government must be the entity funding the research. At this point, we urgently need much more research on the nature of the problem. Unfortunately, to the extent that industry funds scientists, it does so to 383.

It is clear the government has to take the lead by providing the research.387 Ruckelshaus's argument appears to rest on the importance of the research, as well as the necessity for a disinterested source of funding to avoid conflict of interest. Yet Ross Gelbspan in The Heat is On identifies another reason: the assurance of scientific rigor and integrity which government sponsorship provides.388 Gelbspan explains: Government-funded science provides an assurance of integrity. Conducted according to the exacting standards of professional academic research, it is the arena where truth has the greatest chance, however small, of being revealed. To compromise the standards of scientific research would be to open the door to a direct assault on society's most highly developed body of knowledge.389 And yet in 1996, based largely on testimony by climate deniers, the government essentially turned its back on climate research. Although the 1980s had seen large increases in global environmental research funding by the federal government, in 1996 "Congress turned that tradition of bipartisan support for science on its head."390 These and other actions may be evidence of an "agreement" to "obstruct or impair" the efficiency of the United States government by representing to government officials, in one form or another, that climate science does not support governmental action to regulate GHG emissions. Federal prosecutors could argue that such actions had the purpose of destroying the value of governmental "operations and reports as fair, impartial and reasonably accurate."391 2. Knowing and Voluntary Participation Although the Action Plan and other actions of the front groups funded by the fossil fuel industry and friends may provide evidence of the existence of a conspiracy or "agreement" to defraud the government, a particular defendant, either a corporation or individual, must still be shown to have voluntarily participated in the conspiracy.

Ferreting out the participation of all these individuals and organizations in the conspiracy and establishing their various roles would be a daunting task. However, the government is not obligated to name all the co-conspirators, nor prove each conspirator was aware of all the actions of the other co-conspirators or participated in all aspects of the conspiracy.393 A defendant may join a conspiracy without knowing all its details or members. The Supreme Court has held that: Secrecy and concealment are essential features of successful conspiracy. The more completely they are achieved, the more successful the crime. Hence the law rightly gives room for allowing the conviction of those discovered upon showing sufficiently the essential nature of the plan and their connections with it, without requiring evidence of knowledge of all its details or of the participation of others. Otherwise the difficulties, not only of discovery, but of certainty in proof and of correlating proof with pleading would become insuperable, and conspirators would go free by their very ingenuity.394 Thus, the government would have the advantage of being able to select only those who played the most prominent or egregious roles in the conspiracy for prosecution.395 However, even if a defendant only agreed to play a minor role in the conspiracy, to establish membership the government need only prove that the defendant understood the overall purpose or essential nature of the conspiracy and intentionally joined in it.396 Since the essence of the conspiracy was to convince government officials of something that was not true—that climate science, lacking consensus, did not support governmental action to mitigate GHG emissions—direct statements to that effect by individuals, corporations and other organizations through corporate websites, press releases, distribution of "educational" materials, and States v.

Even a "slight connection" to the conspiracy is sufficient to establish membership.397 And direct evidence may not be necessary: "all the elements of a conspiracy charge, including intent and knowledge of illicit purpose, 'may be proven entirely by circumstantial evidence.'"398 Knowledge of the conspiracy may be inferred from the defendant's own acts and statements.399 Further, the Supreme Court has held that "[participation in a criminal conspiracy need not be proved by direct evidence; a common purpose and plan may be inferred from a 'development and a collocation of circumstances.'"400 Thus, corporate funding of a trade organization, think tank, or other front group which in its public statements revealed it was dedicated to defeating all governmental action to address climate change through regulation of GHG emissions by representing to government officials that climate science was "uncertain," could be evidence that the CEO of the funding corporation or the corporation itself "knew" of the conspiracy to spread "uncertainty" and took positive and knowing steps to join it. Defenses to allegations of "participation" in a conspiracy may include freedom of association protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution, because "association alone will not support a conviction for conspiracy."401 Therefore, "[mjere association with conspirators, knowledge of a conspiracy, and presence during conspiratorial discussions are not sufficient proof."402 For liability to be imposed "by reason of association alone ... it is necessary to establish that the group itself possessed unlawful goals and that the individual held a specific intent to further those illegal aims."403 A defendant with ties to a front or "grassroots" group advocating inaction on climate change might claim that the prosecution was improperly attempting to link that defendant to the larger conspiracy based on mere association with the group alone. The government would counter, however, that evidence, direct or indirect, that the defendant intended to join the group with the purpose of accomplishing its objectives overcomes this objection, as long as it could also be shown that the group itself, by participating in the conspiracy, had "unlawful goals."404 Funding of such a group, for example, might constitute "indirect" evidence that a defendant intended to further the group's unlawful goals. 397.

The energy industry cannot continue with "business as usual" indefinitely owing to the inevitable depletion of fossil fuels in another century or so.414 In the interim, the increasing scarcity of oil, gas, and coal reserves will drive the industry to adopt more extreme measures to extract them, running increasingly costly environmental risks in doing so. And the longer we wait, the higher the costs will be to humankind, since in addition to costs of mitigation those costs will also include the significant and escalating costs of climate change adaptation. Yet there are some who, for profit, would recklessly gamble with the future of humanity and the Earth. As a strong global consensus began to emerge in the 1990s among climate scientists that anthropogenic global warming posed a grave threat to humankind, some in the fossil fuel industry began an extensive public relations campaign to keep that knowledge from the public and governmental officials. This campaign has been highly successful. Conservative politicians in the United States today are almost united in opposition both to domestic GHG regulation and international cooperation in reducing GHG worldwide. Thus, not only has the U.S. government failed to respond to the crisis, but the ability of the United States to provide international leadership on climate change has been severely eroded. The denial campaign is designed for one purpose alone: to deceive. Its purpose is to prevent government regulation of CO2 emissions by creating out of whole cloth a monumental illusion: that a controversy exists among climatologists about the basic facts, as well as the climate implications, of global warming. To create the impression in the public mind of such a controversy, the denial campaign deliberately set out to create a vast artificial edifice, a Hollywood set of false facades and roads leading nowhere complete with lab-coated actors mouthing carefully tested and scripted messages.

It is fundamentally deceptive in purpose, conception and execution. Yet, one may say, though this plan of deception may be morally repugnant, why focus on criminality when other legal means may be available through government regulation or in tort to curb GHG emissions? The answer to this question is that freedom of speech—both individual and corporate—and the reverence with which it is regarded in our society notwithstanding, we cannot allow fraudulent or deceptive speech to paralyze the public debate on a subject no less important than the survival of the human species and the future of the Earth itself. We punish fraud with a vengeance in the myriad and ingenious ways it manifests itself in such mundane matters as payment of taxes, banking and other financial transactions, consumer advertising, internet malfeasance, applications for licenses, and other contractual undertakings. And fraud is a broadly defined crime, encompassing not just the outright lie, but deception, misrepresentation, concealment, factual omissions and other "badges" or indications of fraud, any of which may be evidence of both the scheme to defraud itself and the defrauder's criminal intent. One may well wonder why this essential weapon of the prosecutor's arsenal, thought to be vitally necessary to protect all our financial, cultural and governmental institutions from deceit in both small and large matters, is ineffective to prevent a massive deception pressed upon the general public of such scope and effect as to endanger the future of humankind itself Furthermore, establishing liability under criminal fraud statutes can serve as a basis for civil claims, such as the RJCO action in Philip Morris, through which the government or private parties may seek court-ordered relief to enjoin or sanction further fraudulent activity by the corporations and individuals concerned.415 Anthropogenic climate change may be the greatest trial humankind has faced in all its brief, 200-millenium sojourn on this planet.416 Yet we must not forget that it is our science, only relatively recently developed, that has brought us both prosperity and crisis: unprecedented wealth and comfort, but at a grievous cost—unprecedented harm to our fragile environment.417 We cannot expect to profit so from science but discard it when it becomes inconvenient, when it counsels frugality in the avoidance of catastrophic harm. Science remains our best survival tool. And yet there are those who would discard that tool by taking us into a new dark age, who urge upon us an illusion of greater and greater affluence through unrestrained exploitation of the Earth's resources, while attempting to hide from us the devastating environmental consequences 415.
