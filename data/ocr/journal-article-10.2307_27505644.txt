The positive role of religion in the mental health of black Americans is a much neglected theme in the literature. This paper considers "religion" as one of the important retained black cultural traits, which continues to play a vital, role in the mental health and survival strategies of black Americans. The paper examines Grier and Cobbs's appraisal of the religion-mental health connection in black communities and identifies different ways for mental health practitioners to think about religious phenomena and the primal partnership between religion and mental health. The paper concludes with a challenge to keep awareness of the religion-mental health partnership together in the treatment of black Americans. Significant contributions to the field of reUgion and mental health already exist.1 Yet when viewing the Uterature on reUgion and mental health, one is struck by the dearth of empirical and conceptual work that deals specificaUy with the reUgion and mental health of black people. The positive role of reUgion in the self-esteem and mental health of black Americans is a much neglected theme in the mental health literature. Modern-day healers committed to the development of modern science have tended to repress awareness of the essentiaUy reUgious dimension impUed in the healing ritual of therapy. The essentiaUy reUgious impulse and reUgious nature of the human person may be positively recognized as a constitutive dimension in mental health. To ignore the reUgious nature of human beings while seeking to restore them to psychic health would not only trivialize a vital mental health resource in the black experience; it would further aUenate black people from awareness of the creative and spiritual depths in which their humanity participates and upon which their total weU-being ultimately depends. ReUgious values play an important role in the way black people order their Uves at the most concrete levels of their existence. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the relationship between black reUgion and mental health and to offer some concepts that wiU help clergy, the laity, and mental health workers to regain a sense of common ground.2 ReUgion is discussed as an important cultural trait among black Americans, which continues to manifest itself in various ways as a resource vital to their self-esteem and mental health. Archie Smith, Jr., M.S.W., Ph.D., is Professor of Religion and Society at the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley, California. This paper was originally presented at a two-day conference on "Some Dynamics and Psychotherapeutic Methods in Rendering Treatment to Blacks," March 15 and 16, 1980, in Oakland, California. This particular paper discussed religion as one of the important retained black cultural traits. 0022-4197/81/160OO264$00.95 264 ? 1981 Institutes of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="2">Archie Smith, Jr. 265 This paper was prepared for a conference entitled Some Dynamics and Psychotherapeutic Methods in Rendering Treatment to Blacks. The organizers of the conference are to be congratulated for including a section on religion and mental health. These two seemingly autonomous disciplines, as sources of addressing, diagnosing, and healing within the human condition were never separated in the world view of archaic and traditional African cultures. Nor were they separate in that invisible institution called slave religion in the Western Hemisphere. In traditional African cultures sacred time and profane time were not differentiated. For them the world was unified, a sacred cosmos or web in which the individual's well-being was inseparably linked to that of others. An old Zulu proverb best captures the place of the individual in his or her world: "A person is thus, because of other persons." He or she is there because there are other people with him, before him, and after him.8 In a similar way questions of illness and health, religious ritual, and medicine were joined in a common enterprise, because they were perceived as participating in a reality that transcends them. A most pious Hassidic rabbi once said: Supposing some one comes to you and asks your help. You shall not turn him off with pious words, saying, "Have faith and take your troubles to God." You shall act as though there were no God; as though there was only one person in all the world who could help this man?only yourself!4 It is instructive that this apparently sacrilegious assertion comes from a religious person, a rabbi. He could make this assertion because of his belief in the unity of the world and the partnership between God and people. His plea was that people, particularly the culturally designated helpers, uphold their end of that partnership.5 This rabbi's religious-ethical view was not far from the world view found in traditional African religions. The chief difference between the man of the archaic and traditional societies and the man of the modern societies with their strong imprint of Judaeo-Christianity lies in the fact that the former feels himself indissolubly connected with the cosmos and the cosmic rhythms, whereas the latter insists that he is connected only with history. Of course, for the man of the archaic societies, the cosmos too has a "history," if only because it is the creation of the gods and is held to have been organized by supernatural beings or mythical heroes. But his "history" of the cosmos and of ?uman society is a "sacred history" preserved and transmitted through myths.6 In our contemporary urban environments religion and mental health are often seen as autonomous, unrelated, if not competing and conflicting systems of activities. Each system, with its own philosophical understandings of the nature of the person, tends to mistrust the claims of the other. Hence, some religionists view psychiatry, for example, as a modern-day heresy or idolatrous faith that has trivialized the spiritual (or cosmic) dimension in the name of mental health. Religionists have often viewed the practice of psychiatry as destructive to religious belief. They have argued that psychiatry has replaced</page><page sequence="3">266 Journal of Religion and Health God with man (species term) as the subject of ultimate concern. Accordingly, the human person is himself or herself taken to be the persisting source of value and meaning. Everything else is perceived as relative to this. Psychiatry has often returned the compliment by viewing reUgion as a symptom of mental ?lness. Psychiatry has tended to equate reUgion with sick reUgion and to view aU reUgious phenomena from that perspective. Yet the concerns of both psychiatry and reUgion can be put in a genuinely reciprocal relationship for the enrichment of both where awareness of their interdependence exists. OriginaUy, the concerns for spiritual and psychic health were united in a single role, that of a priest, root man, medicine man, or shaman. Today that linkage is rare. Dialogue between the two disciplines tends to be one-sided, with psychiatry assuming a superior position to reUgion. Yet there is Uttle real room for arrogance. The research Uterature does not support the be?ef that psychotherapy administered by trained psychiatrists and psychologists is superior to psychotherapy administered by untrained laypersons. "Several researchers have investigated this thesis, and their results have shocked their coUeagues. Several studies show that untrained laymen do as weU as psychiatrists or clinical psychologists."7 Success in psychotherapy may be related to factors other than the educational background of the therapist. Psychotherapy for the poor, uneducated, and black populations has not been readily available, nor has it been very helpful when available. Among the majority of black Americans, belonging to and participating in their own church communions may prove to be more supportive of their mental health than psychotherapy. Indigenous churches need to be recognized even more as a mental health resource. Black churches need to be recognized by mental health workers as mediating structures Unking the private sphere of the individual to the pubUc sphere of the wider society, and they need to be recognized as therapeutic communities more likely than mental health agencies to meet the emotional needs of belonging and more likely than state-funded programs to be supportive of the mental health of the people. These factors suggest the greater need for mutual understanding among reUgionists and mental health workers. Arrogance on the part of either of these partners is not likely to be supportive of mental health in the short or long run. Yet the problem of a superior-inferior relationship persists. "Psychiatrists and psychologists," argues Martin Gross, "condescendingly point out the differences between modern psycho therapy and primitive healing. But the similarities are. .. striking. . . ."8 Gross continues, "Modern psychotherapy. . .is the bastard progeny of a long tradition of neo-reUgious and magical practices."9 The possession by a hex,10 for example, is perceived to be a form of mental disease (rather than a sign of spiritual disfavor). In many instances, even the clergy have turned to psychiatry for an answer when such problems surfaced in their congregations. Yet psychiatrists, as a rule, are not trained to address this problem in reUgious or theological terms. It is more likely to be diagnosed as a psychiatric problem. This has not always been the case, however. In ancient Judea, the priestly L?vites were the medical healers as weU, purging illness through divine inspiration. In early Christianity, sickness was stiU a religious matter.</page><page sequence="4">Archie Smith, Jr. 267 One needed to share the Christian beliefs to partake of the healing power. The miracles of Lourdes, the evangelistic faith healer, the voodoo spiritualist all draw on the assumption that the healer and the patient are clued in to a special set of ideas. The successful modern therapist.. . imitates the faith healer. He absorbs the therapist's myth: belief in a particular psychotherapy. "The therapist's beliefs regarding his efficiency as a curing agent generally derive from his training in and adoption of a particular school of psychotherapy," says Dr. Calestro.11 Until recently, the church alone dealt with problems of demon possession and troubles of personality. But today the psychiatrist functions as the secular high priest of modern culture. Psychotherapy is perceived as a key ritual for exorcising the demons of our time. "In this ritual, the impressionable patient's hope and faith are coupled with the healer's belief in his own magical powers.... It is industrial society's sophisticated imitation of the witch doctor's primitive healing technique."12 In contemporary urban environments religion, rather than being the dimension of depth or mystery13 permeating all of life, is more and more relegated to the periphery or assigned to the private sphere.14 It is difficult, in a secular milieu, to appreciate the hidden depths of religious concerns in mental health issues or to appreciate the mental health questions in religion. In traditional African societies this segregation of the life of the person was not a problem, because issues of mental well-being were never separated from the spiritual well-being of Africans. The unity of both was guaranteed within a structure and philosophy of life common to all the people. But in our day the union of these issues is difficult to see. The therapist who brings both clinical skill and an openness to the religious quest for meaning to his or her practice is rare. Generally, our training as mental health practitioners has not prepared us to be competent theologically and clinically. Yet there has always been in black communities someone who combined the functions of the priest and medicine man or woman in a single role. The separation of these two areas is a more recent phenomenon in our history, a function of the impact of specialization, professionalism, technological advance, and the knowledge explosion in an ethos that is increasingly secularized. We might ask an ontological question: Can black people be healed?if their gods are silenced? And can they ever be free if their religion serves only to pacify and inhibit their rage and moral outcry? We must remember that religion has always played a strong and important role in the survival of black Americans. Robert B. Hill identified the religious orientation of black families as a strength in black family life. Their religious orientation has enabled them to survive throughout their history in America.16 Azubike Felix Uzoka argued that traditional family network values, primordial feelings of attachments, and emotional ties to the past continue to function effectively in modern family life. Hence, recognition of these factors is necessary for an adequate grasp of the symbolic relatedness of current family dynamics and effective therapeutic intervention.16 Today both religion and mental health are challenged with a common concern to cast out debilitating myths of family functioning, to exorcise the demons of self contempt and emancipate the inner self for life in community, and to heal and care for the souls of black people.</page><page sequence="5">268 Journal of Religion and Health The central question, I beUeve, is this: Can black reUgion and mental health be put in reciprocal relationship for their mutual enrichment; can they be put in a reciprocal relationship in the interest of the emancipation struggles of black people; and can they be put in reciprocal relationship to benefit the human condition in general? I use the term black religion because it has many strains, and no single formulation is Ukely to explain aU the possible connections between its radical reUgious expressions and its radical poUtical ones.17 Black reUgion has been intrinsic to the black struggle for Uberation, and it is inseparable from black culture as a whole. Black reUgion has permeated the music, Uterature, and poUtics of black people. It has been impUcit in social radicaUsm, concepts of black power and black nationaUsm, and it has found expression in the store-front cults of urban centers as weU as in estabUshed denominations such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church and black Baptist denominations. The uniqueness of black reUgion is the racial bond that seeks to risk its Ufe for the elusive but ultimate goals of freedom and equality by means of protest and action.18 Black reUgion, then, goes far beyond "reUgious" gatherings and churches. It finds expression in the culture of the streets, as well as in more traditionaUy recognized "reUgious" places. Black reUgion, whatever symbols it gives rise to, expresses the primal sense of belonging to something ultimate, an eternal source of meaning and value. Black reUgion is a continuation of African reUgions, which originate in a profound beUef in the origin of things?a beUef in a primordial reaUty. This primal sense of belonging is deep within the human soul. St. Augustine, the black bishop from Hippo, expressed it this way: "Our souls are restless until they find their rest in Thee." Rosa Parks, the twentieth-century civil rights leader, expressed it: "My feets are tired, but my sotd is rested." WilUam Grier and Price Cobbs have shown reUgion to be detrimental to the mental health of black people. They have helped to identify an important dimension of the reUgion-mental health relationship in black communities. But there may be some Umitations in their approach. The Grier^Cobbs model of religion: the Jesus bag In 1971 WilUam Grier and Price Cobbs, two black psychiatrists, gave us a model of reUgion?from a mental health perspective. I shall sketch the essence of their model of reUgion, as found in their second book, The Jesus Bag.19 They portray "reUgion" as a "protective psychological device" incapable of correctly diagnosing the larger system of oppression which engulfs black people. For the majority of black people reUgion has resulted in self-defeating inhibitions. According to Grier and Cobbs, reUgion has served to guarantee the passive, nonviolent, law-abiding stance of blacks in the face of cruel oppression. They argued, "ReUgion has done Uttle to proclaim injustice where it flourishes and less to combat it."20 Hence, reUgion has functioned to adjust blacks to their oppression rather than to serve as a means for transforming it. It has been a part of an insidious form of racism, because it has erdisted the</page><page sequence="6">Archie Smith, Jr. 269 victim's cooperation in his or her own oppression. Religion has taken root in the inner forum of consciousness and has taught some piously oriented black people to distrust their innate survival instincts and to adjust to their deprivation. Hence, religion counsels passivity and adjustment, and it constitutes the main support in the denial of reality. Grier and Cobbs further argued, "Religion, of such deep emotional importance and sustenance to so many blacks for hundreds of years, is now seen by more and more of us as hypocritical and capable of only the feeblest moral leadership, and even that, in its own interest and on its own terms."21 While religion has in the past served as a technique of survival for black people, it may now have outlived its usefulness. Religion is a deadly device of inner control diverting attention from the reality demands of the present world, and it has directed attention to a world beyond. Church-oriented, otherworldly religion imposed by white slave masters and accepted by blacks has revealed itself to be a self-defeating psychological device inhibiting the mental health and liberation struggles of black people. Grier and Cobbs saw the essence of the controlling, self-defeating effects of religion when they wrote: "Not even the bloody slave revolt in 1831 led by Bible reading Nat Turner could change the use to which religion was now put. The slave had been converted to a religion of death-row."22 They conclude that religion "gave little spiritual sustenance for life on earth"23 and served to mask expressions of deep hurt and rage. In short, religion has been the mechanism par excellence to damage black people psychologically and has served to incarcerate them in a world of self-contempt and inner rage, by misdirecting their attention and energies to a world beyond. The Grier-Cobbs alternative As an alternative to their fatalistic model of religion, Grier and Cobbs posit an alternative they call "a healing black morality." They see this alternative model as being new, psychologically profound, and illustrating certain hard psychological truths. They do not develop what is meant by "certain psychological truths," nor do they show that their model is "new." In their alternative model they advocate an uncritical acceptance of the "present-day" world as the real world. Here the realities surrounding black life are to be acknowledged as "dangerous and unpredictable." Blacks must adapt themselves to this fact. Blacks must "pretend that life is orderly and meaningful and at the same time respond to its disorder and its meaninglessness."24 In this alternative model blacks must mistrust religion and speak in human terms?that is, of people, not religion?and of their capacity for greatness. In their alternative model, blacks must become wounded healers, sharing their bread with their neighbors, not killing or stealing, and sowing the deeply ingrained seeds of brotherhood and sisterhood throughout society. Grier and Cobbs argue that this new vision "has much less to do with Christianity than Christians think. It is rather the creative</page><page sequence="7">270 Journal of Religion and Health response of a tortured, driven people."25 Based on this alternative humanistic model, they expect to "find a body of ethical standards which," they admit, "are desperately needed."26 But whether this body of ethical standards can come from science without the aid of reUgion or from psychiatry alone they do not say. A number of observations are in order at this point. Grier and Cobbs raise for us important questions about the relation between reUgion and mental health in black or ethnic minority communities. This relationship is always conditioned by social, economic, and political realities in the wider society and world. The relation between reUgion and mental health must be judged by the ways in which it fosters a comprehensive view of life, emancipates humans to act responsibly toward themselves and others, and addresses the deeper questions of human meaning. Grier and Cobbs are not alone in their evaluation of religion. It was Karl Marx who said that if we are to understand society, we must begin with a critique of reUgion. And it was Durkheim who stated that reUgion points to what men take as the sacred in society. The sacred, and symbols of the sacred, are those rea?ties that serve as the clue to radical social change. It is out of an understanding of the sacred that ethical principles are built. Grier and Cobbs's position of fataUstic reUgion finds support from black social scientists in the positivist tradition that rejects reUgion as "regressive." They also find support from those who advocate a more strident, miUtant, Marxist posture toward fundamental social change and who see "reUgion" as based upon a deficit, or as an "opiate to miUtancy."27 This position finds support from other secular humanists who reject the essential premise upon which a distinctly reUgious world view rests, and also from black youth who have rejected church-oriented religion, although some of the latter may not have rejected the broader impUcations of black reUgion. Hence, I do not see Grier and Cobbs as being straw men, but, rather, as spokespersons who have accepted, perhaps too uncriticaUy, a thoroughly secular view of reaUty and who have ignored an essentially reUgious concern in their protest against reUgion. Their definition of reUgion describes a sick form of reUgion that evades the issue of a deeper and more adequate spiritual search for meaning and wholeness. By their own activity of questioning and rejecting they affirm that man is a self-questioner, a self-transcending being in search of deeper answers to the questions his situation evokes. But they fail to address the metaphysical assertion impUed in their search. Unwittingly, they may have replaced a sick psychology of religion with a reUgion of psychology. In this Ught we make four observations: 1. The model of reUgion as portrayed by Grier and Cobbs is founded upon a narrowly pathological view that they equate with slave reUgion and church oriented reUgion. It is indisputable that under certain conditions reUgion functions in ways that support individual pathology and inhibit social protest. But reUgious beUefs may also inspire protest movements, as evidenced by the slave revolts in the Virgin Islands in the 1790s, the bloody Nat Turner raids in 1831, the civil rights movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries,</page><page sequence="8">Archie Smith, Jr. 271 and the black power movements of the 1960s. Religious beliefs have contributed toward a restructuring of social values and have resulted in healthier images of what it means to be human and black. Historian William C. Suttles, Jr., observed that religious practices took on new meaning in the new world: Here, religious authority was in many instances "aggressive and imperialistic"; as Maya Deren has written, such practices as voudoun and conjuring "met new world needs that the settled and passive African modes could not match." The appearance of such modes in the Americas marks the revenge of the slave's intellect upon a hostile world. ... As a number of studies make clear, these modes were occult, that is, "radical" in the contect of authority. And this is a clue to the sometimes violent, political implications of the slave's religious life.28 2. Grier and Cobbs raised the question: Can a healthy black self-concept based upon the Imago Dei emerge apart from religious imagination? Religious imagination implies the human capacity to step beyond ourselves, our time, and our history, while enmeshed in them, and to envision alternative futures. "Imagination is the distinctively human quality by which meaning is discovered and declared, alternative perceptions and meanings are envisioned, and human freedom is affirmed through the imagination of any number of possible futures."29 If religion is premised upon a narrow and truncated grasp of reality, will this not contribute to limited understandings of human possibilities and aspirations? The term reality here is taken to mean an extremely complex phenomenon. It includes the past, present, and future anticipation of a people. It also includes the concepts of mystery and transcendence as parts of the human condition. The human person here is understood as a being who lives in more than one dimension. The person stands in the present, comes out of a past, and yet transcends the present toward a future, an open horizon. Black religion in its healthier expressions has inspired the human spirit toward greater heights and achievements than were predicted by the logic of the present world. To quote again from Suttles: The ideological cause of rebellion was often rooted in the slave's radical religion. It was the radical religious perspective of the slave that provided the stylization, the sort of insistency that led to revolutionary protests in new world slave societies. The character of slavery in the Americas qualified slaves to a radical, religious view of themselves. ... It was in this day to day situation that obsessed men channeled their deepest needs into some kind of unorthodox religion. Slaves revived or tried to revive the old African observances. Under the amused or unknowing eye of plantation authority, they bound themselves in discipline to rites that called for their attention at every turn of work and rest. These modes were not always "other-worldly" or compensatory: voudoun and conjuring did not simply rule over the slaves' violence and waste it in trances. . .. Typical in this regard is the advice of a Jamaican deity in 1820 telling the slaves "they were free and they would not work any more." This too is a kind of "defense mechanism," but it is only the beginning, a preface to active, violent rebellion. For now, through the medium of his religion, the</page><page sequence="9">272 Journal of Religion and Health slaved "colonized" self (his slave mentaUty) was disassociated, and the slave willfully strove to destroy the material and human trappings of the plantation authority around him.30 3. Grier and Cobbs's alternative model is not new. It has its roots in the soil of human history and the history of reUgions?including the reUgions of Africa. We cannot underestimate the black psyche, nor can we know fuUy its contents nor limit what it is capable of producing. One could argue that what Grier and Cobbs have advocated as new is fundamentaUy reUgious. 4. Grier and Cobbs have not only raised the question of the relation between reUgion and mental health; they have also posited the crucial question, "What is reUgion?" Let us consider this question, "What is reUgion?" In their view reUgion is a self-defeating psychological device and something that human beings can dispose of. In their view reUgion is extraneous, nonessential to the nature of black people. The contention of this paper is that black people are fundamentally religious human beings, conscious of participating in time and in a transcendent reality. Therefore, "reUgion" is not something that humans possess Uke a piece of property. "ReUgion" is a constituent dimension in black selfhood. In order to take black people and their mental health seriously, we must take their fundamental nature seriously within a historical context. They are Umited and conditioned by culture and historical circumstances and yet are somehow free to reflect upon these particularities and forge new scenarios, and to be aware of what they are doing. In discussing "reUgion" we are simultaneously discussing ways in which we see ourselves, our world and ultimate reaUty, and our relation to these. My contention, then, presupposes a discussion of the reUgious nature of black people as a basis for discussing their mental health. We may learn that efforts which seek to divorce the reUgious dimension from mental health concerns, or to divorce the mental health dimension from reUgion's concerns, are doomed to result in partial, if not inadequate, versions of what it means to be black, healthy, and human. We may also come to appreciate that what may be considered "healthy" reUgion in one epoch may be "unhealthy" reUgion in another. Joseph Fabry, for example, has pointed out, "A medieval man, beUeving that the earth was flat and that he UteraUy would burn eternaUy for his sins, was mentally healthy. He would not be considered healthy today."31 Black reUgion, if it is healthy, will acquire different functions for different periods. The underlying themes have to do with forgiveness, emancipation, reconcihation or affirmation, and the quest for ultimate meaning. ReUgion has always been fundamental to the understanding and interpretation of black experience. What we want to know is how reUgion manifests itself in black experience, and how it has empowered a disenfranchised people to hold themselves and their world together. What we may come to see is that reUgion has been an indispensable part of black people's self-affirmation, emancipatory struggles, and quest for ultimate meaning.</page><page sequence="10">Archie Smith, Jr. 273 Perspective on religion It is difficult to arrive at a definition of religion that will meet with a consensus. Its roots are many and deep; yet each definition captures a certain truth about the phenomenon. The difficulty with definitions of religion centers in the need to find a definition that encompasses the bulk of religious phenomena. There are many understandings of the world and of life that are not structured in the more popular categories that make distinctions between the natural and supernatural. Some understandings of religion do not necessitate a belief in a supernatural being. Other understandings of religion may necessitate a belief in a god, many gods, or a supernatural being. A further difficulty with definitions of religion is found in what Martin Buber referred to as the eclipse of transcendence. In a secular milieu such as ours, new understandings of our world, of Ufe, and history are emerging without the traditional religious symbols to guide an interpretation of experiences once associated with "religious experience." What I propose is to identify four perspectives or approaches to religion. Several perspectives can be identified, including phenomenological, psychological, and theological perspectives. Each perspective attempts to state something about the nature of the human person, his or her place in the scheme of things, and something about the person's relation to the world and ultimate reality. These perspectives are necessarily broad and require us to think from several different angles if we are to appreciate the variety of religious phenomena with which mental health workers and clergy are confronted. Hence, awareness of a number of approaches may enable us to identify similarities and differences within a common ground. The anthropological perspective on religion. This perspective affirms the most elementary concept of religion as the capacity of the human organism to transcend its biological nature and establish a world in common with other people. Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann have articulated this position.32 Their main contribution has been to provide an interpretation of religion that finds acceptance among social scientists?as social scientists. It is not an interpretation that theologians or the clergy can accept with ease. But it does provide a basis for understanding the anthropological condition for religion. The underlying assumption in this perspective is that the individual is born into a pre-existing society already interpreted by his or her predecessors.33 Although the individual enters society at a particular time of its development, he or she must achieve an identity and a consciousness within it as a member of society, as one who holds membership within a particular gender, ethnic group, and social class. In order to achieve ?n identity, the human organism must transcend his or her biological nature and become a social being. According to this perspective, religion is rooted in the individual human potential to transcend its biological nature and to construct a symbolic universe, a system of meaning that enables</page><page sequence="11">274 Journal of Religion and Health him or her to make sense out of the everyday world, on the one hand, and to project beyond it on the other hand. Central to this model of reUgion are three ideas that Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann called three dialectical steps or moments.34 They are: (1) Externalization, which is rooted in the biological constitution of the human organism, and refers to continuous activity itself. The human organism cannot help but express itself in the natural and social world in which it exists. The understanding here is that the individual is empiricaUy an externalizing, responding, creating, building being. (2) Objectification is the second moment or step in this dialectic, and it refers to the products or creations that result from human activity. Such objectifications may be a result of economic activity, poUtical activity, or reUgious activity, which result in economic, political, and religious institutions. Objectifications tend toward institutionaUzation. They become rea?ties in their own right, independent of their original producers, and confront them as objective fact. (3) Internalization, the third step in this dialectic, refers to the different and unique ways in which individuals reappropriate the objective world and make it a constituent element in personaUty. Psychotherapy and psychoanalysis are particularly concerned with this third step, especiaUy with internalized oppression and distress patterns created by racism. In this anthropological perspective humankind does not have a fixed relation to the world. Rather, the person is in a world, and yet the person must also make a world. The human being must continuaUy estabUsh and reestabUsh a relationship with the world and with his or her own body. Through this activity, the person not only contributes to new configurations, but also creates and locates a self, a personaUty, an identity, and a destiny within the social world. Every social world consists of accumulative processes and residual historical forces more powerful than the efforts of any single human being. It is within the social world as a totaUty that individuals come to develop their subjective orientations. No one InternaUzes the world or human history as a totaUty. Rather, individuals develop a perspective on the world derived from historical contributions, their own past, their unique interactions and locations within the present, and future anticipations. ReUgion, within this approach, is understood as a human and historical enterprise that estabUshes a sacred orientation within the world. To the reUgious mind, the world as presently constituted is inherently precarious, supported by human activity, and yet threatened by human interest. The reUgious mind and reUgious tradition apprehend the empiricaUy tenuous character of the world and relate it to a sacred cosmos, an ultimate rea?ty. Sacred here impUes an assigned meaning to the awesome power and influence of society past and present which Ues beyond the control of any single individual or group. To the reUgious mind, the sacred is apprehended as "standing-out from the ordinary," and confronting the person as an immensely powerful reaUty other than the self, yet intimately connected with the self. This reaUty is apprehended as an encompassing sacred rea?ty that is ultimately significant.</page><page sequence="12">Archie Smith, Jr. 275 In this approach, religion is rooted in human activity, in the human capacity to transcend the experiences of everyday life through the creation of a symbolic universe, a world of symbols and interpretive schemes, which enables one to live beyond the world as given, while remaining in the world of everyday experience. Here the primary function of religion is to bestow meaning and give one an ultimate point of reference for comprehending the human condition. The implication is that religion has its origins in human activity alone. This approach does not necessitate a leap beyond the human or finite realm. Meaning, in other words, can be found in humanistic terms. Religion, in this approach, is derived from the objective and subjective reality of human beings who produce and reproduce meaning in their own lives within a particular society and historical epoch.35 In this light a religious phenomenon is often conveyed as a dichotomy between profane and sacred, ordinary and extraordinary, between chaos and order. To be in a "right" relationship with the sacred is to be on friendly terms with and to seek protection from the unpredictable and from the chaos that threatens human existence. "To fall out of such a 'right' relationship is to be abandoned on the edge of the abyss of meaninglessness."36 Viewed historically, most of humankind's worlds have been sacred worlds. Human beings have always sought ways to make friends with and domesticate the sacred powers. From this perspective, mental health is sought in attempts to transcend immediate time by placing the world and the self within a larger frame of meaning and purpose. "This permits the individual... to exist in the world. . .in the more extreme marginal situations. . .in the knowledge that even these events or experiences have a place within a universe that makes sense."37 The unique feature of religion, from this perspective, is its capacity to locate human phenomena within a cosmic frame of reference. In this approach, religion is the audacious attempt on the part of humans to locate a center of meaning and give significance to their lives by recognizing an encompassing reality more powerful than any single person or group. It can thus be said that religion has played a strategic part in the human enterprise of world-building. Religion implies the farthest reach of man's self-externalization of his infusion of reality with his own meanings. Religion implies that human order is projected into the totality of being. Put differently, religion is the audacious attempt to conceive of the entire universe as being humanly significant.38 I alluded earlier to the fact that Grier and Cobbs, in their protest against religion, posit an alternative way to find meaning. Their approach demonstrated concern for the unhealthy, self-defeating ways in which religion is often internalized. But in their protest against religion they imply the possibility of stepping back (externalfeation) and confronting (objectification) and possibly transforming the social-political order. These three moments are implied in their own activity as therapists and in the living process in general. In reality, these three dialectical moments are interrelated. They may become recognizable moments in therapy, as the therapist, with the client, attempts to</page><page sequence="13">276 Journal of Religion and Health objectify the painful situation in order to make decisions and effect inner changes through the activity of therapy itself. Therapy here is understood as a social or joint activity in which two or more persons or a network of symboUc relations are involved. This interpretation comes very close to supporting the idea of therapy as a secularized form of reUgious transformation without the traditionaUy acknowledged rituals of confession, descent into hell, dark night of the soul, death, absolution, and the emancipated self rising to new Ufe. That psychotherapy is a modern faith-heaUng art is increasingly apparent. The primitive faith healer, like the modern psychotherapist, creates an aura of sacredness and beUef. Again like the psychotherapist, the would-be shaman goes through an initiatory rite which grants him status and special powers of omnipotence and omniscience. His patients hold him in awe and share his assumptions about the affliction.39 This first perspective identified reUgion with man's capacity to create. The second and third perspectives wiU be concerned with reUgion as a personal activity having a philosophy, orientation, or comprehensive attitude toward Ufe. They are less concerned with identifying the anthropomorphic conditions of reUgion. Rather, the second and third perspectives wiU identify reUgion with particular subjective experiences. We shaU refer to subjective or personal reUgion as accommodative and then as transformative. The vast majority of the Uterature on reUgion centers around the second, third, and, as we shaU see, fourth perspectives. The first approach to interpreting reUgious phenomena is more recent and relatively new. The accommodative perspective on religion. The accommodative approach refers to reUgion as beUefs and practices that function to adjust the individual to his or her environment. This approach accepts the world as it is, wh?e it seeks to emphasize the positive aspects of a situation as a way to order Ufe, overcome conflict, and conquer cynicism and despair. WilUam James was a pioneer in helping to identify this approach to reUgion. In this account "reUgion" is a coUective name for the feeUngs, acts, and experiences of individuals in their aloneness and in their awareness of standing in the world before a primal reaUty, the divine. The relation of the self to the world and the divine is central. The value of personal reUgion is to be discerned by its fruits, the way in which it works in personal Ufe. "It gives him a new sphere of power. When the outward battle is lost, and the outer world disowns him, it redeems and vivifies an interior world which otherwise would be an empty waste."40 Martin Luther King, Jr., in a personal communication once wrote: It seemed that aU of my fears had come down on me at once. I had reached the saturation point.... In this state of exhaustion, when my courage had almost gone, I determined to take my problem to God. My head in my hands, I bowed over the kitchen table and prayed aloud. The words I spoke to God that midnight are stiU vivid in my memory. "I am here taking a stand for what I beUeve is right. But now I am afraid. The people are looking to me for leadership, and if I stand before them without strength and courage, they too</page><page sequence="14">Archie Smith, Jr. 277 will falter. I am at the end of my powers. I have nothing left. I've come to the point where I can't face it alone." At that moment I experienced the presence of the Divine as I had never before experienced him. It seemed as though I could hear the quiet assurance of an inner voice, saying, "Stand-up for righteousness, stand-up for truth." "God will be at your side forever." My uncertainty disappeared. I was ready to face anything. The outer situation remained the same, but God had given me inner calm.41 William James argued, "If religion is to mean anything definite for us, it seems to me that we ought to take it as meaning this added dimension of emotion. ... It ought to mean nothing short of this new reach of freedom for us."42 James identified religious feelings with "happiness." Religious happiness is not a form of escape from evil or life's hardships. Religious happiness is an inner victory or triumph over the objective conditions of evil. "It cares no longer to escape. It consents to the evil outwardly as a form of sacrifice?inwardly it knows it to be permanently overcome."43 The accommodative approach is a way of looking at the human condition. It is a way of conceiving things as fundamentally and universally good. Evil, in a pure and absolute form, is deliberately ruled out. Accommodative religion has a way of looking at a bad situation or experience and assigning a moral or divine purpose to it, so that the evil or destructive aspect is positively expunged. Belief in evil as the last word or final authority in the natural world is abandoned. Evil is not believed in. When the passion is extreme, suffering may actually be gloried in, provided it be for the ideal cause, death may lose its sting, the grave its victory. In these states, the ordinary contrast of good and evil seems to be swallowed up in a higher denomination, an omnipotent excitement which engulfs the evil, and which the human being welcomes as the crowning experience of his life. This, he says is truly to live, and I exalt in the heroic opportunity and venture.44 Accommodative religion emphasizes the side of human nature that calls out the conquering efficacy of courage, hope, and trust, and a correlative contempt for doubt, fear, and worry.45 The transformative perspective on religion. By contrast, the transformative perspective on religion takes the opposite view of the world. This approach is based upon an absolute disenchantment with the status quo or ordinary life. Evil and suffering are perceived as yielding the central truths about the human condition in its natural state. The disenchantment with the natural state of things is expressed by the philosopher in the book of Ecclesiastes I: These are the words of the Philosopher, David's son, who was king in Jerusalem. It is useless, useless, said the Philosopher. Life is useless, all useless. You spend your life working, laboring, and what do you have to show for it? Generations come and generations go, but the world stays just the same. The sun still rises and it still goes down, going wearily back to where it must start all over again. The wind blows south, the wind blows north?round and round and back again. Every</page><page sequence="15">278 Journal of Religion and Health river flows into the sea, but the sea is not yet fuU. The water returns to where the rivers began, and starts all over again. Everything leads to weariness?a weariness too great for words. Our eyes can never see enough to be satisfied; our ears can never hear enough. What has happened before wiU happen again. What has been done before wiU be done again. There is nothing new in the whole world. "Look," they say, "here is something new!" But no, it has aU happened before, long before we were born. No one remembers what has happened in the past, and no one in days to come wiU remember what happens between now and then. I, the Philosopher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. I determined that I would examine and study all the things that are done in this world. God has laid a miserable fate upon us. I have seen everything done in this world, and I teU you, it is aU useless. It is like chasing the wind. You can't straighten out what is crooked; you can't count things that aren't there. I told myself, "I have become a great man, far wiser than anyone who ruled Jerusalem before me. I know what wisdom and knowledge reaUy are." I was determined to learn the difference between knowledge and fooUshness, wisdom and madness. But I found out that / might as well be chasing the wind. The wiser you are, the more worries you have; the more you know, the more it hurts.46 What is required by the sufferer in this kind of cosmos is a second birth, a total reversal of self-contempt and despair that can only come from a supernatural source. This kind of reUgion requires a leap out of history. Evil is curable, in principle at least. A supernatural remedy is required to correct the inner malady and to transform the sickness of the world soul. To the transformative reUgious orientation, the accommodative perspective seems unspeakably bUnd and shaUow. It tends to cry, "Peace, peace when there is no peace." To the accommodative orientation, the transformative seems to have sided with the disease and underestimated the capacity of the human soul to triumph over the forces of evil in personal and social Ufe. But the orientation of the accommodative model breaks down when pathological depression and despair set in. "There is no doubt that [the accommodative model of reUgion] is inadequate as a philosophical doctrine, because the evil facts which it refuses positively to account for are a genuine portion of reaUty; and they may after aU be the best key to Ufe's significance, and possibly the only openers of our eyes to the deepest levels of truth."47 Life confronts aU of its children with both evil and good. The evil facts of Ufe are just as genuine as the good ones. Accommodative reUgion fails to take seriously the depth and pervasive nature of evil, pain, sorrow in personal and coUective Ufe. A more comprehensive reUgious orientation would face evil and pessimism as real forces in Ufe and seek the triumph of the power of goodness over evil in the world. A reUgious system that stresses de?verance or emancipation while facing the exigencies of everyday Ufe has been a strong theme in the reUgious experience of black people. But theism, a beUef in a supreme being, God or Allah, or the cosmic Christ, has traditionaUy been the central theme in black and African reUgions.</page><page sequence="16">Archie Smith, Jr. 279 Theistic perspective on religion At the heart of this religious orientation is an experience with and belief in the numinous?a divine being, an ultimate reality that transcends or eludes comprehension in rational or ethical terms.4* The numinous is a wholly other reality sometimes referred to as God, Yahweh, Elohem, Allah, or by some other name that sets its objective existence apart from any human product. This orientation to religion is at the opposite end of the continuum from the anthropomorphic approach to religion. The point is that this objective reality is not merely a constituent dimension of being human or merely a subjective feeling or idea in the mind. Rather, it is something "there." The numinous is a living presence, a divine transcendent otherness taken to be the creator and the creative and sustaining power of everything that exists. No one term, culture, or tradition can capture its fullness. That is why mystics refer to it as "the mysterious overplus surpassing all that can be clearly understood and appraised."49 This religious orientation is emphatically asserted against any anthropocentric tendency to scale it down or reduce its significance to measurements that meet the test of human reason. The central idea is that there is a personal force, a tremendous mystery and presence, a sustaining power that is the ultimate ground of all existence. Awareness of this sustaining presence is personal and firsthand. It is not a product of human thought. It cannot be reduced or made equivalent to human creations such as society, culture, or finite reality. It has a relation to finitude, but it is not itself a finite reality. Human beings can know this reality through divine self-disclosure and as an inner event. As an inner event it is posited as a primary immediate datum of consciousness. The numinous may evoke feelings of creaturehood, of something uncanny, eerie, weird, awesome, or feelings of terror, exaltation, unspeakable joy. Different cultures in various ways and in different periods of history have pointed to an encounter with such a wholly other reality. If we were to place these different approaches on a continuum, they would look like this: Anthropomorphic Accommodative Transformative Theistic Perspective Perspective Perspective Perspective These perspectives overlap. For example, one may be a theist and be basically accommodative in outlook. Or one may be a theist and transformative in outlook. I cite Dr. King again as illustrating an essentially accommodative theistic attitude (although Dr. King can also be placed in the transformative model). Above all, we must be reminded anew that God is at work in his universe... he is not outside the world looking on with a sort of cold indifference. Here on all the roads of life, he is striving in our striving. Like an ever-loving Father, he is working through</page><page sequence="17">280 Journal of Religion and Health history for the salvation of his children. As we struggle to defeat the forces of evil, the God of the universe struggles with us. Evil dies on the seashore, not merely because of man's struggle against it, but because of God's power to defeat it.50 It is possible to interpret this quotation in ways that show accommodative trusting that God is working in and through the circumstances of history. Therefore, beUevers must side with God's activity by loving their enemies and by doing good to them that use us out of spite. Hence, awareness of God's presence is salvation and the basis for hope. An example of a transformative theistic religious orientation is found in an utterance of Malcolm X: I do not now, and I did not then, liken mysetf to Paul. But I do understand his experience. I have since learned?helping me to understand what then began to happen within me?that the truth can be quickly received, or received at aU, only by the sinner who knows and admits that he is guilty of having sinned much. Stated another way: only guilt admitted accepts truth. The Bible again: The one people whom Jesus could not help were the Pharisees; they didn't feel they needed any help. The very enormity of my previous Ufe's guilt prepared me to accept the truth.61 "Only guilt admitted accepts truth." There is something the beUever can and must do in order for divine help to be efficacious. The self-agency of the person is an important factor in salvation. It would be interesting to relate these various approaches, reUgious beUef systems, and value commitments to types of social structures, systems of action, and personality development. Such an attempt would have relevance for mental health workers who would seek to understand the influences that contribute toward healthy or mature reUgion and those that contribute to sick reUgion. But that task is weU beyond the scope of this paper.62 Our concern is at a more general level, that is, to see reUgion as an important cultural trait and a resource vital to the mental health of black Americans. I have sketched these various positions because they serve as a basis for mental health workers to think about the variety of emerging reUgious orientations in contemporary black communities. Mental health workers are often confronted with reUgious materials from their cUents; such information may not be understood as expressed "reUgious" concerns, but rather as manifestations of a deep-seated pathological condition impervious to psychological intervention. A mental health worker once told me that she stopped visiting an elderly black woman because each time the elderly woman wanted to talk about Jesus. The mental health worker wanted to do something about the elderly person's mental condition, but it did not occur to her that perhaps Jesus talk was the clue that the elderly woman offered for her mental improvement. J. Herman Blake, in his research in an isolated rural community, found that "good health" among the elderly is defined in reUgious terms. Illness and health are viewed in terms of one's relationship to the divine. Illness is viewed as the visitation of divine disfavor, and good health is viewed as being a sign of divine favor. In these terms medical intervention is</page><page sequence="18">Archie Smith, Jr. 281 perceived as interfering with the divine will and the spiritual quest for wholeness. Illness is a matter to be worked out between the sufferer and God.53 The essentially spiritual quest is generally seen within psychoanalytic thought as foreign to psychological health, not concomitant with it. The trend in our culture has been to reduce human meanings to the boundaries of scientific rationalism and to trivialize the essentially religious impulse that has been so important in the self-concept of black people historically. We must ask: Can the human person be sound if his or her mental health is divorced from the religious quest for wholeness? And can the religious quest be a healthy one if the person is psychically unstable?54 Religious maturity is a significant factor in psychic stability. Both are profoundly influenced by the individual's degree of relatedness to cultural networks and heritage. All three?religious maturity, psychic stability, and cultural integration?form a vital balance. It is my contention that the divorce of religious and mental health was not the dominant theme in the experience of African slaves in the Western Hemisphere. Indeed, religion, the quest for ultimate meaning, permeated all areas of human life to the extent that it shaped the cultures and social life of African peoples. In turn the African way of life shaped religion as well. The great divorce is a product of an age that has undermined the foundations on which a traditional world view rested, and it has tended to trivialize the spiritual quest for ultimate meaning. Nevertheless, a religious quest continues to be effectively present in modern culture, even though traditional religious language is not used. Modern secularized culture has contributed to a view that looks pejoratively upon religious talk and the religions of our forebears. A pejorative outlook has limited our understanding of a resource that sustained them under conditions that denied their essential humanity and oppressed them brutally. Paul Radin, in his forward to God Struck Me Dead, argued: It has always been an extremely strange fact that, both during the days of slavery and during the first decade after the war, so few individuals escaped complete demoralization and so few developed neuroses. In the days of slavery, an adaptation to the external world in which slaves lived was blocked completely except on a very superficial level. Only in an inner world could the Negroes develop a scale of values and fixed points of vantage from which to judge the world around them and themselves.65 They had developed, in spite of their objective situation, inner resources, which Genovese called "weapons of defense." The questions we want to pursue, then, are these: Was it their proximity to the African experience, a kind of remembering of the gods of Africa that kept them alive in a living hope? And do those same gods continue to live on in the psyche and social networks of black people today, sending down new shoots and bearing new fruits? Do these gods make a difference when we think about the self-image and mental health of black people today? The religious orientation of African slaves was preeminently theistic, as an examination of slave narratives and sorrow songs will show. The idea of God</page><page sequence="19">282 Journal of Religion and Health as Supreme Being was not new to African slaves. God, the supreme being, was the most fundamental idea about reaUty. The notion of God as the supreme being was prominent in aU African societies. Knowledge of God was expressed in proverbs, songs, prayers, stories, and reUgious ceremonies. The supreme being was omniscient, almighty, transcendent, uncreated, self-dependent, and unchanging. The supreme being was also spirit, eternal, personal, and beyond human comprehension.56 So it is not that European missionaries introduced an idea of a supreme, aU-powerful, and aU-knowing deity to Africa. God was already in Africa prior to the influence of Christianity, Judaism, or Islam. African soil germinated its own original reUgious perceptions. God [was] no stranger to African peoples, and in traditional Ufe there are no atheists. This is summarized in an Ashanti proverb that "no one shows a child the Supreme Being." That means that everybody knows of God's existence almost by instinct, and even children know Him.67 This is not to say that there was one reUgion that embraced all of Africa. The point is that the idea of a supreme being was found in aU African societies. The particular forms this idea took were and continue to be influenced by historical, geographical, social, and cultural background or environment. The Divinity expressed its power in many ways and through many m?dianes and lesser gods, in and through the social network of the family and clan. Hence, there were many reUgions, reUgious be?efs, customs, and cultic experiences, each with its pantheons and rituals. Illness and death were beUeved to emanate from many sources?social, natural, and spiritual. In order to diagnose and cure the cause of illness, the priest-diviner, witch doctor, or shaman was often necessary. In other instances the beUever was able to speak directly with the gods and derive the benefits of their benevolence.68 ReUgion was central to the Africans' self-understanding and philosophy. For them the world was permeated by a Uving presence, a supreme being. ReUgion permeated the Ufe of the people. To paraphrase St. Paul, in their reUgion they Uved, moved, and had their being (Acts 17:28). The orientation of the African was, above aU, Ufe-affirming. And this outlook came with our forebears to the new world.69 "This world-view found expression in the spirituals, music, dance, and general Ufe-style of latter generations who came to be known as Afro Americans."60 ReUgion touched on every aspect of Ufe. It was the underlying, unifying factor. Historian Albert Raboteau argued in Slave Religion that despite almost four centuries in the Atlantic slave trade and attempts to eradicate all forms of African culture, African reUgious be?efs and customs persisted and were transmitted by slaves to their descendants. Raboteau writes: Influenced by colonial European and indigenous native American cultures, aspects of the African heritage have contributed in greater or lesser degree, to the formation of various Afro-American cultures in the New World. One of the most durable and adaptable constituents of the slave's culture, linking African past with American present, was his reUgion.</page><page sequence="20">Archie Smith, Jr. 283 The fact is that they [Africanisms] have continued to develop as living traditions putting down new roots in new soil, bearing new fruits as unique hybrids of American origin. African styles of worship, forms of ritual, systems of belief, and fundamental perspectives have remained vital on this side of the Atlantic, not because they were preserved in a "pure" orthodoxy but because they were transformed. Adaptability, based upon respect for spiritual power wherever it originated, accounted for the openness of African religions to syncretism with other religious traditions and for the continuity of a distinctively African religious consciousness. At least in some areas of the Americas, the gods of Africa continued to live?in exile.61 This presentation has suggested that the strongest African retentions, if they are to be found today in black America, may appear in traditional black folk-church religion, sects, cults, music, and dancing?especially in those areas where blacks have been in a substantial numerical majority, and where their culture has been somewhat protected from the dominance of white influence.62 It has been their religion (black religion) that has sustained black people, given them a body of ethical standards and the inner strength to withstand the attacks upon their public, private, and collective selves. The counter-thesis suggests that all Africanisms were eliminated during the slave trade and slavery, that the religion of Afro-Americans began again on American soil, introduced by white Christianity, as the guiding moral framework for black people. Within this counter-thesis, the self-image of black people is inherently tied to religious concepts that deny them and their culture any real significance. Within this thesis Africanisms and black folk religion are not seen as sources for enriching our understandings of Christianity, the human condition, or the meaning of being human. This counter-thesis, however, is being challenged by more recent research on the black family, black culture, and black religion.63 During the latter half of the 1960s and early 1970s the religion of black power emerged to address the evils of racism and economic exploitation. A part of the affirmation of black power is, "We are a spiritual people."64 The religion of black power emphasized self-love, an inner power that comes with self-esteem, as well as social transformation and nation-building. John Oliver Killens expressed the sentiments of the movement when he wrote: [Black Power] does not teach hatred; it teaches love. But it teaches us that love, like charity must begin at home; that it must begin with ourselves, our beautiful black selves.65 The liberation struggles of black people in the United States have included the need to be free from interior forces of enslavement as well as free from external forms of oppression. In this light both religion and mental health need to reaffirm the ancient partnership they had in the cure and care of souls. Historically black people have found in their religions the source of hope, vitality, and the courage to persevere in the face of great odds. Often they have called on family members, especially mothers and grandmothers,66 medicine men, their ministers, Yahweh, Jesus, Allah, or other gods of Africa to help them, because their mental and spiritual well-being depended upon it.</page><page sequence="21">284 Journal of Religion and Health Today, reUgion and mental health are chaUenged to find common cause again. Both are concerned with the inner Ufe of persons and their search for reUef and meaning; both are aware of the shaping power of beUefs, the need for enduring values; and both are aware of the human sense of destiny. Both are aware of the importance of love and trust as the basis for self-acceptance, esteem, growth, and integration. Basic trust, love, and acceptance are the greatest forces which conquer estrangement and self-negation.67 Psychotherapy and family therapy may help to shake free paralyzing guilt, help Uft depression, and enable family members to identify and change destructive patterns of interaction. Bagarozzi has argued that today's therapist should be aware of the possible influences on family processes of kinship and community groups. The clinician might find it advisable to view Black fam?y systems in terms of the social networks in which they exist, rather than as isolated nuclear famiUes which are more characteristic of the white middle class. Kinship groups also can be used by the therapist as support systems. For example, grandparents may be used as parental surrogates who can provide nurturance and acceptance for an abused or scapegoated child.68 Psychotherapy may also help to minimize infantile preconceptions in people brought up with reUgious ideas?enabUng them to cope rea?sticaUy with change and the day-to-day problems they face. ReUgionists are in a potentiaUy strategic position to advance mental health concerns because of their training in theology and philosophy. Their personal commitment and discipline enable them to nurture basic beUefs, values, and a hoUstic orientation toward Ufe.69 ReUgion, if it is healthy, can contribute to a mature understanding of unavoidable suffering or life's mysteries and to the confidence that human beings have intrinsic value. ReUgionists may have a special sk?l in identifying values, because of their theological and philosophical preparation. ReUgionists and mental health workers are entrusted with the cure and care of souls. Both are aware of the objective and subjective conditions that can repress, domesticate, and enslave human Ufe. Both can find common ground in emancipatory struggles that inspire and Uberate the imagination. Emancipatory struggle and the care and cure of souls do not faU completely to one or to the other. Both reUgion and mental health can assume complementary relationships and give critical perspective to the person or family seeking help in a troubled age. Both are chaUenged to help evaluate, diagnose, and transform the spiritual and moral malaise of our time. References 1. James, W.f Varieties of Religious Experience.

The author was particularly helped by Nachbahr's metaphysical understanding of religious experience and mystery as the inescapable, unexpressed, and incomprehensible dimension implied in all experience and knowledge. "The religious experience cannot be adequately defined, because it is man's relationship to the undefinable, to the mystery. Mystery is not just another name for God, but expresses our original and most radical experience of Him. . . . Another way of saying this is that the experience of the mystery is implied (as condition of possibility) in the experience of our selves (subject) and our world (object) as finite. . .. The infinite mystery, therefore, is not an object of our knowledge and choice in the same way as we can know and choose people and things. It is rather the non-objectifiable, ever present, yet ever receding, horizon that makes every knowledge and choice of objects possible; it is presupposed to every knowledge and choice of particular objects and values. It is the incomprehensible preceding every comprehension" (17-18). 14. See Luckmann, T., The Invisible Religion. London, The Macmillan Company, 1967; and Berger, P., The Sacred Canopy.

The reader is referred to the works of Talcott Parsons, who, in his treatment of religion and mental health, sought to articulate the relationships between personality structure and social structure.

The psychically unstable person may be described as one whose inner life is characterized by deep-seated insecurity which becomes manifested in interpersonal relationships. Guilt and a sense of unworthiness, withdrawal in the face of new challenges, anxiety about the future, confusion about life and personal identity, and unhappiness in intimate relationships are characteristic of the psychically unstable person. Such a person will have difficulty coping with the normal demands of everyday living, and will have difficulty establishing trusting relationships with others. The experience of self as insecure and unworthy will influence the religious quest. Grier and Cobbs indicated that persons who were already insecure and dependent tended to use religion as a protective and psychological device in ways that hinder growth. The error in their approach was to associate religious belief and experience exclusively with the defensive functions of the ego rather than locate religious orientation at</page><page sequence="24">Archie Smith, Jr. 287 the center of the emerging ego's experience. (See Allport, Becoming, op. cit, p. 96.) From a psychoanalytic perspective, the origins of deep-seated insecurity are found in childhood developmental experience. Object relations and relation to transitional objects in childhood experience are fundamental in the formation of values and religious commitment in later life. D.W. Winnicott's phrasing of this is helpful in "describing the developing human being: the infant and small child is usually cared for in a reliable way, and this being cared for well enough builds up in the infant to a belief in reliability; on to this a perception of the mother or father or grandmother or nurse can be added. To a child who has started life in this way the idea of goodness and of a reliable and personal parent or God can follow naturally." (In Winnicott, D.W., "Morals and Education (1963)." In The Maturational Processes and the Facilitating Environment New York, International Universities Press, Inc., 1955, p. 93.) Religious experience is ontogenetically rooted in childhood experiences. Childhood experiences are rooted in a social and cultural milieu which may or may not support and nurture psychic stability and foster mature religious values. 55.
