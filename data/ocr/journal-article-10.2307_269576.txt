B 3Y f PEI'EIR BURIAN Noted for her contradictory words and actions, Penelope has been a problematic character for critics of the Odyssey. In a fresh approach to the problem, Marylin Katz links Penelope closely with the strategies that govern the overall design of the narrative. By examining its apparent inconsistencies and its deferral of truth and closure, she shows how Penelope represents the indetermi- nacy that is characteristic of the narrative as a whole. "'Marylin Katz adds an original, exciting reading to the body of critical literature that has recendy revolutionized Homeric criticism as she assufes the risk and the pleasure of the intertextual challenge." -Pietro Pucci, Cornell University Cloth: $35.00 ISBN 0-691-06796-1 An extraordinary drama of flight and rescue arising from women's resistance to marriage, The Suppli- ants is surprising both for its exotic color and for its forceful enactment of the primal struggle between male and female, lust and terror, brutality and cunning. The Suppliants has no hero, downfall, or tragic conclusion. Instead the play portrays unre- solved conflicts of sexuality, love, and emotional maturity. These distinctly modern themes come alive in a new translation that re-creates the psychological immediacy as well as the dramatic tension of this ancient work.

R E A R D 0 N In this pioneering work E.J.W. Barber completely revises our notions of the origins and early development of textiles in Europe and the Near East. Using innovative linguistic techniques, along with methods from palaeobiology and other fields, Barber has pulled together an enormous amount of widely scattered data to reveal that spinning and pattern weaving began far earlier than has been supposed. Prehistoric Textiles also provides a lively and anecdotal description of the day-to-day life of families in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Central Europe, and the Aegean area. Over 200 illustrations. Cloth: $69.50 ISBN 0-691-03597-0 In the early Roman Empire a new literary genre began to flourish, mainly in the Greek world: prose fiction, or romance. B. P. Reardon addresses the growing interest in ancient fiction by providing a liter- ary and cultural framework in which to understand Greek romance, and by demonstrating its importance as an artistic and social phenomenon. "Reardon provides an illuminat- ing perspective from which to make sense of this genre, to rethink its place In the critical and literary theoretical map of Greek literature....
