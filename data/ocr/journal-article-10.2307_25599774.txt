<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Relevance and Irrelevance of Romanticism* KARL KROEBER MY title would permit me to exploit the frivolous relevance of much Romantic literature. Do the narrative devices of Jorge Luis Borges add anything to the complex per spectives created by Walter Scott's introductions to his novels? In The Fortunes of Nigel a fictional editor describes his creator, the Author of Waverley, as an "apparition"; in The Monas tery the author addresses a critical letter to this insubordinate creation, and we are aided in later editions of the work by a foot note in the first person discussing "something mysterious in the Author of Waverley'}s reserve concerning Sir Walter Scott." The intricacy of the introductions is in keeping with the conduct of the novels. Waverley, the first and the prototype of all that follow, celebrates a realistic vision obscured by the reading of romantic fiction, yet attainable only by those who read romantic fictions such as Waverley?-the last chapter of which, incidentally, Scott iden tifies as the preface.1 What's so new about Nabokov? But such superficial relevancy can appeal only to effete intel lectual snobs, and I am seriously concerned about the relevance of Romantic literature. I should like to propose, however, that true relevance equates with unpopularity. As Socrates defines love as desire for what we do not possess, so I suggest that those qualities which our culture lacks are those which are truly relevant. If relevance and popularity were to be equated, Blake would be super-relevant. It can scarcely be denied that American culture today "possesses" Blake. His popularity cannot be ignored, though it need not be unreservedly applauded, even by those of us who admire his art. Blake, in fact, appeals to a profound but not neces sarily delightful strain in American culture. Briefly to identify that strain, I observe that the most famous sentence in the most famous American political speech sounds as if it were lifted from a Blakean prophecy: "They shall not crucify us upon a cross of gold!" Being by birth and upbringing a Westerner, I have seen perverse expressions of the revivalist-apocalyptic spirit; also I am a member of what has been called the silent generation, which, to my surprise rather than pleasure, has with appropriate quietness turned into a i. I am indebted to Mr. Kenneth Sroka at the University of Wisconsin for calling my attention to the significant complexities of Scott's introductions. The dissertation Mr. Sroka is writing illustrates perceptively the importance of Scott's prefatory inventiveness. * Originally delivered at the Symposium on the Concept of Romanticism, Boston University, 20 March 1970.

He taps that peculiarly American spiritual dogmatism whose least attractive but most recurrent manifestation is the vigilante, the man who takes the law into his own hands. I am not so troubled that Blake could arguably be aligned on the side of William Jennings Bryan at the Scopes trial?although those who would revolutionize edu cation under Blake's banner might ponder the point. What bothers me more is that in real life "apocalyptic visionariness" tends to deteriorate into what Blake himself most hated, self-righteousness. It might be salutary if our library-bound critics who are so thrilled by his radical spirituality more frequently met the purveyors of apocalyptic visions in the open street. In my view it is for worse rather than for better that apocalypse is so popular today. And, if popularity is relevance, the other Romantics would seem to a degree to be irrelevant. As I tried ingenuously to suggest in my opening comments on Scott, the central Romantic mode is undogmatic, even anti-apocalyptic in the Blakean sense.2 A more representative Romantic figure than William Blake?if I may be permitted to fabricate a Romantic counterpart to that hoary Nobodaddy, the Renaissance Man?is William Smith, born in 1769, son of a Cotswold blacksmith, orphaned young, and brought up in a rural environment, who early became interested in surveying and made his career as a surveyor-engineer. He laid out canal routes, planned swamp drainages, investigated coal deposits. He even saved the prosperity of Bath by repairing the hot springs there. Thus Smith was very much a man of the industrial revolution. He was a man of the concurrent scientific revolution: in 1815 he produced the first geological map of England.3 Smith's profes sion was an excursive one; it took him all over Britain, into its quarries and mines, through its river valleys, and across its escarp ments. In his travels he observed that different layers of the earth contain fossilized remains of different organic forms. Geologic strata, he showed, can be identified by the fossils deposited in them. Smith is representatively Romantic in utilizing his personal ex 2. Much in my definition of Romanticism obviously applies to Blake; no poet, for example, is more committed than he to the inner energy of imagination. I propose, however, that it may be salutary today to read Blake romantically in stead of continuing the trend of forcing other Romantics into his pattern. 3. A heroic undertaking which absorbed much of Smith's energy and earn ings. On Smith's accomplishment see Stephen Toulmin and June Goodfield, The Discovery of Time (New York, 1966), pp. 162-63, an(f Loren Eisely, Darwin's Century (Garden City, 1961), pp. 75-81.</page><page sequence="3">THE RELEVANCE OF ROMANTICISM 299 perience to open up a new range of human consciousness. As Loren Eisely says, Smith discovered the historicity of life, and through him "the world . . . began to realize the nature of time."4 Ro manticism is the measuring of time by life. Smith's achievement is not merely that of showing how geology could be organized through classification of fossil deposits. Implicit in that technique is the more profound intuition that the earth and cosmos are living en tities, not in the old anthropomorphic sense but in a subtler, more meaningful fashion, a fashion which makes possible the unification of science and myth?that fusion being the central Romantic enter prise.5 Modern geology, the basis of evolutionary biology, studies the temporal sequences, the history, of earth's transformations. It is study of the earth as vital, and this is what Romantic art most consistently celebrates, "the one Life within us and abroad." The first question which arouses the Romantic artist is Shelley's last: "What is life?" And the form of Romantic art is determined by what for Shelley is tragic fact: the question remains unanswered. Smith's contribution to geology was a method of inquiry, not a definitive conclusion. This mode of inquiry originated in Smith's specialized but wide-ranging experience and largely self-developed expertise. For the poets, too, self-taught expertise is the means for articulating the broad human significance of personal experience. All the Romantics really subscribe to Wordsworth's basic definition of the poet, a man speaking to men. Yet all of them, including Wordsworth, regard the practice of poetry as a special vocation. Romantic poetry, like Smith's geology, serves to advance, not the material success of society, but the grander cause of civilization and the evolution of the progressive powers of the mind. Wordsworth insists that only through celebration and sanctifica tion "Of the individual Mind that keeps her own / Inviolate re tirement" do we attain the possibility "Of joy in the widest com monalty spread." Or in his less famous phrasing: "Possessions have I that are solely mine, / Something within which yet is shared by none. ... I would impart it, I would spread it wide." Romantic individualism is thus double-edged. Individualism is also cultural, though not social, representativeness. From "This Lime Tree Bower My Prison" to the "Ode on a Grecian Urn" we find poetry directed toward the paradoxical unifying of solitude and commonalty, de 4. Eisely, pp. 77, 79 5. The relevance of this enterprise to our age of specialization is suggested by the circumstance that the most enduring cultural forms devised by men have been congruent with principles of natural existence.</page><page sequence="4">300 KARL KROEBER fining individualism as basic humanness. Wordsworth's quietistic retirement and Byron's exotic misanthropy are contrary modes of representing the same view of the human condition, what I call the "anthropological perspective." I so describe it not so much because it fits Feuerbach's definition of the great task of the nineteenth century, to transform theology into anthropology, but because anthropology (a science invented by Romantics) is the study of the relation between individual achievement and culture, culture being the quality, the controlling significance, of social patterns. Inseparable from this perspective is Romantic focus upon en ergy. Practically this focus appears in the development of new sources of power, particularly steam power, at the end of the eighteenth century. Philosophically it appears in a new concern for, and a new concept of, the "genius" as one who transcends his culture. Its obvious aesthetic manifestation is light: few Romantic poems lack reference to optical phenomena. But the paradoxical function of light in Romantic art is well illustrated in J. W. M. Turner's Regulus, in which one does not see, as one would in a neo-classical picture, the Roman patriot himself, but the means of his torture and death (Regulus' eyelids were cut off and he was exposed to bright sunlight): the painting is a blazing glare of African sunshine.6 The blinding qualities of light, the primal form of physical energy, are frequently emphasized by the Romantics. Wordsworth's visionary gleam is lost in the light of common day. One of Shelley's major images is the star which "shines dead," obscured by daylight.7 In the poem "What is Life?" Coleridge asks: Resembles life what once was deem'd of light, Too ample in itself for human sight? An absolute self?an element ungrounded All that we see, all colours of all shade By encroach of darkness made? The Romantics believe we must learn, or remember, to see through light, which, however attractive, threatens the invisible inner energy they call imagination. The projective radiation of imaginative power, not light, is the most potently refined form of the energy which constitutes the eternal vitality of the universe. Physical light, primary evidence that the cosmos is a structure of forces rather than a collection of things, is sometimes used to sym bolize the power of imagination. But light does not individuate. 6. Derived from John Gage's excellent study, Color in Turner: Poetry and Truth (New York, 1969), p. 143. 7. "The Cloud," 1. 34.</page><page sequence="5">THE RELEVANCE OF ROMANTICISM 301 Individuation is a process of the transforming imagination, because its energy alone gives man the potency to participate interactively, therefore creatively, in the total life of the cosmos. Physical light, external energy, only distinguishes, only isolates. Light alone de fines differences; it alienates. So merely Enlightened society is evil. Superficial enlightenment turns men into responding mechanisms, defines them by their reactions to stimuli.8 Enlightened social ar rangements are expressive of a crude behavioral psychology, are in fact Utilitarian. This social psychology, one might say, pictures man to himself merely by the light he reflects, what sociologists call his role. The poet sees man's true self as pictured creatively by his projection outward of an inner, invisible, transforming en ergy.9 This projectiveness alone permits authentic interactions, inter activeness being life. The Romantic, therefore, overcomes alienation by a retreat to solitude. Solitude is not loneliness. Loneliness, in Paul Shephard's beautiful phrase, is having no place to hide. But in solitude, says Wordsworth, are found "the hiding-places of man's power,"10 places of freedom from stimulus-response existence in which one can activate the projective shaping energy which will connect us interactively to the world and our fellow men. Withdrawal is necessary because shaping power requires precise focusing. Like a laser, the penetrating beam of imagination derives from an intense concentration which enables us to see through. As descriptive poets, portrayers of surfaces, the Romantics are inferior both to their Augustan predecessors and their Victorian successors. Notice, for instance, how Coleridge looks at what I call a water-skater. Most of my readers will have observed a small water-insect on the surface of rivulets, which throws a cinque-spotted shadow fringed with prismatic colours on the sunny bottom of the brook; and will have noticed, how the little animal wins its way up against the stream, by alternate pulses of active and passive motion, now resisting the current, and now yielding to it in order to gather strength and a momentary fulcrum for further propulsion. This is no unapt emblem of the mind's self-experience in the act of thinking.11 8. The torture of Regulus might be called the terminus ad quern not of barbarism but of enlightenment. 9.

Water-skaters I have observed, incidentally, cast a six-spotted shadow.</page><page sequence="6">302 KARL KROEBER Much sterile debate about aesthetics could be avoided if scholars would recognize that no Romantic has any interest in numbering streaks on a tulip; he portrays an insect by delineating its refracted shadow. This looking past, indeed, is what makes Coleridge's "em blem" apt, for what he elucidates is the process "of the mind's self-experience in the act of thinking." Coleridge "describes" the action of self-consciousness which uniquely distinguishes man.12 And it is very much to his purpose to connect the peculiarly human psychic process to a law of physical activity so fascinatingly visible ?at least to the imaginatively informed eye?in the movements of one of nature's most trivial creatures. Coleridge in fact ties together the spiritual-psychic system (the domain of myth) and the natural physical system (the domain of science) by defining a principle common to the thoughtless water-skater's bodily progress and to the mind's progressive self-understanding: how both "win" their way in a fluidly shifting environment. The principle is that of alternation between active and passive motion?the basic law of life is pulsation. This is why there are vigorous Romantic poems in praise of idleness and indolence, and why Romantic celebrations of energy carry the implication of concomitant passivity.13 From the perception that life is alternating rhythm, the very pulse of time, derives the Romantic fashion of uniting opposites, which is not by compromise, not by any via media, but, instead, by elucidation of the rhythmic coherence created through polarity. "Joy" and "sorrow," "subject" and "object," "myth" and "science" ?the intensity of each "contrary" must be realized if the vital cadence uniting them is to be attained. So if Prometheus is a Ro mantic archetype, it may be because he for so long and patiently hung out in the Caucasus. The titanic embodiment of energy is simul taneously a figure of absolute passivity. Shelley's Prometheus Un bound, in which the interior psychic and the exterior cosmic are so dramatically inter-embodied, exploits this fundamental duality, and not alone in Act I. The volcanic Demogorgon in Act II quite appropriately burbles enigmatically, shapelessly, and motionlessly as the live center of the turning earth. In Act III Prometheus, unchained, instantly withdraws with Asia to a cave. Sexual realism, 12. The passage I have quoted introduces Coleridge's definition of imagina tion as an intermediate faculty both active and passive; cultural capabilities ultimately depend upon imagination as so defined, because supra-biological transmission requires complex psychic capacities, the ability to learn, etc. 13. Because for the Romantics projective power is inseparable from recep tiveness, we find in their poetry a good deal of what might be called "negative sensuousness," in Keats's phrase, "The feel of not to feel it."</page><page sequence="7">THE RELEVANCE OF ROMANTICISM 303 yes, but also a retiring titanism.14 And in the fourth act, the duet of spinning earth and circling moon marvelously evokes the har monic stillness, the Coleridgean fulcrum, which makes possible the revolution through space which is earthly life, whose ultimate potency is emblemized in a sleeping infant. Shelley's untitanic Titanism is a macroscopic manifestation of the special vitality in his poem's language?where the action really is. In Prometheus Unbound the usual meaning, the hardened surface sense of words, is woven into a veil infolding and revealing new significancies, veritable Demogorgonic potentialities of language. The play is musical, not so importantly in the obvious fashion in which it is like an oratorio, but more importantly in its arrange ments of words so that their customary separateness dissolves, diffuses, dissipates into new interdependencies of signification, as the sounds of diverse instruments in a symphony by interpenetrat ing reveal their peculiar integrities.15 Thus, to cite as brief an illustration as possible, when Panthea (fresh from her dream-vision) appears to Asia at the opening of Act II, Asia's greeting, I feel, I see Those eyes which burn through smiles that fade in tears, conveys not a pictorialization of Panthea's face but how true per ception fuses "feeling and seeing." It also conveys how the mutable alternations of joy and sorrow are consumed, "burned through," how inner illumination transfigures the features which make emo tions visible. Because the line does not present a fixed image, we are forced to recognize how inadequate are the conventional meanings of "feel" and "see" to designate the complexity and profundity of the acts to which they refer; we realize that both "perception" and "expression" are acts of mutuality. Shelley's so-called descrip tions, whether Asia's view of the Caucasus or his own vision from 14. The "retirement" motif is dramatically appropriate because what Pro metheus and Asia manifest is the power of interdependence: one cannot fully exist without the other. Interaction is life. Jupiter destroys himself, one might say, by asserting his autonomy. In a totally vital cosmos autonomy is death. 15. The qualities of language-transformation I point to are evidenced by the astonishing speed of Shelley's verse, for which an excellent analogue is the "blurriness" of Turner's later painting, which results from his effort to restruc ture conventional modes of seeing. Wordsworth addresses himself to the same point in the remarkable passage in his first "Essay Upon Epitaphs" when he speaks of feelings which "have another and a finer connection than that of contrast?It is a connection formed through the subtle progress by which, both in the natural and the moral world, qualities pass insensibly into their con traries. . . ."

Their apparent pictorialism is illusionary, for their putative images do not so much "imitate" externalities as restructure the language by which man is enabled to interact with nature. True Romantic art is an act of participation in the phenomenal processes it represents. Having read at, not in, Husserl, I hesitate to call the Romantics phenomenologists. It seems wiser, and simpler, to say that their poetry is of how things happen. Keats's beautiful To Autumn defies much of our criticism because it has no meaning in the sense in which most modern critics seek meaning. There are no answers in the poem?of the six full stops in it, three are interrogatives. The poem conveys only how autumn happens. It is not about a Kierkegaardian leap. Instead it is so presented that to respond fully to it we must make a Kierkegaardian leap, we must participate in the process of autumnality. The salient point here is that Romantic phenomenalism is apparent even, perhaps especially, in visionary poems. Visions are identified as visions, and how they occur is as important as their nature. It is not merely a joke to say that the most imaginative portion of Kubla Khan is its preface. The concern for how things happen makes reference to Romantic "mysticism" a cop-out. For the Ro mantics the mystical is the process of the mundane. The greatness of the Intimations Ode, for example, is that its visionariness cannot be disentangled from its representation of the commonplaceness of growing old. W. B. Yeats has many poems about age and youth, even about age and youth together, but never to my knowledge does he deal as Wordsworth does with the process of aging. Poetry participating in experience, not merely about experience, must necessarily be an art of time. Romantic visions are of time, even when out of time. Wordsworth has been ridiculed for sneering at Voltaire in the second book of The Excursion when the Poet and Wanderer find a rain-swollen copy of Candide abandoned by the Solitary, he having taken to cheerier occupations such as at tending funerals. But the physical symbol, the deteriorating book, is Romantically appropriate. Art should be the "foster-child of silence and slow time." Art attains its special integrity by inter acting with the continuing processes of life, the true "hiding places" of power. The attraction of epitaphs for Wordsworth is that they so participate. An epitaph, which is, one should remember, a me morial to an individual, he says is not a proud writing shut up for the studious; it is exposed to all, to the wise and the most ignorant; ... it is concerning all and for all:?in the</page><page sequence="9">THE RELEVANCE OF ROMANTICISM 305 Church-yard it is open to the day; the sun looks down upon the stone, and the rains of Heaven beat against it.16 In his typically literal fashion Wordsworth here represents a funda mental Romantic view: poetry is a function of living, it is not something intellectually isolated, beyond the common exigencies of ordinary existence. It is not meant for the astrodomes of academic scholarship. It is meant to enter as one, though one more than usually vital, element in the ecological actuality of man and animal and rock and plant and sun and wind. Romantic spontaneity, therefore, is antithetical to the absurdist spontaneity of the pop-up, pop-out, pop-off art of recent decades. In attacking Voltaire Wordsworth aims less at the Enlightenment per se than at the recurrent intellectualist assumption that temporal continuity doesn't really matter. This assumption underlies the mod ern aesthetic of randomness, Freud- and Jung-derived schools of mythic interpretation, and the poor old New Criticism which con temporary mythomania has subverted. Voltaire's significance is that he speaks not merely for the Enlightenment but for Cleanth Brooks and Northrop Frye and the Living Theater as well when he says: "Past times are as if they had never been. It is always necessary to start at the point at which one already stands, and at which nations have arrived." 17 To a Romantic this view breeds evil and despair. Men, says Coleridge, "are not good and wise enough to contemplate the past in the present, and so to produce by a virtuous and thoughtful sensibility that continuity in their self-consciousness, which Nature has made the law of their animal life. Ingratitude, sensuality [in 1970 read "pornography"], and hard ness of heart, all flow from this source. Men are ungrateful to others only when they have ceased to look back on their former selves with joy and tenderness. They exist in fragments. Annihilated 16. Zall, p. 103. 17. The sentences from the Treatise on Tolerance (1763), in which Voltaire argues that reverence for the past must not prevent us from taking advantage of the advances of reason, are quoted from Ernst Cassirer's The Philosophy of the Enlightenment, trans. F. C. A. Koelln and J. P. Pettegrove (Boston, 1955), p. 168. Cassirer's chapter on "The Conquest of the Historical World" is the best informed defense I know of Enlightenment historicism. As he says, "The com mon opinion that the eighteenth century was an 'unhistoricaP century . . . cannot be historically justified. . . . The Enlightenment forged the weapons for the Romantic attack on its lack of historical sense (p. 197). Cassirer is right, yet when one studies more than historiography, taking into account the attitudes of poets, practical men, and scientists, the profounder "historical" bias of the Romantic era is apparent.</page><page sequence="10">306 KARL KROEBER as to the Past, they are dead to the Future. . . ." 18 Not surprisingly, Coleridge climaxes the passage with a quotation of "My Heart Leaps Up When I Behold," as vividly dramatizing the emotional continuity he claims essential to both art and life. Commitment to such continuity requires courage, for an intel lectual probably not least courage to prefer sentimentality to ster ilization of feeling. Such commitment requires a mature intelligence beyond "the mere mentality of apocalypse" (to borrow Renata Adler's phrase); it requires that flexile purposefulness of spirit which Professor Gerard calls the "ontological scepticism"19 of Romantic poets. Perhaps such commitment and purposefulness are irrelevant to the 1970s. I suggest, however, that Romanticism enables us to reconsider our presuppositions as to what constitutes relevance. If all that is really pertinent are archetypes, ecological actualities ought to be disregarded in art and life?until both are self-polluted into non-existence. If, as academic critics teach, all that matters, all significance, is the eternal, the timeless, pattern within immediate moments of experience, our past has been annihilated, and we are dead to the future. Romanticism could be valuable today because it points to a radically different political aesthetics, one that defends, celebrates, and so sanctifies the surprising continuity that is life.
