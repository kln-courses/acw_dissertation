<plain_text><page sequence="1">RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF BIOLOGY BY JOSEPH NEEDHAM Gonville and Caius College, University of Cambridge INTRODUCTION The immutability of philosophical thought meets the changefulness of the science of biology in that difficult region, which is yet so attractive, the abstract aspects of the study of living things. The philosophy of biology, as it is usually called, is a most unsatisfactory name, for it implies that the philosopher may be defined as the reverse of the specialist who knows continually more and more about less and less. But philosophy is to be understood here in a much wider sense than metaphysics, and must be thought of as part of the theory of scientific investi- gation as a whole, the self-criticism of the scientific method, and the fascinating attempt to prophesy before the event whether indeed all the realm of living phenomena will follow the inorganic world into the obedience of mathematics. Nobody doubts that Laplace's calculator could have known all about the geology of our era, but whether he could have predicted the constitution and behavior of our standard white rats, and what they think of our feeding experiments, is another matter, and -a point of faith on which many a biologist would prefer to be silent. Reassessments in philosophy are only needed once or twice in a century, though in biology special journals called Reviews have to be provided entirely for them. Progress in the theory of biology stands midway between these extremes. Unlike philosophy proper, the theory of biology is by no means independent of experi- mental results, although it is true that it needs a very well-aimed stone to trouble her remoter waters. But as will be seen in the reassessment that I propose to make in this paper, now and then experimental results do appear that exercise a very definite influence on the development of the philosophy of biology. Indeed, in the last resort, since we deal here with matters that are more scientific than metaphysical, the final appeal will be to the facts and not to reason, for the biolo- gist like any other scientific worker must be an empiricist to the end. THE CONCEPT OF THE ORGANISM The theoretical standpoint that can best be called "Organicism" is probably the most important factor in these considera- tions at the present time. The word was originally coined by Delage (ii) for his great work on biological theory and was used by him in connection with the ideas of Bichat, von Baer and Roux. It was, however, given an entirely new lease of life in I9I7 byJ. S. Haldane (i9), who then used it to describe his own views. These are so familiar to biologists that there cannot be any necessity to repeat them here; it will suffice to say that for him the 77</page><page sequence="2">78 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY living organism as a whole with all its complicated phenomena of regulation presented features that it was impossible to imagine in any constellation of purely physico-chemical processes. The tend- ency of the organism to maintain its external and internal environments abso- lutely constant at its own optimum, the vis medicatrix naturae, and the preservation of individuality in living organisms, all were adduced by him as examples of phe- nomena so different from those of the inanimate world that conceptions quite foreign to physics and chemistry would be necessary to account for them in a reasonable manner. Moreover, he felt strongly that these conceptions were in a sense more profound than those of me- chanics, and in I9I9 he thought it right to maintain that far from physiology being reducible to physics and chemistry, the latter might be reducible to the former. "That a meeting,place," he said (zo) "be- tween biology and physical science may at some time be found, there is no reason for doubting. But we may confidently pre- dict that if this meeting place be found, and one of the two sciences is swallowed up, it will not be biology." This theme, like so many others in these regions was not quite new and had had some interesting historical relationships. Cagniard de Latour and others, for in- stance, had difficulty in persuading bio- chemists of the necessity of the yeast-cell in fermentation, owing to their distaste for attributing chemical processes to "vital activity." As a prophecy it has borne fruit very much more rapidly than that famous one of Kant's about the blade of grass, though as in that case we still cannot be sure whether the true messiah has arrived or no. Fulfilment of Haldane's prophecy may perhaps be seen in the fundamental work of A. N. Whitehead, who in his book Science and the Modern World (56), sets out an organic theory of nature. Still more recently a most lucid commentary and amplification of his suggestions has been given by C. Lloyd Morgan (39). The concept of the organism is now carried over into the inorganic world, and the whole universe is regarded as being made up of organisms, some of greater complexity than others but all possessing the properties of organ- isms. The distinguishing feature of an organism is that its parts are not entities having a full existence by themselves, but rather owe their being to the whole of which they form parts-so that if the whole is taken to pieces, the parts entirely cease to be what they were. Each part is what it is not in its own peculiar right, but by virtue of its relatedness to all the other parts in the whole. Already in Life, Mind, and Spirit (38), Lloyd Morgan had maintained that this kind of relatedness of parts within wholes was not a criterion of living things sufficient to distinguish them from non-living things, and A. N. Whitehead has worked out in great detail the concept of the organism in the physico- chemical world. To say that there is the same kind of internal inter-relatedness about physico-chemical organisms as about living organisms or social organisms is not to assert that there is no difference between these sorts of organism. The most extreme of the old-fashioned biologi- cal materialists never denied that there were differences between living animals and inorganic systems, for that would have been too obviously contrary to common sense; he simply said that the differences were of degree and not of kind, that the former, in a word, were only complicated special cases of the latter, whereas his opponents definitely brought in something new. It is this in the modern extension of the concept of the organism that is so impor-</page><page sequence="3">DEVELOPMENTS IN PHILOSOPHY OF BIOLOGY 79 tant for the theoryof biology. It means- if recent "organicism" is justified and maintains the positions it has gained- that another middle line of partition between living matter and dead matter is to be abandoned. There have been many of them, but none have withstood the advance of exact biology. If this proc- ess is followed historically it can be seen how the two most obstinate and irreducible characteristics of life were its finalistic or teleological aspects and its special arrangement in organisms, entities with a high degree of internal relatedness and dependence. The former of these has vanished with the realiza- tion of the teleology of the inorganic world, an event that will always be associated with the name of Lawrence Henderson, and now the latter would appear also to be universally present throughout nature. "Some biologists" says Lloyd Morgan (39) "interpret all or- ganic action in the modal terms appropriate to physics and chemistry, others there are whose interpretation is couched in the modal terms appropriate to psychology. It is difficult to see on what logical grounds biologists of the first school- the so-called mechanists-can resent the downward extension of the connotation of the word 'organism' to natural entities which as they claim differ only in their lack of superadded complexity and no wise essentially in type of action or behavior. It is, however, easy to see on what logical grounds biologists of the other school-the so-called vitalists- can resent, and will no doubt reject, a concept of the organism which implies that- it can adequately be discussed in terms of an organic theory of nature without introducing any further concept such as entelechy or elan." I suggest that the discovery of the value of the concept of the organism in the philosophical aspection of physico-chemical phenomena, is of great importance for the theory of biology. Workers in exact biology would in any case have had to go on using mech- anism as a working principle in research, because as is well knowet it is the only one that will work; but it will relieve them to learn that the concept of the organism is no longer purely biological. The field of physics and- chemistry, which was for- merly covered by the mechanistic schema, continues to be so covered, only now the concept of the organism covers it also. Whereas until recent times, mechanism was held to be the only way of interpret- ing physico-chemical phenomena, while there was great doubt as to whether mechanism or organicism was the only way of interpreting life phenomena, now both mechanism and organicism come into force over both domains of experience. In other words we have to deal not with two opposing and incompatible modes of explanation struggling between them- selves for fragments of our experience, but rather with two complementary and different modes of explanation covering the entire expanse of living and non- living things. If we reserve the name of science for the mechanistic mode of in- terpretation we shall only be obeying a necessary outcome of the quantitative and metrical character of the scientific method, and organicism, covering both realms as it now claims to do, we shall term a philosophical theory. Thus to the scientific mind the living and the non- living form one continuous series of sys- tems of differing degrees of complexity, all of which consist of parts that can be understood as parts when separated from their wholes and are therefore interpret- able in terms of "metrical macroscopic mechanism;" while to the philosophic mind the whole universe, itself perhaps an organism, is composed of a vast number</page><page sequence="4">80 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY of interlacing organisms of all sizes. Organisms explode into nothing when taken to pieces, systems remain in the form of parts the relations of which can be understood. In this way the incur- ably analytic character of science con- tributes its force to the conclusion that anything may be subjected to scientific study but nothing sucked entirely dry of significance by so doing. Thus if J. S. Haldane's prophecy has been fulfilled, it is not without a certain irony. Physics has not swallowed up physiology nor on the other hand has physiology swallowed up physics; they have devoured each other and of the old antithesis nothing is left. To what extent the relegation of the concept of the organism to philosophy is absolute must still, however, be consid- ered a little uncertain. In spite of its history as measured in years, the concept is still so young that we are not yet sure whether there is a sense in which the term would be applicable to a scientific hypothesis pure and simple. It is just conceivable that organicism might stand in the peculiar position of being a scien- tific hypothesis as well as a philosophical theory. The most important factor in this situation is the work of C. D. Murray (40, 4I). In several recent papers this physiologist has applied the principle of minimum work to physiological organ- isms, and his success has already been very considerable. In Murray's view, the concept of organization is definitely not an "affair of the reflective judgment" but a very legitimate field for scientific experiment and calculation. Murray con- siders that at least two statistical laws may be obtained from the study of living organisms, both of which afford a quanti- tative expression of the complex systems in question. The first of these he terms the "principle of maintenance of steady states' '-this would correspond to the maintenance of constancy of external and internal environment-and the second, the "principle of minimum work." This second principle states that the cost of operation of physiological systems tends always to be a minimum, and thus is an extension of the well-known principle of Lagrange. Murray works out this conception in its relations to the physiol- ogy of the circulation and gives a prelim- inary answer, at any rate, to the question, "In any extra effort by the organism as a whole, how is the tax or effort distributed among the various organs of the body (the parts of the whole) and what does each contribute to the extra effort of the whole?" This is certainly a most impor- tant section of the problem of organization. The principle of minimum work has the great value of defining mathematically the distribution of function among the parts of the organism. But the undecided question is, whether the word organism means here the same thing as it does in Whitehead and Lloyd Morgan. It is very doubtful whether it does, for an organism in their language means a whole that does not exist dismembered in the constituent parts, and can only be understood as a whole. There would appear to be three ways at least of thinking about a bicycle, (a) to regard it as an object capable of movement and only truly seen in its whole- ness (Whitehead and Lloyd Morgan), (b) to analyze it in the confidence that the relation between the parts can be under- stood in isolation and systematically i. without actually taking it to pieces (Murray) and z. with actual analysis (the majority of biophysicists and bio- chemists). In any case, the slight resid- uum of organicism left behind in science by the transplantation of the concept of the organism into a general philosophical theory of nature will no doubt be readily</page><page sequence="5">DEVELOPMENTS IN PHILOSOPHY OF BIOLOGY 8i dealt with by the scientific method. Summed up as it is in Wordsworth's "We murder to dissect" organicism is certainly far from characteristic of the scientific mind. LIVING MATTER AND THERMODYNAMICS The relations of living systems to the law of entropy have been considered again and again during the last fifty years, and now very recently the question has been reopened by F. G. Donnan. That living things should be in some way exempt from the otherwise universal law that free energy tends always to decrease in amount in the known universe and entropy to increase, has many times been asserted, though without any evidence. The earli- est hint of this is found in the writings of Lord Kelvin, then Sir. W. Thomson, who said as long ago as i852. "It is impossible by means of inanimate material agency to derive mechanical effect from any portion of matter by cooling it below the temperature of the coldest of surrounding objects" (5X). Thus, as Guye says, Thomson was already making reservations on the applicability of Carnot's principle to the mechanism of living systems. Then in i882 H. von Helm- holtz (2.4) definitely suggested that living cells might have some way of eluding Carnot's principle. In a paper read be- fore the Berlin Academy of Sciences on February 2. of that year he said in a footnote, referring to the impossibility of any increase of free energy: "Whether such a change would also be impossible in the fine structure of living organized tissue appears to me still to be an open question, the importance of which in the economy of nature is very obvious. " Here there was already the hint of the mechanism by means of which this might be done. The appreciation of the sta- tistical nature of the second law, gave it, however, much greater precision. James Johnstone (2%9) and G. N. Lewis (3I) more recently both decided that living things and living things alone can retard the accumulation of entropy. Now obviously the most astonishing things may be hidden by statistical treatment. Some- where in the universe water may run uphill, though as a whole, and in general, it does not do so. The treatment of men on a statistical basis furnishes results of great value, but there we know directly and by observation how individual the individual is. This may be also the case with molecules, and it is a commonplace that to an intelligence such as a Clerk- Maxwell demon they may have very pronounced individuality. As G. N. Lewis says, there is certain astronomical evidence that indicates the existence of disentropic phases in the universe, phases in which the amount of bound energy is diminishing instead of increasing; it is, therefore, equally possible that in the living body there are also phases where the statistical second law does not truly apply. That living plants retard the accumulation of entropy by storing free energy is undeniable, but that any living system ever reverses this process is another matter. Nevertheless bothJohnstone and Lewis regard it as the main characteristic of life, as does Driesch (I3), who says "Es gibt seine Diimonen. Wir selbst sind sie!" In I9I9 Guye (I7) devoted some space to the examination of this question. He showed clearly that the high efficiency of physiological systems in no way proved that they functioned contrary to Carnot's principle, but rather that they were not true heat engines, a fact quite well appreciated by physiologists. He also demonstrated that the retardation of entropy-increase by the green plant was a process that could be paralleled in several non-living systems, for instance, the evaporation of the oceans.</page><page sequence="6">82. THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY But the realization of the statistical nature of the Carnot principle had certain impli- cations for biological theory. If the law of entropy may justly be compared to the law that a large and equal number of black and white grains shaken up will produce a grey powder, then two considerations emerge. Firstly, the sorting out of the grains could be accomplished by a Maxwell demon-in Lewis' terminology, a cheat-acting in the system, and sec- ondly, by prolonging the agitation till a fluctuation of a very rare type led back to the original condition, on the basis of Heraclitus' remark- 'If one is suffi- ciently lavish with time, everything possi- ble happens'"-surely not due to Hero- dotus as Guye would attribute it. This reminds one of F. R. Japp's refusal (X7) to believe that if a font of type was shaken up in a bag, the text of Hamlet could possibly result, however long this was continued, and of P. F. Frankland's reply (I4) that if the time allowed was infinite, Hamlet must re- sult. What is sure, at any rate, is that the statistical nature of Carnot's prin- ciple does not preclude such a rare fluctuation, nor less rare minor ones tend- ing in the same direction. As Johnstone said, a philosophical consideration of this subject must take into account chances which even an insurance company would at once set aside as of no matter. Now "The fluctuations," says Guye (i8), " 'which can occur in a given element of vol- ume are in general the more important the smaller the number of molecules contained in the homogeneous element of volume considered. The reply to the foregoing question will depend therefore, on the degree of tenuity which is attributed to the structure of the tissues and of the living matter. " This is, indeed the aspect of the question that has recently been engaging attention. A. V. Hill (2,5) came to the conclusion recently that "It is conceivable that the ultimate minute mechanism especially of the smallest living cells, may somehow be able to evade the statistical rules which govern larger systems; it may for example like Maxwell's demon be able to sort molecules, to use the energy of the more rapidly-moving, to employ a uni- directional permeability, and so to avoid the general increase of entropy which appears to be the governing factor in all other material change. Such an evasion, if established, would be of ultimate philosophical, biological, and practical importance; there is no evidence, however, of any value, that it really occurs." F. G. Donnan (It), on the other hand, has recently made some calculations which if they do no more, at least keep open the possibility; he has attempted to estimate the size of the element of volume within which an evasion of the second law would be likely to take place. He shows how for all ordinary cases the probable fluctu- ations from the equilibrium state would be quite imperceptible, in other words, the chances would be immeasurably against any deviation from Carnot's principle. But for a small cubical particle of side o. it consisting wholly of molecules of molecular weight Io,ooo the relative thermodynamic probability of an easily detectable fluctuation from the chemical equilibrium state is distinctly high. As Donnan points out, although it is true that most living cells are larger than the imaginary particle in question, some are not, and probably it does not materially differ in size from phases and parts of cells having separate existence as systems to say nothing of the bacteriophage and ultrafiltrable viruses. "It seems, there- fore," he says "very probable that there exist biological systems of such minute dimensions that the laws of classical</page><page sequence="7">DEVELOPMENTS IN PHILOSOPHY OF BIOLOGY 83 thermodynamics are no longer applicable to them. Such laws must be replaced by the statistical theory of molecular fluctua- tion and in the last resort by the theory of individual action." It must be noted that to admit this is not to go so far as Johnstone and Lewis, who assert the existence of disentropic phases within the living cell. The question may, moreover, be approached in another way. If a machine, living or otherwise, is per- fect it should yield up the same amount of work as is put into it, in other words it should waste nothing of the driving force supplied to it. The ratio between the energy put in and the energy got out may be called the "free energy efficiency" of the process, and obviously for a perfect machine this should be unity or Ioo per cent. For a system containing an imagi- nary being such as Maxwell's demon, capable of defeating the second law of thermodynamics by causing a decrease in entropy the efficiency would be greater than ioo per cent. For all known machines it is less than ioo per cent. The parallel between the numerical figure for the efficiency of living and non-living machines is often very close. To compare the animal to a heat-engine, is, as Guye points out, misleading, for the energy of the steam engine is changed in form as it passes through it, but the comparison between the growing animal and a boiler or an electric battery is much closer. The "apparent energetic efficiency" of the developing embryos of the chick, the silkworm, the minnow, and the frog has recently been calculated (Needham (4Xp)) and works out on the average to 77 per cent. This means that out of ioo gram calories presented to the organism in the form of yolk and white 2.3 have to be wasted and 77 can be stored. Similarly, the business of the electric accumulator is to store energy and this cannot be done with an efficiency greater than 75 per cent (Davidge and Hutchinson (io)). The boiler, again, is designed to transfer as much heat as possible from coal to steam, but this can never be done with an effi- ciencygreater than 77 per cent (Brownlie (4)). It is doubtful, however, how much stress can be laid on any numerical corre- spondence between the efficiency of the growing embryo and such non-living machines. What of course would show up the presence of the Maxwell demon in living matter would be an efficiency greater than ioo per cent. Such an efficiency has never been reported for any of the higher ani- mals under any conditions, but it might be thought that the place to look for it would be the iron and sulphur bacteria, maintaining as they do a precarious existence on the most unpromising food- stuffs. This problem has recently been considered by Baas-Becking and Parks (i). They have calculated the free energy efficiencies of many forms of autotrophic bacteria, and though here, if anywhere, living matter might be expected to need demonic assistance, the efficiencies were always very low. The hydrogen bacteria operated at an efficiency of 26 per cent, the methane bacteria at 30 per cent, the nitrite- forming bacteria at 6 per cent. As for the sulphur bacteria the figure obtained was 8 per cent, and for the iron bacteria (sup- posing that such organisms really exist) it would also be very low. These ob- servations certainly seem to be in favor of the views of Hill and against the possi- bility indicated by Donnan and assumed to hold in practice by Johnstone, Lewis, and Driesch. But it must be remembered that an appeal to colonies of bacteria gives no less a statistical result than the appeal to Atwaters' calorimeter. Refer- ence must here be made to a very important recent paper of R. S. Lillie's (34). Lillie</page><page sequence="8">84 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY suggests that the existence of rare disen- tropic phases in living matter, where in- fractions of the second law can go on might account for the subjective persua- sion of freedom which all men have and so introduce a kind of free-will into the structure of science itself. He points out that if such intracellular phases may once with reason be postulated, there is no difficulty in imagining their effect on the body as a whole, in view of the extra- ordinary capacity which the body has of transmitting changes of state from one point in space to another. In this way a voluntary action would arise from an individual escape from the second law in one of the ultramicroscopic intracellular phases in the living being. But is infraction of the second law the same thing as a breakdown of scientific deter- minism? Lillie passes by an insensible transition from the latter to the former, but perhaps this is not justified. Does scientific determinism-in so far as it is not confused with scientific naturalism- make any claim to be more than statisti- cal? If in the scientific formulation of things, the individual always escapes, then anything that individual atoms may do in the ultimate recesses of the animal body is metaphysical in the truest and most literal sense of the word. Lillie himself refers to the expression "physical indeterminism" as a misnomer, and admits that though the laws of the microscopic may not be the same as the laws of the macroscopic, there must be laws of some sort there. And if that is the case, it is difficult to see how on a scientific basis alone there can be any spontaneity or freedom. Thus if we suppose that escape from the second law regularly takes place in the intimate structure of living organisms, it will surely not be escape into freedom but into the arms of some wider statistical law inevitably brought into existence by the operation of the scientific way of thought. Or, in other words, the inductive method will again assert its supremacy and nothing will escape from all this save what always did escape, namely, individ- uality. The unique is the only nut that science cannot crack, and freedom implies uniqueness. Lillie's paper may be said, then, to push back individuality into the disentropic phase, and not, as its title would imply, to reconcile indeterminism with science. But an altogether fresh wind blows through his memoir in question, and it is significant that he draws attention to the importance of the quantum theory for the philosophy of biology. Thermodynamical considerations have recently led to the partial solution of ote problem which was brought greatly into prominence in neo-vitalistic discussions. The extraordinary fact that the swim- bladder of fishes living at great depths contains nearly pure oxygen was first discovered by Biot (3), who analysed the gas during a scientific expedition and had his eudiometer broken by the ex- plosion. "As nearly pure oxygen" said Haldane (wo) "has been obtained from the swim-bladders of fishes living at a depth of 750 fathoms (4500 feet), it fol- lows that oxygen may be secreted into the swim-bladder and retained in it in the gaseous form at a pressure of over iZo atmospheres, whereas the partial pressure of oxygen in the surrounding sea-water is only about one-fifth of an atmosphere. It seems perfectly clear, therefore, that the liberation of oxygen and its retention by the semi-liquid wall of the swim- bladder is the result of an active physio- logical process in the living cells lining its walls, and cannot be explained mechan- ically." F. J. W. Roughton (47) has recently suggested that on the contrary</page><page sequence="9">DEVELOPMENTS IN PHILOSOPHY OF BIOLOGY no necessity need be felt for a complete abandonment of mechanical explanation in this case. If the specific heat of the reactants and resultants of a chemical reaction is known, the equilibrium con- stant can be calculated by the use of Nernst's equation. Now if the equilib- rium constant of the reaction H202 - H20 + 0 catalysed by the enzyme catalase be calculated it works out at Io18.4 from which it may be concluded that not i2o atmospheres but billions of atmospheres would be required to suppress the pro- duction of oxygen from hydrogen peroxide by the enzyme catalase. With this most interesting demonstration there collapses one of the most formidable of the objec- tions on which the neo-vitalists have been accustomed to rely. Haldane (zi) has recently given a historical review of the famous controversy about secretion and filtration of oxygen in the human lung, and concludes still, as against Barcroft, that only the secretion-theory can explain the facts of acclimatization to life at high altitudes. These questions give addi- tional significance to Roughton's cal- culation. REGULATION IN LIVING MATTER The finalism associated with living beings is nowhere more insistently evident than in their unswerving maintenance of steady states. The living organism has as it were a certain niche in its physico- chemical surroundings, and to that it will always return provided that the disturbing influence has not been so great as to throw it out of gear altogether. Its normal hydrogen ion concentration, its normal osmotic pressure, its normal concentration of glucose or salts, its normal physiologi- cal constants, these it will always tend to preserve unchanged. The purposiveness with which it clings to this equilibrium has to be disregarded altogether as such in the application of the scientific method to life phenomena, for teleology is not a concept in any way congruent with measurement. An interesting attempt has indeed been made by Lillie (3X) to give biological purposiveness a quantitative expression by regarding it as a special case of equilibrium, namely between organism and environment, and so applying to it an extended form of the principle of LeChatelier. In spite of Lillie's excellent discussion, however, in which the balance between the constructive and constitutive on the one hand and the destructive and dissipative tendencies in living things on the other are so well set forth, it is still extremely uncertain whether the concept of teleology can be translated into me- chanical terms. It is more likely that these principles are inherently antipathe- tic. Probably they cannot with advan- tage be mixed. But the phenomena of regulation of steady states in living things may be approached from a purely scientific angle. The importance of buffer action was amply appreciated by Lawrence Henderson, and it will be remembered that in the preface to his book The Fitness of the Environment he says that he was led to those considera- tions by researches on the special proper- ties of solutions of phosphates and borates. Buffer action, indeed, must be regarded as a most important factor in organic regulation. The phenomena of oxidation- reduction potential have been also much studied of recent times, and here again systems have been discovered in which an addition of one of the reactants produces a minimum change in the state of the sys- tem as a whole. Such conditions are dis- cussed in the papers of Mansfield Clark and his colleagues (6), and to the phenomenon Clark has given the name "poising action" to indicate its similarity to buffer action in the case of hydrogen ion concentration.</page><page sequence="10">86 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY The importance of these advances for the general theory of biology does not seem to have been sufficiently considered. Driesch's expression "a harmonious equi- potential system" undoubtedly seemed impossible to imagine on a mechanical basis at the time when he introduced the term, but there is now not the same justi- fication for pessimism. It is becoming clearer and clearer that the living cell exists in an extremely balanced condition, well buffered, heavily poised, apt in every way to resist influences tending to move it out of its equilibrium position. Un- successful attempts were made some years ago by L. T. Troland (54) to relate the phenomena of regulation in living cells to the properties of enzymes, but though these failed in detail he was nevertheless on the right track. We may conclude that it is possible, already and in spite of the great incompleteness of our knowl- edge of biophysics and biochemistry, to point to purely physico-chemical systems that would be bound to exhibit, when working in intimate association, simple forms of that tendency to constancy of internal and external environment which the neo-vitalists regarded as preeminently the god in the machine. It is worth while also to study in this connection the exact limits of regulation power, for Lillie's question- "Why can the salamander-entelechy regenerate a leg but not the cat-entelechy?" has lost none of its force. In embryology the re- searches of Spemann and his school, reviewed recently by Huxley (X6) and de Beer (2), have done much to clear the air. The totipotence of the early embryo, or rather, the approximation towards the state of totipotence, which is then observed, falls off rapidly as develop- ment proceeds, and by the time of gastru- lation the process of chemo-differentiation sets in. After this, all development is irrevocably determined, ectoderm cells will make ectoderm and nothing else, until finally in the very late stages regu- lation of form again becomes possible, owing to the assumption of function; this is the stage of Roux's "struggle of the parts." "The inability of organisms to regulate during the period of self- differentiation of different organs can be illustrated by the analogy of an army," says de Beer, "whose staff at the outset of the campaign has determined and as- signed the duties of the various corps. It loses control of these while they are independently performing their allotted tasks, and regains it again later when inter-communication is reestablished. The amazing results of regulation in Clavellina, sea-urchin blastomeres, etc. have led to the forms of vitalism which have been developed by Driesch and others. It is therefore interesting to find that organisms do not always regulate." MINOR CONSIDERATIONS An interesting suggestion as to the nature of tonus and trophic action in living organisms has recently been made by Sir W. B. Hardy (z2). The manner in which nerve fibres control tonus and heat-production in muscle, for instance, has always been exceedingly obscure and has furnished a theme for several neo- vitalist physiologists. It is indeed true that while we have considerable informa- tion about the waves of nervous excitation which produce muscular movement, we know nothing at all about the nature of trophic action and the control of tonus in muscle. Hardy suggests that the explanation may probably be found in the orientation of molecules, a process which can certainly happen in masses of matter though it has been mostly studied in surface films. Experiments with lu- bricants demonstrate that layers of ori-</page><page sequence="11">DEVELOPMENTS IN PHILOSOPHY OF BIOLOGY 87 ented molecules may be several thousands thick, and though this is, as Hardy says, an insignificant example beside the colos- sal ones furnished by the living organism, yet it is the first likely explanation of trophic action that has been advanced and thus removes from physiology the stigma of having absolutely no explanation at all for such phenomena. Reference may also be made to the monograph of Hedges and Myers (2-3), who have collected together a great deal of information about periodical reactions in pure chemistry; reactions which ex- hibit rhythmic pulsation or intermittency. The most famous example of such a reaction is probably the formation of the Liesegang rings. This book forms the most considerable addition of recent times to the literature concerning "simulacra vitae," already very considerable in ex- tent. Although it is true that from a philosophical point of view the signifi- cance of these imitations of living proc- esses can easily be overestimated, yet they have a certain value, and the more they accumulate, andthe more complicatedthey become, the more difficult it is to hold the views of Haldane, Driesch, or Rignano. It is much to be wished that some his- torian would collect the many data in existence about "simulacra vitae" be- ginning with Roger Bacon's speaking head and passing through the automaton chess-players of the time of de la Mettrie to the selenium dog and Lotka's mechani- cal beetle. Finally, a word might be said with advantage about the supposition that the biologist is always, if the truth were told, a thanatologist and that biophysics and biochemistry are simply the study of dead matter which had once been alive. This belief is common; for example, Johnstone (X9) says "Remember the (easily ignored) fact that of living sub- stance we literally know nothing. We study the behavior only of the living organism. Whenever we study organic substance, it is necessarily dead inert material that we investigate." Such in- accurate statements may surely cause great misapprehension in the minds of laymen. Physiology and biochemistry have never been restricted to examining dead animals, and as technique develops they do so less and less. As instances the work of Chambers (5) and others (45) might be given, in which indicators are injected into living cells, or Gelfan's (i 5) micro-electrodes used in a similar man- ner, or again, Seifriz's (48) determination of protoplasmic viscosity by means of an exceedingly minute metal ball intro- duced into a single cell and then caused to move towards an electro-magnet. Vles (55), moreover, has determined the intra- cellular pH by spectroscopic and spectro- photometric methods involving no inter- ference with the living cell at all. The constitution of plant tissue has been ex- amined with x-ray analysis by Sponsler (5o), and Crozier (8) has shown what far-reaching conclusions about the me- tabolism of living animals can be drawn from a study of the effects of tempera- ture upon them, as may also be seen from the beautiful work of O. Glaser (I6), which caused no greater inconven- ience to his paramoecia than getting them to swim through a glass tube at different temperatures. There can be no doubt that as biological methods become more re- fined, the injury caused to the experi- mental material will become ever slighter. CONCLUSION It will not be very difficult to outline shortly the direction which the trend of thought in the philosophy of biology is at present taking. The neo-vitalist school, which some years ago seemed to</page><page sequence="12">88 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY have the future in its own hands, has not been able to live up to its promises. The more its special entities immanent in living beings have been considered, the less necessary they have seemed to be in relation to the facts and the less valuable they have been found as inspirations to research. The finalist school with its insistence on teleology as the special sign- manual of life has been unable to deny the teleology of the inorganic world, so that the Aristotelian conception modified by Kant of the efficient cause and the final cause as two complementary explanations of all natural phenomena remains un- superseded. The older organicism, which saw in living organisms an interrelatedness of parts present nowhere else in the uni- verse, has been swallowed up in an organic theory of nature which regards all things, and even all events, as themselves organ- isms. The classical biological mechanis- ticism with its roots invisibly but surely embedded in the naturalistic view of the world has withered away altogether since the general abandonment of the notion that the application of the scientific method exhausted the content of things. And lastly, the psychobiologists, who asserted that biology could only be made intelligible by employing psychological concepts at all points, have failed to commend their views by producing a serious body of experimental work. Out of the decay of these theories- valuable as they certainly were in their day-have arisen various standpoints one of which has come to be called "Neo- mechanism" (43). It is represented by a variety of biologists and others (53, 37, 9, 2.8, 33, 36, 35, 46,49, and 5I)who all agree in regarding the scientific method as essentially mathematical, mechanical, de- terministic, quantitative, abstract, and by consequence inapt to include the entelechy or any similar conception; and with all this, at the same time a partial, distorted, and as it wete twisted approximation to truth. The neo-mechanistic position, therefore, at one and the same time asserting the universal dominion of the mechanical sort of explanation over all nature, living and non-living, and ad- mitting the inadequate nature of this sort of explanation as a full account of the world, resembles the old mechanisticism in maintaining the heuristic need for the machine, and differs from it in seeing nothing solely ultimate about the ma- chine. It thus recognizes itself to be the way the scientific mind goes to work, and not the manner of thinking in phi- losophy, theology, or art. It differs of course completely from neo-vitalism in denying the bare value of any entelechy or archaeus in living things; it can have nothing to do with any elasticity in its laws, and deprecates that irap'EyK'Xts which Lucretius was weak enough to introduce into his world. incerto tempore ferme incertisque locis spatio depellere paulum, tantum quod nomen mutatum dicere possis.,, It also differs from biological finalism, for it knows teleology to be an unquantitative category, and banishes it from the labor- atory to the domain of the philosophers, who are quite capable of dealing with it. It welcomes the organic theory of nature, for to the exact biologist, nothing is an organism any more than anything else; to the philosopher, all things are organ- isms, and just as the scientific mind sees different degrees of complexity in its systems, so the philosopher sees emergent degrees of complexity in his organisms, up to the world-soul itself. The neo- mechanistic position stands in close re- lationship with the views put forward by R. G. Collingwood in his recent book</page><page sequence="13">DEVELOPMENTS IN PHILOSOPHY OF BIOLOGY 89 Specilum Mentis (7), and for a statement of the theory of science here adopted, the chapters on science in his work are much more than adequate. It is easy to see how the experimental advances which have been collected together in this papet fit in with the neo-mechanistic attitude. The organic theory of nature, which seems to have so great a future before it, is the natural counterpart in philosophy of neo-mechanism in biology and what we know of the thermodynamic aspects of living things gives us little reason for supposing that the laws we have now are likely to break down in biology in the future. Neo-mechanism gives biological science all it wants and at the same time is not easy to attack from a philosophical angle, for the simple reason that it makes no philosophical claims. It may be noted that such a standpoint will not necessarily object to special "biological" laws or explanations, pro- vided that these are clearly understood to possess an "interim" character and to be only awaiting expression in pphysico- chemical terms. There is no harm in classing the poppy with other therapeutic plants as having the "virtus dormitiva" of Galen and of Moliere, provided Over- ton's theory and all its more accurate suc- cessors follow close behind. To say that opium possesses a "dormitive faculty" is a mere restatement of the facts but to say that it does so because morphine is fat- soluble is at least intelligible even though it may not be true. It promises truth to come. But this is not to admit the value of 'special biological laws" con- ceived in terms of "activity, purpose, values" etc. and never intended to be reduced to physico-chemical intelli- gibility. Such generalizations as these still find defenders, e.g. J. H. Woodger (57). "Because mechanics," he says, "quite rightly banishes 'force' and 'ac- tivity' from its conceptual equipment as mere anthropomorphism, is it correct to turn this deanthropomorphizing process on avOpcoros himself?" The answer is yes, if &amp;WOpc'ros is to be an object of scientific study, for a strenuous tendency against projections of ourselves into the external world is one of the principal characteristics of the scientific method. There exists here a confusion of philoso- phy and perhaps theology also with science which has caused much trouble in the past and will cause more. A&amp;Op&amp;nros not deanthropomorphized is a mixture of all kinds of experience, exact biology, philosophic speculation and argument, religious and artistic appreciation, his- torical understanding. In so far as he is the object of scientific thought, he must be deanthropomorphized: and the legiti- mate aversion to paradoxes which we all feel kept within bounds. If, then, for the biologist neo- mechanism seems to fit in best with recent tendencies in the theory of the study of living things, the future becomes clearer than before. There is nothing save the inherent difficulties of research to hinder the advance of exact physico-chemical methods in biology, and these obstacles have never yet daunted the enthusiasm of investigators. It was the paper lions of vitalism in their path that made them hesitate; the fruit of minds overprone to regard as inexplicable that which has not been explained. At the same time, the frank rejection of that philosophy which regarded the scientific method as the only one capable of revealing truth establishes the claim of modern biology to metaphysi- cal respectability. Biology can claim to be well aware of the limitations inherent in the method of science, and of the illimitability of the subject-matter to which it can be applied. James Johnstone, in a recent paper</page><page sequence="14">90 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY (30), has adopted the neo-mechanistic position, which is all the more surprising in that his former works could accurately be described as a "skilful blend of Driesch and Bergson." But now he says "It is a plain and very obvious fact that we have built up our societies and social relation- ships on the basis of quite irrational recognitions of life in other things than ourselves, and it is very curious that we should refuse to consider this experience as part of that which can be explained in physical terms. Yet it is quite certain that biology will never abandon its mechanistic attitude. The latter is some- thing more than merely an hypothesis, it is a demand or an ideal of explanation which we insist upon in our investigation of life activity." It is, in a word, one of the fundamental ways in which we think, and its apriority is something which we cannot possibly get behind. "Mathe- matics, mechanics, and materialism," as R. G. Collingwood puts it, "are the three marks of all science, a triad of which none can be separated from the others, since in fact they all follow from the original act by which the scientific consciousness comes into being, namely, the assertion of the abstract concept." But science is not the only activity of the human spirit. There is indeed all the difference in the world between pushing mechanistic ex- planation as far as it will go with the realization that it will go all the way but will not entirely satisfy you when you have got there, and diluting it with other (qualitative) sorts of explanation, in the hope that the mixture will afford you full satisfaction. It is this latter process that is being given up in biology. Scien- tific explanation and philosophical ex- planation are two distinct foods of the soul, and they are confused only at great peril. Or, in the words of an immortal limerick due to Charles Inge, "There was an old fellow of Crediton, Who took pate-de-fois-gras and spread it on A chocolate biscuit Exclaiming 'I'll risk it!' His tomb gives the date that he said it on." LIST OF LITERATURE (I) BAAS-BECKING, L. G. M., and G. S. PARKS. Physiological Reviews, 1927, 7, 85. (2.) DE BEER, J. R. Experimental Embryology.
