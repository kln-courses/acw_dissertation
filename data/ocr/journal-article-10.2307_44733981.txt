Wismans TNO Automotive, Crash-Safety Centre, The Netherlands Copyright© 1999 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT Mathematical modelling of the human body is widely used for automotive crash-safety research and design. Simulations have contributed to a reduction of injury numbers by optimisation of vehicle structures and restraint systems. Currently such simulations are largely performed using occupant models based on crash- dummies. These models inherit the apparent differences between dummies and the real human body. Further- more, crash-dummies are only available for a limited set of body sizes. In order to assess passive safety for different body sizes, a method has been developed to generate models repre- senting subjects of varying anthropometry. This method has been applied to "scale" crash-dummy models towards different body sizes and proportions. As a next step, models of the real human body for impact loading have been developed. A combination of model- ling techniques is applied using rigid bodies for most body segments, but describing the thorax as a flexible structure. The models allow simulation of global injury cri- teria like chest-deflection, acceleration, and neck loads. For a more detailed analysis, submodels can easily be integrated into the current whole body models. Human body models of different sizes are being developed to allow crash-safety design based on human body models with realistic anthropometry distributions. INTRODUCTION In the past decades, the passive safety of cars has greatly improved. New cars comply with regulated crash- test requirements for frontal and lateral impact. In such tests car occupants are represented by mechanical human body models, the so-called "crash-dummies". Regulated crash-dummies are available for frontal and lateral impacts, and dummies for rearward loading are currently being developed. In addition to mechanical test- ing, computer simulation has grown to be an important tool in crash-safety design. Simulation enables evaluation of vehicle passive safety in early design stages, and thereby is very effective for design optimisation. However, most occupant models used in crash simulations are based on crash-dummies and thereby provide a biome- chanical response differing considerably from the real human body. Furthermore, crash-dummies are available only in a few body sizes. These limitations have been overcome by scaling of crash dummy models towards dif- ferent body sizes, and by modelling of the real human body. This paper deals with such mathematical occupant models, which are divided into three types. • Crash-dummy models • Scaled crash-dummy models • Real human body models. These model types will be discussed with respect to their biofidelity or capability to describe the human response, and with respect to their anthropometry. Figure 1 . MADYMO human models of various body sizes generated from the RAMSIS model, from left to right: 3 year old child, extremely small female, 50th percentile male, extremely large male. Crash-dummies have been designed using biofidelity requirements based on volunteer testing and on post mortem human subject testing. Such requirements pro- vide global biofidelity in terms of e.g. head kinematics and thorax compression in impact conditions. Mathemati- cal models of crash-dummies have a corresponding biofi- delity level. Mathematical modelling of the real human body offers improved biofidelity and allows the study of 3147</page><page sequence="2">aspects like body size, posture, muscular activity and post fracture response. Detailed human body modelling potentially allows analysis of injury mechanisms on a material level. Due to the time needed for design and acceptance of crash-dummies, many years elapse before new biomechanical knowledge is incorporated in regu- lated dummies. Such knowledge can be incorporated much faster into mathematical human models. In the area of vehicle crash-safety design, limited atten- tion is being paid to variations of body size. For adults, current regulations prescribe testing with dummies repre- senting a "50th percentile male" only. For frontal impact two other dummy sizes are available representing a small female (5th percentile) and a large male (95th percentile) (Mertz et al., 1989). A small female dummy for side impact has been introduced as well (Daniel et al., 1995). Due to the time and cost involved in design and produc- tion of new physical dummies the number of available dummy sizes will remain limited. In mathematical impact simulations GEBOD has been used to generate models representing arbitrary body sizes (Baughman, 1983). In our studies the RAMSIS human model has been used as main anthropometry source. RAMSIS has primarily been developed for ergo- nomie analyses and allows the generation of models with a wide range of anthropometry parameters. RAMSIS pro- vides a detailed geometric description of the body seg- ments based on extensive anthropometric measurements on various civilian populations including automotive seated postures. Anthropometric studies have shown that the body dimensions of each individual can be classified according to three dominant and inde- pendent features. These features are body height, the amount of body fat, and body proportion, i.e. the ratio of the length of the limbs to the length of the trunk. Using this classification scheme RAMSIS describes the entire population in a realistic way. This method takes into account correlations between body dimensions which are disregarded in GEBOD. (For instance tall persons typi- cally have long legs combined with a comparably short trunk.) A translator has been developed to convert RAMSIS models into MADYMO models. The conversion can be performed for any anthropometry specified in RAMSIS and examples of such models are shown in Fig. 1 . As will be described in the following sections these anthropome- tries have been used to "scale" dummy models, but also . as a basis for real human body models for impact simula- tion. CRASH-DUMMY MODELS Most occupant models used in crash simulations are based on crash-dummies. The goal of such simulations is to predict the crash-dummy response rather than the response of a real human body. Crash-dummy models have been developed using finite element or multibody techniques. The MADYMO multibody models have proven to be accurate and robust and take a computation time of only a few minutes. Current models are based on a wide range of segment and full dummy tests, and the accuracy obtained in correlation with experimental results is very high. The deviation in many cases is of compara- ble magnitude as the inter-test variability. An example of correlations obtained is shown in Fig. 2. Surfaces have traditionally been modelled with ellipsoids, but "arbitrary surfaces" have also been applied (see Fig. 3). Such detailed surfaces are particularly suitable to simulate interactions with finite element models representing inte- rior paddings, airbags, and belts. Full finite element mod- els of crash-dummies are also available, but such models require a computation time in the order of hours, and robustness problems are still reported. Figure 2.

Eurosid-1 dummy model with "arbitrary surfaces" (triangulated areas) for important contact surfaces, and ellipsoids for other surfaces. SCALED CRASH-DUMMY MODELS Mathematical models of crash-dummies as described in the previous section, are available only for those few body sizes in which hardware dummies exist. Recently, a method has been developed to scale dummy models to a wide range of anthropometries (Happee et al., 1998a). Scaling procedures have been used widely in the field of crash safety. For instance, the design of the Hybrid III small female and large male dummies is partly based on scaling (Mertz et al. 1989). Scaling is relatively simple if all length dimensions scale with the same factor. Such simple scaling is called geometric scaling. Happee et al (1998a) developed a more advanced scaling method. Dif- ferent scaling factors are specified for x, y, and z dimen- sions. Furthermore different scaling factors are applied for different body parts. Thus the model geometry can be adapted freely to the desired anthropometry parameters. The scaling rules applied are largely equivalent to those used for scaling and normalisation (Mertz et al. 1 989, van Ratingen, 1997, Irwin and Mertz, 1997). Scaling is per- formed assuming that material properties are invariant with subject size. Biomechanically this seems to be an acceptable approach for adult subjects. For scaling towards children, or to simulate elderly persons the varia- tion of material properties should be included (see further Happee et al., 1998a). FRONTAL IMPACT SIMULATION WITH SCALED DUMMY MODELS - Thirty models were generated by scaling male and female Hybrid III dummy models towards Ramsis anthropometries (Happee et al., 1998a). The models represent the human variance with respect to length, corpulence and the proportion of seated height to standing height. Frontal impact simulations were per- formed with a driver side model represents an European middle class car. The restraint system contains a driver airbag of 60ltr. and a belt with a retractor load limiter (loa- dlevel: 4kN). The simulation model was also equipped with a deformable steering column. The occupants were positioned in such a way, that they could reach the pedals and the steering wheel and the pelvis angle was set to 25°. Due to the different body sizes the H-point positions of the scaled dummies differs up to 280mm. Kinematics of a very tall/slim male occupant are shown in Fig. 4. The injury parameters of the occupant simulation have shown a large bandwidth of results. Fig. 5 shows the head 3ms acceleration versus the H-Point position relative to the vehicle. The vertical axis shows the deviation in percent relative to the 50th%ile male Hybrid III model. That means, that the results of the 50th%ile male are set to 0% deviation. The results of the three standard dummies are marked with little boxes. The results of the scaled dummies exceed the bandwidth of the three standard dummies. Some higher head 3ms accelerations (&gt;60%) are caused by contact between head and upper steering rim. This occurs for large occupants, where the head moves over the airbag and impacts on the steering rim. On the other hand, extreme small/slim occupants are sit- ting very close to the steering wheel, resulting in increased loading by the inflating airbag. Apparently identical H-Point positions cause a wide range of results for different occupant sizes. Comparable observations were made for chest acceleration and chest deflection (Happee et al., 1998a). Figure 4.

Head 3ms acceleration of scaled dummy models against the relative H-Point-position REAL HUMAN BODY MODELS A large number of models describing specific parts of the human body have been published but only a few of these models describe the response of the entire human body in impact conditions. Models simulating the response of car occupants have been published for lateral loading (Huang et al. 1994a, 1994b; Irwin 1994), frontal loading (Ma et al., 1995), and rearward loading (Jakobsson et al., 1994, Kroonenberg et al. 1997). A model for vertical load- ing has been published by Prasad and King (1974) and pedestrian models have been published by Ishikawa et al. (1993) and Yang et al. (1997). A human model for for- ward and rearward loading has been presented by Happee et al. (1998b). This model has recently been extended for lateral loading and is described below. A mathematical human body model representing a 50th percentile male has been developed (Fig. 6). The human geometry was obtained from RAMSIS anthropometric data which provided a realistic and detailed surface description, in particular for seated automotive postures. A "50th percentile" male model from RAMSIS with 1 .74 m standing height and 75.7 kg weight has been converted to MADYMO and extended to allow crash simulation (Happee et al. 1998b). The RAMSIS model provided: joint locations, joint ranges of motion, segment masses and centres of gravity, and a triangulated skin connected to various body segments. This model was extended as follows. Rotational inertia was derived by integration over segment volume. Here for each segment a homoge- neous density was assumed. Joint resistance models were added and the spine and thorax model was enhanced with additional degrees of freedom as described below. The model has been developed aiming at omni- directional biofidelity where the highest priority was given to the torso and the head-neck system. The model was set up for optimal efficiency and robustness. This has been achieved using multibody techniques available in MADYMO version 5.4. Most skeletal structures have been modelled as rigid bodies connected by joints. Defor- mation of the rib cage has been accomplished using flex- ible bodies (Koppens et al., 1993). A detailed model of the outer surface (skin) has been implemented as an "arbitrary surface", guaranteeing a realistic contact description with car interior structures. The lumped joint resistance resulting from ligamentous and muscular tis- sues has been implemented using non-linear stiffness functions and energy dissipation was implemented using hysteresis or damping. Figure 6. MADYMO human body model representing a 50th percentile male The spine model including the neck is based on a human model validated for rear-end sled tests with volunteer and cadavers up to 30 km/h (Kroonenberg et al. 1997). In this model all vertebrae are modelled as rigid bodies, with joints located as shown in Fig. 7. Joint translational and rotational resistance has been implemented using lumped joint resistance models based on Prasad and King (1974) and de Jager et al. (1996). These resistance models represent the dynamic response and include effects of muscular resistance in a global manner. 3150</page><page sequence="5">Figure 7. The human model in lateral view with joint locations of spine, neck and hips shown as markers In impact the human thorax deforms in a complex 3D manner due to contacts, but also due to spinal deforma- tions. For the current study it was considered sufficient to have a realistic prediction of chest deflections in blunt frontal and lateral impact. Such a prediction of chest deflection is needed to evaluate belt and airbag interac- tions and is also available in current crash dummies. The thorax model consists of flexible bodies simulating frontal and lateral deformation of thorax and abdomen. The limbs have been modelled as rigid bodies connected by joints with resistance parameters based on literature data on human passive joint properties. DETAILED NECK MODEL - A global and a detailed 3D mathematical model of the neck have been developed by de Jager (1996). Both the global and the detailed model represent the vertebrae as rigid bodies. In the global model the vertebral bodies are connected by (non-linear visco-elastic) intervertebral joints, representing the lumped mechanical behaviour of the intervertebral discs, ligaments, facet joints and muscles. In the detailed model these parts are included as separate elements. A further distinction between the global and detailed model is the possibility to simulate active muscle power. In the detailed model the neck muscles are modelled by cord elements connecting the muscle attachment points. This approach provides a way to simulate the active muscle power that the global model is lacking. However it was concluded that modelling the neck muscles as simple cords was not satisfactory. For this reason in a later study conducted by van der Horst (Van der Horst, 1997) the neck model was modified by modelling the neck muscles in more detail. A multi-segment muscle description was applied in which the muscles curve around the vertebrae, resulting in realistic muscle lines of action. Fig. 8a and Fig. 8b show the global and the detailed neck model. Figure 8. ARBITRARY SURFACE DESCRIPTION - Traditional contact algorithms used in crash simulations describe interactions between analytical surfaces like ellipsoids, planes and cylinders, and also finite elements. Recently a contact algorithm has been developed for "arbitrary sur- faces" (MADYMO, 1997). Arbitrary surfaces consist of tri- angular or quadrangular facets which are supported by nodes (vertices) on rigid bodies and/or flexible bodies. Contact can be simulated with other arbitrary surfaces, with ellipsoids, planes and cylinders or with finite ele- ments. In these contacts the compliance of the materials 3151</page><page sequence="6">is taken into account by allowing penetrations in the con- tacting surfaces. For each node of the facet surface the local contact stress is calculated applying a user-defined function of the penetration. The contact force on each node is obtained by multiplying the calculated contact stress by the area around the node. This contact force is transferred from the surface model to the applicable rigid body or flexible body. The outer surface of the human model (skin) is described as an arbitrary surface consisting of 2174 triangular fac- ets connecting 1068 vertices (nodes). This surface is largely supported by rigid bodies. However, in the thorax area the skin is supported by flexible bodies. This allows the thorax skin to "continuously" deform in response to contact loading and spinal deformation. VALIDATION - In order to evaluate the validity of the complete human body model several validations were performed. Validation using volunteer sled tests with fron- tal loading, and validation for frontal blunt thoracic impact is described below. Validation for quasi-static lumbar bending can be found in Happee et al (1998b). Validation for lateral loading will be published elsewhere. A valida- tion for rear-end loading using volunteer and PMHS responses has already been published by Kroonenberg et al. (1997). The above validations of the complete human model were performed with the global neck model. Below, results will also be compared to results obtained with the detailed neck model. This detailed neck model has been validated at segment level for frontal volunteer tests at different severity levels (3g, 6g, 8g, 1 0g, 12g, 15g) and for a 7g lateral impact conducted at the Naval Biodynamics Laboratory (NBDL). A study of different levels of muscle activation showed that muscle contraction has a large influence on the head-neck response (Van der Horst, 1997). Frontal Volunteer Tests - Volunteer tests with frontal loading were performed at NBDL (Ewing et al., 1968, 1969, 1975, 1976). Sled tests ranging from 3-15 G sever- ity were performed on volunteers restrained by a harness belt on a rigid seat. Accelerations were recorded using a head bracket and a lower neck bracket which was strapped to the back at T1 level. These tests were analy- sed by Wismans et al. (1984, 1986) and by Thunnissen et al. (1995) resulting in response corridors. These corri- dors were used for validation of the whole human body model. The seat was modelled as two rigid planes. The harness belt was modelled using MADYMO conventional belts. Resulting signals comparing the global neck to the detailed neck performance are shown in Fig. 9 and kine- matics for the detailed neck model are shown in Fig. 10. Head accelerations are presented in the local co-ordinate systems of the head. Displacements and rotations are presented with respect to sled and seat. For both models the head X and Z displacement demonstrate an accurate prediction of head kinematics and a satisfactory correla- tion has been obtained for head rotation. The head rota- tional acceleration, however shows a more realistic response for the detailed neck model. Figure 9. Validation results of human model for 15G NBDL volunteer test simulation Figure 10. Kinematics of human model for 15G NBDL frontal volunteer test simulation Frontal Thorax Impact - The literature describes several dynamic loading test series performed on the thorax of post mortem human subjects. These include frontal and lateral impacts at various locations with rigid impactors. Several of these tests provided accepted biofidelity requirements for crash dummy design (e.g. SAE J-146 3152</page><page sequence="7">and ISO-N455). These requirements have also been used to validate the human model, and an example of such a validation is given below. To assure the biofidelity of the chest to blunt-frontal mid- saggital impact performance guidelines have been derived (Neathery, 1974). Cadaver data was normalised, load levels were increased with 667 N to account for muscle tensing, and penetration was adjusted by sub- tracting 12.7 mm to indicate the internal sternum deflec- tion. These requirements are accepted biofidelity requirements for crash dummies designed for frontal loading (SAE J 1460). Validation results are shown in Fig. 1 1 and test conditions are illustrated in Fig. 12. Compara- ble validations have been performed with different impact energies and different impact locations including lateral loading. Figure 1 1 . Validation of the human model for 6.71 m/s blunt-frontal midsaggital impact to the thorax, dotted lines represent human response corridors according to Neathery (1974). Figure 12. Kinematics of blunt-frontal thorax impact simulation, before impact (left) and during impact (right). DISCUSSION This paper describes three types of models representing car occupants in impact simulations. They all have their specific potential as described below. CRASH-DUMMY MODELS - The current application of computer simulation in crash-safety design, is largely based on crash-dummy models. The close correlations to hardware tests demonstrate that simulation technology has advanced to be a strong predictive tool. The dummy models, however, are available only in a few body sizes, and apparent differences exist between dummies and the real human body. SCALED CRASH-DUMMY MODELS- With scaled crash- dummy models, the safety of vehicles can be evaluated for subjects with an anthropometry not represented by available dummies. The scaled dummy models are based on scaling methods similar to those used in the design of small and large dummies. Therefore the scaled models are expected to have a biofidelity comparable to these small and large dummies. The frontal impact simulations with new scaled dummy models have shown, that the current standard dummies (5th%ile, 50th%ile, 95th%ile) provide a very limited representation of the real world occupant population since the range of results for the scaled dummies is significantly larger than for the stan- dard dummies. HUMAN MODELS - A mathematical human body model representing a 50th percentile male for impact loading has been presented by Happee et al. (1998b). The human geometry was derived from the RAMSIS anthro- pometric model. This provided a realistic and detailed surface description, in particular for seated automotive postures. Applications are shown in Figs. 13 and 14. The model allows simulation of global injury criteria like chest- deflection, acceleration, and neck loads. For a more detailed analysis, submodels can easily be integrated into the current whole body model. The results presented for frontal loading show that comparable kinematics are obtained by insertion of a detailed neck model, but that aspects like head rotational acceleration are better described by the detailed neck model. Furthermore the detailed neck model allows study of effects like reflex induced muscle activation. These multibody human models require computation times of only a few minutes and provide correlations com- parable to those obtained with finite element models (see Lizee et al., 1998 for a full body model, and Deng et al., 1999 for a thorax model). Finite element modelling has a great potential for analysis of injury mechanisms on a material level. However, with current computers, large scale finite element models require extreme computation times even though relatively large elements and simple material laws are being applied. Using RAMSIS anthropometries a series of human body models of different sizes will be developed and validated using test data from biological specimens of varying anthropometry. This will allow us, on the longer term, to base crash-safety design on real human body models taking into account the large anthropometry variations in current and future populations. 3153</page><page sequence="8">Figure 1 3.

Human model restrained by finite element belts CONCLUSION Occupant models based on crash-dummies are efficient tools to design cars such that they comply with regulated crash-test requirements. Scaled crash-dummy models allow evaluation of the protection offered to a wide range of body sizes. Mathematical modelling of the real human body offers improved biofidelity and allows the study of aspects like body size, posture, muscular activity and post fracture response. Detailed human body modelling potentially allows analysis of injury mechanisms on a material level. REFERENCES 1. Baughman L.D. (1983).
