<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID STERN Itnitatio Hominis: Anthropomorphism and the Characters) of God in Rabbinic Literature OF ALL THE PRESENCES in rabbinic literature, God's is surely the hardest to pin down. A ubiquitous figure, He defies easy categorization or simple definition. There are several reasons for this. First of all, most of the Rabbis7 ideas about God are found in scattered statements of frustrat ing brevity or in fragments of narrative that must be pieced together to make sense. In either case, the Rabbis' ideas are often cloaked in figura tive or imagis?c language that requires more than the usual effort of interpretation. Furthermore, although rabbinic literature does not lack for descriptions of God's nature in the predictable terms of divine majesty, supreme power, omniscience, and so on, it is also the case that He is frequently depicted in the most human-like terms, as a disarmingly familiar figure who acts in ways that often seem improbable for a divinity if not outrightly inappropriate. Whenever the rabbinic conception of God is discussed, the latter passages have traditionally been a major focus of attention pre cisely because they pose in its most blatant form the problem of anthropomorphism?the term I will henceforth use as shorthand for all statements that apply human terms and features to describe God's form (anthropomorphisms proper) and His feelings (anthropopathisms). The Rabbis, of course, did not invent anthropomorphism. Nor were they the first in ancient Jewish literature to employ anthropomorphic language to depict divinity.1 The Bible is famous for describing God as possessing PROOFTEXTS12 (1992): 151-174 O 1992 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">152 DAVID STERN human limbs like eyes and hands (Gen. 6:8, Exod. 31:28); as acting like a human (e.g., walking through the Garden of Eden at noon [Gen. 3:8], regretting having created mankind [Gen. 6:6]); and as having revealed Himself to mankind in human form, as at Sinai with "His feet resting upon the likeness of a pavement of sapphire" (Exod. 24:10), or in the heavenly vision seen by the prophet Ezekiel in which God is seated upon "the semblance of a throne" in "the semblance of a human form" (Ezek. 1:26).2 The Rabbis inherited this literary tradition and, if anything, only intensified its tendencies, exercising their own anthropomorphic imagina tions even more boldly than their predecessors. Thus, the Rabbis continued to refer to God as having human limbs and organs (though most often in statements that are virtually formulaic, if not idiomatic, as when He is said to point with His finger or swear by His right hand, or when a person is said to be worthy of greeting the face of God's Presence).3 Even more strikingly, the Rabbis portray God directly in their own image, as putting on tefillin and studying Torah in the heavenly academy, and deciding the Law.4 And most memorably of all, in the many meshalim found in midrash, the Rabbis used the literary genre of the parable to portray God, albeit obliquely, in the form of a human king who is, as modern scholars have come to recognize, modeled directly upon the known figure of the contemporary Roman emperor or one of his repre sentatives.5 Far from being generalized or stock representations?mere personifications of God's sovereignty in the world?these portraits of God are vivid, highly particularized depictions of recognizably human figures who frequently act in ways that are shockingly undivine? sometimes exhibiting a moving if pathetic vulnerability, at other times acting despotically and unjustly toward their subjects and inferiors. These same features carry over to other nonparabolic narratives in which God figures and acts in ways that are far from what one would expect from Him. In one account He is said to weep inconsolably all night over the destruction of the Temple, while in another narrative, the famous story of the legal controversy over the "oven of Akhnai," after the sages reject God's own opinion in a legal controversy, He is said to have laughed and exclaimed, "My sons have defeated me, my sons have defeated me."6 What does one make of such passages? Traditionally, rabbinic anthro pomorphisms have been discussed mainly with a view to ascertaining the degree to which they reflect the Rabbis' beliefs about God's nature. Did the Rabbis believe that God has an actual human form, and that He is subject to human feelings and emotions, as these passages seem to indicate? Or are these statements to be understood nonliterally, figu ratively, precisely because it is assumed as axiomatic that the Rabbis could never have believed that God actually possesses a human, let alone a corporeal, form?</page><page sequence="3">The Character(s) of God in Rabbinic Literature 153 These terms of belief, as the matrix for treating the significance of anthropomorphism, were first set by medieval Jewish philosophers. The Rabbis themselves rarely explicitly discuss their own use of anthro pomorphisms. When they do, it is mainly to extol the use of anthropo morphism. "Great is the power of the prophets, for they liken the creature (tsurah; literally, form) and its creator (yotserah)," R. Yudan is quoted as saying in Genesis Rabbah 27:17 And in the one place that the Rabbis discuss the "function" of anthropomorphism (as it appears in the Bible), they ascribe to it what we might call a rhetorical or representational function. Commenting on Amos 3:8, "The lion has roared, who can but fear? . ..," the Mekhilta anonymously asks, And who gave strength and force to the lion? Was it not He? But it is merely that we describe (mekhanin) Him by [figures derived from] His creatures so as to break open the ear in its capacity for hearing (leshaber et ha'ozen mah shehi yekholah lishmoa'). (Mekhilta Bafcodesh 4)8 What the Rabbis mean by the concluding phrase in the passage is more than simply the apologetic notion that "the Torah speaks in the language of man." Rather, it is closer to the sense of "breaking" the ear "in" to a certain way of hearing, of "opening" its capacities for understanding. This, for them, is the purpose served by the anthropomorphic representa tion of God. There are no explicit indications in rabbinic literature of opposition among the Rabbis to the use of anthropomorphism.9 The first unequivocal evidence in Jewish literature for discomfort with anthropomorphism?that is, the first time that anthropomorphism appears as a problem, as a source of error and misinterpretation?comes only in the early Middle Ages, with Saadiah Gaon and the arrival in Jewish thought of a philosophical conception of God predicating the absolute incorporeality, unity, and incomparability of the divine being. To be sure, the real problem for most Jewish philosophers, from Saadiah through Maimonides, was less anthropomorphism per se than the matter of divine attributes, that is, whether any property, and especially the so called essential properties like knowing, loving, and powerfulness, can be predicated of God.10 Anthropomorphisms themselves were less problem atic and were understood to be necessarily figurative if only because, taken literally, the statements were so obviously false on philosophical grounds. Even Saadiah sagely acknowledged that "were we, in our effort to give an account of God, to make use only of expressions that are literally true"?by which he meant philosophically true?"it would be necessary for us to desist from speaking of Him as one that hears and sees and pities and wills to the point where there would be nothing left for us to affirm except the fact of His existence."11 Still, the categories through which the philosophers viewed anthro pomorphism as a "problem" have dominated virtually every treatment of the phenomenon since the Middle Ages. Most important, they have set</page><page sequence="4">154 DAVID STERN the framework within which modern scholars have continued to study its meaning, particularly in rabbinic literature. Whether anthropomorphism has been seen as a problem of metaphysics?the nature of God's being? or of the semantics of religious language?as an extreme instance of the question as to whether any human expression can truthfully be applied to the description of God?it has nearly always been approached with a view to determining whether or not the Rabbis believed in the literal truth of anthropomorphic statements describing God and His form. Rarely has the phenomenon been approached even from the perspective that the Rabbis advocated, as a literary phenomenon whose significance was primarily rhetorical or representational. Thus, in his seminal monograph on the "Old Rabbinic Doctrine of God," A. Marmorstein collected nearly every rabbinic statement on anthropomorphism, including exegeses of biblical verses with anthropo morphic imagery as well as independent formulations, but mainly for the purpose of identifying two distinct "schools" among the early Rabbis. Marmorstein then proceeded to trace the development of these schools through later tradition. The first of the schools, which Marmorstein associated with R. Akiba, interpreted biblical anthropomorphisms liter ally; the second, the "allegorical" school, connected to the figures of R. Ishmael and R. Yose Hagelili, expressed "a rationalistic point of view," which tended to explain away anthropomorphisms.12 As Marmorstein showed, the "anthropomorphic trend" gained the upper hand during the amoraic period, while "a small minority cherished and dared to propa gate allegorical doctrines."13 Only in the Middle Ages did the latter gain its real prominence. Marmorstein's history is a tour de force of talmudic erudition; how ever, its major contention, that two schools with distinctly opposed attitudes to anthropomorphism actually existed, is far from certain. Many of the instances in which Marmorstein claimed to have identified a debate between the "literal" and the "allegorical" schools may actually have been contests over exegetical technique, not anthropomorphism. As H.A. Wolfson noted in discussing Philo, the Rabbis' discomfort with anthropo morphism arose not from philosophical qualms but "out of an inner contradiction which native Jewish speculation could not help noticing in Scripture between its doctrine of the unlikeness of God on the one hand and its use of anthropomorphic descriptions of God on the other."14 These contradictions were, foremostly, exegetical, not philosophical or theological. Likewise, the motives behind many rabbinic anthropomor phic interpretations can be shown to be either apologetic or ideological responses to ad hoc occasions rather than discursive propositions about God's being or behavior.15 Essentially, Marmorstein read back into rabbinic literature the later medieval, more philosophically-oriented view of anthropomorphism,</page><page sequence="5">The Character(s) of God in Rabbinic Literature 155 and then opposed that view to what he called the more conservative "literalism" of Akiba's school. Yet, as one reads Marmorstein, the realiza tion gradually dawns that Akiba's school with its literalist view of anthropomorphism has in fact largely been determined by its opponent's position, the more philosophically correct one. More recently, Jacob Neusner has boldly adapted the Hteralists' side, arguing that one can trace through the history of classic rabbinic Judaism a growing tendency that reaches ite climax with the composition of the Babylonian Talmud. In this work?for Neusner, the acme of rabbinic Judaism?God is depicted not only anthropomorphically but as incarnate, as having assumed the full particularity of a human being in the flesh.16 Neusner's audacious claim raises more questions than we can ade quately deal with here.17 For one thing, many of his examples are drawn from rabbinic meshalim; yet Neusner entirely overlooks the parabolic form of these narratives, and in particular the intentional obliqueness of the analogy they draw between God and their fictional protagonists; by virtue of that obliqueness, the authors of the meshalim manage to avoid directly likening God to the meshalim's human characters, and thus seriously complicate every attempt to interpret the parables' anthropo morphisms literally. Still, there remain enough other instances of rabbinic anthropomorphism that can be read as indicating a belief in divine corporeality that it is imperative for us to take seriously Neusner's strongest argument, his methodological claim to reading anthropomor phic statements "to mean precisely what they say"?that is, as being "clear evidence of a corporeal conception of God," and not as "[merely] poetic characterization, or, indeed, what such a more spiritual interpreta tion would have required."18 And indeed, why "not read these passages in the most literal fashion?at face value, as it were? Why not, on their basis, argue, as Neusner does, that the Rabbis must have believed that God was a corporeal being just like a human? The fact of the matter is that, on purely literary and hermeneutical grounds, it will be impossible to prove that at least some anthropomor phic statements cannot or should not be read literally. On the other hand, the question of what the Rabbis themselves believed these statements to mean is also unanswerable in any definitive way. If the Rabbis did indeed believe that God either possesses or could assume a human shape, they would not have been alone in the late antique world. Belief in the visibility of the gods as well as testimonies to divine appearances in human shape are well documented in pagan religion and literature even in late antiquity.19 In addition to the enormously complicated controver sies in early Christianity concerning the divinity of Jesus' corporeality and his humanity, there are unambiguously anthropomorphic doctrines found in early Gnostic texts that may be related in one way or another to esoteric Jewish traditions.20</page><page sequence="6">156 DAVID STERN But if one compares the pagan or Gnostic sources to the paucity of comparable evidence in rabbinic literature, or if one compares the exten sive documentation surrounding the dogma of Jesus' divinity to the almost total absence of any such discussion in rabbinic literature, one cannot help but suspect that rabbinic anthropomorphisms may not have been intended to be taken as unequivocal and unambiguous sources for a belief among the Rabbis in God's literal corporeality Even the one exception to all this, the famous, and famously problematic, document known as Shi'ur Qpmah, proves the general rule against the literal reading of rabbinic anthropomorphisms, for the enormous, even monstrous, measurements of God's body recorded in Shfur Qomah are so fantastic that, as Scholem pointed out long ago, they "have no intelligible meaning or sense-content."21 Indeed, before one naively assumes that all anthropomorphisms, graphically detailed as they may be, inevitably presume a belief in divine corporeality and in the material embodiment of God, it is worth remem bering that in the late antique world, there is no necessary tally between the corporeal body and anthropomorphic language for the body. In a lengthy passage in the early Gnostic text, the Apoayphon of John, its narrator describes how the demiurge Ialtabaoth created the first Adam together with his servant "powers," and then lists each "power" by name and the limb or organ it created. Yet this Adam, as we learn shortly later in the text, was an entirely "animate"?that is, spiritual?creature; only later is Adam actually embodied in material form.22 This is, in short, a wholly "spiritual," incorporeal anthropomorphism, and it is very possible to read rabbinic anthropomorphisms in precisely the same vein. To paraphrase Hamlet, there may be more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your modern scholarship. Finally, and most important, there are powerful and obvious reasons for reading figurative language?or language that appears to be figurative?figuratively. These reasons may be difficult to delineate, but that does not diminish their importance. The fact is that the question of God's corporeality is not the most interesting issue raised by the anthro morphic description of God in rabbinic literature. And when all discus sion of anthropomorphism is devoted solely to the matter of corporeality, the more subtle and fascinating nuances of the portrayal of God in human features are simply neglected and lost. Yet these nuances may offer the real key to the significance of rabbinic anthropomorphism. In order to examine these nuances?the poetry of the anthropomor phic analogy?I wish to shift the terms of discussion in this essay from the matrix of belief to that of literary characterization, and to view the anthropomorphic depiction of God as a problem not of belief but of representation, of the construction of divinity, the characterization of God. Anthropomorphism in this view is not just an idiomatic feature of</page><page sequence="7">The Character(s) of God in Rabbinic Literature 157 rabbinic language, nor is it a theological key pointing to God's corpo reality or to His attributes. Rather, it is a trope and figure, a turning of language consciously and creatively employed to express truth (rather than to obscure or obstruct it, as the philosophical view of anthropomor phism implicitly claims), a way of exploring the nature of God, of characterizing His behavior.23 The irony, even the paradox, behind rab binic anthropomorphism is that the only model of sufficient complexity that the Rabbis possessed to portray God's character?and to communi cate the complexity of their own feelings about God?was that of human character. It was precisely for this reason that anthropomorphism was, in the Rabbis' words, an instrument for "breaking in the ear." And conse quently, the major questions raised by the presence of anthropomorphic statements in rabbinic literature are not, What did the Rabbis believe about God? or How sophisticated was their understanding of God's nature?did they believe He had a body or not??but rather, What is God's character? What type of personality does He have? What sort of character is God? To treat God as a character is not to demean Him. It is also, I hope, not an anachronization. By calling God a character, I do not mean to suggest that He was either a fiction to the Rabbis or any less an object of worship for them; indeed, to the contrary, to the extent that the Rabbis were intent upon characterizing God, it was precisely in order to make Him more of a God whom they could worship. The advantage of viewing God as a character is both methodological and substantive: it opens up a new perspective from which to consider an old question?namely, how the Rabbis represent God in their literature?and it promises as well to make visible, from this perspective, new aspects of the rabbinic representation. Let me suggest one example of the kind of promise that this new perspective holds. When literary theorists speak about character, they tend to discuss it in either essentialist or nominalist terms.24 According to the former view, character is the product of an essence?say, a personality, or a "view" of God, for example. According to the latter, in contrast, character is really only a name, a moniker for a locus of functions that a given figure serves in a narrative; aside from its function, the figure does not have an independent existence or identity. Now which of the two conceptions of character more accurately applies to the rabbinic represen tation of God? Did the Rabbis possess a coherent sense of God, a theological conception of His nature, or even a number of such concep tions, which they then brought to their various depictions of His behavior and deeds? Or were their portraits of God actually functions of the context in which they appeared, determined more by ad hoc, occasional exigencies, exegetical requirements, and particular ideological desires? Needless to say, an answer to these questions would contribute greatly to our understanding of the Rabbis. And while my own remarks</page><page sequence="8">158 DAVID STERN on the questions will hardly be conclusive,! wish in this essay to explore and test them out if only to suggest the kinds of contributions that literary studies can make to our knowledge of rabbinic theology As an example of the rabbinic characterization of God, I have selected one exceptional text that I will analyze in detail. This text is unique both in its length and for the completeness of its portrayals of God. Preserved as part of the twenty-fourth petihta, or proem, to Eikhah Rabbah, the classical Amorale midrashic collection on the Book of Lamentations, the text actually consists of two separate narratives, which the anonymous editor of the petihta appears to have joined together because they share a common subject, God's behavior in the aftermath of the Destruction of the Second Temple.25 The separateness of the narratives is, however, quite evident. In the first place, while the second of the two narratives is attributed to a named sage, R. Samuel b. Nahman, the first one is anonymous. Moreover, the attentive reader will immediately recognize a logical disjunction precisely at the point where the two narratives are joined. Finally, and most tellingly, each of the narratives represents God as having a person ality so unlike the other that they are virtual opposites. The God in each narrative is an entirely distinct character. And as a result, this text offers a perfect opportunity for exploring the question not only of character but of alternative modes of characterization as well?how different representa tions may be connected and what may be their place in the overall rabbinic scheme of things. In its entirety, Petihta 24 consists of a lengthy exegesis of Isa. 22:1-12; the narrative section we will treat is found at its very conclusion, and comprises the third interpretation given in the petihta for Isa. 22:12, "The Lord God of Hosts summoned on that day to weeping and lamenting, to tonsuring and girding with sackcloth." For the full text of the narrative, the reader is referred either to the Hebrew original of the petihta, most easily found in Buber's edition of Eikhah Rabbah, or to an English translation.26 Here I will only summarize the text as I analyze it. The first of the two narratives begins by telling us that when God initially sought to destroy the Temple, He realized that so long as He was inside the building, His presence protected it. In order to allow the Gentiles to destroy the Temple, God had to remove Himself. He therefore swore not to live in the Temple27 until the final redemption. Immediately, the Gentiles invaded the building and destroyed it. In this beginning God is trapped, as it were, by the conflicting requirements of His divine powers. Although He wishes to destroy the Temple, His own presence stands in the way, curtailing His freedom to act.28 To be sure, the notion that God withdrew from the Temple at the time of Destruction is not original to rabbinic aggadah. The idea is</page><page sequence="9">The Character(s) of God in Rabbinic Literature 159 suggested in the Bible, specifically in Ezekiel 9-11, and it is a motif found in ancient Near Eastern epic and lament, sources that may in some way have influenced the rabbinic aggadah.29 But where our narrative differs from these earlier sources is in how it represents the motif of withdrawal as a kind of paradox of the divine being, a paradox of God's literal situation, His presence in the Temple. That location, God's concrete site, is repeatedly emphasized in the narrative's language. He is described as being genuinely inside the Temple. He then takes an oath not to live there in the future, and He swears to it "by His right hand," an anthropomor phism whose "veracity" is reemphasized by a midrashic exegesis of Lam. 2:3. And when God finally removes His presence, the Shekhinah, from the Temple, He does so in order to return to His original home?a claim, again, explicitly confirmed to be "true" through a verse. The term Shekhinah itself refers in rabbinic Judaism to that aspect of God which is closest?most proximate, both spatially and spiritually?to mankind. Accordingly, most modern commentators explain the motif of the Shekhinah's withdrawal from the Temple as a figure for the exile that God Himself underwent with His people in divine sympathy for their plight.30 Yet as a symbol of God's immanence in the world, the Shekhinah is also an inherently anthropomorphic figure. In fact, its anthropomor phism is precisely the key to the ironic function that the Shekhinah plays at this exact moment in our narrative when God releases it?His presence?from its dwelling-place in the Temple. For while one might expect the divine presence, once freed from its earthly home, to be freed as well from the travails and sorrows of human existence, in our narrative it is precisely from this moment on that God becomes truly engulfed in the figures of anthropomorphism. From the moment He leaves the Temple, He finds Himself hopelessly entrapped in the pathos of human existence, and in its most mortal shapes: in grief, failure, frailty, senecti tude, the presentiment of death. These confused emotions, all of them the destiny of mankind, suc cessively visit God as the narrative now charts His descent into the depths of mourning. Immediately after He has withdrawn Hb presence from the Temple, God wakes up to the horrible reality of what has happened?but without, it seems, recognizing His own role in the catas trophe. "What have I done?" He asks Himself. Then, in a series of virtual non sequiturs, He turns angrily upon the Israelite victims of the Destruction?blaming them, first for their sins, then for forcing Him to punish them, and finally, as though acknowledging His deepest fear, for giving the Gentiles an opportunity to mock and ridicule Him. At this point, the archangel Metatron leaps before God and offers to weep in His stead; presumably, the archangel, who serves the role of defending the divine majesty, feels that human emotions are beneath God's honor.31 But the actual effect of the angel's offer to God is to ironize</page><page sequence="10">160 DAVID STERN God's own peculiar situation. For He refuses to yield to the angel's request. Instead, He insists upon His freedom to weep when and where He pleases. Yet God must still persuade the angel to leave Him, and to do so, He has to threaten Metatron by naming a specific place to which He can withdraw where the angel cannot enter; the veracity of this "fact" is again confirmed by a verse. Following this odd exchange, God's behavior shifts abruptly at almost every other moment. He seems constantly on the verge of losing control, of being unable to decide how He feels. After dismissing Metatron, the first thing God does is to order the other angels to go with Him to the Temple to see what the enemy has done?again, as if He does not already know. The moment God beholds the Temple's ruins, He breaks into lament. But these laments essentially bewail His losses, His helplessness, His failure to prevent the Destruction. "What shall I do for you?" He asks the victims, the Jews whom He could not save because (He pointedly tells them) they refused to heed His warnings and repent. Immediately afterward, God turns to the prophet Jeremiah (who now appears in the narrative without explanation) and accuses him of failing to show compassion for His plight. This confrontation marks the begin ning of God's transformation into both victim and mourner, into the victimized mourner. In one of the narrative's most poignant scenes, God uses the language of the mashal, the rabbinic parable, to liken Himself to a man who built a wedding-chamber for his only son; alas, the son died inside the chamber. The message of this quasi-parable is clear: the son represents Israel, the father is God, and the analogy's function is to elicit consolation and commiseration for God. God, however, will not settle for consolation. He refuses it. He insists on not putting away His grief. His need for consolation is unrequitable. Indeed, He is so distraught that He dismisses Jeremiah impatiently, ordering the prophet to summon the patriarchs and Moses because "they"?unlike Jeremiah?"know how to weep." And then, after an intricate account describing how Jeremiah finally succeeds in locating the patriarchs, all four ancestors?Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses?join God in lamenting. In a moment of supreme anthropomorphic imagery, the narrative reaches its climactic conclusion: As soon as the Holy One, blessed be He, saw [Moses and the patriarchs], then immediately "The Lord God of Hosts summmoned on that day to weeping and lamenting, to tonsuring and girding with sackcloth" (Isa. 22:12). If it were not explicitly written in Scripture it would be impossible to say it. They went weeping from one gate to the next, like a man whose deceased kin still lies before him, and the Holy One, blessed be He, lamented, saying: "Woe to that king who triumphed in his youth and who failed in his old age." The rhetorical complexity of this concluding passage is worth analyzing in detail. What plunges God into full-fledged mourning is the sight of the</page><page sequence="11">The Character(s) of God in Rabbinic Literature 161 patriarchs and Moses, the human figures in mourning. The quotation from Isa. 22:12 is taken literally, as it were, to prove that God actually did call to mourning, and this interpretation is affirmed by the narrator's gloss, a kind of formulaic qualification whose import is to say that the preceding statement would be unspeakable if Scripture itself had not spoken it. But far from diminishing the force of the anthropomorphism, the effect of the formula is to heighten it, to call attention to the verse's literal sense, and this effect is further strengthened by the simile that the text next invokes to describe God. Yet this simile is even more audacious in anthropomorphic terms than the scriptural verse itself. The phrase "like a man whose deceased kin still lies before him" refers specifically to the onein, the newly bereaved mourner who has not even had time to bury his deceased relative.32 According to the halakhah, aninut, the state of being an onein, is the most terrible grief a person can suffer; the onein is considered to be so bereft, so shaken by his loss, that he is not required to pray or to observe the positive commandments of the Law. The figure of the onein suggests how God was shaken to His very roots by the Destruction; it conveys the degree to which He was unable to assimilate the catastrophe, to absorb the horror of the tragedy in all its reality. And as if the simile were still not sufficient, the narrative con cludes with an astounding confession made by God Himself: "Woe to the king who triumphed (hitsliah) in his youth and who failed (lo hitsliah, literally, "did not triumph") in his old age!" Precisely because God is its speaker, this confession cannot be dis missed as being merely figurative. And yet the anthropomorphism in the confession is hardly to be taken solely on the literal level, as a proposi tional statement about the divine ontology since, after all, God only likens Himself to a human king. What the statement really accomplishes is to return us to the basic ambiguity underlying all anthropomorphic asser tions. For its meaning is surely that God "feels" His old age, whatever that can possibly mean, and that to express that feeling, the author of this narrative had no recourse except to draw upon the imagery of human feeling. Yet what is so bold about the narrative at this point is that it is not the narrator who describes God anthropomorphically, but God Himself. He adapts the language of anthromorphism because, stricken by the griefs of humankind, He too has no other language in which to express His human, all-too-human, predicament. The narrative we have just analyzed began with God withdrawing from the Temple in order to enable its destruction; it ended with God departing the Temple a second time, but now in mourning over that very same destruction. If God begins by mourning the Destruction's human victims, He ends up mourning Himself, His own failure. Indeed, by the</page><page sequence="12">162 DAVID STERN narrative's conclusion, the character of God has so completely identified Himself with the Destruction that He has nearly shut out its human victims. If the character of God in the first narrative is therefore represented in terms of His "closeness" to the Destruction?a closeness that, going beyond empathetic sharing, verges upon virtual solipsism?then the mode of His characterization in the second narrative can be formulated in terms of distance and remove. In this second narrative, which is a conflation of three separate sources, God is consistently represented as an essentially absent figure?absent, that is, even when He is literally present. He is removed, utterly distant from the narrative's human characters in a way He never is in the first narrative. Where the latter ended with God Himself leading the patriarchs and angels in mourning over the Destruction, the second narrative opens with Abraham and the angelic host lamenting the Destruction while God sits nearby absolutely oblivious to the scene of lamentation taking place right before Him! And when God finally does take notice of the scene, it is only to ask the angels why and what they are lamenting! After this, Abraham asks God why He has inflicted so terrible a punishment upon the people of Israel, and God replies matter-of-factly that Israel deserved its punishment on account of its sins. In His reply, it is worth noting, there is not a hint in God's voice of any concern for the Jews, let alone pain or compassion.33 At this point, the narrative turns into a trial in which God, acting simultaneously as judge and prosecutor, calls witnesses to testify to Israel's transgressions. The first witness is the Torah, and she is followed by the successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Abraham, however, manages to dissuade each witness from testifying until, finally, God has no one to call. In the next section of the narrative, the three patriarchs and Moses appeal to God to show mercy to Israel. Each figure cites the great deeds he performed in the past as merits for Israel's sake, but their pleas are all to no avail. God remains silent, utterly impassive, unmoved; and as the narrative proceeds, plea by plea, with no response from God, His obduracy and lack of feeling become almost painful to observe. The sense of His absence is palpable as well to the other characters in the narrative?the human characters?and so Moses, as though he knows God will do nothing, decides to go with Jeremiah to visit the Jews in exile so that someone might at least offer them consolation. Initially, in fact, Moses appears determined to redeem the Jews by himself, but a Heavenly Voice stops him by announcing that the Jews' punishment and their exile are divine decrees. This Heavenly Voice is the single audible token of divine intervention in this world to be recorded in the entire second narrative.</page><page sequence="13">The Character(s) of God in Rabbinic Literature 163 After returning to the patriarchs, Moses addresses a series of laments: to the sun, the Temple, the gentile enemy. Addressing the last group, he implores them not to be unnecessarily cruel to their Jewish victims; yet, as the narrator grimly reminds us, the Babylonians did not heed Moses' request. Only at this point does Moses finally address God directly. But his speech is now a complaint against God's behavior. How, Moses asks, could God have remained silent while the Gentiles slaughtered Jewish children in the presence of their mothers when God Himself, in the Torah, in Lev. 22:28, had forbidden Jews to kill animals this way? God has acted contrary to His own law.34 Yet even to this complaint God makes no reply. Finally, in the last section of the narrative, after all the male figures in Israel's past have failed to move God, the matriarch Rachel rises on Israel's behalf. Like the patriarchs who preceded her, Rachel invokes her past deeds; yet unlike them, she recounts one deed of hers that was less famously exemplary. Rachel tells God the story of how she conquered her jealousy when she went along with her conniving father Laban in tricking Jacob on their intended wedding night by helping her sister Leah take her place in Jacob's bed and thus become his wife. Why did she do this? In order, she tells God, to prevent Leah from being disgraced and shamed. Yet how, Rachel demands from God, can He let His jealousy which is solely jealousy of idols, prevent Him from showing compassion to the people of Israel? How can such petty jealousy on His part justify Israel's great shame and national disgrace? Amazingly, this argument succeeds in moving God. Yielding to Rachel, He agrees to show mercy to Israel, and then He promises to restore them. This promise is confirmed by Jer. 31:15-17, the two verses with which the passage concludes. This climactic scene is no doubt the most powerful in the entire text. And surely what is so powerful and moving about it is the sight of God yielding to Rachel, of His masculine hardness submitting to the compas sionate softness of the matriarch's plea; indeed, it would be tempting to interpret this scene, with its wholly unanticipated change in God's heart, as testimony to the emergence of a feminine presence within God him self.35 The opposite, however, is the case. Once again, we can observe the narrative reverting to the anthropomorphic paradox. For Rachel's femi ninity does possess a symbolic meaning: it epitomizes humanity, while God's utter masculinity is the sign of divinity. By allowing Himself to be persuaded by a female's argument, God does not Himself become femi nine. Rather, in an ironic reversal of imitatio dei that we might call imitatio hominis, it is the model of human behavior to which God now turns in submitting to Rachel's example. Through her acknowledgment of her own human jealousy, God is now able to acknowledge His own and offer to extend mercy to Israel.</page><page sequence="14">164 DAVID STERN The notion of imitatio hominis has parallels elsewhere in rabbinic literature, even in Eikhah Rabbah itself.36 In this narrative, however, God's imitation of human behavior represents more than an anthropo morphic trope writ large. It also implies a devastating critique of God's past deeds. For His wrath, we now learn, has been fueled by jealousy, by envy of idols; and yet, as Rachel reminds God, idols do not even possess "substance." God, in His own words, has been jealous of literally nothing, and Israel has accordingly suffered on account of literally nothing. And when God finally acknowledges His pettiness and puts aside His anger, the sole motive for this change of heart seems to be shame at being found out to be so petty, not real concern or compassion for the Jews' plight. The character of God presented in this second narrative is therefore the virtual opposite to the God in the first narrative. This God is characterized by a stony, disturbingly cold detachment from His nation and its travails. In contrast to the God of the first narrative, whose personal identification with the Destruction was nearly total, this God is entirely indifferent to the sufferings of his nation. Indeed, it is hard to think of two characters more different than these two Gods. All they seem to share in common is a name. What can we make of these two characters of God? And what is their relationship to each other? As I proposed earlier, the literary concept of character can be considered in either essentialist or nominalist terms. Which of these is more helpful in understanding our two characteriza tions? Do their anthropomorphic portraits of God derive from a precon ceived theological "view" or a preconception of His "psyche" (the latter term itself a vast anthropomorphism)? Or are the traits of God's personalities in the two narratives functions of the roles He is made to serve in each narrative, the products of local pressures (exegetical, ideo logical, etc.) and their requirements? We can begin from the essentialist perspective. First of all, it is clear from the fact that the two narratives present full-blown yet diametri cally opposed characterizations of God, each of which can stand alone, that there could not be a single "essence"?^either conceptual or psychological?from which both characterizations directly derived. On the other hand, as students of rabbinic thought know, the Rabbis' concept of God is typically presented in terms of binary features?the pairs of justice and mercy, or transcendence and immanence, for example. Might one of these pairs have been the model for our two characterizations? Justice and mercy, as represented in the two Attributes, middat hadin and middat harahamim, would at first appear to be the most likely candidates.37 But neither of the two Attributes truly represents an appro priate category for either characterization. For one thing, our two charac</page><page sequence="15">The Character(s) of God in Rabbinic Literature 165 ters of God are more like caricatures of Justice and Mercy than true personifications of the abstract principles. Moreover, the two middot, as attributes of the divine being, derive their real meaning from their struggle within God. While the middat hadin on occasion attains the status of a hypostasis?we will look at one such occasion shortly?as the infamous qateigor, the satan-like prosecutor of Israel, the Attributes as a pair are rarely fully independent beings. Similarly, the two divine characterizations are far from being personi fications of God's transcendence or immanence. These are the categories that E. E. Urbach, in his magisterial presentation in The Sages, uses to define the rabbinic God who, according to Urbach, oscillates between the opposite poles of absolute otherness, on the one side, and closeness to mankind, on the other.38 In Urbach's view, the Rabbis, insistent that God not be identified with nature or with the phenomenal world and yet equally determined to maintain His providential connectedness with this world, walked a kind of tightrope between the two poles. And along this tightrope, anthropomorphism was a corollary of the Rabbis' desire to uphold the side of immanence. By representing God in human-like features, they affirmed His abiding concern with the world of humanity It is certainly true that the attributes of transcendence and immanence both play into the two characterizations we have analyzed. And yet, the abstract attributes do not really explain the precise features of the two characters that emerge in the narratives, or their genesis. For what distinguishes those characterizations?what makes them into viable characters?is not their transcendence or immanence but their human like behavior in all its unpredictability and strangeness. That behavior, the core of the anthropomorphic impulse in each narrative, is not a functional device or strategy serving a higher purpose, as Urbach maintains, but the characters' very mode of representation, even self-representation, as when, in each narrative, God Himself undertakes to imitate human behavior, to adapt the anthropomorphic turn Himself. In each of these cases, God's intention is not to demonstrate His abiding concern with mankind. He imitates human behavior because He has no other satisfac tory model. Our two divine characters do not obviously derive, then, from either of these pairs of accepted theological categories for the rabbinic God. But might the characters be the products of a more specific, local need, an exegetical impulse, for example? In our text this is unfortunately not the case. For while the two narratives both use scriptural verses to prove their anthropomorphic claims at different points, the narratives themselves do not seem to be exegetical artifacts. On the other hand, it is certainly fair to suggest that the extreme nature of the two characterizations of God?the very feature that all but makes them both into caricatures?may very well have derived from the equally extreme, radically catastrophic, nature of</page><page sequence="16">166 DAVID STERN the historical event that serves as their backdrop and overall context, namely, the Destruction of the Temple. Each portrait of God relates in some way to what must have been the two deepest feelings Jews felt in the aftermath of the Destruction?extreme guilt, on the one hand (as though the catastrophe had been entirely deserved on account of their great sins), and extreme self-pity, on the other (as though the catastrophe had been wholly undeserved, since it far exceeded any transgression they could have committed to warrant such punishment). The pressures exerted by these feelings may help us to understand the tone of near-desperation that lies behind both narratives. That tone also points to a common mythical quality that both narratives, for all their differences, share in the way they represent God. The same quality is paralleled in other rabbinic passages that portray God. Consider, for example, the following section from Genesis Rabbah 8:3. The passage is taken from a lengthy series of interpretations all of which are devoted to the problematic phrase in Gen. 1:26, "And God said, 'Let us make man ...'." One question that this verse posed for many ancient exegetes was, Whom did God consult when He said, "Let us ..."? The following are two answers offered in the midrash. R Berechiah said: When the Holy One, blessed be He, was about to create Adam, He foresaw that both righteous and wicked descendants would issue forth from him. He said: If I create him, then wicked men will come forth from him. But if I don't create him, how will the righteous come into existence? So what did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He removed the ways of the wicked from before Him, and joined with the Attribute of Mercy, and created man. This is what the verse [means]: "For the Lord cherishes the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish (toxteid)" (Ps. 1:6) What does t?veid mean? He made it perish (ibedah) from before Him, and joined with the Attribute of Mercy (middat raljamim), and created man. R rjanina did not say thus, but: When the Holy One, blessed be He, was about to create Adam, He took counsel with the ministering angels. They asked Him: What is [man's] character? He answered: Righteous men will issue forth from him. That is what the verse [means:] "For the Lord cherishes (yodei'a, literally "knows") the way of the righteous" (Ps. 1:6)?[this means:] God made known (hodi'a) the way of the righteous to the ministering angels. "... but the way of the wicked will perish (t?veid)" (Ps. 1:6)?[this means:] He made it perish from before them. He revealed to the angels that the righteous would issue from Adam, but He did not reveal to them that the wicked would issue forth as well. For if He had revealed to them that the wicked would issue forth from him, the Attribute of Justice (middat hadin) would not have allowed him to be created. The first thing to note about this passage is that what looks like a real exchange in it between two sages, R. Berechiah and R. IJanina, is actually an editorial invention: R. IJanina, a first-generation Amorah, could never have actually responded to R. Berechiah, a sage who lived some four</page><page sequence="17">The Character(s) of God in Rabbinic Literature 167 generations later.39 Still, what R. IJanina would have found objectionable in R. Berechiah's interpretation is the idea that God created man with a partner, even one so closely identified with Him as the Attribute of Mercy. The major difference between this initial interpretation and R. Hanina's alternative is that in the latter, God creates man entirely by Himself; whomever He consulted, He did it before He actually created man. Therefore, when the verse says, "Let us make man . .." it must refer to that merely preliminary consultation. The source of R. Hanina's discomfort with his colleague's interpreta tion is doubtless his fear that somone might use the verse to prove (from the Bible!) the existence of a second divinity in heaven, either a Logos-like hypostasis or a Gnostic demiourgos. R. lianina's own interpretation effec tively rules out that possibility. Yet it is worth considering the "price" he must pay to accomplish this ideological end?that is, the representational price in characterizing God. For if lianina is terrified of the possibility that someone might discover a second divinity in the Torah, he has absolutely no theological qualms about anthropomorphizing God's behavior. True, even in R. Berechiah's interpretation, there is a nascent anthro pomorphism present in the motif of God putting aside His knowledge (of the eventual existence of the wicked) from Himself (literally, "from before His face") so as to be able to create man. In IJanina's opinion, however, this anthropomorphic conceit is blown up into a full trait of character. For according to IJanina, God does not simply hide His knowledge from Himself. He acts deceptively. He conceals what He knows from the angels. And why? Because He knows that the Attribute of Justice, if it knew the whole truth, "would not have allowed Him to create man." Aside from the fact that the Attribute of Justice appears here as a full fledged hypostasis, as a being virtually distinct from God?precisely the kind of presence IJanina wished to exclude from the verse's interpretation?the Attribute is now a figure who appears to be more powerful than God Himself. As a character in its own right, the Attribute resembles the mythological Moira or Fate whose decrees even the gods cannot overrule. For good reason God is afraid, and feels that He must hide His knowledge from the Attribute, and create man on the sly. There are, to be sure, any number of logical and theological objections one might pose to this narrative (and, for that matter, to Berechiah's interpretation as well). How can God hide something from Himself? How can He hide something from the Attribute of Justice if it is so powerful? And if it is so powerful, how can it not know what God knows? Besides, what good is hiding the knowledge? Will it not eventually come out? These are all good theological questions, but they are somehow not really relevant to understanding the narrative, precisely because its meaning rests not upon logical or theological consistency but upon the force of its</page><page sequence="18">168 DAVID STERN characterization of God. And as in our Eikhah Rabbah text, what makes this characterization of God so compelling is its felt interiority, the sense it gives of possessing a recognizable psyche. In the case of these two narrative-interpretations for Gen. 1:26, can we say what the model for God's character or psyche might be? In part, as we have seen, the impetus for the characterization is exegetical, a combina tion of the textual and ideological difficulties posed by the problematic phrase in Gen. 1:26. In addition, though, Hanina's portrayal of God, like that of the king in the rabbinic mashal, appears to be modeled upon the figure of the Roman emperor (or of one of his representatives in Palestine). But this king is hardly the kosmokrator, an unperturbed, omnipotent, wholly just world-ruler. Rather, he is a beleaguered, often browbeaten figure, possessed of absolute power but either corrupted by that power or unsure as to how to use it confidently, afraid of his very own counselors and subordinates (like Metatron or the middat hadin or the angels, who are sometimes more like a bunch of insubordinate Sejanus like conspirators than loyal freedmen, God's familia). This king, in other words, is not so much ruler as ruled?by the imperial bureaucracy, by his anxieties about losing power, by his own fears.40 The same model also seems to lie partly behind the tragic, solipsistic character of the defeated God in the lengthy first narrative from Eikhah Rabbah, and perhaps even behind the heartless despot of the second narrative. For even the latter turns out in the end to be not quite the truly imperious ruler He would like to imagine Himself. After all, Rachel persuades Him to change His mind by forcing Him to recognize His "justice" for what it really is? vanity and petty jealousy. The recognition of this imperial model for the Rabbis' portrait of God is significant for several reasons. First, it suggests how deeply rooted in history, in the Rabbis' own historical moment, was their construction of God. Of course, the representation of God as king was in no way an innovation of the Rabbis; the image of God as king has a venerable history going back to the earliest texts of ancient Near Eastern literature, and it is already a virtual clich? in the Bible.41 Yet if it is not surprising that the Rabbis should have chosen this conventional figure for power and sovereignty as their symbolic figure for God, it is revealing that the actual model they selected should have been one so insecure and unconfident in his ability to exercise the power at his disposal. In portraying God in the image of this king, the Rabbis were surely mirroring their own feelings of insecurity, their own self-conscious powerlessness in the world, and their anger and resentment at the earthly powers who controlled their this worldly existence. The Rabbis' God, in other words, was for them no refuge from the world. He was too much like that world. In light of their common roots in this imperial model, the differences between the two characters of God portrayed in the Eikhah Rabbah</page><page sequence="19">The Character(s) of God in Rabbinic Literature 169 proem may also seem somewhat less pronounced. The imperial model certainly does not explain those differences. And quite obviously the imperial model was also not the only model the Rabbis used to construct divinity; indeed, what is needed in the future is an inventory of all the characterizations of God to be found in rabbinic literature, from the God of Mercy to God the trickster. Only with such an inventory in hand could we determine if the two characterizations of God in Eikhah Rabbah are truly exceptional, or whether they are representative portraits, or merely two types along a spectrum of divine characterizations. But if we return to our earlier terminology, we can say that, while the imperial model points to an essentialist approach to character, the specific features of the separate portrayals of God in the two narratives will require the nominal ist approach to explain them by concentrating more upon the functions and roles that each divinity is called upon to play in its respective narrative. It is impossible to understand these characters outside their narratives (just as it is impossible to imagine one character of God appearing in the other's narrative: the God of the first narrative acting as the judge in the trial in the second narrative, or the second God bemoan ing His tribulation in words like "I succeeded in my youth and failed in my old age." Each character is fully rooted in its own story). The anthropomorphic construction of God is always a presence within a narrative or a larger aggadah (even if those narratives and aggadot are preserved only in fragments). As a character, God hardly ever appears in rabbinic literature in isolation, as the object of independent discourse. He is always doing something, always part of some story in which He plays some function, some role. This last point may, finally, help us reconsider a question raised earlier in this essay, the question of the Rabbis' beliefs about God. If God is a character whose meaning cannot be discussed apart from the narra tives in which He appears, then the question, What did the Rabbis believe when they depicted God anthropomorphically? also cannot be answered without asking, What did the Rabbis believe about their aggadot? Did they believe they were historically veracious, that they occurred as narrated? Did they believe not only that God actually possessed the anthropomorphic features attributed to Him in the aggadot but all the other details and incidents in these narratives as well? When they described God sitting in judgment in heaven (as in the second Eikhah Rabbah narrative), they surely had no difficulty in believing that the patriarchs and matriarchs were there as well, pleading for Israel before God. But did they equally believe that the Torah and its letters also spoke and acted like persons, refusing to testify against Israel, as the aggadah says they did? Far more so than biblical narrative, rabbinic aggadah resembles ancient Greco-Roman myth, a tradition that remained very much alive in</page><page sequence="20">170 DAVID STERN late antiquity as was that of aggadah itself.42 Consequently, the question, Did the Rabbis believe in their aggadot? is not very different from asking, Did the Greeks believe in their myths? And precisely this question, in a book with that title, has been asked by the French classicist, Paul Veyne.43 The general subjects of Veyne's book are Greek and Roman authors from Herodotus on, but Veyne's real concern is with late antique figures like the second-century c.e. traveler and geographer Pausanias. In his accounts of various localities and their cults, Pausanias, as Veyne notes, simultaneously seems to be skeptical of the traditional myths and yet willing to entertain them as possessing some kind of truth. For Veyne, Pausanias' position personifies the ancients' dilemma of belief: The Greeks believe and do not believe in their myths. They believe in them, but they use them and cease believing at the point where their interest in believing ends. It should be added in their defense that their bad faith resided in their belief rather than in their ulterior motives. Myth was nothing more than a superstition of the half-literate, which the learned called into question. The co-existence of contradictory truths in the same mind is nonetheless a universal fact.44 To be sure, the Rabbis never exhibit precisely the same kind of skepticism about aggadah as do writers like Pausanias (though there are exchanges such as the famous one between Akiba and Eleazar ben Azariah over the singular "frog" in Exod. 8:2 [Exodus Rabbah 10:4] that suggest that a line existed separating the credible from the incredible). But what is most valuable about Veyne's approach to the question of ancient belief is less the direct connection of myth to aggadah than the grounds for belief in myth that Veyne attempts to establish. According to Veyne, myths tend to be, first of all, anonymous; this is frequently true of aggadah (and even when a given aggadah is attributed, inasmuch as aggadah in general represents an oral tradition). Second, they repeat what was said: "When it comes to gods and heroes, the only source of knowledge is the 'they say,' and this source has a mysterious authority."45 That authority is not unlike the authority of Scripture as it is invoked by exegetes in aggadah, most obviously when a text records "as it is written," but perhaps even more so in such expressions as "If Scripture did not say it, it would be impossible to believe." Far from being an apology for anthropomorphism, as the expression is generally under stood, it may actuaUy be seen as an appeal to authority in order to gain credibility. Third, and most important, there is what Veyne calls the sense of a "time of myths," of a "mythological space and time ... secretly different from our own." As Veyne astutely describes this sense: A Greek put the gods "in heaven," but he would have been astounded to see them in the sky. He would have been no less astounded, if someone, using time in its literal sense, told him that Hephaestus had just remarried or that</page><page sequence="21">The Character(s) of God in Rabbinic Literature 171 Athena had aged a great deal lately. Then he would have realized that in his own eyes mythic time had only a vague analogy with daily temporality; he would also have thought that a kind of lethargy had always kept him from recognizing this difference.46 One could easily identify an analogous "aggadic time and space," differ ent not only from our own time, but from that in which the Rabbis themselves lived. For the most part, that aggadic time and space would have been coeval with the world of the biblical past?a distant, self encapsulated past for the Rabbis?but it may very well have included the entire period of the Temple's existence, right up until the Destruction, the event that for the Rabbis was the true historical watershed, the time when earlier history ended and their own began (and the time precisely when the two narratives in Eikhah Rabbah are said to transpire).47 Yet when ever exactly it ended, the time and space of aggadah, like that of myth, encompassed a world in which God acted and behaved anthropomor phically, just like a person. But if someone had asked the Rabbis if God were indeed a person like themselves, they surely would have responded that the personhood of God bore only the vaguest analogy to personhood in their world as they knew it in their daily lives. This is probably as close as we will ever come to knowing what the Rabbis believed. There is no reason for us, the Rabbis' modern readers, to believe more or less than they did.

The "essentialist" position is best represented in the critical tradition that goes from Henry James through E. M. Forster to Wayne Booth and much psychoanalytic criticism. By the nominalist tradition I mean mainly structuralist approaches to narrative from Propp through Greimas and Barthes. I wish to thank Alan Mintz for pointing out to me this basic dichotomy in critical thinking about character. 25. The passage in its entirety with both narratives, is found only in manuscripts of the Sephardic recension of Eikhah Rabbah. Most manuscripts of the Ashkenazic recension, including British Museum 27089, which Buber used for his edition of the petihta'ot, lack both the second and the third interpretations of Isa. 22:12; cf. Buber, p. 25 notes 15 and 16. In addition, two briefer versions of the passage are found in Midrash Eikhah Zuta (in Midrash Zuta, ed. S. Buber, Vilna, 1894), pp. 71-74 (found also in Yalkut Shimeoni, Eikha 4); and 142-44. Both these versions have only the first narrative and part of the second, but not its beginning or end. I wish to express my gratitude to Paul Mandel for sharing with me his work on the recensions and the versions of this petihta. Unfortunately, nothing is known about the narratives' background; the only other rabbinic narrative similar in style and language that I know of is the lengthy aggadah about the death of Moses in Tanhuma, Va'ethanan (ed. Buber, Deut, pp. 10-14), which uses some of our text's same unusual expressions and motifs. 26.

Hebrew: shelo ezaqeq lo; for my translation, see Genesis Rabbah 20:7, and Jastrow, 410. 28. Note that in the text, it is only after the Destruction that God is said actually to remove His presence, the Shekhinah, and return to heaven; the present text probably reflects a conflation of two motifs?the first, the impossibility for the Temple to be destroyed as long as the divine presence protects it; the second, the departure of the Shekhinah as a sign of the Destruction that has occurred. The conflation is slightly uneasy, and produces the nascent contradiction I have noted. 29. On the motif in the Bible, see Moshe Greenberg, Ezekiel, 2-20 (Garden City, N.Y., 1983), pp. 168-69, 200-2. On the ancient Near Eastern tradition, see in particular Piotr Michalowski, The Lamentation over the Destruction of Sumer and Mr, (Winona Lake, 1989), p. 45 (1.134); p. 49 (11.207-9); p. 53 (1.265); pp. 57-61 (11. 340-77); and the translation of the Tukulti Ninurta epic in Peter Machinist, "Literature as Politics: The Tukulti-Ninurta Epic and the Bible," Catholic Biblical Quarterly 38 (1976), 455-82; and for discussion of the motif, 462-64. The relationship between these texts and the Ezekiel chapters is noted by Greenberg, pp. 200-1, but no one, to my knowledge, has remarked upon their connection to the rabbinic narratives or upon the striking parallels between the two portraits of God in the aggadah and the portraits of the separate deities Nanna-Su'en and Enlil in the ancient texts. In her forthcoming book on ancient Near Eastern goddesses, T?kvah Frymer-Kensky associates the motif of divine departure with the figure of Zion in the Bible. 30. See Norman J. Cohen, "Shekhinta Ba-Galuta: A Midrashic Response to Destruction and Persecution," in JSJ13 (1982): 147-59; cf. as well the Yefei 'Anaf's comments, printed in the folio edition of Midrash Rabbah, pp. 6b-7a, suggesting that the character of God in the aggadah is actually a figure for the Community of Israel(!), and never intended to represent God Himself who, after all, could never possess the anthropopathic or anthropomorphic features ascribed to Him in the narrative! 31. On Metatron, see G.F. Moore, "Intermediaries in Jewish Thought," HTR 15 (1922), esp. pp. 62-85; Urbach, The Sages, p. 139; Gedaliahu G. Stroumsa, "Form(s) of God," pp. 287-88. 32. See M. Berakhot 3:1. 33. The same indifferent voice is preserved in two fragmented versions of the episode about God's meeting with Abraham in the Temple: see B. Menahot 53b and Eikhah Rabbah ad Lam. 1:1 (Buber, p. 56). Both versions preserve the same playful exegesis of Jer. 11:16.</page><page sequence="24">174 DAVID STERN 34. On the complaint as a genre, see my discussion in Parables in Midrash, pp. 130-45. 35. This case is argued in an important, as yet unpublished paper by Galit Hasan Rokem, who sees the fiugre of Rachel herself as a prototype of the feminine presence of God. Cf. Alan Mintz's remarks in Ifurban, p. 59, where he too attempts to distinguish the different characters of God along gender lines. Attractive as the interpretation may be, there is in fact no evidence in this text (and hardly any support in any other rabbinic text) that the rabbinic God is ever anything but male. Moshe Idei's attempt in Kabbalah, pp. 128-36, to see a gender distinction and a sexualizat?on of God in the phrase du-partsufim as used in rabbinic literature is not convincing; his only real sources are either medieval-kabbalistic or Philonic, not rabbinic. I wish to thank Professor Elliot Wolfson for calling this last point to my attention. 36. See, for example, the long aggadah about God learning how to mourn from the angels, in Eikhah Rabbah 1:1 (Buber, pp. 42-43); and the two versions of the story of "the blood of Zechariah," in Eikhah Rabbah (Buber), pp. 148-49 (3:13) and pp. 21-22 (Proem 23), on which, see J. Heinemann, Aggadot vetoldoteihen (Jerusalem, 1974), pp. 31-38. 37. On the two principles, see E. E. Urbach, The Sages, trans. I. Abrahams (Jerusalem, 1975), pp. 448-61; cf. Idei, Kabbalah, pp. 128-36. 38. Urbach, The Sages, pp. 37-79; on the function of anthropomorphism, p. 38. 39. According to Bacher, this Haninah is Haninah b. Hama, a first-generation Amorah. R. Berechiah, the author of the preceding opinion, was a fifth-generation Amorah. This line is therefore an editorial gloss; one should not mistakenly believe that the Rabbis were actually in disagreement the way the sequence of the text implies. See Bacher, vol. 1, pt. 1, p. 32. 40. For another narrative of this sort, see Eikhah Rabbah 1:13 (Buber, pp. 75-76), translated and analyzed in Stern, Parables in Midrash, pp. 238-40. 41. Cf. Mark Z. Bret?er, God is King: Understanding an Israelite Metaphor (Sheffield, 1989). 42. Fox, Pagans and Christians (New York, 1987), pp. 93-94. 43.

Compare Maimonides' remark, in The Guide of the Perplexed, trans. S. Pines (Chicago, 1963), 1.46, p. 102: the doctrine of the corporeality of God did not ever occur even for a single day to the Sages, may their memory be blessed, and that this was not according to them a matter lending itself to imagination or confusion. For this reason you will find that in the whole of the Talmud and in all the Midrashim they keep to the external sense of the dicta of the prophets. This is so because of their knowledge that this matter is safe from confusion and that with regard to it no error is to be feared in any respect; all the dicta have to be considered as parables and as a guidance conducting the mind toward one being. 47. By the term "Destruction," I intend a partly mythical event including and trans urning the historical destructions of both the first and second Temples. The Rabbis themselves had already begun to collapse the two events into a single memory; thus it is difficult, and perhaps intentionally so, to determine which one of the two Destructions the narratives in Eikhah Rabbah refers to; except for one r?f?rence in the last half of the second narrative to the Jews exiled to Babylonia there is no other historical specification in the text.</page></plain_text>
