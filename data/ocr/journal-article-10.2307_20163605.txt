HAVE A confession to make: over a period of several weeks I saw eight Greeks plays in production on two continents and found myself?much to my surprise and dismay?thoroughly bored. I could not wait for Medea to get it over with and kill her</page><page sequence="2">Herbert Golder 175 children; I wanted Cassandra to march into the palace and die; I almost ran up on the stage and blinded Oedipus myself; as for Antigone, I'd have condemned her to death if Creon had not. Eight highly acclaimed productions of the Greeks and I felt, horribile dictu, as if I had seen all this before. I could not help wondering if we have lost the classics through the very conventions by which we classicize them. I realize that I am treading, like blind Oedipus, on holy ground here, especially in the case of Ariane Mnouchkine's Les Atrides, "the New York theatrical event of the year" whose aura long hovered over the city like a sacred shower of gold.2 Mnouchkine's artistic achievement?her brilliant and original fusion of Indian Kathakali dance, French neo-classical declama tory acting, and Japanese theatrical technique?was admittedly breathtaking.3 It is indeed hard to imagine we will see anything quite like her Oresteia in our lifetime, with so concentrated a sce nic conception and so consummately skillful a dramatic execu tion, so wide a range of expressive resources deployed by such disciplined and dedicated actors. Her acclaimed Libation Bear ers?arguably the most difficult Greek play to stage?was, at times, spellbinding. It was hard not to get caught up in the conta gion of bloodletting at the play's close, hard not to be moved by Orestes' and then the chorus's passionately vindictive victory dance.4 It was truly cathartic, but was so in part because the previ ous play, the Agamemnon, had been so stillborn. And if the truth be told, over the two-day, ten-hour, four-play period, I started to feel so oppressed by the problems plaguing this production that I found myself wondering, more so since Mnouchkine's is undeni ably a class act, about how and why we have lost the classics. After all, I am one of the converted?and neither a pedant nor a purist? and have come to her multicultural take on the Greeks with enthu siasm and high expectations. But I was bored and restless during most of the Agamemnon, much of the lphigenia, and even part of the celebrated Libation Bearers. How could this be, I kept asking myself? The week following Mnouchkine I went to London to see the Royal Shakespeare's Oedipus Trilogy at the Barbican and Euripi des' Medea with Diana Rigg at the Almeida. It was a nerve wracking flight: engine trouble over the Atlantic, combined with severe turbulence from an ominously proximate hurricane at sea. And a worse landing: there had been several IRA bombings the day before, one at Victoria Station in which someone was killed; for</page><page sequence="3">176 GEEK TRAGEDY??OR, WHY I'D RATHER GO TO THE MOVIES security reasons, trains were delayed or service suspended. On the tube, on the way to the theater that evening, I read the Times to get caught up with the world and could not get beyond the latest account of atrocities in Bosnia. So I walked into the Almeida with this question on my mind: Who is Medea to me or me to Medea that I should weep for her? I was also thinking about a remark of Joseph Papp's, one that should be an acid test for all productions of Greek tragedy and one to which I will return: the theater must be louder than life or it will be drowned out in the cacophony that surrounds it. On this partic ular evening the cacophony had gotten the best of me; by the time I took my seat my ears had gone quite deaf from it all. So I was waiting for a noise louder than any I had heard that day. I know the Medea; its register can reach this high. But this minimalist produc tion was not up to it. In fact, the whole thing struck me as wooden; Medea herself woodenly method, or methodically wooden, it was hard to tell?anguished behind clenched teeth in that peculiarly English way, emoting through the thorax and not the body, evinc ing a wit more verbal than visceral. What is it about the classics that they always seem so talky? And why is the alternative to end less prattle always convulsive sobbing? Here was yet another play about a victim, another wife beloved and betrayed (this was, as the politicians said, the year of the woman: three Clytemnestra plays at the Guthrie,5 Martha Graham's Clytemnestra in New York,6 Mnouchkine's Oresteia as the victimology of Clytemnestra7). But Medea as mere victim will not "cleave the general ear with horrid speech,/Make mad the guilty and appall the free,/Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed/The very faculties of eyes and ears." For no betrayal by a callous bastard like Jason is worth the lives of two innocent children. Why then does Medea kill them? This is the question that this cameo-style production, this star vehicle? with its wistful, sing-songy, and mostly unintelligible minimalist chorus of three lugubrious women?never raised. The following evening I saw the Royal Shakespeare's version of Sophocles' Theban plays. Now the archaic world of Aeschylus is nearly impenetrable to us today, so one is amazed by a production, like Mnouchkine's, that even partially succeeds in some important ways. And the most modern, even fractiously postmodern of the three tragedians, Euripides, is in many ways the most elusive, since he combines refined decadence of style with primitiveness of content, and since much of his power derives from a necessary</page><page sequence="4">Herbert Golder 177 familiarity with the traditions and conventions he skillfully sub verts. Sophocles, by contrast, is so monumental, his poetry and scenic forms so marmoreal, the struggles his characters enact so massive, like those of Michelangelo's statues or Shakespeare's heroes, that his mark is, at first sight, hard to miss. In truth his world and theater are light years away. When you think for a moment that four of his seven extant plays deal not so much with the death of the hero, but with the even more strangely significant issue of the hero's burial, that is, where his big dead body actually goes, you realize you are in a different universe from our own.8 The RSC production, however, was decidedly homegrown. Its declamatory, proscenium arch-style acting made Sophocles seem windy and dramatically unwieldy. An absence of Sophoclean visual poetry, his magnificent orchestration of powerful tableaux, against which his speeches are set, made them seem merely set pieces, and his theater like a henhouse of pseudo-Elizabethan fus tian and carnival barking?with as much talk as Shakespeare but none of his genuinely dramatic poetry. The poetry was conspicuously missing in this version, an origi nal translation by the playwright Timberlake Wertenbaker. And this production's classical (British) style of declamation consorted oddly with her prosodically flaccid prose. It was bad enough to witness supreme dramatic intelligences such as Oedipus and An tigone mouthed in a journeyman's plainspeak that effectively robbed even the dramatic action of any but the most prosaic of meanings, but when the chorus, whose members wore over their left shoulders (out of some pedantically uninspired notion of fidel ity) a strip of meander pattern (like that found on ancient Greek vases and now bordering placemats at Greek restaurants) marched in lockstep, assumed rectangular formations, turned forty-five degrees this way and that to punctuate strophe and antistrophe; when this chorus turned some of the most magnificent choral lyr ics in all Greek poetry into doggerel and patter songs, I wanted to scream.9 For this pastiche of Anglicized, colloquial classicism has nothing to do with Sophocles. Sophoclean scene painting is numi nous, granitic, and exact. His landscapes tremble with darkly divine and dreadful human truths. Thus an essential dimension of his dramatic vision is lost when, for example, the forbidden grove of the Eumenides is pruned of its awe and made to sound like an English park, or the holy and voracious earth that swallows Oedi pus is made to appear like a picture-postcard vignette. When the</page><page sequence="5">178 GEEK TRAGEDY??OR, WHY I'D RATHER GO TO THE MOVIES language did veer daringly toward the imagistic, it summoned bizarre apparitions: only in Aristophanes' parody of Aeschylean poetry from the Frogs can one find such unearthly hybrids as the "centipede sea nymphs" on which the second chorus of the Oedi pus ofColonus closed. But when the chorus transformed what are, in Greek, ravishing lyrics of transcendental feeling that express a desire to soar like a bird through the clouds and look down from above on suffering,10 to lyrics such as "I'd like to be a pigeon," I really thought I was losing my mind. No Aristophanes could have made Sophocles sound this risible. But "pigeon" is what they chanted. Were English pigeons so different from American pigeons as to become emblems of soaring transcendence? I went to the park the next morning to see, and trust me, they are the same filthy, grotty, disgusting, bottom-feeders we have in New York or Boston.11 It might seem pedantic to point out that Sophocles did not com pose Oedipus, Oedipus at Colonus, and Antigone as a continuous trilogy, as they are rendered in this production. But this eliding of differences is symptomatic of our tendency to assimilate to a con ception (whether traditional or contemporary) of the classics: here, that of the classicizing tendency to create a "classical tril ogy." In fact, Sophocles was the playwright who stopped compos ing thematically continuous trilogies and therefore introduced, as a matter of artistic style, the single play that could stand on its own. The last play in the so-called trilogy, the Antigone, happens to be a work of Sophocles' early maturity; the Oedipus at Colonus which here "precedes" Antigone was composed when Sophocles was in his nineties, when the prospects of the city of Athens had irrevocably changed, and when the playwright could be said to possess a very different sense of the world.12 True, Sophocles is still Sophocles, but the illusion that these plays make a seamless whole is achieved only by leveling their crucial stylistic, tonal, and thematic differences: would we put three concerti of Beethoven together and call it a symphony? Apart from the fact that these three plays deal with the ancestors of the Labdacids, they really have, as discrete works of art, very little to do with one another. In sum, the London experience made me all the more grateful for Mnouchkine's achievement, but at the same time it clarified for me where she too had gone generally wrong in her efforts to classi cize the classics.</page><page sequence="6">Herbert Golder 179 II. The other aspect of creating the "classical" trilogy where none actually exists is the impulse to contemporize, which each produc tion manifested in different ways. Mnouchkine, for example, found it necessary to revise Aeschylus by means of a Euripidean critique. By opening the Oresteia via Euripides' Iphigeneia in Aulis?that is, from the perspective of a moral universe radically removed from, even based upon the deep ironization of, Aeschy lus?our reception of Aeschylus' theater becomes so skewed that the complexity of his very different archaic vision must of neces sity be correspondingly oversimplified. Euripides' Iphigeneia in Aulis is a play about remote beginnings written to critique the end of the very era inaugurated by Aeschylus with such cosmic opti mism.13 The most striking result of this telescopic reversal is that we are attuned by Euripides to the victimization of Clytemnestra, who now becomes the center of the trilogy as she is not in Aeschy lus; and Aeschylus' own dangerously and disconcertingly andro gyne character, who with battle-ax in hand bars the way to culture, must be completely gutted from the text. Rough edges are smoothed. Clytemnestra's words upon discovering the return of Orestes, "Someone give me an ax to kill a man" becomes "my murderous ax, quick."14 Even at her most brutal we cannot erase her prostrate Euripidean figure from our minds.15 And Agamem non exists only as the cold unfeeling samurai of her Iphigeneia.16 The Agamemnon of Aeschylus, a colossus who, in his grand char iot entrance, literally pulls the lightning down from the sky onto his own head looked, with only his tiny head barely rising above his platform chariot in Mnouchkine's staging, more like a bobbing jack-in-the-box. This is not an exaggeration. Her Agamemnon appeared upon a box-shaped construction which was rolled out from behind the stage. Only Agamemnon's head and upper torso were visible above the front planks. A diminutive figure, his "grand" entrance became correspondingly comical. As I read Aeschylus (though of course we have no explicit stage directions), Agamemnon's grand and portentous chariot entrance marks him instantly as a man des tined to commit hybris, to outrage the gods, to overstep human limits. No doubt his chariot is gold; the number of his guards and retainers would further dramatize his importance, with Apollo's princess Cassandra in tow, possibly the most outrageous aspect of this outrageous entry. Every move he makes and word he utters</page><page sequence="7">18o GEEK TRAGEDY??OR, WHY I'D RATHER GO TO THE MOVIES betrays the transgressive spirit that defines him. But there was none of this in Mnouchkine's staging. A magnificent Agamemnon would have introduced a complexity that was not to her purpose. Not only did the grandeur of Agamemnon's entrance go, but also the purple carpet scene, arguably the most famous and spec tacular scenic moment of the Oresteia. Clytemnestra turns vixen and appealing to his fatal vanity seduces Agamemnon into walk ing upon sacred tapestries meant for the gods. The whole scene, as rendered here, was neutered. Clytemnestra argued more than seduced Agamemnon onto the carpets, which we never actually saw. One of the play's crucial visual emblems?simultaneously web of fate, divine splendor, and river of human blood?was left to our imagination.17 In fact, much of what is spectacular in Aeschylus was scanted, such as the real sense of Cassandra's shockingly profane hurling down of Apollo's sacred vestments, which should mortify us as might a striptease staged in a church. The archaic world and Aeschylean-scale drama have been down-sized to fit not only a vision18 (which is not in itself so bad) but what under closer scru tiny looks suspiciously like a mere style of theater. But then the Greeks are fair game (never mind that Aeschylus would turn over in his urn if he knew that he was on the same bill with Euripides19), and, given their cultural authority, powerful vehicles for contemporary issues.20 And besides, as Jonathan Miller once remarked of Shakespeare, "If I smear tar over Picasso's Guernica, I've destroyed a masterpiece. If I muck up Shakespeare I, not he, look like an ass. The text remains, and Shakespeare will survive."21 Shakespeare maybe, but about the Greeks we cannot be so sure, since our possession of them depends so heavily on their mediation by scholars, critics, translators, and directors. Few people any longer read the originals, which, after all, are nothing more than libretti for performance (minus the music, choreogra phy, and staging so essential to the Greek playwright's scenic art). It would be a tragedy indeed if the permanent relevance and crucial otherness, which is finally what makes these plays most valuable for us, were to be sacrificed away in the name of the trendy or the tried-and-true traditional. It may sound like I am advocating academic purism. I am not. My gravamen is against the conventions in which each of the three productions, mutatis mutandis, seemed embalmed. Almost every thing about the RSC Sophocles?apart from its banality?was</page><page sequence="8">Herbert Golder 181 predictable: Shakespearian declamatory techniques (without Shakespeare's language); translationese replete with the occa sional, Greek-sounding compound adjective and adjuration of the gods ("Athena, Zeus, Poseidon?help!" is, believe it or not, a line of choral lyric); a stark stage with something vaguely emblematic on it (in this case a smoking tarmac and some miniature menhirs that looked like inverted croquet mallets);22 the occasional stylized action, like Antigone walking in slow motion to her tomb to remind us this is "Greek"; lots of strutting and expansive gestur ing, and spitting, lots of spitting, and, let's not forget, that "chorus thing." You see, the production proclaims, it's just like us after all, just like our theater, our strutting and spitting neoclassicizing Shakespearean theater, but with a chorus amplifying, if not intelli gibly then at least audibly, everything that is said and done. With Medea it was more of the same, only the conventions, and therefore the cliches, were different.23 Diana Rigg is a fine actress, but her presence alone, her penetrating looks, her flashing eyes, her throaty emotions do not add up to Medea. Maybe if the cam era of a Carl Dreyer or a Bergman were caressing her a sufficiently magical persona might emerge, but from across the room her Medea within did not emanate. And there was little of note in the play apart from her performance: a dowdy chorus of three who alternately sang and chanted and mumbled all those meaningless lyrics and added antiphony, from time to time, to Medea's cries.24 As for Jason and Creon, they were nothing but strutting cocks, Medea's straw men. In spite of this, Tim Oliver Woodward's Jason proved so convincing that this is the only production of Medea I have ever seen where Jason appears to be the more sympa thetic character. Far from being the vulgar opportunist of Euripi des' play, this Jason made such good and compelling sense that it was difficult to fathom why Medea was going to kill her children. Since Diana Rigg did not seethe with hatred (an "intelligent" even "elegant" Medea, the New York critics kept calling her), her reac tions and course of action seemed simply "unreasonable," even grossly undignified, under the circumstances. An impression in no way helped by her awkwardly jerky, even spastic, fluttering move ments all over the stage. But this Medea was not only unreasonable, she was something else that I have also never before seen Medea be: funny. Dis covering that American audiences, in particular, found the Briti cisms of the text and her own bantering style of delivery amusing,</page><page sequence="9">182 GEEK TRAGEDY??OR, WHY I'D RATHER GO TO THE MOVIES Rigg decided to play for laughs. What is arguably the most provoc ative line in Euripides' Greek?"I would rather fight three times on the front line than bear one child"?got laughs! That this unfortunately risible performance won its well-accented British star a Tony Award in New York testifies to the fact that Master piece Theater is what American audiences have been conditioned to expect of the classics. British "Shakespearese" mixes uneasily with a translation that is notable for its concessions to the glib, and sometimes slangy vernacular.25 The (colloquially) British tone of the production, the fidgety artificiality of its emoting, is summed up in the last word that the murderess Medea speaks to the pleading, defeated Jason, in her moment of terrible triumph as the lights go out: "Rubbish." The precise word, ironically, which Rigg herself uttered as she held her trophy in the air: "I was told Americans didn't take to classics, which is rubbish."26 I don't think I have ever turned to Variety for the last word on Greek trag edy, but its reviewer got it right when he concluded "... this 'Medea' bypasses the heart."27 As I watched this bloodless production I kept thinking of Jules Dassin's extraordinary film, Dream of Passion, about a star who wants to play Medea but fails (at first) because she confuses poetry and passion, magic and mystery, with current events. Medea as a strong and fiery woman turned victim, no matter how stellar the performance, is not sufficient dramatic motivation for the crime Medea commits. It is on what vindicates her terrible crime, not merely its commission and her despair, which is the stuff of domes tic violence, that the power of this disturbing play depends. But here was the same old story all over again, without believable hor ror, with only jealous rage and nothing more than "classical" pas sion. Even the infanticide went as if by rote, with the bodies barely visible, faces turned away, in Medea's lit compartment above in the stage wall. And of the dragon-drawn, sun-chariot Euripides sends to rescue Medea, which marks her crime as monstrous but also signals something disconcertingly divine, not a sign. Instead, only a ghoulish light shone from beneath that gave Rigg a slightly demented glare.28 With the poetry, and Medea's larger-than-life passion, went her supernatural savior, the Sun, whose appearance in Euripides' play is as shocking as the murders themselves. Sans chorus, sans gods, sans the complexities of Euripides' dramatic vision, the passion of Medea looms no larger than Medea herself, and this is fatal to the playwright's plan. When we look around, at</page><page sequence="10">Herbert Golder 183 domestic violence or the diurnal slaughterhouse that is the world's stage, what, in truth, makes Medea's story anything more than a contemporary atrocity or a bloodless archetype? I will return to this, but by way of Mnouchkine, by looking at how the very attempt to stylize a work as a "classic" results in its reduction to a clich?. III. Greek theater is indeed stylized, very much so. It has incorporated elements of ritual, religious rites, and mysteries. The Greeks pos sessed a repertoire of gestures and emblematic tableaux?drawn from mime, dance, and the visual arts?that doubtless began as, and over time became increasingly, conventional. But, at least this is my sense, such stylization was a means to ever fuller, richer, and more varied, culturally familiar forms of expression. Turning however to the stylized theaters of the orient, as Mnouchkine has done, has now become conventional stock-in-trade. And while the spectacles generated are undeniably brilliant, theirs is a cold, hard beauty, in part because their provenance is so remote, like alien masks into which we cannot penetrate. The Indian Kathakali dances and the Kabuki squats and stances, the Asiatic costuming and music, the ritual precision controlling every gesture, move ment, and millisecond of production made, through their cumula tive effect, undeniably powerful even spellbinding theater. But repetition can turn rigid. And these are not, after all, our rituals (if indeed we have rituals of a comparable kind) nor even our rhythms: they create a sense of estrangement that does not so much appropriate the otherness of Greek drama via the hieratic theaters of the East as distance it even further. It is not our soil from which these blossoms burst; they have been cultivated in the hothouse of another culture's making. To orientalize the Greeks is, in the vernacular of our contemporary theater, to "classicize" them?but they become someone else's classics. These mandarin forms, once transplanted, take on a life of their own and threaten to smother the urgency and the iconoclasm of the medium itself. Nietzsche defined culture as a unity of style manifest in all the vital activities of a people, the opposite of an eclectic con-fusion of cultures or smorgasbord of styles.29 The theater can express and transform a culture but it cannot adventitiously create one. For this reason, I was in the main more moved by the Breuer/Telson Gospel at Colonus (about whose Pentecostal Oedipus I also have</page><page sequence="11">184 GEEK TRAGEDY??OR, WHY I'D RATHER GO TO THE MOVIES some serious reservations) than by Mnouchkine's oriental Ore steia.30 Its generic differences notwithstanding, the Breuer/Telson production moved to rhythms with which I feel greater cultural affinity. Unlike the rituals through which Mnouchkine put us, I felt with The Gospel at Colonus that I had entered a sacred space that exploded with chthonian energies set in motion by the gospel score. Here was the sound of the sacred that still engages our com mon culture, derivative and traditional but transformed, a viable vehicle for both sacred and profane, one simultaneously Dionysian and hieratic, that resonates throughout our contemporary experi ence and all our arts from music to film. And this medley of music, miraculous and mundane, brings us nearer to the experience of Greek drama?with its curious mix of sacred and secular, aulic and vernacular, lyric and iambic, human and divine?than a m?lange of eastern mysteries and French neoclassical acting. Although almost diametrically opposed to Mnouchkine's Ore steia in form and feeling (perhaps because of this), Andr? Serban's Euripidean trilogy {Electra, Medea, and Trojan Women), first produced some twenty years ago in New York, provides an inter esting comparison. Serban's astonishingly laryngeal, orgastic tril ogy, his primitivized Euripides, so full of barely contained animal violence, stands perhaps at the opposite extreme from Mnouch kine's flawlessly orchestrated Aeschylus. A tour de force of experi mental theater, Serban's production drew as heavily on traditional ritual theaters as on contemporary movement and dance. The characters did not speak so much as chant a bizarre medley of syl lables and sounds from the original Greek, Seneca's Latin, Dante's Italian, and ancient N?huatl?an orchestration of emotionally charged vocables that suggested archetypes of unadulterated feel ing, a language, in other words, of pure emotional power. If only, I remember thinking more than twenty years ago when I saw Ser ban's trilogy (then knowing next to nothing about the Greeks), if only someone could find a language, scenic and poetic, in which these raw, elemental passions could be caged.31 Mnouchkine did not find it. Greek tragedy can still best be described as Nietzsche described it: an Apollonian cage that barely contains the energies of the god Dionysus who forever threatens to destroy it. Missing from Les Atrides, was anarchy, risk, danger?in a word, Dionysus?that is, the raw experience from which the drama must arise and speak. And this Greek drama did and does do. But an inventory of</page><page sequence="12">Herbert Golder 185 conventions that have ossified into an orthodoxy of production style now stands in our way. Even in the first play of Mnouch kine's tetralogy, the repetition of gestures, of choreographed movements and poses, which were imposed on, rather than arising from, the action and scenic vision embedded in Aeschylus' words, began to seem a set of visually impressive but decontextualized conventions, a repertoire with which the director has by now her self grown complacent. They lent coherence, they "worked," but for a set of referents outside both the play and our own cultural ecumene. Of course, we and she know full well what she is doing; and we know because we have seen all this before: the Greeks in the key of Asia minor?Greek drama as Eastern mystery, temple dance, as Kabuki and Noh. Others, like Sato and Suzuki, have already done it, to mention only two?directors whose Nippon ized Greeks become esthetically beautiful and, especially in Suzuki's case, conceptually powerful.32 But their Greeks are, by any reckoning, icily formalized and austere, diamonded stagings that too angularly refract, too tightly contain the fiery Dionysian god at their core. The method must not manner the madness. Lose Dionysus, Nietzsche warned, and Apollo too puts out his light. This, at least, was my problem with these three productions, so representative of the ways we nowadays appropriate the Greeks: we have imposed our contemporary concerns on them and corres pondingly oversimplified their complexity; or closeted them in a skeleton of conventions, turning them into a beautiful and bizarre spectacle from another land, over-decorated with tapestries from the orient, woven in exotic patterns we have all now seen too many times before. On the other side of the Channel, they have been squeezed into Elizabethan collars?strait jackets that strangle and stop their blood; on "the fringe," they have been minimalized into purely political theater or stripped down to stages bare enough for Beckett (or a showcase for a star); they have been deconstructed and postmodernized, stripped of their comprehensive ordering power and their potentially more spacious vision of our own expe rience.33 In general, style has come to dominate substance, and a classicizing style of production at that, because, after all, these are the classics?plays with power but no surprises. And so style is king. But Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides' theater is far from conventional, in our sense; for that matter, it is hardly "classical" at all. It shocks, transforms, and violates expectations at every</page><page sequence="13">186 GEEK TRAGEDY??OR, WHY I'D RATHER GO TO THE MOVIES turn. Drama as the Greeks created, practiced, and performed it would be banished as sacrilegious from any Eastern temple rite. And only a theater attuned to this can come anywhere near render ing the dynamism of Greek tragedy. Formal restraint, checked (or choked) passions, columnar choruses, and overly esthetized chore ography will not come close. It amazes me that myths of highly formalized and classically contained Greeks still persist. They cel ebrated these as desiderated ideals because restraint was what they were most characteristically incapable of. And in drama above all does Dionysus burst his bounds. For Greek theater did not achieve classical stature (whatever that means) for its formal and esthetic properties (which are, even if we could reproduce them, an idiom utterly alien to us anyway) but for the tales they tell and the shock ing and innovative ways their tellings chronicled the inner saga of who we still fear or hope to be. But how can we blame contemporary directors for their mispri sions, when they have received so little help from classical schol ars? How can we blame Jonathan Kent and Diana Rigg for her costive Medea when, in the program notes, an eminent authority from Oxford cites a still more eminent and influential authority to the effect that Medea punishes Jason, and justly, because he broke an oath he swore in the name of Zeus?not, mind you, because he broke a promise to her but because he took the name of Zeus in vain!?as if this were a crime and punishment episode out of the Old Testament, a Talmudic homily about piety, rather than a drama about a woman who murders her children.34 And when a critic in the TLS, an authority from Cambridge (not this time a philologue but a sophisticated, postmodernist literary critic), tells us that the Medea is really about the perils of language, its disinte gration, that "words as much as people are the victims of tragic crimes," a point that this authority reiterates eight times in five paragraphs, then the reasons that directors have stylized, cere bralized, intellectualized, conventionalized, orientalized, multi culturalized the guts out of Greek tragedy is fairly clear.35 It is a template on which we work out our own agenda, a tabula rasa to which we assign intentions, and an operating theater in which we bare what M?ntale once called "our spasmodic need for the con temporary." But even what we call "contemporary" is already con strained by its own, already modishly outmoded conventions. Just because an image or idea is new, does not necessarily mean it is</page><page sequence="14">Herbert Golder 187 fresh. And like the so-called Chinese garbage fruit, some fresh things can give off quite a stink. IV. The Greek theater was a public theater and the audience a rude one. They were not polite or cultured esthetes, poised in reverent attention like visitors in a museum. The audience consisted of farmers and blacksmiths, soldiers and muledrivers, tanners and traders, bricklayers and carpenters, prostitutes and pimps, as well as a tiny minority of the cultured few. The scant testimonia indi cate that the Greeks often walked out mid-performance for a meal, or, if the acting was bad or the play weak, ate right there during the show, even going so far as to throw dried fruits and stones at actors they didn't like. Once, so the story goes, an out-of-breath actor in a Euripidean production misplaced a word accent and was doubtless pelted off the stage with figs. Those in attendance might whistle, hiss, and stomp as well. Stomping was a particularly pop ular form of expressing disapproval, the sound augmented by knocking the backs of wood shoes against wooden benches. And there were hooters, and of course a famous belcher who was also distinguished for hissing when others applauded and then loudly applauding once the rest of the audience settled down. (Think about it: at the first and only?I'll come back to this?production of the Oedipus Tyrannus there was, in all probability, someone in the audience making rude sounds!) As I said, a tough house, and the playwrights of this new and suddenly popular medium had their work cut out for them. If ever a theater needed to be louder than life it was this one, with crowds more like English football hooligans than modern theatergoers. No hushed reverence, no patient waiting in lines, no latecomers being denied entrance, no docile staying-put during intermission here. Mnouchkine's Gallic jailors would have deterred no one.36 In fact, Greek drama was a radically new medium that assimi lated older traditional media?forms of ritual, mime, choral dance, lyric, epic, music, painting and sculpture, in which the cul tural experiences and habits of its audience were grounded; it absorbed, transformed, and ultimately superseded these older forms.37 Like film in its beginnings, Greek drama was a whole new medium which arose rapidly, at a period of enormous cul tural upheaval and change, from a technical innovation (Thespis' actor/Edison's kinetoscope) to a mature art?arose to become the</page><page sequence="15">188 GEEK TRAGEDY??OR, WHY I'D RATHER GO TO THE MOVIES synesthetic myth-making medium of its day. And it was the art of the new, the art of the city, a gauntlet thrown down to the archaic Greek past. It articulated the aspirations of the democratic city over and against the assumptions that lay buried immemorially in an archaic past. It was a new form of vision, one which individu ated the actor from the chorus with Apollonian confidence and audacity, but one which also recognized the prior claims of a more ancient culture in which the emerging values were rooted. In the theater everything was new, innovative, experimental. Far from being reverential treatments of canonical material, the Greek theater was a crucible of dramatic surprise and cultural metamorphosis. No one, least of all the tragedians, thought they were producing the "classics"; the Oedipus Tyrannus, on which Aristotle based his whole theory of drama and which, as classical paradigm, has informed our sense of the classical play, did not even win first prize but was defeated, on the day it was performed, by the plays of Philokles (who?). Euripides rarely won a dramatic contest; although he wrote and produced well over a hundred plays, he was to win first place only five times in his entire career. Even his Medea came in last, bested by the work of his rival, that well-known dramatic genius Euphorion (who?). However mixed the reception to his plays, Euripides' choruses nevertheless became hits, made the "top forty," and were so popular that, as Plutarch relates, Athenian sailors were able to save their lives, after the disastrous naval war against Sicily, only if they could teach their Sicilian captors Euripidean songs. Maybe, despite his undeniable gifts as a song-writer, it was the self-consciousness with which Euripides deployed the conventions established by his predeces sors?whose canonicity is paradoxically established, even exag gerated, by virtue of being parodied?that made him seem too "classical" for the Athenian taste. But Aeschylus was a comer, and won the first prize many times. The Greek playwrights composed their plays for one perfor mance only. They were one-season wonders. In the fifth century, Aeschylus alone was accorded the unique honor of having some of his plays restaged after his death. But since he was dead, he could not have known so anomalous a fate would befall them nor could he have composed with restaging in mind. The life-span of a Greek play was no more than the morning of its production; it was ephemeral as a "happening," fading as an image on silver nitrate film. There was not, in all likelihood, even anything like a fixed</page><page sequence="16">Herbert Golder 189 text in existence. On the contrary, our evidence suggests that for Greek playwrights composition and performance were coeval and coterminous. As composers, choreographers, and directors, they made their plays in and of the theater. The state, which subsidized productions with the help of wealthy citizens, granted a chorus to prospective playwrights on the basis of their song and dance rou tines, their ability to "make a scene."38 Playwrights like Aeschylus did their boldest and best thinking in theatrical terms. And his use of the medium, the iconoclastic visualizations that embodied his vision, his theatrical bravura, is what we seem least attuned to today.39 Theatrical clich?s are overturned in virtually every scene of the Oresteia. Almost everything about it is a surprise achieved in sce nic forms so arresting that the story about women in the audience miscarrying at the sight of the Furies may well be true. No one had ever before dared dredge these ghouls up from their darkness and expose them to the daylight of the Attic stage; vase painters did not paint them. That original audience must have run for cover like those Parisians who fled the theater and ducked beneath seats at that first viewing of one of the very first films, Lumi?re's Express Train Entering Lyon, as the illusory train seemed to rush from the screen. But we need not focus on the more spectacular examples of Aeschylus' iconoclastic genius. Consider the humble watchman who opens the Agamemnon. The entire audience was doubtless buzzing as he stood up and began to speak. This is a stage on which kings and queens, gods and goddesses are wont to stride. This is the story of the legendary, semi-divine House of Atreus. What then is this bumpkin doing up there? With one audaciously original stroke, Aeschylus appealed, through this peasant gazing into a strange and uncertain universe of greater forces, directly to the anxious watchman, the peering groundling, in us all. Imagine the audience's amazement that this yeoman, their neighbor, has wandered into this mythological realm, climbed atop the royal house, and now addresses them, in all likelihood from the theolo geion, that is, the elevated place from which gods and goddesses speak. Or consider the choruses of Aeschylus' Agamemnon. Of Aeschylus' rival Phrynichus, the testimonia state that his dances were famous for their inventive variety, with "as many steps as the waves in the sea on a cruel night of winter."40 And Aeschylus, who</page><page sequence="17">190 GEEK TRAGEDY??OR, WHY I'D RATHER GO TO THE MOVIES competed against him, was himself a master of the dance who not only choreographed his own plays but, as a recognized master, taught other playwrights and choreographers the dancing art. Here too he was innovator and improvisor. The wild variety of the sea on a cruel winter night, however, does not suggest the rigidly ritualized range of gesture and movement displayed by Mnouch kine's disciplined Kathakali chorus. The dances of Greek tragedy may have been religious in origin but Aeschylus refined and gave them new life as high art, as if Baryshnikov had choreographed a ceremony in Irian Jaya. Imagine the audience's reaction to the parodos of the Agamem non, when, instead of Martha Graham or Alvin Ailey, a gaggle of gimp-legged geezers comes stumbling in, leaning on staves, com plaining of their infirmity, hobbling about the stage. And this in a play by Aeschylus no less, so well-known for his mastery of dances! It's like a scene from Beckett suddenly cropping up in the middle of The Ring or a performance of Swan Lake. Where are Aeschylus' famous horsecocks and griffins, goddesses, and agile Ninja-like warriors, nymphs and Nereids?41 Of course, as he does with his watchman, he has hit his audience "where they live," pre senting in the old citizen chorus time-worn witnesses of events that they too must struggle to comprehend. I submit that Aeschy lus has dumbfounded his audience with this unprecedented chorus and that he has transformed archaic theatrical convention into human drama. What about Clytemnestra, so conspicuously at the center of Mnouchkine's drama? Aeschylus' Clytemnestra would have shocked his audience for reasons very different from Mnouch kine's bereaved and sobbing queen. No victim was she, but a virago of fierce, almost cosmic, energies, as in her famous beacon speech where, in the ferocity of her language?describing torch fires flaring comet-like across the Aegean and stabbing through to the shores of Greece?she seems almost to ignite the skies. But she confounds all categories; she, as the chorus keeps telling us, has a manly courage and a woman's cunning. Or is it a man's cunning and a woman's courage? Or which is now which? Which is pre cisely the point. Clytemnestra keeps turning the categories inside out. In other words, Aeschylus' Clytemnestra appears like a huge strutting drag queen who moves chameleon-like from alluring woman to brassy man and shatters the moral and intellectual polarities according to which we order our lives.42 In Aeschylus,</page><page sequence="18">Herbert Golder 191 the sacrifice of Iphigeneia is less the predicate for Clytemnestra's crime than a way of awakening, in temporal sequence, what Cly temnestra symbolically is: the woman Agamemnon deserves. It is likely that no one in Aeschylus' audience had ever seen any thing like his Clytemnestra before. That men played female parts was a given, a convention. But no one had ever before made drama out of that convention. A man playing a woman, Clytemnestra draws on the man beneath the mask, and in her sexual dualism evinces a disconcertingly elemental power that burns beneath the skin. In one very famous scene in the Libation Bearers (and we can only guess how Aeschylus staged it), Clytemnestra bares her breast just as Orestes steels himself to kill her?"how can you strike this breast that gave you suck" (896f.). We can only imagine the shock wave felt by that initial audience. Cross-dressing rituals and transvestism, especially in initiations among warrior societies, were by no means unknown in Greece, but Aeschylus has here energized a mysterious ritual, and an ambivalence built into his theater (as Euripides would do again more than half a century later with his Bacchae) into disturbingly dramatic life. His audience would not, like the chorus, know what, or which end, so to speak, is up. But in order to present Clytemnestra as a sob-sister, the breast-baring scene is suppressed in Mnouchkine's script and replaced by a tender scene of piet?. In considering Aeschylus' inventive daring, one should not over look the (almost) silent Pylades in the Libation Bearers. Up to this point in the trilogy, two-thirds of the way through the second play, Aeschylus would have appeared to be following the two-actor con vention: only two speaking actors are onstage at any given time.43 Strangely shadowing Orestes' every step throughout the play, Pylades, the audience assumes, is a mute character. But at the cli matic scene, as Orestes wavers before bare-breasted Clytemnestra, Pylades breaks the silence imposed by theatrical convention. It is as if a stone had spoken: "Kill her," he says, "it is the will of Apollo."44 It is difficult for us to imagine how surprising this would have been. Pylades, we have been led, and have every rea son, to believe, will not speak. He does not, however, now merely speak, but speaks with vatic authority, echoing the oracle of Apollo himself. Its shock is comparable to that, say, caused by Linda Blair in The Exorcist?to pull a moment of startling outcry from not so distant cinematic memory?when her girlish frame</page><page sequence="19">192 GEEK TRAGEDY??OR, WHY I'D RATHER GO TO THE MOVIES emitted that raspishly guttural voice from hell. It was utterly and awfully uncanny, and once heard, never forgotten. Aeschylus' changing of the scene in the Eumenides from Delphi to Athens after the play was underway hardly gives us pause. Exe unt omnes. Fade to black. Enter the Chorus. Business as usual? but it is not. Aeschylus' audience was doubtless dumbfounded by his audacity, at what today may strike us as merely an uneventful change of scene. Only in one other place in all of extant drama does the stage empty completely and the scene change as here. But never (so far as we know) before this moment. The Eumenides opens with Orestes huddled at the altar of Apollo, surrounded by the sleeping Furies. This oracle of Apollo at Delphi is the spiritual center of the ancient world, the holy of holies for the whole of Greece. No sooner, however, is the stage set than we are suddenly transported to Athens. There, not Delphi, will judgment be ren dered. Not only does everyone, chorus and actors, exit and the stage empty, which has never happened before (it would be like the first five minutes of Cage's first recital o? Silence), but the spiritual center of the ancient world has just been daringly transposed to Athens. It is an act of theatrical, theological, and political hybris. As if to say to his Athenian audience and to the entire Hellenic world, this case, out of which civilized justice will evolve, is too important for Delphi, navel of Greece. Only Athens can decide, our goddess, of course, and that first citizen jury of twelve good men and true. It is like moving the Vatican, Jerusalem, and Mecca into the middle of New York, arrogating their collective spiritual authority to decide a case on which the values and identity of the city, the nation, and the world depend. All this would have struck that original audience as wondrously and absolutely outrageous. And just a note about Aeschylus' language, which we think of as archaic but which spellbound a popular audience of mostly ordi nary folk?a language of power and complexity, one that forges poetry out of archaic ritual formulae and a dense mass of tradi tional saga and song. Try to imagine a poetry that ranges from the vernacular to the sublime, that has the textured density (if one were to reach for English and American, poetic and musical equiv alents) of Donne, the sonority of Marlowe, the metrical variety of Hopkins, the lyricism of Yeats, the playful sententiousness of a Bob Dylan, the Dionysian rhythms of the Rolling Stones, the racy immediacy and percussive vigor of a rapper and, not least, the dra matic power of Shakespeare?and not a word of it arty, but in an</page><page sequence="20">Herbert Golder 193 argot that stevedores and teamsters thrill to?and you have some idea of the scope of his dramatic genius. (Again, reaching for anal ogies, one might think of the way the streets of Italy once echoed with arias by Verdi and Rossini, of the mass appeal of this refined and complex art form, its extraordinary capacity for expressing the soul of a people.) This is why Aeschylus was so popular, why he won so many prizes, why we now apprize him a classic, and why he came across as anything but classical in his own day. V. Everyone knows the story of Oedipus. Freud has taken the fun out of it for us forever. But suffice it to say that Freud's is a very un Greek reading of Sophocles' play. Even the most hard-core Freud ian has to see the tautology involved in saying that Sophocles' Oedipus has an Oedipal Complex. This is like looking through a telescope turned the wrong way round.45 So apart from (maybe) dramatizing a psychic conflict that certain neurotics think is cen tral to our emotional life, what is so great about Sophocles' Oedi pus Tyrannus, which did not, as I said, even manage to win first prize at the City Dionysia? Well, there is indeed something very great about it, something very shocking, something so new that the Athenians may have had trouble comprehending it (and so mis prized it?), but it has nothing to do with Freud's complex or with its conforming to Aristotle's academic notions of propter hoc structure?that is, of being the perfectly classical play. (To judge from jurors, that may have cost it.) Its greatness and originality does, however, have to do with this: in no extant pre-Sophoclean account does Oedipus blind himself, nor does Jocasta, his mother, bear his children and then commit suicide. (In other versions, he marries his mother but his children are borne by a second wife.) Parricide and incest are universal mythical themes, but Oedipus' self-blinding is a thoroughly Sophoclean innovation, a visualiza tion of astonishing dramatic power and with shocking implica tions. In Homer's Odyssey we are told that Oedipus continued to reign in Thebes long after his baleful fate was known.46 And unless Aeschylus beat Sophocles to it some years earlier (and the evidence for this is shaky47), never before that cloudless spring morning in the Theater of Dionysus had Oedipus, legendary parricide and incestual lover of his mother, gouged out his eyes in horror at what he had done.48 He was simply the man who married his mother, and as Jocasta tells him in Sophocles' play, men dream of this all</page><page sequence="21">194 GEEK TRAGEDY??OR, WHY I'D RATHER GO TO THE MOVIES the time. In Book 6 of his Histories, Herodotus narrates the dream of Hippias, exiled sixth-century tyrant of Athens: Hippias dreamed that he would marry his mother and, because of this, awoke elated, for he took this to mean he would return a conquer ing hero to his homeland, his motherland, Athens. In the context of an archaic, earth-centered culture attuned to its season-rhythmed cycle of living and dying, such a marriage means making symbolic contact, merging with the center and source of creation itself. But Sophocles has obviously transformed this into a tale of horror with an utterly different meaning and out come. In other words, it is not the archaic tale of incest that shocks, but Oedipus' unique destiny as a sort of existential Kojak, his detective-like search and discovery that he is himself the murderer, the pollution, the beast his mind has been tracking. But it is the emblematic blinding?Sophocles' tragic epiphany?that is his real coup de th??tre. The anthropologist Glenn Shepard was recently collecting sto ries among the Machiguenga in the Amazon basin. After a time his informers grew tired of the one-way exchange and asked for myths in return. Shepard said that we really did not possess myths in quite the same way as they did but thought that the story of Oedi pus would be as good a candidate as any. His Machiguenga audi ence listened in a characteristically calm fashion and without incident until he got to the part about the blinding, by which they were manifestly surprised. In fact, they found the incident bizarre and laughed uproariously and made the anthropologist repeat that part over and over again, incredulous that he could have gotten the story right.49 No strangers to violence and myths of elemental sav agery (including an Oedipus-like story), they were dumbfounded that Oedipus would blind himself just because he slept with his mother, as men often do in myth.50 This was a new twist in an old tale, the likes of which they had never heard before. And that to which the Machiguenga reacted with such surprise would, I con tend, have been equally surprising to Sophocles' audience: Oedi pus' self-blinding. Sophocles transforms for his Athenian audience a Theban legend about Oedipus into the paradigm of the tragic quest. Oedipus discovers that he returns in fact to the very womb of mother-life from which he came, and dashes his eyes out in hor ror. For earth-centered man, to return to the earth is to be restored to the divine; but the man whose deathless gods dwell in the sky struggles against the retrogressive tug of his origins in the womb/</page><page sequence="22">Herbert Golder 195 tomb which he aspires to transcend. And so for the Machiguenga, whose gods live in the land, Oedipus' "tragedy" is utterly incomprehensible. About one thing is Sophocles emphatically clear: it is Oedipus and Oedipus alone who gouges out his eyes?"Apollo may have done all else, but I and I alone took these golden broaches and stabbed them down into my eyes" (1329ff.). What Sophocles' audience saw?and saw for the very first time?as Oedipus emerged from the palace, blind and bleeding but newly sighted, was Oedipus as the visible emblem of tragic seeing, the physical embodiment of his tragic truth, the man who looked into the abyss of Dionysian blood and darkness. But in his determined revelation we also see the god Apollo, the light stabbing down into darkness that makes all clear, a light that exits nowhere in this play outside the will and mind of Oedipus. Here was an ancient legend brought to light with stunning nov elty. The challenge is to dramatize a man who sees such things and in such a way?for the first time?that is, with their full and freshly revelatory power. In our post-Freudian age of polymorphic perversity and televisual horror, with reports of Bosnians forced to swallow their eyeballs before being executed, making this Oedi pus mean anew requires more than the RSC's brand of howling histrionics. What about Medea, that third-place work? We all know the story. Medea, of course, is the woman from myth who murders her children. Not so. Medea never murdered her children because of Jason's betrayal before that morning in 431 BC when Euripides made her do so in the Theater of Dionysus. She was certainly known to his audience from myth as Jason's exotic queen, the Colchian enchantress who, conceiving a great passion for Jason, betrayed her own father to help Jason fulfil his destiny by securing the Golden Fleece. Except in a very obscure Corinthian legend which involves some machinations of Hera, with which it is doubt ful that anyone in Euripides' audience would have been familiar, Medea is not known as the woman who murdered her children.51 Therefore no one can know in advance just what Euripides is doing or how his story will unfold. By denying the passion for which she lives and which she embodies?"It wasn't you," says Jason, "it was Aphrodite who made you help me" (526ff.)?Jason virtually creates the Medea who destroys him. In his novel version that presents a Medea who lives for love and whom betrayal turns</page><page sequence="23">196 GEEK TRAGEDY??OR, WHY I'D RATHER GO TO THE MOVIES into a killer, we witness Medea for the first time become?be come, that is, dramatically transformed into?the character that we now associate with the myth. But what elevates this play above a story from Hard Copy or Frontline} Why should we be more disturbed by Medea than, say, by beloved and betrayed Fumiko Kimura who drowned her two children, Kazutaki, four, and Yuri, six months, in the sea near Santa Monica on a cold January morning in 1985; or former attor ney Sandra Butterworth, a jilted divorc?e, who shot her sixteen year-old son on the eve of her ex-husband's election as Florida's Attorney General in November of 1986; or recently divorced Kimberly Martin who put one bullet each in the heads of Dustin, eight, and Brandy, four, on an Iowa highway less than two years ago; or, for that matter, the well publicized case of South Carolina native Susan Smith, who strapped her two young sons, Michael, three, and Alex, fourteen months, securely in their safety seats and then rolled her car into a lake? What, then, is so special about Medea? How has Euripides wor ried this seemingly primal tale of passion, this possibly late-break ing news story, into disturbing new life? Murderess of her children, she touches something elemental. But what and how are we to react? Can revenge on a cold-blooded opportunist like Jason justify the slaughter of two innocents? Medea's infanticide is not some mythical given. It has never happened before today. It is not only Jason who cannot comprehend. The chorus of Corinthian women also ask, "How can you stain your hands with your babies' blood?"?a question every member of the audience must likewise ask. And Euripides' answer to their question could not be more resounding. After the murders, Medea does not simply exit stage left for Athens. On the contrary, the golden, dragon-drawn chariot of her divine grandfather, the Sun, appears to whisk her away, marking her exit more an epiphany or apotheosis. The pure light of the sun, the divine force of Nature, elemental physis now appears to deliver, and therefore vindicate, the crimes of Medea. The chari ot's yellow gold is, especially given the chromatic range of this play, the color of the blazing, life-giving rays of the Sun above, but also the color of Aphrodite, as seen, in its destructive mani festation, as the poison robe of eros Medea gives to Glauce and the golden flames of passion that consume the princess. Only now it erupts onstage, with surprising violence and in shocking</page><page sequence="24">Herbert Golder 197 complicity, to objectify in divine epiphany the elemental passions of Medea that a world of Jasons cannot ignore. It is however this ending, the divine epiphany, which so many critics have criticized and directors scanted, that makes the story of Medea more than the story of a victim turned vicious, or woman over the edge,52 or psychopathic killer, or Macumba Mama53 or oriental demon54 or Colchian witch,55 but rather that of a woman whose ardor is so great, and who incarnates something so crucial, that the gods appear to vindicate her crime. No modern produc tion that I have ever seen has realized the elemental and transcen dental nature of Medea's passion save one. This production was, in fact, not a play but a film, and one, moreover, that also chal lenges the adequacy of the modern theater to deal with Greek drama. This film addresses the danger of merely psychologizing Greek myth, of reducing Greek tragedy to our contemporary agenda, of assimilating the Greeks to some urgently topical idea? of using the Greeks as a way of facilely cosmologizing current events. This film is Jules Dassin's Dream of Passion (1978). It is the story of a Greek actress, an acclaimed international movie star, who returns to Greece to play Medea with the equivalent of the Greek National Theater. I should say "star" in Medea, since she is there to be the great actress staring in the classical play.56 But she hasn't a clue who Medea is. (The comparison with Diana Rigg as Medea is irresistible.) She is a woman with no real passion, only a style, glamorous and exotic to be sure; a woman who has found a mask, a persona, behind which she can hide from herself and the world. In an argument with her director about love, she shows her hand. She says, fondling the hair of a young paramour (who turns out to be impotent): "I know about Medea and passion and love, I have love always, every day, and on my terms, which are no terms." To which the director replies: "Every day is not always and no terms is no love and no love is no passion and no passion is no Medea." Later in the film she makes this discovery about herself for herself; she confronts her emptiness and lack of passion for or commitment to anything, her own Jason-like solipsism; her illu sions shattered, she sinks to a depth from which it becomes possi ble to discover the desperation and fire that drives a Medea. But this film is about more than an actress stepping behind the mask, penetrating the persona (Bergman's Persona is, inciden tally, screened at one point and is clearly, as much as Medea, the</page><page sequence="25">198 GEEK TRAGEDY??OR, WHY I'D RATHER GO TO THE MOVIES inspiration behind this film57). The actress meets a real Medea, a woman incarcerated in an Athenian prison who committed Me dea's actual crime.58 No symbolic or remotely ritual killing is this, but a murder with all its visceral horror and reality unattenuated. At first, the actress arranges the meeting as a publicity stunt, an act of callous, self-interested exploitation worthy of Jason. But the woman's ferocious and wounded look, upon discovering that she has been exploited, begins to gnaw at the actress. Unable to con tinue with her performance, she returns to the prison to beg the other woman's forgiveness and then, remarkably, a Bergman-like phasing of personae begins to take place?through cross-cutting, close-ups, a carefully orchestrated series of flashbacks and deep focus?as she sympathetically penetrates the other woman's expe rience. But what saves this film from being merely a merging of Greek myth with current events, or being simply a study in aber rant behavior or classical and contemporary psychosis, what, in other words, lifts Medea's passion to a supernatural solar chariot is this: Brenda Collins/Medea is a woman of sincere religious feel ings that cannot be simply psychologized or rationalized away.59 Brenda's intensity of belief, her ingenuousness, and the fact that she is the only character?in contrast to the other shallow, self centered, completely secular people in the film?who possesses anything like love or faith, and the fact, moreover, that a 2000 year-old religious tradition stands behind her biblical rhetoric make it difficult to diagnose her as simply crazy. "That doctor (the psychiatrist) said I was crazy," Brenda tells the actress, "one per son split in two, shit like that. But I am one soul and one body saved and graced by God.... He knows my heart. He tried me. He knows my thoughts. I'm not afraid." By invoking God here, Das sin accomplishes what Euripides had accomplished by introducing the chariot of the sun. We are thus in the same quandary as Euripi des' audience. We know that what Brenda/Medea has done is criminal, insane?that, by any reckoning, this cannot be right. Yet the gods are on her side. We cannot help being bewildered that this woman who murdered her children is the only character capable of expressing feelings that could be called transcendent or absolute. Her bible and her devotion, her faith and purity of heart are her dragon chariot in the sky. Paradoxically, the magic of film, not the conventions of theater, has enabled the dramatization of Medea's passion into life.</page><page sequence="26">Herbert Golder 199 VI. If Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides were alive today they would be filmmakers?a D. W. Griffith, Sergei Eisenstein, or Ingmar Bergman. (Just as they might have been opera composers had they lived in the last century, innovators of an art simultaneously popu lar and refined, which that of the tragedians, in fact, inspired.60) The Greek dramatists were popular artists working in, indeed cre ating, the single most powerful, myth-making medium their cul ture possessed and would doubtless be doing the same today? behind the camera. And so I end with this provocation. The theater has its work cut out for it in a culture either numbed to tragedy by televisual horror, or heightened in sensibility by cin ematic vision. Cinema displays an unprecedented power to project iconic images, illusions at once intimate and abstract, whose power derives in part from nothing less than the mystery of light. In its very effort at stabbing through darkness to fix our gaze upon that which moves, film draws our Apollonian eye, as does Greek tragedy, irresistibly toward the dark Dionysiac experience that threatens to dissolve it. To recreate the Greeks the theater must then be louder than life, and must be able to draw on or compete with the media that condition its audience; it must also be true to life, arise out of the vernacular of our experience, sacred and pro fane, as well as be true to the imaginative life, power, and vision of the Greek original?but stripped of both its status as a classic and the classicizing conventions that encrust it. While I applaud contemporizing productions like Wadja's recent Solidarity Antigone or Ivica Boban's pointedly immediate Hecuba, performed in Dubrovnik while that city was under fire, or the Alcestis and Ajax recently produced in Sarajevo, the ephem eral must never be allowed to occlude the essential. Aeschylus' contemporary Phrynichus was fined by the Athenians for his play the Siege of Miletus, because the piece was considered too topi cal.61 It reminded the Athenians only of their own troubles. And the Oedipus, despite the innovated self-blinding, may have taken second instead of first because it was, well, as Aristotle was later to point out, just too perfectly "classical." For if the plays do not contain a permanent relevance and that crucial otherness after which we should strive, then they are not the work of great mas ters?as opposed to being merely, nominally, the "classics"?and not worth producing. Taking the samovar out of Chekhov and replacing it with a toaster oven, as Mel Gussow once said of Peter</page><page sequence="27">200 GEEK TRAGEDY??OR, WHY I'D RATHER GO TO THE MOVIES Sellars, replacing an alien artifact with an equally meaningless contemporary one, is not enough.62 We must get rid of the samovar altogether, junk the toaster oven, and find better ways to keep the classics warm. NOTES A version of this paper was presented as a public lecture sponsored by New Dramatists, New York City, November, 1992.1 am grateful for the forum they pro vided and to all those in the audience who participated in a stimulating discussion afterwards. 1.

Originally mounted outside Paris in 1991/2, at the Th??tre du SoleiPs head quarters, the Cartoucherie, a converted eighteenth-century munitions factory in Vincennes and then, before New York, in Montreal, this production has met with nearly universal acclaim. For close to two decades, Mnouchkine and her company have been recognized as major forces in world theater.

The ending of this play had the audience on its feet, clapping in time to the mu sic. The chorus joined Orestes in the dance and, for the first time in the production,</page><page sequence="28">Herbert Golder 201 danced with something like abandon. The gestures were those same stylized Katha kali gestures used throughout, only now spontaneously alive, animated by the drama itself. The unanimity on this scene is remarkable, even among those express ing strong criticism of much else in this production: e.g., Rich, Brustein, 37, Lahr, 104 (note 2); Lloyd Rose, "Classic Grandiosity in the Hangar of Art," The Wash ington Post, Oct. 11, 1992, Gl; Michael Finegold, "Leaps of Faith," The Village Voice, Oct. 13,1992,107. 5.

Noted by a number of critics: e.g., Rich, C16, Feingold, 107, Lahr, 103, Lyons, 55, Kirkpatrick (note 2). 8. Oedipus at Colonus, Ajax, Antigone, and, with a somewhat different empha sis, Women ofTrachis. Arising more from profound emotional and religious than patriotic sentiments, our own national concern (which goes far beyond the per sonal sense of loss and uncertainty felt by the families involved) over recovering the remains of the MIAs is perhaps analogous. Although we admittedly do not possess "hero cults" in any way comparable to the Greeks and in terms of which such anxi ety over the hero's burial?and whether his spirit will bless or blight?must be understood. 9. The chorus of the Oedipus at Colonus was altogether different in character. They wore hamster-cheeked masks and floor-length, stuffed gowns (decorated with shamrocks near the hem) that made them appear, as they lolled back and forth, like inflatable rocking dolls or pirouetting hippos from Disney's Fantasia ("pregnant buffaloes" is how one critic described them). For the life of me I cannot comprehend what these blimpish choristers were meant to represent. We are given no clue (thematic or dramatic) why living in Colonus has so disfigured the choris ters and made them resemble Zuni Mudheads more than the humans found in the comparatively anthropomorphic chorus of citizen elders in the other two plays. After all, they live near the sacred grove of the Furies not a nuclear waste dump. 10. In the Greek, lines 1081-3. Compare, for example, the same phrase in Robert Fitzgerald's masterful 1941 translation: "I . . . wish the wind would lift me like a dove...." 11. The list of bathos and banalities in this version is so extensive, and so reveal ing, that an excursus is justified. The aforesaid pigeons are to enjoy a "bird's-eye view," which is literally what the Greek says but not what it means poetically, since the colloquialism is wrong in both tone and feeling. In the prologue to the Oedipus Tyrannus, the Sphinx ("cruel Songstress") is referred to as a "relentless tax." The regal and commandeering Oedipus reassures the restive and plague-ridden chorus with resonant lines like "Only a bad man would ignore what the God says." In the fourth chorus of the Oedipus at Colonus, we find prosaic phrases such as "mani festly stupid" and "egalitarian Hades" and are told that the evils of old age are "glued together." In the famous messenger speech of this play mealy phrases like "your toilsome nurturing" and solecisms like "the shouts flaked" are bizarrely mixed. And everywhere there is translationese, phrases like "ill-fated two," "dark earthed hearth," "mule-drawn plough." In the famous "Ode to Man" in the An tigone, the "stormgray sea" (Fitts and Fitzgerald) becomes "the speckled sea"; stir ring lines like "Earth, holy and inexhaustible, is graven/With shining furrows</page><page sequence="29">202 GEEK TRAGEDY??OR, WHY I'D RATHER GO TO THE MOVIES where his plows have gone / Year and year, the timeless labor of stallions" (Fitts and Fitzgerald) become banausic: "Man . . ./criss-crosses the land /wearing away, scratching / the immortal, immutable/goddess earth/as he turns up the soil/year after year/with the mule-drawn plough." On the wild mountain that man's mind is said to conquer in this ode there now appears (highlighted by em dashes) a "hop ping goat"?not to be found in the Greek. Oedipus' bleeding eyes are described as dangling over his chin without spring ing back. "I cannot say you have done the right thing," says the chorus to newly blinded Oedipus, staggering in his gore, in what must go down as a new classic in English understatement. Too often the colloquial and the archaic make a verbal ragout: Oedipus says to Creon in the OC, "... coating harsh thoughts in dulcet sounds. That's you: good words, evil acts." Or, as if he were some sort of New Age guru, Oedipus is said to be "in touch with spiritual matters." And in places, in an effort to be "precise" as Ms. Wertenbaker alleges, English is used so carelessly and with such insensitivity to idiom that unwanted ambiguities result: "Not to be born wins the day ... but if a man must see the light, let him return quickly... "?where "seeing the light," which literally renders the Greek, where it means "being alive," suggests having a revelation in English which is something else altogether and thus muddies the meaning. I could go on enumerating the flaws of this production. So one wonders what standards are left when an English critic can write of this version: "Timberlake Wertenbaker's masterful new translation captures the beauty and dig nity of Sophocles' poetry perfectly" (Robert Tolliday, "An epic to stun, not stupify [sic]" Hampstead and Highgate Express, Sept. 18, 1992). Sophocles deserves bet ter than this. 12. The Antigone was, in all likelihood, produced sometime shortly before 440 BC (the year Sophocles was elected general, presumably in appreciation for his An tigone, while Athens was at the height of her power), the Oedipus sometime after 430 (after the beginning of the plague that decimated Athens and the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War), and the Oedipus at Colonus (posthumously) in 401. 13. The Iphigenia at Aulis was produced in 405 BC, some months after the play wright's death and just prior to that of the demoralized, war-ridden democracy itself. The best and most accessible general work on Aeschylus' theater and world view is John Herington's Aeschylus (New Haven 1986). Classical purists are not the only ones disturbed by Mnouchkine's tendentious grafting of Euripides onto Aeschylus. Most serious theater reviewers have com mented on her problematic, ideologically motivated choice: e.g., Rich, C16, Fein gold, Rose, Brustein (note 2). 14. In French, "Qu'on me donne la hache meurtri?re. Vite!" The Greek com pound adjective, androkm?ta, which describes the ax, means literally, and more pointedly, "man-slaying." 15. The Iphigeneia ends (though the authenticity of the speech is disputed) with a messenger recounting, in Clytemnestra's presence, the miraculous story of the stag suddenly appearing on the altar in place of Iphigenia. Euripides' Clytemnestra questions the veracity of the story. Creating an image of considerable effect, Mnouchkine's Clytemnestra lay on the ground, prostrate and absolutely, chill ingly, silent and still, as if unconscious, during the whole of the finale. Turning sideways but not rising, she says only, "How can I know these stories are true." Visibly crushed by her suffering, her indictment could not have been rendered more powerfully, nor Agamemnon's feeble "[Iphigeneia] has now joined the gods"</page><page sequence="30">Herbert Golder 203 more hollow. Clytemnestra remains the emotional center of this tetralogy, a far more sympathetic character than the Titanic being found in Aeschylus. The words and actions of the nurse make it emphatically clear that Clytemnestra has never been a mother to Orestes. Maintaining the victimized Clytemnestra of Euripides requires that Mnouchkine considerably soften Aeschylus' fierce androgyne, which skews, in essential ways our entire reception of Aeschylus' trilogy. The complex mediation, rite of passage, and evolution from retributive to deliberative justice that Aeschylus explores becomes a far more patent case of crime and punishment. Clytemnestra becomes, along with Iphigeneia, an utterly unambiguous character, the only character of volition who claims full responsibility, and thereby wins our sympathy, for her acts. A powerful feminist (and possibly new historicist?Euripi des as revisionist critic of Aeschylean establishment theater) interpretation, but one that radically realigns the emotional and ideational force fields of Aeschylus' plays. 16. Both Agamemnon and Menelaus were presented as black-garbed samurai (ninjas?), who spoke, sitting Mandarin-like on opposite sides of the stage, crossed legged and facing front. Throughout Iphigeneia's appeal, Agamemnon faced for ward, adamant and impassive in his samurai squat. 17. Instead, Agamemnon assumes a haughty posture upon, and is then wheeled off on, an inclined platform that was used regularly in this production to ferry char acters from the front of the stage through the middle and then below and behind the tiered audience. The device itself, a kind of ekkykl?ma in reverse (the raised platform in the Greek theater emerges from the inside, i.e., backstage, out) created forceful impressions elsewhere, as when characters were regularly trundled off fro zen into a graphic tableau vivant, or for strong and sudden entrances. But in the case of the tapestry, the technique was clearly a loss leader. 18. While it would be grossly reductive to describe Mnouchkine's art as merely promoting an ideological agenda, hers is a demonstrably feminist Oresteia, with, as has been discussed above, every effort made to render Clytemnestra sympathetic. Only the result is too often sentimentality and a corresponding oversimplification. Aeschylus put her rough edges in for a reason. But Mnouchkine has been frank about her tendentiousness, if naive about the very real and unassimilable differ ences between Aeschylus' and Euripides' Clytemnestra: "I have a deep feeling for Clytemnestra. Her husband tricks her into bringing their daughter to Aulis, where the child is to be sacrificed upon an altar. Agamemnon is a coward, afraid of what his allies will do if he does not comply. Nor does the Queen believe that her daugh ter was saved at the last moment by Artemis. All she knows is that the child has been taken away from her. She feels this privation in her flesh, and lives in expectation of taking her revenge against the killer, her husband. And when he returns at last, he does so with his concubine, the princess/prophetess Cassandra. Now the girl must be killed also. This is all in the text. I'm faithful to the texts; I invent nothing. Our duty as directors is to be good readers" (from an interview with Rosette Lamont, "Ariane Mnouchkine's Theater of History," TheaterWeek, October 5, 1992). But this is a reading of Euripides, and not Aeschylus. Her feminist impulse is so strong that Athena is made to promise the Furies at the end of the Eumenides that "In future times women will be more revered," a line not in the text. 19. "Son of the cabbage-patch goddess . . . gossip monger, dead-beat poet, rag sticher . . ." is Aeschylus' greeting for Euripides in Aristophanes' Frogs (840ff.). "One-legged poet" who "makes up verse like a whore in amorous postures" is but a taste of his further characterization.</page><page sequence="31">204 GEEK TRAGEDY??OR, WHY I'D RATHER GO TO THE MOVIES 20. It would be impossible to document the use and abuse of Greek drama fully. Plays like Euripides' Trojan Women and Hecuba have been and continue to be restaged as powerful anti-war protests. The Antigone has become, through its vari ous stagings and adaptations, a virtual symbol of the individual's revolt against tyranny. For a while in the sixties and seventies, Medea was frequently (and improbably) staged as a clarion call for women's liberation. For a good many other Greek plays it may not be so immediately apparent what modern urgency or topical cause they could serve. Peter Sellars used the Ajax to attack the military. Suzuki has used the Bacchae to expose the danger of ideology. In the fragments of Sophocles' satyr play, the Ichneutai, Tony Harrison has discovered a critique of pop culture. 21. Quoted in Arthur Holmberg, "From Lectern to Stage, New Views of Shake speare," The New York Times, Nov. 4,1984. 22. The smoking tarmac, which was itself covered with black sand, was certainly the most striking design element of this production, with its sinister suggestion of a smoldering volcano, or even the Delphic "earth-navel," from which smoke myste riously rose. The "mallets" were like small stands beside which the chorus stood when not marching or dancing. At Stratford, however, they often retreated to a boxed-off area behind the audience that made them resemble, as at least one critic has noted, game show contestants. Other elements included central (back)stage doors, through which characters entered and exited; a center stage altar when appropriate, as in the OC; above stage right and left hovered two cages full of the musical instruments played during the production; but over everything, stage and audience alike, there loomed two brightly colored balloons (the colors changed from play to play) which were, with smiley faces and zodiacal symbols, supposed to represent the gods (which is odd considering the designer, Ultz, wants us to "believe in Apollo as someone to be prayed to"). On the whole, there was something almost flippant and camp in the stage design. Sun flowers decorated the musical cages and, at the Stratford production, large, green, shamrock-shaped leaves adorned the entire theater to suggest the Furies sacred grove. 23. Bare is the best description of style and setting: a small and shallow dark stage with a close back wall made of corrugated metal sheets, with rivets displayed, like the side of a battleship or an old warehouse (one critic has compared it to the inside of a prison court), intersected at right angles by another facade with a door way and some large girders. Later, to dramatize the collapse of his house, his world, some of the upper sheets suddenly drop to the ground, though still suspended by ropes, where they are pounded furiously and clangorously by Jason. (Almost every critic has hailed this clanging set, hailing it, especially when it falls noisily at the end, as one of the highlights of the show. "The visual impact is so effective," writes the Globe critic, "it very nearly crushes Diana Rigg.") The stage itself is empty except for a wooden bench on which the three choristers, three peasant women in black shawls, sometimes sit. Above stage left, in a compartment built into the back wall (her "cell"), illuminated at the appropriate moment, sits Medea in her cham ber. This is where she retires for her epiphany over the bodies of her sons (for a dis cussion of the epiphany in the New York production see note 28). In the New York production, the play opens with Diana Rigg sitting in this compartment, sidewise and on a slight angle, facing backstage. Eerily lit, she looked like Whistler's Mother in red. 24. At its best, the chorus achieved a plaintive madrigal-like, polyphonous effect, chanting alternately in unison and antiphony. Occasionally, the lyrics added a mov ing musical dimension to the production?but only occasionally.</page><page sequence="32">Herbert Golder 205 25. Elliot notes in the published script that "Euripides' lean dialogue has been honed down to a film editor's rapidity." 26. Press Association Newsfile, June 13, 1994. For the raving unanimity of the New York critics, see, e.g., David Richards, "Amid Pain and Din, A Mighty Medea," The New York Times, April 8, 1994, Cl, 15, whose comment, "For the actress, who has always managed to suggest impeccable breeding even when she is behaving abominably, the evening is a triumph," nicely sums up Americans' infatu ation with British affectation and their equation of it with "culture." 27. "Medea," Variety, April 17,1994,161. 28. To call this an anticlimax is an understatement. The only real shock was the noise made by Jason, furiously pounding on the metal panels that dropped and hung suspended from the back wall. Above, in her illuminated compartment, stands Medea with blood-stained hands. But the bodies of the children are dis creetly dim, with their faces turned tastefully from view. Truly Medea's crime is monstrous, but the horror has here been attenuated. The production does not real ize or evoke the horror of her crime. The New York production's finale was more effective than the London original. As Medea stood within the elevated compart ment of the set, lit eerily from below, with the figures of the murdered children more distinctly visible (but then this is America), images of scudding clouds were projected onto an illuminated wall behind her. Medea stared off defiantly, as a sound of wind, rising in pitch to a howl, stifled Jason's lamentations below. 29. David Strauss, Writer and Confessor, trans, by Herbert Golder, in Unmod ern Observations (New Haven 1990), ?1. 30. This production transformed Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus into a contem porary gospel service, replete with invocation, doxology, and of course, stirring solo, choral, and ensemble gospel singing. Conceived and directed by Lee Breuer, with music composed by Bob Telson, The Gospel at Colonus was originally per formed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1983, then travelled to select Ameri can cities. The Original Soul Stirrers (with whom Sam Cooke started) and Clarence Fountain and the Five Blind Boys of Alabama were among the featured artists. Leading the service and alternately assuming the part of Oedipus (when not sung) was the actor Morgan Freeman. I was fortunate enough to see the Atlanta produc tion, which was accompanied by the unequaled choir of the Ebenezer Baptist Church. 31. Andr? Serban's Euripidean trilogy was staged in the early seventies in New York's La Mama Theater (and revived numerous time since, most recently at the 1992 Edinburgh Festival). The actors had undergone extensive vocal training in order to be able to emit these unearthly, operatic sounds and chants that character ized this production. Some of the scenes are memorable to this day: like the appear ance of Cassandra in the Trojan Women, a bare-breasted black woman wheeled in, inside a cage, emitting extraordinarily plaintive yet aggressively erotic rhythmical cries with which her entire body violently but beautifully convulsed as her voice fluted in half and quarter tones. 32. Looking to the orient for a theater more akin to that of the Greeks, at least in starkness, symbolism, and stylization, than the naturalistic drama of the West goes back at least as far as Yeats and Pound's fascination with Noh. "It may be well," Yeats wrote in 1916, "if we go to school in Asia, for the distance from life in European art has come from little but difficulty with the material_Had we been Greeks, and so but half-European, an honourable mob would have martyred</page><page sequence="33">206 GEEK TRAGEDY??OR, WHY I'D RATHER GO TO THE MOVIES though in vain the first man who set up a painted scene, or who complained that soliloquies were unnatural. . . . Therefore ... I go to Asia for a stage-convention, for more formal faces, for a chorus that has no part in the action and perhaps for those movements of the body copied from the marionette shows of the fourteenth century" (from his "Introduction to Certain Noble Plays of Japan by Pound and Fenollosa," reprinted in Pound and Fenollosa, The Classic Noh Theatre of Japan [New York 1959], 154-55). Japanese directors have also seized on this affinity between their theater and that of the Greeks. Trained in traditional Japanese the ater, Shozo Sato used the conventions of Kabuki to unleash the daimonic passions and fantastical elements in Euripides' Medea (1984). Suzuki Tadashi, who has assimilated Japanese traditional theater into a unique contemporary style, has mounted a Trojan Women (1984), a Bacchae (1991), and a Clytemnestra (1983). It is not really possible to compare the work of these directors: Kabuki enabled Sato to dramatize the magical and mythical world of Jason and Medea more effectively than most Western-style productions I have seen; but Suzuki assimilates the Greek plot into his distinctive style of avant garde theater (with strongly traditional ele ments), transforming it into a creation all his own. While undeniably powerful the ater, his was a Bacchae without a Dionysus?Dionysus was imagined as all the historical and ideological fictions that have demanded, or still demand, victims and scapegoats. There was a priest with a murderous coterie but no god, only human beings with a need for stories by which they justify themselves and which always require a victim. There was also a chorus in wheelchairs, the dispossessed, those altogether out of the conflict, and therefore removed from society. Despite the physicality of Suzuki's staging?the low stances that root his actors in the ground and their amazing capacity to speak as if from the bowels?his was the most eerily abstract conception?and conception, intellectualization, is apt?of the Bacchae I have seen. (For an excellent, and highly appreciative, discussion of his work see Marianne McDonald, Ancient Sun, Modern Light [New York 1992], 21-74.) 33. For a different view of contemporary productions, see, most recently, Mari anne McDonald, idem. Some other valuable pieces, representative of an alternative view include, Arthur Holmberg, "Greek Tragedy in a New Mask Speaks to Today's Audience," New York Times, March 1, 1987, sec. 2, Iff.; Theater: The Greeks, Vol. 11, No. 3, Summer 1980; see also, J.

Much recent criticism of tragedy betrays a highly contemporary critical agenda. The trend to "read texts" rather than to "visualize plays" is evident, not least, in the very title of one of the most influential books in this vein, Simon Goldhill's Reading Greek Tragedy (Cambridge 1986). 36. Mnouchkine controlled her audience with the same ritualistic rigor that she controlled her company. She demands nothing short of total commitment to the experience. There was, of course, no late entry (and at one woman who, for what ever reason, had to leave early, the actors seemed to break character and scowl as she exited). During intermissions, which were quite lengthy even considering the marathon nature of the event, the audience was confined to a congested, curtained off area at the rear of the seats.</page><page sequence="34">Herbert Golder 207 37.

One gets a good sense of the spectacular nature of the Aeschylean theater from Aristophanes' parody in the Frogs as well as from the fragments and extant plays. 42. In the National Theatre's Production of the Oresteia (London 1982, directed by Peter Hall and based on Tony Harrison's translation), Clytemnestra was played very ominously and effectively by a man whose mannerisms, gestures, and demeanor would abruptly change from those of a woman to those of a man, and vice versa. 43. Sophocles was said, by Aristotle, to have introduced the third actor, but our earliest example of a third speaking part comes in this play. 44. Line 900ff., which translates literally, "What then becomes of the oracles of Apollo declared by the Pythia, what of sworn oaths? Count all men as hateful to you before the gods." 45.

Odyssey, 11.271ff. 47. The only possible earlier reference to Oedipus' blinding comes in an athe tized choral passage from Aeschylus' Seven Against Thebes (784), produced in 467 BC, which describes the tragic fate of Oedipus. 48. There is no evidence for Oedipus' self-blinding, before Sophocles, in either the literary (Homer, the fragments of the epic cycle, the lyric poets) or the visual tra dition. On the literary antecedents to Sophocles' play, see H. C. Baldry, "The Dra matisation of the Theban Legend," Greece and Rome 3 (1956), 24-37; E. L. de Kock, "The Sophoclean Oedipus and its Antecedents," Acta Classica 4 (1961), 7-28; and Lowell Edmunds, Oedipus: The Ancient Legend and Its Later Ana logues (Baltimore and London 1985), esp. 13-6. In the visual arts, Oedipus is mostly represented in his confrontation with the Sphinx, his own tragic dilemmas, which so intrigued the dramatists, finding little representation (see Ingrid Krauskopf, "Oidipous," in P. Muller and C. Auge [eds.], Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae [Zurich 1981], vol. 7, pt. 1,1-15 and vol. 7, pt. 2, 6-15). 49. For the description of the Machiguengas as normally very calm when lis tening to stories, I am indebted to Allen Johnson, "Anthropology and Psychoanaly sis: Bridging Science and Humanities," in L. Adams (ed.), Psychoanalysis and the Humanities (New York 1994), 21. 50. This and other Oedipus stories from around the world will soon be published in Oedipus Ubiquitous, Alan Johnson and Douglas Price Williams, forthcoming Stanford University Press and see also, Lowell Edmunds and Alan Dundes, eds., Oedipus, A Folklore Casebook (New York 1983) and Sir James George Frazer, Apollodorus (Cambridge, Mass. 1956), Appendix VIII, vol. 2, 370-76. 51. The longest, extant, pre-Euripidean account of Medea comes in Pindar's Pythian 4, a lyric poem narrating the journey of Jason and the Argonauts and clos ing with the return of Jason and Medea to Greece. Pindar represents Medea as a</page><page sequence="35">208 GEEK TRAGEDY??OR, WHY I'D RATHER GO TO THE MOVIES prophetic benefactress. There is no hint of her infanticidal crimes. The legend that Medea was an exotic sorceress from a remote land certainly preexisted Euripides, but not that of the murders. Medea's connection to Corinth, however, appears to be a very ancient one. There were old legends (by one account, from Eumelos of Corinth, c. 740 BC, she, not Jason, is the rightful ruler of Corinth, by virtue of her descent from Helios who had assigned his son Aeetes to Corinth's throne) concern ing the death of her children and a cult established to honor them. Only fragmen tary evidence exists, but it seems that either Hera murdered Medea's children or she tricked Medea into thinking that she could make her children immortal by burying them in the goddess's temple. Euripides has clearly taken an ancient and recondite Corinthian legend, in which Medea appears to have unwittingly killed her children, and transformed it into a tale of terrible and destructive passion: his offering to Athens at the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War. 52. Tony Harrison's version of Medea {Medea: A Sex-War Opera, 1985) closes with contemporary newspaper accounts, which contemporizes Medea's crime within the context of modern psychosis. 53.1 recently saw a Black Medea (an adaptation by Ernest Ferlita, Actor's Outlet Theatre, New York, 1990) which was set in Louisiana in the early nineteenth cen tury. Medea was a beautiful and exotic native princess, the Haitian wife of an aris tocrat of French extraction who had been forced by revolution to flee his lands in Haiti for New Orleans. The daughter of the island's former king, Medea is of course schooled in the arts of voodoo. Upon being abandoned by her husband for a new, white, bride, Medea uses her black magic against them. The production res onated with powerful chants of Damballah, the Macumba serpent god, and the whole play, from Medea's very first speech, was a calculated and impassioned cre scendo of revenge: "I can't bear to look at my children without wanting to tear him out of their flesh" were among her first (and highly un-Euripidean) words to the chorus, who were continuously inciting her to vengeance. At the end of the play, after she has committed the murders, it is not into the "new" world that Medea is finally delivered, as Euripides' Medea is imported into Athens, but to Africa that she and the primal passions she embodies are returned. 54. In Shozo Sato's celebrated Kabuki Medea (which originated in Urbana in 1984 and toured Chicago, Washington, and the West Coast), Medea is, when the moment for revenge is ripe, actually transformed into a fierce-looking demonic creature, with a wild mane of hair and stripes painted across her face. 55. This is certainly the expectation that the nurse raises at the beginning of Euripides' play and which her subsequent appearances?her initial, reasonable sounding, modestly self-effacing words to the chorus, or the agony she goes through and that balks her just before she murders the children?defeats and, as I have argued, enormously complicates. 56. In fact, the film features the international film star Melina Mercouri as the actress playing Medea. Dassin had seen her in a production of Medea at the time the idea for this film was germinating. 57. It may also be worth noting that it is during a production of Electra that the actress heroine of Persona is struck dumb. 58. As noted above, Dassin's film was partly inspired by Mercouri's stage perfor mance of this role and his discovery, around the same time, of a Medea-like story in the Italian newspapers and his subsequent attendance at the trial. However, Dassin, Mercouri, and Medea go back at least as far as 1960, when, in his celebrated film,</page><page sequence="36">Herbert Golder 209 Never on Sunday, Mercouri plays a spirited modern Greek prostitute whose favor ite play happens to be Medea (which she has seen countless times), and whose ending she willfully emends in her retelling: the murder, as she "remembers" it was a ruse that Medea invented to win back Jason; it works, so in the end they all go gaily off to the seashore! The American professor, Homer (played by Dassin him self), is at pains to enlighten her about, among other things, the ending of the play. 59. The "real" Medea is played by Ellen Burstyn. 60. Of course, early opera was a serious attempt to recreate Greek tragedy during the Renaissance: it evolved out of the rediscovery of Greek drama and a creative and inspired misunderstanding of the role of lyrics and music within it, combined natu rally with the rich madrigal tradition of Italy. In the nineteenth century Wagner redefined opera by returning to Greek tragedy. From it he evolved his notion of Gesamtkuntswerk and from the Oresteia in particular came his inspiration for the Ring. 61. Herodotus 6.21.2 62. Gussow was comparing Sellars's deconstructionism unfavorably with Peter Brook's reconstructionism: "In their approach to the classics, Mr. Sellars and cer tain other directors can be categorized as deconstructionists, tearing apart a text, shuffling its parts and leaving the skeleton exposed. In contrast, Mr. Brook is a reconstructionist, looking beneath the text and behind decades of encrusted tradi tion to find the heartbeat of the play-[B]y freeing a play from unnecessary trap pings, Mr. Brook allowed us to share the timelessness of masterpieces" ("Unadorned but Complex Chekhov," The New York Times, January 30,1988).</page></plain_text>
