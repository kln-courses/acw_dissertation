<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BLUEJAY CHARACTER IN THE PLATEAU SPIRIT DANCE By VERNE F. RAY PERHAPS nowhere in America did the guardian spirit concept play so great a role in the lives of a people as among the Salishan groups of the Plateau. Long ago James Teit made this discovery in his work with the Salish of interior British Columbia, and his descriptions of their beliefs and practices' furnished both the type picture2 and a considerable bulk of documentary material for Dr Benedict's subsequent study of the concept for North America generally. More recent studies have demonstrated a similar intensity of the concept among the Salish of interior Washington.3 Not only was the guardian spirit idea highly developed here as a formal religious complex in which very nearly every man participated, but that participation was no passive acquiescence to cultural tradition. It was rather an intense identification highly charged with emotional content. This emotional intensity reached its peak during the winter period of spirit dances in which all those possessing guardians participated. But this winter period was not a time when otherwise absentee spirits returned or were recalled for sake of the ceremony, as, for example, in nearby Puget Sound. For here spirits were ever present. A man and his tutelary led parallel existences; the one had only to reach out, so to speak, and draw the other to him when the occasion made unitary action or cooperation desirable. The power inherent in the possession of a guardian spirit was not, in other 1 James Teit, The Lillooet Indians (Publications, Jesup North Pacific Expedition, Vol. 2, pp. 193-300, 1906); The Shuswap (same series, Vol. 2, pp. 443-789, 1909); The Thompson Indians of British Columbia (same series, Vol. 1, pp. 163-392, 1900); The Salishan Tribes of the Western Plateaus, Franz Boas, ed. (Report, Bureau of American Ethnology, Vol. 45, pp. 23- 396, 1930). 2 "The type picture of the North American guardian-spirit practices corresponds most nearly to the customs of the Plateau area, let us say the Thompson River Indians (Teit: Thompson Indians). There was here the isolation in the mountains at puberty, the long cere- monial purification, the intentness upon supernatural communication, and the acquisition of the name and power and song of the guardian spirit in a vision. For months or even years the youths carried out strict dietary regulations with frequent rigid fasts; purged themselves with medicine and induced vomiting by pliant sticks; purified themselves by sweat bathing, followed by a plunge into the cold stream. There were no limitations of rank or ownership upon the experience or the tutelary spirits; the quest was open to and incumbent upon all the young men of the tribe" (Ruth Benedict, The Concept of the Guardian Spirit in North America, Memoir, American Anthropological Association, No. 29, 1923, p. 10.) 3 Verne F.

Over-formalization in ethnographic accounts has obscured this fact. In everyday life this intimacy of relationship was reflected in countless references to one's own or another's tutelary, and in the invariable explana- tion of all unusual, impressive, or significant occurrences in terms of spirit power. Reference to one's own spirit was never specific, however, but always couched in vague or generic terms: "my power," "my helper," or, in colloquial English, "my partner." This last expression, heard constantly among these peoples even today, reflects most accurately the native atti- tude toward spirit power.4 Another key to the depth of the personal relationship is the spirit-ghost concept. When a man died his tutelary did not return to its genus, dis- appear, or merely become non-existent. It was inconceivable that an entity so intimately associated with the deceased should not undergo a major transformation likewise. Consequently, the spirit "died" also, becoming thereby transformed to a spirit-ghost, one of a class of supernatural beings closely resembling in form the ghost of the soul. The identifying character- istics of the spirit were no longer retained, the new form being vaguely anthropomorphic.5 The full distribution of the spirit-ghost concept is not yet determined, but it is known for the Southern Okanogan,6 Sanpoil, Nespelem, Kalispel, Wenatchi, and Kittitas. It apparently is present in modified form among the Lakes (Senijextee), but is definitely absent for the Klikitat. The winter dance was mentioned above as the period when spirit con- sciousness reached the point of saturation. Impersonation of guardian spirits was a well recognized feature of the ceremony. Another aspect, far more instructive for a fundamental understanding of the complex, was identification-as opposed to mere impersonation-with the spirit. Identifi- cation involved radical and thorough transformation from the normal human state to a condition in which all social relationships were abjured, and activities duplicated, as closely as physical limitations permitted, those of the spirit. Such identification may seem to do violence to the strongly developed duality principle. To resolve this apparent difficulty it is necessary to recall the native theory of genesis for the guardian spirit. During mythological * Cf. Ray, loc. cit.

But the beings of that time possessed attributes of both. Their physical and psychological differentiae were those of animals, but for the most part they appeared in the superficial guise of men. The animal form as such was taken only when an emergency demanded. They sought no spirit power since they possessed it inherently. "When people came on earth," it is explained, "these beings became the spirits." But in the new era the dominant form became that of the animal; the man-like form was taken only when in communion with men. Human beings appeared at the same time, inheriting as their guise the prevalent form of the previous beings. But men did not receive the power to reciprocate with their spirits and appear in animal form. This was possible, in modification, only in ceremonial identification. This identification was not an amalgamation or a substitution, but a re- version to the conceptualized form of the mythological being. Such transformation was peculiarly the prerogative of persons with Bluejay7 power; thus the term "Bluejay character" may conveniently be used for purposes of designation. Despite the dramatic nature and theoreti- cal implications of this aspect of the dance it has been largely overlooked.8 A short summary of the Sanpoil form will serve as a basis for discussion. Subject to the transformation were those with either Bluejay or Owl as tutelary. With the approach of the winter period given over to guardian spirit dances (December, January) these individuals removed all clothing except the breechcloth, and blackened the face, hands, and feet. For the two months of the dances they donned no clothing despite rigors of the weather. They shunned "human beings" and avoided conversation, even among themselves. Further, they ate apart, becoming scavengers of refuse from meals and stale food (in keeping with the habits of bluejay and owl). During the dances they acted as sentries, patrolling the grounds outside the dance house or perching on the rafter supports inside the building. From the latter vantage point they observed intently the actions of those below to detect any breach of the formal rules of conduct. If one were seen eating during the dance, for example, the sentry "flew down and recovered the food from the person's throat." In like manner other rules were en- forced. The sentries themselves never danced or mingled with the dancers. 7 The terms bluejay and owl are here capitalized when the guardian spirit or the dance character is intended; uncapitalized, the reference is to the bird as such. 8 In 1932 I described the Sanpoil form (op. cit., pp. 191 f.); in 1933 Dr Harry Turney- High provided a description for the Flathead (The Bluejay Dance, American Anthropologist, Vol. 35, 1933, pp. 103-107); an account for the Colville is contained in Cline (op. cit.). I am aware of no others.</page><page sequence="4">596 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 39, 1937 Sometimes they disappeared from the dance for a time to perform similar duties in other parts of the village; restrictions of conduct during a dance applied to the village as a whole. The sentries were capable of detecting violations, no matter where they occurred. Similarly, they perceived the approach of visitors long before the dance house was reached; this informa- tion was conveyed to the dancers by symbolic actions. When the dance season ended it became necessary to capture the sentries in order to return them to their former state, Though the original metamorphoses had been achieved by the characters themselves, they were powerless to effect the retransformation. In fact they violently opposed it. They were caught by being waylaid by friends, whereupon they "died." Through being held over a smudge they were revivified as normal human beings. Had they been allowed to go their way, "they would have gone wild and run themselves to death."' The Colville are adjacent to the Sanpoil on the north. From Walter Cline we have the following description which is quoted in full: Among the Colville, power derived from the bluejay differed from any recorded for the [Southern] Okanagon, for it especially enabled its possessor to find lost articles and people, and sometimes impelled him to flee human society and lead an insane life in the woods. Bluejay shamans"1 used black face-paint. A man with this power once disappeared from a settlement near Marcus just after the winter dance and was not found till the next autumn. His brother dreamed that he might be discovered with a group of wild horses at noon on the day following the dream. Enlisting the aid of a few good ropers, the brother went out to capture him. They found him as foretold in the dream, leaping from one horse's back to another. The horses escaped, but the maniac was bound, fumigated with xacxac" root, and re- stored to normal life. David, the narrator, knew of no other instance of this kind, but Johnnie's account of the behavior of Colville bluejay shamans when they went out to find lost things, and the repeated statement that they "turned into bluejays," indicate a much more violent form of spirit possession than occurred among the Okanagon. Johnnie recounted that those with this power turned into bluejays at a dance, which no one was allowed to leave. They would fly through a crack in the door. They would stay naked in the mountains for months, living only on pitch. One such named inyas (Aeneas, Ignace ?) could jump up a tree and dance with one foot on its tip. People "spoke backward" to him. If a man was lost in the mountains 9 Ray, loc. cit. 10 Apparently the word shaman here is intended to convey a meaning analagous to my term character. Cline in general uses the word shaman in a very broad sense. It is certain from my own acquaintance with the Colville that there could be no confusion between the Blue- jay character and the true shaman. 11 This is a small plant, found in the mountains, which was valued for the fragrant odor characteristic of the root. The Sanpoil used it both as a perfume and a medicine.</page><page sequence="5">RAY] BLUEJAY CHARACTER IN PLATEAU SPIRIT DANCE 597 or drowned, or if horses were lost, he was asked to find them. He hopped out on one foot; reporting on his return, "I did not find him," meaning the reverse. Another named q!aI'Iya would hop out and find a coin secreted in the snow. In all the cases given, the shamans had possessed their bluejay power for some time; we obtained no account of their conduct soon after getting the power.12 These data place the Southern Okanogan definitely outside the area of the Bluejay character. For the Colville, it introduces two new or modified features: the ability to find lost objects or persons; and the "talking back- LAKE5 L A KI:"S?  -"MONTANA-" ~Rm o 1V'rA N A WASH!

Also, Owl has disappeared as a participant, and, to anticipate, will not reappear. Among the Spokane, adjoining the Sanpoil on the east, a new element appears in the participation of the Bluejay character in the dance as a pseudo-shaman. Treatment was limited, however, to cases where the peculiar attributes of the bluejay indicated aptitude. Thus, just as among the Sanpoil the sentry retrieved food from a person's throat, among the Spokane he withdrew from a patient's stomach foreign matter which in- advertently had been swallowed. 12 Cline, op. cit.</page><page sequence="6">598 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 39, 1937 The Kalispel, immediately north of the Spokane and east of the Colville, extended this curing power to include one of the typical shamanistic pro- cedures, that of sucking. Bluejay characters were paid by ailing dancers to treat those illnesses for which sucking was deemed proper. They were not privileged to use the other shamanistic modes of treatment, namely blowing and drawing out with the hands."l The Bluejays were definitely set apart from true shamans and contrasted to them. Informants emphasized this distinction by pointing out that true shamans never were paid.'4 The talent for ferreting out the missing is encountered here also. The phrasing is closely parallel to that of the Colville, especially in the interest expressed over objects recovered from under the snow. Thus one informant told how his father had regained a knife by enlisting the services of a Bluejay during a winter dance. The knife had been lost the previous summer; it was found at some distance under three feet of snow. It was explained that this power of the Bluejay was limited to such objects as contained material derived from animal life. If this provision were met, success was certain regardless of distance or elapsed time. The knife in question had had a handle of buckhorn; had it been of wood the Bluejay would have been powerless. The Kalispel characters observed a "complete" fast of water as well as food for as long as eight days, the duration of the dance. Clothing was not shunned as uniformly as among the Sanpoil, this being largely an individual matter. Likewise, some blackened their faces and hands, some did not. The transfdrmations occurred during the first hours of the dance, not prior to it. Bluejays often left the vicinity of the dance house, remaining away for several hours or a whole night. But contrary to Sanpoil custom, the nature of these escapades was keptistrictly secret, even from one another." The revivification and return to normal was sometimes accomplished by smudg- ing but more often by shamanistic treatment. The shaman in charge of the dance, or another practitioner, allayed the condition by the common drawing out and blowing procedure. South of the Kalispel and east of the Spokane lay the Coeur d'Alene. Here familiar elements are encountered together with new ones and a strong emphasis upon Bluejay as a seer is discerned. Like the Sanpoil they blackened the face and hands, wore nothing but the breechcloth, sat among the roof poles, and strictly avoided the dancers. Sentry duties were likewise similar but somewhat more formalized in that a badge of authority in the 13 Cf. Ray, op. cit., pp. 205 f. 14 But they might receive presents. This distinction may seem artificial, but to the Kalis- pel it is very real and strongly defended. 15 This explains the "eight day complete fast."</page><page sequence="7">RAY] BLUEJAY CHARACTER IN PLATEAU SPIRIT DANCE 599 form of a diminutive bow and arrows were carried. The Coeur d'Alene sentry was not exempt from the food tabus but was restricted to the same degree as the dancers. As a seer the Bluejay was not only able to find lost or hidden objects or persons but made a point of using this knowledge to the embarrassment of the dancers, by calling down to the audience from his perch in the rafters and disclosing secret activities, tabu violations, and other irregular actions on the part of members. The foretelling of events with great specificity was likewise characteristic. Speech with the dancers was not restricted. In keeping with the character of the bird, the Bluejay was said to travel with great speed, ignoring impediments. The characters travelled from one dance to another throughout the dance period. No pseudo-shamanistic attributes were possessed. Here even more than else- where the Bluejay resisted being returned to the human state. Informants tell of pursuits over many miles of snow covered ground before the capture of one or another Bluejay could be effected. Once caught, the retransforma- tion was accomplished by holding live coals covered with aromatic roots under the subject's nose. Smudging the whole body was never practiced. Among the Flathead, east of the Coeur d'Alene and Kalispel, the com- plex appears, at first glance, to have been considerably altered in character. Turney-High writes: The Dance of the Bluejay is probably the principal expression of the hopes and woes of the Montana Salish. .... 1 Three days before the ceremony is to begin, the shamans, who are called quas- quays in Salishan, assemble.... Their personal "medicine," called in Salishan sumesh... is usually in the form of an animal who became the guardian of the man at the time he developed into a quasquay. When... the dance of the second night begins, the sick lie down before the quasquays.... Should, for example, the sumesh of the quasquay be the Bluejay, he will throw a feather into the vital organs of an enemy [to cause illness or to demonstrate power in the dance contests]. By this time in the dance [second night], the Bluejay sumesh has begun to possess the quasquays.... The old men of the assembly decide that it is time to allow the quasquays to "go wild." . . . At this the quasquays are entirely possessed by the Bluejay, in fact become bluejays, and begin to "speak in tongues." ... Chirping and cawing they ascend the lodgepoles and run about the rafters with remarkable agility.... The "Bluejays" are permitted to "go wild" until the beginning of the third night. Then the old men ... smoke the spell out of them." 16 Turney-High uses the term Salish for the group more commonly called Flathead. The name Salish is ambiguous since it is more widely used to designate the extensive linguistic stock to which Flathead speech belongs. 17 Turney-High, op. cit., pp. 103-105.</page><page sequence="8">600 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 39, 1937 Translations of the native terms used above are required before this data can be interpreted.'8 Turney-High's word "sumesh" is simply the familiar Salishan term for guardian spirit (Sanpoil: sumi'xu; Southern Okanogan: sumi'x; Lakes: su'mi'xu), while "quasquay"is the common term for bluejay (Sanpoil: qwa'skei; Coeur d'Alene: qwa'sqwel; Klallam: kwa'ckwac'l). But if the native terms in the quotations above are translated confusion still prevails.20 It is obvious that Turney-High, after incorrectly equating the terms shaman and "quasquay," proceeds to use them inter- changeably. This at once accounts for the apparent transformation of all shamans into Bluejay characters, regardless of their tutelaries; resolves the contradiction in the statement that the guardian spirit is the animal that becomes the patron of the Bluejay; and renders meaningful the tautological statements. The identification of the shaman with the Bluejay might be accepted at face value were it asserted for Flathead ("Salish"'16) culture. A step in this direction was found among the neighboring Kalispel. But Turney-High presents the identity as a feature of the Salishan language ("called in Salishan") which has been shown to be false. The "Bluejay Dance" of the Flathead was merely the familiar winter guardian spirit dance of the Plateau, telescoped to comprise but four days of activity. Bluejay characters played a somewhat greater role than among groups to the west, but on the first and fourth days, half the duration of the ceremony, there were no distinctive features of the Bluejay complex. In the quotations above appear direct parallels with the spirit dance elsewhere (power contests, shamanistic curing). Other analogues include purification rites, ritual preparation of the dancing ground, guardian spirit dancing, similar formal rules of conduct, ritual quenching of the fires, a ritual expedi- is Without such translation it would appear from the first remarks that the actors in the dance were true shamans and that all such participated. This would imply that all shamans possessed Bluejay as guardian, or that participation in the "Bluejay Dance" was not limited to those with this power. But this will not hold in view of the statements, "Should, for example, the sumesh of the quasquay be the Bluejay," and, "the Bluejay sumesh has begun to possess the quasquays." This implies that shamans possessing guardians other than Blue- jay nevertheless "become bluejays." 19 Herman Haeberlin, Types of Reduplication in the Salishan Dialects (International Jour- nal of American Linguistics, Vol. 1, pp. 154-74, 1918). p. 167. 20 We then read: "the shamans, who are called bluejays in Salishan;" "their personal 'medicine,' called . . . guardian spirit ... is usually in the form of an animal who became the guardian of the man at the time he developed into a bluejay;" "the sick lie down before the bluejays;" "Should, for example, the guardian spirit of the bluejay be the Bluejay;" "the Bluejay guardian spirit has begun to possess the bluejays;" and, "At this the bluejays are entirely possessed by the Bluejay, in fact become bluejays."</page><page sequence="9">RAY] BLUEJA Y CHARACTER IN PLATEAU SPIRIT DANCE 601 tion to bring in the center pole, branches allowed to remain on the center pole, giving of gifts, and dancing for weather control. The Bluejay feature itself exhibits numerous parallels with groups dis- cussed above. Transformation occurred after the opening of the dance, as with the Kalispel. The old men (presumably the shamans) decided to let those With Bluejay power "go wild," that is, become transformed. Meta- morphosis was complete; the characters perched among the rafters; retransformation was accomplished through smudging. Further perusal of Turney-High's text reveals many other parallels, including: lack of clothing, blackening of the face, duty as sentries, fasting, curing, specialization in curing, no conversation with human beings, and inability to retransform themselves.21 The expanded curing role of the Flathead Bluejay character deserves emphasis. But the questions, "Were the Bluejays true shamans; did they practice curing apart from the dance?" can be answered in the negative with reasonable safety. On the whole, the Bluejay complex of the Flathead fits well into the general pattern. The distribution of the Bluejay character now apparently is exhausted, with the possible exception of the Kutenai. I was unable to visit this group, but the southern Kutenai, at least, may very well have shared the trait. Lakes (Senijextee) and Columbia informants declared the complex was unknown to their groups. It was absent, as we have seen, for the Southern Okanogan. Spinden does not mention it for the Nez Perc6.22 For peoples to the east of the Flathead the complex is not mentioned, to my knowledge, in the existing literature. The accompanying map shows the probable boundaries of the Bluejay complex.23 UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 21 Turney-High, op. cit., passim. 22 Herbert J.
