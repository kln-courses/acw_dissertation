<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Double Trap of Robbe-Grillet: A Reading of Le Voyeur KATHY J. PHILLIPS Despite Barthes' early recognition that Robbe-Grillet writes about writing,1 Robbe-Grillet must still counter definition as either the totally "objective" author, the one who would give the fullest description of a tomato, or, the completely "subjective" author, projecting the obsessive vision that could transform a squashed insect into an erotic symbol. (At times Robbe-Grillet has fueled these debates, but his basic stance is outside these categories.) His works reveal neither "objects in them- selves," nor the workings of consciousness, but rather reveal their own devices, as art. Robbe-Grillet's works unroll ambiguously along lines of constant temptation. Their stock plots and type characters-the murder mys- tery, the jealous husband-when just barely hinted at make us fill in a whole range of conventional associations before they are really sup- ported by the text. Innocent word juxtapositions, such as "fille" with "ficelle," or "circumstantial evidence," such as suggestive movie posters or hands lying too closely, lead us to construe typical adventures. When the final word fails to confirm these adventures, we are hardly pre- pared to admit that we have read a book about a swatted bug or a squashed frog-or about the buildup of words on a page! However, this literal-mindedness is just the experience which Robbe-Grillet con- sistently prepares for us. Not only do we speculate, but the text itself generates more con- crete supportive detail after a first hint. Metaphors appear to mate- rialize ("shadow like an insect" becomes "shadow of an insect" in Dans le labyrinthe), pictures are animated, one word "leads to another." In this sense, our "wildest interpretations" or most conventional readings are 323</page><page sequence="2">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE justified. However, Robbe-Grillet carefully introduces contradictions to discourage faith in a realistic anecdote. He substitutes, though, another interpretation for the prohibited stories and themes: an elaborate ref- erence to the work of art itself. While he vigorously denies any tran- scendent "beyond" to his descriptions ("sentimental, sociologique, freudien, metaphysique, ou autre," calling all interpretations "inutiles, superflues, voire malhonnetes"), ironically, one "other" category, aes- thetic, still lies beyond or behind his writing.2 As Robbe-Grillet creates the expectation of a story that never quite materializes, the "near miss" convinces us not so much of the impossi- bility of lifelike characters or believable plots (though such creations remain under the suspicion that has dogged them throughout the twentieth century), but instead reminds us of the tricks of plot motiva- tion, suspended disbelief, and symbolic interpretation that have made up our learned processes of reading-and still do. That is, we are invited to appreciate the subtlety of our involvement with texts, rather than to reject the conventions entirely. Similarly, the contradictions in plot line or detail are not meant to expose a tragically "unknowable" world. They expose a fictional world where the one thing we know for sure is that an author-for all his invitation to us to speculate freely in "open" strucures-has us still firmly in hand. Most of Robbe-Grillet's descriptions have a dual reference: to some physical object and to some aspect of writing. Snow which changes direction erratically reminds us of plot line which shifts tack every few pages. An artificial wood-grain panel, elaborately mimetic yet unable to conceal its artificiality, resembles the texture of the story in which it appears, rich with physical detail but unreal. In addition, characters may represent "reader," "character," and "author" figures (as we will see in Le Voyeur). These allegories, along with the veiled descriptions and arrested plots, remain a real paradox for an author who claims no ulterior "meaning." But we come to recognize these internal references, to some aspect of literature in general, or to his particular method of construction, as typical of Robbe-Grillet. We learn to read "through" these signs, as surely as we may have read the wandering of the soldier (Dans le labyrinthe) as angst from an existentialist point of view. Now that we are forbidden to interpret detail tragically, we still interpret reflexively: Dans le labyrinthe as coercion of character. Essentially, Robbe-Grillet makes us question symbolic readings: the ability to read through literal notation to secondary meaning, and to connect plot detail into story sequence. On another level, though, Robbe-Grillet prepares for an equally precarious "symbolic" reading of 324</page><page sequence="3">A READING OF LE VOYEUR his works which he does not question. Not only do we make rash jumps from meticulous descriptions of coiled rope to assume stranglings, but, as we have seen, we then come to read the stranglings and other violent scenes as shorthand for some literary process. That is, the detective in Les Gommes kills-a literary tradition. Le Voyeur chronicles the seduction of-the reader. While Robbe-Grillet condemns the first jump from "rope" to "strangling" as never entirely justified inference, a dangerous confu- sion of life and art, he never warns us of any danger in the second symbolic reading, from "strangling" to "seducing the reader." As his works become more insistently violent, though, we have to work harder and harder to accept the metaphoric conversion unprotestingly. We may wonder finally at the healthiness of an ability to write off murders as the death of the Oedipus tradition, especially as we confront the torture scenes in Pour une revolution a New York. Could these scenes possibly be metaphor for the "normal" manipulation of reader by author, or the inevitable subjection of character to writer? The violence in Le Voyeur may be read as just such a literary allegory, with the caution, however, that the training this book provides in allegory may not be the best defense against gratuitous violence in literature (in Robbe-Grillet's later works, for example), or even against coercion in life, if ability to "see through" unsavory detail carries over to damp necessary indignation in real situations. Le Voyeur closes in on its imputed subject-the possible crime of Mathias against Jacqueline-by means of extraordinarily subtle word- plays and word "plants," so that actually the story evolves out of word modulations and subliminal effects; by means of confusion of imagined and "real" scenes; and by means of an accumulation of circumstantial evidence that testifies more to the way we are trained to read signs and make connections in books than to any of Mathias' "real actions." The opening "siren" of the boat whistle brings with it implications of "temptress"-perhaps preparing us for Jacqueline. Instead, the words themselves as they are aligned on the page perhaps tempt the reader into drawing inferences, reconstructing a crime, assuming a violence that may be, after all, as jarring but evanescent as the whistle vapor. The reader is warned that the violence may be all conjectural, all in the mind of a reader trapped into drawing conclusions where there are none: "La sirene emit un second sifflement, aigu et prolonge, suivi de trois coups rapides, d'une violence a crever les tympans-violence sans objet, qui demeura sans resultat."3 325</page><page sequence="4">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE The passengers introduced on the first page are, in their strained effort to see across distances and bridge gaps, in the same position as readers striving to get a foothold in the volume: "... une serie de regards franchissaient-tentaient de franchir-luttaient contre cet es- pace declinant qui les separait encore de leur but" (p. 9). We, too, are led to expect goals and final conclusions, but this may well be a book without them. Mathias won't participate in their anxiety-or answer the expectation that we as readers have of him: "Legerement a l'ecart, en arriere du champ [already framed, as in an art work] que venait de decrire la fumee, un voyageur restait etranger a cette attente" (p. 9). He won't be lured into depth, motives, or a life. Similarly, Jacqueline, the other character supposed to play an important role, has hardly any more definite trait than pure "character potential": "Toujours a courir ou elle ne devrait pas, a faire arriver des histoires" (p. 110). The object in view-of the passengers, the gulls, the girl-is always ambiguous. Each looks at one thing or another-or "nothing at all." Frequently, though, the starers look at an image of themselves. The passengers see a row of people on the dock who look exactly like themselves: reflexivity par excellence! A system of doubles-passenger and passenger, gull and gull, whistle and whistle-requires a frame of description for each item that can be used and reused: each description comes to us "in a certain way," to show off the fact that someone is writing, rather than for the sake of the object. When Mathias himself becomes double for a paragraph (p. 222), the schism, perhaps psycho- logical, the indication of a guilty conscience, is brought about literally and simply by the verbal means of separating "Mathias" and "voy- ageur," which have designated him indiscriminately. Two waitresses in two cafes, alike in many details, are initially described as if the second possessed the same awkwardness as the first-when the description sud- denly switches, halfway through the second rendition, to portray an experienced, assured employee. One has the impression that the words take the route of least resistance, that they "like" to rhyme. We are warned that similarities need not mean identity, just as the posture of an actress in a movie poster need not be transferable to Jacqueline- though our training in incorporating every detail into symbolic readings of setting would suggest such a transfer. Mathias, already suggesting any Robbe-Grillet character in his ex- plicit aloofness, assumes several other "literary" roles. As commercial traveler, his two activities, "prospecting" and "leaving empty-handed," portray the reader's dogged efforts to follow up likely prospects to 326</page><page sequence="5">A READING OF LE VOYEUR make sense-frequently coming up against false leads, however. As part of his job, Mathias is engaged in making up stories. Figuring that the success of this trip to the island depends on his ability to ingratiate himself with his customers, he establishes hypothetical relationships with the islanders: "Ensemble ils auraient explore, a marree basse, les regions rarement decouvertes que peuplent des formes a la vrai- semblance equivoque" (p. 32). Naturally, in the convention of the mystery story, the plot which we see trying to take shape cannot be interesting unless equivocal, shady-but we may be disappointed. Every detail, even Mathias' existence, is ambiguous, rather than details of psychological motive only. Nothing is fixed as Mathias sets out on his itinerary. Like the writer and reader at this point in the book, he is busy marshaling bits and pieces of information which he has carefully gathered for making a plausible show as native son. "Dans son metier, il n'y avait pas de detail superflu" (p. 33). Similarly, it is unlikely that readers-or, supposedly, good writers-would admit the detail that does not prove its significance in the pattern. Consequently, every candy wrapper and cigarette butt must be preserved like precious treasures in case of "other" interpretations. If Mathias makes up stories, others make up stories about him. We hear several times that "on lui avait souvent raconte cette histoire": for instance, the anecdotes that as a child he collected string or drew a gull. His family didn't understand his penchant for cord collecting, "puisque lui, de toute faqon, n'en faisait rien" (p. 30). The reader will hardly remember, or accept, this judgment of Mathias "doing nothing," as we constantly encounter references to him, cord, and Jacqueline on the same page: the three must certainly have something to do with each other! Nevertheless, the cord which he finds on the dock may have been tossed there "par megarde ... en vue d'une utilisation future-ou bien d'une collection" (p. 10). As readers we will pocket almost any detail, saving it, to see how it fits the plan-though we are warned that these patterns might be all a child's game, a collection, display-to-no- purpose-but-itself. In the final analysis, no one interpretation of these marks on a page stands out more clearly than any other. Eventually, just the page stands out, as it does in the gull-drawing memory. "La page blanche du cahier constituait l'unique tache vraiment claire, avec peut-etre aussi le visage de l'enfant-et, a la rigueur, ses mains" (p. 18). Similarly, the lining of his valise remains basically only a marked page. 327</page><page sequence="6">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE "Mais, si l'on ne regardait pas de tres pres, on ne distinguait rien: seulement des taches de couleur vives pointillant une toile creme ..." (p. 23). A final reader figure, Julien Marek, "modifiant a son gre signes et itineraires du temps revolu" (p. 214), differs from the earlier, groping figures of readers who are just beginning a book, in that he "knows"; we are, by the time Julien is introduced, nearly as smug, disposing of several incriminating clues. Reader is voyeur, overlooking from his comfortable armchair the actions of others. In addition to the reader figures, there are several dispensers of contradictory information who effectively represent the author. Two characters in authority, patron and patronne, display attitudes similar to ones which may be imputed to Robbe-Grillet's ideal of the author: neutrality, absence of "arriere-pensee," an air of speaking "for the sake of speaking," a professional manner, but, in addition, a certain hesi- tancy, as if "II se tairait, aussi bien" (pp. 111, 245). Once he has introduced these representatives of reader, writer, and character, Robbe-Grillet prepares for their interaction. He very subtly "primes" the reader to expect violence through a deliberate use of charged words. "Celui-ci aurait a coup suir fait l'affaire" (p. 10) means that the cord would have qualified to go into the childhood box, but "fait l'affaire" is conveniently ambiguous and open to any need of Mathias; we also brush against the word "coup" to start the backdrop of violence. The cord is described "soigneusement roulee en forme de huit, avec quelques spires supplementaires serrees a l'etranglement." This simple account of the way cord is wound and secured with an end adroitly introduces the notion of strangling to a story that here-and perhaps throughout-is more innocent than that. Later Mathias cannot move quickly enough through the line of debarking passengers, who "etranglait dangereusement la file" (p. 39). Here we have an object for the strangling: not yet "fille," but close enough. The twine and the girl mentioned immediately afterward are de- liberately confused: "belle prise" and "tordue" could apply to either. "File" follows "ficelle," and we will soon perceive the "voyeur," which appears in the title only, hidden within "voyageur": as if the story were being generated from the words themselves. The sequence sown in the opening paragraphs-"ficelle," "aurait fait l'affaire," "etranglement," "petite fille," "belle prise," "tordue"-finds its capping detail in "ongles pointues": out of this innocent detail of fingernails, from our associ- ations with devils and vampires, we soon have the whole story of torturer and victim and means, in advance! In addition, the water 328</page><page sequence="7">A READING OF LE VOYEUR makes a "bruit de gifle" and is violently "brassee": stirred up, but also "brewed," as the plotting we attribute to Mathias. An "excroissance rougeatre," nothing more than rust, by this time can't help but suggest blood. At a turning point in the road that is also the turning point of the book, between Parts I and II, we read that Mathias "n'a plus qu'a se laisser descendre" (p. 87). On the skids of crime? To the bottom of the hill, no doubt; or, at any rate, according to the inevitable momentum of words built up thus far. The crushed frog in the road at this turning point may well be the most tangible evidence of violence in the book. Sly indicators constantly send us back to the most banal interpretations for every suspicious event. Mathias' first recognizable lie, that he went to the Marek farm, may not be an alibi at all, but the way to make an impression-and sell a watch; and when the victim's sister announces that she searched for Mathias-sure enough, to buy a watch-Mathias comments, "Voila donc le fin mot de l'histoire!" (p. 124). At the bottom of it all might be-the most ordinary of daily occurrences, the purchase of a watch or an accident with a frog. But it must be admitted that direct statements of Mathias' cruelty do begin to appear near the end of the book, as if the words had started to "take themselves seriously": mere metaphors or chance similarities, "fille" with "ficelle," begin to assume a necessary connec- tion, begin to "materialize," as events that may be incorporated into the account. Occurrences that are originally part of evident imagination are later part of apparent fact. Mathias does finally go to the farm to "transformer la contreverite en simple anticipation" (p. 188). The false tale of the bicycle later "happens." The force of words establishes a virtual world that we accept. Robbe-Grillet frequently uses a description of objects in Le Voyeur to suggest a simultaneous description of the book. The tentative cre- ation and denial of possible story line, alternate revelation and mystifi- cation, show up in a penchant for "self-effacing" objects: vapor from the boat whistle "aussitot apparu qu'evanoui" (p. 9) and water spots "vite assechee" (p. 16). The dock comprises a system of lines that have the same parallels, inverses, and bifurcations as the various segments of the book, and the same "blurring perspectives." The roads are as confusing as the plot; even the bicycle, with all its "new-fangled" con- traptions, displays a "superfetation" and likelihood to break down, like Robbe-Grillet's concoctions. An artificial wood-grain panel has knots as suspicious as the untenable yet concrete facts of the book: "bien que de facture en un sens realiste, ils presentaient une perfection de lignes 329</page><page sequence="8">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE sortant presque de la vraisemblance, un visage somme tout artificiel a force de paraitre concerte, comme si les accidents eux-memes y eussent repondu a des lois. II aurait ete cependant difficile de fournir la preuve, au moyen de quelque detail particulier, de l'impossibilite fla- grante d'un pareil dessein dans la nature" (pp. 36-37). It must be noted that this reading of objects as a comment on procedures in the book still assumes a "use" of objects to refer to some human meaning: exactly the symbolism and anthropomorphism which Robbe-Grillet strongly attacks in such essays as "Nature, Humanisme, Tragedie," in Pour un nouveau roman. Sometimes Robbe-Grillet uses nature to set a tone, knowing that the description is a lure to the reader. Indications like "Le soleil et la chaleur devenaient en outre excessifs" and "La mer monte toujours" (pp. 86, 87) parallel a growing agitation that may be imputed to Mathias, and in fact duplicate just that driving sun urging Camus's Meursault on to his murder in L'Etranger that Robbe-Grillet condemns as anthropomorphic. Such a description in the hands of Robbe-Grillet must, therefore, be seen as ironic. How- ever, if he wants descriptions to be without "arrieres-plans"-without ulterior motive, without symbolism-yet acknowledges this ideal by featuring in his books ports "sans arriere-pays, sans debouches" (p. 53) and bartenders without "arriere-pensee" (p. 244), there is an inherent paradox in excluding reference except to artistic procedures. The work stays within itself, but produces commentaries still at second remove, through the same blithe appropriation of objects. The figure eight in the book is, of course, one such object. Just because it is repeated, we insist it must serve some purpose. Repetitions may merely add up to abstract pattern, but we are more trained to see the insistence of symbol. Does the figure recall a voyeur's eyes, a rope looped around hands behind a back? Let the reader beware! But as a cipher for Robbe-Grillet's writing, a "huit couche" is one figure next to another that it repeats: descriptions meticulously retraced. Taken singly or together, the o's stretch from zero to infinity, leaving the odds for a crime or believable anecdote all or nothing at all. The movie poster that plants the idea of a crime changes to one involving a "double circuit," and, finally, to one that does not correspond to the movie of the week at all. The cafe owner then has to scrape the sign back to its white page base, and starts to trace an o: back to the nothing where we began-but ready for the addition of the second circle of infinite opening possibilities and virtual worlds again. The readiness with which we read elaborate crimes and motives into a simple verbal exercise is both scorned as too gullible a confusion of art and life-and 330</page><page sequence="9">A READING OF LE VOYEUR praised as a marvelous generation of meaning from subtly controlled wordplay. However, while it is clear that life must not impinge on art to dictate its standards in a narrowly censorial way, one wonders how much the whitewash of metaphor-our taming of Robbe-Grillet's vio- lence into a "literary comment"-might cover over life situations as well, to confuse not art as life, but life as art. 1 Roland Barthes, Essais critiques (Paris: Seuil, 1964). 2 Alain Robbe-Grillet, Pour un nouveau roman (Paris: Minuit, 1963), pp. 23-24. 3 Alain Robbe-Grillet, Le Voyeur (Paris: Minuit, 1955), p. 9.
