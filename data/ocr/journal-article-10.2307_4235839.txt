CONFERENCE REPORT The Alfred Empirical Biopolitics Conference: Prospects for a Cohesive Frame of Reference for Inquiry Fred Kort University of Connecticut, USA AS A RESULT OF the initiative, ingenuity, and dedicated efforts of Steven Peterson and James Schubert, and the generous support of Alfred University, the Conference on Empirical Biopolitics was held from July 18 to July 22, 1990, on the campus of Alfred University. Six empirical studies were presented and extensively discussed at this small and intimate con- ference, with two or more hours devoted to each. Discus- sion focused not only on the specific research questions under investigation, but also on the ramifications for inquiry in the entire field of biopolitics. Odelia Funke and Fred Kort were the designated discussants, but all presenters took part in the stimulating discussions of each paper. The emphasis on empirical studies at the Alfred con- ference can be readily understood on the basis of a few salient considerations. Efforts to achieve a new para- digm in a discipline will necessarily involve considerable thought and discussion about theoretical foundations. Ultimately, however, increasing attention must be given to empirical examinations of specific phenomena with which the discipline is concerned. As a new paradigm in political science, biopolitics?to be understood as the biobehavioral study of political processes and institu- tions?initially had to explore the design of the new endeavor, and it must continue to do so. Without dem- onstrating in specific instances, however, that the new paradigm provides insights that otherwise could not be obtained, general theoretical arguments in its favor are not convincing. Moreover, the initial design of the para- digm must be considered tentative and subject to con- tinuous revision on the basis of the examination of the specific phenomena to which it addresses itself. By their nature, empirical studies are limited in scope. The care that must be employed in obtaining data and Fred Kort is at 4 Eastwood Road, Storrs, CT 06268-2402, USA. making appropriate inferences constitutes a demanding task. In addition, empirical studies must have a spe- cialized focus in order to achieve proper controls. In view of these constraints, the results of a properly conducted empirical study are, at least initially, pertinent only to a specially selected aspect of an encompassing discipline. The question that then has to be raised is, how do the results of a set of empirical studies contribute to a co- hesive frame of reference for the discipline? Scientific progress is accomplished by expanding the scope of the principles in terms of which phenomena under study are explained. For example, free-falling bodies, the inclined plane, and the pendulum originally were explained in terms of three separate empirical laws (Bergman, 1944). Later, these three phenomena were regarded as special cases of a set of general laws?the laws of mechanics?and a scientific theory replaced em- pirical laws. In a similar way, Kepler's laws of planetary motion became a special case of Newton's law of gravi- tation, and Newton's law, in turn, became a special case of the second postulate of the general theory of relativity (Walker, 1955). Much time may elapse before it will be possible to relate the six empirical studies that were presented at the Alfred conference to an integrating theory. Considering that the unified field theory in physics still has not been attained, the need for much patience in progress in biopolitical research should not be disturbing. As a modest beginning, let us see if we can identify a relationship of the six studies that were presented at Alfred to a frame of reference that provides some cohesion. The initial task in this inquiry is to determine to what extent these studies can be characterized as research endeavors in biopolitics or, more specifically, to what extent they constitute a biobehavioral approach to the examination of political processes and institutions. On this basis, a distinction can be made between studies that Politics and the Life Sciences February 1992 103</page><page sequence="2">Empirical biopolitics point toward biological bases of behavior and studies that actually examine these bases. The Alfred studies on "The Political Behavior of the Able Elderly," "Male Predominance and Coalition Behavior," "Supreme Court Oral Argument," and "Political Tolerance and Threat" can be characterized as belonging to the former category. The studies on "The Impact of the Presidency on Reproductive Success" and "Hormones, Mood, and Competition in Men and Women" can be regarded as studies that represent the latter category. As we now give individual attention to each study, let us see to what extent each either points toward, or actually explores, the biological bases of the behavior to which it addresses itself. We may then be able to speculate on?if not demonstrate?dimensions toward a cohesive frame of reference for biopolitics that emerges from these studies. Pointing towards biological bases In their study "The Political Behavior of the Able El- derly: What Next?," Albert Somit and Steven Peterson examine the ramifications of the growing number of elderly citizens for the political process and for public policy. They suggest that senior citizens will not only become more politically active but will also be an im- portant political force in the future. This has policy implications, for legislation will have to take into ac- count that the elderly are a powerful constituency. They conclude that better-educated and healthier senior citizens tend to be more conservative and more pol- iticized, in the sense that they are more interested in, more informed about, and more active in politics. In terms of cultural tradition, a prominent role for the elderly has been justified on the grounds that the wisdom of advanced age, based on experience, can be transmitted to the young for the benefit of the survival prospects of society. This cultural tradition may be related to a no- table feature of Homo sapiens: a life span that extends considerably beyond the age at which reproduction ends. It is possible, of course, that longevity is a feature in human development that has no evolutionary signifi- cance. It is also possible, however, and perhaps more likely, that natural selection has favored longevity as an attribute conducive to better adaptation. A long life span may have been selected because of the advantages pro- duced by a capacity to learn from the transmitted experi- ences of the elderly. Thus, the study by Somit and Peterson points in the direction of highly important biobehavioral foundations. Another biological dimension was suggested by Vin- cent Falger in his Alfred study on "Women in Inter- national Politics: Male Predominance and Coalition Behavior in Biopolitical Perspective." Falger devotes considerable attention to the primate studies of Frans de Waal, notably Chimpanzee Politics (1982) and Peace- making Among Primates (1989). De Waal's observations have shown that adult male chimpanzees are flexible in their coalition behavior and not much influenced by social bonds, especially when the rank order is changing. By contrast, females (and also young males) show stable coalition patterns and are strongly influenced by social bonds. Falger relies on de Waal's description of males as "strategists" who use coalitions to attain the highest possible status and to preserve it. "Balanced reciprocity" is also attributed to them as an aspiration, and de Waal does not hesitate to characterize their behavior in terms of the anthropomorphic concept of "balance of power." No comparable exhibition of "power politics" has been found by de Waal (1984) among the females of free- living chimpanzees. On the basis of these findings by de Waal, Falger examined differences between human males and females by observing their behavior in a game called "Diplo- macy," which provides a simul?t ion of coalition behavior in international politics. As a result of his observations, Falger does not reach conclusions about differences of behavior between males and females that are as acutely distinctive as those reached by de Waal with respect to chimpanzees. He notes, however, that he observed "in- teresting differences" between female groups and mixed or all-male groups. These differences justify further and more systematic study. James Schubert presented an Alfred paper on "Studying Supreme Court Oral Argument." Political scientists have generally addressed themselves to fea- tures of the judicial process that can be called extrajudi- cial considerations. In this connection, they have been criticized by legal scholars for devoting attention to pe- ripheral, and thus inconsequential, matters, while ne- glecting aspects that are central to the judicial process. In the case of this study, however, a subject is examined that by tradition and current practice is as "intrajudicial" as any other established component of adjudication, namely, oral argument before a court. At the same time, the study has implications for an understanding of human behavior on the basis of biological foundations that reach far beyond the judicial process. In what way does the study provide this encompassing perspective? Neanderthal man and woman had a brain capacity of approximately 1400cc, the same capacity as members of the human species have today. In other words, human brain size has not changed significantly in about 100,000 years. On the basis of fossil evidence, however, it has been argued that the bone structure surrounding the larynx made Neanderthal incapable of the kind of speech employed by contemporary members of the human species (an argument that?as reported by Bower, 1989?has recently been challenged). According to one hypothesis (also much disputed and not proved), Nean- derthal, regarded by most biological anthropologists as part of the species Homo sapiens, became extinct when 104 Politics and the Life Sciences February 1992</page><page sequence="3">Empirical biopolitics pushed into hostile environments by the current sub- species Homo sapiens sapiens, which had the capacity of present-day speech not later that 30,000 years ago (see Stringer, 1990). Possibly, then, oral communication might have been a decisive factor in human survival, and it may still be so today. A statement by Justice Harlan (1955) to the effect that the impact of oral argument before the U.S. Supreme Court has been greatly under- estimated may thus provide insights not only with re- spect to an understanding of the judicial process in a very traditional sense, but also in a biobehavioral perspective with regard to human communication in all of its forms. It is in the context of this perspective that the study by Schubert can be pursued. [Editor's note: A later version of this study is published elsewhere in this issue.] The Alfred study presented by George Marcus and John Sullivan, "Political Tolerance and Threat: Affec- tive and Cognitive Influences," also pointed in the direc- tion of the biological bases of behavior. Marcus and Sullivan showed that perceptions of threat may be inter- preted either as affective reactions, in the sense that individuals may rely on their prior feelings and prejudices, or as cognitive reactions, in the sense that individuals assess threat in terms of anticipated conse- quences for their values. The authors suggest that cogni- tive processes actually may be crucial pathways and that affective reactions may serve as valence "tags" to mark preferences, likes, and dislikes. These are important behavioral inferences. The bio- logical bases to which they point are the neural struc- tures on which affective reactions and cognitive processes depend. Neurobiological research has pro- vided much information that is pertinent to the explo- ration of affective as well as cognitive behavior. Such research can provide further insights into the phenome- na of interest to Marcus and Sullivan. Particularly note- worthy in this respect is the work of MacLean (1983), whose concept of the triune mammalian brain distin- guishes between the reptilian part, the limbic system, and the neomammalian part. Since the limbic system derives information from emotional feelings that guide behav- ior, it provides an important biological basis for affective reactions. Correspondingly, since rational capacities are associated with the neomammalian brain, the latter provides the biological basis for cognitive processes. The pursuit of this perspective in further research on political tolerance and threat would be desirable in view of a major conclusion the authors reach, namely, that affective and cognitive processes are conjunctive, even though they maintain distinct orientations. Such a con- clusion points to the need not only for further explora- tion of the pertinent neurobiological connections, but also for acquiring further understanding of the evo- lutionary setting in which these connections developed. Marcus and Sullivan suggest an evolutionary dimension by stating that, to the extent that intolerance is a threat reaction, it can serve an adaptive function. Thus, their study, like other research ih biopolitics, should be seen in the context of an evolutionary-neurobiological frame of reference. Exploring biological bases Two of the Alfred studies may be interpreted as involving a direct exploration of the biological bases of behavior. Gary Johnson presented an Alfred paper on "The Ulti- mate Wages of Presidential Power: An Examination of the Impact of the Presidency on Reproductive Success." Reproductive success is a salient criterion in evolution- ary theory. Its pertinence to studies of political behavior is shown by Johnson when he states that, over evolution- ary time, the psychological mechanisms that encourage and facilitate competition for power must generally have enhanced reproductive success or natural selection would have tended to eliminate these mechanisms. To be sure, he recognizes that these mechanisms may be byproducts of other adaptations, the cost of which may have been outweighed by the benefits of these other adaptations, but the probability of such an occurrence is low. Although the study is concerned in particular with presidential power in the history of the United States, a more comprehensive perspective on the origin of politi- cal leadership provides the foundation for the study. The evolutionary dimension is reflected in Johnson's study as headdresses himself to the relationship between dominance and reproduction. He notes that Dewsbury (1982) reports that studies of ungulates and carnivores show a correlation between dominance rank and indices of reproduction. He also notes that results for rodents and primates have been mixed. What can be added to these observations is that research by Ginsburg (1991) has shown a delegation of reproductive privileges by the alpha male to the beta male among wolves. With respect to humans, Johnson refers to the study by Chagnon (1979), which shows a relationship between headman- ship and reproductive success among the Yanomam? Indians. The long-term purpose of Johnson's study is to determine whether presidential power in the United States has enhanced long-term reproductive success of presidents, has diminished it, or has had no effect. The data Johnson uses for his study involve a com- parison of reproductive success of all presidents of the United States and their opponents in the respective elections. Data are being collected across four gener- ations. The data collected thus far are intriguing, but no definite conclusions may yet be reached. The inquiry to which Johnson addresses himself, however, goes beyond directing attention to the biological bases of political behavior by attempting actually to examine a possible evolutionary foundation. Competition is relevant to political behavior, espe- Politics and the Life Sciences February 1992 105</page><page sequence="4">Empirical biopolitics daily as it is formalized in the electoral process. Brian Gladue's study on "Hormones, Mood and Competition in Men and Women" is therefore relevant to the biologi- cal foundations of politics, even though it does not ad- dress itself directly to political behavior. Like Johnson, Gladue goes beyond pointing to the biological bases of behavior by actually exploring them. Whereas Johnson addresses himself to the evolutionary dimension, Gladue examines a physiological component of behavior. Specifically, Gladue found that testosterone levels in men increase during nonphysical competition. More- over, winners have higher levels than losers and have a slower post-competition decline in their levels than losers. By contrast, no significant effect of winning or losing has been observed with respect to post-competi- tion cortisol levels, although transient elevations of these levels were noted in all groups. Gladue infers from these findings that hormonal changes after competition are not only manifestations of general autonomie nervous system arousals, but that they also are influenced by psychological factors, such as mood, that are associated with an immediate awareness of a change in status. Furthermore, he found that actual performance in the competitive situations he examined is not necessary for the changes in hormone levels, but that the perception or knowledge of being victorious itself appears to be sufficient for triggering differential hormone response patterns. The special significance of this work is that current physiological evidence can provide support?or refuta- tion?of inferences from evolutionary studies, which have the limitation of having to rely on fossil evidence. This thought is of particular interest for consideration of a general frame of reference for biopolitical inquiry. An implied frame of reference In view of the disparate subjects of the empirical studies presented at the Alfred conference, it cannot be expected that they would readily generate a cohesive frame of reference for inquiry. In each instance, however, the studies either directed attention to or were actually en- gaged in the exploration of the biological bases of politi- cal behavior. In spite of their diverse subjects, a frame of reference for inquiry emerges that is imperative for all research in biopolitics. This is an evolutionary-neurobi- ological frame of reference, components of which were reflected in all of the studies presented at Alfred. For a biobehavioral approach to political behavior? broadly conceived as including processes and institu- tions?such a frame of reference is indispensable. Evolutionary theory remains the pervasive organizing principle in all biological understanding, whether one is committed to Darwinian gradualism or is more readily persuaded by punctuated equilibria. In explaining be- havior?including political behavior?in terms of evo- lution, one must recognize that behavior is dependent on the nervous system, which, with all of its charac- teristics, is dependent on evolution. In other words, behavior is a function of the central nervous system, and the central nervous system is, in turn, a function of evolution. In proposing this function of a function, it is not suggested that the relationship between evolution and neurobiological processes is unidirectional. On the con- trary, one must recognize that behavior has an ultimate impact on evolution. It affects the evolutionary process by having a proximate impact on phenotypes (e.g., the choice of a spouse and the ensuing characteristics of children), which then affect the course of evolution. The main point that must be recognized is that there is an intimate relationship between evolution, neurobiologi- cal characteristics, and behavior, including political behavior. Much work must still be done before an evolutionary- neurobiological frame of reference will become com- monplace in the diverse areas of research addressed by the studies presented at the Alfred conference. Never- theless, movement in that direction has clearly been achieved. The studies presented at Alfred are part of that movement. References Bergman, G. (1944).
