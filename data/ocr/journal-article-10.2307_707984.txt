With an appendix 'General because First', a Presocratic motif in Aristotle's theo- logy. Pp. 148. Amsterdam: Hakkert, 196o0. Cloth, fl. 18. THE author of this study is Assistant Pro- fessor of Classics and Philosophy at the famous Massachusetts Institute of Tech- nology. He is concerned with the whole question of the origins of Aristotle's doctrine of the connate pneuma, and he reaches radical conclusions. His starting-point is the article by Jaeger, 'Das Pneuma im Lykeion' in Hermes, xlviii (1913) [now in Scripta Minora, i (Rome, g96o), 57-102]. Jaeger had argued that Aristotle is referring to a doctrine already well known, which went back to Philistion and the 'Sicilian School' of physicians, and perhaps beyond them to Empedocles. But he failed to find positive evidence in Empedocles. Although he drew attention to Empedocles' view of the unborn embryo as a ?c?ov Jrvovv and saw that this implied life without breathed air, he found no clear evidence of connate pneuma as a principle of life in such an embryo. He seems to have supposed that if there were such a pneuma present it would differ only func- tionally from breathed air, and so would con- sist of (ordinary) air present in the embryo before breathing began. Reiche's investiga- tion defends the importance of Empedocles and the Sicilian School suggested by Jaeger against the criticisms of later scholars, but it leads him to conclude that such a pneuma for Empedocles must have differed in sub- stance as well as function from the later breathed air-in other words connate pneuma for Empedocles was not air at all but something else. It must have been iden- tical with Empedocles' life-principle. What this principle might be for Em- pedocles was something that baffled Aristotle (De An. 4o8aI3), and he wondered whether Love might in fact have been the principle involved. Reiche identifies it with some con- fidence as a '4-elemental mixture analogous to one present in the Sphairos, which is both divine and conscious though in a non- anthropomorphic way'. In the human being this is the 'air-like Sphairomorphic mixture of the demon'. With this as a starting-point Reiche reconstructs the history of the doc- trine of connate pneuma through the Sicilian School to Plato's Timaeus and Laws, Eudoxus, and Aristotle's De Philosophia and finally the De Generatione Animalium. No detailed consideration of the arguments can be undertaken here. Many doubts arise, but there is a fundamental difficulty at the start of the reconstruction. Once connate pneuma has ceased to be air in substance as well as function it has for all practical pur- poses ceased to be pneuma at all. As Em- pedocles did not use the term connate pneuma as far as we know, what is the link with the later doctrine ? Apparently only the tenuous generality that behind the doctrine of connate pneuma there may well have lain the pre-Socratic conception of 'immanent teleology'. To this fundamental difficulty Reiche has added others gratuitously. Firstly, the presentation of the argument is defective. It is only towards the end of the study that what he is arguing for begins to become clear</page><page sequence="2">94 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW -a more orderly presentation would have helped the reader to arrive at a fairer appre- ciation of the main contentions. Secondly, many parts of the argument are disfigured by passages of pretentious jargon. I quote as an example: 'As for such arguments as reason from the internal logic of a given thinker's position, their presence must not be allowed to obscure the historicity of the fixed data which enter into the definition of a given intellectual position. For, given the nature of his subject-matter, the historian of philosophy qua historian, provided he saves the phenomena (and that includes the much- invoked 'archaic logic'), is surely not only en- titled but obliged to draw a curve through the fixed points in his coordinate-system' (p. Io). Recurring bouts of this sort of lan- guage tend to hinder rather than assist understanding of the detailed analyses of fragments and testimonia which are the actual basis of the present investigation, and which certainly deserve careful attention.
