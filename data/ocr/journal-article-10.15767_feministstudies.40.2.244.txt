And the answer is, we really don’t want to know. —Carol J. Adams, The Pornography of Meat 1 It’s a bizarre sight to enter a slaughterhouse where the head slaugh- terer is holding a gun, the prisoners have knives, and the guards of  the prisoners have guns. I feel unarmed, along with the animals. —Sue Coe, Dead Meat 2 in an ePisode of the 2007 showtime documentary television series  This American Life titled “Pandora’s Box,” public radio host Ira Glass  visits a hog farm in Iowa. The segment focuses on the technologies uti- lized by an independent farmer to keep up with industrialized slaughter- houses. In his narration, Glass contemplates the ironies of injecting pigs  with growth hormones that hasten the animals’ muscle development but  also make them less tolerant of cold weather and weaken their immune  systems. The pigs’ entire six-month life span is spent indoors in heated  pens, where they grow to an average of three hundred pounds before  slaughter. As the camera crew captures this portrait of contemporary  1. Carol J. Adams, The Pornography of Meat (New York: Continuum, 2003), 13. 2. Sue Coe, Dead Meat.

The scene transitions from a worker sliding halved pig carcasses  across a refrigerated room to a close up of a sow giving birth onto the  metal grated floor of her pen as Glass, in a voiceover, narrates: It was hard to tell. Did all of this just seem weird to us because we  weren’t used to it? Or was it the opposite? Because we weren’t used  to it, we were the only ones who could see how truly weird it was.  Whatever the case, eventually, everything started to seem unnatural.  At one point, we came across a sow delivering piglets, and this, out of  everything we’d seen was the straw that broke Eddie’s back.3 Eddie is followed by the cameraman out of the pig barn and is caught  doubling over. He explains, “I had vomit in my mask, trying to be cool,  and pigs were shooting out the pig’s ass and I threw up. Okay?” 4 The  remainder of the segment intersperses interviews with “pig improve- ment” animal genetics researchers at Iowa State University, shots of the  camera crew hanging out in rural Iowa and trying to win a Superman  doll from a crane arcade game, the hog farmer discussing teaching his  son to farm with a small group of pigs in an old-fashioned outdoor pen,  rural landscape scenery, and a shot of one of the crew “flying” the Super- man doll out of a car window. Although Glass’s voiced-over narrative  wraps up the segment ambivalently discussing the lone hog farmer, nos- talgia, and technology, the final shot is a slow motion one of the camera  crew inside the hog barn, and the final comment from Glass is that Eddie  hasn’t eaten meat since filming. The segment brings together questions  of nature and technology, animals and humans, birth and slaughter,  appetite and abjection. What the episode seems to leave unspoken, how- ever, is the gendered focus of its gaze. The program includes interviews with male researchers, lingering  shots of the male hog farmer and his son, and the white male film crew’s  investment in the Superman character. The episode even includes images  from catalogs of, as Glass describes, “ridiculously well-endowed boars  with names like Big Unit, Four-Wheeler, Hulk, and Total Package.” How- ever, the “unnatural” image that initiates Eddie’s abjection is that of a  3.

Eddie’s justification for his queasiness at the  image, “pigs were shooting out of the pig’s ass,” equates the birth of pig- lets with waste excretion. The sow’s pregnancy and delivery are situated  in the episode by Eddie’s description as equally as vile and unnatural as  the grotesque growth accelerants injected into the pigs’ necks. Eddie’s  repulsion is an unconsciously gendered abjection that doesn’t take into  account the farmer’s agency and power over the sow’s life. This biopolit- ical “super” power is mirrored in the geneticists’ research in creating the  “perfect pig,” which, according to the “Pork Quality Expert” also inter- viewed in the episode, is simply the pig that “gives us the perfect pork  chop.” Supremacy, on the human end of this equation, is rooted in bio- technological mastery, while at the pig end it is defined by consumability. Seriously considering how ways of looking and thinking about  animal bodies shape ways of looking and thinking about human bodies  is practiced by a number of critical fields, including animal studies, fem- inism, and ecocriticism. A major argument posed by many of these fields  is that systems of violence enacted upon animals are structured in ways  that relate to systems of violence enacted upon groups of humans, espe- cially minoritized groups such as women and people of color. Exploring  the structures through which bodies—animal as well as human, racial- ized as well as gendered—and bodily violence are rendered, normalized,  and critiqued in the work of Japanese Canadian documentary filmmaker  and novelist Ruth L. Ozeki is the subject of this essay. Ozeki’s novel My Year of Meats centers on biracial Japanese Amer- ican filmmaker Jane Takagi-Little as she begins work for a Japanese pro- duction company to create a documentary series to promote the con- sumption of US beef to Japanese viewers. Over the course of the novel,  Jane’s filmic aspirations shift from cultural guide of regional US food- ways to muckraking investigative documentarian uncovering the truths  about the nature of industrialized slaughterhouse practices. Jane’s docu- mentary subjects and filming locations structure the novel, as she trav- els across the United States to capture different hometown locals and  their recipes. The narrative juxtaposes Jane’s culinary and filmic adven- tures across the country with the effect her program has on a member  of her target audience, Akiko Ueno, the wife of the Japanese ad execu- tive Jane works for, as she tests the recipes featured in the individual epi- sodes. Throughout the text, Jane and Akiko are both subjected to the  virulent sexism of Akiko’s husband Joichi, as he attempts to dictate not  </page> <page sequence="4"> Laura Anh Williams 247 only Jane’s filmic production but also Akiko’s culinary production, as  well as discipline both women’s femininity. Ozeki’s novel uses motifs  of food production and consumption to explore the multiple sites of  power and resistance deployed by and against bodies marked by race, by  gender, and by proximity to other animal bodies. The novel depicts not  only intensive animal farming, but also corporate agribusiness and food  production as well as a documentary televisual production not unlike  This American Life. However, unlike This American Life, consciousness of  gendered and racialized embodiments saturates Ozeki’s text and serves  to denaturalize and critique these problematic industrial and corporate  practices. Through its scrutiny of normative practices—eating habits,  gender and sexual practices—and their consequences, I suggest that My  Year of Meats offers a queer ecofeminist critique to such corporate and  cultural practices. Because of the novel’s explicit connections between nonhuman  animals’ experiences and female-bodied human experiences within struc- tures of power, its ecofeminist critical perspective is readily distinguish- able. Greta Gaard elaborates on the heterogeneous and interdisciplinary  fields that contribute to ecofeminist criticism in terms of their mutual  focus on power exerted onto marginalized bodies: In their analyses of oppression, socialists, animal liberationists,  ecologists, and feminists each distinguish between privileged and  oppressed groups, where the privileged are upper- or middle-class,  human, technologically and industrially “developed,” male, and the  oppressed are poor or working-class, nonhuman animal, “undevel- oped” nature, and female, respectively. Ecofeminism describes the  framework that authorizes these forms of oppression as patriarchy,  an ideology whose fundamental self/other distinction is based on a  sense of self that is separate, atomistic.5 More specifically, my argument for the cultural critique My Year of Meats  performs is animated by queer theory’s interest in revealing and chal- lenging relations of power in normative cultural institutions. My explo- ration is mobilized by Judith Halberstam’s productive questioning of  5.

Ozeki’s text  stages a queer ecofeminist critique of hegemonic cultural practices and  modes of production and reproduction that prioritize capital over living  bodies, both human and animal. Working as a central narrative theme  in My Year of Meats, intensive agriculture—the modes of farming highly  dependent on chemical, genetic, and mechanical technologies in order  to produce the highest yields—shows food production and consump- tion as imbricated within structures of power, domination, and violence,  as well as racism and sexism. Beef, pork chops, fried chicken, and other  meats—the stereotypical staples of the North American diet—“serve  multiple functions,” as suggested by Emily Cheng. They are “a metaphor  for womanhood, the locus of anticapitalist politics, an object through  which the violence of capital upon the body is played out, and a subject  of public health and environmental concern.” 7 Ozeki’s novel disrupts the  bliss of the ignorance of harmful food practices and aligns such prac- tices with dehumanizing discourses of racism, sexism, and heteronor- mativity. I focus specifically on My Year of Meats because of its attention  to animal bodies and its representational and biopolitical renderings of  raced and gendered bodies. 6.

Like the gen- eral awareness of the gay closet as conceptualized by Sedgwick, every- one knows what takes place in an abattoir. Like the closet, the abattoir  is closed off from view and contains a potentially unsettling truth. But  whereas maintaining ignorance of the contents of the gay closet ensures  access to normative social privilege, defending against knowledge of the  specifics of the abattoir maintains the pleasure and desires of the subject.  The key to maintaining this pleasure is the defense of ignorance—as  Carol J. Adams suggests, “we really don’t want to know” what goes into  making meat. Cathryn Bailey describes this logic as “permit[ting] us to  maintain a wall of ‘willed ignorance,’ a willful refusal to know about  animal suffering.” 9 Throughout My Year of Meats, Jane increasingly captures these  unsavory truths about food production, even as she is assigned to con- struct a program promoting their consumption. She finds that her narra- tive desire to articulate the “truths” she uncovers directly conflicts with  her mission. Near the end of the novel, as Jane ponders how best to edit  the slaughterhouse footage she filmed into a cohesive narrative, she con- siders at length the accessibility of information about food production: Information about toxicity in food is widely available, but people  don’t want to hear it. Once in a while a story is spectacular enough  to break through and attract media attention, but the swell quickly  subsides into the general glut of bad news over which we, as citi- zens, have so little control. ...

I have heard myself  protesting, “I didn’t know!” but this is not true. Of course I knew  about toxicity in meat, the unwholesomeness of large-scale factory  farming, the deforestation of the rainforests to make grazing land for  hamburgers. Not a lot, perhaps, but I knew a little. I knew enough. ...  I would like to think of my “ignorance” less as a personal failing and  more as a massive cultural trend, an example of doubling, of psychic  numbing, that characterizes the end of the millennium. If we can’t  act on knowledge, then we can’t survive without ignorance.10 Access to information for Ozeki’s character produces not knowledge  and action but inaction and disempowerment. As she describes it, igno- rance becomes a survival strategy that allows the public to live with “bad  knowledge.” Doubling is her term for possessing contradictory impulses:  “I did care, and at the same time I couldn’t afford to care, and these two con- trary states lived side by side like twins, wrapped in a numbing cocoon  that enabled me to get the work done” (176). However, I suggest that the  doubling or turning back from a course of action that “bad knowledge”  produces implies a degree of agency that preserves not only the ignorant  self, but more specifically, privilege and pleasure. In the context of consumer knowledge and choice, an epistemology  of the abattoir suggests an economy of consumption and pleasure struc- tured not only by complicity but also with a deep investment in a spe- cific willed ignorance, an obliterating disbelief, a deliberate forgetting,  and a motivated abnegation of knowledge that privileges the ignorant.  Jonathan Safran Foer describes people’s reactions to simply learning the  topic for his 2009 book Eating Animals: Almost always, when I told someone I was writing a book about  “eating animals,” they assumed, even without knowing anything about  my views, that it was a case for vegetarianism. It’s a telling assump- tion, one that implies not only that a thorough inquiry into animal  agriculture would lead one away from eating meat, but that most  people already know that to be the case.11 10.

This sentiment is reproduced in more detail  in Michael Pollan’s The Omnivore’s Dilemma: A Natural History of Four  Meals. In the introduction to his study, Pollan links pleasure, eating, and  knowledge. Eating the products of industrialized food manufacturing  (for example, the McDonald’s Chicken McNugget), he argues, is eating  in ignorance, which has but “fleeting” pleasures. He writes, “Many people  today seem perfectly content eating at the end of an industrial food  chain, without a thought in the world: this book is probably not for them;  there are things in it that will ruin their appetite. But in the end this  is a book about the pleasures of eating, the kind of pleasures that are  only deepened by knowing.” 12 However, after detailing the realities of  industrial concentrated animal feeding operations practices at length— manure lagoons, antibiotics used to treat animals sickened by their feed,  drug-resilient microbes entering the human diet—Pollan backs away  from this new knowledge, the knowledge that he knew would ruin his  appetite, to defend his own desire and pleasure. After describing the  events that will take place in the final months of a steer in a concen- trated animal feeding operation in Kansas, Pollan reflects on the com- plicity of his appetite: Standing there in the pen alongside my steer, I couldn’t imagine ever  wanting to eat the flesh of one of these protein machines. Hungry  was the last thing I felt. Yet I’m sure that after enough time goes by,  and the stink of this place is gone from my nostrils, I will eat feedlot  beef again. Eating industrial meat takes an almost heroic act of not  knowing, or, now, forgetting.13 Elevating the ignorance produced by his willful forgetting to the degree  of heroism because of the degree of effort it requires, Pollan uncritically  and unequivocally establishes that the pleasure of satiating his appetite  will be privileged over his knowledge of the awful realities of the feedlot  he has just witnessed. His impetus for action is pleasure, not knowledge.  12. Michael Pollan, The Omnivore’s Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals  (New York: Penguin Books, 2006), 11. 13. Ibid., 84 </page> <page sequence="9"> 252 Laura Anh Williams In the end, Pollan’s own position asserts a kind of pleasure only deep- ened by not knowing. The epistemology of the abattoir may also be seen at work on a  broader cultural level than individual eating practices. In Animal Cap- ital, Nicole Shukin makes a provocative link between technologies of  mass production and consumption, visual reproduction, and industrial- ized slaughter. Tracing the inspiration of Henry Ford’s assembly line to  his visit to a vertical abattoir “disassembly line,” Shukin notes a signif- icant cultural disavowal of this inspiration: “The auto assembly line, so  often taken as paradigmatic of capitalist modernity, is thus mimetically  premised on the ulterior logistics of animal disassembly that it techno- logically replicates and advantageously forgets in a telling moment of  historical amnesia.” 14 Furthermore, she traces the birth of motion pic- tures and mass-produced still photography, with their reliance on gela- tin (protein extracted from bones, skins, and connective tissues of ani- mals) in emulsion plates, papers, and film stocks, to industrial animal  slaughter. She writes, “for cinema’s animated effects to literally develop— they required the tangible supports of photographic and film stocks.  It is here, in the material convolutions of film stock, that a transfer of  life from animal body to technological media passes virtually without  notice.” 15 Noting the centrality of animal locomotion in the photogra- phy of Eadweard Muybridge as an immediate predecessor to moving pic- tures, Shukin notes the irony of the animal substance rendered trans- parent in order to offer visual representation of live animal motion. The  avoidance she describes as “the image industry’s repressed contingency  on animal rendering” offers yet another occasion to examine the erasure  of animal bodies in the popularization and mass consumption of photo- graphic representation itself.16 Historians of the modernization of slaughterhouses note the physi- cal and discursive shift from stockyards to slaughterhouses. Paula Young  Lee notes that philosopher Jeremy Bentham included chicken farms as  an institution that fit into his conception of the Panopticon. Lee writes,  “From a normative centralized point of authority, the Panopticon’s view  14.

It  must be as if it were not.” 19 Vialles further explores the erasure of kill- ing in slaughterhouses by examining shifting encyclopedia entries for  “abattoir” over time. The entries that had once included representational  drawings or photographs of abattoir killing floors transformed into geo- metric flow charts. This dramatic shift in visual representation, Vialles  argues, demonstrates “how the term has gradually had to be emptied  of all precise concrete representation in order to keep it ‘presentable.’” 20  Constructing the history of mass assembly, film production, or even  meat production in a way that occludes images of violence, of killing,  or even of animals is the most direct product of an epistemology of the  abattoir. Adams calls the object of this avoidance or negation the “absent  referent,” or that which must not be in order to have pleasure. She writes,  “We do not want to experience uncomfortable feelings about violence,  butchering, suffering, and fear. This is the function of the absent refer- ent—to keep our ‘meat’ separate from any idea that she or he was once  an animal who was butchered, to keep something (like hamburger) from  being seen as having been someone (a cow, a lamb, a once-alive being, a  subject).” 21 She argues that a resistant attitude toward meat eating com- promises the meat eater’s pleasure and threatens the epistemology of the  abattoir: “At a dinner where meat is eaten, the vegetarian must lose con- trol of the conversation. The function of the absent referent must be kept  17. Paula Young Lee, Meat, Modernity, and the Rise of the Slaughterhouse (Leba- non: University of New Hampshire Press, 2008), 238. 18. Ibid. 19.

This complicity is the most desired product of this epistemology  with its willed ignorance of sordid details and the awareness that “bad  knowledge” would spoil enjoyment. Vialles calls this distancing and  abstracting of animal from its flesh a “spiral of avoidance”: All these disjunctions invite and combine with one another to keep  the mass killing of animals at a reasonable distance. ... It is very much  as if the initial separation between killing and meat had triggered a  process of repeated fissions forming a kind of spiral of avoidance of  a reality and a meaning that are too raw, the centre of the spiral and  the force behind it being the very thing that it is trying to avoid—for- ever unsuccessfully, and for good reason.23 The distance from mass killing required to maintain enjoyment, Vialles  suggests, is never fully achieved. The fact of violence here is avoided, but  not erased. In her model, the consumer cannot get too far away from  the central truth of this spiral, and the fact of mass killing remains  at its center. In his study Meat: A Natural Symbol, Nick Fiddes writes,  “The likeliest potential foods to nauseate us today are those recogniz- ably animal—the gristle, the blood vessels, the organs, the eyes—unlike  vegetable foods whose identity we rarely dread.” 24 The practice of meat  eating, if it is to occur, must often be obscured by forgetting that what  was being eaten was ever a living creature at all. The consolidation of  power is not the organizing principle for this epistemology, but rather  the maintenance of pleasure from a position of privilege that denies and  negates any harmful consequences or ramifications. “she is the meat made manifest”: rendering Women I introduce the idea of an epistemology of the abattoir in order to extend  it beyond the question of meat eating to additional forms of pleasure  enjoyed at the cost of “absenting” other subjectivities, most notably  22.

Ozeki’s novel offers characters caught  within intersecting modes of enjoyment at the expense of the other.  Because the documentary series at the center of the narrative aims to  depict American wives for a Japanese audience, images of women con- stitute a major source of pleasure, both visual and sexual. From its outset,  the criteria established for most desired telegenic subjects could also  describe pornographic imagery, with their common primary functions  to arouse appetites. After accepting the job offer, Jane writes the pitch  for the program My American Wife!: Meat is the Message. Each weekly half-hour episode of My American  Wife! must culminate in the celebration of a featured meat, climax- ing in its glorious consumption. It’s the meat (not the Mrs.) who’s  the star of our show! Of course, the “Wife of the Week” is impor- tant too. She must be attractive, appetizing, and all-American. She is  the Meat Made Manifest: ample, robust, yet never tough or hard to  digest. Through her, Japanese housewives will feel the hearty sense  of warmth, of comfort, of hearth and home—the traditional family  values symbolized by red meat in rural America. (8) According to the pitch, the aim of My American Wife! is explicitly gas- tropornographic; the program’s celebration of meat, “climaxing” in its  consumption, suggests both the gastronomic and sexualized consump- tion of the attractive wife. Woman is rendered as meat, and vice versa.  Although Japanese housewives are figured as the target audience, the male  producers delineate what physical qualities Jane should seek in her sub- jects. A similar rhetoric of human bodies, meat, and sexual climax is  deployed when Jane leaves her camera crew to entertain themselves in  a hotel room with pornography, “a small but well-curated collection of  prerecorded tape stock with titles like ‘Texas T-Bone Does the Hoosier  Hooters.’ These were little-known regional delights that the crew had  acquired during our travels, and needless to say, the climax was always  about meat” (53). This example offers not only women’s bodies in the  realm of gastropornography (in terms of word economy, “Hooters” col- lapses a restaurant chain, women’s breasts, and the waitresses who are  employed by the restaurant chain into one word), but also renders the  male sex organ as “meat.” In fact, most of Jane’s Japanese production crew  is introduced with a reference to pornography. The cameraman, Suzuki,  has a “passion for Jack Daniel’s, Wal-Mart, and American hard-core  </page> <page sequence="13"> 256 Laura Anh Williams pornography” (33). The soundman, Oh, is described as being an animal  lover who, along with Suzuki, gets drunk and “tape[s] pictures of blondes  from Hustler all over the Sheetrock walls of motels across America, then  use[s] the girls for target practice, shooting out their tits and crotches  with air guns they’d bought at Wal-Mart” (34). The novel’s antagonist,  BEEF-EX advertising representative Joichi “John” Ueno, is rendered  pathetic in his weakness for “big-breasted American women” and again  in a scene in a strip club where he is brought to tears during a lap dance  when a dancer, “straddled his tenderloin and offered up her round rump  for his inspection” (43). The use of butcher terminology to describe sex- ualized human body parts in this scene equates gastronomic pleasure  with both sexual pleasure and pornographic visual pleasure. Although  it is used here to ridicule Ueno, it captures the character’s deep invest- ment both in the sexual objectification of women’s bodies as well as his  valorization of meat as an expression of Western heterosexual masculin- ity. Late in the novel the boss of a slaughterhouse has an office described  as “a wood-paneled panopticon decorated with a large poster of a young  blond Amazon in jungle bikini, who overlooked the meat-cutting opera- tions below” (280). His cavalier attitude toward the consumption of por- nography helps articulate his relationship to the killing floor he oversees. For Ozeki’s other male characters, this excessive valorization of  meat and the sexual objectification of women’s bodies diminish as they  are increasingly exposed to the subjects of their series. Jane’s subjects  resist and at times ultimately reject the US cultural script of Walmart’s  abundance, meat’s healthfulness, and even heterosexuality’s centrality.  Each of Jane’s documentary subjects dismantles Ueno’s and the Tokyo  office’s imperatives for appropriate housewives, which center on attrac- tiveness, wholesomeness, and avoidance of “physical imperfections,”  “obesity,” “squalor,” and “second class peoples” (12). In her examination  of the novel, Monica Chiu argues that Ozeki’s text attempts to replace  Ueno’s “whitewashed views of America” with “Jane’s presentations of  happy multiculturalism.” 25 Although Jane’s interviewed families follow  an increasingly subversive trajectory—from the Martinez’s, a Mexi- can immigrant family, to the Beaudroux’s who adopt ten multiracial  25. Monica Chiu, Filthy Fictions: Asian American Literature by Women (Walnut  Creek, CA: AltaMira, 2004), 144. </page> <page sequence="14"> Laura Anh Williams 257 children, to interracial lesbian couple Lara and Dyann and their biologi- cal daughters—these families unsettle more than Ueno’s idea of “typical  American” white heteronormativity. The Martinez family’s story hints at  the exploitative labor relations between the United States and Mexico,  while the Beaudroux family’s adopted abandoned Amerasian and South  American children complicate how both family and nation are con- structed. The biracial lesbian wives Lara and Dyann resist not only heter- onormativity but also articulate their politicized refusal to eat meat: “It’s  unhealthy. Not to mention corrupt, inhumane, and out of control” (177). In Indiana, Jane and her production crew interview and film the  Bukowskys whose family tragedy helps restructure their entire small  town around compassion rather than commerce. Unlike most of Jane’s  other subversive subject choices, the Bukowskys are a white family, but  their radiant, blonde, sixteen-year-old daughter Christina is paralyzed  as the result of having been crushed by a delivery truck in a Walmart  parking lot. The visual narrative Jane constructs is ostensibly to promote  Mrs. Bukowsky’s “Hallelujah Lamb Chops,” Christina’s first request  emerging from a vegetative state, but the crew’s interaction with the girl  functions to humanize white women, those who have effectively been  dehumanized through sexual objectification. In filming Christina over  several days, Suzuki and Oh establish an interactive, playful relation- ship with her. Afterward, when viewing the footage from their inter- views, Jane’s production assistant, an ex-flight attendant, attempts to  relate to the men on the assumed premise of their mutual pleasure in  sexually objectifying women: “‘Too bad about those legs, huh?’ said the  flight attendant. ‘She’s great from the waist up, though. I wonder, do  you think she still can, you know... ’ He pantomimed the old in-and-out  with his fist and forearm, and looked to the boys for confirmation” (138).  Suzuki’s violent disgust with the production assistant’s pornographic  male gaze—he responds by slapping the flight attendant across the face  twice—signals a shift in the production crew’s position. Blonde Ameri- can girls no longer constitute a category of sexually objectified pleasure  for Oh and Suzuki. Knowledge—in this instance, their firsthand inter- actions with Christina—disrupts sexually objectifying pleasure and  motivates a change in the two men: Jane notes, “I noticed that [Suzuki]  and Oh stopped shooting out the crotches of blonde girls in their motel  room. Our visit to Hope had changed them” (139). This reversal of atti- tude stands out in a novel filled with so many instances of the opposite  </page> <page sequence="15"> 258 Laura Anh Williams attitude: objectification and dehumanization. Suzuki’s and Oh’s pres- ence and support of Jane’s documentary impulses throughout the  remainder of the novel is suggestive of the transformational power of a  gaze that resists the logic of the objectification of bodies for consump- tion and pleasure. Women in the text are dehumanized not only in terms of sexualized  imagery, but also through the alignment of their bodies with the bodies  of livestock animals by medico-scientific discourses. As Jane’s documen- tary aspirations diverge more and more radically from her assigned job,  she begins contemplating her own misshapen uterus in conjunction with  her mother having been prescribed the synthetic hormone estrogen  diethylstilbestrol (DES) during her pregnancy. Shameem Black writes  that “as Jane moves backward on the food chain from devouring beef  to exploring its modes of production, she discovers that the same dan- gerous hormones are used to regulate the biological rhythms of both  animals and women.” 26 DES becomes a major narrative thread in the  text when Jane chronicles its history from its use as an artificial growth  stimulant in chickens, then livestock, and simultaneously as a hormone  therapy in pregnant women. A manmade estrogen, DES is loaded with  disturbing implications regarding gender as well as human and animal  bodies. The chronology of restrictions against the use of DES makes  these implications more apparent. Julie Sze notes, “DES was banned in  chickens in 1958, while its use in cattle continued until 1979, and its use  in women continued through the 1980s.” 27 With the increasing focus  on DES, Ozeki’s novel locates medico-scientific discourses regulating  women’s bodies on a continuum close to those regulating the bodies of  livestock. When Jane reflects on her mother’s pregnancy, she contem- plates the intersecting discourses regarding racialized bodies that fur- ther objectified and endangered her mother’s reproductive health: Of course old Doc Ingvortsen, the family doctor in Quam, decided  she was delicate. And from there, it would have been only a rea- sonable precaution. After all, he was used to treating large-bodied  26. Shameem Black, “Fertile Cosmofeminism: Ruth L.

But  Ma was Japanese. My birth certificate, signed by this doctor, lists  her race as “yellow.” And she was narrow. Doc must have ... seen the  ads. So he gave her a prescription, probably about 125 milligrams of  diethylstilbestrol ... To keep me in place, floating between her deli- cate hips. (156) Ozeki’s repetition of “delicate” to describe Jane’s mother’s Japanese body  calls attention to discourses of racialized gender stereotypes in circula- tion. Doc Ingvortsen’s classifying of her mother as “yellow” demonstrates  the objectification of her body as a result of these racial stereotypes that  embed her more deeply within the biopolitical “care” of the doctor. Sze  argues, DES “highlights how categories of race, gender, human/animal,  and nature are unstable, shaped and contested by ideas and cultures,  and through corporate industries which actively shape these catego- ries through their products and processes.” 28 Coupled with stereotypes  associating Asian women’s bodies with diminutive frailty, DES is admin- istered for Jane’s mother’s own good and for the good of the fetus she  carries. Figured as a wonder drug that would “render normal gesta- tion ‘more normal,’ DES was considered benign because it was making  a ‘natural,’ ‘biological,’ and ‘normal’ process more effective.” 29 Writing  about researching DES for the novel, Ozeki makes explicit the blurred  boundary between women and livestock: “Suddenly the metaphor was  no longer simply a literary conceit. It was frighteningly real: women  weren’t just like cows; women and cattle were being given the identical  drug, with equal disregard for safety.” 30 Through biotechnology and bio- power, animal bodies (cows, pigs, chickens) are no longer incommen- surable with human bodies, even—as the narrative progresses—white  male bodies. The control over life through diet, biotechnology, synthetic growth  hormones, and fertility treatments emerges as a major narrative concern  in My Year of Meats.

Jane takes note when an African American interview  subject, Mr. Purcell, discusses the effects of eating inexpensive chicken  parts—“It was some medicines they was usin’ in the chickens that got  into the necks that we was eatin’.... An’ that medicine, well, if it didn’t  start to make me sound just like a woman!”—immediately before explor- ing her own familial history of DES (117). Jane is a “DES daughter,” suffer- ing from a deformed uterus and infertility as the result of her moth- er’s prescribed dose during pregnancy. Feedlot owner Gale Dunn’s white  body is also contaminated with the illicit DES cocktail he injects into his  cattle, as each time he becomes angered, his voice spirals up an octave.  In addition, his five-year-old half sister Rose suffers from premature the- larche—grossly premature breast development, pubic hair, and men- struation—as a result of estrogen poisoning. Although Mr. Purcell’s and  Gale Dunn’s bodies are subject to the effects of the synthetic estrogen,  the female bodies in the text are the most heavily marked, acted upon,  and the most closely aligned with animal bodies. Human reproductive  health is placed on a continuum with livestock production, and as the  text and Jane’s documentary filmmaking nears its climactic revelation of  a slaughterhouse killing floor, the biopolitical forces governing animals’  lives and women’s bodies begin to look more and more alike. The conflation of production and reproduction also saturates the text.  Beyond her connection to her own mother’s reproductive health, Jane  is also inextricably linked to Ueno’s wife, Akiko, who stands in as the  target audience of Jane’s program. Anorectic, nauseated by meat dishes,  and unable to menstruate because of her low body weight, Akiko is forced  by Ueno to watch My American Wife!, replicate its recipes, and rate the  program for standards such as “Authenticity,” “Wholesomeness,” “Deli- ciousness of Meats” (128). He attempts to discipline her body into a sub- ordinated domesticity authenticated by the series he produces. Ueno’s  escalating mistreatment of his wife, his desire to control her appetites  both culinary and sexual, his physical violence and eventual rape of  Akiko are all guided by the rigid adherence to cultural gender stereo- types, both Japanese and US American, that define his ideology. Ueno is  largely responsible for constructing and policing “Wholesomeness” and  “Authenticity” for the program. That he asks to be called “John” (Ueno is  pronounced “Wayne-o”) reflects the degree to which his idea of iden- tity is influenced by a white US American cowboy fantasy of mascu- linity. Ideologically and literally invested in marketing the “authentic”  </page> <page sequence="18"> Laura Anh Williams 261 supremacy of US red meat, he most directly associates the consumption  of red meat with sexual dominance and heteropatriarchy. He uses the  authority of his meat expertise to coerce his wife into “fattening up” and  putting “some meat on her bones” so that she might bear a son. Akiko,  however, reads against the grain of her husband’s My American Wife!,  seeing the Beaudroux family’s ten adopted multiracial children and the  lesbian couple as productive sites of resistance to the patriarchal ideol- ogy Ueno attempts to enforce. “it’s man versus life”: rendering race As a whole, the novel stages an opposition to the oppressive and restric- tive ideologies that Ueno embodies. The critique extends beyond sexist  objectification of women or even heteronormativity. When Jane discusses  her growing racial consciousness as a girl in Quam, Minnesota, she links  the forces at work in sexism with something larger. Reexamining Frye’s  1902 Grammar School Geography, a book she had once used to learn about  the “Races of Men,” Jane comments on the heavy Enlightenment human- ism the book is grounded in: It isn’t Mr. Frye’s use of the generic “man” for “human” that I’m inter- ested in. Other women might object to his choice of words, but as  far as I’m concerned, that’s an intraspecific quibble. The conflict  that interests me isn’t man versus woman; it’s man versus life. Man’s  REASON, his industries and commerce, versus the entire natural  world. This, to me, is the dirty secret hidden between the fraying  covers. (154) While Jane chooses not to “quibble” with Frye’s use of the universal “man”  here, the novel presents much to align women’s bodies with animal  bodies and to position those bodies in opposition to “man’s REASON.”  This functions to overtly connect the dehumanizing effects of global  capitalism (“industries and commerce”) on the natural world, on human  and animal bodies with the dehumanizing effects of racism. Because of the centrality of biotechnologies and representational  technologies, the processes at work in rendering—that is reproducing for  the text—racialized, gendered, and sexualized bodies becomes linked to  the industrial processes involved in rendering animal bodies. As Shukin  defines it: </page> <page sequence="19"> 262 Laura Anh Williams Rendering signifies both the mimetic act of making a copy, that is,  reproducing or interpreting an object in linguistic, painterly, musi- cal, filmic, or other media (new technologies of 3-D digital anima- tion are, for instance, called “renderers”) and the industrial boiling  down and recycling of animal remains. The double sense of render- ing—the seemingly incommensurable (yet arguably supplementary)  practices that the word evokes—provides a peculiarly apt rubric for  beginning to more concretely historicize animal capital’s modes of  production.31 As it does in industrial meat processing then, rendering in Ozeki’s text  works as a means by which gender, racial, and national identity are pro- duced or made visible, even as they are qualities produced by the boil- ing down and recycling of cultural stereotypes and practices. My Year  of Meats’ documentarian protagonist and heterogeneous narrative style,  which incorporates everything from excerpts of the eleventh-century  text The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon, to corporate memos, faxes, and  camera directions in addition to traditional narrative, provides layer  upon layer of representational rendering. The text is also highly con- scious of technologies of visual representation and of how narratives  prescribing gender and sexual expectations are boiled down and recy- cled by mass culture. The ways Ozeki’s text works at rendering gender  become related to the ways animals are rendered through industrial  food production. The novel critiques the ways women’s bodies are rendered, and  consequently dehumanized or objectified through cultural stereotypes,  pornography, and reproductive technologies, as well as the way human  bodies are rendered similar to animal bodies through their exposure  to DES. An additional identity category the text discusses in a dehu- manizing, even animalizing, context, is race. Juxtaposing the concept  of “dehumanization” in relation to shopping for meats and to racial vio- lence, Ozeki aligns the impulse to dehumanize with the epistemology of  the abattoir: disassociation from violence in order to maintain a sense of  well-being and ease. At one point in the text, Jane reports that accord- ing to a market survey conducted by a grocery chain, “The modern Japa- nese housewife finds the human interaction necessary to purchase meat  31. Shukin, Animal Capital, 20. </page> <page sequence="20"> Laura Anh Williams 263 distasteful” and that “the majority of housewives say they would prefer  to buy meat from vending machines” (87). The novel then offers a quota- tion from a Tokyo newspaper that reads, “The challenge for meat mar- keters is clearly how to ‘de-humanize’ meat” (88). Dehumanizing in this  context means the removal of a mediator or any human contact between  consumer and object. The narrative then shifts to Jane’s reflections on  the real-life 1992 shooting of a sixteen-year-old Japanese exchange stu- dent, Yoshihiro Hattori, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The man who shot  Hattori, Ozeki writes, “worked at a Winn Dixie supermarket as a meat  packer” and had yelled, “Freeze!” at the teenager who had rung his door- bell to ask for directions, before firing a .44 magnum into his chest (88).  The 1995 court proceedings detail the moments before Rodney Peairs  pulled the trigger: Prior to the shooting, Yoshi and Webb had announced their pres- ence by ringing the doorbell of the Peairs’ home. Testifying that he  believed Yoshi to be armed, Rodney Peairs conceded that he did not  see a gun, a knife, a stick, or a club—only an object which he later  ascertained to be a camera. In the well-lit carport, Rodney Peairs  stated that he observed an oriental person proceeding towards him  and that he appeared to be laughing.32 Ozeki’s inclusion of Hattori’s murder at this moment in the text suggests  it offers an example of the consequence of dehumanization and objec- tification as the result of racial difference. Ozeki’s emphasis on Peairs’s  occupation implies a causal argument between his supposed objecti- fying attitude toward the bodies of animals and bodies of color. Ozeki  reports that Peairs denied being a racist, but rather argued he “had acted  in a reasonable way to defend his home” (88). Ozeki goes on to discuss  this act of violence in relationship to American frontier culture: Hattori was killed because Peairs had a gun, and because Hat- tori looked different. Peairs had a gun because here in America we  fancy that ours is still a frontier culture, where our homes must be  defended by deadly force from people who look different. ... Guns,  32.

(89) In addition to the Wild West ideology that Ozeki highlights, the Hat- tori murder also reveals another instantiation of the epistemology of the  abattoir. In Peairs’s ardent claim of self-defense, he denies a racial bias.  This disavowal of racism allows Peairs to maintain the idea of his own  morally superior position in defending his property, according to Lou- isiana’s “kill the burglar” statute. bell hooks’s discussion of the Hattori  shooting, widely circulated after George Zimmerman’s 2013 acquittal  in the killing of Trayvon Martin, likewise links race and the defense of  property to masculinity and violence: “White supremacy has taught him  that all people of color are threats irrespective of their behavior. Capital- ism has taught him that, at all costs, his property can and must be pro- tected. Patriarchy has taught him that his masculinity has to be proved  by the willingness to conquer fear through aggression.” 33 Peairs’s unself- conscious use of “Oriental” to describe Hattori, however, compromises  this position, as does the trial testimony of his wife, Bonnie, whose ini- tial reaction to Hattori and his host brother at her front door was “get the  gun.” During the trial, when asked to describe Hattori, Bonnie stated, “I  guess he appeared Oriental. He could have been Mexican or whatever.” 34  The conflation of different ethnicities demonstrates an equal disdain, an  equal dismissal of the legitimacy of bodies of color. Although the Hattori shooting is not elaborated on beyond this link  to Manifest Destiny, the effects of racist violence haunt the text. Ozeki  offers another scenario at the Dunn and Sons feedlot, as Jane and her film  crew are about to film the facility. Making small talk as he injects Gale  Dunn’s “medicine” formula into the cattle, one ranch hand’s conversa- tion is riddled with racism, focusing on assumptions about Japanese diets:  “Yup, these cows here’s goin’ straight to Japan. ... I hear they even  eat the assholes and everything. Is that where y’all are from? ... Well,  that’s what Roy down at the packin’ plant told me.

You ask me, it’s a darn shame, wasting all that  good American meat on a bunch of gooks. No offense,” he added,  looking over at me. (266) The ranch hand’s comments articulate an explicit racism even as his  obligatory afterthought, “No offense,” attempts to disavow it. This moment  of articulated and disavowed racism offers another example of doubling,  of contradictory impulses simultaneously expressed, that serves to pro- duce the ranch hand’s superior subjectivity and to allow him to posit his  usage of “gook” as merely descriptive, not derogatory. His racism takes  the form of projecting undesirable culinary practices onto the imagined  foreign consumers for whom he is preparing the livestock. The declara- tion that Japanese consumers eat “assholes and everything” constructs a  fictive abject practice even more repulsive than the one the ranch hand  is actually engaged in, branding and injecting cattle with their illegal  “special formula.” While Ozeki does not overtly link these moments in  the text, there remains an implied critique of these impulses to defend  articulations of racism while simultaneously rejecting or disavowing the  harm inflicted on an Other. Both moments demonstrate a cognitive dis- avowal of racism that Ozeki juxtaposes with the processing of cattle and  the purchasing of meats. Racism, sexism, and animal slaughter, the text  posits, function on a structurally similar basis. visualizing the abattoir While the dehumanizing structures that Ozeki’s characters are up against  seem insurmountable when backed by the transnational capitalism that  BEEF-EX and the television industry represent, both Jane and Akiko resist  and unsettle these forces. Jane’s subversive casting choices in the epi- sodes of My American Wife! offer an alternative visual representation of  an idealized United States. Beyond this, however, these casting choices  also disrupt “spirals of avoidance” regarding a variety of other forms of  victimization produced by larger structures in US culture—from the  physical and economic harm created by Walmart in a small Indiana  community, to the literal loss of limb Mexican immigrant Bert Marti- nez suffers in order to achieve his American Dream, to the US military  occupation and sexual exploitation of women in Korea and Vietnam that  is only hinted at by the many Amerasian orphans adopted by the Beau- droux family. In addition, as Cheryl J. Fish argues, Ozeki’s text illumi- nates “a direct and insidious relationship between meat production and  </page> <page sequence="23"> 266 Laura Anh Williams environmental and public health issues, especially for women, children,  persons of color, and the poor.” 35 My Year of Meats moves ever closer to  the site and sight of Dunn and Sons’ killing floor, and as it does so, the  boundaries between nonhuman animal bodies and gendered human  bodies grow increasingly blurry. The centrality of televisual reproduction  to the novel allows Ozeki the opportunity to disrupt the deferred gaze. As a documentary filmmaker, Jane has a growing consciousness of  the constructedness of the moving image, of the ways mimetic effects  are produced through visual and aural technologies: I wanted to make programs with documentary integrity, and at first  I believed in a truth that existed—singular, empirical, absolute. But  slowly, as my skills improved and I learned about editing and camera  angles and the effect that music can have on meaning, I realized that  truth was like race and could be measured only in ever-diminishing  approximations. (176) Here truth and race are equally constructed concepts. As Jane attempts  to articulate the “truth” about meat through filmic representation, the  text refuses the singular teleology of the slaughterhouse. Exploring con- temporary abattoirs, Vialles articulates the difficulty of resisting this  singular teleology: “Seeing round an abattoir in the opposite direction  would be like watching a film backwards; it would mean reconstituting  the animal from the starting-point of the carcass, and that would be at  least equally disturbing, since it is precisely what the repeated disjunc- tions seek to make impossible.” 36 Because the exact moment of the ani- mal’s death is rendered as ambiguous as it is inevitable by the “process- ing” line, viewers have no choice but to submit to the slaughterhouse  trajectory. As Shukin describes it, viewers’ “submission ... to the irrevers- ible direction of the moving line is also the submission on which cinema  depends to achieve its mimetic effects.” 37 Both forms of viewership  demand a degree of passivity, of the suspension of disbelief, of the tacit  agreement that the path and the teleology of the moving image/animal is  35.

Ozeki’s protagonist, and her novel as a whole, works to disrupt  passive submission to this trajectory and logic of the slaughterhouse, a  rhetorical disruption of both temporal and spatial trajectory that are, as  Halberstam describes, “naturalized in relation to use values.” 38 As a text My Year of Meats complicates generic classification. Ozeki,  writing a novel that grapples with the notions of race and gender, also  risks nonfictional didactic elements such as the exposé on DES, the Hat- tori-Peairs shooting, characters quoting passages from nonfictional  sources, and even the inclusion of a bibliography with an author’s note  directing readers to sources that have informed her fictional book (363).  These details have prompted at least one scholar to classify My Year of  Meats a “docu-novel.” Examining the novel in conjunction with Ozeki’s  1995 film Halving the Bones, Michael Zyrd refers to it as “quasi-autobio- graphical” and notes the way the “novel is shot through with documen- tarian textures.” 39 As Jane prepares to edit the slaughterhouse footage  into her own narrative, the text engages most overtly with these docu- mentarian textures. The novel makes references to narration from film- maker Chris Marker’s 1982 Sans Soleil, a film that likewise resists clas- sification and linearity. “I remember that month of January in Tokyo,  or rather I remember the images that I filmed of the month of Janu- ary in Tokyo. They have substituted themselves for my memory. They  are my memory. I wonder how people remember things who don’t film,  don’t photograph, don’t tape. How has mankind managed to remember?”  (325). Filled with disjunctive images and narration contemplating visual  technology, war, Japan, human and animal bodies, mimesis, loss, time,  and film, Marker’s “cine-poem” offers another text that destabilizes the  passive consumption of moving images.40 Reiterating Marker’s collaps- ing of memory and visual reproduction, Jane plays her slaughterhouse  footage forward and backward, “replaying the images until they substi- tute themselves for memory, until nothing exists except what remains  on the screen” (326).

Simply viewing the footage upsets a passive position. Beyond  simply watching it, however, the sequence in which she views her foot- age offers a counterposition to the slaughterhouse trajectory, and it is  directed out at the reader: Then I tell you that suspended by her leg, the dead cow spins,  drained but still dripping from the mouthlike wound that bisects  her throat. Then, as though in response to some unearthly cue,  the wound gives a muscular throb, and a bright-red geyser springs  upward from the floor. The wound opens, wraps its lips around the  thick red stream, greedily sucks in the blood. When it’s finished and  the blood’s all gone, the mouth closes and the lips seal—satisfied,  seamless. The cow is thrashing, frightened, but whole again. Alive  and kicking.  I do it again. And again. Twisting the dial, shuttling the tape  backward and forward, running my finger across the cusp of life and  death, over and over, like there’s a trick here, something that if I prac- tice I might get good at. Sucking life back into a body. (325) Jane’s viewing practice refuses the time-motion ideology that dictates  the material disassembly of bodies even as it encapsulates those bodies  through technological rendering. Jane refuses to submit to the irreversible  line. She arrests it, rewinds it, plays it backwards. Although the medium  she employs ultimately dictates a more traditional chronological ren- dering of the killing floor, the representation of the slaughter functions  to complicate passive consumption. When police respond to a neigh- bor’s complaint about the noise coming from Jane’s video, the signifi- cance of her televisual rendering is articulated, “‘How can you watch  that stuff?’ the cop said, screwing up his baby face. ‘I don’t know.’ I shrug.  ‘How can you eat it?’ I rewound the tape, sucking the screams back into  the cow’s throat, along with the blood” (326). Jane’s footage, and by  extension, Ozeki’s text interrupts the mechanism of unknowing, forget- ting, avoiding. A line in Sans Soleil suggests that remembering or know- ing is a crucial aspect of forgetting: “I will have spent my life trying to  understand the function of remembering, which is not the opposite  </page> <page sequence="26"> Laura Anh Williams 269 of forgetting, but rather its lining.” 41 For Marker, as for Pollan, stand- ing in the pen of a feedlot steer while contemplating eating beef, the  lining of forgetting is knowledge and memory. Cutting across Vialles’s  “spiral of avoidance” and Marker’s “spiral of time,” the visual representa- tion constructed by Ozeki’s character rejects normative pleasure, tele- ology, chronology, even temporality. Jane’s film interrupts the ability to  fill memory in with forgetting. If the way meat becomes a consumable  object is through a denial—or, as Vialles writes, “it always comes down  to de-animalising animals in order to take possession of their flesh”— Ozeki’s text works to re-present, re-animalize, even re-humanize bodies  through rendering.42 Although the conclusion of the novel offers a sense of a happy  ending, the queerness of the narrative form resists such closure. Ozeki  discusses this end as a disruption of narrative: “I point an authorial finger  at the very thing I am writing, and poke a hole in the seamlessness of  the happy ending by making it self-referential and reflexive.” 43 This self- referentiality invites reading as active and reflective rather than as pas- sive consumption. The novel as a whole, with its fragments, lists, memos,  and faxes, resists linear narrative genre and plot trajectory. Catriona  Mortimer-Sandilands’s description for how queer theory intersects  with ecocriticism can be applied to Ozeki’s engagement with the vari- ous normalizing structures throughout the novel—heteronormativity,  sexism, Western/white supremacy, slaughterhouse teleology—and their  denaturalization: Part of an analysis focused on the contingency and articulation of  power relations, the ways in which natural and ecological relations  have been read and organized to normalize and naturalize power,  and likewise the ways in which cultural relations have incorporated  and shaped other-than-human actors and processes in the unfold- ing and re/production of power. To “queer nature,” in this view, is  to actively intervene in these ideas and practices of nature (ecolog- 41.

Discussing her inspiration to write My Year  of Meats, Ozeki makes connections between nonhuman animal bodies  and women’s bodies, between bodies consumed in both culinary and  sexual terms: I was thinking of women as cows; wives as chattel (a word related  to cattle); and the body as meat, fleshy, sexual, the irreducible ele- ment of human identity. I was thinking, too, of television as a meat  market, and Jane as a cultural pimp, pandering the physical image  of American housewives to satisfy the appetites of the Japanese TV  consumers.45 Ozeki’s protagonists, rendered queer by their raced bodies and resistant  desires, produce an alternative and resistant subjectivity. The text as  a whole challenges these notions of animalized women, unsettles het- eronormative articulations of family, and hegemonic masculinity and  denaturalizes the centrality and healthfulness of red meat in the US diet. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of interest in cultural  eating practices as well as popular texts dismantling the “All-American”  diet. Pollan has become a major figure associated with more conscien- tious eating practices. Beyond The Omnivore’s Dilemma, his texts include  The Botany of Desire: A Plant’s-Eye View of the World (2001), In Defense of  Food: An Eater’s Manifesto (2008), Food Rules: An Eater’s Manual (2009),  as well as countless food-related articles for the New York Times. He and  Eric Schlosser, author of Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-Amer- ican Meal (2001) narrated the 2008 Academy Award-nominated docu- mentary Food, Inc., which, like Ozeki’s novel, examines how corporate  farming practices in the United States produce harmful effects not only  in terms of human health, but also including ecological damage and  44.

While these texts offer important opposition to passive  consumption, they tend to do so from a normative subject position. In  The Botany of Desire, while imagining human interaction with plants in  terms of a reverse-anthropomorphism (humans functioning as bumble- bees), Pollan articulates his relationship with certain cultivars as a het- eronormative romance, “I can remember the exact moment that spud  seduced me, showing off its knobby charms in the pages of a seed cat- alog. I think it was the tasty-sounding ‘buttery yellow flesh’ that did it.” 46  His imposition of a heteronormative romantic desire on the plant’s part,  “Seeing these plants instead as willing partners in an intimate and recip- rocal relationship with us,” erases the problematic hierarchical nature  of heteronormativity as well as superimposing reciprocity and consent  onto a natural world that has been subject to exhaustive exploitation and  damage by the practices of corporate capitalism.47 In her critique of so- called food advice writing titled, “Can’t Stomach It: How Michael Pollan  et al. Made Me Want to Eat Cheetos,” Julie Guthman points out the way  this narrative genre objectifies deviant bodies while granting height- ened subjectivity to thin bodies. She draws a sharp focus on The Omni- vore’s Dilemma for Pollan’s “highly privileged and apolitical” stance. His answer, albeit oblique, is to eat like he does. The meal that he  helped forage and hunt and cooked all by himself, as he puts it, “gave  me the opportunity, so rare in modern life, to eat in full conscious- ness of everything involved in feeding myself: for once, I was able to  pay the full karmic price of a meal.” Notwithstanding Pollan’s argu- ably narrow understanding of a “full karmic price” (how, for exam- ple, does this rectify the exploitation of farm laborers?), my question  is: To what kind of politics does this lead? ... Indeed, no suggestion  is made that we ought to alter the structural features of the food  system, so that all might come to eat better.48 Although Pollan’s book’s focus critiques these corporate practices, it  is done from a position firmly rooted in normative ideology and does  46.

Ozeki’s fiction is invested  in a strategic use of food production and consumption motifs within  her narratives that blur divisions between privileged bodies and those  marked as consumable or disposable. Beyond calling for readers to eat  differently, her texts work to draw attention beyond the conventions of  fictional narrative in order to denaturalize, disrupt, and combat larger  and intersecting cultural and corporate practices that disempower, con- sume, and discard marginalized bodies. </page> </plain_text>
