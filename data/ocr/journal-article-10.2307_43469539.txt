<plain_text><page sequence="1">Spain's Political Theater FRANCIS DONAHUE even IN AN AGE of instant mass communications, theater remains among the most revolutionary of art forms. It brings together large audiences whose response to the playwright's immediate (not video- screened) message is as important as is the performers' interpretation of the message. Little wonder, then, that since the birth of modern drama with Henrik Ibsen's "problem play" The Pillars of Society (1877), some playwrights have seen their role as that of political activists helping to shape thinking in their societies. Modern political theater has two major branches: the propaganda theater and the traditional theater with a more subtle political thrust. The propaganda theater, with roots in Russia after the 1917 revolution, developed extensively in the United States during the 1930s. It drama- tizes a social or political problem, usually in broad strokes, and poses a specific solution, with the playwright striving to galvanize the audience into accepting and acting upon his solution (e.g., Clifford Odets's Wait- ing for Lefty , 1935). In the 1960s and 1970s propaganda theater in the United States metamorphosed into Street Theater and Guerrilla Theater (the "Living Theater" of Julian Beck and Judith Malina and the "Teatro Campesino" of Chicano Luis Valdez). The second branch - the tradi- tional theater with a more subtle political thrust - is headed by Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956), towering German dramatic theoretician and play- wright who, with his "alienation effect," strives to "distance" the spec- tator from the stage action in order to appeal to his intellect rather than to his emotions; the spectator is expected to learn from Brecht's plays, which serve as political parables, valid lessons concerning the inexorable march toward socialism. Still, the most sustained and extensive growth of political theater in our times has been in Spain. The theater there numbers an impressive array of playwrights who, working for the most part under the intimi- SOUTHWEST Review 105</page><page sequence="2">dating shadow of the censor during the Franco Era, attempt to examine and obliquely criticize the political realities of their society, as well as to engage in a continuing battle with the institutions, the morality, and the oppressive control of the Establishment. Although the death of Gen- eral Francisco Franco (1975) brought an end to censorship, Spain's political theater has continued apace, since a new set of political prob- lems has come to beset Spain: Basque separatism, political terrorism, a deteriorating economy triggering political unrest, and a fledgling parlia- mentary rule shaken by an abortive coup d'etat (February, 1981) led by Colonel Antonio Tejero and aimed at restoring a Franco-style regime. The attempted takeover has subjected Spain's democracy to a very severe test. The Spanish Congress, hoping to forestall another coup d'etat , has passed legislation empowering the government to shut down newspapers accused of favoring terrorism, and to seize printing presses as "instru- ments of crime" under certain conditions. Clearly, Spain is not out of the political woods and the need for political theater persists. Spain's political theater spans two periods: 1949-1975 (the Franco Era) and 1976 to date (the Transition Era). It has produced two major schools of playwrights: the Social Realists and the Avant-gardists. These two schools, while differing sharply in their dramatic techniques, share a common nemesis, the censor, and a common set of goals: to use theater as a political arm against the Franco Establishment, and (since 1976) to expose abuses of that Establishment in the "now-it-can-be-told" period, as well as to deal in dramatic terms with new problems such as terrorism and the threat of a return to a Franco-type regime. Of the host of themes essayed by Spain's political playwrights, two occupy center stage: repression and alienation. During the thirty-seven- year Franco era the overriding goal of the regime was "order"; the only alternative perceived by Francoists was "chaos." The regime imposed order from above through its own political arm ("the Movement"), the army, and its controlled labor syndicates. Repression was required regu- larly. And the reaction was alienation on the part of many sectors (stu- dents, workers, ethnic groups). The Spanish playwrights of both schools deal with that repression, showing how it causes deep and often tragic alienation. Because of censor- ship, they resort to a type of coded drama, rooted in symbols, subter- fuges, parables, allegories, and fables, all in an attempt to circumvent the 106 spring 1983</page><page sequence="3">censor, get their works produced, and thereby convey their political mes- sage to Spanish playgoers. Yet many of these plays are so enmeshed in their codes that only politically astute playgoers can read the code and decipher the criticism. As pioneers in the political theater, the Social Realists are traditional playwrights, turning out works with naturalistic settings framing the grubby existence of their lower-class characters. The latter, as protago- nists, struggle against something undefined and undetermined in the play. Under other political circumstances, that something would be the antago- nist, and it would be specific. Not so here, because the antagonist is the Establishment. To point out specifically the nature of that antagonist - the Franco state which controlled labor unions, the modified capitalist system which drives many Spaniards to leave their country for jobs abroad, the undertow of hatred and suspicion, an aftermath of the Span- ish Civil War - to pinpoint such an antagonist would mean that the play would be censored. Accordingly, that antagonist does not appear on stage, but it exists in the mind of the playgoer. And the cause of the repressive conditions remains unspecified but implied: the Spanish estab- lishment, from which the protagonists remain sullenly alienated. Social Realists have also resorted to the historical play as a pretext to deal with current problems. In setting the action in periods when Spain was under absolutist rule or was passing through a transition from such rule, the playwrights underscore the contemporary significance of selected past events. With the aid of Brechťs "alienation effect" - the emotional distancing of the audience - these plays become political par- ables for contemporary Spaniards. Although the historical play was utilized originally to get around the censor, it has continued to be culti- vated by playwrights in the post-Franco years. In the Transition Era the Social Realists have managed to premiere some works composed before 1975 but originally banned by the censor. These plays deal with such themes as political torture and political re- pression in a mythical country (read: Spain) or in an epoch of Spanish history (1823-1833) similar to that of the Franco era. They are also beginning to explore, in cautionary plays, the theme of a possible re- surgence of military dictatorship in Spain. Emerging in 1967 are the Avant-gardist playwrights who, in reacting against the Social Realists, adopt experimental European dramatic tech- niques, stemming mainly from the Theater of the Absurd and the Street SOUTHWEST Review 107</page><page sequence="4">Theater (the "Living Theater" performed in three Spanish cities in I967). Particularly do they heed the message of Antonin Artaud (1896- 1948), the seminal influence in all Absurdist drama, who calls for "total theater," casting aside narrative and psychological realism and relegating dialogue to an intermediate role while emphasizing gesture, movement, and ritual, as well as the creative use of lighting, costuming, music, mime, and multimedia effects. In contrast to the French absurdist theater, which is metaphysical, the Spanish Avant-gardists write a political theater, tending toward coded political farce, fable, parable, and allegory. Their characters are reduced to types: the student, the worker, the exploiter, the victim. Their symbolism is often very direct: a pig represents the tyrant; an octopus, the exploiter; a donkey, the civil guard. Still, the most frequent character is a dramatic surrogate for Franco: father, high priest, chieftain, marshal, mayor, or dictator. He is often accompanied by three advisers represent- ing the major supporters of the Franco regime: the army, business, and the church. Since the Avant-gardists were keenly aware of Franco's advanced age, they often have the Franco surrogate suffering from colitis, constipation, or physical degeneration. In the Transition Era the Avant-gardists turn out plays urging Spaniards to outgrow their psychological dependence on the father figure or to curb any longing for a replacement cast in the same mold. They also write works which point to the need to break down the sexual re- pression which afflicted many Spaniards as a result of the strict moral code imposed by Franco. That sexual repression is conceived as a dramatic surrogate for Franco's political repression. Hence, plays which show nudity, point toward sexual scenes, or deal with transvestism constitute a rejection of Francos strict code in the moral field and, by dramatic extension, in the political field as well. Left to playgoers is the task of decoding the political meanings of these absurdist or surreal-type plays, of reading between the lines, of converting the performers' gestures and movements into criticisms of contemporaneous Spanish political, social, or economic conditions. Most playgoers enjoy the bizarre actions, the bold staging effects, and the panache with which these works are performed, but relatively few fully comprehend the political raison d'etre of these Avant-gardist productions. Beyond the problem of artistic creation, the Social Realists and the 108 spring 1983</page><page sequence="5">Avant-gardists have had three major obstacles to contend with: the aforementioned censorship during the Franco era, the ingrained tastes of the Spanish playgoing public, and the box-office mentality of theater owners. For these playwrights the Franco censor represented repression at firsthand. Many of their plays were banned outright and remained un- produced during the Franco years. Some were approved for limited runs. Others were approved following deletions. Still others were allowed to be published but not performed. The conservative middle-class playgoers were often roiled by these antiestablishment plays and reacted by not queuing up the next time around. Instead, they patronized the "other Spanish theatre/' which fea- tures escapist fare such as comedies of manners, farces, and musicals, all without political bite. Spanish theater producers and owners have long held the view that plays are a business, not politics. They prefer works that promise long runs, and they are wary of those which may have political repercussions. As a result, the Social Realists have had a spotty record in getting their plays produced in the Spanish commercial theater. The Avant- gardists have seen their works performed mainly in the amateur off-off- off "independent theaters," casinos, clubs, cabarets, church halls, and town squares where the audience is made up of young people, workers, intellectuals, students, and housewives. Patriarch of the Social Realists is Antonio Buero Vallejo (1916- ) who, after initiating Spain's political theater with Historia de una escalera ( 1949 - Story of a Stairway ) , has produced a corpus of theatrical works which qualify him as Spain's most influential playwright today. Buero Vallejo, who served on the Loyalist (anti-Franco) side during the Civil War (1936-1939) and who later spent six years as a political prisoner, holds that every dramatic problem can be reduced to "the struggle of man, with his limitations, for liberty." Such a struggle is, clearly, against repression in the various orders of human existence. Story of a Stairway chronicles the lives of families living in a Madrid tenement at three separate periods: 1919, 1929, and 1949. Through the years family members have ascended and descended a stair- way which leads nowhere, a symbol of the lack of social mobility open to three generations of Spaniards. Remarks one character, "I'm afraid southwest Review 109</page><page sequence="6">of time . . . years pass . . . without anything changing . . . always seeking resources, putting up with humiliations, in order to be able to pay the rent, the electricity and our food ... it would be terrible to continue like this. . . With this melodramatic work Buero Vallejo spotlights the down side of Madrid life, striking a social nerve. En la Ardiente Oscuridad (1950 - In the Blazing Darkness) con- cerns Ignacio, a blind teen-ager committed to an institution where other teen-agers have made a happy adaptation to their limitations, terming themselves "sightless ones" (not "blind") and maneuvering without white canes. Ignacio, in refusing to conform, vows to expose the hypoc- risy which pervades the institution. Although he is ultimately killed, Ignacio has succeeded in spurring the other youths to revolt against their mindless conformity. In an introduction the playwright says, "It is not they [the blind], really whom I have attempted to portray, but all of us." Obliquely, he is posing the question to his fellow Spaniards: Should we accept our limitations and be happy in our conformity, or should we somehow rebel tragically against our fate? In Tragaluz (1967 - Skylight) the playwright achieves an emotional distancing of the audience in the Brechtean tradition by employing two narrators who present and comment on the action as if from a future century. That action concerns the progressive degeneration of a family whose members chose opposite sides after the Civil War; one collaborated and prospered, the other did not and stagnated. Shortly before the final curtain one narrator, addressing the audience, answers a question that has been insistently asked during the play ("Who is that?"): "That is you, and you, and you ... I am you, and you are I." The playwright is urging his audience of middle-class Spaniards to take moral inventory of their actions during the latter years of the Franco Era. In the Transition Era, Buero Vallejo has continued to turn out plays closely attuned to the national drama that Spaniards have lived out, and are continuing to live out. La Doble Historia del Doctor V almy ( 1976 - The Double Story of Dr. V almy), a play written in 1964 but banned in Spain until after Franco's passing, deals with police torture of political prisoners. The theme comes through clearly: torture for political reasons not only destroys the victim but also psychologically destroys the torturer himself. Distancing the work is a triple perspective: (1) that of Dr. Valmy, a psychiatrist who is dictating a case study; (2) that of the characters who act out sections of that case study; and (3) that of a 110 SPRING 1983</page><page sequence="7">smartly dressed upper-middle-class couple, representing the conservative sector of society, who comment on the action from a vantage point at the side of the stage, denying that such events have taken place while implying that political torture is an exaggeration or invention of wrong- minded people. The impact of this play is attested to by the number of anonymous death-threat letters which Buero Vallejo received after the premiere. In La Detonación (1977 - The Shot) the playwright offers a his- torical work rooted in the period of 1833-1837 when a tyrannical Spanish government fell and a liberal transitional period ensued. Coming under Buero Valle jo's dramatic scalpel are the problems of censorship, gov- ernment corruption, and political turncoats. Inescapable are parallels to the current Transition Era. In Jueces en la Noche (1979 - Judges in the Night ) the playwright takes up the problem of terrorism in Spain today, implying that pro- Franco elements have infiltrated the leftist terrorist movement. Their purpose is to orchestrate the assassination of military officers, hoping to inspire a military takeover of the government, which would return Spain to its pre-1975 status. (This work takes on renewed importance in the aftermath of the attempted coup d'etat of February, 1981.) Spain's second major Social Realist is Alfonso Sastre (1926- ), who produces political theater keyed to the social revolution as the author conceives it within a Marxist framework. In his works, which reflect a strong Brechtean impact, Sastre presents a brief for justifying the assassi- nation of a tyrannical ruler, and dramatizes the class struggle. He con- siders tragedy a type of criminal investigation of social crimes and col- lective suffering. Since he is more concerned with ideas than with people, he evinces less interest in his characters as human beings than as material- izations of ideological positions. Sastre's uncompromising posture led the Franco censor to ban all but five of his works, and those had short runs. His plays are not seen by the proletariat, which doesn't go to the theater, nor do they attract the middle class. But he is well known to intellectuals, critics, and stu- dents, who have followed his career characterized mainly by plays pub- lished but not produced. Muerte en el Barrio (1961 - Death in the Ghetto ) follows a police investigation of a lynching in the ghetto. That investigation reveals that a group of neighborhood people had killed a Dr. Sanjo because of his SOUTHWEST Review 111</page><page sequence="8">dereliction of duty: when a child was run down by a car and later rushed to the first-aid station, Dr. Sanjo, who was officially on duty there, was nowhere to be found. With this work, Sastre justifies vengeance taken by the proletariat in the face of mistreatment by a representative of the bourgeoisie, a theme which recalls to Spaniards a major Golden Age play (Lope de Vega's Fuente Ovejuna, 1612 - Sheep's Well ), which glorifies a popular uprising against an oppressive overlord. The Transition Era has seen one major Sastrean work performed by an "Independent Theater" group: La Sangre y la Ceniza (written 1965, staged 1977 - Blood and Ashes). This play is based on the life of Miguel Servet (1511-1553), Spanish theologian and scientist who was con- demned by the Catholic Inquisition and the Swiss Calvinists, and who was ultimately burned at the stake in Geneva by order of John Calvin. Blood and Ashes reflects the Brechtean mode not only in staging but also in theme, which parallels that of Brechťs Galileo Galilei (1943). In his work, Sastre chronicles society's ruthless proscription of a man who harbors "unpopular" ideas, a proscription with which Sastre himself was intimately acquainted during the Franco era. Antonio Gala ( 1936- ) occupies a special position in the ranks of the Social Realists, for he is a social critic who infuses his realistic work with a poetic dimension. Among his themes are a sense of aliena- tion and frustration and the need for full redemption for the "losers" in the Spanish Civil War. Gala's works are marked by verbal felicity, humor, and an arresting use of imagery. Los Verdes Campos del Eden (1963 - The Green Fields of Eden ) evokes poetically the lives of seven gentle outcasts from the national society. Their alienation leads one of them, an amiable vagabond, to set up his own refuge in a mausoleum. Joining him are a friendly beggar, a grieving ex-mistress, two prostitutes, and a young couple who, living with in-laws, have no place at home to make love. Reflected through the speeches of these characters are the hypocrisy and lack of compassion that tincture the national society. At the core of the drama is the sharp division between the in-group (mayor, landlady, and police) and the out-group composed of these Saroyanesque characters. In this work Gala marshals his symbols adroitly. The sealing of the mausoleum - once the outcasts have been driven off by the police - recalls the scene in Scripture after Christ had risen from the dead. A wounded dove typifies the abuse of the symbol of peace, and wasps are a danger to be avoided, for they 112 spring 1983</page><page sequence="9">represent the power elements in society who mistreat humble people. Gala's play on the long-lasting estrangement between the "winners" and "losers" in the Civil War is Noviembre y un Poco de Yerba (1967 - November and a Bit of Grass), which spotlights a Loyalist soldier who has hidden in a Spanish cellar for twenty-seven years after Franco's triumph. When he is finally convinced it is safe to return to "Spain/' he ascends the ladder clutching an ancient rifle, only to fall back and be killed accidentally by a rifle shot. A contrived ending, to be sure, yet there was nothing contrived about the story line, for in the late 1960s when Franco decreed a pardon for Loyalist sympathizers, several cases of such internal exiles surfaced. With the dawn of the Transition Era, Gala mixes politics and re- ligion in Petra Regalada (1979), which dramatizes the toppling of a ruthless chieftain. His successor proves to be another tyrant, who is quickly done away with, leaving a ray of hope. Gala seems to be prophe- sying that if Spain can prevent a future would-be dictator from seizing power, she will ultimately come to join the family of true democracies. Lauro Olmo (1922- ) relies on authentic local color and pun- gent, colloquial dialogue to frame his social criticism. He centers his dramatic attention on the bleak existence of Madrid's working class, pointing up a spiritual malaise which he knows at first hand. In La Camisa (1962 - The Shirt), the playwright explores the shantytown existence of proletarians in a Madrid slum. Alienated from the economic mainstream, they are forced to consider emigrating in order to survive. (During the 1950s some 300,000 Spaniards emigrated to Germany, Switzerland, and France to work in construction, in fac- tories, in service industries, or as domestics.) In the play's focal speech Lola, the protagonist, laments: "When we got married we came to live temporarily in this makeshift shelter ... do you know what it is to see a man cry? . . . the days without heat, the patches . . . always temporarily' . . . seventeen years have passed . . . too many . . . the best . . . with them our youth has vanished . . ." Jose Maria Recuerda ( 1925- ), while he saw some of his works of social criticism produced during the Franco years, had to wait until 1977 for his first major Madrid success: Las Arreco gias del Beaterío de Santa Maria Egipciaca {The Inmates of the Convent of Saint Mary Egyptian ). This historical play scores political repression. The Inmates , banned in 1970, re-creates the last day in the life of SOUTHWEST Review 113</page><page sequence="10">a nineteenth-century Spanish Liberal martyr, Mariana Pineda. During the absolutist regime of Fernando VII (1823-1833), she was accused of treason but was offered her freedom in exchange for revealing the names of Liberal leaders in Granada. Her refusal led to her execution. Thematically, the play constitutes an appeal to Spanish authorities to abandon political repression and to extend amnesty to political prisoners. Historical parallels were not lost on the Spanish audience, who read political repression of recent vintage into the work. As a leading Avant-gardist playwright, Manuel Martinez Mediero (1929- ) is known for his lively invention, his innovative stage- craft, and his aggressive theatricalization of such themes as political and sexual repression, alienation, and police intervention. In parables, fables, and allegories, Mediero draws his characters with a few quick strokes, leavens the stage action with music and verbal and visual humor, and aims for broad popular appeal. Las Hermanas de Búfalo Bill (1975 - The Sisters of Buffalo Bill) is a political parable whose social geography is the American Old West and whose dramatis personae are an older brother and his two sisters. The Old West provides a remote locale for a nearby problem; the play was written during the censorship. The brother stands as a surrogate for Franco, who was considered by his followers as a Big Brother (or Father) and who for thirty-seven years ruled the national household sternly for its own good. The sisters constitute that national household. And the political message? That family members who have long lived under Big Brother now have to face up to the need to exercise their own freedom. The Franco character, known as Amadeo, is a moral dinosaur who zealously protects his two sisters, Cleo and Semiramis, against all tempta- tion. He has them playing with puppets and keeps them - the national family - in protective chains. Someday, says Amadeo, outside forces may become so strong that he will not be able to contain them; in which case he will burn down this house and die with dignity. This is the playwright's reference to the siege mentality which Franco cultivated in his country, to win popular support, during 1939-1952. At that time he was a pariah in Europe, and Spain was excluded from the United Na- tions inasmuch as it was considered the last surviving bastion of Euro- pean fascism. 114 spring 1983</page><page sequence="11">After Amadeo dies, the sisters admit that he had oppressed them. In a hallucinatory sequence Amadeo returns from Purgatorio, explain- ing, "It was foolhardy to leave you alone in this miserable life." This is the theme of the "continuing impact" of Franco on Spaniards, due to their fear of - or devotion to - him beyond the grave. Says Cleo, "All I want is freedom, and now that we are alone, we ought to take advantage of it; we may not have another chance." Still, Semiramis continues to revere Amadeo. "He is eternal, and we can't go alone through life." Shortly thereafter, a baker, who had stopped by the house, is kid- napped by the two sisters, who lock him in the basement where they plan to share him sexually. Remarks Cleo, "It's good . . . this being able to do what you want." As Semiramis plans to join the captive baker, Amadeo descends from above announcing that he has been named their guardian angel. In this work the two sisters move from dependence to resentment and then to liberation, expressed by their prospective descent into "free love" (freedom of choice) as a means of revenge against the repressive moral code which had so long ruled their lives. With El Ultimo Gallinero (1969 - The Last Chicken Coop) Mediero moves into the field of political fable, producing a type of Spanish Animal Farm. The keeper of the chicken coop (Franco) is the rooster Hermógenes, who is threatened by internal dissension caused by his repressive rule. Surrounding him are members of the national family: the aristocracy (Don Pavo and Don Faisan, elderly and distrustful of change); the middle class (bourgeois rooster and bourgeois hen); and the masses (restive chickens). When sexual repression becomes an issue, a rebel rooster from without moves into the chicken coop and harangues the masses about liberty ("Hurrah for free love!"). The security forces appear ("Don't form groups," a well-known police order in Franco Spain). Rebel rooster is brutally killed, a revolt breaks out, leading to a carnage. At this point, intellectual rooster comes forward and, espying the corpses of his brother roosters, exclaims, "There are those who think peace is arming to the teeth and not letting anyone talk up." In the cruel world of the chicken coop, the action is rapid, the situa- tions are grotesque and humorous. And it all adds up to this: a group of young intellectuals are struggling against a dictator and an aging oligarchy. southwest Review 115</page><page sequence="12">Francisco Nieva (1929- ) writes grotesque tragicomedies, em- ploying idiosyncratic characters, imaginative settings, and semisurreal plots, aiming at a visually poetic theater. As a former stage designer, he empathizes with Artauďs belief that one should not concede pre- ponderant importance to the text, which is but one of several elements entering into "total theater." Nieva thus eschews psychological develop- ment of character and relies extensively on mimicry, music, and heraldic dialogue. Like Martinez Mediero, he considers sexual repression a surrogate for political repression. Nievas works include a gallery of erotic symbols, which serve to repudiate that sexual repression, and by extension Franco s political repression. La Carroza de Plomo Candente (1976 - The Carriage of Burning Lead) is a political farce, satiric in intent and surreal in dramatic pro- jection. It concerns Luis III, a supposed Spanish king who in 1840 has just ascended the throne. ("A new King," cries one character, "and Carlist [Civil] Wars in the offing.") In his chambers the king is attended by a barber, who sometimes joins him in bed to keep the king warm, by a priest who unhesitatingly does his bidding, and by his former wet nurse, now a witch. The king orders the priest to perform a "black marriage ceremony" involving a bullfighter and a goat. But the goat soon meta- morphoses into Venus and proceeds to tempt the men around the king. When the latter does not succumb, the witch cackles, "If that doesn't move you, you are only a stone King." By means of one pivotal theater image - that of an ineffectual, frivolous, and nonmacho king - Nieva conveys a disparaging view of the Spanish monarchy. This royal put-down was written in 1972 shortly after Franco had named Juan Carlos as his successor. At the time, Span- iards held Juan Carlos in only moderate esteem. Some termed him "Juan Carlos el Breve," implying that he would not last long on the throne. Also, as handpicked by Franco, he was expected to continue the dicta- tor's repressive measures. What Nieva and other Spaniards did not know in 1972 - and what was not yet apparent in 1976 when the play was produced - was that Juan Carlos would prove to be an able monarch who, working with key national figures in 1976-1979, would succeed in gradually dismantling Franco's authoritarian, centralized state and re- placing it with a constitutional monarchy. Luis Riaza (1925- ) mixes ceremonial rituals and surrealist 116 spring 1983</page><page sequence="13">effects to create his poetic theater. His characters lack psychological dimensions, and his plays do not follow a linear story line, all of which makes his a very difficult theater for Spanish audiences. In Retraio de una Dama con Perrito (1979 - Portrait of a Woman with a Little Dog), Riaza envelops his four characters in a stage climate having the consistency of a surrealist dream sequence. And he locates them in a frowzy old mansion at a Mediterranean resort around the turn of the century. The madame and the young artist, together with servants Benito and Francisca, bizarrely follow out instructions from a book of ceremonies. It seems that these ceremonies were instituted by the ruling group to assure their own perpetuation. The madame, harbor- ing a Proustian belief that she can recapture "time past," talks to her puppets. Her mummified face and those of the other characters are multiplied by their reflection in a series of mirrors deployed strategically around the stage. In due time the ceremonial action uncovers a deadly conflict between the madame and Benito - the master /slave dialectic. Benito strangles the madame, removes her clothes, and, transvestitelike, wears them himself. Behind this ceremonial presentation lies a social image, that of the passing of a decadent bourgeois ruling class, represented by the madame. By symbolic transference that passing can be related to the 1975 passing of the Franco way of life in Spain. Jose Ruibal (1925- ) is a trenchant satirist who has written eighteen plays, mostly short works ranging from fable and farce to allegory and parable. He cultivates a stylized dialogue and staffs his allegories with figures from anthropomorphic animal fables. In his major work, El Hombre y La Mosca (1969 - The Man and the Fly ) Ruibal elaborates a short parable on an abortive attempt to perpetuate a dictatorship. "The Man," who has ruled a mythical country for "seventy peaceful years," is now training a double to carry on his rule. His purpose is to foster the myth of his own immortality. The dictator and his double are walled off from the real world, for they live in a huge glass dome, into which a fly one day finds its way. When the double panics in fear of the fly, the dictator's ruse dies aborning. (In 1964 the regime celebrated "25 peaceful years" which Franco had given Spain. Evidence of the great number of Spaniards interested in a "per- petuation" of Franco, or his regime, is seen in the reception given a 1978 novel by Fernando Vizcaino Casas, Y al Tercer Año Resucito [And SOUTHWEST Review 117</page><page sequence="14">the Third Year He Came Back to Life ]. This novel, tapping the well- springs of nostalgia for the Franco Era, was the year's best seller.) Fernando Arrabal (1932- ) brings up the rear guard in this account of Avant-gardists only because, while Spanish born, he is con- sidered a member of the international Theater of the Absurd, has written mainly in French, and since 1959 has resided in Paris, where most of his plays have been premiered. Also, his dramatic point of departure is more metaphysical than political. While his works have been performed in the major theater capitals, censorship kept Arrabal off the Spanish stage until after 1975. By that time, many of his plays were known in translation to Spanish critics, intellectuals, students, and theater buffs. Unquestionably, Arrabal is the most acclaimed Spaniard active in the theater today. Although his plays reveal a kinship with those of Absurdists Samuel Beckett and Eugene Ionesco, Arrabal readily admits to a strong Spanish strain in his work. On the international theater front he is known for his surreal stagecraft, his jolting imagery, and his pro- vocative handling of such themes as sadomasochism, blasphemy, necro- philia, and cannibalism. Spanish political repression has twice made searing inroads into the Arrabal psyche: with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War (1936), Arrabal, at age four, witnessed the arrest of his father for political rea- sons; the father, a strong Loyalist, subsequently slipped out of a Franco jail and disappeared forever; in 1967 Arrabal, a self-exile on a short trip to Spain, was jailed in Madrid for penning an obscene and antinationalist inscription in one of his books for an "admirer" who turned out to be a police agent. After twenty-four days in prison and in a prison hospital - his tuberculosis had been reactivated - he was brought to trial and later acquitted, thanks mainly to the intervention of such international figures of Samuel Beckett, Jean-Paul Sartre, Günter Grass, and Peter Weiss, as well as that of several Spanish intellectuals. Back in Paris, Arrabal proceeded to write Et lis Passèrent des Menottes aux Fleurs ( 1969 - And They Put Handcuffs on the Flowers ), a political play which grew out of his own observations and conversa- tions with political prisoners in Madrid. Handcuffs was premiered in the French capital, where it was later banned, as it was in Sweden and Belgium. It was performed in New York during the 1971-72 season. It has not been put on in Spain. 118 spring 1983</page><page sequence="15">The title comes from a line in a poem by Federico García Lorca (1898-1936), who was the first major Spanish literary figure to run afoul of the Franco forces; he was shot to death in Granada. That line reads, . . the trains of manacled roses," an image of universal human oppression. Handcuffs is an episodic play which graphically re-creates the torture, anguish, memories, and fantasies - erotic, sadistic, and blasphemous - of prisoners who have been in jail for years. Among those memories and fantasies, often acted out by prisoners, are: - a prisoner accused of a sacrilegious act is confined to a cell without water or food; when he is found four months later, his forearms are gnawed away by his own teeth; - a priest falls into the hands of triumphant rebels, who tear out his eyes and castrate him; - a prisoner under sentence of death loses his power of speech shortly before that sentence is commuted to life imprisonment; - a gypsy 1S condemned to death by strangulation and is placed in a crucifix position; as he dies he urinates on stage, is later taken to an elevated spot where he is "reanimated," and is soon joined by followers who celebrate the end of repression. During the stage action Arrabal subjects the audience to blinking searchlights and the clanging of prison doors, all designed to give that audience an emotional taste of what it is to be a victim of ruthless police methods. What lies ahead for Spain's playwrights? A very active political future, to be sure. In view of the historical drama being played out in Spain today - with terrorism, political assassinations, and the threat of another coup d'état - the Transition Era promises to lead to one of two denouements: a laborious consolidation of democracy, or a sudden plunge back into dictatorship. Whichever the denouement, Spanish play- wrights will continue to keep one eye on the typewriter and the other on the political landscape. southwest Review 119</page></plain_text>
