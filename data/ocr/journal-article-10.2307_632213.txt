<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTICES OF BOOKS sanctuary of Poseidon at Isthmia. Although plastic vases and heads attached to vases are briefly discussed, the lamps and terracottas are only mentioned in passing, so that the full extent of coroplastic dedications is not clear. The catalogue is divided into two sections, 'context groups' and 'fabric and decoration'. In the former, individual deposits are discussed, and in the latter, individual vases and questions of art-history and attribu- tion. Particularly welcome is the discussion of the Corinthian outline style (pp. 192-234), as a non-export style, and as a corrective to the view standardly expressed in handbooks that Corinthian figured wares end c.550. The book is liberally illustrated with both photographs and profile drawings, with some figure drawings. The small size of the photographs is of little consequence for much of the pottery, where repetitive and simply decorated types are illustrated perfectly adequately (e.g. the kalathiskoi on pls. 8-9). They are supported by a representative selection of profile drawings. The vases of art-historical interest, primarily the Archaic figured pottery, are much less well served by the photographs, and a more generous format would have been an improvement, particularly since there are few figure drawings, and those of a rather messy style. These criticisms are rather of the format of the series than of the present volume, which is both clear and useful. K.W. ARAFAT King's College London CARPENTER (T. H.) Art and myth in ancient Greece: a hand-book. (World of art.) London: Thames and Hudson, 1991. Pp. 256, [138] plates. ?6.95. Carpenter's Art and myth in ancient Greece is limited to a discussion of mythological illustrations created during the archaic and classical periods. Attic vases naturally hold the centre of the stage, but works in other media are also included. The abundant illustrations-a total of 356-are for the most part of very good quality, even including the black-figure vases, which are particu- larly difficult to reproduce. The text, presumably addressed primarily to beginners in the field, is commendable in pointing out that some stories found in images differ from those preserved in surviving literature, that certain elements (or even figures) in a picture are purely decorative and have no narrative significance and that the identification of a person or a story is not always simple and straightfor- ward. For instance, C. does well in explaining to the novice that an attribute does not always automatically identify a figure (e.g. torches may be held by Demeter, Persephone or Hecate). C. usually presents a brief summary of the story of a myth, followed by mention of how, when, where, in what media and how often it was represented. This somewhat dry enumeration tends to be informative rather than inspiring and C.'s treatment of myth is altogether more in the spirit of Apollodorus than that of Ovid. His method is, nevertheless, efficient in providing a great deal of essential information with laudable economy. Such information could be valuable to a wide range of readers and it is therefore unfortunate that C. sometimes appears to forget the needs of his intended audience. There is, for instance, much mention (without explanation) of the shapes of vases and names of painters, neither of which is necessarily familiar to the 'classicist in the street'-much less to a Renaissance historian or to the general public, who will also find the failure to add 'BC' to dates before Christ a distinct stumbling block to ready understanding. In such a wide-ranging work there are bound to be errors and oversights: red-figure vases are twice dated to the first half of the 6th century (pp. 205 and 207); a line of text has dropped out of the first paragraph on p. 195 robbing it of sense; Apollo, not Artemis (as stated in the caption), backs up Hektor in fig. 305; and the caption for fig. 240 has been omitted entirely; but such flaws are of minor importance. More disturbing are the occasions when clarity has been sacrificed to the rule of an arbitrarily imposed-sometimes ill-judged-principle of consistency. For instance, C.'s discussion of the iconography of Zeus and Ganymede begins awkwardly with the Ovidian version, then works back to the 4th century BC image of eagle abducting boy, and finally concludes with the earliest pictorial convention, namely an anthropomorphic Zeus pursuing a youth. The justifi- cation for such an illogical mode of presentation is that the story is subsumed under the rubric 'metamorphoses of Zeus'. Another example of where consistency in small matters obscures clarity in greater ones occurs in C.'s chapter on 'Portraits of the Gods'. C. introduces the gods following the order in which they appear as guests attending the wedding of Peleus and Thetis (on the vases painted by Sophilos and Kleitias)-a device presumably intended as a refreshing change from the usual presenta- tion according to the Hesiodic genealogy or the schema of a hierarchic family. The device is unsuccessful, however, because so many mythological nobodies are among the first to arrive, while so important a goddess as Athena virtually brings up the rear. This book will no doubt be used by many people in many fields, and it is, therefore, particularly disappoint- ing that it does so little to convey either the charm and power of the myths or the imagination and subtlety of the artists who illustrated them.

These two books share a single starting point, the relationship of art to contemporary political develop- ments, the underlying belief being that art reflects society and should be seen in conjunction with other manifestations of society. This reviewer wholeheartedly agrees, although it is hardly a new approach as Francis claims, and his final chapter shows how established such an approach is (the generality of the unnamed opposition [p. 6] is frustrating). 217</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF BOOKS F.'s book is based on his Waynflete lectures given at Oxford in 1983, and edited after his death by Michael Vickers. F.'s thesis is that the Persian wars had a pervasive influence on Greek art in the 'generation following Xerxes' retreat' (p. 4). His preconception that the art of this period reflects the Persian wars inevitably results in many challenges being made to orthodoxy. The re-dating of Archaic art which has been championed by F. and Vickers is stated vigorously and unapologetically. There is, however, no rigorous examin- ation either of conventional chronology, or of the consequences of the revised chronology. For example, discussion of the pottery of the Marathon mound is consigned to a footnote (p. 134 n. 82), despite the fact that F.'s argument (based on the unorthodox procedure of dating the deposit by its earliest pottery) necessitates moving Sophilos from c.580 to c.490, and cramping the development of black-figure to about two decades. The consequences of this are considerable, not least for the practicalities of artistic production and workshop pro- cedure (see J. Boardman, AA 1988, 423-5). F. says of typological change that 'the measure of its supposedly steady march need not be directly calibrated with the progress of historical time' (p. 7). True, but this ignores the fact that there is a visible progression, and that there are real artists and generations. Here, the art-historical work of Beazley and his followers has been invaluable in providing a framework of relative dates (whatever one may think of the absolute dates). To compress this relative sequence without detailed justification is unac- ceptable; F. implicitly (and with a patronizing tone towards other scholars and his readers, as too often in this book) dismisses Beazley's contribution by referring to 'those who can read a stomach muscle here and a palmette there as if they were date-stamps' (p. 44). Does F. deny that there is a consistent development, and that it is reflected by stomach muscles and palmettes (and, by the same token, techniques and shapes)? If so, he implicitly, and without discussion or reasoning, rejects the basic method by which our relative chronology has been established. Issues must be argued and rejected or accepted, but they cannot be ignored simply because they are inconvenient for a pre-conceived theory. This illustrates F.'s pervasive and blinding self-belief, which, combined with his method, effectively guarantees the book's failure. Determination to see the art of the period as primarily reflecting the Persian wars precludes an objective interpretation of it (ironically, this is precisely what F. criticises Ross for doing in the 1850s [p. 110], a period when far less documentation was available than was to F). It also obscures the notable fact that there is only one vase which explicitly refers to a specific encounter with the Persians, the Eurymedon oinochoe (p.39; F. does not note its uniqueness). This oinochoe suggests that vase-painters could make explicit references to specific incidents. Since they rarely did so, we should instead look for general allusions to conflicts with Persians; relying on these scenes for a chronologi- cal framework is rash. But suppose we do want to interpret, say, scenes of the Fall of Troy as analogues for the Persian destruction, why should not a vase such as the Vivenzio hydria (F.'s fig. 13) allude to the sack of Miletos in 494 rather than to the sack of Athens in 480-479? Resistance (the most striking feature of the vase) was greater there than in evacuated Athens, and the Fall of Miletos which so moved Athenian audiences was written by a Milesian, Phrynichus (Hdt. 6.22). The play is not mentioned by F., although he mentions the Phoinissae twice (pp. 48, 69), obscuring the fact that the Persian Wars began with the Ionian revolt, not the invasion of Attica. F. poses an important question in asking: 'are we entitled to suppose that the decoration of a Greek pot is more than merely decorative?' (p. 39). The answer is clearly that it can be, but-and this is a point not faced by F-it will only be so in the case of a small minority of painted pots, i.e., in this context, those whose painters show an unusual interest in current events. The general run of Greek pots continues much the same with iconographic developments which can hardly be inter- preted as the result of the Persian wars, e.g. the dimin- ishing popularity of the symposion. There is much good scholarship in this highly read- able book, but it is badly misused. There is room for debate on the impact of the Persian wars: a view opposite to F.'s has been argued by Anthony Snodgrass (Archaic Greece [1980] 201-218), and not faced here, but the debate is not best served by the method enshrined in F.'s book. While Shapiro's conviction that art should not be seen in isolation is as strong as that of F., he begins from the premise that art might reflect specific political develop- ments, rather than that it does. Hence S. treats the influence of the Peisistratids with caution, concentrating on painted pottery, but also commenting valuably on architecture and sculpture, with an examination of cults of the gods and other figures in this wide-ranging and handsomely illustrated book. Although S. concentrates (perhaps unduly) on Athens, he also looks beyond, to sites in Attica traditionally associated with the Peisistrat- ids, such as Brauron (pp. 64-6) and Eleusis (pp. 67-83). S. freely admits his debt to John Boardman's work on possible links between Herakles, Theseus and contem- porary political developments, but never acts in the Prokrustean manner of F., cutting or extending his evidence to suit his thesis. The approach of Boardman is, however, not challenged, and a response to some of the points raised by R. M. Cook ('Pots and Pisistratan Propaganda' JHS 107 [1987] 167-9) would have been welcome. Indeed, this is a good illustration of one of the limitations of this book; although S. is meticulous in amassing evidence and allowing it to speak for itself, he is perhaps insufficiently critical and analytical. Maybe the most telling point is the issue of what mechanism is envisaged for the exercise of tyrannical influence on art. S. says that there is 'no question of giving Peisistratos credit for [the] transformation of a local pottery industry into a major international economic force, for this was well under way by the decade 560-50 when he was mostly in exile' (p. 5). One may well dispute whether the Athenian pottery industry can ever be regarded as 'a major international economic force'. But what of specific vases? S. answers largely in terms of the exceptional nature of the pots on which political influ- ence can be detected; that these are a small minority is acknowledged (p. 17). This is a key point if tyrannical influence is to be traced in the works of people who were artisans rather than party-political workers. 218</page><page sequence="3">NOTICES OF BOOKS Broader in its implications is S.'s belief that 'the presence in Athens of so many cults, the majority of them first introduced or significantly expanded under the Tyrants, helped to a considerable degree to determine the iconographic repertory of Attic vase-painters, and that the vases may in turn provide valuable primary evidence for the history of the cults' (p. 12). Clearly, this is different from political influence, and S. admits that there is no proof that vases reflected political developments (pp. 15-16). However, reflections of cults on vases are hard to find, and S. finds few parallels for the clear cult references in some Dionysiac scenes (pp. 99-100), referring wisely to iconographic changes as 'a response' to new cults (p. 52 on Apollo; cf. p. 16), rather than as representations of them. S. states of sixth-century Athens that 'narrative sculpture on temples was at a relatively primitive stage ... rather, it was the thousands of vases issuing from the Kerameikos which must have shaped most people's visual conception of their myths' (p. 12). There is a marked imbalance between the amount of narrative sculpture and the number of vases produced, although consideration of narrative sculptures need not have been confined to that from temples. (S. argues strongly for the small pedimental sculptures from the Akropolis as being from temples; it would be interesting to know his view of Boardman's sugggestion that some of the sculptures are from a house or palace of Peisistratos on the Akro- polis [Greek sculpture: the Archaic period (1978) 153- 4].) But even if vases were central in shaping popular conceptions of myths, they would be an inefficient means of spreading political messages since they were of their nature a private and far less visible medium. Is it not possible that the inadequacy of vases as political vehicles is related to the rise of narrative sculpture as a more public medium which was far more prominent than vases, and which could present a much more coherent iconography? S. mentions that the Peisistratids held power 'on and off' (p. 165) with intervening periods of exile (p. 2), an important point, since our chronology is not in most instances sufficiently precise to distinguish between, for example, 550 when Peisistratos was in exile, and 546 when his third tyranny began. Thus the half century or so of the Tyrants' era can be isolated as one of great activity in art and cult, but a distinction cannot be drawn between the years when they were in power (admittedly the greater period), and those when they were in exile. Thus the case for their specific influence must, in most cases, remain not proven. K.W. ARAFAT King's College London ARAFAT (K. W.) Classical Zeus: a study in art and literature. (Oxford monographs on classical archaeol- ogy.) Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1990. Pp. xvii + 225, [40] plates, [9] figs. ?50.00. Arafat's monograph on representations of Zeus during the classical period concentrates almost exclusively on vase painting. The heart of the work is the concisely presented catalogue of some 18 pages which reveals the contexts in which Zeus appears during the period under consideration and the popularity of each subject in numerical terms. The catalogue is further broken down chronologically (usually roughly into decades) so that one can see how the importance of a theme waxed and waned during the course of the classical period. The text offers a commentary on the catalogue and also presents a selection of relevant literary sources. The most striking iconographical innovation of the 5th century lies in the creation of pursuit scenes. A. lists pursuits of Ganymede separately from pursuits of women, but quite correctly combines the total number of both types of representation-a startling 128, of which the vast majority were painted before the middle of the century. Gigantomachies also proved popular-a total of 86-once again predominantly in the first half of the century. The next most popular type of scene involves libations (A. divides them into libations with and without Hera), a combined total of 61. The only other theme to appear in significant numbers is the representa- tion of divine births: 39. In about half of these Zeus is an onlooker, often a very interested one, as he is the father of the baby being born, but it is the other half that testify to that remarkable biological aberration in Greek mythology-the fact that Zeus himself gives birth to Athena and Dionysus. It is as if the Greeks felt that the supremacy of the supreme god was compromised if he were excluded from the most mysterious and extraordi- nary of all human functions: the act of parturition. Anatomical problems are neatly side-stepped by means of infants issuing forth from head or thigh, leaving genitalia intact. This must be the ultimate fantasy of male chauvinists threatened by feminists! In most other subjects Zeus appears merely as an onlooker and the numbers are not very large. Although in both title and introduction, A. makes it clear that he has set out to discuss vase painting and literature together, inevitably a certain imbalance occurs. The vase paintings are very restricted chronologically, while almost all of the literature cited is centuries away, either as early as Homer and Hesiod or as late as Apollodorus. This makes it difficult, perhaps artificial, to relate the two forms too closely. For instance, A. makes an effort to detect the strained relationship between Zeus and Hera reflected in some vase paintings. The evidence he draws on is at best extremely subtle, a matter of pose or facial expression, at worst purely negative, the tentative suggestion that the absence of Hera in some scenes showing a libation to Zeus may denote ill-feeling. It might be simpler to conclude that the visual and the literary traditions largely go their own separate ways as is the case with Herakles' relationship to Hera. There the antipathy that is so marked in myth is almost entirely absent from representational art (see LIMC V, pp. 165-6.) A. is generally cautious about making connections between vase painting and political attitudes, but he does suggest that the woman shown in pursuit scenes is often meant to be Aegina and the popularity of the theme is related to Athens' pursuit and capture of the island of Aegina. It is hard to see this as anything but very speculative and little persuasive evidence is adduced to explain why Zeus rather than Athena should be used to represent Athens' aspirations. 219</page></plain_text>
