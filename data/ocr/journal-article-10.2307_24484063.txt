When Douglas discovered that the model essay wasn't sufficient, he began using three col ored highlighters to foreground the organizational structure of the headings. This was enough for the student, who immediately started using the high lighters on her own essay and saw that hers did not follow a pattern. The most stubborn errors to cor rect, however, are the misconceptions, which often require more direct teaching to provide new infor mation. Nancy ended up teaching a short lesson on the relationship between common expressions in Shakespeare's time and the present day to demon strate everyday language usage in the 17 th century. We have witnessed improved student per formance, as measured by summative grades and state achievement tests, since we began using for mative assessment systems consistently for the last three years. Importantly, 98 percent of our students passed their English course last year with a C aver age or better. Our first-time pass rate on the ELA portion of the high school exit exam has improved from 91 percent in 2009 to 97 percent in 2012. Fifty-seven percent of our students scored at the proficient or advanced levels of the state achieve ment test in 2012, up from 47 percent in 2010. These summative assessment results are telling us that formative assessment is working. Conclusion By shifting our focus from grading summative as sessments to looking more closely for patterns of Nancy Frey and Douglas Fisher errors that can inform instruction, we discovered we had more time to analyze students' work in progress. But having time to do this is one thing; knowing what to do about the errors is another. Our experiences suggest that teachers should focus on a formative assessment system, rather than on a suite of individual formative assessment tools and tasks. As Grant Wiggins noted, a formative assess ment system requires purpose-driven instruction, systems for collecting and analyzing student work, and ways to organize responses to the errors that students make. The key for us has been error analy sis, as it has allowed us to use formative assessment data in a truly informed way. Works Cited Black, Paul, and Dylan Wiliam.
