GLASSOW ABSTRACT Test excavations at the site of Huistla in Jalisco, Mexico, yielded a series of ceramic types which is simi- lar to types or wares found in the coastal lowland strip of Nayarit and Sinaloa. These affiliations indicate an occupation during a period sometime between about A.D. 800 and 1200. A reappraisal of the Aztatlan complex, recently divided into a series of local phases by Kelley, Winters, and Grosscup, leaves the impression that, while subdivision of the complex is justifed in light of their new data, certain continuities in ceramic design styles between these phases still give substance to the Aztat- lan complex. KNOWLEDGE of west Mexican prehistory is presently in a sketchy and somewhat speculative state due to a dearth of published archaeological analyses. Because of this fact, the Etzatlan Project had for its purpose the in- vestigation of one of the many areas of west Mexico for which only cursory comment has appeared in the archaeological literature (Kelly 1948: 57-8), this being the region of the mu- nicipality of Etzatlan, approximately 60 km. west of Guadalajara (Fig. 2). As a portion of the Etzatlan Project's 1963-1964 field program, the site of Huistla, located during a 1962 recon- naissance, was sampled by test excavations. Since ceramic analyses are especially useful for constructing broad historical frameworks in which cultural processes can later be consid- ered, this paper presents such an analysis of the ceramics of Huistla as a contribution to the development of west Mexican archaeology. GEOGRAPHIC SETTING A large portion of the municipality of Etzat- lan includes the former Laguna de Magdalena, originally about 20 km. long. During the course of this project and the 1962 survey, sites were located along the periphery of the former lake and on several of the islands which existed before draining. This area of Jalisco is in the highlands, at an altitude of about 1500 m. above sea level and with an average rainfall of about 80 cm. per year (Tamayo 1963: 120). The reasonably verdant terrain surrounding the lake is either hilly or mountainous, and the old lake bottom, now an alluvial flatland, offers a sharp contrast with the surrounding relief. The site of Huistla is located, like the present town of Etzatlan, on the southern borderlands of the former lake, nestled against rough mountainous terrain (Fig. 1). Located on a sloping alluvial fan, the site is less than a kilometer from the southwestern edge of the town of Etzatlan and 1 km. from the margin of the former lake. The southern and western borders of the site are delineated by a spring-fed arroyo. The eastern edge of the site abuts against a steep hillside, and the northern edge, which is not clearly demarcated, fades out toward a dry tributary of the arroyo (Fig. 2). CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MIDDEN Midden soil in the areas tested at Huistla varies from a few centimeters to over one meter deep. The deepest deposits, with the richest artifact yield, appear to be at the southern end of the site. Here the midden is dark brown or gray in color with a fairly high content of clay. Sterile soil is usually sharply differentiated from the midden and consists of either a medium brown, compact clay soil or a compact clay de- posit which serves as a matrix for cobbles. Down-slope from the deepest portion of the site, the midden becomes lighter in color and less friable; sherds are smaller and less abun- dant per unit volume. Evidently, much of this is a secondary deposit which has washed down from the thicker deposits above. The abrasion of the sherds from the lower area supports this interpretation. NATURE OF THE EXCAVATION Excavations at Huistla had the essential pur- pose of acquiring a stratigraphic sample for chronological purposes. For the past decade the Etzatlan area has yielded quantities of large hollow figurines associated with interments in shaft tombs. Up to the time of the Etzatlan Project, only looters had exploited the archaeo- logical resources of this area, and the chrono- logical and cultural contexts of these shaft- tombs were almost completely unknown. Huistla was one of the sites chosen for test pits in hopes of correlating its midden deposit with a heavily disturbed shaft-tomb area directly 64</page><page sequence="2">CERAMICS OF HUISTLA FIG. 1. The region around Etzatlan looking northeast from a hill above Huistla. The site is the plowed field in the lower left corner. south of the site on the opposite side of an arroyo. Although a wall foundation and other fea- tures were exposed during the course of excava- tion, their exposure was incidental to the pri- mary purpose of obtaining a stratigraphic sam- ple from the site. The basic excavation unit was a pit 1.5 m. square dug in 20-cm. levels down to sterile soil. Ten pits were dug, ran- domly located on the areas with promising sur- face indications. Two pits were shallow, and sterile soil was encountered within 40 cm. of the surface. Six, however, yielded good sam- ples; four of these were put into the rich mid- den at the top of the site. Where a wall foun- dation was encountered in two adjacent pits, excavation stopped at the 40-cm. level, and the foundation was followed out to its termination (Fig. 3). A total of 14.85 cubic meters of soil was processed for artifacts. Since the laborers were closely supervised and were instructed to search all midden soil with trowels before setting it aside, controls were probably rigorous enough to permit a statistical analysis. Features. The corner of a wall foundation and an adjacent firepit (Fig. 3) were encoun- tered between 15 and 27 cm. below surface in pits 4 and 5. The two sides, 4.2 and 1.5 m. in length, are 30 cm. thick and 25 cm. high. Along the length of the longer segment (oriented NNE-SSW) there is a gap which was possibly a vent for the adjacent basin-shaped firepit. No associated floor level could be recognized. Two features involving rock slabs and a mol- cajete were also encountered. The first was recorded by S. V. Long during the 1962 surface reconnaissance of Huistla and was found near the center of the site, having been badly dis- turbed by looters. A complete molcajete (Fig. 5 d) was surrounded by a series of flat slabs forming a bucket-shaped enclosure. Many large potsherds were in the fill of the enclosure. These include the following types and frequen- cies: 20 Orange-on-buff, 8 Huistla Polychrome, 3 Plain Burnished-black, and 1 White and Brown-on-orange. The second such feature (Fig. 4), located in pit 3, was a circular pave- ment 80 cm. in maximum diameter occurring 63 cm. below surface. Its open center con- tained a badly eroded molcajete which lacks supports. A crumbly yellow clay, much lighter than the surrounding soil, adhered to the rock slabs and filled the cracks between them. The surrounding soil was nearly sterile. These two features may be associated with culinary areas. CERAMIC TYPES In many respects the typology presented here is preliminary since many of the divisions con- tain such small numbers of sherds that a true idea of range of variation cannot be deter- mined. The term "type" is used for all divi- sions in the typology; however, it is obvious that when more is known about the ceramics of the Etzatlan region - and about ceramics of FIG. 2.

The limit of the contoured area equals the approximate limits of the site. 65 GLASSOW ]</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY FIG. 3. Rock foundation encountered in pits 4 and 5, looking southeast. western Mexico in general - some of the "types" presented here may be subdivided. Huistla Polychrome and Acueducto Red-on- buff are given proper names since, compared to the other types having descriptive labels, they contain relatively high sherd frequencies and are stylistically homogeneous. The main criteria for differentiating the ce- ramic categories are design and surface treat- ment, and for the most part these categories were easily recognized from one another during sorting. Only in the case of the type Buff Miniature Vessels was vessel size considered the defining criterion. It should also be noted that for many of the types there is one or more dis- tinctive vessel form. Speaking of the Huistla collection as a whole, a high, glass-like burnish is absent from the bur- nished sherds, which instead have more of a satin-like burnish. Sherd size is small, usually less than 8 cm. in maximum dimension, and two molcajetes were the only complete vessels encountered. The high amount of fragmenta- tion necessitates such items as supports, han- dles, and applique to be considered separately, both in the type descriptions and in the fre- quency distribution tables, since they often lack an adequate amount of vessel body to which they were attached for assignment to one or more specific types. The quantities of undeco- rated types indicated in Table 1 are of rim sherds only, the body sherds having been dis- carded in the field due to logistical strictures. Paste Composition. Pastes of Huistla ceramics are divided into three categories based on differ- ences in color. The first comprises most of the types in the collection; the second Plain Orange; and the third Plain Brown. Differ- ences in temper may also exist, but this cannot be ascertained due to the small number of Plain Orange and Plain Brown sherds, coupled with the relatively broad variations in temper from one sherd to another in all three cate- gories. The paste of the first category, including most of the types, is divided into two distinct subcategories based on a dichotomy between buff-colored (oxidized) and burnished-black (reduced) sherds. In both subcategories the paste colors in the Munsell color system fall within the ranges of plain surface colors given in the individual type descriptions. About 20% of the buff sherds exhibit firing clouds or dark areas, and about 30% of the burnished-black sherds have light areas. About 50% of the buff sherds have a dark core. The tempering material is basically the same for both subcategories, although it shows con- siderable variation throughout the collection. Most often the temper particles are "very fine" to "fine" in the Wentworth size classification; however, occasionally sherds have sporadic "medium" or "coarse" particles. They are usu- ally rounded or subangular in shape which indicated that the source was probably local sands. Felspar is always present in quantities no lower than about 50% while quartz, basalt, obsidian, and chert occur in lesser quantities, sometimes being totally absent. Abundance of tempering particles also varies from about 10% to over 50% of the paste volume. The paste of the Plain Orange type, differen- tiated from the above because of its distinctive orange color, has tempering constituents simi- FIG. 4.

The particles are larger, however, being "fine" to "coarse" in the Wentworth classification. A slight to prominent carbon streak is present on all but two sherds. The felspar particles, subangular or rounded in shape, are very noticeable in the darker matrix of the paste. The Plain Brown paste is distinctively brown in color; however, the material, size, and abun- dance of temper is similar to that of the first category. Surface Color. Surface colors have been sub- divided into two categories: 1) plain surfaces which coincide with paste colors, and 2) painted surfaces. Under plain surfaces are the Buff surface (which takes in the majority of the sherds in the collection), the Burnished- black surface, and the various plain surfaces of the rare or aberrant types. The surface colors as they are designated in the individual type descriptions are merely for rough descriptive and comparative purposes.

INDIVIDUAL TYPE DESCRIPTIONS Type: Huistla Polychrome (Fig. 5 a-d). 387 sherds. Surface colors: red and brown paints on a plain buff background. Surface finish: burnished (after application of paints). Vessel wall thickness: 0.5 to 0.9 cm., av. 0.7 cm. Vessel and rim forms: Two vessel forms: 1) Hemis- pheric molcajetes with solid, somewhat bulbar or con- tracting tripod supports, usually with an exterior sub- rim flange averaging 2 to 3 cm. below the rim. Scoring of the inner surface is usually in quadrants and aver- ages from 3 to 7 cm. between scores. 2) Bowls which are either hemispheric or somewhat flat-bottomed, usu- ally without tripod supports. Sub-rim flange is rare. Decoration: Red and brown paints applied to the buff background. On molcajetes the decoration is restricted to an interior band, usually less than 4 cm., at the rim of the vessel. Alternating series of red and brown lines comprise the most common band decoration, invariably beginning with a red rim and most often followed by brown lines, a broad red line, and again two brown lines. In place of the two upper brown lines a series of wavy or crisscross lines sometimes occurs. On bowls the design begins with similar red and brown lines just below the rim which are usually fol- lowed most often by a curvilinear design or by red lines outlined by brown. Several sherds of relatively vertical- sided vessels exhibit exterior instead of the usual interior decoration. Tripod supports of both molcajetes and bowls usually have a blotch of red paint roughly applied to their upper surfaces. The lines of banded designs are usually straight and uniform in thickness, while the cur- vilinear designs of bowls are carelessly applied. Discussion: Sherds of this type are easily singled out from the collection because of a distinctive and con- sistent combination of attributes: red and brown paints on a burnished-buff background. Type: Acueducto Red-on-buff (Fig. 5 e-h). 359 sherds. Surface color: red on a plain buff background. Surface finish: low to high burnish. Vessel thickness: 0.4 to 0.8 cm., av. 0.6 cm. Vessel and rim form: Hemispheric bowls, typically with flat bases and gradually outcurving to slightly incurving sides. Size appears to have varied greatly with diameters from about 15 to 30 cm. Decoration: Rims are invariably red-banded. This band, generally between 0.4 and 2.0 cm. in breadth, is located along with the rest of the design on the interior or exterior of the vessel. Bowls may occur with only the rim band, lacking any other design, but most often a more elaborate design is present, predominantly on the bowl interiors. Typically, two concentric lines follow the red rim (av. 0.2 cm. thick and spaced 0.2 to 0.4 cm. apart), and then a horizontal band or more elaborate, FIG. 5.

These motifs, repeated the circumference of the vessel, are composed of lines usually less than 0.2 cm. in thickness. Scrolls, concentric circles, or combinations of vertical or diagonal, straight or wavy lines are the most common elements of these motifs. Dots, crosshatching, solid triangles, series of short parallel lines, steps, and rec- tangles occur in lesser frequencies, usually as comple- mentary elements to those mentioned above. Following the band of more elaborate motifs, a series of narrow or broad concentric lines seems always to be present. The center of the bowls is either blank or filled with the above-mentioned motifs. The few exterior-decorated bowls exhibit much the same arrangement of motifs. One variant of the interior-decorated bowls has merely a series of concentric red bands, generally 0.2 to 0.8 cm. thick, which are spaced at intervals of similar thick- ness until they are near the center of the bowl. Discussion: Red-on-buff design motifs are similar to those of the incised and engraved types; however, with the red-on-buffs the motifs are more elaborate. Three sherds, with seeming differences in paste, may not be locally made. One of these sherds is of a highly-bur- nished bowl with a flat base and sides which break from the base and flare outwards. The red paint occurs on the rim as a narrow band and surrounding holes, 0.7 cm. in diameter, which go through the sherd. Of the two holes on the sherd, one is in the base and the other is on the side. Two other sherds exhibit a bright orange paste and a relatively high burnish. The design motifs on the exterior surface are similar to the rest of the red-on-buff lot. Type: White-on-red (Fig. 5 i-j). 154 sherds. Surface colors: white paint on a painted red background, with a plain buff surface sometimes left showing. (White is somewhat fugitive.) Surface finish: burnished (before application of white paint). Vessel thickness: 0.4 to 0.9 cm., av. 0.6 cm. Vessel and rim forms: Small ollas not exceeding a maxi- mum diameter of about 30 cm., and with variable unde- termined heights. Necks are probably all recurved and the three rim sherds of this type exhibit an exterior, rounded rim flange. A distinct but rounded shoulder occurs on at least some of the vessels at about the midpoint of the vessels' height. Decoration: A red paint was applied either only to the upper half of the vessel, oi, less surely, to the complete exterior. The white designs are linear with occasional dotted lines supplementing. The most typical motif is a series of horizontal parallel lines, usually only two, and it occurs either alone or in combinations with hachures, dots, or curvilinear elements. The width of the lines seldom exceeds 0.3 cm., and the motif is carefully exe- cuted relative to other types in the collection. A possi- ble variant of this type has a decorative motif consisting of broad red bands (usually over 1 cm. in breadth) bordered with thin white lines on a plain buff surface. Discussion: The use of fine white lines in the deco- rative motifs occurs in the White and Brown-on-orange type also; in fact, white motifs consisting of dots, paral- lel lines, and hachures are about the same for both types. Type: White and Brown-on-orange (Fig. 5 k-m). 79 sherds. Surface color: white (somewhat fugitive) and grayish- brown paints on a painted orange background. Surface finish: dull-burnished (prior to application of white and grayish-brown paints). Vessel thickness: 0.5 to 0.7 cm. Vessel and rim form: Primarily relatively large ollas with maximum diameters to about 60 cm. A smaller size is represented by at least two sherds. Four rim sherds which exhibit an exterior rim flange are probably from large ollas, and one small rim sherd is from a bowl. Decoration: The exteriors were probably completely cov- ered with the orange paint. Brown paint appears as broad lines, horizontal or curvilinear, ranging from 0.4 to 1.8 cm. in thickness, and most often bordered by thin white lines. A row of white dots may run along the center of the broad brown lines. White paint also occurs separately from the brown in motifs as closely- spaced parallel lines or bands of diagonal hachures, bor- dered by parallel white lines. Sherds of smaller vessels have identical but smaller motifs. Discussion: This type could be considered an elaborate version of the Orange-on-buff type (described below). The vessel form, while probably averaging slightly smaller, is identical to that of the Orange-on-buff type (except for the one bowl sherd). On the other hand, the white motifs are very similar to those of the White- on-red type. Type: Incised Polychrome (Fig. 5 n-o). 75 sherds. Surface color: red, orange, pink, brown, and white paints (the latter two are somewhat fugitive) covering prob- ably the whole surface of the vessels. Surface finish: burnished (probably after application of the paints). Vessel thickness: 0.4 to 0.8 cm., av. 0.6 cm. Vessel and rim forms: Flat-bottomed bowls with diame- ters at the rim probably less than 30 cm. and heights less than 10 cm. Sides tend to flare out, and on one example a rounded flange protrudes outward at the base of the vessel side. Decoration: Red is the dominant color used, while the others occur in lesser amounts in about equal propor- tions. The vessels usually have red rims, although some are white; often one or more brown or white bands occur just below the rim. Each band is delimited from adjacent ones by an incised line. The geometric and/or rectilinear designs occur either on the interior, the ex- terior, or on both surfaces. The motifs consist of zones of color which are divided from each other by incised lines. A zone usually has one color; however, a second color may appear as a line running through the zone. Some zones may be unpainted, but this cannot be abso- lutely determined because such paints as white or brown may have been eroded off these surfaces. Exterior deco- ration tends to occur on vessels with more vertical sides. Occasionally the interior is solid red. Motifs are usually combinations of elements repeated around the circum- ference of the vessel. Discussion: This type is one of the most elaborate in the collection in both design layout and number of colors. Sherds, even though eroded to a large extent, are easily 70 [ VOL. 32, No. 1, 1967</page><page sequence="8">CERAMICS OF HUISTLA recognized on criteria of vessel shape and presence of incision, as well as the presence of one or more of the colors still intact. Type: White and Brown-on-red (Fig. 5 p). 1 sherd. Surface color: burnished prior to application of white paint. Vessel thickness: 0.5 cm. Vessel and rim forms: Shallow, open bowl with a slight- ly out-flaring rim, no more than 8 cm. high and 15 cm. in diameter. Decoration: The sherd has a painted red background which covers all the interior and the exterior until 2.0 cm. below the rim. The white paint is used in highly elaborate, fine-line motifs consisting of parallel and curvi- linear rows of dots and circles placed on the interior only. Motifs are small compared to those on sherds of other types in the collection. A brown band 0.2 cm. thick occurs just below the rim. Discussion: This type, unique in the combination of colors, is most distinctive in the elaboration of small motifs. The form could possibly fit into the ranges of Incised Polychrome bowls. Type: Pink and Brown-on-red (Fig. 5 q). 1 sherd. Surface color: pink (somewhat fugitive) and brown paints on a painted red background. Surface finish: Burnished prior to the application of pink paint. Vessel thickness: 0.7 cm. Vessel and rim forms: A molcajete with an exterior sub- rim flange. The parallel grooves of the interior scoring pattern are spaced 0.4 cm. apart and are about 0.2 cm. deep. The form corresponds to that of the Huistla Poly- chrome molcajetes. Decoration: The interior area above the scoring pattern (3.2 cm. below the rim) and the exterior, to the flange 2.8 cm. below the rim, are painted red. On the interior three concentric brown lines are evenly spaced on the red field, and between the upper two lines a pink band fills the space. Discussion: While conforming to Huistla Polychrome in vessel form and presence of interior horizontal decora- tive bands, this type is distinctive because of the un- usually coarse scoring pattern, the use of pink paint, and the application of red paint on the exterior down to the flange. Type: Polychrome-on-red (Fig. 5 r). 1 sherd. Surface color: Orange, white, pink, and brown (all somewhat fugitive) paints on a painted red surface. Surface finish: burnished, probably after application of all paints. Vessel thickness: 0.7 cm. Vessel and rim forms: probably an open bowl with out- curving sides and flaring rim. Decoration: Orange and pink paints are superimposed on white, white is superimposed on brown or red, and brown is superimposed directly on the red. All the orange paint, excepting a few very small areas, had scaled off, probably due to the fugitive character of the white paint onto which it is painted. The brown paint forms a line 0.3 cm. thick just below the rim as well as some curvilinear elements below this. A line of white dots is superimposed on the brown rim band; and white along with pink paint occurs as blotches in association with the brown curvilinear elements. The composition of the orange elements is indiscernible. The arrange- ment of these four colors into motifs cannot be deduced from this small sherd. Discussion: The presence of these four colors on a red background makes this type distinct from the rest. The brown rim band covered with white dots is nearly identical to an element on the White and Brown-on-red sherd. Vessel form is probably the same as the bowls of the Incised Polychrome type. Type: Engraved Burnished-black (Fig. 5 g-v). 94 sherds. Surface color: black. Surface finish: burnished. Vessel thickness: 0.4 to 0.9 cm., av. 0.5 cm. Vessel and rim forms: Flat-bottomed bowls with in- curved, nearly vertical, or out-curved sides. The sides merge imperceptibly with the base. All vessels of this shape were probably under 20 cm. in diameter and 10 cm. in height. Decoration: Several more or less distinct decorative pat- terns are present. All consist of engraving (some may be incising) which was often, if not always, filled with an impermanent red ochre. One pattern which occurs on the bowls consists of a series of two to eight parallel, closely-spaced, engraved lines on the exterior near the rim. Occasionally vertical hatching, forming repeated triangles, is appended to the lowest of these parallel lines. A more common pattern is an exterior design consisting of a decorative band about 1.5 to 2 cm. thick running the circumference of the vessel just below the rim. This band is composed of repeated panels com- posed of curvilinear motifs and separated from each other by vertical lines. Two or three horizontal lines delimit the band of repeated motifs on the top and bottom. Directly below the parallel band a series of scallops radiating out from the base may be present. The same parallel-band pattern is less frequently on the interior of the bowls. Two small polished black sherds lumped into this type are from bowls with a notched or serrated rim (about 5 serrations per 1 cm. of circum- ference), but otherwise there is no engraving present. Discussion: This type, Plain Burnished-black, Exuberant- ly-engraved Burnished-black, Fluted Burnished-black, and Deeply-incised Burnished-black are the only reduced types. The five types, however, do not occur in identi- cal vessel forms. Plain Burnished-black bowls, for in- stance, are larger and thicker-walled, tending to be more hemispheric and lacking as flat a base as the others. Type: Exuberantly-engraved Burnished-black (Figs. 5 w and 6 a). 3 sherds. Surface color: black. Surface finish: burnished. Vessel thickness: 0.6 to 0.8 cm. Vessel and rim forms: Open bowls with nearly vertical sides which break sharply from a gently-rounded base. On the two sherds on which measurements could be made, the sides from the break are 3.5 cm. high, and the overall vessel height probably does not exceed 8.0 cm. An exterior flange forms a flat, horizontal lip at the rim. Maximum diameter is around 25 cm. GLASSOW ] 71</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Decoration: Abundant engraving covers the interior of one sherd and both the interior and exterior of the other sherd from which this could be ascertained. The hori- zontal lip on all three sherds is covered with a repeated design, on one with triangles of diagonal hachures and on the other two with repeated double concentric circles connected to each other by intervening lines. A panelled design of repeated motifs separated by vertical lines occurs on the interior sides of the two larger sherds. Motifs are composed of curvilinear elements and rows of dots, but their full composition cannot be deduced. On the interior base of one sherd, hachured triangles (occurring also on the lip of the vessel) apparently are repeated over the complete area of the base. The ex- terior of the other sherd is covered with two interlock- ing wave elements. Discussion: Although similar to Engraved Burnished- black, this type has more abundant and more elaborate engraving as well as a highly distinctive vessel shape, and it apparently lacks red ochre rubbed into the engraving. Type: Deeply-incised Burnished-black (Fig. 6 b). 12 sherds. Surface color: black. Surface finish: burnished (after incision). Vessel thickness: 0.4 to 0.7 cm., av. 0.5 cm. Vessel and rim forms: Hemispheric bowls; probably all with incurved rims. Maximum diameter probably did not exceed 25 cm.; the height is indeterminable. Decoration: Vertical lines were incised on the exterior of the vessel while the clay was still in a plastic state. These incisions begin at an unknown distance from the base of the vessel and extend to within about 1 cm. of the rim, often occurring in parallel groups of two or more. Depth, broadness, evenness, and amount of obliteration of the incisions vary considerably. Depth is consistently more than 1 mm., and the spacing between the incisions is generally between 0.3 and 0.8 cm. One sherd exhibits a sharp shoulder which probably was about midway up the height of the complete vessel. About half the sherds of this type exhibit areas of oxi- dation, probably due to firing accidents. Discussion: This type is related both in vessel form and surface finish to Engraved Burnished-black, although the former appears to be a more closely-knit category. Type: Fluted Burnished-black (Fig. 6 h). 12 sherds. Surface color: black. Surface finish: lightly burnished. Vessel thickness: 0.4 to 0.9 cm. Vessel and rim forms: No rim sherds are present. Ves- sel form appears to be some form of olla. One sherd exhibits a well-defined shoulder which must have been toward the middle of the whole vessel. Decoration: Horizontal, parallel, regularly undulating flutes or ripples ranging between 0.8 and 1.2 cm. from peak to peak comprise the only decoration of these sherds. Type: Wavy-incised (Fig. 6 c). 6 sherds. Surface color: buff. Surface finish: very lightly burnished. Vessel thickness: 0.5 to 0.7 cm. Vessel and rim forms: Low, vertical-sided bowls or basins, probably with rounded bottoms. Maximum diam- eter probably is under 25 cm., and the height of the sides from their break from the base is about 3.0 to 3.5 cm. (based on measurements of two sherds). Decoration: Incised, geometric designs occur on the ex- terior, consisting of repeated groups of broad vertical or diagonal incisions which are either straight or squiggled. The incisions average about 0.3 to 0.4 cm. in thickness and about 0.1 to 0.2 cm. in depth. Type: Obliterated-incised (Fig. 6 d-e). 4 sherds. Surface color: buff. Surface finish: very lightly burnished. Vessel thickness: 0.5 to 0.7 cm. Vessel and rim forms: Vessel form unknown; sherds are too few and too small for interpretations; however, the incising is on the convex surface of the sherds. Decoration: Incised curvilinear designs, probably rela- tively open, are the only mode of decoration. The in- cisions have been gone over while the clay was still plastic with a blunt instrument which modified the incisions into shallow, rounded depressions. Sherds are too small to ascertain motifs. Type: Miscellaneous incised (Fig. 6 f). 27 sherds. Surface color: plain black, red, or buff. Surface finish: lightly burnished with some variation. Vessel thickness: 0.4 to 1.2 cm. Vessel and rim forms: Size is so small on all but a few sherds that vessel form cannot be ascertained. Probably most sherds came from relatively small bowls. Decoration: Incised lines form simple geometric or curvi- linear designs. Breadth of the incisions varies from con- siderably less than 0.1 cm. to about 0.2 cm. Most of these sherds are too small to deduce any of the motifs. Type: Buff Miniature Vessels (Fig. 6 g). 4 sherds. Surface color: buff. Surface finish: burnished. Vessel thickness: 0.3 to 0.6 cm. Vessel and rim forms: Two squat ollas with recurved necks and one hemispheric bowl. Maximum diameter of either form does not exceed 10 cm. nor does the height exceed 5 cm. Decoration: All three are unpainted but burnished on the exterior. The larger olla sherd has applique nub- bins placed horizontally at about 3 cm. intervals along its maximum diameter. FIG. 6.

Type: Plain Burnished-black (Fig. 6 i). 335 sherds. Surface colors: black. Surface finish: burnished. Vessel wall thickness: 0.4 to 0.9 cm., av. 0.6 cm. Vessel and rim forms: Predominantly hemispheric open bowls with rounded rims, tending to be shallow. Rim diameter probably does not exceed 40 cm. and height probably averages 10 to 15 cm. Minor vessel forms were ollas with recurved necks (size approximating that of Orange-on-buff and Plain Buff types) and molcajetes (two small sherds). Some vessels must have had sup- ports of either the Ring type or the Solid Flat type (see support descriptions). Decoration: The interior of the bowls (and exterior of the ollas) is highly burnished, while the bowl exteriors sometimes lack a burnish or are only lightly burnished. There is no painted decoration, and it is doubtful that a slip or wash was added. Discussion: Compared to the other burnished-black types, Plain Burnished-black lacks decoration of any sort, and although it occurs in bowl forms as do the decorated types, Plain Burnished-black bowls are larger, thicker walled, and more open. Type: Orange-on-buff (Fig. 6 j-p). 1204 sherds. Surface color: plain buff and/or painted red-orange. Surface finish: smoothed to lightly burnished. Vessel thickness: Ollas with rim flange: at rim: 0.8 to 1.4 cm., av. 1.0 cm. body: 0.4 to 0.9 cm., av. 0.6 cm. Ollas with recurved neck: at rim: 0.6 to 1.2 cm., av. 0.9 cm. body: 0.4 to 1.0 cm., av. 0.7 cm. Vessel and rim forms: Large ollas (largest in the col- lection) with recurved, or sometimes approaching verti- cal, necks. The rim diameter probably ranges from about 15 to 40 cm., while the broadest portion of the body probably ranges from 30 to 150 cm. in diameter. Height may have had a range similar to the broadest diameter. Rims are of two types: 1) simple recurved and 2) ex- terior flange or lip on a recurved or nearly vertical neck. While the recurved rims are relatively uniform in shape, the flanged rims have several crosscutting ranges of variation: narrow to broad in height, flat or protruding, rounded or overhanging. Generally speaking, the flanged rims from the largest ollas tend to be more flat and rounded. Comales also occur, being very shallow and probably with heights not exceeding 15 cm. As in the ollas, the rim tends to thicken slightly from the body of the vessel, and occasionally the gentle, uniform curvature of the comal will be upturned slightly near the rim. While most all comal circumferences appear to be circular, a few sherds exhibit an angle, as if the overall shape were polygonal. Handles of a simple loop type may also be present, extending horizontally out from the comal's rim. Decoration: Ollas are monochrome red-orange or bi- chrome buff and red-orange. In the case of the bi- chromes, a series of horizontal red-orange bands occurs beginning just below the rim and continuing for an unknown distance toward the base. These bands are 0.8 to 2.0 cm. in breadth with intervals usually less than 1.0 cm. Variations such as narrow or broad diagonal, criss- crossing bands occur sporadically. Occasionally body sherds from near the midpoint of the vessel's height will have a ridge or flange running horizontally around the vessel's circumference. This ridge may be rounded or "hogbacked," and it tends to be larger (0.3 to 1.0 cm. in height) with increased overall size of the olla. Often the ridge is regularly indented or notched at intervals from 0.7 to 4.0 cm., or, as in one case, instead of notches, there are punched circles made with a hollow cylindrical device. One sherd has two parallel ridges 2 cm. apart. In about half the cases, the red-orange paint is not continued below this ridge. Comales have dark-gray, roughened undersides, while the upper surface is either plain buff or bichrome, the latter composed of bands nearly 4 cm. in breadth which cross and/or crisscross the surface. Rims have a band of similar thickness running along the circumference. Six comal sherds are so dark that they may be actually burnished-black, rather than red-orange or buff. But since this number is so small, these sherds probably are mere- ly misfirings. Type: Plain Buff (Fig. 6 n-s). 304 sherds. Surface color: buff. Surface finish: smoothed to lightly burnished. Vessel thickness: (for ollas and comales, see data for Orange-on-buff vessels of the same form.) Plaques: 0.7 to 1.2 cm., av. 0.8 cm. Vessel and rim forms: Ollas and comales are of the same body and rim forms as those of the Orange-on- buff type. Plaques are flat, rectangular slabs of unknown size (at least 20 cm. along each side). One side of the slab is smoothed or lightly burnished, while the other side is scored or striated by means of dragging a rough, flat object across the plastic surface in one direction only. These striae, usually beginning 1 to 2 cm. from the plaques' margins, are carefully applied, all being straight and parallel to one of the sides of the slab. The edges are rounded and the corners, while forming right angles, are also rounded. Decoration: None. Type: Plain Orange (Fig. 6 t). 9 sherds. Surface color: orange. Surface finish: light, uniform burnish. Vessel thickness: 0.5 to 0.9 cm., av. 0.7 cm. Vessel and rim forms: Open, shallow bowls, probably not exceeding 30 cm. in diameter nor 15 cm. in height. One sherd has an exterior flange about 20 cm. below the rim. Decoration: Probably all sherds were slipped with a ma- terial nearly the same color as the orange paste. Two sherds have added a slightly darker red paint, in one case an interior band just below the rim and in the other case broad splotches of color. Discussion: More than one type may be represented in this grouping since there is some variation in paste, surface finish, and hardness. Four of the sherds exhibit a paste which is clearly divergent from the typical paste of the collection, being harder and denser and contain- ing a light-colored tempering material. 74 [ VOL. 32, No. 1, 1967</page><page sequence="12">CERAMICS OF HUISTLA TABLE 2.

Surface color: brown. Surface finish: lightly burnished and smoothed. Vessel thickness: 0.5 to 0.7 cm. Vessel and rim forms: Three of the four sherds compris- ing this rare type have a complete hollow leg attached. These three vessels, two bowls and one molcajete, have a gentle break between the nearly flat base and the sides. Rims are a simple rounded type. The molcajete's scorings are restricted to the bottom of the interior and do not extend up the sides. They are generally about 1.5 cm. apart and form a repeated diamond design with their crisscrossing pattern. The fourth sherd is from the side of an olla, probably globular in shape with a diameter not over 30 cm. and having a horizontal loop handle attached. The neck is slightly constricted and recurved, and the rim is rounded. The handle is rec- tangular in cross section. Decoration: All are unpainted. The two bowls are gen- erally burnished with a dull luster; however, the molca- jete has a dull burnish restricted to the vessel sides, while the leg and bottomside are smoothed to a uniform mat finish. The leg of one of the bowls is a zoomorphic, stylized head, with "coffeebean" eyes and a pointed snout. This leg and the molcajete leg contain small balls of clay which rattle freely. The olla sherd is uni- formly smoothed but not burnished. Discussion: This type is distinctive from the rest in its unique vessel forms and the brown color of the paste. SUPPORTS Annular supports (10 sherds): In their com- plete state, these supports were probably under 25 cm. in diameter. Their height ranges be- tween 0.6 and 2 cm. One is from a burnished- black molcajete, while two other fragments are of burnished, red-painted molcajetes and a fourth is a burnished, plain buff fragment. Five fragments are from bowls. One is burnished- red, and the others are too eroded for classifi- cation. All fall within the collection's general paste characteristics. Solid bulbar supports (26 sherds, Fig. 5 c-d): These are most characteristically the type of support of the Huistla Polychrome molcajetes. Their lengths are from 3 to 5.5 cm.; their di- ameters are between 2 and 2.5 cm.; and their 75 GLASSOW I</page><page sequence="13">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY bodies either contract to a rounded end or expand to a bulbar end. They are characteris- tically unburnished, and usually there is a blotch of red paint on their upper surfaces. This type of support also occurs with bowls, probably also of the Huistla Polychrome type. Solid contracting supports (9 sherds): The Plain Burnished-black bowls appear to have had, in rare instances, a tripod support of squat, contracting, unburnished legs. These were 2 or 3 cm. in length with diameters averaging 1.5 to 2 cm. Occurring rarely is a buff variety of this contracting type. Solid fiat supports (11 sherds, Fig. 6 y): These are squat, contracting supports 1.5 to 4 cm. in length, 2 to 3.5 cm. in breadth, and 1 to 2.5 cm. in thickness. Seven of the total of 11 are notched regularly along their sides. In all cases one of the flat surfaces was oriented on the vessel so as to face outwards. All are unbur- nished. Four of the notched variety are from Plain Burnished-black bowls. The others are highly eroded but seem to have come from plain bowls. Miscellaneous solid supports (9 sherds): These are untyped, one-of-a-kind specimens or frag- ments too small to assign to a specific category. Some of the smaller fragments may be either a type of nubbin support, lug handles, or nub- bin decorative applique. Hollow zoomorphic supports (3 sherds, Fig. 6 x): All are of molcajetes. They are about 3 cm. long with a canine-appearing face deeply in- cised into the supports' surface. The "chin" of the snout is the base of the supports. Miscellaneous hollow supports (17 sherds): Most of these are assignable to a bulbar type which ranges in size from lengths of about 3 to 5 cm. Seven are burnished-black, but the over- all vessel type of these is unknown. Four others, probably of a similar size range, are buff- colored. Four other plain-surfaced fragments appear to be long contracting legs, possibly of the Plain Brown type. HANDLES Comal loop handles (34 sherds): These are loop handles attached horizontally to the edge of the comal and smoothed so as to grade into the contour of the comal edge. The aperture of the handles is generally round with a diame- ter from 1.2 to 2.5 cm. The thickness of the loop ranges from 1.2 to 1.7 cm. Comal loop handles are, as a rule, unpainted and unbur- nished. Loop handles of unknown vessel types (25 sherds): There are crosscutting ranges in the size of these handles, which consist of lengths from at least 3.5 cm. to more than 7 cm. and diameters from 1 to 2.2 cm. Loop handles with smaller diameters tend to be shorter. NUBBIN APPLIQUE1 All sherds (23) with applique are so small that vessel form cannot be deduced. The nub- bins (one to a sherd except in one case where two are present) range in size from 1 to 2 cm. in breadth and 0.5 to 1.5 cm. in height. Two have a burnished-black surface, two are painted red-orange, and the rest are plain, being buff to brown in color. FIGURINES Hollow type (1 example, Fig. 7 a): The one hollow figurine is very simply made compared to the hollow types known to have been looted from tombs in the Etzatlan area. The body is a hollow cylinder with a flat, solid head attached to the top. Arms are differentiated from the cylindrical body as are feet, but no other bodily details are differentiated. The head has an applique nose, and the circular eyes and rec- tangular mouth are modeled from the head during manufacture. Arms and toes are also applique. The headdress is missing, but hypo- thetically it was a flat continuation of the head. The height (fragmentary) is 12.5 cm., and the diameter of the cylindrical body is 3.5 cm. Mold-made type (1 example, Fig. 7 c): This fragment appears to have been mold-made, but this cannot be unquestionably determined. It is a rectangular fragment of the lower portion of the body consisting of a "skirt" which comes down to the ankles and protruding feet. A tooled band, on which there are faint traces of red ochre, delimits the margin of the skirt. In dimensions, it is 3.7 cm. long, 4.5 cm. wide, and 0.9 cm. thick. Slab type (9 examples, Fig. 7 b): Only the slightest hint of anthropomorphism is evident in this type. The shape is basically a rectangle 4.5 to 6.0 cm. broad, 0.6 to 0.9 cm. thick, and slightly over 10 cm. tall. Notches (ca. 0.7 cm. deep), delimiting the "head," appear opposite 76 [ VOL. 32, No. 1, 1967</page><page sequence="14">CERAMICS OF HUISTLA iU g I SCALE h i FIG. 7. Misc.

In two cases applique nubbins were added to form a "nose." Other bodily features are absent. WHISTLES Only one whistle, (Fig. 7 d-e) either anthro- pomorphic or zoomorphic, is complete enough to discuss. The body is spherical and forms the whistle-chamber. The arms are loops, of which one is complete enough to show that it came down and rested on one of the nubbin legs. The head is broken off at the neck, and the "tail" forms the whistle's mouthpiece. Maximum breadth, at the outstretched legs, is 4.3 cm. Height is over 5.0 cm. STAMP While no stamped pottery was encountered during excavation, a stamp fragment was (Fig. 7 f). From one side to the other, it consists of a line followed by a row of dots, then another line, then repeated pendant elements. Both ends are fragmentary, as is the handle. SPINDLE-WHORLS AND/OR CLAY BEADS All are radially symmetrical with small, cen- tral perforations; however, they can be broken down into several categories based on shape, size, and incised design variation (8 examples, Fig. 7 g-k). Excepting one buff example, all are burnished-black. The buff example is also distinctive in its spool-like shape and lack of any incised decoration (maximum diameter: 1.3 cm., height 1 cm.). A unique, undecorated burnished-black example is biconical, having a maximum diameter of 1.4 cm. and a height from one pointed end to the other of 1.2 cm. These two examples, because of their unique shapes and lack of decoration, may be beads rather than spindle-whorls. The rest of the examples are of a consistent shape, being flat-surfaced with vertical sides. There are two size ranges: the larger consists of two specimens having diameters of 2.2 and 3.1 cm. and heights of 0.8 and 1.0 cm. respectively, and the smaller four have diameters between 1.3 and 1.4 cm. and heights between 0.5 and 0.8 cm. Decoration on these six is of two types. The flat surfaces have either three (one with four) sets of concentric arcs pointing toward the central perforation, or three or four sets of three or four punched dots arranged around the cen- tral perforation. Opposing sides all have the same decoration. One large and two small specimens have the arc decoration and the other two small ones have the dot decoration. The remaining large specimen has a combina- tion of both. CONCLUSIONS Ceramic Stratification at Huistla. Of the ten test pits put into the site, only test pits 1 and 6 encountered midden with appreciable depth; so stratigraphic differences of ceramics, if any, can be based only on these two pits. The other eight pits, while augmenting the sample from Huistla, were too shallow, or, as in the case of pit 9, considerably disturbed. Within the meter or so of deposit from pits 1 and 6, no trends of change in ceramics, even in the types with larger frequencies, are evident from bottom to top of the deposit. From this lack of change, and the comparatively shallow depth of the deposit, it is concluded that the sherd- bearing deposits of Huistla probably represent one cultural component. Augmenting this conclusion are the refuse contents encountered in pit 9. Apparently this test pit cut into a quarter of a refuse pit with fill from a depth of about 60 cm. to a depth of about 120 cm. below the present surface, mounding-over slightly above the 60-cm. depth. Sherd yield was particularly abundant in the contents of this refuse pit (see Table 1). Assum- ing that such refuse would have been accumu- lated over a relatively short period, the sherds found within would be nearly contemporane- ous. Since nearly all of Huistla's types were GLASSOW ] 77</page><page sequence="15">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY represented in the refuse, the whole site prob- ably represents a culturally homogeneous unit. The several rare types not represented in pit 9 may be due to random chance, since they are also scarce elsewhere. Cultural and Temporal Considerations of the Ceramics of Huistla. For many years the Etzat- lan region has been noted for the presence of a shaft-tomb complex, so heavily exploited re- cently by looters and so little understood in terms of its cultural and temporal affiliations. Apparently Corona Nufiez (1954) was the first person to give the Etzatlan shaft-tomb complex professional attention when he reported on one at El Arenal, on the ex-hacienda of San Sebas- tian. Very recently Furst (1965) published an article concerning the radiocarbon dates from a shaft-tomb very near San Sebastian. These three dates, ranging between 127 B.C. ? 100 (UCLA-593A) and A.D. 254?80 (UCLA- 593C) indicate that this complex may extend farther back in time than previously thought by such scholars as Kelly (1948: 69), Lister (1955: 34), and Corona Nunfez (1954: 11). It is not the purpose here to attempt a solu- tion to the temporal problems of the shaft- tomb complex, since Huistla's ceramics bear no relation to the known ceramic types found within these shaft-tombs. Having had the op- portunity to personally examine the vessels interred within the shaft-tomb reported by Furst, I find that the vessels are considerably different from Huistla ceramics, being much thinner-walled, more highly burnished, and in- volving completely different decorative tech- niques and vessel forms. If Huistla ceramics are in fact culturally and temporally separated from those of the shaft- tomb complex, then it is necessary to consider why Huistla is adjacent to a tomb area which still shows evidence of subterranean chambers and their entrance shafts, recently cleaned out by local villagers in their looting activities. Un- fortunately, no ceramics definitely associated with the tombs could be found, and therefore their association or lack of it with Huistla proper could not be ascertained. In light of the above-mentioned knowledge of shaft-tombs in the Etzatlan region, it is highly probable that the shaft-tombs and the midden deposit of Huistla are of two distinct and separated time periods. Huistla ceramics have the strongest similari- ties with wares falling into a series of phases which have partly replaced the older concept of the "Aztatlan" complex. This complex or time horizon, first defined by Sauer and Brand (1932) as a culture area, was based on a series of surface collections from sites in the Sinaloa coastal lowlands. Later, with more data at hand from excavated sites, Kelly redefined the Aztat- lan complex, and finally Kelley and Winters (1960), using data from Durango excavations, abandoned the concept altogether and replaced the complex or horizon with three phases: the Lolandis, Acaponeta, and Guasave phases. Grosscup (1964: 207), in his analysis of Amapa ceramics, essentially follows Kelley and Win- ters, except that he places the Guasave phase somewhat earlier and gives local phase names for Amapa. Table 3 summarizes the recent work of Kelley and Winters (1960) and Gross- cup (1964) in defining phases falling within the time span of the older concept of the Aztat- lan complex. Similarities between ceramic types or wares, both in this paper and in other published litera- ture, are mainly based on stylistic similarities of design with other ceramic attributes given secondary attention. In defining the Aztatlan complex, and later in defining a series of local phases to replace the Aztatlan complex, stylistic similarities of certain red-on-buff wares or types have played an important part. Almost in- variably, these wares or types will have a red rim, followed either on the interior or the exterior by a band several centimeters thick bordered by red lines, usually containing re- peated geometric or curvilinear motifs. These motifs may be scrolls, steps, checkerboard pat- terns, series of vertical lines, and a variety of others. Below this band of repeated motifs, there are often scallops or other radially sym- metrical motifs. Named types or wares fitting stylistically into this description begin with Sauer and Brand's (1932: 63) Decorated Red-rimmed Red-on-buff. The Guasave area of northern Sinaloa has pro- duced a type, Guasave Red-on-buff (Ekholm 1942: 46), which is very similar to Red-rim Decorated reported by Kelly (1945b: 25) from the sites of Culiacain and Chametla (Kelly 1938: 18). Ekholm (1942: 48) refers to these two types, as well as Sauer and Brand's Plain and Decorated Red-rimmed Red-on-buff, as Sinaloa Red-on-buff, even though there is some distinctiveness from one site to another.

Also to be included is Gifford's (1950: 227) Red-on-buff ware of his Middle period from the Ixtlan del Rio region of southern Nayarit. Fay (1959) suggests the term Tecuala Red-on-buff to refer to all the closely similar Nayarit and Sinaloa types, and more recently Kelley and Winters (1960: 551) suggest that the term Lolandis Red-rim Ware refer to the Culiacan and Chametla red-on-buff types and that Guasave Red-on-buff, which they believe to be a later and more elaborate type, be retained separate from Lolandis Red- rim Ware. They place the former into the Guasave phase and the latter into the Lolandis phase. Table 4 depicts the relationship of the nomenclature referring to the red-on-buff types mentioned above. This welter of nomenclature obviously over- laps to some extent. It seems evident that each of these reported sites has variations of the same general ceramic category, but at present it is not possible to ascertain degrees of variance be- tween one local type and another, much less to relate these in any precise manner to Huistla Acueducto Red-on-buff. Nevertheless, Huistla Acueducto Red-on-buff is surely much more divergent from the Sinaloa-Nayarit types or wares than these are among themselves. In con- trast to the Nayarit-Sinaloa types, the decora- tion of Huistla is almost exclusively on open, relatively shallow bowl interiors with only a moderate burnish. Only one Huistla sherd, possibly of foreign manufacture, fits into the Nayarit-Sinaloa descriptions reasonably closely (Fig. 5 e) in that it is burnished with exterior decoration on a vertical-sided bowl and with an encircling groove just below the rim. But in spite of the divergent qualities of Huistla's Acueducto Red-on-buff, it does correlate close- ly in decorative content with the Nayarit-Sina- loa red-on-buffs, although the decorations of Huistla are not as elaborate. Huistla Engraved Burnished-black also shows strong stylistic resemblances with some en- graved or incised ceramics of the same local phases (or Aztatlan complex) for which simi- larities of red-on-buff ceramics were noted. These types again have a panelled band of re- peated motifs running along the circumference of bowls. Motifs are about the same as those occurring on the red-on-buff types. Sauer and Brand's (1932: 63) Fine Incised, Southern seems particularly close; Ekholm's (1942: 56) Cerro Isabel Engraved of Guasave, although more elaborate, shared similar treatment and similar motifs in the engraving; Grosscup's (1964: 162, and personal observation) Tuxpan Engraved of Amapa's Tuxpan phase and later, contains examples which are nearly indistin- guishable in design style and vessel form, and Mangos Engraved of the Cerritos phase from the same site is also nearly identical except for the presence of a red rim (Grosscup 1964: 146). Both types have fugitive pigments rubbed into their engraving as does that of Huistla, although red, white, and blue pigments are used in Amapa types whereas only red is used in the Huistla type. Of Gifford's (1950: 225) category "Incised ware" for which he mentions "Aztat- lan" affinities, the black ware is in part similar, as is the plain red terra cotta which could be an oxidized deviation from the black ware. On a more general level of comparison, Huistla Engraved Burnished-black can be com- pared with several more elaborately engraved or incised types which often have the addition of a painted decoration. Resemblances in de- sign pattern (sub-rim band of repeated parallel motifs) exist with Aztatldn Ware, as described by Kelly (1945b: 28) for Guasave; and Bota- dero Incised described by Grosscup (1964: 121) for Amapa's Cerritos phase, when the incised 1200 - 1000 - 800 - Cojumatlan Cojumatlan GLASSOW ] 79</page><page sequence="17">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY TABLE 4.

Representative of both complexes at the Cojumatlan site, the type Zapotldn Gray Incised is similar only in that it is gray with an incised geometric decoration (Lister 1949: 49). Motifs and vessel form do not correlate with Huistla Incised Burnished-black. Huistla Incised Polychrome has fewer close analogies to other west Mexican types than do the two Huistla types mentioned above. Sauer and Brand (1932: 39, Fig. 13 c) illustrate a sherd from the site of San Felipe, just north of the Rio Santiago in central Nayarit, which, al- though stylistically more elaborate, nearly fits the description of Huistla Incised Polychrome. Gifford's (1950: 225) Ixtl'an del Rio surveys yielded a few sherds which may be identical. Under his category "Incised Ware," he men- tions Red-on-buff, biface painted sherds which could very easily be surface-eroded examples of Huistla Incised Polychrome. The technique of using incision to demarcate zones of color in elaborate design patterns seems to be present during similar time periods; however, the motifs and design patterns vary considerably in rela- tion, say, to those of the above-mentioned Nayarit-Sinaloa red-on-buff types. Within Amapa's Cerritos phase, Botadero Incised and, to a greater extent, Cerritos Polychrome (Gross- cup 1964: 121, 128) use incision-bordered zones of color, but stylistically they are quite different from the Incised Polychrome of Huistla. At least part of Cojumatlan Incised Polychrome, placed by Lister (1949: 26) within the Coju- matlan complex, uses the same technique. The White and Brown-on-orange of Huistla shows some similarities to lago Polychrome of Amapa's Cerritos phase (Grosscup 1964: 133) and to a portion of Polychrome Wares of Ixt- lan del Rio (Gifford 1950: 266, Fig. 16 s), all three having as one of the motifs broad brown bands bordered by thin white lines. A similarity which seems to crosscut com- monly accepted time horizons is that of Huistla White-on-red with a series of other white-on- red types generally believed to be associated with the period following what has been tradi- tionally called Aztatlan. Santiago White-on- red, as described and illustrated by Grosscup (1964: 158) as a Santiago phase type of Amapa, is similar in the use of thin white lines being composed into relatively elaborate motifs, in- cluding extensive use of hachuring. But the motifs on the whole are not too similar. This Amapa type is very similar to Autldn White- on-red which is dated by Kelly (1945a: 41) within the same time period as Amapa's San- tiago phase and therefore lies in the same rela- tion to the White-on-red of Huistla. Whether these analogies of the late white-on-red types to the Huistla type really are valid cannot be stated with full confidence, since the more cur- vilinear motifs of Huistla contrast with the more rectilinear motifs of Santiago and Autlan White-on-red. Miniature Vessels of Huistla afford another medium of comparison. Lister (1955: 18) cites the occurrence of miniature ollas from along the northwest shores of Lake Chapala without a site context. Both Lister (1955: 18) and Lumholtz (1902: 463) suggest that these were votive offerings. This is congruent with findings of the activities of the Etzatlan Project and further, it is possible that both the Lake Chapala and Etzatlan occurrences are related culturally and temporally. Aside from similarities between specific ce- ramic types, there are a few traits found cross- cutting a number of Huistla types and those from other west Mexican sites. Already men- tioned in the type comparisons above is a styl- istic pattern, that of a panelled band encircling vessels, usually bowls, near their rims. The repeated motifs in this band, both at Huistla and at other sites, often consist of a series of circles with central dots or of a scroll design, each repeat divided from the previous one by horizontal or diagonal lines. Types at Huistla which display this pattern are Acueducto Red- on-buff (Fig. 5 e-g) and the Engraved Bur- nished-black (Fig. 5 u-v). At other west Mexi- can sites, red-on-buff types and engraved or incised types assigned to similar periods often exhibit this decorative pattern, specifically those types to which analogies to Huistla types have already been indicated above. Lister (1949: 29) sees this particular pattern as linking the Cojumatlan material of Lake Chapala with more northerly Aztatlan assemblages, and Ek- 80 [ VOL. 32, No. 1, 1967</page><page sequence="18">CERAMICS OF HUISTLA holm (1942: 48) also makes incidental note of the spiral motif repeated in decorative bands, which is very prevalent on several of the in- cised and painted types from his Guasave exca- vations, such as Guasave Red-on-buff (Ekholm 1942, Fig. 3), Aztatldn Polychrome (Ekholm 1942, Fig. 4), and Cerro Isabel Engraved (Ek- holm 1942, Fig. 6). Another decorative motif found on west Mexican types is a brown or black line overlain by a row of white dots. Huistla White and Brown-on-orange, White and Brown-on-red, and Polychrome-on-red types all have this motif. Several of Ekholm's Guasave types, Guasave Polychrome (1942, Fig. 9) as an exam- ple, exhibit this motif, and Ekholm (1942: 125) postulates that it is derived from an Early Chametla pattern which persisted into Aztat- lafn times at Guasave. Zoomorphic effigy legs, very similar to Huistla Hollow Zoomorphic type, were found by Lister (1949: 21) at Cojumatlan. He believes they are mold-made, as indeed Huistla's examples may be also, but they are too eroded to be cer- tain. Huistla figurines, even though they are essen- tially unique, do bear general resemblances to types in association with many of the west Mexican ceramic types mentioned above. Of the Amapa figurine types reported by Grosscup (1961: 395), Type L may be a considerably more elaborate version of Huistla's Slab type. The body shape is identical to that of Huistla, having the same basically rectangular outline with notches differentiating the head from the shoulders and a deep basal notch dividing the two legs from each other. Both apparently have a simple protruding nose; however the Amapa type has added such other applique bodily features as eyes, mouth, and rudimentary arms, thus making it quite different from the Huistla type. Grosscup believes this type is possibly late within the Late period of the Amapa sequence. Huistla may also have a mold-made figurine represented in its assemblage, but this is some- what difficult to tell due to the smallness of the fragment. If it is mold-made, it has an applique element added. Mold-made figurines so far found in west Mexico have a strong re- semblance to the Mazapan type of the Valley of Mexico. Both Grosscup (1961: 391) and Lister (1949: 60) report mold-made figurines from Amapa and Cojumatlan respectively. Lis- ter (1949: 60) found this type associated with Toltec and post-Toltec (post-Aztatlan) period deposits at Cojumatlafn. Kelly reports on mis- cellaneous mold-made figurines from Apatzin- gan in central Michoacan, of which several look definitely Mazapan, and Kelly (1947: 109) be- lieves these to be associated with the Chila phase of Apatzing'an which is post-Toltec in time. In spite of these late occurrences both Lister (1955: 56) and Grosscup (1961: 402) feel that the type is basically characteristic of a period contemporaneous with the Valley of Mexico's Toltec horizon. The type may also be represented in Gifford's (1950: 233) Ixtlan material under the category of "plaque," which "looks almost as though it had been made with a roller stamp ..." The solitary hollow figurine in the Huistla assemblage is rather anomalous. Hollow figur- ines are supposed to be of a much earlier hori- zon in west Mexican prehistory (Kelly 1948: 66; Furst 1965: 612), but aside from the fact that the Huistla example is hollow, there is no similarity to the well-known Colima, Jalisco, or Nayarit types. An attribute with possible affini- ties with another figurine type in west Mexico is the apparent headdress on the Huistla exam- ple which, although fragmentary, definitely came down to its shoulders. Such a trait is distinctly characteristic of the Mazapan mold- made type mentioned previously. Such a com- parison is obviously very tenuous, however, and is only offered as an impression which should be considered when more is known about west Mexican figurines. Spindle whorls from Huistla are stylistically simple compared to others reported from west Mexican sites. The Ixtlan sites yielded a type which has a nearly identical shape and incised decoration (a series of grouped concentric arcs), but Ixtlan examples also have a decorated cir- cumference, as opposed to the plain circumfer- ence of Huistla. A similar comparison can be made with spindle whorls from Cohumatlan Jalisco, where again circumferences are deco- rated (Lister 1949: 63). Examples from Autlan, Jalisco (Kelly 1945a: 72), and Apatzingan, Michoacain (Kelly 1947: 113), have the same arc pattern with decorated sides. While Huistla and probably Ixtlain and Apatzingain examples are earlier, Autlan examples are later, and therefore, at least presently, this type of spindle whorl does not serve as a sensitive time-marker. This follows Lister's (1955: 38) analysis in GLASSOW ] 81</page><page sequence="19">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY which spindle whorls in general did not yield satisfactory results in indicating horizons. SUMMARY AND INFERENCES From the above discussion, it is clear that the ceramics of Huistla are most similar to types or wares placed within the so-called Aztatlan complex of Kelly (1938, 1945b) or the tem- porally analogous local phases of Kelley and Winters (1960) and Grosscup (1964). The most striking similarities exist in particular de- sign styles held in common by certain lowland types and Huistla Acueducto Red-on-buff and Engraved Burnished-black, the latter being nearly identical to Amapa's Tuxpan Engraved. Yet except for this close analogy to a type at Amapa, the ceramics of Huistla do not compare as closely to types in the coastal lowlands as these do among themselves. Similarities to the ceramics of close-by Ixtlan del Rio are probably considerable, but the low numbers and smallness of sherd size from Gif- ford's surface collections make comparisons difficult. The only similarity which is anomalous in temporal relationship is Huistla White-on-red with comparatively late types. No ready ex- planation of this can be given other than this may only be a superficial resemblance to two unrelated types. Since the greatest number of similarities of Huistla ceramics are with those of the Cerritos phase at Amapa and probably the Middle Ixt- lan phase of Ixtlan del Rio, it is suggested that Huistla's occupation was essentially contempo- raneous with these phases. The relationship of Huistla to the Sinaloa materials is more dis- tant, particularly with the very elaborate Gua- save ceramics. But since Huistla ceramics have some fairly specific stylistic similarities with Guasave's ceramics, even though the types are not analogous, I would tend to follow Grosscup (1964: 207) in seeing the Guasave phase as closer in time to the Cerritos and Middle Ixtlan phases than Kelley and Winters suggest. Kelley and Winters (1960: 557) also sug- gest that copper artifacts did not reach coastal Sinaloa until after the Aztatlan manifestations at Chametla and Culiacain. Grosscup (1964: 206) argues, however, that copper could have been present during these earlier times (the Cerritos phase) but only in very sparing quan- tities. This is supported at Huistla, where the several copper artifacts were found only in the rich deposit of the refuse encountered in test pit 9. In addition, similarities exist with the sup- posedly earlier red-on-buff ceramics called Lolandis Red-rim Ware by Kelley and Winters (1960). It therefore cannot be stated with full assurance that Huistla ceramics fall within the specific period of the Cerritos and Guasave phases, dated by Grosscup (1964: 242-3) be- tween A.D. 900 and 1250. The Aztatlan complex or horizon, which has been strongly attacked by Kelley and Winters (1960) and questioned by Grosscup (1964: 203), still seems to have some validity in a stylistic sense. It is clear from the analyses of Kelley and Winters and Grosscup that tem- poral subdivisions are justified on typological grounds; however, it is also clear from the analysis presented in this paper that there are stylistic similarities which crosscut certain types of those subdivisions, particularly in reference to the previously mentioned west Mexican red- on-buff types or wares. Temporal divisions in which these occur are the Middle period of Ixtlan del Rio, the Tuxpan and Cerritos phases of Amapa, the Aztatl'an complex (or the Loan- dis and Acaponeta phases) of Chametla and Culiacfan, and the Guasave phase of Guasave (see Table 3). The Aztatlan complex or hori- zon, if it is to be retained as a useful concept, may eventually refer to a series of horizon styles falling within a time period from A.D. 800 or somewhat earlier to about A.D. 1200. It would be wise, however, to reserve decision on this matter until the time when considerably more data are available concerning the cultural his- tory of this particular period in west Mexico. Distinctiveness in a comparative sense seems to be one of the major characteristics of Huistla ceramics. Where similarities do occur, they are of a relatively simplified character. Huistla Polychrome seems to be wholly unique, as are probably the flanged rim forms and the molca- jete form. Such distinctiveness could be a re- sult of geographic isolation from a contempo- raneous efflorescence along the coastal lowlands, Huistla being on the periphery of this coastal focus. By the time influences reached Huistla, they had been simplified, having lost much of the elaboration which typifies the contempo- raneous coastal ceramics, and other traits were allowed to develop along individualistic lines. 82 [ VOL. 32, No. 1, 1967</page><page sequence="20">CERAMICS OF HUISTLA This view of diffusion from the coast is at odds with Lister's (1955: 56) suggestion that Ixtlan del Rio and Cojumatlfan represent points along a path of northwesterly trait diffusion from central Mexico. Cojumatlan, on Lake Chapala, could easily have been one of these points, as could also Ixtlan del Rio if more detailed information were available, but a hy- pothesis of diffusion southwards from Sinaloa seems just as tenable, and seems probable in the case of Huistla.
