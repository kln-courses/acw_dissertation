RAHMANI Department of Antiquities In June 1962 the Department of Antiquities was informed about the acciden tal discovery of an ancient tomb near Kfar Dikhrin.1 The tomb was survey ed, and the finds transferred to the Department of Antiquities in Jerusalem.2 They will be described below, with special emphasis on the pottery plaques which form the main subject of this paper. Kfar Dikhrin (Zikrin)3 is located some 7.5 km. north-west of Beth Govrin. The tomb was discovered east of the village. Its entrance had been destroyed, but the two burial chambers were found intact. Both were barrel-vaulted, holding two trough-shaped graves, their head-ends somewhat elevated; they were separated by broad shelves (Fig. l). The burial places contained a large quantity of human bones, whose brittle condition made transfer and iden tification impossible. The finds were discovered in one group on the shelf between burial places III and IV, at their head-ends. THE FINDS Metal.

In the centre, the plaque has a round depression with a raised edge. This depression holds a some what convex piece of blown glass, backed by a thin layer of lead, now mostly decomposed, and surrounded by a thin gold border.21 The glass is held in place by a rather clumsy frame of plaster, which overlaps the slightly recessed edge; there are some small holes in this frame. The plaque is pierced ; its back is flat and undecorated. Similar plaques of pottery, soft limestone, or plaster have been found in different places in this country, all in late Roman or Byzantine contexts. A circular plaque, almost identical with our example, was found in the above mentioned tomb 242 at Gezer,22 and similar circular plaques were found at Ni?ana (Auja el-Hafir)23 and in cave 34 at Bethany, which contained finds of the Byzantine to Early Arab periods.24 Somewhat similar plaques (sometimes erroneously described as bread stamps) come from a tomb at el-Bassa, dated to the end of the fourth century,25 and from Horns.26 An additional example, of unknown provenance, is in the Palestine Archaeological Museum,27 while others, supposed to come from Beth Govrin, were published by Moulton.28 Some of these are completely undecorated, but have up to five depressions fcr 29 glass insets.

RAHMANI e) similar, but with additional birds and seven-branched candlestick(s). Variations show three or more mirrors (Fig. 4:5).44 The interpretations of these plaques have so far dealt with some of the groups here mentioned, generally disregarding the others. The explanations given, while fitting one type, would therefore not fit the other types. Cr?, who was the first to bring these plaques to the attention of the public,45 wished to interpret the cock as a peacock, symbolic of the resurrection, and thus saw in the glass disk a receptacle for the Eucharist, which was deposited with the dead. Macalister,46 citing Cr?, explained his plaque outright as a 'pottery pyx for reception of a crumb of Eucharistie bread'; Moulton,47 following suit, was however at some pains to explain this theory in the light of the discovery of female figurines holding similar disks ? especially as these figurines reminded him of Astarte. Ronzevalle48 was the first to recognize that the glass disks were simple convex mirrors lined with lead, citing as his main authorities Kisa49 and Michon.50 He emphasized the 'Astarte' nature of some of these plaques, but thought that most of them were nothing but children's toys. He failed, however, to explain why these small mirrors were often given such a peculiar frame. Mayer and Reifenberg saw in them, probably quite rightly, representations of the Torah-shrine. Moreover, they interpreted these plaques as a 'prototype of the mizrah pictures'51 (i. e. showing the direction of prayer). Jonas52 evidently accepted this view. While this explanation disregards the different types of plaques and also fails to account for the presence of the mirrors, Goodenough53 tries to circumvent this difficulty by emphasizing that the different forms might indicate different uses. He sees in the glasses or mirrors some sort of symbol of mystic light and eternal life, because they appear here in place of the rosette, which in his opinion serve?invariably as a symbol of this mystic light. Citing two plaques somewhat similar to those published by Mayer and Reifenberg,54 44 L. A. Mayer and A. Reifenberg: PEFQSt 70 (1937), Pl. VII: 1-3; Goodenough, op. di. (above, 42), Nos. 440-442.

This theory, taking much for granted, fails, however, to explain the many undecorated or sparsely decorated plaques, nor does it deal with the question of the suspension hole, which a mere deposition near the buried body made absolutely superfluous. Sailer,55 reconsidering all previous views including the possibility that they were 'burial plaques', rejects them all. He also denies the possibility of their being mirrors, as they are, in his opinion, much too small for that use. Finally, Dunscombe Colt calls them mirrors, without entering into any further discussion.56 Trying now to find an interpretation which might fit all the types of plaques here described, we should take into consideration the fact that each type has one or more small mirrors as an inset. It should be emphasized that these are indeed mirrors, lined with lead. That this is so was not only recognized by Ronzevalle, but was proved by the analysis made at the Hebrew University. As to their size, it should be pointed out that small Roman mirrors of 5 cm. diameter are no rarity.57True, the mirrors on these plaques havea diameter of not more than 3.5 cm. and are often even smaller, especially in the specimens which have a number of mirrors; such a small size seems indeed too tiny for any practical, everyday use. One is thus forced to look for some kind of symbolic, ceremonial, or magical use of mirrors, which may have been, in the fifth century, acceptable to the three main religions. Jewish use is indicated by plaques decorated with the seven-branched candlestick; the plaques in the form of a female figure, with or without a small shrine, point to use by pagans ; Christian use, finally, seems indicated by the cock and, still more so, the fish, but in any case by recurring instances of such plaques being found in tombs together with small cross-pendants. The only common motif coming to mind seems to be the apotropaic use of mirrors. In different p^rts of Europe, North Africa, and China, small mirrors were fastened to the cradle to protect the child, to one's own body as personal protection, or near the bed as protection against evil spirits.58 The idea behind this practice was simply that any possible evil, inherent in M Cf. loe at.

It therefore seems permissible to apply this motif in our case as well: we thus see in these mirror-plaques charms against the evil eye, which had served their owners in life and were placed into their tombs with some hope that they might here, too, prove effective against the perils of afterlife. w This expression was first suggested by Seligmann, ibid., I, Berlin, 1910, pp. 178-182, where full documentation is given. w Cf. the story of Narcissus (Ovid, Metamorphoses, III, 339; Pausanias IX, 31:6; and Plutarch, Symposiac Questions, 7) ; see also Papyrus Paris 2298 (C.
