LVI/2 The Representation and Reality of Religion in Dance Judith Lynne Hanna A SYSTEM OF PALPABLE, vital signs, dance is a barometer of theol- ogy, ideology, world view, and social change. Yet dance does not figure prominently in religious studies or other nondance scholarly disciplines. Words take pride of place over kinetic images. Although there are established traditions for the study of texts, nonverbal communication, sociolinguistic, and semiotic studies developed only after World War II, and perspectives from these fields have only more recently been applied to dance (Hanna, 1979, 1987a, 1987b, 1988a, 1988b). This article explores the relationship of dance to divinity,' and aims to call attention to a neglected form of expression in the comparative and critical exami- nation of religion. It offers, from the ethnographic/historical record, an analytical typology of some of the ways in which dancers and spectators draw the power of the supernatural to the human world and reach out to the holy. CONCEPTS A religion's position on two issues affects its use of images of the divine in dance (cf. Wach, 1958). First, is the deity knowable in bodily form? If the answer is affirmative, then it is likely that a dancer, creating specific images in space, time, and with effort, can temporarily meta- morphose into a god or subtle suggestions or attributes of an awesome Judith Lynne Hanna is Senior Research Scholar, College of Human Ecology, University of Mary- land, College Park, MD 20742. 1 This article is a revised version of papers presented at the New Ecumenical Research Association Conference on God: The Contemporary Discussion, August 10-15, 1984, held in Seoul, and the Eastern Society for Aesthetics, March 22, 1986, held at George Mason University. I wish to thank Betty Rubenstein for the opportunity to learn more about art and religion; Doug Adams, Diane Apostolos-Cappadona, Alf Hiltebeitel, and William Murray for directing me to relevant literature; and Jean Cunningham, William John Hanna, Lois Ibsen al Faruqi, Lauri Honko, Doug Adams, Brenda Dixon-Stowell, and Sally Ann Ness, for their helpful comments on earlier drafts of this article. 281</page><page sequence="2">282 Journal of the American Academy of Religion numinous reality. Among the polytheistic religions of the Greeks, Romans, Hindus, and Africans, participants tend to think that the gods possess anthropomorphic attributes and are subject to the same weak- nesses that plague humans.2 Thus, these religions have a tendency to present static or kinetic (danced) images of the divine. However, if one's god is considered to have a hidden face, a con- sciousness unlike our own, and an inscrutable aim, then, at most, dance is likely to manifest only essences of divinity. Some congregations rooted in the Judeo-Christian tradition follow the biblical injunction of not making any graven image of God (Exodus, 20:4-5). Similarly, Islam has canonical prohibitions against human-made imagery of God and perceives idolatry/iconolatry sinful, including the three-dimensional images of dance (al Faruqi, 1984). The absence of visible representation of divinity in dance often symbolizes the invisible transcendence of a god.3 Second, a religion's attitude toward the body, especially emotionality and sexuality, affects its use of dance in religion and other aspects of life (see Wilson, 1982:65). Consider the contrasting attitudes toward the body generally found in Christianity and Hinduism. Viewing the human body as a temple housing the Holy Spirit and calling its church the "body of Christ," Christianity's attitude toward the body is inconsistent but generally neg- ative. In earliest Christianity, dance flourished among some gnostic groups and more recently among the Shakers, whose dances were sup- posed to shake off evils associated with the flesh. Although early Chris- tians described dance as an imitation of the perpetual dance of the angels (training to enable one to enter heaven) and built upon the Hebrew tradition of demonstrating through pious dance that no part of 2Polytheistic faiths may have supreme gods who have unknowable forms or are known only through incarnations. Some polytheistic religious groups with bodily religious behavior, following the universal human practice of creating signs to distinguish between and among people and to rally their followers, reject danced images of divinity to set themselves apart from competing reli- gions that accept them. 3The position of the unknowability of the Hebrew, Christian, and Moslem gods has been chal- lenged. Bennett (1976:3) speaks of the "putative theology of non-human deity issued in distinct but radically related Hebraic, Christian, and Moslem forms as the most insistent anthropomorphism the world has ever known, in willful Jehovah. .., in crusading Allah, and in the Father of a given man in history." He raises "serious doubt in regard to clarity and honesty in the contemporary apprecia- tion of the history of religion, as it applies to Greek anthropomorphism versus the unknown Chris- tian God, when the first sees god in man but never man as god, and the second can posit unknown and unknowable deity in the unique genetic relation of Father to Son." Nevertheless, the wide- spread acceptance of belief in the unknowability of the Hebrew, Christian, and Moslem gods affects the representation and reality of divinity in dance.</page><page sequence="3">Hanna: Divinity in Dance 283 the individual was unaffected by the love of God, Christians have also scorned flesh as the root of all evil to be transcended, even mortified. A popular misunderstanding of St. Paul's view of flesh--by which he meant the individual acting selfishly-led to negative attitudes and actions toward the body that he did not share; he proclaimed, "Glorify Christ in your bodies" (Adams, 1980, 1984). Rejection of the body also reflected an inability to come to terms with aging and death. Unre- strained, sensual, and frenzied movements in religious dance, perceived as a debasement of religion, catalyzed periodic proscriptions of dance and penalties against dancers. Preachers of the ideal of the virgin and ascetics who disdained eroticism and joyous emotional expression feared dance would undermine faith and unsettle the hierarchic status quo. However, even when proscribed or out-of-style, dance historically reemerges in new transformations. For example, the Sacred Dance Guild members introduce dance into Christian church services (Taylor, 1967), how-to handbooks proliferate (e.g., Rock, 1978; Gagne, et al. 1984; and Davies, 1984); and courses on the process and meaning of dance in religion appear (e.g., at The Pacific School of Religion and The Graduate Theological Union). Unlike Christianity, a prevalent strand of Hinduism (in contrast with the minority ascetic strand) merges the sacred and erotic in a felicitous union. Rather than considering carnal love a phenomenon to be "over- come," as in some Christian denominations, this form of Hinduism embraces sexual congress as symbolic of the desired absolute union with divinity. Many Hindu dances convey this microcosm of a divine crea- tion that reveals the hidden truth of the universe through telling stories about the anthropomorphic gods. The supreme all-powerful god is manifest through Brahma, Vishnu (who appears in the incarnation of Rama or Lord Krishna of amorous nature and exploits), and Shiva (Lord of the Dance who created the universe with its destruction and regeneration through dance). The clas- sic and sacred treatise Natyasastra describes dance as an offering and demonstration of love to God, a cleansing of sin, a devotional submis- sion, a partaking of the cosmic control of the world, and expression of God within. As in Christian countries, corrupted dance in India was stamped out. The impact of the Moslem and later British rule undermined the economic strength of the patrons of the Hindu temple dancers, whose consequent need to earn their livelihood forced them into secular</page><page sequence="4">284 Journal of the American Academy of Religion entertainment, including prostitution. Transformed dance genres later emerge (Hanna, 1988a, forthcoming). What characteristics of dance make it an attractive religious behav- ior? Sometimes "dance" is used metaphorically and broadly as in the "dance" of the priest, which describes the Mass as "a kind of religious symbolic dance" that uses twisting, turning, bobbing, bowing, and hand gestures (Knox, 1948:3, 13, 26, 37, 60, 65, 110). Herein, dance refers to human behavior composed of purposeful-from the dancer's perspec- tive-intentionally rhythmical, and culturally patterned sequences of nonverbal body movements other than ordinary motor activities. The movements have inherent and "aesthetic" values, meaning notions of appropriateness and competency. (This conceptualization of dance is elaborated in Hanna, 1987b, 1983b.) Danced forms of imaging the divine, including frenzied and seemingly spontaneous movements found in possession dances, are culturally patterned, whether through tutorial instruction, schooling, or watching performers. Current knowledge about dance suggests why traditions that espouse the knowability of a god and accept bodily-oriented religious practice, or traditions that espouse the unknowability of God and reject images yet accept the bodily expression of essences, draw upon dance for manifes- tations of divinity. The intertwining of mind and body, and cognition and emotion, account for the power of dance (Hanna, 1983b). Whereas various arts use the body as an accessory to create sounds or visual objects, dance uses the body's primal energy directly and evokes bodily associations: life is bodily motion. Dance is multisensory (the sight of performers moving in time and space with effort, the sounds of physical movements, the odors of physi- cal exertion, the feeling of kinesthetic activity or empathy, the touch of body to body and/or performing area, and the proxemic sense); dance is also language-like. Like poetry, it has suggestive imagery, rhythm, ambiguity, multiple meanings, and latitude in form. As in verbal lan- guage (with its words, sentences, paragraphs, and sociocultural context that determines their use), dance has situationally-determined move- ment-vocabulary, steps, and phrases-which may comprise realistic or abstract symbols, project experience beyond the dancer's own, and transform feeling and thought. Intense, vigorous dancing can lead to an altered state of conscious- ness through brain wave frequency, adrenalin, and blood sugar changes. These actions provide a fatigue that abates rage or alleviates depression. Rapid motion may induce catharsis and turning, a state of vertigo. Dance-induced altered states of consciousness may be perceived as</page><page sequence="5">Hanna: Divinity in Dance 285 numinous. The ephemerality and the extraordinary, arresting qualities of dance, and sometimes the special training of the performer, also may contribute a supernatural aura. Because motion attracts attention and dance is cognitive and mul- tisensory, dance has the unique potential of going beyond other arts and audio-visual media in framing, prolonging, or discontinuing communi- cation and in creating moods, a sense of situation, and a divine manifes- tation. Moreover, dance is often accompanied by music, song, and poetry, and the dancer is frequently dramatically costumed and may carry symbolic objects. (Cf. de Rougemont, 1964:62-3.) Religions encompass the symbolism of dance. Meaning in dance forms is encoded and conveyed through different devices and spheres, used singly or in combinations (see the grid, Hanna, 1979, 1978b). The device of metaphor is a dance in place of another kind of expression that it resembles to suggest a likeness between the two. An instance is the appearance through dance of a particular deity known for contentious- ness as a comment on a family social dispute. A metonym is a dance that represents a larger whole of which it is part or with which it is associ- ated in the same frame of experience. A dance as a simile to God's creation of the world, or a manifestation of God when the divine is rec- ognized in all that lives, is illustrative. A concretization is mimetic pres- entation, such as enacting through dance the anthropomorphic antics of a god hunting. Stylization refers to somewhat arbitrary religious gestures or movements that are the result of convention. An icon is a dancer portraying most of a deity's properties or characteristics and being treated as the god. Dance conveys meaning through such spheres as the event of the dance or ritual of which it is part, the body itself being highlighted through dance, the impact of the whole performance, performance seg- ments as they unfold as in a story, specific movements or style that reflect religious values, the intermesh of dance with other communica- tion modes such as song or dance as a vehicle for it, and presence (cha- risma, energy). In manifesting divinity, dance may be both a means and an end; it may also be (exist unto itself ) and mean (refer symbolically to something beyond itself). Dance may be a medium to reach such a goal as inviting a deity to possess the performer, detaching the individual from the earth to become united with God, or acknowledging that a deity is a reflection of one's own mind. Besides dancing to affect a transformation, dancing may be an end in itself; the moving performer may be the host a deity selects for its manifestation. In yet another pattern, a dancer may</page><page sequence="6">286 Journal of the American Academy of Religion become a deity temporarily through initiation or consecration. Several functions may occur in a dance performance that shape images of divin- ity: a dancer may induce possession through a specific dance, perform particular movements that identify the sacred, symbolize social conflict, or catalyze remediation. CATEGORIES OF DANCED IMAGES OF THE DIVINE Within a theory of dance as nonverbal communication (with devices and spheres of encoding meaning), there are five provisional broad cate- gories of danced images of the divine. The categories are distinguished by the process by which images are created, the degree to which images of the divine and the supernatural are believed to be coterminous, the extent to which the sacred and profane overlap, the goal of the dance, the amount of prescription for presenting images, and the relative age of the dance. Because the literature on these kinds of dances varies widely in richness, the discussion of each category is also uneven. Embodying the Supernatural: Inner Transformation A devotee possessed by a supernatural entity crosses the threshold into another state of being. Possession is concretely manifested through specific, identifiable dance patterns. Dancers may further prove the validity of their divine visitation by the kinds of acts Foley observed in West Java: playing with fire, walking on blazing coals, rolling torches over their bodies, eating light bulbs, dousing themselves with boiling water, and piercing themselves with swords (1985). Believers say that these various movements signify that the deity or spiritual being is pres- ent and is enacting its particular role. Fears of the supernatural entity's indifference are put to rest. Adherents of numerous African religions and their manifold offshoots in, for example, Haitian vodoun and Brazil- ian macumba, as well as religions in North and South America, Europe, and Asia, believe that humans can contact and/or become deities and influence them to act on a person's or group's behalf. Priests or laype- ople may become possessed (cf. Adams, 1984:312-14). Invited Possession. Possession dance is consistent with what is a commonly held African view of the gods: "beings that do themselves act dramatically. . . .The drama of worship therefore, is, in effect, an elaboration of the dramatic implications of the behaviour associated with the gods. It is an attempt to provide a convenient medium by means of which men, taking the initiative, can meet their gods"</page><page sequence="7">Hanna: Divinity in Dance 287 (Nketia:4). The worshipper lends his or her body to the tutelary spirit when the supernatural wishes to communicate with the living or when the devotee desires to meet and consult with it. Possession is induced through devout belief, auto-suggestion, auto-intoxication, vertigo (ver- tigo is usually caused by frenzied, specific, persistent, and increasingly rapid, rapturous movement), recognizable musical accompaniment, audience encouragement, and sometimes also drugs. Nketia's comments on the relationship between possession and music and dancing in his country of Ghana apparently apply widely: "It is believed that the state of ecstasy or of possession can be quickly induced and sustained by means of special music closely correlated with specific forms of bodily action. . . .also that the gods are sensitive to this music. Opportunities are, therefore, sought to call to them while the dancing is going on, in the hope that they will 'possess' the dancers as they are emotionally prepared to receive them" (1957:5; cf. Rouget, 1985). For the Kalabari of Nigeria, drums are critical to inducing possession and controlling its course. In the typical festival, an invocation asks that the dancer be given "ears to hear the drum, and smart feet to follow it" in order to bring the gods as guests into the village. "A dancer is praised for his performance under possession because, although he is not strictly accountable for his actions at this time, he has to dance with some com- petence before the spirit. . .will deign to mount him" (Horton:43). Kalabari people talk about the drummer "inflaming" or "cooling" the spirits and "putting them up to" various movements (Horton:23). Among some groups, however, the musicians play a subordinate role and follow the dancers (Hanna, 1982). In West Java, neither musician nor dancer but a spirit controller determines the sequence and develop- ment of possession dances. Musicians told Foley (1985) not to waste her time talking to a girl who, possessed by a goddess, danced the sintren but to talk instead to the pawang man who, through jimat (a magically charged object) and the mantra (chant) he utters under his breath, calls the spirits into the bodies of the dancers. He insures that the perform- ers, who conceive of themselves as empty vessels moved by the spirits, will emerge from the experience unharmed. The dancers are like pup- pets in a puppeteer's hands. While there is an authentic abandonment and submission to posses- sion, the specific characteristics of the seizure are culturally determined. For the Alur of Uganda dance and trance behavior are both highly styl- ized, even when their movements are violent. Socialization to the styl- ized movements begins at infancy, so "to become possessed is itself to</page><page sequence="8">288 Journal of the American Academy of Religion give oneself up to a pre-ordained pattern" (Southall:243). Children often play at possession. The gods speak to the community through the possessed dancer to help individuals or the group cope. For example, among the Ga of Ghana, possession dance is a crucial element of the new year's rituals that request supernatural assistance for the well-being of the tribe in the coming twelve months. Such needs as rain, fish, crops, and health are presented to the god, who then, through mediums whose state of pos- session is induced by dance, delivers prophetic messages about the com- ing year's events and how to deal with them (Field:54). The phenomenon of possession is an important attribute to the priesthood of the Fanti of Ghana. In fact, the term for priest (komfo) is a combination of kom (possession) andfo (people). Because the deities love to dance, the priests assemble drummers and become possessed. While in this state, a priest talks in a low guttural voice, or rarely, in a high falsetto, which indicates that the deity is speaking through him about the cause and cure of a problem (Christensen:258, 261). Public display of possession in some cases gives status to an individ- ual. Among the Kaka people in northwest Cameroon, the ntsham soci- ety members dance through the heat of the day at the termination of their initiation rites in the hope that someone will become possessed. The person who images the divine is deemed worthy to preside over the society until next year's annual dance (Gebauer: 11). Although the Kalanga of Zimbabwe believe that troubles are the immediate cause for a spirit host to dance while possessed, there is a dogma that for the sake of health and good crops, a host ought season- ally to dance while possessed at the year's end, before first hoeing, and at first fruits: "The guardian spirit may be divined to have brought affliction merely out of hunger for offerings, and of love for the ritual's dance" (Werbner:221). Women's possession dance appears related to the crises of marriage and birth. Marriage is a journey into the unknown with uncertain out- come. Birth is surrounded with the doubts of success, sanctions for fail- ure, and pain. Among the Irigwe of northern Nigeria, the traditional marriage system calls for both men and women to marry several spouses from different tribal areas and for the women to shift residence among husbands several times during their lifetime. Perhaps to relieve the ten- sion "arising from their repeated separations from loved ones and to achieve social integration to compensate. . .for the repeated separa- tions," Irigwe women often become possessed during spirit cult dances, "cry, speak in tongues, and flail about after the frenetic drumming,</page><page sequence="9">Hanna: Divinity in Dance 289 dancing, singing, and rattling leg irons had induced a dissociated state in them. . .giving vent without castigation to their repressed feelings" (Sangree: 1055). In a few isolated villages of Bali, the old indigenous Sang Hyang or Sang Hyang Dedari is still performed as a rite of purification and exor- cism when the community is in severe difficulty. Two or three virgin girls, ten to twelve years of age become possessed through inhaling incense smoke and hearing the rhythmic chanting of a large male choir and another chorus of women. Bandem says, When the dancers have been thoroughly possessed, they are considered to have been entered by the gods, who are thus literally made mani- fest. .. .The dancers are lifted to the shoulders of men who carry them about as they sway and undulate, balancing themselves without appar- ent effort above the surrounding crowd. Despite the lack of formal dance instruction, while deep in trance they execute a series of dance movements in a very particular style. The movement vocabulary seems to be based on the imitation of certain movements from nature, such as. . .trees swaying in the wind;. . .a tree bowed down beneath the weight of many flowers;.. .dragonfly movements; and.. .a deer pestered by biting flies (1983:114). This dance provided the key source of the more secular, though still ceremonial, legong dance, which does not make divinity manifest. Rather, developed under active royal patronage, legong is performed for the god's entertainment (and falls in the fifth category discussed later). Some cultures have a possession specialist. The shaman who brings the deities from the supernatural world to the human habitat is found in Africa, Asia, Oceania, and Europe, and among Eskimos and North and South American Indians. In Korea, where the female shaman is mudag and the male shaman is paksu or paksu mudang, the polite address is mansin, referring to "ten thousand spirits." Kendall (1983, 1985) describes the most elaborate shaman ritual, the kut, which aims to bring good fortune, to heal, or to send off the dead. Following a progression in which certain deities appear in place and sequence, this ritual requires altered states of consciousness, euphoria achieved through repetitive drum beating, cymbal clashing, and movement. Dance is a means to invoke the gods and encourage their descent into the shaman. The female shaman (who outnumbers the male practitioner in male- dominated Korea), is a specialist for housewives. She essentially gives a "women's party" by and for women. Claiming to see the deities and beckon them to speak through her lips, the shaman will put on the costume of a particular god. The wardrobe includes items of prestigious</page><page sequence="10">290 Journal of the American Academy of Religion male attire: the white robe monks wear for temple dances, an antique high-crowned hat, broad-sleeved robe for a king or his official, and blue vest and broad-rimmed black hat that petty functionaries wore in dynas- tic times. To drum accompaniment, the shaman sings an invocation and then stretches out her arms and dances gracefully and lightly to the music. A burst of drumbeats and her series of leaps reveal the descent of the gods. Kicks and flailing arms tell everyone that the gods are strong. After several shamans have invoked several of the sponsoring fam- ily's household gods, the shamans rest. During this interval the mugam, dance in shaman's clothing, occurs. One after another of the women of the household, and their relatives and neighbors, puts on a mansin's cos- tume and dances to receive her personal god. The women call them- selves "half-shamans" (pan mudag). Both the mansin and mugam performer may clutch the front open- ings of the costume in each hand so that the front panels, gored to the waist, move up and down with the broad sweeping arm gestures. The women take a series of broad diagonal steps with knees slightly bent, the body weight balanced on the heels, torso held straight. Slow drum- beats coax the god's descent. When the drummer picks up speed of the continuing rhythmic pattern, the dancer images the divine as she jumps up and down on the balls of her feet, kicks, toes pointing upward with alternative feet, jumps in place, and revolves on the balls of her feet, pumps her hands up and down in unison or in alternation still holding her costume, flinging her arms out to the side and in front of her chest. She thrusts her arms away from herself repeatedly. The woman may grimace in intense pain or pleasure. When she tires, she collapses before the drum in a head-to-the-floor bow as she did before beginning the performance, which lasts from five to ten minutes from initial cos- tuming to final bow. A mansin then removes the costume and shakes it over the woman's head to encourage the possessing deity's provision of good fortune. The mugam is also fun and refreshing, a cathartic release in a public letting-go. Maidens and young brides are not supposed to use the mugam or people will think they are wild. In the Japanese Kami-gakari rituals of possession, male and female shamans danced to induce divine possession. They drew upon two styles of interrelated movement. Circular movement called mai invited possession. Thereupon, the possessed, ecstatic, moved vertically in jumping or leaping called odori. In this state, the dancer accompanied him or herself with a musical instrument or song or else the energy of movement arose spontaneously from some inner impulse (Kozo:106).</page><page sequence="11">Hanna: Divinity in Dance 291 Invasion Possession. This kind of possession indicates that a super- natural being has overwhelmed an individual and caused some form of malaise, illness, or personal misfortune. A dance signifying this super- natural entity is used to recognize and appease the being, who then frees the possessed individual. The dance may use the same forms of encod- ing meaning as in the invited possession dances (icon, metaphor, meto- nym) and fulfill similar functions. Among Shona of Zimbabwe, when a spirit selects someone as its medium, the future host falls ill, fails to respond to ordinary cures, and eventually is divined to be chosen by a particular spirit to accept it. The individual shows acceptance of the spirit through performing its own songs and dances in accord with the appropriate ritual in the cult devoted to it. After a month or two, the sick person recovers (Gelfand:30-99, 117-78). Meeting the wishes of a spirit as part of exorcism frequently imposes obligations on those related to the possessed. A neglected wife, for example, may become the center of attention, a recipient of gifts, or a worker with a reduced load. Thus, possession is a metaphor of social pathology or maladjustment. Invited Supernatural Potency. Individuals may be possessed by a supernatural potency as well as by a supernatural entity. For example, the Lango of Uganda describe the hypnotic power of dance in terms of jok that is liberated or generated notably in stylized movements. The prolonged and vigorous rhythms of the dance cast a spell over the par- ticipants; they feel they have started up a mysterious power, which even- tually controls their bodies and minds (Castle:52). Similarly, but with application to health practice, the !Kung Bush- men of Namibia (South West Africa) have n/um, "the supernatural potency from which the medicine men derive their power to cure." Activated in the dance, n/um may overwhelm an individual and enable him to protect the people from sickness and death (Marshall:347). The medicine dancer goes into trance and in this state may communicate with spirits, although not be possessed by them. The ceremonial curing dance is called for during crisis situations or may occur spontaneously for good measure. What is referred to as "feeling the spirit" through dance occurs in a number of Christian denominations. Since many churches branded dancing as sinful, certain behavioral patterns formerly called dancing were renamed and otherwise modified. In the United States some churches permitted the Shout and Ring-Shout as substitutes for the banned dancing common to African and West Indian religious ceremo- nies (Emery). Similarly, in a Yoruba village in western Nigeria, the</page><page sequence="12">292 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Assemblies of God congregation prohibits dancing. Yet, during a ser- vice I observed, worshippers in the church aisle performed the same movements I had seen Yoruba people dance in other villages. When I asked what the church members were doing, I was told, "feeling the spirit." A black American Pentecostal church in Pittsburgh, the Church of Holy Christ believes God is the Father of Christ, conceived by the Holy Ghost, and born of Virgin Mary (M. Williams, 1974). Dying for the sins of humans, Christ arose to Heaven to prepare a place for them, leaving the Holy Ghost for their comfort. On the day of Pentecost, the Holy Ghost descended to the apostles, whom he gave "quickening powers" with speaking in tongues, dancing, and other manifestations of spiritual possession. Dance is thus treated as a divine occurrence. God reveals Himself to those upon whom He has bestowed the Holy Ghost. Sister Saber, for example, participates enthusiastically in every emotional sing- ing and dancing part of worship as an active dancer, clapper, and singer. If someone starts a song that reaches an emotional pitch to precipitate a dance, Sister Saber will move over to the singer and give her visual support. In the United House of Prayer for All People in New Haven, Conn., founded by C. E. (Sweet Daddy) Grace, the theology is similar to that of other eschatological churches that emphasize imminent doom and sal- vation. The church service of joy in the House of the Lord includes the dance trance. It is spoken of as dancing for God and completely replaces forbidden social dancing (Alland:206). The dancing is individ- ualistic, with bending to and fro; varying degrees of pelvic movement; Lindy-type steps; head steady, rocking, or vigorously snapped; hands waved or rubbed over hip and abdomen in apparently erotic gestures; and facial expressions of pain or euphoria. I was the only white in the Mt. Pisgah Missionary Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas, on the 25th anniversary of the Senior Men's Choir, "Golden Harvest Day" (Hanna, 1988c). Prior to the service, the woman sitting next to me said that I should not worry about anything I would see. The church preacher and choir and a visiting preacher and choir challenged each other to excel in their respective performances. When- ever the fervor would reach a high emotional pitch, individuals in the pews shouted, "amen," "preach it honey," "yes sir," "get on with it." They cried, nodded heads back and forth, swayed sideward, raised their palms upward, shook, clapped their hands, and danced to the accompa- niment in a blues/boogie rhythm of the choir, pianist, and organist. The singers, too, "felt the spirit" in these ways. After dancing, some rather</page><page sequence="13">Hanna: Divinity in Dance 293 large women would collapse into the arms of equally hefty male ushers, who seated people and then held positions near the pulpit where the singers often became possessed and close to other members of the con- gregation known for their demonstrative behavior. Embodying the Supernatural: External Transformation Masquerade. Divinity may be imaged in sacred masquerade dances as part of a people's intercourse with the spirit world. And some mas- queraders do become possessed in ways discussed earlier. In the Ivory Coast, the Nafana Bedu masked dancers appear almost nightly during one lunar month of the Nafana year to bless and purify the village dwellings and their occupants. The Bedu spirits, believed to live in the masks, absorb "all evil, misfortune, difficulties, and negativ- ity," which are taken by them and removed from the community, "so that the next year is started fresh and clean" (D. Williams:20). The Tyi Wara masked (antelope headdress) dance of the Bamana of Mali represents the god of agriculture, a supernatural being, half animal and half man. Performed to invoke the god's blessing on man's agricul- tural effort, the dance was part of the ritual supporting a difficult yet essential undertaking for survival: farming poor savana land (Imperato, 1970). By their very difference, masked dancers may enforce desired social behavior. A specific example of the intertwining of sacred and profane and religion and politics in masked dances comes from the Nsukka area of Igboland in Nigeria. Tamuno reports that "masked dancers, purport- ing to represent a spirit cult, omabe, were employed by the council of elders whenever there was difficulty in enforcing law and order" (1966:105). The Wiko people in Zambia have makishi masqueraders representing resurrected ancestors and other supernatural beings who patrol the vicinities of the boys' initiation lodges to ward off intruders, the women, and non-Wiko (Mubitana:59). Among some groups, as in northeast Liberia, the masks embody the authority of local chiefs, who appear masked in public appearances. From Kerala, India, the Kathakali dance-drama exemplifies the enactment of Hindu mythology (Jones and Jones, 1970). The stylized renderings of epics and legends create a world of the supernatural that humans cannot know with certainty. Males, enacting male and female roles, metamorphose to the imaged world by enlarging their human pro- portions in width and height and with dazzling, rich multicolored adornment. The make-up, both lengthy and ritualistic in application,</page><page sequence="14">294 Journal of the American Academy of Religion involves creating masks on the face; that of the hero is the most elaborate. Masks often inspire in spectators a sense of dignity and mystery for the deities, spirits, and ancestors; or, they may simply evoke a sense of awe toward the unknown. The masked dancer is often revered and experienced as a veritable apparition of the being he represents--even when it is known that a man made the mask and is wearing it. When he dons his masquerade costume the dancer undergoes a transfiguration; his identity is concealed and lost, and a new one revealed. This is not to say that he cannot also provide fun and amusement with zany clowning. In some cases, no sharp distinction is drawn between sacred and pro- fane, awe and humor, and the masquerade serves both spheres simulta- neously. In other instances, there may be different masqueraders for each realm. Deification Through Consecration and Role-play Dancing. Dance- plays, Ramalilas and Krishnalilas, centered upon the life story of Krishna or Rama are found throughout India. Often the actors and locales are transformed into the characters and places of the story while the audience identifies the young boy performers with the mythical heroes. The youths are treated with the deference and worship due the gods and goddesses temporarily incarnate in them. During the twenty days of the Ramalila, those who play Rama and his brothers are deified, and the audience worships them as an icon. In Mathura, those who play Rama, his wife, and his brother belong to the brahman caste because "when they appear in costume and crown as the very embodi- ments (svarups) of the divinities, even brahmans will bow down to them and worship them. . ." (Hein:72). The boy, under the age of puberty, is "not merely the living similitude of the deity represented, but is in fact the abode of that divinity" (Hein:18). Because the performers are so young, the quality of the raslila depends upon the sensitivity of the trainer. Hein claims that Ramalila was born of the ancient drama, probably in North India between A.D. 1200 and 1500. But the three centuries of severe Moslem rule brought the decay of both the financial and intellec- tual support of the dancers. Classical Hindu dance training was long and costly. "As the training of dancers degenerated and the incompre- hension of Hindu spectators spread, the old technique must have faltered until it no longer communicated the epic effectively" (Hein:124- 25). To supplement or replace the mudras (gestures), ordinary prose speech, simplified stage technique, and musical recitation of the text were introduced.</page><page sequence="15">Hanna: Divinity in Dance 295 The lilas are referred to as deeds or sports of Vishnu; ras is the name of a deed in which Vishnu, engaged in his Krishna incarnation, favored gopis (milkmaids) on a moonlit autumn night by dancing with them in an ancient circular dance called the rasa. Krishna had suddenly van- ished from the circle of young women, who then searched for him in vain among the forest trees. To overcome their despair, they mimicked his actions. Upon seeing their intense devotion, Krishna returned to them. Dance is the Raslila's first element, most sacred component, and recurrent feature. It is followed by a one-act play based on any one of the multitude of Krishna's lilas. During the dance, Krishna creates the illusion of duplicating himself so each gopi believes that her partner is Krishna. When the young Krishna is suddenly multiplied, the circle dancing becomes complex. For the climax, Krishna and Radha (his principal consort) stand in the center to cries of ecstasy as devotees prostrate themselves before the young dancers who have become deities for a special time and space. The players of Krishna, Radha, and the gopis are initiated, consecrated, and deified for the duration of the cycle plays (Vatsyayan, 1987). The preliminaries preceding a performance are obviously critical. The Raslila performance is replayed so that as Krishna himself appears for the gopis who dramatize his greatness and charm, the people through hearing and seeing his lilas will be blessed by the beatific vision of Krishna himself. In Manipur, women perform these rituals, and they, too, are deified for the period of their role-play dancing. Manifestation of Becoming One With a God Toward Enlightenment From Tibet and Turkey come examples of this form of imaging the divine, which is similar to embodying the supernatural in an inner transformation through possession by a potency or spirit. However, the category of becoming one with a god differs in that the goal is enlighten- ment, a mental state. Lingdro Dechen Rolmo, "The Music of Great Bliss Which Is a Dance of Ling," is a Tibetan ritual practice performed by lay men and women to involve the individual in the mandala. It refers, inter alia, to circle center, gathering of people, an offering, and in purified form, the celestial world. Intricate and multi-layered, the mandala symbolizes metaphorically and metonymically the subtleties of awakened Buddha-</page><page sequence="16">296 Journal of the American Academy of Religion mind. Siddhartha Gautama (5th century B.C.), known as the Buddha or "Awakened One," taught many means of eradicating human suffering toward the goal of enlightenment. Lerner (1987) studied Lingdro in a Tibetan refugee settlement in Orissa where the dance has been transplanted. It synthesizes secular folk dance movements and sung meditational texts that contain teach- ings of Vajrayana Buddhism. Unlike other forms that seek to deny worldly pleasures, Vajrayana Buddhism employs the body to achieve enlightenment. The body is a microcosmic mandala of the universe (the limbs symbolize the four continents; the head, Mt. Meru; the eyes, the sun and moon) and symbolically the palace of the deity (limbs are pil- lars, orifices, the entrances). The circular path and turning movement of the dance are forms of mandalic circling. Dancing in a clockwise direction, the way the planets move around the sun, seals the sacred space within which the Buddha Ling Gesar, deified national hero of Tibet, symbol of the mind free from ignorance, and subject of a great epic, is enticed for the performers to receive his blessing. In Buddhism, deities are "perceived as archetypal embodiments of the psychic qualities operative in the enlightened mind" (Lerner:22). Dancers banish negativity from the sacred area by vigorously stamping it into the ground and summoning prosperity for themselves and the community (the larger mandala). Lingdro's goal is to transform the performer's ordinary body, speech, and mind into the mandalas of the body, speech, and mind of the Bud- dha. Gesar's deeds are interpreted as a magical display of his divine power. The original Lingdro was the great Tibetan teacher Mipham Rinpoche's vision of Gesar and his retinue performing a dance. Cos- tumed as Gesar and his retinue, dancers reenact the vision to recreate history while invoking a realm beyond. Since the 12th century, monks from Ladakh, formerly an autono- mous kingdom and now part of India, travelled to central Tibet for training. This place was the stronghold of the traditional Mahayana Buddhist culture until the Chinese invaded Tibet and closed its borders in 1949. One of the techniques of liberation from suffering learned in Tibet is the sacred dance 'chams, sometimes called mystery drama, which is performed in Ladakhi monasteries. The dancer's intention is to "benefit others by displaying the qualities and appearance of the pro- tector deities and to attain the state of non-dual existence in which he recognizes that the nature of his own mind is identical with the space- like, primordial mind of the deity (Green:23). Some of the dances cre- ated are based on spontaneous visions of inspired practitioners.</page><page sequence="17">Hanna: Divinity in Dance 297 Green explains that complex techniques of tantric deity yoga form the underlying basis of the dances. They involve the process of medita- tive visualization occurring in stages, which transforms the individual's ordinary self-image and world-view into that of an enlightened deity who resides within a celestial palace or mandala. Features of 'chams include meditation, dance movement, mudra, mantra (repetition of sacred syllables), music, costume, mask, and ritual implements. Per- formers are viewed as sacred deities who are dancing within their mandala. The ecstasy-inducing, yet usually decorous, whirling dances of the Islamic mystic order founded by Mevlana Jalludin Rumi are another manifestation of becoming one with God toward enlightenment. The dervishes (men on the threshold of enlightenment), with immobile faces, revolve in long white shirts, their covered arms outstretched, mov- ing slowly at first and then faster until they reach a spiritual trance. The dervishes believe the turning dance accompanied by repeated chanting vibrates the energy centers of the body to raise it to higher spheres toward detaching the self from the earth in order to achieve an inner experience of illumination and to unite with a nonpersonified god (Friedlander, 1975). Al Faruqi points out that only among such mystics of Islam (the Sufis) are objects, persons, and activities viewed as symbolic of some- thing absent, hidden, or esoteric. This Sufi perspective contradicts orthodox interpretations of the doctrine of Tawhid, which hold that God is transcendent and distinguishable from His creation and that therefore no aspect of human existence is properly identifiable with Him (168, 172). Revelation of Divinity Through Dance Creation A Protestant Christian view makes artistic self-expression analogous to the creative self-expression of God the Creator, Augustine's image. Dancing a set piece is considered a reflection of the unknowable god's immanence, irrespective of the performer's intention. The dancer is to dance as God is to creation. Wolterstorff recapitulates the Augustinian view: God creates in accord with his own ideas, giving free, untrammel- led expression to His inner self. These new realities are not independ- ent of God, identical with Him, or copies of eternal paradigms but full- bodied creations in their own right (51). Wolterstorff says that the devaluation of the physical side of God's creation has taken the form of persons longing for disembodiment and the argument that God is to be</page><page sequence="18">298 Journal of the American Academy of Religion worshipped because He is nonphysical. However, such forms of devalu- ation defy God's affirmation of his creation. Moreover, denigration of the physical implies denigration of oneself (69). Considering humans to be God's creation, some people believe the language of movement is God-given and both the progression of a dancer's training and the perfection of performance reveal God's achievement. Within this orientation, dancers accept their calling as a gift from God (Fallon and Wolbers, 1982). United Presbyterian clergywoman Rock describes images of divinity this way: "I experienced God; and God moves in these ways" (7). "If we believe that God is not mysterious at all, that God's ways are per- fectly clear and understandable, then we will be mainly concerned about being visible and assuming static postures. However, if we believe that the Spirit moves mysteriously and where it will, and that our business is to respond, our dance will be full of movement, covering space, not always pretty-and perhaps not always even visible" (8). "When I am watching from the congregation, an effective religious dance...springs from someone else's relationship with God and the world to illumine my own relationship with God and the world" (11). Within the Franciscan view that God is present in good works and in the creative force of the arts, the Roman Catholic Church sanctions dance-rituals throughout Latin America. As a creative force, the human is God's representative on earth; in the dance-ritual, the participants become one with creation (Cashion:249). Note that during the Italian Renaissance it was thought that only God creates, whereas the artist invents or comes upon a work. Kirstein tells us about the influence of religion on the work of renowned New York City Ballet choreographer George Balanchine. From the time of his infant Russian Greek Orthodox baptism, Balanchine felt the impact of the church's sensuous and visual impres- sions, celebration of saints, their feats, festivals, and icons (sacred pic- tures). Zernov notes: "The Eastern service takes the form of dramatic action by which the whole of life of the Incarnate is reenacted by the congregation" (64). Moreover, "the East believes that the Incarnation revealed the existence of an organic unity between the divine and the human and that material things, no less than man's mind and spirit, can be used by God for His purpose" (102-3). When Balanchine saw the Church with its enormous cathedrals and the specially dressed clergy, he said, "That also to me was God. Not that it's 'God Invisible.' I don't know what that is. God is this wonder- ful dress you see. Even now, always, I have to say I couldn't just think</page><page sequence="19">Hanna: Divinity in Dance 299 of God in some abstract way, to connect with Him just by spirit, by mind" (quoted in Kirstein, 20). "To Balanchine, concepts or images of the divine, even cant uses of 'divine' as shibboleth of quality ('My dear, she danced divinely!') had their daily resonance." Divinity in this sense refers to given by, proceeding from, having the sanction of, or inspired by God. Balanchine spoke of his dancers as angels. "Throughout his long life, he contrived to encounter these supernatural beings or, rather, their corporeal embodiments, whose habitual flights he made soar into steps less ordinary than heavenly" (18). Kirstein believes Balanchine's ballets can be read as icons for the laity (23). Certainly such expressions of divinity are in marked contrast to the others discussed in this essay. Eliade speaks of the sacred in modem art: "It has become unrecognizable; it is camouflaged in forms, purposes and meanings which are apparently profane. . .it is no longer expressed in conventional religious language" (180). Rather than an icon as used in the past, a style may convey religious concepts and feelings. Tillich articulates the view that the artist's presentation of ultimate concern or reality is in some sense sacred. God is more than ultimate reality but the idea of God includes this reality. Images of the Divine as Entertainment The representation and reality of the divinity in dance discussed thus far may entertain in addition to fulfilling other functions. There are also representations intended primarily for enjoyment. In India, Hindu female temple dancers, devadasis, commonly danced (in the style called Bharata Natyam) the exploits of various gods. The women symbolically played both gods and goddesses, devils and demons. Married to deities in ceremonies comparable to earthly marriages and dedicated to tem- ples, the devadasis danced here to show their devotion and entertain the deities. Outside they performed at festivals involving the larger commu- nity. Common themes were about Lord Krishna and his amorous adventures. Entertaining dances also have their didactic dimensions: a supernatural model legitimizes human social behavior. "Temple" dancing, as mentioned earlier, had fallen into disrepute because the institution had become corrupted. However, as India's nationalists moved toward political independence, the search for cul- tural freedom led to the revival of indigenous dance. The classical dance has now become the province not of women dedicated to temples but of westem-educated, respectable middle-class young women. Their public performance after much study is a ritual in some ways comparable to a</page><page sequence="20">300 Journal of the American Academy of Relgion debutante presentation. Those who excel may perform in western-type artistic/entertainment settings. For example, Indrani said when she dances in India the Kuchipudi style Chamundeswari Shadbam tale of the unconquerable Goddess Durga, who successfully battles the demon Mahishasura, "Many people jump up in the audience and shout at the end. . .Because they worship Goddess Durga and they feel as though it's a manifestation and they cry out, 'Long live the Goddess' as they would during the ceremonials. And this has been very thrilling. But it's also considered very dangerous knowing they are almost worshipping you and something might go wrong, and they might destroy something. They are very capricious people. But I love the piece, and I do not let that bother me" (quoted in Hanna, 1983:73). Indrani's performance in the United States, however, is merely theater. In the United States, theatrical dance in churches, public theaters, film, and television portrays scenes and incidents as well as concepts from the Bible. These presentations tend to be images of aspects of divinity (rather than of God) and part of the entertainment world, litur- gical dance excepted (see Manor, 1980). CONCLUSION In this exploratory essay on religion in action, I have attempted to identify categories of images of the divine in dance. Through dance, a manifold option for religious practice, an individual may see, be absorbed in, or animated by the divine. More than the last two, the first three categories of embodying the supernatural (inner transformation, outer transformation, and manifestation of becoming one with God toward enlightenment) tend to have a greater degree of prescription or traditional rules for what is done and how. In these categories, the images of the divine are believed to become coterminous with the divine rather than the image being symbolic of the supernatural; the sign and object become one. The last two categories (revelation of divinity through dance creation and entertaining images of the divine), of more recent vintage, permit a greater range of expression and reflect the impact of secularization. Dance is rarely studied over time, and it is important to discover if reported traditions persist, transform, or disappear. The tentacles of contact with other faiths and forces of modernization touch most reli- gions. For example, recognition of the intimate relationship of dance to religion in Africa led zealous Christian missionaries, especially English-</page><page sequence="21">Hanna: Divinity in Dance 301 speakers, to stamp out many dances. The Chinese closing of the border of Tibet, the source of religious sustenance and dance instruction for Ladakh, negatively affected Ladakhi traditional religious dance. Some- times old practices disappear, but frequently they persist and are overlaid with new beliefs and customs. Some traditional faiths with dance practices collapse because of their ineffectiveness and incongruity in the face of technological demands, scientific requirements, and the advent of humanism and Marxism (see Smart:498, 517). Yet these forces have only superficially permeated many rural areas and urban and periurban pockets of migrants insulate themselves in the cloak of traditional security and well-established dance patterns. At times, the clash of old and new creates a crisis of declining religious plausibility, often linked to a moral breakdown, and gives rise to forms of sectarianism and new religious movements. Some seek to restore lost dance practices or to renew withering ones. Contem- porary revulsion against the social impact of technology has led to yet another pattern: a turning toward sentient relationships among humans realized through dance, religious or otherwise, but interpreted within religious precepts.
