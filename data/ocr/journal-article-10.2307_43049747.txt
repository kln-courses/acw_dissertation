Full disclosure: I was a student of Keith Ward's in 1971-72, when I read for a postgraduate degree in the philosophy of religion. We have seen each other frequently over the years and I consider him a friend. I am risking a biased review because I believe that Ward's writings are far less appreciated in this country than I think they should be. In these books, Ward puts Christianity on the offensive, using logical arguments and scientific research to demonstrate the power of its doctrinal system. As the subtitle to Why There Most Certainly is a God : Doubting Dawkins suggests, the biology-based atheism propounded most prominently by fellow Oxford professor Richard Dawkins is the</page><page sequence="2">354 ANGLICAN AND EPISCOPAL HISTORY main target of this book. Against various claims in Dawkins' works, arguments are offered to defend the scientific possibility that the universe was created and designed as well as the logical possibility that a God exists. Ward notes that the physical sciences can't explain all there is; for example, biologists admit that they can't account for the emergence of consciousness from matter. And even people who do not believe in God detect a moral value and spiritual purpose in the universe. In addition to his extensive responses to Dawkins' skeptical ar- guments, Ward supports the classical Christian concept of God against the anthropomorphic ideas of those Christians who think of God as, "some sort of human-like being with lots of fairly arbitrary characteristics" (78). Because what he calls the "God Hypothesis" is "elegant, economical and comprehensive," (48) it has an appeal- ing simplicity compared with the secular picture of a "huge set of complicated quantum laws and a very finely balanced set of fun- damental physical forces, all of which are realized sooner or later by some unknown principle" (57). More than Matter ? Is There More to Life Than Molecules? also chal- lenges the view that science leads inevitably to skepticism - in this case, by criticizing the arguments in support of materialism, de- fending the coherence of Christianity, and finally mounting a broad attack on atheism that is allegedly based on physics. For example, Ward points out that materialist theory is no longer sup- ported by many physicists, who describe in mathematical terms a re- ality that is outside of space-time (85). The equivalent adversary to Dawkins in More than Matteria Gilbert Ryle, one of Ward's professors at Oxford. Ryle was noted in the mid-twentieth century for his claim that philosophers after Descartes were mistaken in believing in the existence of mind, which was actually just "a ghost in a machine." Ward offers a different idea of mind: a dual-aspect theory that recognizes that the brain gives rise to thoughts and that the mental can influence the physical. Thus, mental and physical events should be regarded as different "aspects of one composite reality" (151) - a composite reality that is neither ghost nor machine. Is Religion Irrational ? considers a number of arguments popular among the new atheists, such as the problem of evil and the alleged incompatibility of reason and faith. Although the book</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 355 defends religion in general, it contains more discussion of Chris- tianity than the other two books. Ward also further develops his version of the orthodox concept of God. For example, while he would prefer not to term God "a person," he would say that "God is a personal reality - a self-existent and eternal being whom we least misleadingly picture as having knowledge of all possible things, the will to create finite things for the sake of goodness, and the intention to realize such goodness as fully as possible" (68). Ward shows how Christianity is strengthened when strong arguments are presented for the possibility that there is a God. Thus, we should avoid thinking that, "God is an invisible person who actually talks to people inside their heads, and who might literally be pleased or angry when we do things God likes or dis- likes" (67). Ward even goes so far as to say that, "God is infinitely different from any finite mind, and we have to realize that we cannot imagine what God is really like in any way" (66). Since Ward has written so many pages that seem to imagine what God is like, he is probably referring here to the classical idea that God, being infinite, cannot be known in essence. We can't imagine how God knows God-self. Most educated readers will appreciate Ward's remarkable knowledge of philosophy, theology, science, logic, and the mzyor world religions. It is a bit curious that although he is canon of Christ Church as well as Regius Professor of Divinity Emeritus at Oxford, Ward rarely mentions Anglicanism. Yet his writings draw from scripture, tradition, and reason in such a way that it is hard to picture him in any other branch of Christendom. The titles of these three books show how subject matter fits together: if more than matter exists, then God perhaps is possible. If there is possibly a God, then religion is not irrational. And if religion is not irrational, a very large part of the case for religion has been made. All three books show the inadequacy of the materialism that is accepted as common sense truth not only by atheists, but by av- erage agnostics who don't bother to think very much about religion. A careful examination of Christian tradition suggests that it is ratio- nal and credible. J. Douglas Ousley Church of the Incarnation, New York City</page></plain_text>
