JEALOUSY AND SEXUAL PROPERTY KINGSLEY DAVIS Smith College I D ESCARTES defined jealousy as "a kind of fear related to a desire to preserve a possession." He was, if we look at what is customarily called jealous behavior, eminently correct. In every case it is apparently a fear or rage reaction to a threatened appropriation of one's own, or what is desired as one's own, property. Conflicts over property involve four major elements: Owner, Object, Public, and Rival (or Trespasser). These have a slightly different nature and a slightly different relation according to whether the conflict situation is one of regulated and legitimate competition or of illegitimate trespass. In the former case Ego is a would-be owner and his enemy a rival. A popular fallacy has been to conceive the jealous situation as a triangle. Actually it is a quadrangle, and the failure to in- clude the public or community element has led to a failure to grasp the social character of jealousy. The relationships between the four elements are institu- tionally defined. They constitute the fixed traditional constellation of rights, obligations, and neutralities called prop- erty, and are sustained by interacting attitudes. Since property, however, is not always actually in the hands of the owner, ownership must be distinguished from possession, the one being a matter of law and mores, the other a matter of fact. Possession by a person other than the owner may be either licit or illicit. Illicit possession shows that institutions of prop- erty are susceptible of evasion; licit pos- session by one not the owner, as with a borrowed or rented piece of property, emphasizes their strength. Acquisition of property proceeds usually according to socially established rules of competition, and, in many cases, by stages. In the initial stage the field is generally open to a class of persons, anybody in this class being free to put in a claim. The qualifying rounds of an amateur golf tournament or the sudden entrance of a strange but attractive young woman are cases in point. Gradually a few com- petitors take the lead. Social order then requires that others recognize the su- periority of these, quit struggling, and turn their attention elsewhere. Finally, after continued competition among the favored few, one competitor wins. This is the signal for everyone who was ini- tially interested to drop all pretense of a claim and take his defeat in good spirit. Competition for this -particular piece of 395</page><page sequence="2">396 SOCIAL FORCES property is now, by social edict, either temporarily or permanently over. It is owned by one man, behind whose title stands the authority of the community. Values, however, do not invariably change hands in any such orderly fashion. The unscrupulous stand always ready to take possession in defiance of the rules, to replace the orderliness of rivalry with the disarrangement of trespass. They may at any stage, under peril of organized retaliation, upset the procedure and seize physical possession of the property. There are thus two dangers which beset any person with regard to property. The first is that somebody will win out over him in legitimate competition. This is the danger of superior rivalry. The sec- ond is that somebody will illegitimately take from him property already acquired. This is the danger of trespass. Most malignant emotions are concerned with these two dangers, being directed either at a rival or trespasser or at someone who is helping a rival or trespasser. Such emotions may be suppressed by the group culture or utilized for maintaining the organized distribution of property. In general fear and hatred of rivals is in- stitutionally suppressed; fear and hatred of trespassers encouraged. In the initial stages of acquisition fear of rivals is frequently paramount. Such fear is merely the obverse side of strong desire to win. In so far as a society fosters the desire to win and builds up an emo- tional drive in the individual to that end, it inevitably fosters the fear of losing. By the same token, when defeat actually occurs it implies a frustration of strong desire, hence an inevitable emotion. This emotion, since most competitors cannot win, occurs frequently. Yet social or- ganization requires that such emotions, once the property is in the winner's hands, be curbed. Society tends neces- sarily to suppress them, and to encourage one-time rivals to be "good sports," "graceful losers." The successful rival, however, need not suppress these emotions. Once estab- lished as owner, he is encouraged by the culture to express them toward any trespasser. Free expression of malevolent emotion against a trespasser protects the established distribution of property and maintains the fixed rules for its compet- itive acquisition. II Can the relationship of affection be- tween two persons be conceived as a prop- erty relationship? This is a question not to be answered too glibly. The affec- tional relationship is certainly not iden- tical with economic property, -although sheer sexual gratification, as in prostitu- tion, may be. Affection assumes that the object is desired in and for itself. It therefore cannot be bought and sold; it is not a means to something else, not an economic thing. Yet the affectional re- lationship has features that are charac- teristic of property in general. It is regulated, highly institutionalized; and involves some sort of institutionalized exclusiveness, hedged about with rights and obligations. There is competition for possession, a feeling of ownership on the part of the successful competitor, a "hands-off" attitude on the part of the public, and a general resentment against anyone who endeavors to break up the relationship by "stealing" the object. In view of these, considerations I feel justified in applying the term property to the institutionalized possession of affec- tion. There exists no other term, appar- ently, which will describe those types of sanctioned possession which are not eco- nomic. Nevertheless the distinction be- tween economic and non-economic prop-</page><page sequence="3">THE FAMILY 397 erty must be made clear. This can be accomplished by a more detailed consid- eration of types and sub-types of property. Economic property is that type in which the object possessed is a means to an ulterior end. Non-economic property is that type in which the object is an end in itself. Several sub-types can be distin- guished under each head, but I shall rest content with distinguishing three kinds of economic and one kind of non-economic property, calling them by the attitude which Ego has in each case towards the object-respectively, need, vanity, pride, and love. i. Need. Some objects of property sat- isfy organic needs. Food, shelter, pros- titute, or servant may fall into this cate- gory. The object is not valued for itself, but simply as a means of satisfying the need; it may be bought, sold, and sub- stituted. The attitude of the public is subsidiary. A person desires the public to regard the object as his property, but solely because he needs it. z. Vanity. When an object is valued not for the satisfaction of a need but for the response it elicits in one's neighbors, and when the only connection between owner and object is mere possession, a new property situation is apparent. The at- titude of the public is no longer subsidiary but paramount. An expensive diamond, a top-hat, a long automobile are useless except as tokens and instrunients of the owner's social status. The ulterior end is the envious approval of the com- munity. Whereas in the need situation a rival or trespasser could proceed only by gaining possession of the actual object, he may in the vanity situation employ an additional procedure. He may gain the ulterior end by possession of a different but superior object. Vanity is often condemned on moral grounds because there is no necessary relationship between merit and possession of an enviable object. A fool may inherit a crown; an ignorant farmer acquire riches in oil; a silly girl possess incomparable beauty. When such people attribute merit to themselves for such possessions, they are vain, and such vanity, for the public, is thin and unlovely.' 3. Pride. This type is characterized by an intrinsic relation between owner and object. The object is some form of ac- complishment, and reflects professional ability. There is thus a necessary con- nection, recognized by the public, between the qualities of the owner and the nature of his possession. The ownership is in- deed more a matter of accomplishment than of legal technicality. All that law or the public can do is to recognize and protect it when, it comes; it cannot create it. 4. Love. In the three previous cases the object, while not necessarily inanimate or completely passive, takes no dynamic part in the equilibrium. In the present case, however, the object consists in a personal attitude-an attitude of affection. Since affection is a phenomenon of will, the question of possession is thereby placed largely in the hands of the object. Out of this peculiarity grow the other idiosyncrasies of love-property. We find, 1 This type, like the others, is of course an abstrac- tion-an ideal-type. Motives and attitudes in actual life situations are nearly always mixed. Need, vanity, pride, and love will be present in practically every concrete situation. Rarely, for example, is sheer possession the reason for the public's envy and respect. Usually the secret of such envy and respect is that possession conveys power. Such power may be valued merely for the envy it commands, in which case the relationship remains within the vanity type. Or it may be valued because it enables one to satisfy needs, to succeed in love, or to acquire skills, in which case it falls by implication into one of the other three types. In actual life, however, several or all of these attitudes are present in the same situation.</page><page sequence="4">398 SOCIAL FORCES for instance, that a jealous lover often attacks the love object herself, seeking to restrain or retaliate. Having control of the vital element in the situation-affec- tion-she is in a position to decide the issue. She can bestow affection either on Ego or on his rival, as she chooses. A man might destroy his food in order to keep another from getting it; he might destroy his jewels or other emblems of prestige; he might even renounce and for- sake his profession-but unless indulging in an anthropomorphic extravaganza he would not do this out of resentment to- ward the object itself. Yet in the case of sexual jealousy the resentment may be more against the object of love than against the rival. In the situations both of vanity and of pride we noted that the thing really de- sired was the envy or admiration of the public-in other words, an attitude. The same is true of the love situation, where an attitude of affection is desired. To this extent the three property situations are similar, and we do find that jealousy has been applied to all of them-especially to the pride situation as "professional jeal- ousy." (Only to the need situation does jealousy seem totally inapplicable.) Yet in spite of similarities we have to sepa- rate the love-property situation from the others, because the object possessed in this situation is purely an end in itself. This is a peculiarity which it shares with other forms of property. Moreover, the affec- tional relationship implies a reciprocal, mutual interchange between owner and object which is not true of the other forms. Thus the relationship, in addition to being an end in itself, gives the object a dynamic role in determining the direc- tion of the conflict situation. It may be, too, that conflicts over love generate more emotion than other kinds. When the object possessed is another person the universal process by which the owner identifies himself with the thing possessed (transmuting "mine" into "I") is per- haps more complete than when the object is not a person. Still this identification, simply because the object is not inert but willful, is probably most tenuous of all. The relationship thus being unusually close and at the same time unusually tenuous, becomes doubly intense. III In depicting the four types of property relationship we have stopped four proc- esses in mid-air. They are not static but dynamic-instable conflict situations tend- ing inevitably toward their own solution. Fidelity to fact would require that some notion be given of their processual se- quence from de'but to denouement. A complete sequence in love-property conflict would begin with the rivalry phase. It would depict the changing attitudes of the rivals, and of the object and the public, as some are eliminated and one finally wins. The next phase would show the winner in secure pos- session at some level of ownership such as the "sweetheart," the "fiancee," or the "spouse" level. He is no longer jealous because rivalry is finished and no tres- passer is in sight, and the public has an attitude of "don't disturb." The third phase, trespass, would describe the atti- tude of Ego as he becomes aware of an enemy-his attitudes toward the tres- passer, the love object, and the public. It would describe also the attitudes of the trespasser; and since the direction of the sequence hinges largely upon the woman, her attitudes toward lover, rival, and public. If she favors the trespasser and is willing to risk Ego's and the com- munity's wrath, Ego may lose. On the other hand if she does not favor the tres- passer, or if he, himself, is not willing to</page><page sequence="5">THE FAMILY 399 take the risk, or if Ego or the public uses irresistible force, Ego may win. The complexity of attitudes between the four interacting agencies grows amazingly com- plex. Innumerable combinations are pos- sible. To describe them all, though a fascinating adventure into the anatomy of dramatic reality, would require a tome.2 IV Since in love-property the object of possession is the affection of another person we may expect jealousy to have direct bearing upon the sociology of in- timacy. Only when there is a presump- tion of gemeinschaft or primary association in past, present, or future can jealousy, apparently, appear. Yet jealousy signifies at least a partial negation of that rapport between persons which we commonly ascribe to intimacy. It admits that affection has strayed in the direction of a rival. Even where affection has not strayed jealousy shows on the lover's part a mistrust inimical to the harmony of perfect intimacy. What, then, is the function of jealousy with regard to intimate association? As a fear reaction in the initial stages of rivalry it is simply the obverse side of the desire to win the object. The desire to win being institutionally cultivated, the fear of losing is unavoidably stimulated also, though its expression is publicly frowned upon. But after ownership has been attained, jealousy is a fear and rage reaction fitted to protect, maintain, and prolong the intimate association of love. It shelters this personal relationship from outside intrusion. This is not to say that it never defeats its own purpose by over- shooting the mark. So deeply.emotional is jealousy that it appears in the midst of modern social relationships, which are most profitably manipulated by self-com- posed shrewdness, as a bull in a china shop. Nonetheless its intention is pro- tective. It is a denial of gemeinschaft only in so far as its presence admits a breach; and is destructive of it only in so far as it muddles its own purpose. Jealousy stresses two characteristics of gemeinschaft relationship: its ultimate and its personal qualities. The relation- ship is for the jealous person an ultimate end in itself, all other considerations coming secondary. This explains the bizarre crimes so frequently connected with jealousy-crimes understandable only upon the assumption that for the criminal the affection of a particular person is the supreme value in life. It also explains the connection between ex- treme jealousy and romantic love. The "personal" quality of the relationship is manifested by the unwillingness of the jealous person to conceive any substitute for the "one and only." He insists upon the uniqueness of personality. Were the particular person removed, the whole relationship and its accompanying emotion of jealousy would disappear. An old debate poses the question whether or not affection is divisible. Is it possible to love two people sincerely at the same time? Most sexologists answer that it is possible, and cite cases as proof. Iwan Bloch, for example, asserts that simultaneous passion for several persons 2 One attitude that seems dependent upon the stage of conflict is envy. Envy is the attitude not of the owner but of either the public or a potential rival. It implies that a person would like to have a posses- sion that another owns but that he is at the time mak- ing no effort to wrest it away from the owner. It can hardly be present in one's mind at the same time as jealousy, because the latter implies some claim to possession or at least a right to compete. Envy is the obverse side of the desire for the valuables of a community, and since it usually cuts across the insti- tutional distribution it is frowned upon by the group culture.</page><page sequence="6">400 SOCIAL FORCES happens repeatedly.8 He adds that the extensive psychic differentiation between individuals in modern civilization in- creases its likelihood, for it is difficult to find in a single person one's complement. He gives numerous examples from history and literature, particularly cases where one aspect of a person's nature is satisfied by one lover, another aspect (usually the sensual) by a different lover. The conclusion invariably deduced from this is that jealousy is harmful and un- justified. But to end the discussion with this ethical argument is to miss the point. Even though love, like any other dis- tributive value, is divisible, institutions dictate the manner and extent of the division. Where exclusive possession of an individual's entire love is customary, jealousy will demand that exclusiveness. Where love is divided it will be divided according to some scheme, and jealousy will reinforce the division. V While the love-property situation con- tains a relationship of intimacy and throws light upon the sociology of ge- meinschaft association, it also contains a diametrically opposite kind of relation- namely, that of power-which concerns the sociology of dominance and sub- ordination. This relationship, which ob- tains between the lover and his rival or trespasser, is not a value in itself but a means to an ulterior end; and it connotes an absolute opposition of purpose, in the sense that if one succeeds the other fails. The rival or trespasser may be a stranger or a close friend; in either event, so far as the common object is concerned, he is an enemy. Here, as elsewhere in the discussion, it makes a difference whether the enemy is a trespasser or a rival. Rivalry is most acute in the early stages of acquisition, and jealousy is at this point a fear of not win- ning the desired object. Toward one's rival one is supposed to show good sport and courtesy, which is to say that society requires the suppression, in this context, of jealous animosity. Regulated com- petition constitutes the sine qua non of property distribution and hence of stable social organization. But as one person gets ahead and demonstrates a superior claim, his rivals, hiding their feelings of jealous disappointment, must drop away. If any rival persists after the victor has with institutional ritual fortified his claim he is no longer a rival but a tres- passer. Jealousy toward the trespasser is en- couraged rather than suppressed, for it tends to preserve the fundamental institu- tions of property. Uncles in our society are never jealous of the affection of nephews for their father. But uncles in matrilineal societies frequently are, be- cause there is a close tie socially prescribed between uncle and nephew. The neph- ew's respect is the property of the uncle; if it is given to the father (as sometimes happens because of the close association between father and son), the uncle is jealous. Jealousy does not occur in the natural situations-and the "natural sit- uations" are simply those defined in terms of the established institutions. Our ma- lignant emotions, fear, anger, hate, and jealousy, greet any illicit attempt to gain property that we hold. They do not manifest themselves when a licit attempt is made, partly because we do not then have the subjective feeling of "being wronged," and partly because their ex- pression would receive the disapproba- tion of the community. The social func- 3 Sexual Life of Our Time, pp. 2.o6-0o7. Havelock Ellis, Studies in Psych. of Sex, VI, 568-69, agrees. Also Joseph K. Folsom, in his Social Psychology, pp. I54-55.</page><page sequence="7">THE FAMILY 40I tion of jealousy against a trespasser is the extirpation of any obstacle to, the smooth running of the institutional machinery. Discussions of jealousy usually overlook the difference between rivalry and tres- pass. A case in point is the old problem of whether one can be jealous of a person not one's equal. If the person is a tres- passer the answer is that he can be at any social distance away. But if he is a rival he cannot be too far distant. Rivalry implies a certain degree of equality at the start. Each society designates which of its members are eligible to compete for certain properties. While there are some properties for which members of different classes may compete, there are others for which they may not compete. In such cases the thought of competition is in- conceivable, the emotions reserved for a rival fail to appear, and the act is re- garded not as rivalry but as a detestable thrust at the class structure. Thus it happens that for a given lover some people cannot arouse jealousy as of a rival. If the love-object yields to a member of a distinctly inferior social class, jealousy will turn into moral outrage, no matter if the lover himself has no claim on the love-object. It is inconceivable, for this reason, that a Negro could be the rival of a southern white man for the hand of a white girl. The white man would have him lynched. Southern society does not permit Negroes as a class to compete for the affection of white girls. It is almost equally inconceivable that a white man could be a Negro's rival for the hand of a colored girl. The Negro has either too much advantage in the likelihood of social ostracism for the white man, or too little advantage in that the white man, if immune to ostracism, can take the prop- erty by force. But jealousy against a trespasser is another matter. A trespasser being by definition a breaker of customary rules, the more he breaks, including the rules of class structure, the more of a trespasser he is. A violator of property rights may for this reason occupy any position on the social scale. The fact that men of native races some- times prostitute their wives to civilized men without any feeling Qf jealousy, while they are extremely jealous of men of their own race,4 is sometimes pointed out as showing that men are jealous only of their equals. This is true only in so far as jealousy of rivals is meant. The civilized man is not conceived by the natives as a rival, nor as a trespasser. He may be conceived as a trespasser-if, for example, he attempts to retain the wife without paying anything. Yet in the case mentioned he is not a trespasser, but merely one who has legitimately paid for the temporary use of property. His very payment recognizes the property rights of the husband. The following case is much more illustrative: "A Frenchman of posi- tion picks for his mistress a girl who is not his social equal. You can see for your- self that his wife is not jealous. But let him choose a woman of his own social rank-then you'd see the fur fly;..."I Among some social spheres in France, if we are to believe what we hear, women of different classes customarily exercise pro- prietary rights in the same man, and no jealousy is felt. But since it is not cus- tomary for members of the same rank to share a man, such a condition is either rivalry or trespass, and arouses intense jealousy. One may argue that the nearer two people are in every plane, the more in- tense will be the jealousy of rivalry; while 4 Malinowski, Sexual Life of Savages, p. 2-7I. 5 Reported by Ben. B. Lindsey, Companionate Marriage, p. 88.</page><page sequence="8">402. SOCIAL FORCES the further apart they are, the greater the jealousy of trespass. But between the lover and the object of his love the relationship is not one of power. If a woman is regarded simply as a pawn in a game for prestige the pattern is No. 2 in our typology, not No. 4. It is a question of vanity rather than jealousy. In the love situation the jealous person values the affection for itself. It is his fear of losing this intrinsically val- uable affection to a rival or a trespasser, rather than his fear of losing prestige in the eyes of his public and his rival, that paralyzes him. VI Into every affair of love and battle for power steps society. It has an inherent interest in love not only because future generations depend upon it but because social cohesion rests upon the peaceful distribution of major values. A question that all authorities feel com- pelled to settle concerns the social or anti- social character of jealousy. Forel de- clares that jealousy "is only the brutal stupidity of an atavistic heritage, or a pathological symptom,"8 while Havelock Ellis calls it "an anti-social emotion."7 The chief arguments are that it is an in- heritance from animal ancestors, a hin- drance to the emancipation of women, and an obstacle to rational social intercourse. The hasty readiness to praise or con- demn prevents a clear understanding of the relation of jealousy to institutional structure. Careful analysis is cut short by the quick conclusion that jealousy is instinctive, the assumption being that cer- tain stimuli call forth a stereotyped, bio- logically ingrained response. Jealousy is therefore regarded as an animal urge, and since biological nature and sociological nature are assumed to be eternally at odds, jealousy is denounced as anti-social.8 This view fails to analyze jealous be- havior into its different components-to distinguish between the stimulus (with its physical and meaningful aspects) and the physical mechanism of response. It puts all constituents into the undifferentiated category of instinct. Doubtless the physiological mechanism is inherited. But the striking thing about this mechanism is that it is not specific for jealousy, but operates in precisely the same manner in fear and rage. The sympathetic nervous system plays, apparently, the usual r6le: increased adrenal activity speed- ing the heart, increasing the sugar content of the blood, toning up the striated and staying the smooth muscles. If we are to differentiate jealousy from the other strong emotions we must speak not in terms of inherited physiology but in terms of the type of situation which pro- vokes it. The conflict situation always contains a particular content, and the con- tent varies from one culture to the next. The usual mistake in conceiving jealousy is to erect a concrete situation found some- where (often in the culture of the author) into the universal and inherent stimulus to that emotion. This ignores the fact that each culture distributes its sexual property and defines its conflict situations in its own 6 The Sexual Question, pp. II8-II9. 7 Studies in Psychology of Sex, VI, 564. 8 The logic of social ethicists at times becomes badly scrambled. Frequently it is clear that what they call "instinctive" is merely the institutions to which they are habituated and to which they lend their approval. The biological basis of the institu- tions is thus assumed to justify them, for, if a thing is instinctive, like love, it should be given free expres- sion, not suppressed. On the other hand the in- veterate propensity to derive all social phenomena from the genetic qualities of the individual leads the ethicists to infer that certain disapproved behavior, like criminality, war, or jealousy, is also instinctive. In this case the assumption that it is biological be- comes, not a justification, but a reason for condem- nation. It is "atavistic," "barbaric," animal-like."</page><page sequence="9">THE FAMILY 403 way, and that, therefore, the concrete con- tent cannot be regarded as an inherited stimulus to an inherited response. This mistake is made, I think, by those theorists who seek to explain certain hu- man institutions on the basis of instinctive emotions. In the field of sexual institu- tions Westermarck is the outstanding theorist who has relied upon this type of explanation. He disproves the hypothesis of primeval promiscuity and proves the primacy of pair marriage largely on the basis of allegedly innate jealousy. 9 He as- sumes, indeed, that all types of sexual relationship other than monogamy, as he knows it in his own culture, are native stimuli to instinctive jealous retaliation. As soon, however, as we admit that other forms of sexual property exist, and that they do not arouse but instead are pro- tected by jealousy, the explanation of monogamy breaks down. Whether as the obverse side of the desire to obtain sexual property by legitimate competition, or as the anger at having rightful property tres- passed upon, jealousy would seem to bol- ster the institutions where it is found. If these institutions are of an opposite char- acter to monogamy, it bolsters them none- theless. Whereas Westermarck would say that adultery arouses jealousy and that, therefore, jealousy causes monogamy, one could maintain that our institution of mo- nogamy causes adultery to be resented and, therefore, creates jealousy. Had he confined himself to disproving promiscuity instead of going on to prove monogamy, Westermarck would have re- mained on surer ground. Promiscuity im- plies the absence of any sexual property- pattern. Yet sexual affection is, unlike divine grace, a distributive value. To let it go undistributed would introduce an- archy into the group and destroy the social "system." Promiscuity can take place only in so far as society has broken down and reached a state of anomie. The stimulus to jealousy, moreover, is not so much a physical situation as a meaningful one. The same physical act will in one place denote ownership, in an- other place robbery. Westermarck ap- pears to believe that it is the physical act of sexual intercourse between another man and one's wife that instinctively arouses jealousy. But there are cultures where such intercourse merely emphasizes the husband's status as owner, just as lending an automobile presumes and emphasizes one's ownership of it. We may cite, for example, the whole range of institutions whereby, in some manner, the wife is given over to a man other than her husband. These run from those highly ritualized single acts in which a priest or a relative deflowers the wife, to the repeated and more promiscuous acts of sexual hospitality and the more permanent and thorough-going agreements of wife- exchange; not to mention the fixed divi- sion of sexual function represented by poly- andric marriage. In societies where any institution in this range prevails, the be- havior implied does not arouse the feeling of jealousy that similar behavior would arouse in our culture. Jealousy does not respond inherently to any particular situa- tion; it responds to all those situations, no matter how diverse, which signify a viola- tion of accustomed sexual rights. VII Possession of a thing of value without any right to it is a prevalent condition in sexual behavior, affection being evidently difficult to govern. The converse-owner- ship without custody-appears equally prevalent. At least in our culture the in- stances are countless in which there is no overt transgression of convention and yet 9.History of Human Marriage, Ch. 9.</page><page sequence="10">404 SOCIAL FORCES affection has strayed. Wives and hus- bands abound who have little or no affec- tion for their mates, but who would not actually sully the marriage tie. Their af- fection is owned by their mates, but not possessed. Our discussion seems to have associated jealousy exclusively with ownership, with outward conformity, rather than with actual possession. This has not been due to ignorance of possible discrepancy be- tween the two, or to ignorance of the fact that many lovers, especially the romantic variety, profess to care only for the pos- session of affection, and nothing at all for conformity to senseless tradition. It has been due, rather, to a conviction that so- called outward conformity, either through speech or overt behavior, is always the symbol of the inward state. If a woman never, by word or deed, let the fact appear that she did not love her husband, he would never have cause to feel jealous. She must say or do something contrary to a wife's institutionally sanctioned r6le be- fore jealousy will be justified. If she says she loves her husband and yet does things contrary to the mores, such as have inter- course with a prohibited man, actions will be presumed to speak louder than words, and jealousy will be in order. To us who conform outwardly to many meaningless and secretly detested conven- tions, and perform an even greater number of routine technological acts which try our patience, a close correspondence between inner feeling and external act seems ques- tionable. Yet if we analyze the less con- spicuous because less conscious aspects of our behavior, we find the correspondence frequently quite close. In situations where we are supposed to feel ashamed, we feel ashamed-and prove it by our out- ward embarrassment. In situations where we are supposed to show respect, we usu- ally feel respect. In only a few civiliza- tions is the distinction between external act and internal feeling sharply realized, and even then they are not far apart. In any case action which conforms to the institutions of property is the symbol of genuine possession, and contrary action the symbol of lack of possession. It is true that conformity at any particu- lar time may be a deception, but the decep- tion is hardly significant unless it manifests itself at some time in non-conformist out- ward behavior. Whether or not it is a deception depends, of course, upon the internal state, which is the motivating fac- tor. So the aim of the lover is always to control the inner state of affection, not simply to enforce a present conformity which guarantees nothing concerning future behavior. This in spite of the fact that his only clue is the loved one's out- ward conformity or non-conformity. Unless through each stage of progressive ownership actual possession also pro- gresses, inconvenience will result. A girl who becomes engaged to a man without caring for him and without intending to marry him is in an uncomfortable position. She cannot complain if her fiance's legiti- mate jealousy and the public's interest in moral:ity restrict her action&amp;. She knows that when she breaks her engagement she must have a good excuse wherewith to avoid social censure. At all times she is constrained to feign an affection she does not feel. On the whole the inconvenience of a hiatus between real feeling and institu- tional status is in this case greater than the advantage. Moreover, most girls are trained to think of such a thing as not only unwise but also unfair and immoral. In this way ownership tends to approximate genuine possession. VIII Unfortunately our treatment has been couched entirely in terms of the stable and</page><page sequence="11">THE FAMILY 405 integrated culture, and there is not space to treat the complications arising when society has reached a state of anomie. As the institutions of property in general dis- integrate, sexual property follows suit. In extreme cases, apparently, ownership may disappear and be replaced entirely by sheer possession. Juxtaposition of contrary mores and rapid change have given our culture a cer- tain amount of anomie, which is reflected in the emotions surrounding the distribu- tion of sexual favor. None of our sexual institutions is sanctioned by all groups. Consequently, no matter how customary the sexual behavior, somebody can be found who is made jealous by it. For example, those who are not used to danc- ing and who disapprove of it are apt to grow extremely jealous if a wife or sweet- heart indulges. This, coupled with other traits such as our individualism and ro- manticism, has tended, in the eyes of our intelligentsia, to give jealousy a negative value. Yet among the juries of the land the "unwritten law" is still a sanctioned reality.</page></plain_text>
