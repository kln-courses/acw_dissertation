<plain_text><page sequence="1">Designs on Indonesia's Muslim Communities KENNETH M. GEORGE ON OCTOBER 15, 1991, HAJI MUHAMMAD SOEHARTO, President of Indonesia, became the first official calligrapher for the Al-Qur'an Mushaf Istiqlal-The National Independence Illuminated Qur'an-by inking in the initial letter of the Basmallah in the opening sura (Al-Fatihah, the prologue; see Fig. 1). Four years later, just after commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of Indonesian independence, he put the finishing touch to the closing sura of the Qur'an (An-Naas, or "Humanity," Sura 114), signed the completed manuscript, and presented it to the people of Indonesia and to the Muslim world community. Although he is adept at using or reciting the Qur'anic Arabic needed for daily prayer, the profession of faith, and the verbal exchanges that bond Muslims with each other, Soeharto is a decidedly unpracticed calligrapher when it comes to Arabic orthography. On both occasions, his hand merely followed the lines of the Naskhi-style script prepared by a team of artists, designers, calligraphers, and Qur'anic authorities. In this way, Soeharto was figured into the material Kenneth M.

GEORGE production and social legitimation of the national mushaf. I As signatory and Indonesia's president, he gave the mushaf a seal of approval and legitimacy; as calligrapher, he yielded to artistic and religious authorities, and so let others write through him, and for him. I mention the ironies and effects of Soeharto's hand in order to begin a set of remarks about the cultural and political work behind the Mushaf Istiqlal, reckoned not only as a textual and religious object worthy of national pride, but as a civic and artistic project in which national futures and national pasts could be given a Muslim character. Soeharto no doubt had certain political ends in mind when lending his authority to the mushaf project. And, indeed, he cast a powerful shadow on the making of this religious text. But as I have already hinted, he was not the only authority behind the mushaf. Other Indonesian Muslim subjects took part in this project and brought with them their own political, cultural, and religious agendas. A look at the Mushaf Istiqlal project, then, can suggest some of the ways in which the state and its citizen subjects might imagine and objectify religion, politics, and culture within the public sphere. The Indonesian case is especially striking because state discourse often promotes a radical, if illusory, separation of the political and the cultural, a separation used to manipulate political expression and party politics, to secure the ascendant distribution of power, and to undercut the political implications of cultural critique (cf. Geertz 1990; Pemberton 1994; Yampolsky 1995). Contemporary anthropologies acknowledge no such separation: cultural work always _l-ju Figure 1.

But Soeharto's New Order consistently seeks to deny or put a check to the political and ideological aspects of domains objectified as culture-especially art, literature, and adat-even while using these domains to legitimate or expand state rule. As Clifford Geertz put it several years ago, the Soeharto government tries to make ideology "look like art without art being made to look like ideology" (1990, 79). It seems to me, too, that we have a special need to look into such projects, for religion, nationalism and national culture, and the identity politics that attach to them are especially prominent within the public spheres in which Muslim communities play a dominant or vocal role. As Dale Eickelman and James Piscatori recently have pointed out, much of what counts as Muslim politics is the effort to control the institutions, discourse, and interpretive gambits that constitute Islamic faith, identity, and practice (1996, 5-2 1). Islam, in this view, is not a generic essence with fixed relations to nationalism, the nation-state, or national culture. Rather it is more like the religious entity envisioned by Mohammed Arkoun (1994) or Aziz Al- Azmeh (1993)-a heterogeneous social imaginary "that conjoins, by means of a name, a variety of societies, cultures, histories, and polities" (Al-Azmeh 1993, 60). The mushaf project is no less important for the light it can shed on political, religious, and cultural authorities in the Indonesian Muslim ummat (or "Islamic community") and the Indonesian public sphere. The ulama, or religious scholars, have wielded enormous authority in the past; today they are joined by Muslim intellectuals and artists in determining the place of Islam in Indonesia's civil society. These figures do not always act in concert, nor do they stand in fixed relation to state authorities; debates and differences between them reflect diverse efforts to come to terms with the Soeharto regime, Indonesia's religious pluralism, and the expanding influence of middle-class interests and moral sentiments. I call special attention to the artists, for our understanding of their influence and practice "in public" has been somewhat muted by a Habermasian emphasis on literary culture, rational-critical debate, and the singularity of "the" public sphere (Calhoun 1992, 1995; Habermas 1989; Lee 1993). In his account of the rise of a liberal, bourgeois public sphere in Europe, Jiirgen Habermas underscores the effects of literary salons and coffee houses in establishing the structural ideals that led to social parity or sameness between citizens of otherwise disparate identity, and that fostered rational- critical discussion of the political concerns shared by this public. In idealizing a unitary and egalitarian public sphere, Habermas brackets out social difference and hierarchy, and ignores the way in which multiple and contrastive publics intersect or collide in their bid for legitimacy and authority. At the same time, he positions the reader/critic as the paradigmatic citizen in the liberal public sphere. As for the subsequent transformation of the public sphere in the twentieth century, Habermas identifies mass media, publicity, and spectacle as the forms that drive the culture- consuming public that has significantly displaced the culture-debating publics of earlier periods. There is good reason to include the visual arts and artists in the rise of the European bourgeois public sphere (see, for example, Crow 1985). But with respect to the national and transnational publics that have emerged throughout postcolonial Asia, their role seems especially significant and worthy of acknowledgment. Artists play an instrumental role in promoting ideas about culture and modernity and establishing institutional locations for the display of works that will undergo a continuous socialization by a culture-consuming public or publics. This places them at the heart of national and transnational cultural politics and so positions them as</page><page sequence="4">696 KENNETH M. GEORGE key figures in efforts to identify and control emergent or residual publics. In this paper, I obviously have a Muslim art public in mind, that is, a public that would look upon art as a Muslim concern, and that would view itself as an art-producing constituency. In the case at hand, the artisanal features of the Mushaf Istiqlal-its illuminations, its calligraphy, the quality and size of the paper on which the sura were inscribed, and, most crucially, the manner in which it was put on exhibit-demanded that this edition of the Qur'an be apprehended as art. I would argue that the artists behind the mushaf project engaged not only in making an aesthetic object, but also in convening an Indonesian Muslim art public with themselves at its center. And as I will explain later in this paper, the artisanal horizons within which the mushaf was produced and displayed would include efforts to inscribe that social body as a recognizable presence within the designed object itself. That is to say, the mushaf and its artwork render an image of an Indonesian Muslim art public. In short, the Mushaf Istiqlal project has encompassed the political, cultural, and religious aspirations of various Indonesian Muslim subjects-some aligned principally with the state, others looking outward to the transnational "living space of Islam" (darul Islam; also, dar al-Islam), some devoted to Muslim religious precedent (or taklid), and still others inclined to the innovative impulse of international modernist aesthetics. I believe it speaks volumes about a state-sponsored effort to consolidate and manage a pluralistic public sphere in which national culture and national futures will be linked to Muslim interests and identity politics. And on a comparative note, this kind of civic and cultural project can be of real relevance to our understanding of religion and art as constituent features of the public sphere. Some Background Indonesia is home to roughly 165 million Muslims; in such numbers they not only predominate in that country's civic life-they constitute 88 percent of the public-but also make up the largest ummat within existing national borders anywhere in the world (Taher 1995). The roots of Islamization in island Southeast Asia go back at least as far as the eleventh century, and include diverse strains of religious, political, and cultural thought. Indonesian Islams-I use the plural to momentarily underscore diversity where others might wish to emphasize unity-have been mediated by a complex history of political and ethnic encounters. Traffic with South Asia, China, Persia, Turkey, and the Arab world plays a crucial role here, as does the movement of Islamic ideas and practices across ethnic and linguistic groups within the archipelago itself. Generally speaking, most of the Indonesian Muslim ummat adheres to Sunni doctrine. The Sufic tarekat, or mystical brotherhoods, remain influential and traditionalist outlook and loyalties to the ulama are considerable; but a vast and growing number of Indonesian Muslims have steeped themselves in modernist and reformist approaches that underscore ijtihad, or individual interpretation of Qur'anic teachings. Muslims were, of course, the predominant figures in founding the Republic of Indonesia, its constitution, its bureaucratic and jural institutions, and its culture of governance. Yet, Indonesia is in no sense a theocratic Islamic state; rather, its institutions and its nationalist state ideology promote the exercise of Islamic faith and shari'a law, while blunting the possibilities for religiously based political critique. For some Indonesian Muslims this is satisfactory; for others, it is not. As the recent work of John Bowen (1993), Suzanne Brenner (1996), Robert</page><page sequence="5">DESIGNS ON INDONESIA'S MUSLIM COMMUNITIES 697 Hefner (1993), Bambang Pranowo (1990), Anthony Reid (1993), and others has made clear, the Indonesian Muslim ummat does not have a fixed or unified view about the state or about political order more generally. In fact, the character of civil society and the state, and their relationship to Islam is a persistent point of debate and political concern within the Muslim ummat-just as it is within the Soeharto government. To offer further background to my discussion, I should remind readers that Soeharto's government-which is called the New Order, and which has been in place for over thirty years-has relied on authoritarian rule in pursuing political stability, economic growth, and the security of the state. In contrast to the interest in nation- building and national identity that marked the first twenty years of independence under Sukarno, Soeharto's New Order has been preoccupied with expanding state power into Indonesian society (Anderson 1990; van Langenberg 1990). Many instruments of state power were, of course, well in place by the end of the Sukarno period. But as Benedict Anderson has remarked, the "New Order is best understood as the resurrection of the state and its triumph vis-a-vis society and nation" (1990, 109). In these circumstances, state policies toward civil society and public culture have had an enormous impact on the way in which the Indonesian Muslim ummat constitutes itself as a social and political body (cf. Jones 1984; Mahasin 1985; Wahid 1985). How the ummat defines itself, how it expands or contracts, or how it accommodates a plurality of internal differences are never just matters of local reaction to national politics, but are questions also informed by events within a global darul Islam. Nonetheless, the entanglements of state and ummat should not be minimized by an awareness of hybrid social formations lying beyond the scope of the nation- state. As I see it, the state and Islam are so prominent in shaping Indonesia's civil energies and public culture that we should be careful in the way we use familiar terms like "civil society" and the "public sphere" (cf. Bowen 1993; Schmit 1996). As it has been portrayed in much of the social scientific literature, civil society is that public and private collectivity of groups, organizations, and individuals that emerges independently of the state, to mediate relationships between citizens and state authorities (Hann 1996). Similarly, the public sphere, in Habermas's principal formulation (1989), is the cultural and discursive correlate of civil society, a sphere in which "private people come together as a public" to discuss and scrutinize social, cultural, and political concerns that emerge under state rule. The literature associates both civil society and the public sphere with the rise of market economies that function outside of the state sphere. In this sense, Indonesia has at best a nascent civil society; the state has long been deeply involved in controlling the market and has only recently decentralized the economy to allow broader economic participation (Schmit 1996). Authoritarian state rule that demands special permissions for meetings of more than five people (Heryanto 1990, 297), makes a Western liberal version of the public sphere-where citizens enjoy the relatively free exchange of ideas-an impossibility. We should recall, however, that Habermas (1989) allows for various kinds of public spheres, as well as their structural transformation by historical forces. Different kinds of public spheres may exist in different sociohistorical circumstances, and no one model will be sufficient to capture them. In Indonesia, the state still requires a social and cultural arena to summon individual citizens together for the staged displays that will direct or forestall public debate. Nor does authoritarian rule eliminate all possibility for discussing public life. Here is where religion may come</page><page sequence="6">698 KENNETH M. GEORGE in. As John Bowen has detailed in his ethnographic work with the Muslim Gayo of Sumatra, Islamic schools and religious celebrations "have provided relatively open- ended institutional and cultural frameworks for scrutinizing contemporary social arrangements" and negotiating political loyalties (1993, 326). In short, the Indonesian case affords a chance to broaden our understanding of the public sphere, most particularly with regard to the engagement between religion and the state. The State and the Ummat As so many Indonesianists have noted (Adnan 1990; Bowen 1993; Brenner 1996; Budiman 1990; Hefner 1987, 1993; Liddle 1996; Tamara 1986), the New Order regime has consistently acted to put a check to Islamic political activists and organizations and to thwart any visions of an Indonesian Islamic state, a vision that was at the root of political turmoil and rebellion in the early postrevolution period. Activism has been subverted-witness the tactics brought to bear on Muslim groups prior to the recent 1997 elections-and the response to religious militancy has been harsh. Nonetheless, the regime has accorded the Indonesian Muslim community the opportunity to pursue its cultural and religious activities, including programs of religious proselytization known as dakwah, so long as such activities did not take or excite an explicit political turn against the government. In fact, the government has courted the favor of the Muslim ummat in various ways: Support for Islamic courts and family law has been assured; prohibitions against interfaith marriage have been set in place; Muslim development banks have received clearance; and Soeharto himself made the pilgrimage to Mecca for the first time in 1990. Still, Muslim political parties, once representing diverse aspirations, ideas, and loyalties, have been collapsed into one, the United Development Party (Partai Persatuan Pembangunan, PPP), whose leadership cannot effectively challenge the current government. By the mid-1980s, the regime was in the position to persuade or pressure all social and political organizations, including Muslim ones, into acknowledging Pancasila, the nationalist state ideology, as their sole foundation. At the same time, the government took steps to foster a "state-controlled form of Islam" by funding religious education, mosques, and prayer-houses in which progovernment publicity could be disseminated within the rubric of spiritual development (Bowen 1993, 329; cf. Hefner 1987). The government's effort to depoliticize Islam provided the backdrop to shifts in thinking within the Muslim ummat during the 1970s and 1980s. The growth of urban upper and middle classes with improved access to Islamic education led to an expanded and more broadly modernist Muslim population. Meanwhile, prominent modernist intellectuals like Nurcholish Madjid and Abdurrahman Wahid argued that an Islamic society did not necessitate an Islamic political party or an Islamic state, a view quite welcome in government circles. Stirred by these intellectuals and consistently faced with the suppression of Muslim political activity, many of the younger and university-educated members of the ummat turned away from formal politics and began to cultivate social, cultural, and religious activities that would put Muslim values at the heart of national civic life, most especially as lived by the urban and middle class. As a consequence, what has taken place during the last fifteen years is a dramatic turn toward everyday piety in the home, on the street, in schools, in businesses, and in government offices. Emblems of pious thought and conduct have become the signs for a modern Indonesian Muslim subject as well as markers of</page><page sequence="7">DESIGNS ON INDONESIA'S MUSLIM COMMUNITIES 699 distinction and taste for members of a progressive and rising social class. Linked to the processes of commodification and mass mediation that characterize late capitalism, such emblems even accrue and display something of the social magic critics associate with fetishization in the culture industry (Pietz 1996). A very relevant example of how the state has become connected with the deepening Islamization of Indonesia is the founding of ICMI (Ikatan Cendekiawan Muslim Se-Indonesia), the Association of Indonesian Muslim Intellectuals. John Bowen sees in ICMI a government attempt to "create a formal sphere of Islamic scholars that would operate outside the state" (1993, 329)-though he downplays the fact that the membership is made up significantly of Muslim bureaucrats and is headed by H. B. J. Habibie, the former State Minister of Research and Technology (now vice- president). Similarly, acquaintances of mine within this government-endorsed organization see it as an arena for fostering religious debate and reflection, and for building moral discipline within government circles. But the regime clearly has some political purposes in mind. Discussing Soeharto's hand in the birth of this organization in 1991, Robert Hefner has shrewdly portrayed the president's public engagement with Islam as a "struggle to capture and direct the moral allegiances of [an) urban middle class" that has embraced this religion as their key source of ethical and spiritual guidance (1993, 2). William Liddle takes a starker view, arguing that "ICMI is not an autonomous organization representing the political interests of the Muslim community to the government. Rather it is a state corporatist organization, dominated by high officials beholden to President Soeharto" and designed to advance his control of the political system through the 1997 elections and 1998, when the People's Consultative Assembly (Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat) will have selected the country's president (Liddle 1996, 625). The picture I wish to give of the Indonesian public sphere, then, shows a thorough, if uneasy and contestatory, interpenetration of Muslim and state interests. Liddle sounds an exceptionally bleak note about the public sphere; he writes that the New Order government's authoritarianism has deeply affected the formation and expression of Muslim values, beliefs, and attitudes. Islamic politics since the late 1960's has been so repressed, distorted, and channeled that it is no longer possible to know which views enjoy broad mass support and which do not. Indeed, in the absence of open political organization and debate, most ordinary, nonactivist Indonesian Muslims probably do not have well-defined positions on many issues affecting their lives. (Liddle 1996, 631) On the matter of politics and political participation, I largely would agree with Liddle. Yet I think Liddle's summary comment could do much more to acknowledge some key transformations in the Indonesian Muslim public sphere, especially when it comes to other forms of cultural work and practice. First of all, it seems to me that state intrusion has formally expanded the role of Muslim intellectuals and given them an authority and influence ordinarily enjoyed by the ulamas and other Muslim clerics in discussions of social, cultural, and religious life. Second, the state has also inserted itself into the public sphere as a religious authority of sorts: it offers judgments upon and legitimations of the role of religion in civic affairs and the daily life of citizens. Next, Liddle does not acknowledge the global dimensions of darul Islam-the worldwide living space of Islam-that are now cultivated through publications, television, radio, videocassettes, and the world wide web, not to mention the</page><page sequence="8">700 KENNETH M. GEORGE experience of the haj. The Indonesian Muslim public sphere is not limited to the communities within national borders. Like all public spheres, it is porous, and, indeed, Indonesian Muslims think of themselves not only as Indonesian citizens, but also as believers who belong to and draw ideas from the transnational community of darul Islam. On another point, and one I hope to exploit in the remainder of this paper, Liddle overlooks the ways in which individual citizen-subjects, or groups of citizen-subjects, take advantage of the state-dominated public sphere for their own social, cultural, or religious ends (cf. Ortner 1995). Collaborations with the state in the public sphere may of course end in co-opted projects, and usually do. Yet they may also include improvisations, opportunities, evasions, and manipulations that make authoritarian political systems livable. Seen in this light, Muslim cultural production in the Indonesian public sphere is perhaps always concerned with finding "room for maneuver" (Chambers 1991) between co-optation and resistance. Cultural Production in the Muslim Public Sphere The depoliticization of the Islamic public sphere, and the national public sphere more broadly, has been accompanied by an alert interest in culture and the arts. From the vantage point of the young Indonesian nation-state, a national culture, distinct from and more than the sum of regional or local cultures, needs to be forged. As ethnomusicologist Philip Yampolsky recently observed in his research on the cultural policies of the Indonesian government, national culture is treated as a fundamental vehicle for expanding state ideology and development goals, and for this reason it is "supervised at every turn by the government" (1995, 708; cf. Foulcher 1990). Committed to the guided development of national cultural life, the government (by way of the Department of Education and Culture) has been instrumental in setting up museums, academies, cultural centers, urban art councils, festivals, public competitions, conferences, shows, and tours. In this sense, the government functions as the most significant promoter and patron of the arts in the public sphere, and has established the dominant institutional contexts for artistic activity. It is in these contexts that making art and putting culture "on stage" gain legitimacy and pragmatic outlet. It is here that art and culture are brought into line with cultural policy and state ideology, depoliticized, and subjected to what Yampolsky calls an "aesthetic of respectability," an aesthetic that demands that art be "neat and orderly, disciplined, inoffensive, attractive or impressive to look at," and "in step with the times" (1995, 712). Given the growth of modernist Islam in Indonesian society, the depoliticization of the Muslim ummat, and the promotion of arts and culture in the public sphere more generally, it should come as no surprise that there has been a reawakened interest in Muslim culture among intellectuals, artists, and members of the culture-consuming middle and elite classes. For example, an appreciation for Muslim culture has been articulated with particular effect by the Indonesian historian Kuntowijoyo (1991, 228-38). For Kuntowijoyo, Islamic culture already thrived as Indonesia's popular culture and could be harnessed to democratization and the shaping of a modern Indonesian Islam. Others take a somewhat different view, though one no less indebted to a form of cultural nationalism (Hutchinson 1994). They emphasize past and present</page><page sequence="9">DESIGNS ON INDONESIA'S MUSLIM COMMUNITIES 701 moments of Muslim cultural splendor, rather than popular or religious folk arts. Very broadly, then, Kuntowijoyo and others, despite differences of approach, have been making an effort to reclaim the nation's past and future as Muslim. Although Kuntowijoyo views Islamic culture as a means for subverting authoritarian bureaucracy and the political elite, the Soeharto government seems to have seen it as a way to curry support in the Muslim community. Indeed, I think this matter is clearly behind Soeharto's interest in the production and display of the Mushaf Istiqlal. His hand in the mushaf project has been but one more gesture, indeed, one more maneuver, to acknowledge and seek political advantage in the ongoing Islamization of Indonesian society and the Indonesian public sphere. At the same time, the government's involvement affords it a way to control the production of Muslim arts and culture so as to assure their respectability, their modernity, and their lack of explicit political content. The Mushaf Project It is here that I can begin to detail some of the cultural politics behind the Mushaf Istiqlal project. My familiarity with the project stems from my ongoing collaboration with Abdul Djalil Pirous, one of Indonesia's most distinguished, influential, and commercially successful senior painters, an internationally recognized pioneer in contemporary Indonesian Muslim art, and former Dean of the Faculty of Fine Arts and Design at the Bandung Institute of Technology.2 Best known for his paintings that combine Qur'anic calligraphy (in Arabic and Jawi) with modernist abstract aesthetics, Pirous has had a lifelong involvement in Muslim art. Learning Muslim decorative and graphic arts from his mother and brother in his home province of Aceh, Pirous went on to pursue formal Western-style art training under the direction of Dutch cubist Ries Mulder at the Bandung Institute of Technology in 1955. His principal training took place at this academy, and it is there during the 1970s that he emerged, along with Ahmad Sadali, Abay Subarna, and others with a distinctly modernist, international, and Muslim vision of art. In addition to his success as a painter, he has taught Islamic art history at the Bandung Institute of Technology, overseen mosque restorations, and helped produce a national Qur'anic arts contest in Aceh. Internationally, he has exhibited in the ASEAN nations, Japan, Korea, Bahrain, Jordan, several places in Europe, and in the United States. With respect to the national scene, he is featured as spokesman for the arts in magazines and newspapers, and by virtue of his academic position, serves as an expert on art within government circles. That high academic position also obliges him to cooperate with Golkar, the government-sponsored political body, as a functionary and supporter. It was Pirous and his circle of colleagues at Bandung who first envisioned the mushaf project as part of an Islamic arts festival they were planning to hold in October 1991 at Jakarta's Istiqlal Mosque, in conjunction with Visit Indonesia Year events. Plans for the first Istiqlal Festival emerged from discussions with the Ministers of Tourism, of Religion, and of Education and Culture, and were brought to fruition by the patronage of Soeharto and Jakarta businessman Pontjo Sutowo. As Pirous remarked to me in 1994, the political climate prior to 1990 was such that a festival of this kind 2More extensive commentaries on Pirous's life and work can be found in: Buchari and Yuliman (1985); George (1997); Spanjaard (1988, 1990); and Wright (1994).</page><page sequence="10">702 KENNETH M. GEORGE was scarcely imaginable. Nothing, then, prepared Pirous, or his government and corporate sponsors, for the success of the month-long festival, which drew an estimated 6.5 million visitors. When it came time to hold the second festival in 1995 in conjunction with the fiftieth anniversary celebrations of national independence, there was a rush from the Jakarta elite to support or associate themselves with the exhibition. Soeharto shrewdly reworked the discourse of the first Istiqlal Festival from the start. Some months before the festival, Pirous and the other organizers had a personal audience with Soeharto, and proudly showed off their promotional materials. These materials-printed in Indonesian and English versions-announced a "Festival of Islamic Art in Indonesia." Soeharto nixed the publicity campaign. If the festival was to have his sponsorship, it would have to be promoted as Pesta Kebudayaan Indonesia yang Bernafaskan Islam, a "Festival of Indonesian Culture Inspired by Islam." Soeharto was requiring of Pirous and his circle that their project display an allegiance to an Indonesian national culture. Nationalist aspirations and sensibilities had to precede and be served by religious ones. With this decision, then, Soeharto put a check to those who would display or understand Muslim culture as something outside the orbit of the state and nation. At the same time, the festival would serve to acknowledge publicly the role of Islamic faith in the making of the nation. As powerful as it was, Soeharto's grip on the festival was less than total. For example, in the special festival symposium on "Islam and Indonesian Culture," writer Taufik Abdullah (1993) openly noted that the New Order government of Soeharto was recruiting Muslim artists and intellectuals in the political restructuring of the public sphere under state expansion. He then mused that the festival might possibly release Islamic intellectual thinking from certain "psychological and structural obstacles," even while showing that Islam was intrinsic to traditional and modern Indonesian culture (1993, xxxiii). The first Istiqlal Festival brought together artists, performers, and religious authorities from around the country to the Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta, the largest mosque in all of Southeast Asia. The program included competitions in Qur'anic recitations and calligraphy; fashion shows; dance performances; an exhibit of contemporary Muslim painting; a gallery of traditional and modern mosque architecture; material folk culture (weaving, carving); religious ceremonies; and the mushaf project. Sholat prayers at lohor and magrib, at noon and sunset, punctuated festival activities by bringing gallery doors closed until obligatory religious observances were complete. Congruent with the aesthetic of respectability noted by Yampolsky, the festival was careful to inculcate an appreciation for traditional and modern arts that were suitable to a progress-oriented, national Muslim culture. Further, it underscored the way in which participation in religiously inspired arts could serve as an exercise in piety or dhikir (remembrance of Allah); art was shown to be a Muslim concern. By the same token, religious practices and objects were revealed as things of beauty and creativity, and worthy of aesthetic reflection. In connection, the festival also brought across the idea that the arts did not have to be radically sequestered from places or scenes of worship. Indeed, there had been debate and anxiety among some Muslim authorities about the propriety of running an arts festival at a place of worship. Pirous and the organizers responded that markets and bazaars had often been erected next to mosques in the Middle East; they simply made sure the mosque proper was free of festival activity, and that all exhibitions and festival crowds were kept from intruding into the sacred space of prayer. My own work with Pirous began shortly after the first Istiqlal Festival; I would later sit in on planning meetings for the second Istiqlal Festival during 1994, and attend the festival in its opening week in Jakarta in September 1995 (see Fig. 2). My</page><page sequence="11">DESIGNS ON INDONESIA'S MUSLIM COMMUNITIES 703 special interest in the mushaf project has much to do with centrality of this text in the 1995 festival. Indeed, it attracted the greatest fanfare and publicity, occupying the central exhibitionary space of the second festival. Very basically, the making of the Al-Qur'an Mushaf Istiqlal was to culminate in an artfully rendered textual object with the compound revelatory function of disclosing both the nation and the sacred. I should explain again, at this point, that a mushaf is a written incarnation of the official closed corpus of the Qur'an. It must be written in Arabic and be authenticated and inspected for errors by scriptural authorities who in Indonesia are organized as the Lajnah Pentashih. It does not include a tafsiran, that is, an interpretation in another language, within its pages. Artful calligraphic styles and deeply textured illuminations are common features thought to bring the revelatory manuscript greater grandeur. In making the mushaf, Pirous and his team of graphic designers were not in the position to exercise what the Muslim scholarly tradition calls ijtihad, independent Jakarta,. Indonesia- Figure 2.

For example, the Lajnah Pentashih and the Majelis Ulama Indonesia (the Indonesian Council of Ulamas) objected to what they deemed as innovations with respect to page layout and the placement of verse and recitation markers. Shown precedents from mushaf traditions elsewhere in the Muslim world-in fact, Pirous and his team had gone abroad to examine mushafs in Turkish, Jordanian, Egyptian, and European collections-these authorities firmly responded that such design choices were unfamiliar to Indonesians and would be rejected by the Indonesian ummat. In the end, the clerics and scholars prevailed, and it was agreed that the mushaf page would consist of no more than thirteen lines, be written in the cursive Naskhi calligraphic style, and contain verse and recitation markers that followed popular convention. Each page would be framed by an illuminated border, generated by computer, but painted by hand. Faced with the task of producing a distinctly national Qur'an, the design team chose the border illuminations as the means to make an icon of Muslim Indonesian society, an icon, according to design coordinator Mahmud Buchari, that would render this imagined community as "united and peaceful in its ethnic plurality" (1994, 6). Design concerns, so conceived, evaded or overlooked ideological and class-based diversity within the ummat. Internal social difference was portrayed as a nonhierarchical spectrum of ethnic or regional distinctions, and so deflected attention away from the problems of class and the distribution of political power in Indonesia (cf. Kipp 1993). What is perhaps most interesting and significant here is that the regional decorative art that became the basis for the manuscript's illuminations did not so much depict Indonesia's ethnic diversity as offer a way for regional Muslim communities to imagine themselves as a consolidated art-producing public. Let me explain. Consonant with a Muslim art tradition that usually avoids anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures, the design team searched out geometric and floral patterns commonly used to decorate adat houses, textiles, furniture, and tools. Equipped with computer-assisted design (CAD) stations, the team "morphed" and regenerated the patterns so as to create an illuminated border for each page. Behind this effort was a conviction that Indonesia consisted of distinct "culture areas" (wilayah budaya), each with its own "local genius" that was manifest in the kinds of cultural objects and patterns said to be traditional. The same essentializing and objectifying tactics informed the metonymic alchemy that would convert these objects and patterns into the emblems of a distinctly situated social identity. Peculiar to the project, however, was the kind of Muslim culture areas it evoked. By and large, the Indonesian government conjures the country's cultural diversity on the basis of province or of ethnic group. The former approach yields twenty-seven culture areas; the latter, areas numbering up to a hundred and more, depending upon how the regional ethnographic canon is followed. Provincial cultural arts, as one might expect, sort themselves rather easily according to administratively determined borders, although there are always the problems of border crossings and what essentializing discourses will make of them. Ethnic determinations can be murkier, complicated as they are by the shifting terms and histories upon which ethnic identity is claimed. In contrast to the strict provincial or ethnic lineups, the mushaf team carved up the nation into forty-two Muslim culture and design areas (see Table 1). Most appeared to be based on provincial lines, and included provinces and occupied territories rarely appreciated as places with distinct Muslim cultures-North Bali, Irian Jaya, and East</page><page sequence="13">DESIGNS ON INDONESIA'S MUSLIM COMMUNITIES 705 Table 1.

Timor.3 Furthermore, special discriminations were applied to multiply the number of culture areas to be found in Sumatra and West Java-a move that reflected the designers' familiarity with their homelands in Aceh, North Sumatra, and Sunda, and that offset their rather sketchy knowledge of Islamic culture in Eastern Indonesia, a region with rather significant and vocal Christian communities. Initial plans called for the mushaf to be divided up into segments of twenty-two pages, each segment to be devoted exclusively to the designs of one cultural area. Designs from Aceh- Pirous's place of birth-would grace the opening and closing suras (see Fig. 3). Early planning also called for numerological features, such that the numbers 8, 17, and 45, representing the date of Indonesian independence, would be manifest in the segmentation of the mushaf. The particular choice of Muslim culture regions also came as the result of two deeply felt convictions on the part of the design team. The first had to do with their ideas about national inclusiveness. Intended as a visual and textual image of the nation, the mushaf had to include a representational space for all Indonesian Muslims. Not to have included designs from all the nation's provinces would have amounted to a "scriptural" error of real political consequence. In this sense, the design team functioned much like the Lajnah Pentashih, making sure that the mushaf was error- free. A second motivation behind the choice of culture areas had to do with the team's exasperation over Java's dominance in the national cultural scene, an exasperation perhaps tinged with a modernist suspicion of the syncretic and mystical strains said to characterize traditional Javanese Islam. Although they acknowledged the historical 3A few regional specialists who have heard this paper express strong misgivings about a Muslim project that would represent such predominantly non-Muslim territories as Bali, Irian Jaya, and East Timor as part of an Indonesian darul Islam. The appropriation of designs from these regions into the mushaf indeed requires a political view that ignores non-Muslim coun- terpublics in each region. Those religious counterpublics are uneasy about such threats to their territorialized identities and political status. A defensiveness on behalf of such groups is un- derstandable and at times warranted, yet in such protestations I continue to note a stubbornly rooted anti-Muslim outlook that regards Islam as a sinister and monolithic ideology.</page><page sequence="14">706 KENNETH M. GEORGE and contemporary significance of Javanese Muslim communities in their selection of culture areas (by designating seven such regions in East and Central Java), the team was very deliberate in celebrating designs from the Muslim Malay ("Melayu") communities of Sumatra. Indeed, for most non-Javanese, entering Islam (masuk Islam) has long been synonymous with "becoming Malay" (masuk Melayu). In this respect, the design team made a determined effort at putting a check to Javanese preeminence in Indonesia's Muslim cultural sphere and at reasserting a continuity between national culture and Muslim Malay antecedents. The selection of five areas from Aceh-the Sumatran sultanate long known as Serambi Mekah or the "Porch of Mecca"-is wholly consonant with this strategy of counterbalancing Java's cultural presence with representations of Melayu culture. The designers took the view, then, that these source materials, as territorialized emblems of past sociality and cultural activity, offered an Indonesian foundation to the mushaf.

Assenting for a moment to the designers' ideas about local genius, we see that the source materials also gave them some way to include anonymous Muslim folk artists within the production of the Qur'an, and in that sense broadened its creative base to national scope. Muslim folk artists, of course, do have names, and so this appropriation of their designs presupposed an anonymity at the cost of effacing signature work. Reworking the materials with CAD technologies and placing them within the mushaf counted in some respects as a deliberate artistic refinement of "raw" designs. That is to say, it was the team of academy-trained artists and designers who not only transposed the design material from the surfaces of concrete objects to the printed page, but also made the designs neat, elegant, and "in step with the times." For these reasons, I see in the mushaf an artisanal allegory of the social transformations going on in Indonesian society: The Islamization of folk designs and their concomitant transformation by artists and CAD technicians underscore the way in which Islamization and modernization have become linked social forces in Indonesia. Festival goers can see themselves figured into the national mushaf as a republic of art-producing Muslim communities that was itself modernizing and making itself anew. A team of seventy Muslim scribes and designers worked on the mushaf for a period of three years before displaying it in final form at the second Istiqlal Festival. It eventually comprised 970 pages, each measuring 123 x 88 centimeters, and contained forty-five illumination types (forty-two cultural areas plus three mixed "Nusantara" or pan-Indonesian types)-a numerological gesture to the year of Indonesia's declared independence. Pirous called it the prima donna of the festival. Indeed, sample pages from the mushaf occupied the focal exhibitionary space of the entire festival complex. The original mushaf today rests in three ornately carved cabinets in the new Istiqlal Museum, located at Jakarta's Taman Mini Indonesia Indah theme park. It went into its first printing in November 1996 as a hefty, three-volume collectors' edition.4 Since then, a less expensive deluxe edition has been prepared as well. But Pirous's hopes for an affordable general edition have yet to be realized. Pirous's colleague Buchari has plans, meanwhile, for using the mushaf s West Javanese design elements for an Al-Qur'an Mushaf Sundawi, to be sold throughout the West Javanese, or Sundanese, region. Textual and National Projects in the Muslim Public Sphere In his recent study of materialist hermeneutics and literary pragmatics, Jerome J. McGann (1990) reminds us that texts are made as well as interpreted. Editions are always made by specific people with specific social and cultural projects in mind; indeed, the materiality and intentionality implicit in producing an edition destine that work for a particular sort of history of socialization and consumption.5 4In contrast to the display of manuscript pages at the festival, the published Al-Qur'an Mushaf Istiqlal does not include any notations that would distinguish its border illuminations or link them to specific regional sources. Such identifications have no place within the mushaf text proper. 5I am not claiming that an artist's intentions determine or rigidly constrain interpretation or reception; intentions have no such hold on the production of meaning and consumption. But such intentions do offer a place from which to begin interpretation and consumption. For a more elaborate statement about this approach, see "Some Things that Have Happened to The Sun After September 1965" (George 1997).</page><page sequence="16">708 KENNETH M. GEORGE Pirous is explicit about the significance of the Al-Qur'an Mushaf Istiqlal. A few days after the opening of the second Istiqlal Festival, he told an interviewer (Kompas, 1 October 1995, p. 2.): With the mushaf al-Qur'an we want to show that Islam doesn't have a face stained with blood. It is a face full of affection, full of scientific knowledge and pearls of wisdom that carry spiritual peace. It can be shown historically that many mushafs that we consider beautiful were ... relevant to the condition of the state. When the state was advanced, with a good economy, arts, science, stable, and secure, beautiful Qur'ans were made. With the production of [our] very beautiful mushaf, we want to reflect on the progress reached by the Republic of Indonesia in its 50th year of independence. Here he clearly wishes to link a golden age for the Indonesian state with significant Muslim cultural achievements. Indeed, Pirous prefers to see Indonesia and Islam entwined. As he remarked earlier in the same interview, "Indonesia is Islam, and Islam is Indonesia because the majority of Indonesians follow Islam." Yet he continued, "Until now, people saw Islam only as a mass power. There were always suspicions. For that reason, we can try to shift opinion with the keys of culture, arts, and so forth, and with Muslim society as the manager." Pirous here sounds like a publicist for the state and an advocate of state policy toward Islam and the arts. At the same time, he is not merely or wholly an agent of the Indonesian nation-state or its government. Throughout the planning for the second Festival Istiqlal he was mindful of the way in which different interest groups, including government figures and people close to the regime, might try to manipulate the event for their own advantage. In fact, subsequent to the 1995 festival, Pirous and his colleagues in the Istiqlal Festival Foundation (Yayasan Festival Istiqlal) have had to confront efforts by high-placed officials to take the new Istiqlal Museum out of their hands and place it under control of the Department of Religion. Further still, it is important to remember that Pirous is a sincere Muslim who wishes to see the Islamic ummat prosper, its engagement with spiritual matters and darul Islam deepened, and its voice in public affairs strengthened. Like the late and celebrated Muslim painter Ahmad Sadali, he regards art as a vehicle for dhikir (that is, remembrance of Allah), and, as such, a means for transcending (and potentially disciplining) worldly politics. His remarks about the mushaf are of course motivated, too, by the prospect of national and international attention for the mushaf, the festival, and his part in producing them. For religiously moderate, predominantly Muslim countries (ummat washatan) like Indonesia, warnings of an inevitable run-in between a monolithic West with a "Muslim civilization" uninflected by social diversity and ethnic and national interests (Huntington 1993) have been very troubling. The Istiqlal Festival is part of a calculated effort by the Indonesian government to promote a benign image of Southeast Asian Islam. At the same time, the country is eager to establish itself as a leader in cultural, economic, and political affairs within the Muslim world. As for his own interests in a wider Muslim world, Pirous's involvement in the Istiqlal Festival has earned him recognition beyond his reputation as a painter and graphic artist. He has helped in mosque restorations at the invitation of King Hussein of Jordan, and was designated Southeast Asian curator by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Aga Khan Trust for Culture for an exhibit of contemporary Muslim art held at the 1997 Venice Biennale.</page><page sequence="17">DESIGNS ON INDONESIA'S MUSLIM COMMUNITIES 709 Yet it seems to me that it is Pirous's designs for the public sphere that have the greatest significance for our understanding of how religion and the state are brought together and kept apart in Indonesian public discourse. From its conception to its recent display and publication, the Al-Qur'an Mushaf Istiqlal represents an attempt to summon forth an Indonesian Muslim public around a civic and cultural project, and to alert that public to its own spiritual and artistic activity. The source materials for the mushaf s illuminations offer an image of the "deep, horizontal comradeship" (Anderson 1991, 7) of the Indonesian ummat and also figure each community member as a potential artist. In this sense, the artist-citizen (rather than reader/critic) is the paradigmatic figure within the Indonesian ummat, capable of imitation and of being imitated. But we should not discount the specialized role of the trained artists, designers, technicians, Qur'anic authorities, and state figures, including Soeharto himself, who played a part in justifying and shaping this project. Even though the ummat is configured as a membership of potential artists, the true Muslim art public-as opposed to a mass audience for Muslim art-comprises a hierarchically ordered cluster of elite practitioners who speak for its interests, justify its artistic projects, and set the value of its products (cf. Crow 1985). By installing themselves within this elite, authoritative class of interpreters and producers, Pirous and other impresarios of state activity become arbiters of culture as well. And in the context of the mushaf and the festival, they also become arbiters of religious thought, outlook, and practice. Elite figures in the world of Indonesian Muslim art are thus a sort of authority distinct from, and in potential rivalry with, Muslim clerics, teachers, and legal scholars. Matters of art and culture are no longer left only to traditional religious specialists, but are increasingly being defined and commented upon by Muslim intellectuals and artists, as when Pirous was interviewed in early 1994 concerning the propriety of Karl Lagerfeld's (unwitting) use of Qur'anic Arabic on the fashion-encased curves of a runway model.6 In light of the way the Indonesian state and Muslim elites can be seen using one another in the mushaf project, it seems reasonable to ask, at last, whether nationalizing a Qur'an should be thought of as an innocent cultural or religious practice. The state is not offering disinterested patronage of an aesthetic and religious project, but is seeking veneration in its production of a sacral text. At the same time, it is attempting to recruit and exact control of those artists and intellectuals who can be expected to open the state and civic life to public scrutiny. Seen as moral revivalists and innovators, public figures like Pirous perhaps are willing to tolerate or even endorse such state projects, most especially if the recovery of national pride is key to expanded participation in a modern darul Islam (cf. Hutchinson 1994). For the Islamic civil society that Pirous imagines, there must be an art public as a mediating constituency that will bring religion and the nation together. Soeharto, on the other hand, desires an art public that will keep religion and formal state politics sufficiently apart.7 And this brings me back to Kuntowijoyo's essay: In its mediating role, a reawakened Indonesian Muslim art public, alert to the accomplishments of its past and to the possibilities for its future, may perhaps be harnessed to democratization and religious 6Whether artistic elites function in a radically different way than other elites in Muslim public life is an important matter, but one that I cannot explore here. 7As I already have noted, Soeharto is interested in expanding the state apparatus into religious affairs, so as to forestall or control the development of civic institutions in the Muslim ummat that would challenge the regime or alter constitutional mechanisms. My point here is that Soeharto prefers to see the ummat busy itself with cultural rather than explicitly political issues.</page><page sequence="18">710 KENNETH M. GEORGE modernization. But Kuntowijoyo's is a populist view of a religious art public, with little mention of the constraints and hierarchies that delimit its activity. As the mushaf project shows us, the authorities who presently shape this art public-that is, the authorities who justify artistic practices and tastes and identify them as Islamic- have produced objects and events that lend themselves to a discourse of acclaim, for Allah and for the New Order state, too. We should not forget, then, that in their careful manipulations and painstaking designs, they have put a check to those other potential functions of an art public-blasphemy and subversion. Conclusion In concluding, I want to draw together a few points worth emphasizing for an understanding of art, Islam, and the public sphere, not only in Indonesia but in some of the other authoritarian nation-states of Asia as well. The example of the Mushaf Istiqlal project shows that cultural production in the public sphere here conjoins state interests with those of artists, writers, and others eager to raise themselves to a central position in cultural debate and activity-hardly an example of the egalitarian public sphere imagined by Habermas. As in so many cases, hierarchies of influence and control are fundamental to convening a public and defining its discourses and practical activity. In the context of authoritarian rule, we can expect the state to encourage and take advantage of such hierarchies-and the cultural elites who people them-as a way of channeling public opinion and debate. Yet even while the state dominates the public sphere, certain figures can exploit its intrusions for their own social, cultural, or religious ends, and, in that sense, find room for maneuver even within the most repressive political systems. By recalling that the public sphere might best be thought of as the cultural space in which multiple and contrastive publics intersect, emerge, or collapse, we can thus explore the character and limits of oppositional practice. In the case of the Istiqlal Festivals, we are perhaps seeing the work of Muslim counterpublics that have been denied effective political participation in the Indonesian nation-state. Pushed into "non-political" religious and cultural activities by the Soeharto government, the ummat has responded in a bid to redesign and redirect its civil energies. As should already be clear, the Soeharto government not only has put a careful watch on this effort, but also has made an effort to capture the allegiances of the ummat by supporting events like the festival and linking them to national culture and patriotic sentiments. In this light, possibilities for oppositional maneuver, though never fully obscured, look exceptionally dim. The confluence of religion and art is hardly unique to Indonesia's public sphere; in fact, their confluence is, for example, quite visible throughout the Islamic communities of Asia, where it serves as a way for Muslims to explore the tensions, contradictions, and points of articulation between modernity and religious thought. It is troubling, though, that art and religion have never figured significantly into Habermasian formulations of the public sphere; indeed, they appear to have little place in his idealistic conception of the rational-critical discourse so central to his model of the public sphere. Yet the Mushaf Istiqlal project shows that art and religion can be lodged right at the heart of public debate and spectacle. With respect to the Indonesian case, Muslim religious discourse has to be counted as one of the primary means for defining and taking measure of public issues. What is so important about the Istiqlal Festivals and the mushaf project is the way the ummat is being fashioned</page><page sequence="19">DESIGNS ON INDONESIA'S MUSLIM COMMUNITIES 711 as an art-producing and art-consuming religious counterpublic (and transnational suprapublic). This is taking place at a time when Indonesia's Muslim middle and upper classes are rapidly expanding, and desirous of the emblems and subjectivity associated with piety and modernity (cf. Brenner 1996). The mushaf, and the festivals more generally, help relieve anxieties about leading a pious, modern life. And there is the matter of state intrusiveness: In the context of its depoliticization by the Soeharto government, the ummat has begun to think of itself as an enormous cultural force; the mushaf and the festivals not only confirm, but also advance this outlook. Pirous and his circle of colleagues are among those artists and intellectuals at the forefront of these efforts to socially and culturally reconfigure the Indonesian ummat. They have been recruited by the state, from time to time, to be sure. But in no small way, they have recruited the Indonesian state's support in encouraging a Muslim assertion of modernity. Last, it is important to keep in mind that the imagined comradeship of darul Islam exceeds the limits of the nation-state. So, too, do a globalized modernism and its art-industry. The dominance of the authoritarian nation-state in Indonesia's public sphere is in some ways always vulnerable to forces emanating from afar, most especially as contemporary Muslim subjects in that country seek to make themselves at home in a modern Islamic world. But a discourse of nations and nationalism seems basic to this settling-in process insofar as nations and nationalism are signs of the modern and fully suitable to Muslim political life. Indonesian Muslims want their nation. Thus the recurrent and chiasmal question that haunts the Indonesian public sphere: What political embrace is to be desired when a nation-state has designs on its Muslim communities, and those Muslim communities have designs on the nation-state?
