Although studies have been carried out onfear and anxiety in various species, including laboratory, domestic and wild animals, no consistent definition offearfulness as a basic trait of temperament has emerged. After a classification of the events that may produce a state of fear, this article describes the great variability in behavior and in physiological patterns generally associated with emotional reactivity. The difficulties of proposing fearfulness - the general capacity to react to a variety of potentially threatening situations - as a valid basic internal variable are then discussed. Although there are many studies showing covariation among the psychobiological responses to different environmental challenges, other studies find no such correlations and raise doubts about the interpretation offearfulness as a basic personality trait. After a critical assessment of methodologies used in fear and anxiety studies, it is suggested that discrepancies among results are mainly due to the modulation of emotional responses in animals, which depend on numerous genetic and epigenetic factors. It is difficult to compare results obtained by different methods from animals reared under various conditions and with different genetic origins. The concept offearfulness as an inner trait is best supported by two kinds of investigations. First, an experimental approach combining ethology and experimental psychology produces undeniable indicators of emotional reactivity. Second, genetic lines selectedfor psychobiological traits prove useful in establishing relationships between behavioral and neuroendocrine aspects of emotional reactivity. It is suggested that fearfulness could be considered a basic feature of the temperament of each individual, one that predisposes it to respond similarly to a variety of potentially alarming challenges, but is nevertheless continually modulated during development by the interaction of genetic traits of reactivity with environmentalfactors, particularly in the juvenile period. Such interaction may explain much of the interindividual variability observed in adaptive responses.

Several studies reveal that there is considerable individual variability in many aspects of behavior, even when animals are reared under the same conditions. Demon- strated consistency of interindividual variability over time and in response to environmental changes could indicate the existence of basic dimensions of personality, as has been argued already for humans (Zuckerman, 1991). Among these psychological characteristics, an individual's emotional reactivity -the ca- pacity to perceive and react to potentially an- xiogenic situations -is often hypothesized to be an intervening variable modulating a large range of fundamental behaviors arising from major life-challenging circumstances. For ex- ample, studies in laboratory rodents relate dif- ferences in reactions to threatening events be- tween virgin and pregnant or lactating females to the capacity to demonstrate maternal be- havior (Hard and Hansen, 1985; Ferreira et al., 1989; Maestripieri and D'Amato, 1991). Fleming and Luebke (1981) suggested that emotional reactivity prevents virgin females from behaving maternally. Moreover, inter- individual variability in behavior may be partly related to differences in emotional reactions among individuals. In mice, for example, fe- males obtaining higher scores for maternal defense in protecting offspring against conspe- cifics were less reactive in a previous stressful test regardless of reproductive stage (Maestri- pieri and D'Amato, 1991). Such characteris- tic patterns of reactivity could be used to pre- dict adaptive responses to a variety of major life-challenging circumstances. In the past, the concepts of fear and fear- fulness were a focus of intense interest in com- parative psychology. These concepts, however, were vague and lacked universally accepted definition. With the rise of behaviorism, these concepts, as well as those of emotions in ani- mals in general, were criticized as being too anthropocentric (e.g., Skinner, 1953). Con- sequently, it became more common to speak descriptively of escape and avoidance behav- ior, without any assumptions about underly- ing unitary states or traits (e.g., Anisman et al., 1978). This reductionistic behaviorism has subsequently been challenged, or at least mod- erated, by an infusion of biological concepts and rapid scientific development in the areas of behavioral ecology and neuroendocrinol- ogy. A reexamination of the validity of the concepts of fear and fearfulness is a goal of this article. In particular, a more global relevance might be demonstrated on the basis of com- monalities in physiological and behavioral re- sponses to dangers among and within species, for there is evidence that genetics and devel- opmental experience subserve individual dif- ferences in such responsiveness in predictable ways. According to Gray (1987), the study of fear involves two important concepts of psychol- ogy: motivation and personality. Fear and anxiety have often been considered motivators and are defined here as emotional states that are induced by the perception of any actual dan- ger (fear state) or potential danger (anxiety state) that threatens the well-being of the indi- vidual, and which are characterized as a feel- ing of insecurity. Fearfulness is considered here as a personality or temperament trait defining the general susceptibility of an individual to react to a variety of potentially threatening sit- uations. The Darwinian mainstream of behavioral ecology, based on the concept of evolutionary adaptations, points out that fear has definite survival value in wild animals. The life expec- tancy of an animal is obviously increased if it can react to avoid sources of danger. Defen- sive reactions increase the chances of individ- ual survival (by fight or flight, for instance). In nature, the most important threats of in- jury that an individual encounters during its lifetime come from predators and competing or attacking conspecifics. There has been con- siderable interest in recent decades in the evolu- tion of antipredator and competition strategies. These strategies are regarded as the product of strong selection pressures because inappro- priate defensive behaviors generally produce rapid and disastrous consequences (Blanch- ard and Blanchard, 1990). Studies in natural environments provide substantial information regarding the social function of fear and de- fensive strategies. An important part of the research on fear expressions as social signals is based on the</page><page sequence="3">JUNE 1995 FEAR AND FEARFULNESS IN ANIMALS 167 study of alarm calls. Animals of various spe- cies vocalize when they detect predators: mam- mals like vervet monkeys, Cercopithecus aethiops (Seyfarth et al., 1980) and California ground squirrels, Spermophilus beecheyl (Leger et al., 1980), and birds like black-billed magpies, Pica pica hudsonia (Stone and Trost, 1991) and domestic fowl, Gallus domesticus (Gyger et al., 1987). Alarm calls may be defined as signals that communicate possibilities of danger to con- specifics. For example, in free-ranging vervet monkeys, flight responses to recorded alarms are identical to those induced by the presence of predators (Seyfarth et al., 1980). Animals are able to vary call structure in a graded fash- ion to communicate information about spe- cific predator context to other conspecifics, as was shown in magpies (Stone and Trost, 1991). Such predator-evoked calls serve to rep- resent the type of predator encountered and help to coordinate an effective and appropriate response. By examining the reactions to alarm calls, Seyfarth and his coworkers (1980) showed that distinct types of alarm calls emitted by vervet monkeys are associated with distinct sets of responses from conspecifics, responses which appear to be adaptive strategies for cop- ing with the hunting behavior of the predators involved. In response to the recorded alarm calls of an individual exposed to a leopard, monkeys run up into trees where they appear to be safest from the ambush style of typical attack of terrestrial predators. The audition of calls emitted following the detection of an eagle causes them to look up and run into cover, apparently to avoid an aerial predator's stoop. Some acts related to fear may therefore be regarded as a means to communicate possi- bilities of danger to conspecifics, and conse- quently to influence their behavior. Natural predators are largely absent in cap- tivity, and it could be argued that reduced fearfulness is a rnajor concomitant of domesti- cation (Price, 1984). Populations of farm ani- mals in range environments, however, may still experience severe predation by wild ani- mals or dogs (Shelton and Wade, 1979). More- over, modern farming practice can impose several deviations from what might be regarded as the natural situation: A kind of artificial predation is practiced by humans, especially in intensive housing, where most antipreda- tor behavior is directed against environmen- tal changes and against people. For instance, in large mammals, the detection of a person who remains at a considerable distance from the animal may elicit no response. Closer ap- proach, however, which is often necessary on farms, often elicits a violent defensive reac- tion (Seabrook, 1972). In poultry, tonic im- mobility, characterized by a reduced respon- siveness induced by physical restraint (as when a human grabs a chicken), appears to be a defensive reaction against potential predators because it simulates a predatory episode (Mc- Farland, 1987). In spite of their captivity then, domestic animals can express emotional reac- tivity similar to that of free-living populations of wild animals. Fear and anxiety are gener- ally considered to be undesirable emotional states that may reduce welfare, growth and reproductive performance in laboratory, zoo and farm animals. In poultry, for instance, reactions such as panic or violent escape are often inappropriate in an intensive farming system, and the induction of a chronic state of anxiety or stress may cause damage to indi- vidual organisms and adversely affect milk or egg production, growth rate, or disease resis- tance (Craig and Adams, 1984; Jones, 1989; Mills and Faure, 1990). Thus, the develop- ment of studies aimed at reducing fear and defensive behavior in animals reared in cap- tivity could be of economic and ethical signifi- cance. The purpose of this article is first to exam- ine the status of fear and anxiety in the study of animal life and then to develop the rele- vance of the concept of fearfulness in the anal- ysis of mechanisms underlying interindivid- ual variability in adaptive processes. Animal fear can be assessed only if the fear-eliciting stimuli and the magnitude of the correspond- ing psychobiological responses are objectively taken into account. This article, therefore, re- views the nature of the frightening stimuli and the corresponding behavioral responses and neuroendocrine processes. After a brief de- scription of the various experimental methods and situations, the consistency among indica- tors of emotional reactivity is discussed. Inter- individual variability in reactions to challenge is explored in light of the concept of fearfulness as a basic personality trait that is subject to</page><page sequence="4">168 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY VOLUME 70 several genetic and epigenetic factors. Finally, I consider the possibility of temperament as- sessment in predicting adaptive responses to various environmental challenges and vulnera- bility to stress-induced diseases and pathologies. IDENTIFICATION OF FEAR NATURE OF FRIGHTENING STIMULI Some years ago, Miller (1959) asserted that most stimuli that generate negative emotions acquire this power as a result of classical con- ditioning. But there are substantial observa- tions on a large range of events that are capa- ble of causing fear that is not conditioned. Gray (1979) classifies fear-producing stimuli into five subdivisions. One consists of dangers that are part of the evolutionary history of the species, a second refers to novelty, a third results from learning, a fourth is the intensity of stimuli, and the fifth arises from interac- tions with conspecifics. Animals exhibit negative emotional responses towards specific stimuli that typically relate to persistent dangers in the ecology of the spe- cies. They may relate to physical dangers such as fear of heights, as is found in many mam- mals, fear of darkness, as in vision-dependent species like humans, or fear of dead bodies that may transmit disease or indicate the pres- ence of danger. Fear of potential predators has led to antipredator strategies, which are based mainly on associations between certain features in the animal's environment and adap- tive strategies for coping. For example, as men- tioned above, vervet monkeys give alarm calls with different acoustical features according to the type of predator, either terrestrial preda- tors such as leopards or snakes, or aerial pred- ators such as eagles (Seyfarth et al., 1980). Exposure of an animal to novelty is one of the most potent experimental conditions lead- ing to a negative emotional response. The re- sulting behavioral arousal is similar to that induced by a nociceptive stimulation such as electric footshock (Dantzer and Mormede, 1983). Novelty can be classified as a collative vari- able because the recognition of any stimulus situation as being novel requires a compari- son with events that have been experienced in the past. Faure (1979) observed that behav- ioral reactions decrease with repeated expo- sure to a previously novel environment. A stimulus can elicit fear by being associ- ated with other threatening events as a result of conditioned processes of learning. Learning plays a role in emotional reactions by identifying new sources of danger. Boissy (1990) condi- tioned heifers to be frightened by a visual ob- ject, initially nonaversive, by associating it with an electrical shock. Animals may be frightened by a stimulus because of the physical characteristics of its pre- sentation, such as its movement, intensity, duration, suddenness, or proximity. According to Russel (1979), these stimuli are not species- specific but rather are associated with the con- text of predation. For instance, a flying hawk leads more easily to a flight response in black- billed magpies than the same predator that is perched and not moving (Buitron, 1983). By using video playback images to manipulate the salient features of the predator, Evans and Marler (1992) showed that the velocity of the predator and the distance from the predator to the chicken are critical with regard to eliciting alarm calls in the prey. Finally, and as already mentioned in the introductory paragraphs, signals arising from interactions with conspecifics can also induce re- sponses related to negative emotions. These triggering social signals represent particular cases of the previous types of fear-producing stimuli. They may be characterized by nov- elty: Contact with a foreign individual may provoke a flight response in heifers (Bouissou, 1985). They may be innate, as in the case of a few alarm signals: Exposure of chicks to alarm calls recorded from conspecifics exposed to a predator make them peep and run away, whether or not they have previously encoun- tered a predator (Duncan and Filshie, 1979). These signals may be acquired, as seen typi- cally in most antipredator strategies and dom- inance hierarchies occurring within the social group. Learning from conspecifics, that is, social learning, to avoid future dangerous en- counters with putative predators, has been reported in birds (Curio, 1988) and primates (Mineka and Cook, 1988). In vervet monkeys, for instance, while infants can distinguish be- tween relatively general predator classes, with increased age they sharpen the association be- tween the predator species and the type of alarm calls (Seyfarth et al., 1980). Responses</page><page sequence="5">JUNE 1995 FEAR AND FEARFULNESS IN ANIMALS 169 of low-ranking heifers to threats from domi- nant conspecifics also reflect this process, al- though the role of social learning in domestic animals is open to question (Bouissou, 1985). In highly gregarious species, such as domestic fowl, the interruption of social contact is stress- ful since the social motivation of the individu- als is a potent factor in learning (Mills et al., 1993). An adaptive response to real or potential danger comprises two complementary facets: psychobehavioral changes that neutralize the effects of the triggering stimulus and neuroen- docrine adjustments needed to maintain inter- nal homeostasis. In animals, emotional states, such as fear or anxiety, can be indirectly in- ferred only from these observable and mea- surable phenomena. FEAR-RELATED BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS Behavioral responses to aversive events vary greatly depending on whether the threat stim- ulus is present (fear state) or only potential (anxiety state). The behavioral patterns can even be contradictory: Active defense (attack, threat) or active avoidance (flight, hiding, es- cape) and immobility or movement inhibition can all be viewed as expressing a fear state. Two types of motor inhibition may be ob- served. "Freezing" is of short duration and is usually accompanied by signs of activation of the vegetative system, such as an increase in pulse rate (Archer, 1976b). "Tonic immobil- ity," which is mainly observed in response to manual restraint (Gallup, 1977), is longer and not accompanied by physiological events that are controlled by the autonomic nervous sys- tem. Tonic immobility has been successfully used as an index of fear in chickens (Jones, 1984). Other responses considered as fear indica- tors include expressive movements (piloerec- tion, facial expressions), vocalizations, and the production of smells (pheromones). Some of these responses, such as the alarm calls, are a means of communication in social envi- ronments. Fear-producing stimuli may also affect other patterns of behavior. Archer (1979) observed that the effects vary and depend on the emo- tional intensity of the response to a threaten- ing event. When the level of fear is low, the activity in which the animal is engaged may be enhanced: The administration of weak electric shocks to a rat leads to an increase in food intake. But when fear is intense, behavior can be disturbed or totally inhibited: Regular nox- ious stimuli can inhibit aggressive interactions between rats (Archer, 1976c). Intermediate degrees of fear usually lead to a conflict be- tween the expression of fear and the activity in which the individual is engaged (feeding, sexual, aggressive, exploratory). For exam- ple, File (1980) showed that modulation of anxiety by pharmacological manipulation in- duces changes in the amount of social interac- tion. Conflict between an intense emotional state and a positive motivation may result in a displacement activity. Dantzer and Mormede (198 lb) observed that hungry pigs developed a compulsive behavior (nibbling of a chain) when feed was associated with a painful stim- ulation (conflict situation). Conflict between motivations may also provoke an intermedi- ate activity characterized by the alternation of two types of behaviors, as, for instance, in some aggressive or sexual displays. FEAR-RELATED BIOLOGICAL MARKERS There are obviously many diverse potential biological correlates of emotional reactivity and associated behavioral explanations. This article is purposely restricted to neuroendo- crine correlates and does not deal with all of the complex mechanisms of the central nervous system that are involved in emotional states, such as neural circuits, neuromodulators, and neurotransmitters, which are reviewed by sev- eral authors (e.g., LeDoux, 1990; Holstege, 1992). There is now extensive literature on the neuroendocrine changes that accompany exposure to environmental challenges. The purpose here is to attempt to show that vari- ous physiological systems can respond specifi- cally to psychological conditions, and that the neuroendocrine state affects the behavioral re- actions to danger. Neuroendocrine Systems Involved in Emotional Reactivity Sympathetic Adrenal Medullar System and Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Traditionally the sympathetic adrenal me- dullar system and the hypothalamo-pituitary-</page><page sequence="6">170 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY VOLUME 70 adrenocortical (HPA) axis are viewed as the major systems that are highly sensitive to en- vironmental challenges. Claude Bernard, in the last century, was the first to recognize that the relative constancy of the internal environ- ment is important to the functional integrity of the organism. Cannon (1935) noticed that emotional reactions, such as fear and rage, pose a threat to the integrity of the body. In the emergency concept, Cannon described how emotional reactions are characterized in par- ticular by the release of adrenal medullary catecholamines. Besides the adrenal activa- tion, emotional disturbances also elicit a re- lease of catecholamines both of sympathetic origin (Dodd and Role, 1991) and from a dense neuronal network in subcortical areas in the brain (Le Moal and Simon, 1991). These re- actions require immediate physiological ad- justments for maintaining homeostasis, mostly via energy metabolism and cardiovascular ad- aptations that allow a rapid redistribution of blood and energy toward muscles and the brain. The cardiovascular and metabolic adjustments have survival value in preparing the body for an active response to acute threat, such as "fight or flight" (Kuchel, 1991). The measure- ment of circulating catecholamines is extremely difficult due to their low concentrations, short duration of half-life, and high sensitivity to foreign events. Thus, the activation of the au- tonomic nervous system has usually been indi- rectly evaluated by the effect on certain vegeta- tive functions, such as defecation frequency and changes in cutaneous resistance, or on some cardiovascular measure, such as heart rate or blood pressure. Since Selye (1936), numerous studies have demonstrated that a variety of psychophysical events cause release of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary, which in turn activates the adrenal cortex to release glucocorticoid, which facilitates energy avail- ability over prolonged periods. The concept of stress was proposed to characterize the arousal of the HPA axis and was first defined as "a non-specific response of the body to any de- mand made upon it" (Selye, 1950). It took a long time before it was recognized that the profile of the activation of the HPA axis may vary depending on the nature of the stressor (Mason, 1971). In spite of many differences in their specific effects, glucocorticoids act in combination with adrenal catecholamines to enable the organ- ism to engage in rapid behavioral action by mobilizing available resources. They inhibit glucose uptake and fatty acid storage or pro- tein synthesis at storage sites, and stimulate the release of energy substrates such as glu- cose, amino acids, and free fatty acids (Mor- mede, 1991). It has been demonstrated that there are numerous interactions between the neurochemical controls of these two major neu- roendocrine systems (Axelrod and Reisine, 1984; Plotsky et al., 1989). In addition, since the discovery of serotonin in the central ner- vous system, there have been extensive data supporting the notion that there are close rela- tionships between central serotonergic systems and the sympathetic nervous system or the pituitary-adrenal axis (Chaouloff, 1993). Other Neuroendocrine Systems Although this article focuses essentially on the two major neuroendocrine systems lead- ing to the ACTH-glucocorticoid and adrenal catecholamine secretions, there is now evi- dence indicating that numerous other neuro- endocrine systems are altered under stressful conditions, involving gonadal steroids, a large group of hypothalarno-pituitary neuropeptides [prolactin, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), oxytocin, vasopressin], and another group of peptides localized in brain, pituitary and ad- renal medulla (13-endorphins, enkephalins). Many studies have shown that there are differences in fear and defensive reactions be- tween the sexes. In response to challenges, female rodents generally exhibit a lower be- havioral reactivity than do males (Gray, 1987). The same pattern has been observed in do- mestic fowl (Jones, 1987b). Likewise, in dogs and sheep, males are more reluctant than fe- males to approach and make physical contact with a human or a novel object (Lore and Eisenberg, 1986; Vandenheede and Bouissou, 1993a, respectively). This interpretation of the emotional levels of males and females has been severely criticized because there are many physiological differences, such as body weight or food intake, that could account for sex differ- ences in tests of anxiety (Archer, 1975; Johnston and File, 1991). Studies in domestic ungulates,</page><page sequence="7">JUNE 1995 FEAR AND FEARFULNESS IN ANIMALS 171 however, present evidence for implications of gonadal steroids in fear-related reactions. Fe- males treated with testosterone propionate ex- hibited lower fear reactions than their untreated counterparts in cattle (Boissy and Bouissou, 1994) and sheep (Vandenheede and Bouis- sou, 1993b). It is well established that prolactin secretion by the anterior pituitary is also increased fol- lowing a variety of challenges. The plasma levels of prolactin rose in rats subjected to electric shock (MormZede, Dantzer, Montpied, Bluthe, Laplante, and Le Moal, 1984) and in sheep tested during a period of social isolation (Parrot and Thornton, 1989). In addition, changes in the plasma levels of prolactin are linked to adrenal responses to aggression. In the lactating female rat, which has high plasma levels of prolactin, the pituitary-adrenocortical reactivity is lower in an open-field test (Stem and Levine, 1974; Hard and Hansen, 1985). The rise in prolactin levels is even positively correlated with the increase in corticosteroid concentration in rats placed in an open-field test (Seggie and Brown, 1975). The plasma level of prolactin, however, is not always af- fected by threatening events. In primates, the behavior of lower-ranking individuals, which is very different from that of dominant ani- mals, does not seem to be related to an in- creased prolactin level (talapoin, Miopithecus talapoin: Eberhart et al., 1983; marmoset, Cal- lithrixjacchusjacchus: Abbott et al., 1981). Some other peptides also seem to be closely related to the neuroendocrine responses of emo- tional reactivity. Corticotophin-releasing fac- tor (CRF), released into the hypothalamic- pituitary portal vessels, is the main regulator of adrenocorticotropin secretion by the pitu- itary gland (Dunn and Berridge, 1990). CRF, central vasopressin, and oxytocin regulate the sympathetic nervous system and stimulate ACTH release either directly or by modulat- ing the effects of neuropeptides (Gibbs, 1986). The influence of these neuropeptides on the peripheral endocrine responses to environmen- tal challenges, however, is complex (Ivanyi et al., 1991). The endogenous ligands of opioid recep- tors, the 13-endorphins and enkephalins, have aroused considerable interest in the study of emotions because of their role in the reaction to pain. Central 1-endorphins, which share a precursor with ACTH (the pro-opiomelan- ocortin), are released simultaneously with this neuropeptide in response to stressful events (Guillemin et al., 1977). There is substantial evidence that exposure to aversive events can produce a reduction in pain reactivity medi- ated by the opioid system. For example, when returned to an environment previously asso- ciated with electric shock, rats exhibit a loss of the pain sensitivity; this autoanalgesic effect disappears after the injection of naloxone, an antagonist of opioid receptors (Fanselow, 1984). In the same way, rats exposed to a novel envi- ronment also develop analgesia (Netto et al., 1987), which is suppressed by the injection of naltrexone, another antagonist of opioid receptors (Siegfried et al., 1987). Moreover, the administration of an anxiolytic before ex- posure to threatening events reduces not only the length of freezing but also the length of analgesia (Fanselow and Helmstetter, 1988). Ecologically relevant stimuli associated with social aggression and predation have also been shown to activate endogenous antinociceptive opioid mechanisms (Kavaliers and Colwell, 1991). Endogenous opioids seem to reduce the experienced intensity of noxious stimula- tion and thereby render the animal less re- sponsive to the challenge. Evidence that opi- ate peptides can enter the brain (Kastin et al., 1991) confirms the influence of the peripher- ally released opiates on the activity of the cen- tral nervous system. According to these data, the brain appears to be the most important target organ for hor- mones released in challenging situations, although peripheral sites, such as the neuro- muscular and cardiovascular systems, are im- portant targets of the adrenal corticosteroids and catecholamines, which stimulate the adap- tive responses that increase immediate energy availability for the brain and muscles. Modulation of the Neuroendocrine Pattern of Reactivity The magnitude of neuroendocrine arousal depends not only on the physical properties of the trigger stimuli like electric shock or heat but also on psychological factors. Psychologi- cal discomfort, which may result from uncer- tainty, conflict, frustration, or a high degree</page><page sequence="8">172 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY VOLUME 70 of novelty, is responsible for HPA axis activa- tion (Hennessy and Levine, 1979). For exam- ple, exposure to a novel environment leads to increases in the plasma levels of corticoste- roids in the mouse (Hennessy and Levine, 1978) and the squirrel monkey, Saimirisciureus (Coe et al., 1982). Catecholamines are re- leased in situations that require attention and vigilance. For example, rats placed in a cage where they had been previously subjected to electric shock exhibit higher plasma levels of catecholamines than do naive rats (McCarty and Kopin, 1978a). There is evidence indicating that the degree of control that an animal can exert over its threatening environment by suitable behav- ior, that is, controllability, may also determine the pattern of neuroendocrine arousal. This was demonstrated by the fundamental work of Weiss (1972), who used two rats yoked to- gether by shock electrodes attached to the same source. One rat could interrupt the electric shock (ability to control) and the other could not (no ability to control), but both subjects received the same quantity of electric shock as a result of the yoking. The rat that con- trolled the stimulation exhibited a lower pitu- itary-adrenal arousal compared to yoked sub- jects that had no such possibility of action. Since then, some other studies have shown that the extent to which the animal perceives the danger as under its control is of the great- est importance in determining the intensity of the emotion experienced. The increase in plasma levels of corticosterone observed in rats (Barnett and Cowan, 1976) and in mice (Misslin and Cigrang, 1986) exposed to a novel environment ceases once the animals have free access to their familiar environment. The be- havioral action of the subject does not even need to be related to the aggression to be effi- cient: Chewing a nonedible object reduces the adrenal activation in mice exposed to a novel environment (M. B. Hennessy and Foy, 1987), The possibility of moving, however, corre- sponds generally to an active behavioral strat- egy of coping, which leads to a decrease of the HPA axis arousal consecutive to the expo- sure to a threatening situation (Dantzer, 1986). The sympathetic adrenal medullary system is also highly influenced by the animal's ability to control the occurrence of aversive events. Rats that have the opportunity to control dis- play a more moderate blood pressure response to challenge than rats without control (Buch- holz et al., 1981). The predictability of an aggressive act may also reduce its impact. When uncontrollable electric shocks are combined with a brief stim- ulus following shock termination (i.e., a feed- back stimulus), rats show no more fear in this context than those exposed to controllable shock (Mineka et al., 1984). Repeated exposure to novelty provokes a lower activation of the pi- tuitary adrenal axis only if the exposure is regular, that is, according to a predictable pattern (expectancy), in both rats (Muir and Pfister, 1987) and mice (Shanks et al., 1990). Henry (1980) represents the differences in neu- roendocrine patterns schematically according to the subject's possibility of controlling or predicting the threatening event. He suggests that the medullosympathetic system would be predominant as long as the organism is chal- lenged in its control of the environment. By contrast, the loss of control or the perception of failure to meet expectations would lead to a preferential activation of the HPA axis. There is ample evidence, therefore, to indi- cate that the biological response to a threat is not stereotyped but is influenced by psycholog- ical factors and by behavioral strategies that have a direct impact on the threat. Influence of the Neuroendocrine State on Emotional Reactivity While the neuroendocrine response to threat- ening events is modulated by the possibility of behavioral action, the neuroendocrine state that results from an interaction between the availability of hormones and the functional properties of their receptors, both in the pe- riphery and the brain, may affect the way in which individuals react to aversive situations. Indeed, by binding to receptors present through- out the brain, glucocorticoids exert negative effects on their own secretion and also act on other fear-activated neural circuits (Bohus et al., 1987). Such influences occur by at least two mechanisms: a basic hormonal effect and a retroactive hormonal effect, as demonstrated through methods of adrenalectomy and ad- ministration of exogenous glucocorticoid to intact animals (Leshner, 1979). When an aver- sive event occurs, the basal hormonal levels</page><page sequence="9">JUNE 1995 FEAR AND FEARFULNESS IN ANIMALS 173 (basic effect) may affect the behavioral response by "preparing" the central nervous system. For example, the duration of tonic immobil- ity, considered as a specific fear-related re- sponse in restrained hens, is prolonged after the basal plasma level of corticosterone is arti- ficially increased by a corticosterone infusion at physiological doses (Jones et al., 1988). And adrenalectomy in rats decreases novelty-in- duced locomotion (Veldhuis et al., 1982). The glucocorticoid response to a threatening situ- ation in turn has an effect on the central ner- vous system (retroactive effect) and modulates the development of the behavioral response. Mice exposed to trained attackers fight less and exhibit submissive behavior more rapidly when injected with ACTH just before the en- counter (Leshner and Politch, 1979). This is due to release of corticosteroids in response to ACTH injection (excitability of the gluco- corticoid receptors), since the behavior is not observed in adrenalectomized animals whose plasma corticosterone levels are kept constant by corticosterone infusion. All of these observations suggest that the neuroendocrine state of the brain may be the ultimate mechanism for the organization of emotional responses. Moreover, autonomic and neuroendocrine patterns give additional information about the emotional state of the animal. At this level of the analysis, attention has to focus on the fact that the identification of fear-inducing stimuli depends on the type of responses they produce. By contrast, these re- sponses, labeled as fear-related acts, depend on the type of stimuli inducing them. Fear- producing stimuli and fear-related responses are thus inextricably bound. According to Hinde (1985), an emotional state cannot be consid- ered to be independent of the factors that in- duce it nor of the responses expressing it. These psychobiological responses are not stereotyped. A major determinant of the emotional response may be regarded as the result of an interaction between (1) the properties of the threatening event, (2) the possibilities that are offered by the environment to the individual to control the danger, that is, cognitive perception, and (3) the neuroendocrine state of the individual. The most efficient approach to the identifica- tion of a fear or anxiety state in the animal is to consider these aspects interactively. STUDY OF FEAR-RELATED RESPONSES: THE ASSESSMENT OF INTERINDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES VARIOUS METHODS FOR STUDYING FEAR Many kinds of laboratory situations have been designed to study the various behavioral and physiological processes of emotional reac- tivity by attempting to mimic conditions en- countered by animals in natural habitats. These experimental tests facilitate comparison of psy- chobiological reactivity among individuals in a standardized way that is difficult to attempt under natural conditions. It is not our intent to review all the experimental designs that have been used in studies of fear defensive reactions, but to focus on those most com- monly used in the scientific literature on both laboratory and domestic animals. Since the classic work of Hall (1934), the "open-field" test has been extensively used in rodents (Archer, 1973b). This experimental situation provides a number of threatening factors such as novelty, absence of shelter and landmarks, and bright lighting. Later, this test was used for domestic fowl (Faure et al., 1983) because of its methodological facility (easy use, rapidity, automatization, standardi- zation, and repeatability). More recently, it has been applied to domestic mammals and in particular to cattle (Kilgour, 1975; Koval- cikova and Kovalcik, 1982; Dantzer et al., 1983; Boissy, 1990), pigs (Mormede, Dant- zer, Bluthe, and Caritez, 1984; Taylor and Friend, 1986), and sheep (Moberg et al., 1980; Lachaux et al., 1983). Some other tests also have been used to assess neophobia. The introduction of a novel object into the familiar environment and the opportunity to leave the home cage to explore unfamiliar surroundings, that is, the "emer- gence test," have been used in fowl (Archer, 1976a; Murphy, 1977) and rodents (Barnett and Cowan, 1976). Reactions to novel objects have also been studied in heifers (Boissy, 1990), goats (Lyons et al., 1988) and pigs (Monnede, Dantzer, Bluthe, and Caritez, 1984; Lawrence et al., 1991). Hall (1941) described other methods for as- sessing fear and anxiety in rodents: handling by humans, exposure to visual or acoustic fear- producing stimuli, movement in a maze, and administration of inescapable electric shock.</page><page sequence="10">174 THE QUAR TERL Y REVIEW OF BIOLOGY VOLUME 70 Fear has also been measured by the decrease in social interaction between pairs of rats placed in a novel enclosure (File, 1980). Most of these tests were later used in fowl Uones, 1987a). Domestic ungulates have also been exposed to these threatening situations. Confinement was tested in cattle (Stephens and Toner, 1975; Veissier et al., 1987), exposure to a stimulus associated with an unavoidable noxious event was studied in pigs (Dantzer and Mormede, 1980), while exposure to humans was tested in goats (Lyons and Price, 1987), cattle (Boissy and Bouissou, 1988), and pigs (Lawrence et al., 1991). Presentation of a natural predator (dog) was used in sheep (Torres-Hernandez and Hohenboken, 1979), and the response to sound stimulation was recorded in both sheep (Ames and Arehart, 1972) and cattle (Boissy and Le Neindre, 1990). Another methodology was also devised to assess fear that involves passive avoidance con- ditioning (avoidance of an unpleasant event by the inhibition of a previously rewarded be- havior) and active avoidance conditioning (es- cape from the unpleasant event by displaying a particular behavior, e. g., two-way test) (Selig- man, 1975). In addition to experiments with rodents and fowl, these conditioning tests have been used in pigs (Dantzer and Mormede, 1981a). Many other experimental situations have been designed. As Archer (1973b) pointed out, however, these tests do not take into account the biological significance of the behavior pro- duced, and often had little or no relation to the behavioral repertoire of the species studied. CHARACTERIZATION OF FEAR-RELATED RESPONSES Relation between Environmental Challenge and Emotional Reactivity In order to assess the effectiveness of study- ing emotional reactivity in animals, attention has long focused on correlations. One attempt to achieve an objective evaluation of emotional reactivity associated with fear is to measure response after experimentally varying the de- gree of threat. The degree of threat can be graded by changing the trigger event from slight disturbances, such as gentle handling of the animal, to major physical events such as restraint or electric shock, and psychological challenges such as exposure to novelty (Kopin et al., 1989). It also can be graded by modi- fying the alarm-causing characteristics of the same threatening event. Some results suggest that the response can be reliably related to the degree of environ- mental challenge. In rodents subjected to elec- tric shock, behavioral responses (Natelson et al., 1987), plasma catecholamine levels (Na- telson et al., 1981), and HPA axis reactions (Wiener and Levine, 1983) increase with the intensity of the stimulation. In a series of ex- periments using various species, it was dem- onstrated that if the gradient of novelty varies with changes in the stimulus elements, there is a correlated graded psychobiological response according to the degree of difference from the normal environment of the organism. Faure (1975, 1979) andJones (1977b) reported that the duration of tonic immobility (i.e., reac- tion induced by physical restraint) decreases in chickens once the animals become accus- tomed to the test. A similar result was ob- tained in the same species when familiar ob- jects were introduced into the pen Uones, 1977a). The increase in the level of novelty in the pen increases the defecation rate in rats (Ivinskis, 1970), the plasma level of corticosteroids in mice (M. B. Hennessy and Levine, 1978, M. B. Hennessy and Foy, 1987) and rats (Arm- ario et al., 1986), the duration of freezing in chicks Uones and Faure, 1982), and the frequency of movements in calves (Dellmeier et al., 1985). Likewise, exposure to increasingly unfamiliar surroundings increases the ambu- lation rate in sows (L. Taylor and Friend, 1986) and calves (Dellmeier et al., 1985), in which the level of plasma cortisol also rose (Dantzer et al., 1983). However, correlations are not always found between the level of the disturbance and subsequent reactions. For ex- ample, the adrenal response of rats subjected to electric shock is not systematically related to the intensity of the stimulus (Natelson et al., 1981, 1987). Assessment of Interindividual Differences A great interindividual variation in the behav- ioral and neuroendocrine reactivity to threat- ening challenges has often been described. The importance of this individual reactivity has led to examination of whether: (1) the behav-</page><page sequence="11">JUNE 1995 FEAR AND FEARFULNESS IN ANIMALS 175 ioral patterns could be linked to particular neu- roendocrine traits, (2) the scores obtained in different environmental challenges correlate within individuals, and (3) the psychobiologi- cal responses to an alarming event are consis- tent over time. Relations between Behavioral Reactivity and Neuroendocrine Traits The significance of interrelationships is stud- ied from behavioral and endocrine parame- ters recorded during the same environmental challenge. Abundant evidence shows that be- havioral characteristics are linked to differential physiological and neuroendocrine responses to threatening situations. Defecation rate in ro- dents, the most frequently used index of fear in open-field tests since the work of Hall (1934), is negatively correlated with ambulation (Tachi- bana, 1982; Gamallo et al., 1986; Dishman et al., 1988) and positively correlated with the increase in heart rate (Candland and Nagy, 1969; Blizard, 1971), plasma catecholamines (McCarty and Kopin, 1978a), and the initial plasma levels of corticosterone (Gamallo et al., 1986). Such correlations also exist in domestic ani- mals. When chickens are subjected to an open- field test, the duration of freezing varies in proportion to their adrenal response Uones and Merry, 1988). In sheep tested in a novel environment, Lankin (1976) found a positive correlation between the ambulation rate and the subsequent increase in the plasma level of cortisol. In Chinese pigs exposed to a novel environment, a high behavioral reactivity is negatively correlated with low plasma levels of ACTH and adrenaline (Mormede, Dan- tzer, Bluthe, and Caritez, 1984). In the other experimental challenges, several correlations between behavioral and physiological values are also reported as significant. In rats ex- posed to electric shock, for example, the in- crease in behavioral reaction depends closely on the rise in the plasma levels of circulating catecholamines (McCarty and Kopin, 1978b). Exposure to an unexpected acoustic stimula- tion produces an inverse relationship between the amplitude of the behavioral reaction and the increase of corticosterone levels (Glowa et al., 1992). Behavioral reactions of hens ex- posed to humans are correlated with heart rate Uones et al. , 1981). For confined rabbits, tonic immobility is longer when the plasma levels of corticosterone are high (Carli et al., 1979). Behavioral reactivity and endocrine char- acteristics are not always related, however. The negative correlation between defecation and ambulation in rodents subjected to an open-field test is sometimes nonsignificant (Har- rington, 1972; Ley, 1975; Misslin et al., 1976). And the magnitude of fear-related behaviors cannot be systematically linked to physiologi- cal parameters. In rats tested in an open field, the duration of freezing is independent of the increase in heart rate (Candland et al., 1967) and corticosteroid plasma levels (Stern et al., 1973; Restrepo and Armario, 1987). In re- sponse to an acoustic startle stimulus, Svens- son and coworkers (1991) reported a dissocia- tion between behavioral and cardiovascular reactivity in rats. In squirrel monkeys exposed to novelty, there is interindividual variation in the magnitude of behavioral disturbance but no difference in adrenocortical responses (Coe et al., 1982). The relations between hor- monal and behavioral responses accompany- ing fear are not more marked in domestic un- gulates. Behavioral response to a threatening event is not related to heart rate in goats (Ly- ons and Price, 1987) nor to plasma levels of glucocorticoids in cows (Lefcourt et al., 1986). Most tests using novel environments that are performed on pigs (Dantzer and Mormede, 198 lb), sheep (Moberg and Wood, 1982), and calves (Arave et al., 1980; Dantzer et al., 1983) have shown a dissociation between locomotor reactivity and activation of the pituitary-adre- nal axis. Furthermore, the different physio- logical indices seldom show high intercorrela- tions (Lacey, 1967). Relations between Responses to Different Challenges The interest in individual differences has led researchers to ask whether individuals are consistent in their responses to different chal- lenges, and many studies indicate that they are. Brush and coworkers (1985) reported that rats exhibiting low performance during active avoidance conditioning have a higher defeca- tion rate in a novel environment. The defeca- tion rates of rats in conditioned fear tests and open-field tests are positively correlated (Ley,</page><page sequence="12">176 THE QUAR TERL Y RE VIEW OF BIOLOGY VOLUME 70 1975). Correlations are found among several pa- rameters measured in open-field, emergence, and tonic immobility tests and in response to a frightening stimulus in chicks Jones and Mills, 1983), hens Uones, 1987c, 1988), and Japanese quails, Coturnix coturnixjaponica (Mills and Faure, 1986). Good correlations among responses to a few kinds of frightening stimuli have also been obtained in hens (Craig et al., 1983), dogs (Goddard and Beilharz, 1984), and cattle (Boissy, 1990). A limited number of studies show that there is no striking correlation among the values recorded in various experimental challenges. In rats (Overstreet et al., 1992) and in chick- ens (Archer, 1976a), behavioral reactions mea- sured in the open field are not significantly correlated with any parameter recorded dur- ing the emergence test. Consistency of Emotional Responses over Time Psychobiological reactivity is defined by those individual characteristics that are consistently displayed, not only in different situations but also over time. Measurements of flight reac- tions in response to threatening humans have illuminated the issue of fear consistency over time because several studies in domestic ani- mals have looked at the same individuals over long periods. For example, Lyons and cowork- ers (1988) found that goats, when tested at several ages, show high stability in their reac- tivity toward humans. In heifers, flight reac- tion in response to a standardized approach of a human remained fairly constant up to seven months of age (Kerr and Wood-Gush, 1987), and in poultry, individuals are consis- tent in their tonic immobility response over time (Jones, 1988). Webster and Hurnick (1990) found that the distress responses measured in chickens in an open-field test at 17 weeks of age are related to their behavioral reactivity recorded at age 2 days. SEARCH FOR A UNIFYING CONCEPT OF FEARFULNESS IS FEARFULNESS A UNITARY TRAIT OR A COMPLEX OF FACTORS? Attempts have long been made to interpret the differences in individual reactions to the same environmental challenge in order to pre- dict psychobiological responses to other chal- lenges. Hall (1934) first used the term emo- tionality to describe the behavioral reactions (mainly the reduction of activity) and the physi- ological changes (higher defecation scores, for example) observed in a rat exposed to an open- field test. Later, the numerous cross-test corre- lations observed among various fear-related re- sponses suggested that these responses might be mediated by the same psychobiological pro- cesses. Gray (1987) interprets fear as a hypo- thetical state of the brain and neuroendocrine system that occurs under certain conditions and results in certain forms of behavior. Fear- fulness may thus be considered an inner trait of the individual, an intermediary between perceived stimulations (or independent vari- ables) and psychobiological responses (or de- pendent variables) (Ivinskis, 1970; Gray, 1979). Accordingly, fearfulness may be defined as a basic constitutional trait that determines the extent to which an individual becomes fright- ened in potentially alarming situations. We can expect, therefore, that when an animal exhibits a high degree of emotional reactivity in response to one challenge, it will most likely display high reactivity in response to another, similar situation. With this notion of a single scale to represent emotional reactivity, it be- comes possible to classify subjects by the im- portance of certain characteristic responses to- ward a few challenges. Not all tests, however, support the notion of consistency in reactions to diverse environ- mental challenges, and some authors, in par- ticular Archer (1973b) and Hinde (1985), have questioned the unitary construct as a means of defining fearfulness. Archer (1973b) said that Hall (1934) used emotionality as "a con- venient concept for describing a complex of factors" assumed to express sympathetic activ- ity. Taking the variety of fear-related responses as a basis, Archer (1979) proposed a more flexible model in which reactions are governed by multifactorial influences rather than by a single, central state. ORIGINS OF INTERLABORATORY DISCREPANCIES The conflicting findings reported above raise questions about the sources of interindividual differences in emotional reactivity. Among the possible sources of variation that may be identi- fied are variation in experimental design and interaction between genetic and ontogenetic factors.</page><page sequence="13">JUNE 1995 FEAR AND FEARFULNESS IN ANIMALS 177 Diversity of Effects Owing to Procedural Variations The variety ofprocedures. The variety of meth- ods used in studies of fear and anxiety may partly explain the discrepancies in results (Walsh and Cummins, 1976). Maintenance condi- tions could be one source of difference. Har- rington and Blizard (1983) showed that the results of open-field tests are not directly com- parable if animals are previously maintained under radically different light-cycle conditions. Defecation scores are substantially higher for rats maintained under a continuous 24-hour light diurnal cycle than for those maintained in a light-dark diurnal cycle. The physical con- ditions of the experimental situation may also account for differences among studies. For example, in rodents that are mainly active at night, increasing light intensity during expo- sure to an open-field test increases the level of threat. The change in the brightness gradient is sufficient to cancel the significant correlations between ambulation and defecation scores ob- served when the same test is performed with a mean light intensity (Tachibana, 1982). Be- cause physical conditions, of both maintenance and experimentation, differ from one study to another, their influence is all the more im- portant. The area of the device used to test cattle in a novel environment may vary be- tween 12m2 (Canali et al., 1986) and lOOm2 (Kovalcikova and Kovalcik, 1982), and its form can be square (Boissy and Bouissou, 1988), rectangular (Dellmeier et al., 1985), circular (Warnick et al., 1977), or even T-shaped (Veis- sier et al., 1987). The psychophysical conditions present when an alarming event occurs may also influence the emotional response. Chickens exposed to a novel environment have different responses to the same sound stimulus, depending on whether the sound is emitted by an object that is localizable in the immediate environment (Archer, 1976b). While fear and anxiety are both induced by threat, they can be distin- guished based on how the threat is presented. The frightening event may be actual (fear- state associated) or anticipated based on the presentation of cues (anxiety-state associated). Blanchard and Blanchard (1990) provided strong support for such a distinction, indicating that very different behavioral patterns occur in di- rect response to a predator (avoidance and attack reactions), as opposed to those occurring in response to olfactory cues indicating the potential threat of a predator (approach pat- terns). The social context. Because it can alter the individual's response to stressful events ("so- cial buffering"), the social context is also a potent source of variation among data. A vast amount of data on antipredator strategies show that alarm calls are sensitive to the caller's social context. For example, alarm calls in female vervet monkeys, Cercopithecus aethiops, are potentiated by the presence of offspring (Cheney and Seyfarth, 1985). The vocal be- havior of domestic chickens varies according to the nature of the signaler's audience: Chick- ens give more aerial alarm calls in response to overhead hawk models when they are in the presence of conspecifics than when they are alone (Evans and Marler, 1992). Several laboratory studies have investigated the effect of an audience on other emotional behaviors. In rats (G. T. Taylor, 1981), fowl (Jones and Merry, 1988), and monkeys (Coe et al., 1982), exposure to novelty produces less behavioral disturbance when animals are tested with a social partner than when they are alone. In fact, the animal does not even need to be in- volved in a social interaction with its compan- ions for the reactivity to be reduced. In a study with heifers, the mere presence of conspecifics is sufficient to diminish the threatening effect of an unexpected event (Boissy and Le Nein- dre, 1990). Inappropriate experimental conditions for the spe- cies studied. Testing animals in inappropriate environments, which is likely to result in ab- normal and maladaptive behavior, can also lead to an inaccurate estimation of emotional reactivity and explain the lack of correlations among studies. Conditioned avoidance tests, for instance, have been extensively validated as a means of assessing fear responses in ro- dents (Gray, 1987). The same type of test, however, does not always seem to be accurate in evaluating fear in fowl. While a conditional stimulus differentiates hens according to their strain when they must respond actively to the signal to avoid the aversive event (i.e., active avoidance), the same stimulus does not differ- entiate between two strains if the animals must</page><page sequence="14">178 THE QUAR TERL Y REVIEW OF BIOLOGY VOLUME 70 refrain from moving to avoid the unpleasant event (passive avoidance) (Rutter and Dun- can, 1988). This suggests that fowl are distin- guished during the active avoidance test by their ability to exhibit an active response and not, as was assumed, by the magnitude of an absolute fear response. Moreover, it is not well known whether tests measure the same motivations in males and females, and the validation of a test for one sex cannot be as- sumed to necessarily apply to the other (John- ston and File, 1991). Small sample sizes. Small sample sizes, which are not suitable for most statistical analyses, may also be responsible for a lack of signifi- cant correlations among the data (Gray, 1987). Tachibana (1982) and then Jones (1987c) showed how difficult it is to obtain statistically signifi- cant results for as complex a phenomenon as fear from a limited amount of data and too small a sample. Diversity of Effects Owing to Preexisting Individual Characteristics Adaptive responses to environmental chal- lenges are affected by preexisting characteris- tics of reactivity that are based on interactions between an individual's genetic background and past environmental influences on developmental and learning processes. Genetic Background As already mentioned, the sex of an animal is a major factor in interindividual variability in defensive responses. Adaptive processes are also, to a certain extent, under genetic control (Bouchard et al., 1990; Plomin, 1990). A ge- netic component accounting for part of the interindividual variability in reactions to hu- mans has been found in several domestic spe- cies. In a study comparing dam-reared goats with human-reared goats, Lyons and cowork- ers (1988) found that among pairs of twins, a goat's rank within the dam-reared group predicts its sibling's rank in the human-reared group. A consistent heritability of reactivity also has been found by studying defensive re- actions to humans in dairy cattle (Dickson et al., 1970), pigs (Hemsworth et al., 1990), poultry (Jones, 1986), and dogs (Goddard and Beilharz, 1984). The influence of genetic fac- tors on psychobiological traits of reactivity is reported even more often at the population level than at the individual level. Large differ- ences in the behavioral and neuroendocrine reactions to aversive events are found between breeds or strains of rodents (Olivero and Cas- tellano, 1990). For instance, in mice exposed to uncontrollable footshock, the magnitude of the increase in corticosterone concentration and in the time required for it to return to basal values vary with strains (Shanks et al., 1990). Similarly, exposure to an unexpected acoustic stimulation elicits larger behavioral responses in Lewis rats than in Fisher rats (Glowa et al., 1992). Breed-dependent differ- ences exist also in domestic mammals. For example, compared with European breeds, Chinese pigs display a low behavioral reactivity in response to a novel environment (Mornmede, Dantzer, Bluthe, and Cartitez, 1984). These findings suggest that genetic vari- ability may be partly responsible for the dis- crepancies among laboratories in which sub- jects of different genetic origins have been used. It is not surprising to find that variation in the expression of emotional reactivity is related to genetic variability. On the other hand, lim- ited genetic variability can affect the likeli- hood of finding differences in reactivity among individuals of the same population. Since lab- oratory and domestic animals have been highly selected, the interindividual variability within each strain is considerably reduced. From seven inbred strains of rats tested in an open field, Van Der Staay and his coworkers (1990) showed that the variability among individuals within each strain was clearly smaller than the variabil- ity among individuals from different strains. By studying correlations over strain means (genetic correlations) where the strains serve the role of individuals, these authors reported strong correlations between different measures, both within the open-field test and across dif- ferent tests (open-field and emergence tests). Accordingly, it may be harder to demonstrate correlations between values measured in sub- jects belonging to the same population than those recorded from individuals of different strains. Past Environmental Influences Previous learning, characterized by habitua- tion and classical conditioning, interacts with</page><page sequence="15">JUNE 1995 FEAR AND FEARFULNESS IN ANIMALS 179 the genetic background of each individual to modulate emotional reactivity. In poultry, for example, repeated exposure to human beings (i.e., habituation) or association of a food re- ward with human contact (i.e., classical con- ditioning) decreases subsequent behavioral re- activity (Jones, 1986; Murphy and Duncan, 1976, respectively). On the other hand, prior negative experience can dramatically increase emotional reactivity. For example, chronic stress (generally inescapable electric shock pretreat- ment) predisposes individuals to react more fearfully to subsequent alarming events, as was shown in fowl (Jones et al., 1988) and rats (Tejedor del Real et al., 1991). In addition, isolation or separation from conspecifics, as well as repeated social stress, such as chronic social defeat or social instability and subordination relationships, determine in- dividual neuroendocrine reactivity (Henry, 1982). For instance, daily rotation of rats among different social groups, which causes social instability, activates the sympathetic nervous system (Mormede et al., 1990) and may dif- ferentially affect individual reactivity to aver- sive challenges. These social stress-related dif- ferences are not found only between animals with distinct social status, that is, between dominants or subordinates. For example, the difference in the neuroendocrine profiles of free-ranging olive baboons, Papio anubis, in response to a physical threat is not so much between dominants and subordinates as it is between certain dominant individuals when the hierarchy is unstable (Sapolsky, 1990): Certain dominants exhibit a release of corti- costeroid in response to physical threats that is similar to the hormonal pattern of the sub- ordinates. Abundant evidence is available suggesting that increased environmental manipulations in early life leads to marked increases in later reactivity. Early environmental influences act especially during sensitive periods of brain development. For example, rats or fowls that received substantial stimulation in infancy, such as environmental enrichment or regular handling, were generally less reactive in adult- hood (Chevins, 1990; Jones and Waddington, 1992, respectively). Early environmental en- richment and handling may also influence neu- roanatomical development by increasing the number of hippocampal glucocorticoid recep- tors, which are implicated in both behavioral and endocrine regulations (Renner and Ro- senzweig, 1987; Meaney et al., 1989, respec- tively). The influences of previous experiences and early environment are partly responsible for divergent results between studies on emotional reactivity. For example, the fact that Jones (1977b) but not Archer (1973a) notes that the repetition of the open-field test increases loco- motor activity in chickens may simply be due to differences in social housing methods. Un- like the animals tested by Archer, those used byJones had been reared in a group and there- fore were faced not only with novelty but also with separation from conspecifics during the test. Thus, their increased activity with re- peated testing might reflect an active search for conspecifics stimulated by progressive re- duction of emotionally induced locomotor in- hibition. Differences in developmental maturity among animals may affect the reliability of results. It is indeed known that age influences the acute response to alarming events, although these effects have not received much attention. For example, adult deer flee danger while young fawns adopt the characteristic freezing pos- ture (Espmark and Langvatn, 1979). Because the phenotype and environment interact through- out life, one would not expect perfect consis- tency over long periods of time. Therefore it is not surprising that correlations among results recorded at different ages seldom show large coefficients of variation. Goddard and Beilharz (1986) found in dogs that the predict- ability of an individual's fearfulness dimin- ishes with time from the initial measurement, particularly when behavioral assessment be- gins at a young age. To summarize, discrepancies in results from different observations are partly related to nu- merous variations in procedural conditions that tend to affect the degree of stressfulness of the situation and limit the possibility of direct comparisons among studies. In addition, genetic predispositions and developmental experiences shape individual tendencies to be anxious, fear- ful, or secure, and thus differentiate individu- als on the basis of their reactions to adverse environmental challenges. Because emotional</page><page sequence="16">180 THE QUAR TERL Y REVIEW OF BIOLOGY VOLUME 70 disposition has so much effect upon responses to environmental challenges, traditional indi- cators of fear and anxiety may provide contra- dictory results if studies do not properly take it into account. This concept of interindividual diversity in emotional reactivity is illustrated in programs of genetic selection. GENETIC MODELS OF PSYCHOBIOLOGICAL REACTIVITY The existence of robust strain-dependent differences in adaptive responses to aversive stimulation has suggested that this character- istic can be genetically manipulated. Bidirec- tional genetic selection for a large range of behavioral and neuroendocrine reactivity has been successful in rodents (Brush, 1991). For example, strains of mice have been selected on the basis of their behavioral reactivity in open-field tests (De Fries et al., 1978). Ge- netic selection has been carried out in rats according to their behavioral responses to en- vironmental challenge. Roman rats, for in- stance, were originally selected for extreme differences in two-way active avoidance per- formance (Bignami, 1965). Maudsley rats were selectively bred for differences in open-field defecation rate (Blizard, 1971; Broadhurst, 1975). Wild Norway rats were selected through many generations, either for reduced or for high aggressive reactivity with respect to hu- mans (Naumenko et al., 1989). Divergent strains of poultry have also been successfully developed. For instance, hens were selected over several generations on the basis of high or low activity in the open-field test (Faure and Folmer, 1975), and Japanese quails were selectively bred for exaggerated or reduced ad- renocortical and behavioral responses to immo- bilization stress (Satterlee and Johnson, 1988; Mills and Faure, 1991, respectively). A heri- tability index of 0.5 for the reactions of defen- sive dogs has led to breeding of individuals according to their behavioral reactivity in re- sponse to an environmental challenge (God- dard and Beilharz, 1984, 1986). In selection programs, even though strains were selected according to one particular be- havioral or endocrine characteristic measured in a particular test, there are many recent studies reporting that the animals also differ in other psychobiological traits observed in a wide variety of environmental challenges. For instance, Roman rats genetically selected for a low degree of active avoidance behavior ex- hibit higher levels of corticosterone and pro- lactin following exposure to an open-field test than do rats displaying high active avoidance behavior (Walker et al., 1989; Castanon and Mormede, 1994). Maudsley rats, selected for their high reactivity in an open field, are also more reactive in an escape-avoidance conflict (Commissaris et al., 1986) and spend less time in an open arm compared to a closed one (Over- street et al., 1992). Similar results have been obtained in poul- try. Hens selected over several generations for low locomotor activity in an open field exhibited lengthened tonic immobility reac- tions, marked responsiveness to startling vi- sual or acoustic stimuli, a longer waiting pe- riod before venturing into an unfamiliar area, and decreased acceptance of novel food (Faure, 1981). InJapanese quails, chicks from a strain bred selectively for their high tonic immobil- ity in response to handling by humans exhib- ited higher reactions of fear in open-field and emergence tests Uones et al., 1991; Jones et al., 1992). Such wide-ranging effects suggest that genetic manipulation might exert a marked effect on fear and defensive psychobiological re- sponses. The association between neuroendocrine status and behavioral responses to threaten- ing stimuli may result from a genetic link. Such coselection is demonstrated by recent studies. For example, by making nonsegre- gating crosses (parental lines and F1) and seg- regating crosses (F2 and backcrosses) of the Roman lines, Castanon and her coworkers (1991) found that avoidance performance and prolactin reactivity are genetically correlated. Such results suggest that the behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to environmental challenges may be intimately interrelated and regulated by a common central mechanism that is genetically modulated. Rather than be- ing genetically related systematically, how- ever, the behavioral and endocrine characters of emotional reactivity may instead result from fortuitous coselection. And selection in defen- sive responses may partly explain divergence among the results reviewed above. As an ex- ample, Hendley and her collaborators (1986)</page><page sequence="17">JUNE 1995 FEAR AND FEARFULNESS IN ANIMALS 181 initiated a recombinant inbreeding program to separate hypertensive and hyperactive traits that are associated in the SHR strain, a line derived from the Wistar-Kyoto rat. They pro- duced a new strain of rats that were behavior- ally hyperreactive to environmental challenge like the original SHR strain, but without hy- pertension. Such psychobiogenetically selected strains provide an extremely useful tool for investigating the biological bases of interindi- vidual differences in emotional reactivity. This new approach ought to further an understand- ing of how genetic factors influence brain or- ganization subserving individual variability, particularly individual susceptibility to being frightened. FEARFULNESS AS A COMPLEX INTERMEDIATE VARIABLE IN BEHAVIOR MECHANISMS As suggested throughout this article, psycho- biological reactions to emotional challenges are only indicators of fear, and cannot be direct measures of the emotional state. Fear must be evaluated by studying not only the intensity of a unique response but also the strategy of the response. The different mechanisms underly- ing fear-related responses probably depend on other motivational systems that may modu- late these responses. For instance, differences in locomotor activity recorded in a particular test between two strains of rats are consistent with the high or normal activity for which the animals are selected, whereas the opposite response is observed in another threatening situation (Rogers et al., 1988). Therefore, it is difficult to attribute a given behavior to any single emotion or motivation. To say that behavior recorded in a given environment is a fear indicator does not necessarily mean that fear is the only cause of this behavior. And variations in the pattern of the fear response do not necessarily imply differences in the de- gree of fear. Because of the complexity of the phenomena that can affect emotional behav- ior, it is not possible to rely on results isolated from context. A measurement used as a fear indicator in one situation cannot be directly extrapolated to others, and it is impossible to assess the magnitude of concepts like fear and anxiety on the basis of a single objective and perfect measurement. It is likely that the vari- ety of fear-related responses represent differ- ent coping strategies. The above analyses illustrate the complexity of fear and anxiety concepts, and emphasize recognition of the importance of interactions among various factors in modulating individ- ual responses to aversive environmental chal- lenges. Although a certain consistency does exist in individual emotional dispositions, fear- related strategies depend indeed on numerous interactions between: (1) these individual ten- dencies of reactivity which are shaped by ge- netic background (species, strain and sex), experiences (early experiences and learning processes) and the state of the neuroendocrine systems, and age or maturation, and (2) the characteristics of the experimental environ- ment: social context, properties of stressors (including size, lighting, color, substrate, nov- elty, and procedure), controllability, and pre- dictability. Thus the variation among results is mainly due to this continuous modulation of psychobiological reactivity. If experimen- tal designs were carried out in a more stan- dardized way and if care were taken when extrapolating from one result to another, di- vergence among results should be diminished. Clearly there are at least two lines of experi- mental data that emphasize the relevance of the concept of fearfulness to a better under- standing of the interindividual variability in adaptive behavior. First, there are many re- sults showing covariation between behavioral and neuroendocrine traits of fear, both at in- dividual and at group levels, such as among breeds or strains. Second, the existence of ge- netic relationships between some behavioral and neuroendocrine traits of reactivity allows investigatation of the biological bases of fear- fulness. Consequently, most arguments against the concept of fearfulness as a basic characteristic may arise from the difficulty of comparing results obtained with different approaches. The wide variability of factors and responses re- lated to an emotional state is not put forward here as a reason for abandoning the concept of fearfulness. All this variability, however, makes it necessary to relativize the interpreta- tion of this concept. Fearfulness can then be defined as a basic characteristic of the individ- ual that predisposes it to react in a similar manner to a large range of potentially chal- lenging events. This profile of general reactiv-</page><page sequence="18">182 THE QUAR TERL Y REVIEW OF BIOLOGY VOLUME 70 ity is obviously adaptable, since it results from the dynamic interaction between genetic back- ground and epigenetic factors such as early influences and previous experiences. FEARFULNESS AS AN INDEX OF VULNERABILITY TO STRESS AND STRESS-RELATED DISEASES An imbalance between environmental de- mand on the one hand, and psychobiological reactions and neuroendocrine emotional states on the other, may account for various psycho- somatic diseases. The role of neuroendocrine systems as etiologic factors in mental disor- ders or pathological outcomes, such as hyper- tension and immune suppression, has often been hypothesized (De Wied, 1979; Henry, 1988; Karasek and Theorell, 1990). Given this complex framework, questions arise not only about the origins and correlates of inter- individual differences in emotional reactions, but also about consequences of this variability in long-term adaptive processes. Could indi- vidual differences in the development of stress responses or stress-induced physiopathology be predicted by a particular set of emotional traits? The study of emotional reactivity is likely to bring considerable benefits should a set of fearfulness traits be identified that pre- dict the likelihood of developing stress and stress-related pathologies. A few studies sug- gest that the development of stress can be in- fluenced by the susceptibility to be more easily frightened. For instance, it is observed in poul- try and rats that the more intense the fear reactions are, the greater are the psychobiologi- cal consequences for a chronic stressor (Jones, 1989; Tejedor del Real et al., 1991, respec- tively). A better understanding of interindi- vidual variability in emotional reactivity is thus essential to opening new avenues of re- search in the human clinical and applied ani- mal sciences. Given their possible relevance for human pathologies, animal models of psychobiologi- cal reactivity may be useful for developing noninvasive experimental tools for studying the physiopathological mechanisms underly- ing vulnerability to anxiety-related or stress- related disorders. For example, the clinical study of drug addiction has indicated that a major factor influencing psychoactive drug in- take in humans is an individual's vulnerability to the reinforcing effects of the drug (O'Brien et al., 1986). Recent research in rodents showed that vulnerability to amphetamine self-admin- istration, used as an experimental model of drug addiction, may be predicted in individu- als by assessing their emotional reactivity to- ward a novel environment (Piazza et al., 1991). The higher the locomotor and corticosterone responses of rats to open-field exposure are, the greater is their vulnerability to psycho- stimulants. One problem with animal fear as a model for human emotion is that fear in humans often concerns psychosocial threat rather than psy- chophysical threat. Indeed, as shown through- out this article, the study of emotion in ani- mals is often based on pain conditioning, conflict between punishment threat and hunger, or the fear of extreme novelty or open spaces. The question is whether these animal models are the best strategies for investigating the biological bases of the psychosocial reactivity in humans. It may be suggested that animal models using psychosocial cues would be use- ful for investigating the human personality. Indeed within animal colonies, emotional re- action of individuals is often observed as a response to threat arising from their conspe- cific group members, or at least is influenced by the social context (Brain, 1990). Regard- ing their linkages with human anxiety sys- tems, such animal models might be useful in providing homologies to a variety of human psychopathological conditions arising from ma- jor life-challenging circumstances. Investigation of emotional reactivity may also be particularly relevant to assessment of welfare in animal husbandry, since the well- being of an individual depends on whether it can effectively cope with environmental chal- lenge (Broom, 1988). Artificial selection for improved zootechnical performance has been accompanied by selection for adaptability to in- tensive housing (Price, 1984). However, farm- ing practice has changed too frequently and too rapidly for animal adaptive processes to evolve sufficiently as correlated characters. More- over, in intensive husbandry, housing condi- tions profoundly restrict the degree of control the animals have. As we saw earlier, this loss of control is often associated with increased HPA axis activity that may lead to various</page><page sequence="19">JUNE 1995 FEAR AND FEARFULNESS IN ANIMALS 183 psychosomatic troubles. A large range of ab- normal and undesirable behaviors, such as aggression, overeating, stereotypies and with- drawal, occurs in modern farming (Dantzer and Mormede, 1983). A few studies associate lower productivity with an increased suscepti- bility to being frightened. For instance, goats that are experimentally rated as more reactive present a higher degree of milk ejection im- pairment (Lyons, 1989). The findings reported throughout this article suggest that emotional reactivity in domestic animals may be open to experimental manipulation geared toward reducing the incidence of some psychobiologi- cal troubles. Because emotional reactivity is to a certain degree under genetic control, a selection program to reduce emotional reac- tivity may be undertaken in domestic mam- mals, as it has in rodents and poultry. Because experiences during particularly sensitive peri- ods are also important, changes in human- animal relationships during these periods may be recommended (Boissy and Bouissou, 1988; Boivin et al., 1992). The development of re- search for assessing in domestic animals the patterns of psychobiological reactivity might improve our understanding of the factors and mechanisms governing the elicitation of stress, and offer new strategies for improving the well- being of animals, and improving production efficiency as well. The concept of emotional reactivity is there- fore important and should be considered in nonhuman animal studies. Moreover, animal models are needed to establish the biological bases of human personality, because they offer an experimental approach that is impossible to employ in humans. Nevertheless, as shown throughout this article, anthropomorphism of- ten influences the definition of emotion-induc- ing events. The question is whether traditional animal models, essentially based on pain condi- tioning and conflict, are best for investigating emotions. It is suggested that some approaches realized in semi-naturalistic environments may be more useful, and that reactions in these settings better mimick responses to threats in natural settings. Indeed, laboratory animals exposed to natural situations associated with nonpainful threats (predators, partial preda- tory stimuli and contextual stimuli associated with predators) display a broad spectrum of emotional behaviors (Blanchard et al., 1990). Moreover, the vast amount of data on the contribution of social cues to antipredator strat- egies, which are studied in free-ranging ani- mals, suggest a new alternative for the study of emotions in the laboratory: inducing fear or anxiety through the emotional reactions of conspecifics. As compared with traditional in- vestigations, which study reactions of the indi- vidual directly exposed to a challenge, models based on the social communication of fear may avert subjective interpretation and anthropo- morphism. CONCLUSION Emotional reactions have an important im- pact on the relationship of an animal with its environment. The psychobiological responses to environmental challenges depend on the genetic background and early or previous ex- periences of the individual. A complex inter- action of these factors is responsible for the large range of variation in fear-related or anx- iety-related responses. Personality, tempera- ment or individual behavior exists in nonhu- man animals, and considerable progress has to be made in the understanding of interindi- vidual differences. Fearfulness has to be con- sidered as a component of personality and we cannot dismiss the validity of fearfulness as an intermediate variable that partly explains the interindividual variability observed in an- imal behavior. Further studies are needed to better understand the modifiability of emo- tional traits and the relative contributions of heredity, early environmental influences, and learning in the genesis of interindividual vari- ability in fear-related and anxiety-related re- sponses. The development of new approaches and technologies is now essential for provid- ing appropriate strategies for the investiga- tion of fear and adaptive processes. Social signals from animal communication that un- equivocally induce fear will allow us to study psychobiological patterns that might be func- tionally interpreted as emotional reactions. As Brain (1990) says, such developments "may enable us to make more sense of what is cur- rently a rather confused literature." In addi- tion to the interest in predicting the adaptive responses of individuals to various environ-</page><page sequence="20">184 THE QUAR TERL Y REVIEW OF BIOLOGY VOLUME 70 mental challenges, the study of fearfulness can be used as a new approach to investigate the processes that underlie the variability in vulner- ability to stress and to stress-related diseases. Such approaches are sure to have consider- able relevance for human clinical and applied animal sciences. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I am grateful to M. F. Bouissou,J. P. Signoret, and P.
