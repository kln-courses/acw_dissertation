<plain_text><page sequence="1">In Defense of 6'Mental States" Joseph Margolis Temple University I am grateful to Brian Lahren (1976) for having initiated an exchange on my paper, "Mental States" (1975), for both his and my intention in writing appear to be the same ? marking common ground for agreement and disagreement among philosophers and psychologists interested in the same puzzles about cognition and mental states. Lahren begins his account with a resume of my own views and then proceeds to offer a "behavioral interpretation of intentionality and talk of mental states." So perhaps I had better begin, myself, with corrections in the first part of his account, particularly where these promise to facilitate the kind of convergence we both intend to erfcourage. Let me do this in a tabular way: (i) Lahren says (p. 77): "Whatever the intentionalist philosophers may say about conscious experience or mental states, they generally agree that such events are in some sense directed toward, or related to, other events external to themselves or to other aspects of conscious experience. This characteristic of human mental phenomena is referred to as its intentionality. ' ' This, I'm afraid, misses the mark rather completely. The classic analysis of intentionality has it that mental phenomena (and, argumentatively, only mental phenomena) exhibit "aboutness," "directedness to an object" ? for instance, Ponce de Leon's wanting to find the Fountain of Youth. But to concede this much is to concede that the "object" of an intentional condition need not exist, hence need not be external to the condition itself. On the contrary, if the "object" were always identifiable independently of a given mental state, as, for instance, in whipping a horse, then the mental state in question could not be said to exhibit intentionality (Margolis, [1977a]). (ii) Lahren adds to this, which introduces another matter (pp. 77-78): "In the intentionalistic analysis of our sample sentence [I believe that X], the verb "believe" would be construed as implying the existence of a mental act or state, while the phrase 'that X' would be taken to imply the separate existence (at least in consciousness) of another entity or event. The referent of the former has a subjective character, the latter, usually objective. Notice, however, that in this philosophical view, the subject and predicate are construed as having meaning in virtue of their naming objects or events. In other words, there is an implicit nominalist theory of meaning imbedded in this way of interpreting a psychologically revealing statement." This, again, goes seriously awry. The important point of the intentional idiom has a dual force: (a) it does not permit the 223</page><page sequence="2">Joseph Margolis expression designating the content of a belief state (or the like) to be treated as naming an entity of any sort, certainly not an entity other than the belief itself; on the contrary, it obliges us to regard belief-ascriptions as monadic, in the sense that in believing that X one is in the state of believing-that-X; the belief state, being intentional, is not even properly characterized except by the provision of its intentional content; (b) it does not require that beliefs or other mental states be "separate entities" of any sort; on the contrary, belief-ascriptions are normally treated predicatively, that is, are predicated of other entities (persons, sentient creatures, etc.); no distinction between subjective and objective "referents" and no commitment on nominalist or non-nominalist ontologies is intended (or, rather more curiously, nomalist theories of meaning ? though I'm not quite sure what would be meant by a nominalist theory of meaning, unless it is something like W. V. Quine's view (1953) to the effect that meanings are not entities of any kind at all. I certainly do not believe that meanings are entities of any sort). Here, it may be useful to emphasize that what may be designated and referred to need not be an entity and need not exist as an entity (Margolis, 1977b). The advantage of the intentional idiom, then, is precisely that it permits the specification of mental phenomena in the most flexible, rich, and neutral way possible, without precluding its replacement or reduction by an any more perspicuous idiom once the systematic improvements of the latter are demonstrated. Defensively, it precludes ignoring the most persistent difficulty facing any form of reductive materialism (Feigl [1967]; Sellars and Chisholm [1958]; Margolis [1973, 1976a]). (iii) Lahren comes now to the application of his analysis (p. 78): "according to this popular intentionalist interpretation, the subjective component of the dyadic intentional relation is considered to be some kind of mental act having precisely the quality needed to account for the propositional character of those speech acts from which it was initially inferred. In addition, the other component of our sample sentence (the 'that' clause) is called the-propo&amp;ition or propositional object. Thus, the characteristic property of mental acts, their intenti?nality, is equivalent to, or explained by, human capacities for proposi tional mental states and this capacity is reflected in the characteristics of direct speech acts. To a behaviorist this inferential sequence seems circular. ' ' The critical error here is, precisely, Lahren's claitn that the propositional aspect of mental acts, the principal form their intentionality takes in belief contexts, is inferred from the capacity of human beings to perform speech acts and then, circularly, this feature is used to account for the cognate features of speech itself. The chief point to bear in mind is that, in analyzing mental acts, we use a speech-act model. Hence, we directly characterize mental acts in propositional terms, even if it is the case that we must infer from behavioral evidence that a certain creature is in such a mental state. There is no inference in the sense Lahren intends, that mental states and mental acts take propositional objects, only a philosophical argument that that is the best way of characterizing such states and acts directly. The "evidence" for this theory lies in a dialectical comparison of the relative predictive and explanatory force of accounts based on alternative conceptual models. This is an inescapable problem facing all scientific theories. Also, the model is required both for humans capable of speech and for animals incapable of speech, for animals to which perceptual cognition and the like are ascribed (Margolis [1977c]). Finally, a point Lahren seems not to appreciate ? and which behaviorists like B.F. Skinner have never succeeded in accom 224</page><page sequence="3">In Defense of "Mental States" modating ? the intentionality under consideration applies to molar behavior just as much as to inner mental states (Chomsky [1959]; Margolis [1973b]). In short, stimuli and responses, in behavioral (though not in purely physical) settings must be characterized intentionally. Lahren simply fails to consider or debate this consideration in citing Skinner approvingly. (iv) Lahren then provides an instructive ellipsis (p. 80): he says that a successful analysis of intentionality "would seemingly bode ill for such non-intentional accounts of psychological phenomena as behaviorists or materialists offer." But he fails to notice both that the argument given neither undermines behavioristic accounts of mental states, where relevant, nor constitutes a rejection of materialism. It is designed, destructively, solely to combat radical or logical behaviorism and reductive forms of materialism. It should for example be observed that a central-state materialist like D.M. Armstrong (1968) is hospitable to behavioristic elements in the analysis of mental states but is opposed to logical behaviorism, and he himself attempts a materialistic account of intentionality (though I believe he does not succeed). I may say that I regard myself as a materialist but believe that, as already mentioned, even behavior must be (functionally) characterized in intentional terms, that is, in terms not reducible to the terms of purely physical accounts. Hence, from my view, Lahren may maintain his behavioristic and materialistic preferences: all that is needed is to reject the untenable forms of both. Constructively, the argument is designed to permit all fruitful speculation within the boundaries of a flexible materialism. It is just that it cannot be shown that the only viable form of materialism is either a form of eliminad ve materialism (Feyerabend [1963]) or of a mind/body identity theory. (v) There follows a somewhat murky extension of point (iii). Lahren says (p. 81): "Caution is particularly important when 'mental events' are seen to be implied because of the features possessed by instances of self-description isolated from their contexts of occurrence. The point is this: until we understand more precisely the behavioral realities which underlie nomination and description with respect to private psychological events, or even public ones for that matter, we should be careful about taking our descriptions as entailments for some particular philosophical stance on the nature and importance of mental phenomena. . . . [Margolis infers] that mental states have a propositional import which is responsible for the propositional character of language." The trouble here is that Lahren concedes (a) self-description; (b) description of public events; (c) linguistic behavior itself. But //"these be conceded, I should say, first of all, that intentionality is already conceded as well; and, secondly, that mental states having an intentional structure cannot be denied. This is precisely the point of the inadequacy of logical behaviorism. Linguistic behavior is inherently intentional; and speech acts cannot be understood at all except in terms of theoretically postulated mental states. So it is not that one should hesitate in assigning mental states in the explanation of description and nomination until "the behavioral realities underlying" them are properly explored: to explore them is to analyze the essentially relevant behavior. What Lahren must do in order to vindicate radical behaviorism is to provide a satisfactory non-intentional account of description and nomination (and other speech acts). But if the force of this be conceded, then it is clear that, in a plain sense, Ido not treat the propositional character of mental states as being "responsible for the propositional character of language." I do 225</page><page sequence="4">Joseph Margolis concede that mental states (having a propositional structure) may enter causally into the production of speech (that has a propositional structure), but that is already a move within the theory advanced. In a word, my charge is that logical behaviorism is quite incapable of analyzing speech ? which, on Lahren's view (though not my own), does not yet involve mental states. (vi) There is a certain looseness regarding categories that infects some of Lahren's arguments. For example, he says (p. 82): "both the intentional features of language and its rule-governed nature are properties of language which are describable independently of generative processes. Such characterizations are structural descriptions appropriate to isolated linguistic events. Yet, Margolis construes mental states to be generative pro cesses, or as the behaviorist would have it, processes responsible for the functional properties of verbal behavior. . . . The way we respond verbally may be accurately, though only partially, described in terms of the uttered responses themselves. Philosophers are usually more articulate with respect to this dimension of verbal behavior and its linkage with other logically related verbal constructions than are most psychologists. Nevertheless, behaviorist interest focuses upon an additional dimension of verbal behavior: the antecedent and consequential events which form the context in which an utterance occurs." He had, also, maintained earlier that (p. 79) "An intention, as a kind of mental state, has a role in the explanation of human action. . . . Intentions, in particular, are construed to be the kinds of psychological happenings which have the potential to explain. ..." Now, if intentions are states, then they are not happenings or events', and if mental states are states, then they are not processes. Also, if intentional features art properties, then they are neither events, states, or processes; but then, it is not clear why there should be (as Lahren believes) any difficulty in moving from the intentional properties of events (linguistic utterances) to the intentional properties of mental states or generative processes thought to explain the occurrence of such events. Here, in following A.C. Catania (1972), Lahren seems to introduce several important confusions: (a) the equivocation on "utterance" as between an event or act and what is produced or generated thereby; (b) the failure to see that, in explanatory contexts, the characterization of the explanandum will itself be qualified by the theory in virtue of which an adequate explanans is supplied. On the speech-act model, sentences are either what are uttered or what can be uttered in suitable speech contexts. In that sense, linguistic events obtain when a creature in a relevant mental state produces an utterance; and the effort to explain that occurrence requires attention to theoretically posited generative processes (they need not be Chomskyan) adequate to account for such events. Hence, relevant descriptions in explanatory contexts are themselves theory-laden in just the same way that explanations are. (vii) This leads on to Lahren's next point (p. 83): "for a behaviorist, Margolis' claim of the ineliminability of the speech act model seems to function not as an entailed conclusion, but as an announcement or position-statement and as an introduction to his next agenda item: the dismissal of Skinner's and Quine's arguments against the employ ment of an anthropomorphic phenomenology as a starting point for the analysis of animal and human nature or alien linguistic concepts. . . . Let me simply assert. . . that neither animal nor human activities need be construed only in terms of the implications derived from the speech act model of intentional mental states. ' ' Here, let me say, in reply, that I 226</page><page sequence="5">In Defense of "Mental States" agree that it is by no means logically necessary to apply to a speech act model of intentional mental states: I should only argue that no other model has been shown to work (including Skinner's and Quine's) and that there are very good reasons for thinking (alluded to earlier on) that no other model or no model very different from such a model will do. The logical point I take to be benign enough; the dialectical, I take to be unanswered. As for the announcement of a 44position-statement," I grant that freely enough, but remind Lahren that it is itself no more than the outcome of a dialectical comparison of alternative models. So there is nothing sinister in it: it is in fact what we must all do. It is not clear that Lahren's theorists have yet succeeded in providing the required alternatives. (viii) There are, here and there, inaccuracies regarding my effort to rebut Armstrong and D.C. Dennett (1969). The essential features of my counterargument with respect to both are (a) that my objections are based entirely on concessions internal to their respective accounts; and (b) that my objections were never intended as an attack on materialism itself. It is true that I refer to my thesis about intentionality, but that is, as I have explained, itself based on a comparison of the explanatory promise of alternative models. Hence, there is no reason for Lahren to speak as if my argument is merely self-serving, the result of what he terms (p. 84) 44an a priori linguistically based intentional characterization of the person or creature of whom [an ascription of awareness] is made." He himself admits ? what I should have thought would invite a more hospitable reception of my own view ? that "unfortunately, the nonteleological alternatives to the intentionalist view so far presented have fallen short of providing a satisfactory account" (p. 85). For, this is actually something of an understatement: the alternative theories have not even convincingly suggested how they could succeed. The rest of Lahren's paper is designed to meet the challenge. I will continue, therefore, with a tabular form of presentation. (ix) It is clear that one of Lahren's chief worries is to avoid the private-language thesis that Wittgenstein and Skinner both oppose. This is the point of his remark (p. 86) that "the objective features of the situations in which we learn mental terms and their usage are not direct equivalents of the ones in which we learn object-name relationships." I agree entirely, never meant to deny that at all. If behaviorists are principally worried because they think that the introduction of mental states entails a private language (4 'private ostensive definition") ? and with it, the rejection of public forms of confirma tion and verification ? then all I can say is that the fear is largely misguided. Lahren seems to think that my argument somehow has to do with smuggling in the private language thesis. I might add that Wittgenstein (whom Lahren seems to absorb, wrongly, in to the behaviorist camp) never actually denied sensations, images, thoughts, inten tions, and the like: he offered certain suggestsions about the analysis of discourse about them. More seriously, what Lahren fails to take notice of is the import of his own wording, namely, that we learn to speak both of public objects and of our own mental states. What I should insist on, simply, is that the admission that we learn entails the admission of mental states and that Lahren himself acknowledges that the alternative view has so far not "yet" succeeded either in eliminating or reducing the mental states entailed. So there is no need to ignore the complexity of these admissions on the grounds of avoiding a danger that does not and need not arise. (Which is not to deny that the nature 227</page><page sequence="6">Joseph Margolis of self-referential discourse about mental states does not have its own pitfalls, or even that the proponents of a private language cannot provide stronger arguments than are ordinarily supposed.) (x) Linked to the foregoing is another worry. Lahren says (p. 87): "one's usage of terms for 'mental states' in the first person is initially connected with those public events upon which the common usage of language must be based ... an immense amount of exposure to language learning contexts precedes any given instance. The situation ... is not one which forces upon us any notion of causal intentional mental states of the sort presumed primitive by Margolis." Here, the key is an equivocation on "primitive," in the sense (a) .of the irreducible or (b) of the temporally or conceptually prior to what is complex (either caused by, or analyzable into, the other). I should only maintain the (a) interpretation of "primitive," though I admit, as I have said, that once .mental states and mental events are conceded, there is no reason to deny them a causal role or to deny that there are complexes analyzable at least in part in terms of mental states and events. As I have said, speech acts are dependent in this sense. Hence, if behaviorists are worried because they think that the admission of mental states introduces some sort of idealism or solipsism, then once again the fear is largely misguided. (xi) There is a further, extremely strategic matter that Lahren presses, relying heavily on Skinner. He says (p. 90): "Margolis, and intentionalists generally, presume that the directedness of higher animal and human activity has an explanation in the unique causal nature of intentional mental processes. . . . The discovery of op?rant behavioral proces ses, and in particular the selecting effects of reinforcement, provides a means of freeing the natural purposiveness of behavioral episodes from the paradoxes associated with traditional, mentalistic, purposive or teleological accounts." First of all, considerations of survival ? whether of individual or species ? of natural selection, and of environ mental causal forces are entirely compatible with the admission of mental states, their intentionality, and the causal efficacy of mental phenomena. Secondly, the admission of mental phenomena does not entail a dualism, a rejection of materialism, or any particular analysis of mental phenomena themselves. Thirdly, a point normally neglected by logical behaviorists, the environment may itself include intentionally qualified forces, as in the effect of the behavior of one person on another. Fourthly, the admission of a general context of survival does not in itself insure the elimination or reduction of mental states or of intentionally characterized behavior. For example, even granting that verbal behavior has a certain survival value, that admission alone goes no distance at all toward providing a non-intentionalistic analysis of speech or an analysis that does not depend on the admission of mental states and mental acts. How an emphasis on selection and survival undermines mentalistic, intentionalistic, or teleological models of explanation is simply not satisfactorily explained either by Lahren or by Skinner. There is a lacuna here that has never been directly faced by Skinner. But behaviorists are worried because they fear that evolutionary and environmental considerations are somehow disadvantaged by the admission of mental states, the fear is entirely misguided. After all, it is very plausible to argue that sensations, imagination and other mental phenomena have a definite and determinate survival value. What Skinner has somehow conflated is the non intentionalistic (or non-mentalistic or non-teleological) analysis of behavior with the thesis that behavior has, selectively, a certain survival value and, hence, may be 228</page><page sequence="7">In Defense of "Mental States" environmentally reinforced. The issues are, conceptually, quite distinct. So it is simply irrelevant to the issue of which among competing alternatives would be an adequate model of explanation here, to note that such a model must, minimally, accommodate the facts of environmental influence and natural selection. Most hospitably construed, the argument is an instance of ignoratio elenchi. (xii) Finally, Lahren reveals that one of the chief contributions of a behavioristic model is its resistance to dualism. In this context, he says (p. 93): "although mental and physical terms and their attribution to humans may be engaged differently in different verbal communities ... the behavioral processes involved in such discriminative re sponding provides no basis for a dualistic ontology at the level of events which stand in a controlling relation to such discriminative responding. The upshot of this for behaviorists is the conclusion that references to dualism do not actually relate to substantive ontologi cal issues, but rather they discriminate differences in linguistic explanatory practices. . . . The dualism is linguistic in nature, not a dualism of events or properties. What then are we to make of Margolis' claim that the identification of special features of the ascription of mental predicates to persons weighs on the issue of the extent to which materialist characterizations (involving only physical events or physical processes) are inappropriate for persons?" This is an unfortunate but extremely revealing formulation. For one thing, there is nothing wrong with purely physical characterizations of persons; what is wrong (on the thesis) is that one can characterize persons in exclusively physical terms (Strawson [1959]; Margolis [1976b]). After all, a human person may have a certain weight and height. Secondly, as I have tried to suggest, the admission of mental states, mental events, mental processes does not entail ontological dualism. In fact, Lahren obscures somewhat the sense of that distinction, for when one speaks of ontological dualism it normally is intended to convey that there are two fundamentally different kinds of substance (the mental and the physical: Cartesianism) that are at stake. As soon as one admits the non-reducibility of functional attributes to non-functional attributes, one is committed to a dualism of properties (if one wishes so to speak). Hence, //*the mental is the functional ? or at least if what is mental is functional (Putnam [ 1960] ; Fodor [ 1968] ), then, on the behaviorist's own admission (if I understand him rightly), we cannot but be committed to a dualism of properties if we cannot show how to reduce the functional features of behavior to non-functional features (functional features initially admitted by the behaviorist, readily enough, e.g., p. 92). But this sort of dualism, precisely because it does not involve a dualism of substance, is benign: it counts only against reductionism, not materialism. It is also the principal point of issue between so-called mentalists (Fodor [1968]) and logical behaviorists ? without in the least invoking dualism. Hence, finally, it is simply false, as Lahren maintains (and as Skinner often seems to maintain) that the dualism is merely "linguistic" in nature and not a dualism of properties. It is a dualism of properties, but that is precisely what moderate behaviorists and those who otherwise oppose logical behaviorism are entirely willing to concede. REFERENCES Armstrong, D.M.
