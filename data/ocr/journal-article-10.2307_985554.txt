<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SEXUAL DIFFERENCES IN SIZE AMONG BIRDS DEAN AMADON Lamont Curator of Birds, Chairman, Department of Birds, American Museum of Natural History (Read November 14, 1958) THE egg cells of animals are large, yolk-filled, nutritive, inactive; the sperm cells small, active, and without reserves of stored food. This dis- parity in the basic sex cells tends to be reflected in the size of the animals themselves. Females of many spiders, insects, fishes, and some am- phibians such as toads (Bufo) are larger and heavier-bodied than the males. An extreme is the deep-sea angler fish of the family Ceratiidae in which the tiny male attaches himself to the body of his vastly larger mate and in time be- comes little more than a parasitic appendage. All his organ systems, save only the reproduc- tive, degenerate. In the higher vertebrates, including some reptiles, and especially birds and mammals, the situation is reversed and the male is usually the larger of the two sexes. The reason for this will be considered later, but first we may men- tion one family of birds, the hummingbirds (Trochilidae), in which the male is the smaller sex in many of the species. In the ruby-throated hummingbird, Archilochus colubris, of eastern North America, for example, the length of the wings (an index to size) averages 38.5 milli- meters in the 'males and 44.5 in the females. An interesting corollary of this size disparity, demonstrated by Mr. Crawford H. Greenewalt, is that the smaller males average 55 wing beats per second as compared with 50 in the females. In most birds, however, as already stated, males are larger. Darwin (1874, here cited from a 1922 edition), in his The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex, published a great deal of information on sexual dimorphism. His explanation of the superior size of the male in most species of higher vertebrates, including birds, was that the males compete with one another for mates. In this struggle those that are larger or stronger than the average will have an advantage. They will secure more mates and leave more offspring. In so far as their larger size is hereditary it will be preserved by natural selection. In other words, the larger size of the males of most birds and mammals is an adaptation. This explanation by Darwin is accepted to the present day, and the present review seeks only to marshal further evidence in its support and to discuss certain exceptions. Even among insects, contrary to the general rule, the male is larger than the female in a few species in which the males do contest with each other for mates. One of these is the Hercules beetle, Dynastes hercules. As Dr. William Beebe (1947) has shown, the male of this species seeks to grasp his rival, raise him aloft, and crash him against the ground. Successful in this, he may then sometimes pick up the much smaller female bodily and carry her away from the scene of conflict. Among birds the male is larger than the female in most species, including all those comprising certain families. In a considerable number of species the sexes are alike in size. The remain- ing species-those in which the female is the larger-are, as noted below, confined chiefly to a few families. In some species in which the male is the larger as shown by skeletal or other measurements, the difference is very slight, so much so that in the laying season the female may temporarily weigh more than the male. Eaton (1957) has given an example in the wood warbler genus Seiurus. In most species the size differential is somewhat greater-five to ten per cent-and it may be much more. Assuming, as implied above, that when males contest for mates those of superior size are favored, how is this selection translated genet- ically into increased size of the males only? One might expect that most mutations will not be sex-linked and will affect both sexes equally. But each species occupies its own particular ecological niche, and selective factors will usually prevent pronounced changes in size in either direction. Variation is only permissible within limits, and one may suppose that the advantages to the males of greater size outweigh the dis- advantages, whereas in the females they do not. In other words, greater size becomes a secondary PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY, VOL. 103, NO. 4, AUGUST, 1959 531</page><page sequence="2">532 DEAN AMADON [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. sexual character of the male, and the genetic and hormonal background may be assumed to be similar to that involved in other types of secondary sexual dimorphism. In birds of polygamous or promiscuous mating habits, the size dimorphism is often greater than in monogamous ones. As an example of the extent of size dimorphism in some polygamous species of birds, one may cite the following. In the eastern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) large hens weigh about fourteen pounds; gobblers up to twenty-five, or almost twice as much. Comparable differences exist in such species as the great bustard (Otis tarda), some of the larger pheasants, and in a few other groups. In the capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), largest of the grouse, the male weighs more than twice as much as the female. In these families the larger species often show relatively greater sexual size dimorphism as well as greater development of other secondary sexual characters than do the smaller ones. Rensch (1950) has discussed this. In the grouse (Tetra- onidae) some of the smaller species like the ptarmigans (Lagopus) are monogamous, the larger species such as the sage grouse (Centro- cercus) highly polygamous or promiscuous. The following average weights of European grouse, taken from Hagen's (1942) excellent study, will show how dimorphism increases as the total size becomes greater: Males Females Hazel grouse 369 grams 370 grams (Tetrastes bonasia) Rock ptarmigan 519 grams 421 grams (Lagopus mutus) Willow ptarmigan 584 grams 517 grams (Lagopus lagopus) Black grouse 1,269 grams 945 grams (Lyrurus tetrix) Capercaillie 4,230 grams 1,985 grams (Tetrao urogallus) Among the songbirds, the blackbirds and orioles (Icteridae) may be cited as a family in which the smaller species are usually monog- amous or partly monogamous and show only moderate size dimorphism, while the larger species are polygamous and show greater dimor- phism. Selander (1958) has published data to illustrate this. It is not difficult to understand why polyg- amous or promiscuous species should show a greater degree of size dimorphism. In such species each successful male will have several mates. It is not necessary that there be as many males as females. The former are, to a degree, expendable. Hence adverse selective factors as regards increasing size will be less stringent in polygamous species. Eventually, to be sure, counterselection will become opera- tive and put a check on increasing size. In the great bustard (Otis tarda) or the wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), for example, the size of the males is now approaching the upper limits at which flight is possible, at least in ground- dwelling birds. - There is some evidence that, in such highly dimorphic species as turkeys, pheasants, and others, the males are more vulnerable than fe- males to certain predators and also to climatic extremes. To be sure, in some of these species the vulnerability of the adult males is increased by the fact that they also have ornamental plumes which make them conspicuous or en- cumber them in flight. Their courtship displays and their fights with other males also tend to expose them to enemies, though at other seasons they may be shyer than the females. In some of them the male sheds his ornamental plumes during the nonbreeding season; in others he does not. An illustration of the fact that increased size may be hazardous is provided by a study (Stein, 1950) of mortality in the European mole (Talpa) during an unusually severe winter. The largest individuals in this instance suffered the greatest inroads from cold or starvation. Why the smaller species of such families as the grouse (Tetraonidae), bustards (Otididae), and quails and pheasants (Phasianidae) should show less dimorphism and be less polygamous or even monogamous in their mating habits is a moot question. There is no similar trend in birds of paradise (Paradiseidae), manakins (Pipridae), or hummingbirds (Trochilidae), which have ex- treme dimorphism and promiscuous mating habits. Perhaps in such families as the grouse (Tetra- onidae) or bustards (Otididae) there is a tend- ency towards highly polygamous or promiscuous behavior-a tendency which, for little under- stood reasons, can find fuller expression in large species than in small ones. Among a few genera or groups of songbirds (Oscines) one can also find examples of increase of sexual size dimorphism in the larger species. I have compared the Hawaiian forms Loxops virens and Hemignathus obscurus, and also the West African sunbirds Cyanomitra newtoni and</page><page sequence="3">VOL. 103, NO. 4, 1959] SEXUAL DIFFERENCES IN SIZE AMONG BIRDS 533 Dreptes thomensis (Amadon, 1950: 187-189; 1953: 447). In both instances we are dealing with rather peculiar insular types, and in both instances dimorphism in bill size and length outstrips that of general size, as reflected in wing length. Whether the selective factors involved concern primarily the bill or the general size is unknown. Indeed, some nonselective allometric factors may be involved, as suggested by Rensch (1950) for somewhat similar instances. Today, however, the feeling is that allometric interpretation must be rejected. Kramer has championed this point of view. Offhand, how- ever, it does not seem impossible that the onto- genetic growth trends responsible for sexual size differences of adults might be continued phylo- genetically to some extent in rapidly evolving insular forms subject to a minimum of competi- tion and predation from other species. As an example of great dimorphism in a song- bird lacking, so far as known, any marked peculiarities of mating behavior, one may cite an Australian grassland species, Cincloramphus cruralis. It is somewhat like a lark (Alauda) in habits, but its exact affinities among the song- birds are in doubt. Serventy and Whittell (1951: 302) give the weight of the male as 21 to 3 ounces, that of the female as 1 ounce. This is the greatest differ- ence known to me in any bird. Weights of five specimens from Queensland in the American Museum of Natural History suggest a slightly lesser, though still a great difference. They are, in grams: 2 males, 65 and 68; 3 females, 28, 32, and 32. Among polygamous land mammals such as cattle, sexual size dimorphism, though pro- nounced, is less than in the extremes among birds. In some aquatic mammals, however, notably the highly polygamous northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus), the male may weigh six times as much as the female. We may now consider birds in which the female is the larger of the two sexes. There are a number of families-rheas (Rheidae), tina- mous (Tinamidae), emus (Dromaeidae), casso- waries (Casuariidae), phalaropes (Phalaropodi- dae), painted snipe (Rostratulidae), jacanas (Jacanidae), button-quail (Turnicidae), and some of the sandpipers (Scolopacidae) in which the female is not only larger than the male, but often more brightly colored. In all of them, apparently, the female plays the dominant role in courtship. The male, on the other hand, performs the incubation and takes care of the young, so that one is tempted to apply the anthropomorphic term "hen-pecked" to him. As an example of this reversed role of the sexes in courtship, one may cite an incident observed and photographed by Mr. Cleveland Grant. An incubating Wilson's phalarope (Ste- ganopus tricolor) flew from the nest, presumably to feed. He was immediately mobbed by three ardent females of the species and forced to alight and take refuge on the ground. In the button-quail (Turnix) the females are so aggressive and pugnacious that, as noted by Darwin (op. cit., 487), they were kept by the natives of India for fighting, like gamecocks. In the painted snipe (Rostratula) the female has the trachea, which is associated with the (courtship) notes, more convoluted than in the male, a unique situation among the few birds in which dimorphism occurs in this structure. In the groups mentioned there is thus a com- plete reversal of much of the behavior associated with reproduction and, with it, of the secondary sexual characters including size. In other words, the females are larger because they, not the males, compete for mates. The basic reason or reasons for the reversal of the behavior seem to be undiscovered. In shore birds (Scolopacidae) other than the pha- laropes and painted snipes, all stages of incipient reversal may be observed, but without providing a clue as to the selective advantages. Indeed, the shore birds are perhaps the most interesting family of birds as regards sexual size dimorphism ranging, as they do, from species in which the female is dominant and larger to others such as the pectoral sandpiper (Erolia melanotos) in which the male is much the larger, or even to one, the ruff (Philomachus), in which the larger, highly dimorphic males gather on a display ground or lek like some grouse. Beebe, Hartley and Howes (1917) and Beebe (1925) studied the breeding habits of various tinamous in British Guiana. Roosevelt (1917: xi) summarized their findings, as regards a small tinamou of the genus Crypturus [= Crypturellus] as follows: its nesting habits are extraordinary, for the male makes the nest, stays with it until he can persuade a roving female to drop an egg in it, and then hatches the egg and rears the chick, while the female goes off; and as soon as the chick is fairly grown the male finds another temporary mate of advanced feministic views.</page><page sequence="4">534 DEAN AMADON [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. Beebe (1925: 202) estimated that in one of the small species involved, C. variegatus, males out- number females by four to one. He found a male incubating an egg but still accompanied by a three-fourths grown chick, which he had presumably just reared. On the other hand, the polyandrous female is believed to court and to lay an egg for several (how many is not known) different niales. In view of this unbalanced sex ratio, the polyandrous habits and reversal of parental care are probably adaptive. This is the more true since, as Skutch (1949: 434) has suggested, one of the possible advantages of a small brood size in the tropical jungle is to reduce the toll taken by the many predators which are attracted by successive visits to a nest, or by the calls of a parent bird keeping a brood together. Nevertheless, in a larger tinamou (T. major) of the same region, although the male incubates and cares for the young, the clutch size is 6 or 8 and the female may not be polyandrous. Mayr (1939) has shown that birds of peculiar mating habits such as Crypturellus variegatus are apt to have unbalanced sex ratios. The sex ratio is adapted by natural selection to the breed- ing habits of the species, or may be in some cases. The button-quails (Turnicidae) are also said to have polyandrous mating habits similar to those of the small tinamou, though the female lays more than one egg for each of her successive mates. It is now known that in several woodpeckers (Picidae), both New and Old World, the male assumes an increasing share and sometimes all of the care of the young as they grow older. It would be interesting to study the family to determine whether such behavior is in any way correlated with degree of sexual dimorphism. Cursory examination of the measurements pro- vided by Ridgway (1914) for the North American species indicates that the male is usually slightly larger than the female, but that the reverse may be true in some of the sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus) and perhaps of the ivory-bills (Campephilus, Scopaneus [= Phloeoceastes]). In the genus Centropus of the cuckoos (Cucu- lidae) the males are smaller than the females and are believed to perform the incubation. The sexes are alike in color. There are a few other groups or families of birds in which the female is the larger sex, but for reasons that are unknown or disputed. In all of these the male is the more brightly colored (when there is a difference) and is the more active of the sexes in courtship. Hence the reason for the reversal of size is obviously dif- ferent from that in the families just discussed. Among the songbirds, Oscines, which include more than half of all the species of birds, the female is larger perhaps only in a few aberrant flowerpeckers (Dicaeidae) of the genera Melano- charis and Rhamphocharis (Mayr and Amadon, 1947: 13-14). In R. crassirostris, in which the distinction is greatest, the wing of the male averages 66 mm., that of the female 73. The male is the more brightly colored of the sexes, in Melanocharis at least, as in other dicaeids. Nothing is known of the life histories of these birds that provides a clue as to the reasons for the reversal of the size in the sexes. As noted earlier, the female is also larger than the male in some species of hummingbirds. It may be that in these tiny creatures speed and maneuverability are more important to the males than size or strength. The same might be true of some small fishes in which the males are-like those of hummingbirds-small, bril- liantly colored, and pugnacious. Another group of birds in which the males are usually smaller than the females is the birds of prey: the Falconiformes (hawks, eagles, etc.), the Strigiformes (owls), the predatory group of gull-like birds Stercorariidae (skuas), and the Fregatidae (man-o'-war birds) which are piratical relatives of the pelicans. In most species of these unrelated groups the female exceeds the male in size, but for reasons largely unknown the extent varies from species to species, sometimes even within the same genus. In the common barn owl (Tyto alba), for example, the sexes are of about the same size, but in the closely allied grass owl (T. capensis) a mated pair from Luzon, Philippine Islands, collected by the author weighed: male, 360 grams; fe- male, 582 grams. The male thus weighed only 62 per cent as much as the female. In those species in which the sexes differ in color the males are usually more colorful or, at any rate, further removed from the primitive immature type of coloration than are the females. In some crested eagles the smaller male has the longer crest. An example is the Japanese hawk-eagle, Spizaetus nipalensis orientalis. In one hawk, Accipiter fasciatus vigilax, for which I happen to have compiled data (Amadon, 1943: 168), 10 males averaged 269 grams; 5 females, 477 grams. Thus the dimorphism is as pronounced as that</page><page sequence="5">VOL. 103, NO. 4,1959] SEXUAL DIFFERENCES IN SIZE AMONG BIRDS 535 of the opposite type found in such birds as turkeys. Several theories have been advanced as to why the females of birds of prey are larger, but none is very convincing. Schmidt-Bey (1913: 414) made a suggestion similar to that proposed above for hummingbirds: namely, that male birds of prey fight in such a way that maneuver- ability and speed in climbing above an adversary are more important than strength. Instead of fighting it out on the ground in the manner of gamecocks, they seek to spiral above one another in the air and then to make passes at each other with the talons. It is doubtful, however, whether this is true of all the birds of prey- some owls, for instance-in which the female is the larger. In some birds of prey the female stays at the nest more or less constantly after the young hatch, and the male brings food for both his mate and young. It has been suggested by several writers (e.g., Brull, 1937, quoted in Hagen, 1942) that the lesser size of the male better fits him for securing the smaller creatures that are fed to the newly hatched nestlings. Later, when the young are approaching full growth, the adult female becomes active in the foraging and will, on the average, secure larger prey. It is difficult to say whether this expla- nation is valid. The female is certainly capable of tearing up larger prey for the young, though perhaps smaller prey is more suitable. Hagen (1942: 148) in his perceptive study of this question has made another suggestion, one which had also occurred to me. In birds of prey the foraging instincts and the parental instincts are more or less in conflict. It is said, for example, that, if the young of the great skua (Catharacta skua) chance to leave the nest, which is on the ground, when they are small, their parents may kill and eat them as they would any other prey species. Hence the male of birds of prey, in which the parental instincts are weaker than in the female, may represent a threat to the young especially when they are small. The larger and fiercer female stays with the young and prevents cannibalism from be- coming prevalent-it already is known to occur from time to time. In any event, the reversed size dimorphism in birds of prey seems definitely to be correlated with their predatory habits. In all three non- predatory, vulturelike or scavenging relatives of the birds of prey-namely, the Old World vultures (members of the same family Acci- pridae as the hawks), the New World vultures (Cathartidae), and the caracaras (members of the falcon family Falconidae)-the dominant size of the female has disappeared to a greater or lesser degree along with the predatory habits. Indeed, in some of them, such as the South American condor (Vultur) and the griffon vul- ture of Europe (Gyps), the male is the larger. Yet it is very probable that all three of these groups of scavengers are derivatives of typical birds of prey. Professor Erwin Stresemann has pointed out to me that the dimorphism in the birds of prey is greatest, perhaps, in two bird-catching groups of different families; namely, the accipiters, already cited, and some of the falcons, such as Falco peregrinus. On the other hand, in some of the largely insect-eating falcons such as the kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), the superiority in size of the female is much less. It is doubtful, however, whether there is any real correlation with bird-catching. The harpy eagle (Harpia), for example, certainly does not catch birds in flight; yet the female is much larger than the male. Likewise in the owls (Tyto) mentioned above, the Philippine species, like T. alba, feeds mostly on rodents. The frigate or man-o'-war birds (Fregatidae) would repay study as regards sexual dimorphism. The male is smaller than the female and more brightly colored, with his scarlet gular sac, which is inflated in courtship. These characteristics suggest comparison with the true birds of prey. But the male frigate bird is said to perform most of the incubation and care of the young, which one would not expect. SUMMARY Sexual size dimorphism in birds, as first stated by Darwin, is believed to be based on selection for increased size resulting from competition for mates, usually by males but with some out- standing exceptions. The dimorphism is greater in polygamous and promiscuous species, because here the males need not be as numerous as females and, hence, more extreme secondary sexual characters can be tolerated. Many unexplained examples or aspects of sexual size dimorphism among birds are known, and several of them are cited in this paper. Their study and analysis may be expected to</page><page sequence="6">536 DEAN AMADON [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. provide further instances of the sensitivity of the organism to natural selection.
