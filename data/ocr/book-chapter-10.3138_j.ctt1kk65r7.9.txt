<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Christian P. Weber Elective Affinities / Wahlverwandtschaften 4 Elective Affinities / Wahlverwandtschaften:  The Career of a Metaphor christian p.  weber The relationship between poetry and science seems intuitively clear. They  appear to be distinct from each other through mutual exclusion. Whereas  poetic fiction expresses subjective ideas by imaginatively combining  images and words and realizing them through the creation of mythical  or literary worlds, scientific investigation – at least according to its com- mon modern understanding – aims for the objective representation of  knowledge by rigorously excluding anything that can be associated with  fiction.1 Whereas poets virtually transcend in imaginary flights the “real”  world and thus the material basis of science, scientists arrive at facts as the  result of strictly controlling their imagination, reducing nature to a spe- cifically defined subject matter, and comparing the data of measurements.  Yet, the presumption of this mutual exclusion is challenged by problems  of distinction within each domain: How can scientists set aside subjective  impulses? What determines the subject matter of a scientific investigation?  What counts essentially as “matter” and what should be labelled just as  evidence or inference? On what “objective” basis can these decisions and  distinctions be made? And vice versa: poetic fiction requires and relies on  commonly shared factual knowledge about the world in order to be able  to articulate meaning and facilitate understanding. How else could a poeti- cal, genuinely imaginary world come into existence if not by drawing its  material from the “real,” which is, to a certain degree, a scientifically struc- tured world? Eventually, poetry needs to manifest its alternative ideas by  leaving a material trace and having a “real” impact on peoples’ lives. These  probing questions defy the clear-cut distinction between “facts” and “fic- tion” so that, ultimately, the heuristic status of these concepts themselves  oscillates between fact and fiction. Once this distinction has been blurred,  fiction turns into fact and fact (re)turns into(as) fiction. </page> <page sequence="2"> 98 Christian P. Weber In light of this problem of definition, the following essay argues that  the transmutability or translatability between scientific fact and poetic  fiction is actually not only possible or unavoidable, but even desired for  the progress of both (seemingly mutually exclusive) human activities.  On the one hand, poetry can find inspiration in new scientific discov- eries for the invention of innovative metaphors and visions of alterna- tive (utopian) worlds. On the other hand, the strict focus of science on  factual analysis encounters at some point limits of insight and overview  over all facts and relations. At this point, science often reverts to poetic  ideas and figurative language in order to breach new avenues of research  and eventually to reach a more comprehensive, higher theoretical level  of understanding. In fact, as Evelyn Fox Keller has recently argued,  language, and more specifically figurative language, is the common  denominator and mediator through which the opposite trajectories of  science and poetry are interconnected and interact: Scientific research is typically directed at the elucidation of entities and  processes about which no clear understanding exists, and to proceed, sci- entists must find ways of talking about what they do not know – about that  which they as yet have only glimpses, guesses, speculations. To make sense  of their day-to-day efforts, they need to invent words, expressions, forms  of speech that can indicate or point to phenomena for which they have no  literal descriptors ... Making sense of what is not yet known is thus neces- sarily an ongoing and provisional activity, a groping in the dark; and for this,  the imprecision and flexibility of figurative language is indispensable. (Fox  Keller, Making Sense of Life 118) Fox Keller’s statement responds to the mysterious processes of genetic  evolution as well as the phenomenal and thus conceptual instability of the  term “gene.” Yet her astute observation is hardly new, and neither are the  described methodic problems that challenge modern biogenetic research.  In fact, the situation is very reminiscent of the beginnings of modern chem- istry, when Lavoisier redefined the term “element” to bring order into the  otherwise confusing mixes and matches of chemical substances. Yet even  this great French chemist, the embodiment of a rational and rationalist  modern scientist, continued to operate with the anthropomorphic and  alchemistic metaphor “elective affinities” to characterize – rather than just  describe – the mysterious “motivation” of chemical reactions. As this chapter will show, “elective affinity” has been an attractive met- aphor for many other scientific discourses as well, especially at the turn  </page> <page sequence="3"> Elective Affinities / Wahlverwandtschaften 99 from the eighteenth to the nineteenth century, and it continues to be so  even today. The following case study traces the career of this metaphor  as it transgresses the divide between matter and idea (spirit), fact and fic- tion, science and poetry. For each discourse that resorts to this metaphor,  it aims to describe the gains (in insight) or losses (of sight) by using it.  Or, to approach this matter from the opposite direction in recognition  of the intrinsic power that Hans Blumenberg ascribed to metaphors, the  chapter aims to figure out what sort of lifestyle – understood as the will  and desire to (trans)form life in a certain fundamental manner – this par- ticular metaphor has empowered and how it has changed the world.2 The  metaphor of “elective affinities” is particularly interesting for the study of  these questions because it circulated in almost every discourse around the  time of the French Revolution and because there is a pre-eminent literary  work that emerged as a critical response to the pressing task of reflect- ing the aforementioned issues in light of the great transformations that  this world-historic event has brought about. As I argue in the following,  Goethe created his novel Die Wahlverwandtschaften,3 published in 1809,  (literally) as a poetical experiment to systematically explore the funda- mental relations that its title metaphor has entertained by shaping various  scientific discourses and even inspiring new socio-political programs and  cultural life forms. However, I pursue here a different strategy than deliv- ering a plain interpretation of the (supposedly) scientific content of this  literary work, bearing in mind Helmut Müller-Sievers’s warning: Literary texts do not contain scientific theorems as their subject matter, and  science is not in need of the support of literary ornamentation ... Unless the  analysis can show how science informs the literary text, unless it raises sci- ence from the unfathomable depth of the content to the surface of writing,  unless the writing of science crosses over into the science of writing, the rela- tionship between literature and science will always remain anecdotal at best.  (Self-Generation 9–10) This statement serves as a methodological guideline of my undertaking.  My first and primary concern of analysis regards scientific, supposedly  non-fictional texts that employ the metaphor of “elective affinities.” Only  after the specific meaning or significance of “elective affinities” has been  established for each particular discourse, such as geology, chemistry, biol- ogy, and the social sciences, will I turn to Goethe’s novel in order to see  how – if at all – these uses or abuses of the metaphor to produce scientific  “facts” influence the world view and belief of the fictive characters that  </page> <page sequence="4"> 100 Christian P. Weber then transform the poetic, pseudo-real world they inhabit. By separat- ing as much as possible the utilization of the metaphor in the scientific  discourses – or more specifically the associations and relations that were  established as a result of that – from the poetic renegotiation of them by  the novel, the essentially critical (and in that sense also “scientific”) capac- ity of literature comes to light. Die Wahlverwandtschaften appears then  as a meta-discourse that translates the “scientific” workings of its title  metaphor into literary action. In the virtual reality of the novel, the char- acters embody and literarily “act out” the effects and consequences that  the utilization of “elective affinities” has shown in various discourses.  Ultimately, I argue, the poetic imagination not only invigorates scientific  investigation by creating metaphors when the senses or instruments of  observation have reached their limits, but also provides the means by con- structing a literary simulacrum to test and critically assess the transforma- tive power the same metaphors potentially can or actually do exercise in  the real lifeworld.4 “Just one nature”: Goethe’s Poetics of the Simile Before inquiring into the poetics of the various scientific discourses that  employ the metaphor of “elective affinities,” a short excursion into what  may be called the metaphysics of Goethe’s poetics helps one to under- stand the issue in a wider context. The author addressed the complex of  metaphoric transference and substitution when he announced the publica- tion of his new novel Die Wahlverwandtschaften, apparently as part of a  strategy to not only explain but also reinforce the overall strategy of this  literary project: It seems that the author has been inspired to choose this strange title by his  continued scientific studies. He may have realized that in natural sciences one  very often employs ethical analogies/similes [ethische Gleichnisse] to bring  closer phenomena that are quite remote from the circle of human knowledge;  and so, presumably, he also wanted, in a moral case, to trace back a chemical  figure of speech [chemische Gleichnisrede] to its spiritual origin, all the more  so since there is just one nature, and also since the realm of serene reason and  freedom is unavoidably marked by the traces of opaque, passionate necessity.  These may only be completely erased by a higher hand, and then probably  not in this life. (Goethe, “Notiz” in Cotta’s Morgenblatt für gebildete Stände,  FA 1.8: 974)5 </page> <page sequence="5"> Elective Affinities / Wahlverwandtschaften 101 Goethe plays here a self-ironic game with the author role, and further  plays a trick on the reader. If this piece had ever been intended as adver- tisement, it must have strangely missed its purpose. Its pretentious specu- lation creates the illusion of a meta-author who reads the author’s mind,  which is rather off-putting to a reader who is left clueless about the plot of  this much-anticipated novel. The position assumed here mimics the ironic  position of the narrator in the novel, so that the announcement can be  understood as an ironically read statement of an altogether ironic novel,  thus highlighting the irony and virtual reality of the whole project. Inter- estingly, Goethe associates this narrative strategy with the novel’s “strange  title,” which he is most concerned to justify and clarify. Yet, he does not  simply explain the origin, meaning, or significance of the crucial metaphor;  he rather enacts its effects. In most condensed and stylized form, the text is  composed as an intricate play of subtle figurative correlations and attrac- tions that virtually connect concepts that are semantically far apart so that  opposite meanings almost seem to belong to one and the same phenome- nal complex – although their relation remains, of course, only a virtual one  due to the effect of rhetorical “elective affinities.” The whole text is held  together by a dialectics of expanding versus retracting and displacing ver- sus longing (“fortgesetzt,” “weit Entferntes näher heranzubringen,” “zu  ihrem geistigen Ursprung zurückführen mögen”); the distance between  ‘the close” and “the far” is bridged by analogical structures such as paral- lelism (e.g., “nur eine Natur” – “nur durch eine höhere Hand”), oppo- sition (e.g., “heiter[e] Vernunft-Freiheit“ versus “trübe, leidenschaftliche  Notwendigkeit“), and chiasm (“Naturlehre” – “ethische Gleichnisse” vis- à-vis “sittliche[r] Fall” – “chemische Gleichnisrede“). The rhetorical rela- tions among the textual components thus simulate the immanent workings  of elective affinities and yet their exposed artistry also reveals and hints at  their making by a hidden, transcendent author. (To that effect, Goethe did  not identify himself as the drafter of this announcement.) Ultimately, however, all of this play serves just the purpose of illustrating  the main idea of this text as well as of the novel and Goethe’s holistic Welt- anschauung, namely, that there is “just one nature” which springs from a  “spiritual origin.” For Goethe, the origins of nature and ingenious culture  are essentially identical.6 Since the “spiritual origin” of the physical world –  of which the light of the sun is seen as the purest emanation – remains sci- entifically inaccessible, humans resort to their own minds and explore the  origin of their spirituality and creativity. In two consecutive letters to his  friend Knebel, who was working on a translation of Lucretius’s De rerum  </page> <page sequence="6"> 102 Christian P. Weber natura at the time, Goethe characterizes the imagination as a faculty that  even trumps natural light in its capability to illuminate the physical world: Lucretius’s high rank as one of the most distinguished poets of all times is  the result of his highly productive skill of sensory perception, which makes  him capable of vigorous representations, and further of his lively imagina- tion, which allows him to track the perceived objects even beyond the reach  of the senses down to the imperceptible depths of nature and most secretive  recesses. (14 February 1821, HA Briefe 3: 499) In the following letter, Goethe distinguishes three types of imagination:  the first he names “reproductive” (nachbildend), which coordinates the  various sensory faculties in the effort of mimetic representation. Provided  that this happens without the involvement of the mind, one may also call  it the intuitive imagination. It produces pure images that are “true” in the  sense of verisimilitude. This ideal of “objective” representation of natural  things also serves as a fundamental criterion to determine scientific truth.  The other essential quality that Goethe assigns to the great poet of nature  is associated with the second type of imagination that he calls “produc- tive” (productiv). Reaching beyond the senses, the productive imagina- tion also engages the mind and creates concepts. (A concept is whole yet  abstract, whereas an image is concrete yet only represents an aspect of the  thing.) Only in the sphere of symbolic signification and conceptual under- standing does the imagination surpass the level of purely “objective” per- ception and reach an “idea” of truth beyond verisimilitude that is either  informed by the categorical logic of the mind as well as the fundamental  maxims of reason (philosophical truth) or by the analogical procedure of  the imagination (poetical truth).7 However, when the productive imagina- tion seeks analogies just within the symbolic sphere of language or with  relation to cultural phenomena, it acts outside of its genuine field of com- petence where it is at the risk of establishing artificial relations and forging  metaphors without “real” substance. (Such kind of “truth” is not poetic,  but merely rhetorical, especially when it fulfils an ideological purpose.)  Hence, to “really” create poetic truth and true poetry, a mediating third  type of imagination must come into play that reconnects and constantly  renegotiates the abstract symbolic meaning of words with the more con- crete images of natural things: Moreover we can assume the existence of a circumspective [umsichtige] imag- ination, which surveys and takes hold of the same and the like during speech  in order to test the validity of what has been said. </page> <page sequence="7"> Elective Affinities / Wahlverwandtschaften 103 Here now appears the desirability of analogy [Analogie], which places  [versetzt] the spirit [Geist] onto many related points of interest so that it can  reunite everything that belongs and harmonizes together [alles das Zusam- mengehörige, das Zusammenstimmende wieder vereinige]. This immediately generates similes/allegories [Gleichnisse], which are  more valuable the closer they come to match the object that they were sup- posed to illuminate. The most valuable, however, are those that cover the  object completely and seem to become identical with it. (21 February 1821,  HA Briefe 3: 501) In the simile a long series of substitutions and displacements culminates  that, to a certain degree, are unavoidable in the human effort to form knowl- edge and cultivate the world: images substitute things,8 concepts substitute  and displace images, and tropes substitute and displace concepts by a figu- rative recombination of the relationships between images and concepts.  The simile must be considered – as it has been since ancient time9 – a special  type of metaphor. For Goethe, it retains special cultural importance as the  product of the circumspective imagination, which he regards highest, since  it combines both reproductive (the observance of images) and produc- tive (the making of concepts) faculties in the act of forming a valid speech  or rapport (“Vortrag”). Different from the rather spontaneous fusion of  image and concept in the metaphor, the simile is more reflective. In creat- ing it, the poetic “spirit” reverts to sense perception (and the making of  images) in an effort to review linguistic concepts and metaphoric tropes.  By determining their relationship to natural things, the analogical poetics  of the simile reassesses the imagination’s substitutions and displacements  and performs a critique of the human language. As such, the simile also  fulfils a scientific (empirical, analytic) and philosophical (critical, yet syn- thetic) purpose.10 At the same time, the imagination has accomplished its  genuine poetic task by establishing a symbolic harmony between concepts  and images that mirrors the “original” intuitive harmony between images  and things. With the creation of a truly “objective” simile, the imagination  has returned to the exploratory spirit of its reproductive origin. By accom- plishing an analogical identity of all its cognitive modes of representation  (image, concept, and trope) in the simile, it collapses the differences and  distinctions among them into one poetic totality and thereby completes  one cycle of its formation.11 The simile thus brings a (temporary) end and  relief to the “daemonic” process of fragmenting and dividing the world  in images, concepts, and metaphors. By creating one “apocalyptic” poetic  vision, it reveals in a momentous epiphany that “there is just one nature.” </page> <page sequence="8"> 104 Christian P. Weber In the sense described above, the famous “Gleichnisrede” (figurative  speech) of the Wahlverwandten (elective relatives) certainly is no Gleich- nis, or simile, whereas the novel as a whole is. Exemplary for their funda- mental misunderstanding of the true character of the simile is Eduard’s  conclusion of the playful conversation, which revolved around various  possibilities of how the metaphor of “elective affinities” may be applied  to their situation: “Eduard interjected [fiel ein]: Now then! Until we will  see all this before our eyes, we shall regard this formula as a parable [Glei- chnisrede], which shall serve us as a teaching to our immediate benefit”  (1.4; 118).12 Everything that matters in the creation process of a true poetic  simile is here turned inside out: the reflexivity of speech is perverted by  the suddenness of Eduard’s idea to declare a simile; sensory perception is  replaced by speculative anticipation; the natural object of analogical com- parison is here merely an abstract formula; finally, Eduard remains blind  for the intrinsic poetic “value” of the simile, its esoteric vision of oneness;  instead, he simply wants to utilize this “teaching” as a sort of legitima- tion to promote his immediate interests and practical human affairs, which  bring about only further substitutions, displacements, and divisions. Eduard’s confused character disqualifies him from ever gaining an  understanding of the simile, not to mention an appreciation for its poetic  vision. His “daemonic” imagination is only productive, constantly creat- ing hollow metaphors without a foundation in the “real.” (To the contrary,  his wife Charlotte’s imagination is primarily reproductive and driven by  the compulsion to make up for lost opportunities in the past.) The only  character in the novel that appears to be capable of creating true simi- les is the old gardener, who is introduced already in the first chapter as  the positive antagonist to Eduard. Whereas we first encounter the “rich  baron” preoccupied with the “business” of inoculating grafts onto “young  rootstocks” (1.1; 93), which serves as a symbol for his appropriating and  greedy character, the gardener contains himself as a sympathetic observer  of this scene.13 Other than his selfish master, who perceives things only  with pleasure as long as he has invested an interest in them, he appears  to be capable of just enjoying the uninterested panning of his view “in a  serene distance” (ibid.).14 Such an attitude is the precondition for the cre- ation of a poetic simile (an extraordinary example of which is represented  in the next section). The gardener also serves as a mirroring figure of the  narrator, whose omnipresence is immediately felt. He introduces him- self as a tertiary meta-observer, as one who observes how the gardener  observes Eduard observing. The overall task of his circumspective imagi- nation is to fully comprehend and observe the consequences of some  </page> <page sequence="9"> Elective Affinities / Wahlverwandtschaften 105 dubious actions and transactions by the novel’s protagonists. Ultimately,  the narrator describes the eventually tragic logic of displacements that has  been set in motion by the misunderstanding and dubious application of  the metaphor of “elective affinities,” as was demonstrated by the “figura- tive speech” in paragraph 1.4. Later on in the novel (in paragraph 2.9), it is  revealed that the conservative gardener judges Eduard’s excessive grafting  and the production of entirely ornamental plants as highly dubious. Grafting means in this context not simply a horticultural practice, but  represents a specific biological type of “elective affinities.” The next sections  discuss how this metaphor is used by various, predominantly scientific,  discourses. At the same time, it symbolizes the very structure (or “nature”)  of the metaphor as such. If the narrator of Die Wahlverwandtschaften –  respectively the author, whose insightful comments constitute another  level of (self-)critical observation that I consider an essential part of this  whole poetic enterprise – intended, as I argue, the creation of a modern  meta-simile about this metaphor, his vision must comprehend and con- tain its wide range of uses, consequences, meanings, and overall cultural  significance. The task of interpretation is then to trace back the analogical  (metaphoric) relations between scientific discourses and poetry that bridge  nature and human culture and to reconstruct how Goethe reconciles the  tensions of this uneasy relationship in the simile, that is, the novel. First Discourse: Geology Goethe renders a superb poetic example of his theory of the simile in his  equally scientific fragments on granite.15 Although this group of texts does  not employ the metaphor “elective affinity” directly, it provides a spec- ulative, geological explanation for the origin of affinities in the material  world, or rather, to be more precise, for the attraction of geological and  especially chemical discourses to the genealogical concept of “affinity”  (translated as Verwandtschaft). The first fragment (subtitled Granit I) describes granite as a rock that  exhibits the widest range of both spatial/vertical and temporal dimensions.  Goethe imagines that, in primordial times, it was the “deepest” layer hid- den in the earth, whereas it appears to be now the highest and most exposed  layer of all geological formations. Goethe’s curiosity is further sparked by  the observation that granite is a composite of at least two different particles.  Intriguingly, they seem to be “not joined together by something third, but  to coexist side by side and to adhere just to themselves” (FA 1.25; 311).  Although this natural phenomenon certainly invites speculation, Goethe  </page> <page sequence="10"> 106 Christian P. Weber adheres in the closing remark of this piece to his rock-solid and steadfast  scientific principle of objective reasoning:16 “My spirit has no wings to  uplift itself to those primordial beginnings. I stand firmly on the granite  and inquire the rock whether it would give us any reason to reflect about  the consistency of the mass that made it” (FA 1.25: 312). The subsequent  fragment (Granit II), however, contradicts this judgment by rendering one  of the most ecstatic moments of poetic-scientific inspirations. Goethe first  recalls that granite was considered even in the “most ancient times” to be  a very “mysterious [merkwürdige] type of rock” and that its “monstrous  [ungeheuren] masses were an inspiration for the Egyptians with their ideas  of monstrous [ungeheuren] buildings” (FA 1.25: 312). After this historical  reflection, he recollects the scientific knowledge of his time, which amounts  to the “fact” that granite is both “the highest and lowest” layer of rock and  therefore the “foundation of our earth” (FA 1.25: 313).17 Feeling the insuf- ficiency of this knowledge and the “passion” to explore the deeply hid- den secrets of the earth, he introduces a metaphysical premise that opens a  new avenue to poetic-scientific exploration. Similarly to his announcement  of the Wahlverwandtschaften above, Goethe states that “all natural things  entertain an exact relationship with each other,” which implies that even the  “human heart” as the most recent, fickle, and sensitive product and granite  as “the oldest, hardest, deepest, and firmest son of nature” are intercon- nected and that one may be accessed by means of the other (FA 1.25: 313– 14). Next, Goethe performs (and renders) a poetic soliloquy of his heart  that turns into an act of “telepathic” communication, a pseudo-scientific,  investigative dialogue with the earth. While sitting on a rock of granite on  top of a mountain, he simultaneously summons the feelings in the depth of  his soul as well as the whole world below and the sky above him. (He thus  inhabits and displays a daemonic position.) Goethe takes great care in his  description to emphasize the constant interplay of the introspective voice  (“I say to myself”) with the circumspective vision (“I survey the world”).  At the climax of this experience, the inner and outer spheres coalesce and  generate a complex simile at the moment of greatest enthusiasm: In this moment, when the inner powers of the Earth seem to affect me directly  with all their forces of attraction and movement, and when the influences  of heaven hover closer around me, I am uplifted in spirit to a more exalted  view of nature. The human spirit brings life to everything and here, too, there  springs to life within me an image irresistible in its sublimity. “This mood of  solitude,” I say to myself as I gaze down from the barren peak and glimpse  a faint patch of low-growing moss far below, “this mood of solitude will  </page> <page sequence="11"> Elective Affinities / Wahlverwandtschaften 107 overcome all who desire to bring before their souls only the deepest, oldest,  most elemental feeling for the truth ... I feel the first and most abiding origin  of our existence; I survey the world with its undulating valleys and its distant  fruitful meadows, my soul is exalted beyond itself and above all of the world,  and it yearns for the heavens which are so near.” (FA 1.25: 314–15)18 Goethe feels to have almost (gleichsam) an intimate relation with the rock,  which inspires him to elaborate a complex “simile” (Gleichnis): First, he  comes to see the likeness between the vivifying “human spirit” with the  earth’s “forces of attraction and movement.” Second, he associates his  daemonic mood – oscillating between a “highly tuned” (hochgestimmte)  ecstasy and a most sober determination to explore “the deepest feelings of  truth” – with the sublime moment of the “being of all beings” immediately  after the act of Creation. The resulting sublime simile is simultaneously a  product of all his senses, of his emotion and imagination. It thereby defies  the surface of the rock and the presence of time; it accesses, conveys, and  symbolically embodies the deepest and oldest secret of nature, which is  the act of creating as such (see again the letter to Jacobi quoted above),  especially the creating of similes. The final verses of Faust sum up Goethe’s  sublime experience in the act of creating the simile, which represent per- haps his deepest insight: “Alles Vergängliche / Ist nur ein Gleichnis” (All  that is transient / Is but a simile/parable.) This highly subjective and yet, at the same time, most objective vision  informed Goethe’s ideas about geological formation as well as about  chemical composition. In the subsequent fragment (Form und Bildung des  Granits), Goethe proposes the hypothesis that all matter was originally  “united” in the “intimate solution” of “first chaos” (FA 1.25: 317–18).  Natural history means to him a still ongoing decomposition and crystalli- zation process that was set in motion once the primordial union of matter  had been disturbed. Ever since, everything has been in flux, and Goethe  seems to suggest that the constant decomposition and (re-)composition of  bodies entertain “elective affinities” because all matter and all material life  forms on earth are intrinsically driven by the quest to restore this previous  harmony.19 Granite is a remnant of earth’s prehistory, and its indestruc- tible composition strikes Goethe as a visible reminder of this original and  intimate belonging that has been lost for all the rest. “Elective affinity”  means for him essentially the expression of an essential (or even existen- tial) longing and yearning in all material “elements” (FA 1.25: 318) that  were once violently disassociated and forced to recombine in less harmo- nious compounds during the natural history of the earth. </page> <page sequence="12"> 108 Christian P. Weber I would suggest that this reasoning constitutes the foundation of the  “radical idea” which Goethe reported to have followed in the composition  of his Wahlverwandtschaften.20 Goethe mentioned in another letter that  he conceived the novel in the “Bohemian mountains” during the poeti- cally chaotic period of the Napoleonic Wars, in which he devoted a lot  of time to geological studies (Goethe to Zelter, 1 June 1809, FA 1.8: 979).  This coincidence is certainly no accident. One central theme of the novel  is marriage, and the primordial association of two different “elements”  in granite could be considered the perfect symbol for this most intimate  union between two human beings. The same analogy is actually alluded to  by the most militant defender of marriage in the novel, the ominous Mit- tler, when he says: “Marriage is both the base [Anfang] and the pinnacle  [Gipfel] of culture” (1.9: 137). Marriage thus occupies in human culture  the same place as granite in nature. However, Eduard’s and Charlotte’s  marriage proves to be anything but granite-solid. They are, as also the  novella within this novel insinuates, not quite a natural match for each  other; the intrinsic forces of “elective affinities” have a pull on them and  continue to impact their association as well as their relationships to others.  Mittler’s desperate attempts to keep the couple together must remain futile  since he acts, in fact, counter to the marriage symbol of granite, according  to which the two elements would stick together no matter what without  the need of a third, mediating person. What the couple needs are not the  orthodox moral principles of a retired priest like Mittler, who does not  even understand the basics of geology, but the recognition that the funda- mental natural laws of creation, the interplay of attraction and repulsion,  continue to have an effect even in human affairs. For that, some knowl- edge of chemistry may be a good start. Second Discourse: Chemistry The revolutionary age of chemistry, coinciding with the political revolu- tion of France, can be easily integrated as a particularly radical episode in  Goethe’s idea of natural history as an ongoing process of de- and recom- position and de- and regeneration. In the historical part of the Farben- lehre, Goethe characterizes the emerging new discipline of chemistry  accordingly: More recently, chemistry brought about a major transformation; it dis- sected natural bodies in order to artificially reassemble them in manifold  ways; it destroyed a real world to construct in its stead a so far unknown,  </page> <page sequence="13"> Elective Affinities / Wahlverwandtschaften 109 unimaginable new world. As a consequence, we were forced to reflect harder  and harder about the likely origin of all things and everything that followed  from it so that we have found ourselves confronted again and again with new  and increasingly higher types of ideas [Vorstellungsarten]. This is even more  the case since the chemist and the natural scientist have made an inseparable  pact to establish among things, which previously appeared to be units, at  least manifold relations – if not to decompose them completely otherwise –  and thus to gain from them an admirable versatility [bewundernswürdige  Vielseitigkeit]. (FA 1.23/1: 660–1) The new age of chemistry does not only immensely increase the decom- position process, but, more crucially, radically alters the constitution of  nature by forcefully breaking apart the natural substances of the “real  world” and by recombining the fragments into artificial and fantastic  composites. As Goethe points out, the unheard of possibilities of chemical  syntheses are followed up by the invention of equally creative ideas and  theories which also destroy the integrity of the spirit and intellect. Though  he personally does not favour this modern development, Goethe accepts it  as a historical fact and embraces its “admirable versatility.” But he remains  aware that this new scientific discipline also increases the potential of fur- ther displacements and forced associations, which consequently produce  new sufferings in an ever more complicated world. Under these circumstances, “elective affinities” – originally an alche- mist term – becomes an attractive metaphor for the chemical discourse  as a regulative idea. As Goethe points out, it provides the idea (and ideal)  of primordial unity and thus constrains the imagination of chemists who  may otherwise have fancied hypothetically unlimited new combinations.  Accordingly, Torbern Bergman, whom Goethe21 praises for the introduc- tion of this metaphor into the chemical discourse, stresses in his Disserta- tion on Elective Attractions “the tendency to union which is observed in  all neighboring bodies on the surface of the earth” (2).22 Arguably, Berg- man’s great use of this metaphor assigns to chemistry its specific scientific  domain by distinguishing between the chemical forces of “affinity” and  the astrophysical forces of “attraction.” Affinity, he writes, “only affects  small particles, and scarce[ly] reaches beyond contact, whereas remote  attraction extends to the great masses of matter in the immensity of space,  [which] seems to be regulated by very different  laws” (2). Even though  Bergman is aware that the laws of affinity “may perhaps depend on cir- cumstances,” he maintains that a “fixed order” must exist and that the  knowledge of the laws of “elective affinity” would provide the “key to  </page> <page sequence="14"> 110 Christian P. Weber unlock the innermost sanctuaries of nature” upon which “the whole of  chemistry rests” (9). Hence, the metaphor of “elective affinity” encapsu- lates a metaphysical program of unity. Bergman’s scientific optimism regarding the possibility of taming and  containing the versatile and transitory nature of chemical reactions, trans- formations, and circumstances is displayed in his famous affinity tables,  which compile the results of his repeated observations and experiments in  a very orderly manner. However, the ever-increasing dimensions of affin- ity tables and their failure to account for every condition and countless  exceptions reintroduce the problem of how to deal with this sheer com- plexity. In response to these concerns, Claude Louis Berthollet has argu- ably reached the highest level of scientific accuracy and methodological  reflection in his Recherches  sur  les  lois de  l’affinité,23 published in 1801,  by introducing many refinements to the guiding metaphorical principle.  Among the many innovations proposed, the most relevant one is a redefi- nition of the term “elective affinity,” which Berthollet strictly limits to  displacement reactions with three agents. For him, displacement reactions  of the “elective” type are not about a choice of alternatives, but rather  a matter of affinity in proportion to quantity: “The very term, elective  affinity must lead into error, as it supposes the union of the whole of one  substance with another, in preference to a third; whereas there is only a  partition of action, which is itself subordinate to other chemical circum- stances” (146). In other words, many examples of elective affinity cannot  be considered as completed and uniform displacements of absolute bodies.  Instead, they often showcase partitions of bodies and actions that are not  only determined by the quality of substances but also by the quantity of  their “respective [chemical] masses” (6).24 If, qua analogy, this scientific  disintegration of bodies and actions is carried over to humans and their  behaviour – which transfer the Wahlverwandtschaften seem to perform by  respective actions of the “wahlverwandten” protagonists, as I will discuss  later – then it is an assault on modern anthropological concepts such as  free will and individuality. Overall, Berthollet’s contributions to chemistry and to epistemology  are significant because they highlight the complexity and intricacy of  nature. In agreement with Goethe, Berthollet recognizes the invalidity  of Newton’s ideal of an experimentum crucis as well as the insufficiency  of conducting research within the confines of scientific disciplines. Only  the totality of sciences constitutes for him “la physique,” which brings  back to mind Goethe’s statement about the Wahlverwandtschaften,  according to which there is only one nature (“nur eine Natur”). </page> <page sequence="15"> Elective Affinities / Wahlverwandtschaften 111 Third Discourse: Biology and Physiology The red thread that interconnects the manifestations of both inorganic  and organic nature is the metaphor of “elective affinity.” By the 1790s,  after it had been employed by Lavoisier in his groundbreaking Traité  élémentaire de chimie,  this metaphor was commonly accepted as a sci- entific concept and so well established that it spread to other discourses,  including the simultaneously emerging discipline of biology. Alexander  von Humboldt, for example, uses elective affinity to distinguish the prin- ciple of organic formation from the laws of inorganic association: “We  call those bodies animated and organic that, though they tend constantly  to change into new forms, are contained by some internal force, so that  they do not relinquish that form originally introduced ... That internal  force (vim internam) which dissolves the bonds of chemical affinity and  prevents the elements of bodies from freely uniting, we call vital” (Hum- boldt, Florae  Fribergensis  specimen 133–5; qtd. in Richards, Romantic  Conception  of  Life 257). By contrast, the physician and physiologist  Johann Christian Reil25 considers Humboldt’s idea of an internal force,  which he prefers to call “life force” (Lebenskraft), not an objective qual- ity but a subjective concept, a hypothetical metaphor that helps conceive  and represent otherwise inconceivable relations and reactions. Inspired  by French modern chemistry, he aims to substitute this rather mysti- cally sounding concept with a full-fledged theory of elective affinity.26  Reil traces back the origin of organic life to elementary matter, which  he defines in accordance with Lavoisier’s famous conceptualization of  “elements” as substances “which we are not able to reduce further by  decomposition” (Reil, Von  der  Lebenskraft 6).27 However, he empha- sizes more than Lavoisier that all “elements have one unique and essential  quality in common, which is elective affinity [Wahlanziehung]” (6). And  he believes that elective affinities also determine organic matter, since it  consists to the greatest extent of inorganic matter. Living matter then  only differs from dead matter in an additional, distinctly organic “basic  material” (Grundstoff) that has certain features of “composition [Misch- ung] and form [Form],” which themselves are the resulting manifesta- tions of particular laws of elective affinity between inorganic substances  and the specific basic material: Per se, organic matter is peculiar to the organic realm and not to be found  anywhere in dead nature. And yet, the origin of organic material is securely  stored in the womb of dead nature. One must only find the core or stock of  </page> <page sequence="16"> 112 Christian P. Weber an organic being [Wesen] to which raw materials can attach themselves and  they will be organized in a purposeful order. Plants are begotten out of the  materials of dead nature and constitute, so to speak, the first level of enno- bling matter [Veredelung der Materie] into organic beings. (11) This passage serves as a great example for the desire of natural philosophers  and scientists of the eighteenth century to imagine and construct a meta- phoric bridge to cross the divisions between species and different forms of  organized matter, perhaps even to find an access to the primordial union  of all nature that also Goethe envisioned. For Reil, everything that consists  of matter is basically identical, except that organic matter displays an orga- nizing skill. He assumes that the organic core material or “stock” consists of  very “fine, perhaps entirely unknown matter” which transforms and refines  the crude matter by intermingling with it (13–14).28 Curiously, he character- izes the general form of this relationship metaphorically in terms of grafting,  which he applies to growth – the inoculation of “foreign matter” (nutrients)  onto the organic life-stock – and to plant cultivation: “We are able to engraft  a tree with scions of different kind; each scion is its own stock that attracts  the common matter, which it draws from the tree according to the laws of  its own affinity [Verwandtschaft] and by which it increases in mass from its  own kind” (42–3). Hence, grafting is the basic modus operandi, the elective  affinities of organic life forms, which is also why it is so prominently fea- tured in the opening sentence of the Wahlverwandtschaften. (The symbolic  meaning of “grafting” is discussed in the next section.) According to Reil, variants of elective affinity also occur on the level of  the human organism, which he subsumes under the heading of “sympa- thy (consensus).” He mentions that “similarities of the constitution and  composition of organs can cause the generation of sympathetic phenom- ena” that even affect remote organs: “Similar organs like nerves or blood  vessels have similar affections and similar affinities [Verwandtschaften] to  the fine matter” (62–3). Moreover, sympathetic effects can result “from  the habit and association of our motions [Bewegungen] and representa- tions [Vorstellungen]” (63). More refined human organs like the eyes and  the brain are especially palpable; they develop their faculties (e.g., vision,  understanding) by adapting to the widest range of “matter,” which they  process as information: “Almost every new idea, every new concept  changes the system of their faculties [Kräfte], intermingles with [mischt  sich] their operations and increases the potential [Kraft] of new products  in the future” (69). Thus, Reil even conceives the formation of cognition  and cultural forms essentially as manifestations of elective affinities. </page> <page sequence="17"> Elective Affinities / Wahlverwandtschaften 113 At the same time, this metaphor loses its original elementary pull the  more it is associated with intellectual and spiritual (moral) faculties. Even- tually, these higher faculties transgress and challenge the predetermined  order of the physical world by creating a symbolic order of signs that pro- duces desires beyond immediate necessity and stimulates ideas of free will  and autonomy. Human behaviour very often runs counter to the (hypo- thetical) pre-established harmony of elective affinities. In Goethe’s novel,  the actions of the Wahlverwandten Eduard and Charlotte, the Haupt- mann and Ottilie represent this basic conflict between the laws of nature  and the (more or less) rational decisions and actions of human beings.  Especially the egotistic decisions and actions of the first two institute a  series of displacements which range from grafting exotic plants onto the  native trees and soil of their grounds to the transplanting of the “delicate  plant” Ottilie, who was in Charlotte’s custodial care but is sent away to  an institution of education against her own inclination. Altogether, the  enforced actions of displacement29 result in modern biographies of suffer- ing (Werther’s theme) and in a romantic longing for love, friendship, and  community that mirrors nature’s yearning for a return to its primal state of  unity. Human history is thus a part of the general decomposition process  of natural history. Fourth Discourse: National Ideology To return once more to the discourse of physiology, Reil further suggests  that organs, which once cooperated in a “community” (Gemeinschaft),  have the inclination to form lasting associations (81). He explicitly lik- ens the organic body to the body politic of a republican state, since both  “consist of many parts that stand in a determinate relationship with one  another and contribute to the maintenance of the whole; but each part  does so through its own faculties and its own perfections, deficiencies, and  afflictions independently from the other parts of the body” (59). The body  metaphor has been often employed to illustrate the abstract idea or ideal  of the republican state, for example, to name prominent examples of the  eighteenth century, in Rousseau’s Social Contract and Schiller’s Aesthetic  Letters. As part of a rhetorical strategy, it makes “visible that which could  not be seen otherwise” (Koschorke et al., Der fiktive Staat 58), namely, the  apparatus of the state as a whole. Still invisible, however, remain the prin- ciples and fundamental program that unite and coordinate all the people  of one state by providing them with a distinct cultural and thus national  identity. </page> <page sequence="18"> 114 Christian P. Weber I suggest that, complementary to the effect of the body metaphor of the  state, biopolitical metaphors, such as “grafting” and “elective affinities,”  promote within diverse discourses an implicit programmatic idea of how  life is organized in nature and how, in turn, society should be organized  as a nation. They thereby define the national ideology that assigns only  specific cultural content to fill the abstract political form of state govern- ment.30 Concerning “grafting,” I can present here only one example for  how this metaphor has informed other discourses of national relevance,  especially in England. In his Reflections  on  the  Revolution  of  France,  Edmund Burke reminds his British readers of the unique constitutional  principle of their nation and warns them against the potential attraction  they may feel towards the newly “fabricated” one across the Channel in  France: “The very idea of the fabrication of a new government is enough  to fill us with disgust and horror. We wished at the period of the Revo- lution [in 1688], and do now wish, to derive all we possess as an inheri- tance from our forefathers. Upon that body and stock of inheritance we  have taken care not to inoculate any scion alien to the nature of the origi- nal plant” (27). For Burke, the natural “law of inheritance” must remain  the sacrosanct basis of the state, and “grafting” its national principle. He  believes that the British nation will not fall prey to the ills of modernity  and another revolution as long as it sticks to its foundational principle of  inheritance and the cultivation of blood-conscious grafting. At the same  time, his insistence on grafting indicates that he acknowledges some need  for continued national reform, but only within this clearly defined limit.  What Burke so vehemently opposes is not so much the “new government”  of France, but rather the new national idea that justifies its “fabrication,”  which is derived from another, at this time most popular, scientific meta- phor: “elective affinities.”31 It is hardly just a curious coincidence of history that the most promi- nent scientific work that made use of “elective affinities” was published  right in the centre and at the climax of the Revolution: Antoine Lavoisier’s  Traité élémentaire de chimie appeared in Paris in 1789. This major accom- plishment did not only revolutionize sciences by introducing a system of  elements and thereby articulating the clearest and most radical version of  the chemical life form. It also proposes a new scientific ethos that strives to  exclude imagination, tradition, and prejudice from the laboratory and that  accepts nothing but facts. As a consequence, Lavoisier breaks down the  appearances of organic bodies and reduces their essences until they cannot  possibly be decomposed further, which results in his famous definition of  chemical elements (as mentioned earlier). That this scientific revolution  </page> <page sequence="19"> Elective Affinities / Wahlverwandtschaften 115 is related to the political revolution has been noted by Friedrich Schlegel,  who called the French in one of his famous Athenaeum fragments a “chem- ical nation,” since in them “the chemical sense is excited more universally  than in others. Even in moral chemistry they conduct their experiments  always at a grand scale. Likewise, the age is a chemical age. Revolutions are  universal movements, not organic but chemical” (87, no. 426). But the analogy between chemistry and the French nation alludes not  only to the melting and composition of masses during the revolutionary  events, it also and perhaps even more convincingly informs about the more  critical stage of instituting and constituting a new political order. After  the most radical break from past traditions, values, and institutions, which  destroyed the “organic” self-understanding and communities of many  French people, the revolutionaries were pressured to restore order quickly.  To justify the destruction of the old aristocratic “nation,” the Revolution  demanded in its stead the implementation of a radical, anti-organic con- ception of nature as an alternative ideal life form that unites the renewed  French nation. Lavoisier’s chemical model of life and his experimental, yet  strictly rational, method provided much inspiration for the revolutionar- ies’ desire to redefine humanity in terms of their slogan “Liberty, Equal- ity, and Fraternity.” The new chemistry’s pursuit of decomposing organic  units down to elements, which are from the standpoint of objective scien- tific observation equal, correlates with the attacks of the political revolu- tion on venerable organicist traditions and socio-political hierarchies that  were grounded in the notion of natural law. As a result of events of collec- tive uprooting during the ancient regime, theoretically everybody is equal  and free to form new associations. This coincides with another important  claim of Lavoisier’s theory. He acknowledges agency in chemical elements  and recognizes their innate capability of forming associations freely, that  is, without the interference of the experimenter: “They act with regard to  us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded  until experiment and observation has proved them to be so” (4). In other  words, the analytically truthful chemist must strictly observe the principal  rights of chemical elements, namely, to regard them as equals that can asso- ciate freely and, as such, form “elective affinities.” Since these are elemen- tary rights, they should be considered universally. From here it is only a  relatively small step – although it remains an enormous jump from ele- ments to human beings, of course – to the declaration of universal human  rights and to Rousseau’s republican ideas that inspired the Revolution. The advantages of the chemical model for the (re-)formation of the  French nation are obvious: it promotes the principle of equality, which  </page> <page sequence="20"> 116 Christian P. Weber theoretically grants every human being the right to become a citizen and  to have equal opportunities, and allows for very progressive and flexible  political structures that can justify even radical transformations. However,  there are certainly also risks and dangers attached to it: First, the transfer  of materialist scientific principles to the socio-political sphere contradicts  the genuinely intersubjective and often idealist nature of human interac- tions. Social and political decisions cannot be based exclusively on mere  facts and rational factors, but are also driven by compassion and directed  by distinctly humanistic ideals. A nation that considers its citizens merely  as human “elements,” without respect for individual biographies, familial  ties, or cultural traditions, tends to approve the confiscation of private  property and the displacement of people more readily than a nation that is  governed by more organicist ideas. Second, chemical as well as social and  political experiments have often unpredictable outcomes that may result  in catastrophic explosions. To counterbalance these dangers, a “chemical”  nation is susceptible to individuals who may usurp – as the embodiment  of reason – the supervising position of the master chemist and thus inca- pacitate other people. The history of the French Revolution shows how  easily Robespierre and Napoleon Bonaparte could turn the new Republic  of France into a “laboratory” and determine the parameters for their social  and political experiments. Goethe wrote the Wahlverwandtschaften during the chaotic period of  the Napoleonic Wars, which affected his own life and caused unease to his  family and community.32 The political and social ideas that the revolution- aries and Napoleon, their culminating master chemist, experimented with  in the laboratory of the French nation are repeated and mirrored en min- iature by Eduard’s and Charlotte’s efforts to live together in the seclusion  of their estate. In their conversation about the arrival of the Hauptmann  in the first chapter, they explicitly emphasize the experimental character  of their chosen lifestyle. Charlotte remarks that “inviting the Captain does  not quite fit in with our original intentions, plans, and arrangements” (1.1;  95), and she insists that they “try [versuchen] for a time at least to see how  we can get along in this way with each other’s company” (1.1; 96). This  whole setting, which includes Eduard’s efforts of grafting and Charlotte’s  endeavour to transform the natural landscape into a “new creation” (1.1;  93), displays a willingness to experiment with nature, with their own lives  as well as with the lives of others, especially of the misplaced Hauptmann  and displaced Ottilie. Their experimental lifestyles indicate the shifts and  rifts that the Revolution has caused in the attitudes of common people.  Essentially, the Wahlverwandtschaften simulate the chemical, social, and  </page> <page sequence="21"> Elective Affinities / Wahlverwandtschaften 117 political experiments of this time in one literary meta-experiment to envi- sion what good or bad results from these tendencies. Hence, the novel aims  not only to represent but actually to (re)enact the conditions that brought  about the Revolution and the consequences that it brought about.33 Elective Affinities, “Elective Affinities,” and Elective Affinities The novel is, of course, not just about the Revolution; more fundamentally  it is about the consequences and effects – positive and negative, imaginary  and real – of the title metaphor’s inherent potential. Goethe was generally  very sensitive about the application of metaphors in scientific discourses34  and warned scientists to not confuse its artificial and to a certain degree  arbitrary status with the real natural phenomenon. Yet the phenomenal  scientific career of “elective affinities” must have awoken in Goethe a  sense of urgency to excavate the intrinsic structure and psychological logic  that make this particular metaphor so attractive and to reveal this danger- ous mechanism to a wider audience in the more popular form of the novel. For Goethe, the crux of all culture and the sciences in particular rests  in the problematic, that is, metaphoric origin of the human language in  general, as he expressed with great clarity and verve in a letter to Wilhelm  von Humboldt from 22 August 1806. This letter arguably can be consid- ered the founding document of the Wahlverwandtschaften.35 The follow- ing crucial passage stands in the context of Goethe’s review of Steffen’s  idealistic and speculative natural philosophy, which he mainly criticizes  for its “strange language” (seltsame Sprache): It was certainly due to the nature of the problem that one had to penetrate the  depth of nature with words which were based on signs from in-depth inqui- ries of other scientific and human endeavors. That way a symbolism came  about, which I don’t want to criticize, but which entails, however, some- thing highly miraculous [höchst Wunderliches] and dangerous at the same  time. The formulas of pure and applied mathematics, astronomy, cosmology,  geology, physics, chemistry, natural history, ethics, religion and mysticism  are all confused and mixed into the mass of a metaphysical [or metaphoric?]36  language which, though often used with good and great sense, will always  appear barbaric ... In this very complex and highly artificial language [as in  any language in general], very dire consequences result from the fact that  one substitutes the symbolic proxy for the thing itself and that one internal- izes the implied external relation, which loses by this replacement with fig- ures of speech [Gleichnisreden] its representative quality [Darstellung]. For  </page> <page sequence="22"> 118 Christian P. Weber example, North and South, East and West, oxygen and hydrogen are already  such phantoms of strange figures of speech [wunderliche Topik] that they  exorcize the best of our intentions. (HA Briefe 4: 484–5) In contrast to the constructive scientific-poetic simile that the circum- spective imagination has created in the Granit fragment, Goethe warns in  this passage against the potential catachrestic and eclectic use of metaphors  and allegories in the sciences, since the confusion of any symbolic repre- sentation for the “real” thing may create “whimsical figures of speech”  and consequently produce whimsical scientific results.37 (As mentioned  before, Goethe’s poetics of the simile is meant to counteract this com- mon phenomenon that we observed in the discussed scientific discourses.)  An illustrative example for such misunderstanding and misappropria- tion is presented by the famous “figure of speech” (Gleichnisrede) in the  Wahlverwandtschaften. Eduard, Charlotte, and the Hauptmann literally  enact the negative dialectic of metaphorization and further promote it by  naively transferring the metaphor of “elective affinities” to their human  affairs in the hope of making sense of them that way.38 Their conversation  ends in the fatal decision to add Ottilie to the mix simply because she fits  in the equation. It reinforces the dubious motivation of their decisions and  actions, of which the protagonists themselves seem to be subconsciously  aware: “What strange  [wunderliche] people we are” (1.2; 100), Eduard  exclaims at the beginning. And Charlotte wraps up the whole story in  an equally curious statement close to the end: “If true things are said in  strange [wunderlich] ways ..., in the end strange things [das Wunderliche]  appear as true” (2.7; 208). These remarks show the protagonists’ quest for  orientation and certainty due to the crumbling of the aristocratic culture  that experiences the decline of its political and economic status and the  depreciation of its values and norms. How the nobility responds to this  transformation is nicely reflected by one particular change of Eduard’s  habits. As the narrator reports, the baron had an inclination to entertain his  evening societies with “his lively and expressive recitation of poetry and  rhetorical pieces,” but now “he read from other texts, and for some time  had chosen by preference works on physics, chemistry and technology”  (1.4; 111). In other words, Eduard searches and yearns for a new stable  foundation on which he can rebuild his life. He seems to have found a new  life form in the metaphor of “elective affinities,” yet he does not realize  that this is just a pseudo-scientific metaphor which itself rests on instable  ground. To build a new life upon this idea just perpetuates and increases  the contingency and insecurity of his existence, as the Wahlverwandten  </page> <page sequence="23"> Elective Affinities / Wahlverwandtschaften 119 painfully experience. Their decision to complete the formula by sending  for Ottilie releases the “natural” forces of elective affinities in the human  imagination, which result in an erosion of common-sense reason and a  general detachment from reality. This has fatal consequences especially for  Eduard and Charlotte’s “fantastically” conceived “Wunderkind” Otto,  whose facial appearance shows a striking resemblance to both Ottilie and  the Hauptmann and who dies due to the collective neglect of all four “elec- tive relatives.” Through his death he becomes the “living allegory”39 of the  negative dialectic of “elective affinities,” both of the “real” imaginary play  of the protagonists’ fantasies and the just imagined power that has been  attributed to it in terms of pseudo-scientific metaphor. With regard to the latter, the uses of it in scientific and socio-political  discourses reduce the physical complexity of the respective phenomena by  providing a supposedly simple and quick explanation where actually there  may be none. At the same time, its use also unnecessarily complicates  research by inventing associations between in fact unrelated phenomena.  Hence, metaphors may not just open up innovative avenues for future sci- entific inquiry, as was argued here in the opening paragraph, but also have  the opposite effect of obscuring and mystifying issues that would require  further empirical investigation. Berthollet’s contributions to chemistry  were so important – not least to Goethe – because his Recherches high- lighted this concern. He argued, as we have seen, that chemical reactions  are caused or altered by many contingent factors, which reveal the limit of  elective affinity as a formal measure, based on the general assumption that  certain elements have specific qualities and thus entertain certain relations  with other elements accordingly. But that even Berthollet was not yet  ready to disregard this basic assumption and completely dismiss this meta- phor, which instead continued to enjoy popularity in almost every newly  emerging scientific discipline, is a symptomatic reaction to the enormous  increase of complexity and contingency around 1800. Biopolitical meta- phors are attractive because they provide or rather pretend pseudo-  scientific guidance; as such, they introduce a kind of new mythology with  increasingly national and nationalistic implications. But how shall one deal with the emergence of ever more complex subject  matters when even the sciences fail and when one remains sceptical against  national ideologies? How is a representation of dynamic processes and  transformative developments – both in society at large and in the psyche  of individuals – at all possible? I argue that Goethe’s poetics of the simile,  as it manifests in the novel Die Wahlverwandtschaften, responds to this  very issue by employing poetic strategies that reflect the three modes of  </page> <page sequence="24"> 120 Christian P. Weber the imagination discussed earlier. First, like the reproductive imagination,  it is the author’s ambition to render a realistic representation of the situa- tion, attitudes, and actions of the aristocratic society around 1800, which  is essentially characterized by its desperate attempt to integrate itself into  the emerging civil society. This notion has been noted by many contem- porary readers.40 Second, the action of the novel equals the actions of the  main protagonists Eduard and Charlotte, whose productive imagination  is informed by the title metaphor – though at first negatively. To salvage  their marriage – basically to escape from the pull of the “real” elective  affinities as they manifest themselves, for example, in sexual attraction –  they decide to live secluded from society and to unite their otherwise  drifting apart personalities by creating for themselves a perfect environ- ment. For the realization of this common project, they radically alter their  lifestyle and the landscape of their property by compulsively displacing  rocks, plants, and people (most notably Charlotte’s daughter Luciane and  her foster child Ottilie). Their efforts to gain control over the uncontrol- lable only increase in intensity once the Hauptmann and Ottilie come into  play. Ironically, they now try to regain composure and restrain the (real,  natural) elective affinities of their imaginative powers by implementing the  pseudo-scientific metaphor of “elective affinities” as a general principle of  orientation. (The “Gleichnisrede” of chapter 1.4 marks this turning point.)  Fighting elective affinities with “elective affinities,” they are fighting the  blindness caused by their consuming passions with the blindness of (false)  reasoning that is (mis-)informed by an unfounded, pseudo-scientific met- aphor. (Even though, it should be mentioned in parentheses, it is often the  narrator who alludes to this metaphor when reporting or rather comment- ing on their behaviour, for example, in chapter 1.7. He probably does so  to remind his audience about the importance that this metaphor plays for  their idea of shaping their lives, but also for the poetic sake of instituting  the simile.) This negative dialectic triggers a series of tragic events and  basically seals their doomed fate. At the same time, equally detrimental to their state of affairs is the fact  that the Wahlverwandten are not only losing sight of their core values and  touch with the conditions and consequences of their behaviour for their  immediate environment, but that they also take every slightest issue of  their petit community far too seriously. What Eduard and Ottilie, but also  Charlotte and the Hauptmann, are lacking most is circumspective vision.  To accomplish that, certain qualities are required like dispassionateness,  calmness, and serenity, which they do certainly not possess. The notable  exceptions in the novels are the old gardener and, of course, the above all  </page> <page sequence="25"> Elective Affinities / Wahlverwandtschaften 121 (between plot and author) hovering narrator. His display of circumspective  vision satisfies the third requirement for the accomplishment of a poetic  simile, which Goethe himself associated with the Wahlverwandtschaften  in another of his many insightful statements about his novel: Man encounters problems everywhere, yet he is incapable of ignoring a single  one, which is fair enough, since otherwise research would stop. However,  we should not take the positive too seriously, but transcend it with irony in  order to recognize the characteristics of the problem. After exhausting years  of dealing with Berthollet in the Wahlverwandtschaften, the public is now as  unwilling to accept his science as my novel.41 Irony functions for Goethe as a poetic strategy to represent serious and  complex problems without direct engagement and entanglement. The abil- ity to transcend the pressing problems, to hover above them and to compre- hend them in one big picture is a quality that distinguishes the true poet42 as  much as the true scientist43 from the mere actors and spectators of the world.  Peter Schwartz aptly noticed the affinity of Goethe’s “ideal of morally neu- tral contemplation (Schauen)” with Spinoza’s ultimate philosophical goal to  strive for an “adequate knowledge of the formal essence of things” (After  Jena 214). This perspective is reflected also in the narrator of the novel,  who presents us, without compromising the complexity of the issue, only  traits of characters that are essential for the demonstration of the unfolding  effects and consequences of “elective affinities” in human relations. To facilitate such a critical perspective is a very important function and  accomplishment of modern poetry. The novel is a favourable genre to con- tain and represent the complexities of modern life, because it possesses the  poetic capacity to associate a wide range of discourses and to condense  them in graphic manner. Goethe also associated his novel with a container  or barrel (“faßlich”)44 through which he expresses his desire to counteract  the fragmenting tendencies of modernity and the emerging dissociation of  nature into scientific disciplines by resynthesizing nature in one text. Die  Wahlverwandtschaften thus exercises a critical meta-discourse about the  uses of its title metaphor in scientific discourses and human life as much  as it executes a poetic simile, a super-realistic Gleichnis that does not rep- resent reality, but rather recreates a virtual model of reality based on some  essential parameters. Astonishingly, Goethe’s poetic ambition is matched or even trumped  today by some vanguard scientists, who write computer programs to  simulate and study complex environments and evolutionary processes in  </page> <page sequence="26"> 122 Christian P. Weber virtual realities. According to Christopher Langston, “the ultimate goal of  the study of artificial life would be to create ‘life’ in some other medium,  ideally a virtual medium where the essence of life has been abstracted from  the details of its implementation in any particular model. We would like  to build models that are so life-like that they cease to become models of  life and become examples of life themselves.”45 At this vanishing point of  (future) science, the boundary to poetry in its highest form – the vision- ary yet reflected use of the reproductive, productive, and circumspective  imagination in the creation of a living simile – collapses. The sciences’ as  much as poetry’s ultimate goal is to withdraw the distinction between fact  and fiction, that is, as Langton states, to create another “example” of life  in a different medium, which eventually asserts its right to live just as any  life that unfolds in the material and historical world. The latter part of this  sentence actually paraphrases a letter from Goethe to his friend K.F. von  Reinhard that accompanied the sending of a copy of his newest brainchild,  which presents a wonderful opportunity to close also this investigation of  the wunderliche similarities among elective affinities (as elementary/imag- inary forces), “elective affinities” (as metaphor) and The Elective Affinities  (as a poetic simile in the form of the novel): When despite all criticism the content of this small book stands before the  imagination as an immutable factum [unveränderliches  Factum], when the  readers realize that all their willpower and aversion will not alter it; then they  will eventually accept an apprehensive Wunderkind in fiction [in der Fabel]  just as they have come to accept in history, after a few years, the execution  of an old king and the crowning of a new emperor. Poetic events assert their  rights just as historical events do.

Hoffmann’s novella Die Bergwerke zu Falun.  4 I should emphasize that my ambition in this essay is not to deliver a full- fledged interpretation of Goethe’s perhaps most interpreted work. (For  </page> <page sequence="27"> Elective Affinities / Wahlverwandtschaften 123 a lucid review of the novel’s scholarly reception until 2001 see Tantillo,  Goethe’s “Elective Affinities.”) I only relate to the Wahlverwandtschaften as  the most important literary document to reflect on the metaphoric relation  between the scientific and the poetic imagination, which, I argue, the novel  itself does in poetic terms.   5 Since the original wording of this short “note” matters, I add the German  text: “Es scheint, daß den Verfasser seine fortgesetzten physikalischen Arbe- iten zu diesem seltsamen Titel veranlaßten. Er mochte bemerkt haben, daß  man in der Naturlehre sich sehr oft ethischer Gleichnisse bedient, um etwas  von dem Kreise menschlichen Wissens weit Entferntes näher heranzubrin- gen; und so hat er auch wohl in einem sittlichen Falle, eine chemische Glei- chnisrede zu ihrem geistigen Ursprunge zurückführen mögen, um so mehr,  als doch überall nur eine Natur ist und auch durch das Reich der heitern  Vernunft-Freiheit die Spuren trüber, leidenschaftlicher Notwendigkeit sich  unaufhaltsam hindurchziehen, die nur durch eine höhere Hand, und vielleicht  auch nicht in diesem Leben, völlig auszulöschen sind.” Unless indicated oth- erwise, all translations of German sources are my own.  6 Goethe expressed this belief most prominently in the famous verses which  he adapted from Plotinus and which form, appropriately, a simile: “Wär’  nicht das Auge sonnenhaft, / Wie könnten wir das Licht erblicken? /  Lebt’ nicht in uns des Gottes eigne Kraft, / Wie könnt’ uns Göttliches  entzücken?” (FA 1.23/1:24) – “Something like the sun the eye must be, /  Else it no glint of sun could ever see; / Surely God’s own powers with us  unite, / Else godly things would not compel delight” (trans. Christopher  Middleton, GCW 1: 179).  7 I am elaborating on Goethe’s typology with reference to Kantian terminology  given that Goethe himself employed it here and at other occasions. Cf. esp.  the essays “Glückliches Ereignis,” “Einwirkung der neueren Philosophie,”  and “Anschauende Urteilskraft” in the first volume of his Hefte zur Mor- phologie (FA 1.24: 434–8, 442–8).  8 Fritz Breithaupt (Jenseits der Bilder, 131–88) describes the substitutive struc- ture of the image/picture and its working in the Wahlverwandtschaften in  his interpretation of the novel. Relevant for the poetics of the simile is his  observation that “no comparison” exists that could make visible the destruc- tions caused by the image, “since according to the program of substitution  reality does only appear as a substitute” (134–5), that is, reality can be only  conceived in the mode of representation. The simile, however, juxtaposes and  compares two different modes and layers of representations so that one may  serve as the critique of the other.  9 Cf. Robert Stockhammer’s entry “Gleichnis” in the Goethe-Handbuch 4.1: 388. </page> <page sequence="28"> 124 Christian P. Weber  10 In a letter to Jacobi (23 November 1801, HA Briefe 2: 423), Goethe expresses  this expectation from philosophy, which he only considers beneficent “when  she unifies, that is to say, when she increases, secures and transforms our gen- uine sense as if we were one with nature into a deep and quiet contemplation  [Anschauen] of the eternal unifying [συγχρισις] and separating [δίαχρισις], in  which we feel divine life.”   11 Goethe appreciates oriental poets especially for their similes, which he regards  as felicitous expressions of their cultural identity. He describes the ideal, i.e.,  quasi “natural,” creation process of some exemplary similes in his notes to the  “West-östlichen Divan,” cf. FA 1.3/1: 196–200.  12 All direct quotes from the Wahlverwandtschaften are cited by providing first  the chapter number of the novel (here: 1.4) followed by the page number of  the English edition of Elective Affinities in Judith Ryan’s translation (GCW  11, 89–262, here: 118). I have also used the German edition edited by Wal- traud Wiethölter (FA 1.8: 269–529).  13 Actually, the narrator reverses the relationship between master Eduard and  his serving gardener in this very first paragraph, since it is indeed the gardener  who feels “enjoyed” (the German ergetzte is reminiscent of God’s satisfied  contemplation of His Creation) about the “participating diligence of the lord.”  14 My analysis has been informed by Breithaupt’s precise close reading of the  first chapter, cf. 131–3.  15 I refer here to five texts that the Frankfurter edition compiled under the head- ing “Granit, Gebirgsbau und Epochen der Gesteinsbildung 1784–1785”   (FA 1.25: 311–21). For a thorough survey of Goethe’s interest in geology, see  von Engelhardt, Goethe im Gespräch mit der Erde.  16 Goethe translates his ethos of “obstinate realism” into a scientific method  of observation and experimentation in the essay Der Versuch als Vermittler  zwischen Objekt und Subjekt (FA 1.25: 26–36).  17 What Goethe considered fundamental and imperturbable knowledge at his  time is, as matter of fact, no longer accepted in most of the present geological  theories and models of earth formation.  18 My translation follows Douglas Miller’s (GCW 12: 132). I add here the first  part of the original German text to emphasize (by putting in italics) the char- acter of the simile that is lost in the translation: “In diesem Augenblicke da  die innern anziehenden und bewegenden Kräfte der Erde gleichsam unmittel- bar auf mich wirken, da die Einflüsse des Himmels mich näher umschweben,  werde ich zu höheren Betrachtungen der Natur hinauf gestimmt, und wie der  Menschengeist alles belebt so wird auch ein Gleichnis in mir rege dessen Erha- benheit ich nicht widerstehen kann. So einsam sage ich zu mir selber indem  ich diesen ganz nackten Gipfel hinab sehe und kaum in der Ferne am Fuße ein  geringwachsendes Moos erblicke, so einsam sage ich wird es dem Menschen  </page> <page sequence="29"> Elective Affinities / Wahlverwandtschaften 125 zu Mute der nur den ältsten ersten tiefsten Gefühlen der Wahrheit seine Seele  eröffnen will.”  19 I cannot go in detail here, but Goethe’s basic idea of world history was  influenced by Plato’s and Spinoza’s philosophy and, more specifically, by  Hamann’s ideas about the loss of unity in God’s Creation and the origi- nal poetic language through human reason, as expressed in his writings  Sokratische Denkwürdigkeiten and Aesthetica in nuce.  20 See his correspondence with Eckermann, 6 May 1827 (FA 1.8: 984).  21 See Goethe to Riemer, 24 July 1809: “The ethical symbols in the natural sci- ences (for example, that of elective affinities which was invented and used  by the great Bergman) are wittier and more readily connectable with poetry  and even society [Sozietät] than all others, though the latter, too, are merely  anthropomorphic, even the mathematical ones” (FA 1.8: 979–80).  22 First published in Latin in 1775 and quoted here after its English transla- tion by Thomas Beddoes as rendered by Mi Gyung Kim, 264–6. Cf. also  the recapitulations of Bergman’s Dissertatio in Jeremy Adler, “Eine fast  magische Anziehungskraft” 63–73 and Nils Reschke, “Zeit der Umwend- ung” 121–45.  23 Here quoted after the English translation Researches into the Laws of Chemi- cal Affinity from 1809 with page numbers in brackets, cf. Kim 411–33.  24 On how the introduction of quantities changed the conception of “elective  affinities” in the chemical discourse and on how this translates into Goethe’s  novel, cf. Hoffmann, “‘Zeitalter der Revolutionen.’”  25 Richards (Romantic Conception 252–88) provides an instructive recapitula- tion of Reil’s theories of life and mind.  26 The irony here is, of course, that he simply replaces one metaphor with  another, because the other was scientifically more established. Nowadays,  “elective affinity” sounds as mystical as “life force,” but so will probably a  metaphor like “genetic engineering” in a couple hundred years.  27 Cf. the definition in Lavoisier, Elements of Chemistry 3.  28 Today, we identify this “fine basic matter” as DNA.  29 The narrator reveals the psychology of displacements, which Eduard and  Charlotte are entangled in, as a systematic problem of modernity by using  the multivalent term “versetzen” (which means, among many other possible  things, “to displace,” but is here primarily used in the sense of “to counter  an argument”) in the novel’s first chapter no less than seventeen times, thus  setting the thematic leitmotif. According to Martina Schwanke, it is the most  frequently used word in the whole novel.  30 The content of this section is discussed in greater detail in my article “Particu- lar Universals – Universal Particulars: Biopolitical Metaphors and the Emer- gence of Nationalism in Europe (1650–1815).”  </page> <page sequence="30"> 126 Christian P. Weber  31 In his recent interpretation of Goethe’s Wahlverwandtschaften, Nils Reschke  argues that Goethe’s novel reflects the events of the French Revolution by  assuming the same critical position that Burke expressed in the Reflections (cf.  esp. chap. 3, “Wahlverwandtschaften: Goethe – Burke,” 85–119). This atti- tude is prominently articulated by the ironic opening sentence of the novel,  in which Eduard is introduced while “grafting freshly cut shoots onto young  rootstocks” (1.1; 93). He is thus completely inverting the practice of graft- ing as recommended by Burke – we learn later that Eduard, in doing so, acts  against the horticultural practice of his father – and is thus characterized as a  revolutionary.  32 See Schwartz for a thorough “historical contextualization” (After Jena 39) of  the novel.  33 Cf. Reschke 124–5.  34 Cf. Pörksen, “Goethes Kritik.”  35 Besides its criticism of “metaphoric symbolism,” there are two more aspects  of this letter that make me think that it contains the nucleus of the plan for  the future novel. First, Goethe articulates his shock about the suicide of Karo- line von Günderode, whose life and fate show some striking parallels with  the tragic figure of Ottilie. Second, he speaks about the “fate of the German  fatherland” during the Napoleonic occupation and how this political event is  reflected in the writings of certain nationalist authors, namely, Müller, Gentz  (Burke’s translator), and Arndt.  36 This passage is also discussed by Pörksen, 297–8, who reads “metaphorischen”  instead of “metaphysischen,” which is probably the correct rendering.  37 “Wunderlich,” like “Gleichnis,” is a favourite term of Goethe during these  years of the Napoleonic Wars and frequently appears in his letters between  1805 and 1810. It is difficult to translate and can mean all of the following:  wondrous, strange, curious, fantastic, and whimsical. Moreover, it is related  to marvellous (sich wundern = to marvel) and miraculous (das Wunder =  miracle) and even evokes an association with wounded (die Wunde = wound);  all of these meanings resonate in Goethe’s use of the word in the novel.  38 Cf. the detailed analysis of the “Gleichnisrede” and how it can be translated  into chemical formulas in Adler 84–139. Attempts to read the poetics of the  Wahlverwandtschaften exclusively in terms of these chemical formulas, how- ever, must fail in light of Goethe’s criticism and warning of unsubstantiated/ unmotivated transferences in the letter to Humboldt.  39 Cf. Müller-Sievers, Self-Generation 162.  40 For example Achim von Arnim, who saw in it “a segment of vanishing his- tory portrayed for the future in exact and exhaustive detail.” Letter to Bettina  Brentano, 5 November 1809, as cited in Schwartz, 15). </page> <page sequence="31"> Elective Affinities / Wahlverwandtschaften 127  41 Goethe to Kaspar von Sternberg, 19 September 1826, quoted from   Reschke, 136.  42 See Goethe’s Dichtung und Wahrheit: “True poetry announces itself [to us],  as a secular Gospel, by freeing us through inner cheerfulness and external  comfort from the earthly burdens that press on us. Like a balloon, it lifts us  and all the ballast attached to us to higher regions and lets us see, from a   bird’s perspective, the confused paths of the world spread before us”   (FA 1.15: 631).   43 See his essay Der Versuch als Vermittler von Objekt und Subjekt: “The true  botanist shall be neither touched by the beauty nor by the usability of plants.  He shall just study their forms and relations among each other. As they are all  raised and shined on by the sun, the botanist shall look at them all and survey  them in the same calm manner” (FA 1.25: 26).  44 See Goethe to Johann F. Cotta, 26 July 1808: “The novel is a generally com- prehensible [faßliches] and, also for the writer, a comfortably entertaining  genre; I feel a great urge to put more of what I have to say into this form than  previously” (FA 1.8: 978). Cf. his statement to Eckermann, 5 May 1827, FA  1.8: 984.  45 Quoted in Fox Keller, 267.
