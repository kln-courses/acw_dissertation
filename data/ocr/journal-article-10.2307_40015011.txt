<plain_text><page sequence="1">A RESPONSE TO CRITICS James M. Gustafson* The authors of the four articles and the letter published in the previous number of JRE have been far more than casual friends of mine over the years; perhaps it is only friends who would lavish so much attention on my work. I am grateful for that attention and cannot, within the proper length of an article, fully respond to many of the details of their criticism. In 1981, I delivered the Ryerson Lecture at the University of Chicago, a lectureship which requires that a scholar present his or her work to an au- dience drawn from the entire university community. In that lecture, "Say Some- thing Theological!", I stated the four major foci or themes of my work; it comes as close to a compact statement of my self-understanding, fully stated in Ethics from a Theocentric Perspective, as I have produced. I shall quote the lead sentences from each part of the lecture as a backdrop against which I can address my interpreters and critics. "To say something theological is to say something religious. Theology has its deepest significance within the context of piety, and in the context of a historic religious tradition." "To say something theological is to say something about how things really and ultimately are." "To say something theological is to say something ethical." My work takes each of these with equal seriousness, and is constructed to show the interrelationships between them. The two volumes of Ethics are amplifications and developments of these themes and their interrelations. All five of my critics fail satisfactorily to grasp how the four themes of piety, tradition, how things really are, and ethics interpenetrate in my work. Toulmin understands quite well how the last two are interrelated, but (per- haps for professional reasons) does not disclose the relations between piety and tradition to them. Hauerwas is quoted in a brochure as writing that my "critique of the anthropocentrism of Christian theology is a challenge so serious and well developed I do not think it will be possible for anyone to continue to do theology, and in particular theological ethics, in a 'business as usual' manner." I judge all my theological critics to want to do theological business as usual. They want nothing from other ways of construing the world to affect their theologies; indeed, I infer that they find that quite threatening. And none of them, as I shall develop below, does justice to the ways in which piety and tradition interpenetrate with my use of materials from the sciences. Nor are they very willing to be open to the possibility that some contempo- 185</page><page sequence="2">186 The Journal of Religious Ethics rary interpretations of how things ultimately are require some change in ethics. None of them is alert to the way in which I hold together our being and our doing in life, and thus the ways in which religious sensibilities evoked by the power and powers of God penetrate our modes of response to the world re- ligiously, intellectually, and morally. I shall not further develop the modes of interpenetration here; a careful reading of the Ethics makes them clear to perceptive readers. Toulmin comes closest to grasping the fundamental character of the vision I have articulated. I see the two volumes as a "whole" the parts of which are interrelated; I see it as being "organic" in its configuration. Alterations in one theme necessar- ily require alterations in the others. None of my critics faults the overall co- herence of my Ethics, but at least my four theological critics basically ignore it, and Toulmin omits discussion of piety and tradition. My response is divided into three parts: (1) themes they have ignored or in- adequately taken into account in their interpretations of my work; (2) themes which they have misconstrued; and (3) remarks on each author separately. /. MISSING THEMES Apart from Toulmin, none of the authors takes into account my interpre- tation of the cultural and historical circumstances which I clearly indicate I am addressing. At least three of them take into account the interpretation of what I call utilitarian religion and seem to agree that there is some point to that. But what is left out is important. I am concerned about the effects of modern self-proclaimed human autonomy in relation to the natural world and potential dangers of this (as well as its benefits). The need to recognize human finitude or limitations in individuals, human communities, and in- stitutions and in the species is a part of my argument throughout (see 1981:3-16). The failure to take into account what is for me a much deeper and longer range problem misses one of the marks of my recent work. What I write makes limited sense without taking seriously my arguments for a radi- cal sense of dependence and interdependence not only in nature, but in his- tory, society, and culture, and for the ways in which man participates in those patterns and processes of interdependence. Put differently, there is a theo- logical and moral judgment in my work on the presumption of self-sufficiency that abounds in many places, and thus on the denial of God as the one whose ordering of life cannot be ignored or denied without courting perilous conse- quences. To me, this human presumption raises more serious religious and moral or theological and ethical issues than those addressed by my moral theological colleagues. In this respect I share some measure the interpreta- tion of modern life developed by Hans Jonas in The Imperative of Responsi- bility (1984), a book I hope other theologians and ethicians will respond to.</page><page sequence="3">A Response to Critics 187 To my critics: if I am incorrect in this, please show me the evidence. If I am correct, how do your various moral theologies address the issues? Do your theologies provide an ethical base that includes them? Can they be addressed without reliance on arguments from authority - biblical or theological - as your four papers very much do? I am also concerned with the impact of many alternative ways of constru- ing life in the world, i.e., to use a word I normally avoid, pluralism. There is a practical theological interest in my work; indeed, I state clearly that the- ology is a practical discipline. That practical interest is, in my view, a matter to be taken seriously by the churches. Neither clergy nor laity, at least among those with average education and above, is exempt from being affected by many different non-theological interpretations of life. Even if they do not watch "Nova" on public television, they are impacted by fictionalized ver- sions of scientific interpretations on other television programs. The readers of the newsweeklies and daily newspapers know something about these alter- natives. In addition, since childhood I have been impressed with different religious interpretations, and to have been stationed among Shans and Ka- chins, Khasis and Nagas, Assamese and Bengalis, Hindus and Muslims and Jains was enough to make me conscious of more radical religious pluralism than I knew in Norway, Michigan. A two-month return trip to India in 1978 and to other parts of Asia did not diminish my sense of the importance of these matters. My concern in this respect is for the intellectual and moral life of the Chris- tian community, its credibility, and its capacities to deal with alternative con- struals of life without retreating into intellectual and moral sectarianism. In- deed, in the face of these matters I was bold to say that I was more concerned for the truth claims, or at least the plausibility claims, of theology than with a defense of the Christian tradition. Among my critics only Toulmin, per- haps because his identity is not marked by membership in the Christian church, recognizes the importance of this aspect of my work. A second theme that is quite missing is the interpretation of man that is essential to everything else in both volumes. Curiously, none of my critics thinks that the chapter "Man in Relation to God and the World," or the de- scription of human experience that is given earlier, is important at many points for my argument. To be sure, some make general reference to my use of "ex- perience" but as an abstraction and not a dense description. My arguments about man support the overcoming of dichotomies that are present in much of contemporary theology and particularly ethics: between religion and mo- rality; reason and af fectivity (an Edwardsian view that Ramsey does not take into account in his own work); the is and the ought or fact and value; human nature and human history, etc. I shall not embellish this, but simply call at- tention to the sections "Natural Man" (1981:281-93) and "Convictions: The Priority of Human Experience" (1981: 115-29). In the latter reference I re-</page><page sequence="4">188 The Journal of Religious Ethics quest that they attend to the details and not simply the title. My account of "natural man" is defended, and what I say about a number of other things is not only coherent with it, but also is a necessary condition for understand- ing what I say, e.g., about the process of discernment; in the moves I make to explicate what I think is theologically defensible; and other places. None of the authors attends to my discussion of "The 'Human Fault'" (1981: 219-306). That has to be taken into account in order to understand my interpretation of other things I address. The moral fault is a deep religious fault; the deep religious fault has serious implications for our moral percep- tions and actions. The afflictions of life that must be addressed practically are not only due to finitude, but to the human fault, the contraction of the soul, of vision, of rationality. I believe that my interpretation of the human condition necessitates a deeper and more radical conversion than is implied in any of the critical responses; perhaps Toulmin, in nonreligious language, understands this better than critics who cite biblical and other theological sources. Thus I request that my critics attend to "The Correction" (1981:307-17). The correction requires not merely that one avoid becoming a "rule-utilitarian non-agapist" or any other jargonized position; it requires more than an or- thodox set of Christian beliefs (a la McCormick and Cahill), and more than identifying ourselves with Jesus and the church (Hauerwas) as our point of historical identity. It requires a more radical conversion than any of my theo- logical critics. It demands an alteration and enlargement of vision, a reorder- ing of the heart, and different standards for determining our human being and doing (1981: 308). It demands what the tradition calls repentence and sal- vation. I am, more radically than my critics, a conversionist in religion and morals. I believe that my work cannot be understood fairly without taking into account my interpretation of man and that serious misunderstandings result from not doing so. Any criticism, therefore, that does not demonstrate my errors in this regard is not cogent, and any profile that omits the anthropol- ogy necessarily distorts other aspects of my work. B. A. Gerrish has an article, "Theology Within the Limits of Piety Alone: Schleiermacher and Calvin's Doctrine of God" (Gerrish, 1981). I cite the title to indicate a third and very fundamental theme which is not carefully ad- dressed by my critics: the nature and significance of piety. I state very clearly over and over that the entire theological and ethical enterprise in which I am engaged makes sense only in the context of piety. Cahill, for example, does not note this in her criticisms of the ways in which I use materials from the sciences (please see 1981:257, 1981: 196, and elsewhere). Insofar as the charge of "scientism" (McCormick) implies a kind of rationalistic objectivism, it is grossly inaccurate. Insofar as the language of piety suggests to some an un- critical subjectivism, it is equally inaccurate.</page><page sequence="5">A Response to Critics 189 Outside of piety, I cannot argue that the patterns and processes of inter- dependence are indications of God's ordering of the world; I cannot argue that the moral enterprise requires that we seek to discern the relations of all things to God (which is more complex than the application of moral rules). Outside of piety, I cannot argue for overcoming the dichotomies of reason and revelation, of morality and religion, and others which distort our capaci- ties to comprehend properly both life in the world and our relations to God. I also argue for the use of the term piety rather than faith in order to over- come the dichotomy between faith and reason - a dichotomy which I infer is uncritically accepted by each of my theological critics. In short, outside of piety, the human relation to God evoked by the indications of the divine ordering in nature, history, and society and their interpretation in the Bible, I cannot, as Augustine, Calvin, and Edwards could not, say anything theo- logical. A fourth theme that certainly does not get serious attention by any of my theological critics, but is central to Toulmin's essay, is my statement that man is a participant in the patterns and processes of interdependence of life in the world. I hope I need not remind readers that I have argued that these patterns and processes are, in a strong sense, indications of the divine pow- ers. The absence of attention to this in McCormick's essay I find surprising. I would have thought that my use of this description would resonate with traditional Roman Catholic theology and with natural law as a basis for mo- rality. It seems to me that what Thomas Aquinas did was similar to what I have done, namely to use a contemporary understanding of the relations of things to each other in nature, society, and culture as indications of how God is related to and is ordering the world and thus the ground of morality. McCormick's response to me is curiously Protestant and biblical; how the theology he portrays is related to the ethics he so carefully develops through his writings I cannot understand, unless we assume a sharp dichotomy be- tween revelation and reason or faith and reason. Ramsey is correct to say that there are relational elements to his ethics, but his are more covenantal than mine. Nature seems to be dropped out of Ramsey's position; covenanted relations seem to be the only ones that count theologically and morally. He radically separates nature and history. He is willing to carry the distinction to what I find to be a logical but amusing, if not ridiculous, extreme when he justifies monogamy in Christendom on the basis of God's covenant with one people, Israel (many of whom had more than one wife after the covenant, if the biblical accounts are accurate) and Christ's covenant with one church. There, and not in nature, is where Ramsey sees the mind of God revealed about the order of marriage. Ramsey turns out to be more of a Barthian and biblicist than I thought. In contrast with Ramsey on this and other points, my descriptive statement enlarges the range of matters that are morally significant, provides a basis for addressing them</page><page sequence="6">190 The Journal of Religious Ethics which (on its descriptive premises about human participation) is generally accessible to Christians, atheists, and others in our pluralistic world (though that effect is not the motive for my arguing for the description). It also ac- counts for why I have to take into account outcomes of human action over a broader space and time than Ramsey does. On the basis of my theology, these outcomes necessarily are morally of great significance. I do not blush in shame for having consequentialist as well as deontic aspects of my ethics. The theology necessitates both. To undercut my position, Ramsey has to ar- gue that this descriptive statement is incorrect; because he does not, appar- ently, perceive its significance for my project, his argument against me is not against the fundamental grounds of my work. Is God, for Ramsey, only im- portant within the context of covenants? What is the theological and moral significance of natural interdependencies for Ramsey? Clearly my relational- ism is not confined to the sphere of personal relations as Ramsey's is. Cahill worries about my use of the sciences, and thus about an immanent- ism in my interpretation of how God is present in the world. McCormick, perhaps, has the opposite worry - that God is excessively transcendent for me. The divine powers are immanent in the ordering of life not only in na- ture, but in society and culture as well. The question for Cahill is this: can she develop theological ethics without inserting something like my descrip- tion between her transcendent Deity and life in the world? Since Cahill is so taken by my anecdotes from my family, I offer her an- other. At the time of this writing, my mother, age 94, in her third month of unconsciousness is sustained by a human invention called Ensure which goes from an electrically operated pump which holds a bag of that product and controls its flow to her stomach through a flexible tube passing through her nose. A catheter drains her urine, and attendants faithfully clean up her feces. My mother has become a biological organism that (not who) metabo- lizes Ensure into feces and urine and into sufficient energy to continue to metabolize Ensure into feces and urine. Her pastor prayed with my siblings and me, begging God to take our mother's life. When we returned to my mother's room, I pointed to the technology and said to my siblings, "God didn't put that damned thing up there and God can't take the damned thing down." How, pray tell, is God to take my mother's life if not through the ordering of nature? (In re: my casuistical colleagues, I interpret the issues in my mother's treatment not merely in medical casuistic terms [which I use to argue with her physician] but also in more radical religious terms: idolatry and failure to accept finitude. For an account of the former, read Luther on the First Commandment in the Larger Catechism.) Toulmin not only refers to my description of humans as interdependent and participants, but seems in general to approve of it. I take the critical point of his essay to be that I have not demonstrated how we can come to certi- tude about morality based upon these patterns and processes of interdepen-</page><page sequence="7">A Response to Critics 191 dence. If I am correct, there is a Cartesian trace I would not expect to find in Toulmin. I have explained as thoroughly as I can at the present time both how we can seek certitude and why complete certainty is beyond our grasp, including the significance of development or change. But I find it ironic for Toulmin to be making that critical point against me, since I have been in- formed by much of his own philosophical work in developing my arguments about the limits of certitude. Of course, Hauerwas's position simply rules out any concern for my de- scriptive statement. History (in a variety of senses, none of which are very clearly distinguished) is so exclusively the locus of whatever he wants to de- fend that we have a curious theology. To differentiate himself from me he writes: "I remain stuck with the claim that through Jesus' resurrection God decisively changed our history." (I don't know who is included and excluded from the "our.") "Therefore I believe we must continue to begin with the 'par- ticular,' with the historical, not because there is no other place to begin but because that is where God begins." I say, harshly, that I find that sentence, even in context, to be ludicrous. I can only infer that nature is of no theo- logical significance, and that God was absent, or something, until Jesus's res- urrection. God is not sovereign over nature, I take it. Nature is also, then, of no ethical significance as a source of direction in Hauerwas's ethics. Hauer- was becomes a twentieth-century version of Marcion. Before leaving this fourth theme, I wish to relate it to previous ones that my critics seem not to take seriously. The descriptive statement not only pro- vides a cognitive basis for ethics to be defended only on rational grounds; it is an articulation of the experience of dependence and interdependence and the ambiguities of our capacity to be self-determining participants; it is a description of our being and not only a basis for our doing. In piety we find God inexorably present in these processes and patterns, and our participa- tion in them is the locus of our fidelity and service to God. //. MISCONSTRUED THEMES The spheres of missing and underrated themes and that of misconstrued themes necessarily overlap. To write about the latter will, unfortunately, re- quire some repetition of the former. Recall the themes of my Ryerson Lecture. The theological enterprise is a religious enterprise in two dimensions. First, it exists within the context of piety; I have already indicated that my critics omit this theme. Second, it develops in the context of a historic religious tra- dition, unless it is a rationalistic theology or what is traditionally called "natu- ral" theology. Of the theologians on whose work I comment in volume one, Ralph Burhoe comes closest to trying to develop a theology without signifi- cant reference to a particular religious tradition. On the context of piety and</page><page sequence="8">192 The Journal of Religious Ethics tradition, I believe some of my critics have both ignored and misconstrued what I have said; others disagree with how I have incorporated and differen- tiated myself from traditions. All of them have failed to grasp the mutual informing of piety and tradition. Second, as McCormick accurately quotes me, theology seeks to say some- thing about how things really and ultimately are. It is on the basis of this conviction (and it is argued for, not merely asserted) that I am theologically constrained to take more seriously than any of my critics, save Toulmin, some other disciplines that help us to understand how things really and ultimately are. This does not, however, relinquish the theological task to the scientist since, per definition, theology is reflection on the object of piety as piety is evoked by the powers that bear down upon us and sustain us. Third, theology implies ethics; perhaps it even "entails" ethics. The ethical task is to discern what God is enabling and requiring us to be and to do. Only Ramsey has charged me with incoherence between what I say theologi- cally and the ethics that follow from it; if I understand his critical argument I am not convinced by it. McCormick, in his addendum on special ethics, argues that one can come to the same conclusions (in the cases he cited) from ethics from an anthropocentric perspective as I do from a theocentric per- spective. That, of course, does not surprise me because I never argued you could not and, as I shall illustrate later, I can suggest to McCormick some instances in which one's final judgment would be - and is - different. I am misconstrued by my critics on the significance of piety and tradition in moving from experience and some aspects of science to what I affirm about the reality of God. Of course, insofar as my critics argue from authority- biblical or traditional theological- there is a significant difference between us, one which I have candidly stated and defended in my writings. Both Cahill and McCormick, and Outka behind Cahill (see CahilPs note 5), do not state adequately the way in which I work from piety and the Chris- tian theological tradition, and how I work within that tradition to interpret elements drawn from other sources. I have already adverted to the "scientism" charge; McCormick says I come "close" to it, and it is implied by Cahill and certainly by Outka's article. These critics seem to assume that I am trying to argue on purely cognitive (and not also affective) grounds, and that I am trying to argue rationalistically or nonhistorically, i.e., without reference to the Reformed tradition of Christianity. I can only beg, plead, cajole them to read with great care the argument of volume one and particularly chapter five, and more particularly pages 251-79. For example, after I have argued for what sciences can contribute to our understanding of God, I say that I believe those contributions can sustain a general point, namely that "'God' refers to the power that bears down upon us, sustains us, sets an ordering of relationships, provides the conditions of possibilities for human activity, and even a sense of direction. The evidences from various sciences suggest</page><page sequence="9">A Response to Critics 193 the plausibility of viewing God in these terms. These terms, and any warrants for them from the sciences, however, find their full religious significance only within piety, religious affectivity" (1981:264). (I suppose if I had said only within "faith" it would not seem so offensive, but see my argument for the choice of piety rather than faith.) In an earlier section of chapter five I show how traditional symbols - God as Creator, etc.- continue to be viable ways of speaking about God in rela- tion to man and the world. These symbols do not come out of Buddhism, or Hinduism, or Teutonic religion, though there may be functional equiva- lents to some of them in other religions. On pages 163-78 I give my reasons for preference for the Reformed tradition; true, I do not argue from its au- thority and am selective in relation to it, as I am sure my theological critics would have to admit that they are selective from their traditions, or more generally, the tradition. That Reformed tradition is of no mean significance in construing ethics from a theocentric perspective. Thus to interpret me as if I wished to move from evidences from science to an account of God on some presumptively purely nonhistorical, rational, cognitive basis without tak- ing into the argument piety and tradition is simply wrong. As I said above, I do not think that my basic move in drawing from the sciences (see McCor- mick, "The Book of Nature") is essentially different from that of Thomas Aquinas or Schleiermacher or others. I also made it clear at several points that God remains mystery beyond our best efforts to say what we can honestly say about God. Great theolo- gians, not merely Gustafson, have said that: an author of Genesis, the author of the Books of Samuel, Augustine, Thomas, Bonaventure, Luther, Calvin, Edwards, Schleiermacher, Barth, and many more. McCormick simply has a deaf ear if he cannot hear that in what I have written, and thus thinks I ex- clude all "mysticism." To find out how things really and ultimately are, one has to read not only theology but also science. But the way things are, to the eyes of piety, has theological significance; it is an indication of God's ordering of the world. Cahill, Outka before her, and others appeal directly or implicitly to the limita- tions of scientific knowledge as those have been argued by recent historians and philosophers of science. I have read a great deal of that literature, and surely nothing in how I use evidences from science is based on a simple-minded Machian positivism. An excursus is in order at this point. I find many theologians, who use Kuhn (and so many have read only him; cf. Kuhn, 1970) et al. to show that science is "softer" than is reputed, to be self-serving in the end. That is, if science is soft, there are warrants for theology being soft. And if science is soft, what we learn from it need not be taken seriously when we try to con- strue the world theologically, i.e., how things really and ultimately are. Or, another move is that the two realms of discourse are so different that they</page><page sequence="10">194 The Journal of Religious Ethics are incommensurable. Cahill comes close to affirming this when she writes that "the unresolved question is whether either or both have a distinctive lan- guage which addresses realities not comprehensive within the other's world- view." My criticism of Paul Holmer and others shows my response to that. But theologians do take recourse to scientific work, selectively; when it serves their interests, they use it and when it threatens them, they do not. I remind my readers that the fundamentalist creationists have also read their philoso- phy of science, and thus argue that the evolutionary accounts of nature are no more credible or incredible than the biblical account of creation as a sci- entific explanation. But most contemporary theologians are willing to accept the biblical account as mythic in part because they know there is a more de- fensible scientific account of how things have come to be. Maybe, then, they ought to ask themselves about other scientifically backed views, e.g., about the finis of things, and whether traditional eschatology can be held in the light of that. Further, I have great respect for what can be known from the "soft" his- torical tradition and social framework of science. It is not so soft but what, e.g., a geneticist can determine precisely which chromosome is abnormal and thus the causal factor of a certain disease. That, I take it, is worthy of a lot of respect. And that has to be of theological significance if God is Creator and Orderer of nature. I beg, plead, cajole my critics to read carefully the following, which is a conclusion to my discussion of ways in which theologians have related their work to science. I indicate my affinity with Troeltsch's statement (1981:251) and my differences from it. "First, piety (rather than 'belief') is a necessary condition for ideas of God to be subjectively meaningful and intellectually persuasive. . . . Second, the 'substantial content' of ideas of God cannot be incongruous with (rather than must be 'in harmony with') well established data and explanatory principles established by relevant sciences, and must 'be in some way indicated by these'" (1981:257). Ryerson Lecture themes are never separated. Moreover, it is our ideas of God that must be informed by relevant sciences. The sciences provide critical tests of traditional theological and ethical concepts; the impulse to test arises out of piety and not out of subservience to the sciences. Of course, to Hauerwas the sciences are of no theological significance. We are somehow to begin with history or tradition and stay within them. His interpretation of my work goes back, as the other critics do not, to some things I wrote before 1979-1980. Hauerwas would be correct if what he is saying is the following: Gustafson has wrestled with social, cultural, and historical relativism all his career, and has rather consistently affirmed the inescapabil- ity of historical relativism. There have been changes in Gustafson's work, however, as he expands the criteria by which he tests, revises, and develops the historically relative base. But Hauerwas is saying something else. One has</page><page sequence="11">A Response to Critics 195 to be either a "historicist" or a "universalist." Somewhere on a continuum there is a gulf over which one has to pass; rather than a continuum to which ideas like universalism or relativism have graded relevance, one has to be one or the other. And if you are one or the other then that is what you work from and dismiss all considerations from the other. Otherwise you are incon- sistent. I, Hauerwas, begin with history and I stay with history. One cannot read the long quotation Hauerwas has from 1981: 151 accu- rately and come to his conclusion, "Yet, at times, Gustafson seems to sug- gest, in spite of his criticism of the philosophers, that it would be good if we could be so emancipated," that is, emancipated from the historical and cultural. The quotation says that to strive for the universal provides grounds for apologetic work, and for internal criticism and revision of the tradition. For Hauerwas, one has to be either a "particularism or a "univeralist." To move from the more particular in order to explain or criticize it is, appar- ently, already for him to have made a theological error. I think Hauerwas owes us clearer, more precise interpretations and defenses of a number of things for which he has become well known, but in this case for the following. I find history, particularism, and such words to run through his essay like a greased pig at the county fair contest. My mind thinks it grasps their meaning, but they slip away. These terms become abstractions that seem to me to have different referents at different places in the essay. Strangely, they point to little that is particular or historical except that God began with the particular, seemingly the resurrection of Jesus. If Hauerwas thinks he can establish a defense of radical historicism, par- ticularism, communalism, or what have you by making (for what are in one of his senses) only historical claims, he is mistaken. Subsequent to writing his essay on me I have seen two places in which he commends George Lind- beck's The Nature of Doctrine (1984). I read Lindbeck to be making some philosophical claims (universalistic?) about the nature of religious language and about the way one becomes religious or anything else - i.e., by learning to use a language. Certainly Troeltsch's and H. Richard Niebuhr's basis for being "historicists" is philosophically grounded. I do not see how one can make a claim for radical historicism on only historical claims. Further, Hauerwas does not begin only with particular ism; he begins with something particular. And to show us why he begins with that particular and not some other possible particular surely involves arguing in a way that calls on criteria and justifications that are more general (if not universal). Why not begin with the cross rather than the resurrection? Why not with the crea- tion? His criteria may be drawn from the Bible or the tradition, but he has to provide some kind of "non-particular" defenses for his choice. Otherwise he is left simply solipsistically confessing, and is likely to be quite unintelli- gible to others who want to start with a different particular. The same issues are raised by his statement that the church is the context</page><page sequence="12">196 The Journal of Religious Ethics in which he does ethics; it is an abstraction. I can argue that the church is the context in which I do ethics. What church is Hauerwas's context, since it is such a crucial context? I do not recognize the Russian Orthodox Church in what he writes, nor the Roman Catholic Church; it certainly does not seem to me to be the Church of England or the Church of Sweden. By what cri- teria can we identify his "church? " Can it be done without some general (if not universal) claims? Maybe to be a radical particularist or historicist you have to be vague in order to avoid more expanded intellectual justifications or defenses (universalism?) for what you say. If theology has to say something about how things really and ultimately are, Hauerwas's theology is very narrow and confined. In this respect he and Ramsey are similar. If I understand Ramsey (and it is predictable that he does not believe I do), the covenant , not nature, is the theological basis for ethics. So where is, even in traditional Christian terms, the doctrine of creation? Hauerwas seems to me to be even more extreme than Ramsey, though it is not precisely clear what his claims are. Since God begins in history, according to him, everything else we do in ethics has to be confined in some way to the historical or particular. So of Hauerwas one also asks, where is the doc- trine of creation? I wonder what McCormick and Cahill think about Hauerwas's position. They seem to think I do not take tradition, history, or piety into account and thus rely too heavily on science and experience. Would they prefer Hauer- was? Hauerwas seems to me to take what they think is wrong about my work to an extreme position: only Christian faith, history, and tradition are theo- logically important. Hauerwas's is an intellectual and moral sectarianism of the most extreme sort; thus he keeps a clear distinction between Christianity and the rest of life alive but forecloses apologetics of any kind and limits the range of the ethical. Hauerwas's God becomes the tribal God of a minority of the earth's population. I could argue cogently, I believe, that this is very unbiblical in many respects. My critics misconstrue what I say about Jesus Christ. Ramsey, McCor- mick, and Cahill are disturbed by what I do say; what I do not say disturbs them more. One difference between them and me is the authority of tradi- tion. I am quite certain that if the early church had found its cultural en- vironment in India of the first century of the common era, the philosophic explanations of the significance of Jesus would have been quite different than they became in the Hellenistic culture; Hinduism and Buddhism as context would have led to a different history of Christianity both in theology and ethics. Developments which, to me, can be explained as historically acciden- tal are to them theologically determinative. I do not deny that there is value to the tradition of the West; indeed, clearly I affirm that the Reformed tradi- tion perceived things in ways I think are of continuing validity. It is clear from the New Testament itself that Jewish Christianity was different from Pauline Christianity. But my arguments are not exegetical.</page><page sequence="13">A Response to Critics 197 I do not make an exegetical argument for the statement on 1981:276, as it seems that McCormick and Ramsey think I do. Cahill writes, "he down- plays the role of Jesus, identified as an incarnation of theistic piety, and does not attribute to him ultimate status." I do not use "an," though it can be read in that way. I wrote, "Jesus incarnates theocentric piety and fidelity [please note, theocentric and not theistic, and note fidelity, Ramsey also misquotes this statement]. Through the gospel account of his life and ministry, we can see and know something of the powers that bear down upon us and sustain us, and of the piety and manner of life that are appropriate to them." No- body seems to note the second sentence. I suppose if I had written, instead, "through the gospel accounts of his life and ministry God reveals something of the powers that bear down upon us and sustain and redeem us, and of the faith and life that is appropriate to them," it might have passed for or- thodoxy, or at least avoided the charge of heresy that McCormick implies. But even if I chose to say that, which I cannot ("God reveals" being ruled out by me), I will never attribute to Jesus "ultimate status." Ultimate status, if I understand what Cahill wants that to refer to, is given only to God. If my theological critics claim that I have to adhere to the Chalcedonean for- mula to be a Christian, I do not agree. (Incidentally, I think a lot of contem- porary Roman Catholic and Protestant theology, including Hauerwas's, does not deny Chalcedon; it just ignores it and practically follows a Christology closer to what I state.) My theological critics do not develop my reasons for not saying "God re- veals," and thus either do not understand the claims and limits of claims I make, or simply assert some view of revelation. McCormick asks "why reflec- tion on human experience cannot be the vehicle of God's self-manifestation?" If he is willing to concede my description that what the Bible portrays is an interpretation of human experience, nature, history, culture, and self in the light of the communities' experience of the powers of God, the only issue is whether God made a choice to become manifest in those historical and natural events. If he concedes that, the distinction between revealed and natu- ral theology is qualified, if not collapsed. I say that through those experi- ences the people confronted the reality of God, and could say that through them they found God manifest. Indeed, I think what I say is not terribly dif- ferent from what my mentor, H. Richard Niebuhr, said in The Meaning of Revelation, but because he called it "revelation" (and meant it), it is not sub- ject to McCormick's charge, I suppose. The issue here is the use of personalistic language with reference to God. I discuss the significance of this for theological ethics in my section on Barth and Thomas. What is the proper language to use in construing God's rela- tion to the world? Theological language designates relations which are "reli- gious"; the term God refers to the powers that bring all things into being, sustain, and bear down upon us, etc. It is a linguistic construal. I avoid lan- guage like "God reveals himself" since it seems to suggest that the Deity, out-</page><page sequence="14">198 The Journal of Religious Ethics side of our human construal of God, acts like a person. Even persons, for me, must be understood internationally, and not as "autonomously" as my critics seem to hold. To speak of God in personal terms seems to suggest that we can speak of God in se. I seek to avoid anthropomorphism in speaking of God. Thus I avoid the use of personalistic language about God. I have attempted to be precise in my thinking on this matter and thus to use lan- guage precisely. "God reveals himself" introduces an ambiguity I seek to avoid. On this point it would have been worthwhile for my theological critics to have attended to my publications beginning with Treasure in Earthen Vessels and forward. Consistently my work has been motivated by a desire to force theologians to modify or correct exaggerated claims. Treasure was motivated by the writings on ecclesiology pouring forth in the 1950s, much of them under the auspices of the World Council of Churches Commission on Christ and the Church. To write about the church as a natural and political community, and as a community in which a historic tradition is maintained not by the "Spirit" but by social processes was offensive to some people when that book came out. The final chapter of Christ and the Moral Life is a very naturalistic proposal, as is what I say in Can Ethics be Christian*! To repeat, I have all through my career been concerned about exaggerated claims of theologians, especially when those claims (as they often are) are tacitly empirical ones. On this point, McCormick is an example of what I take to be exaggerated claims when he writes that faith "totally transforms the human person. It creates new operative vitalities that constitute the very possibility and heart of the Christian moral life." I take such an assertion to be testable, unless it is so tightly circular that it becomes tautological. It is very extravagant, more than Augustine, Thomas, Luther, Calvin, and even Schleiermacher claimed. And the limits of their claims were to a considerable extent drawn from observations that Christian people were not very transformed. Again, McCormick draws from Raymond Brown this point: "Jesus is the source of the Christians' love of one another." Jesus might well be a source, but my observation of Christians (and humbly, perhaps I might be included among them) is that their love for one another has a lot of sources, many of them very natural and shared by atheists, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, and animists, et al Even more egregious, and leaving me aghast, is McCormick's sentence, "Nothing is intelligible without reference to God's deed in Christ." That h an empirical claim. Perhaps since my beliefs are, according to McCormick not Christian, I have peculiar difficulties with it. But I think my scores of colleagues doing research on countless aspects of life and culture would be as surprised by it as I am. I really do not think McCormick believes what he said. (Both orally and in writing I have been commended for being honest and courageous in writing Ethics from a Theocentric Perspective. I find those commendations to be alarming. Am I to draw the inference that many theo-</page><page sequence="15">A Response to Critics 199 logians and pastors are not being honest and lack in fortitude? The commen- dations only reinforce a point made earlier in this essay, namely my deep con- cern about the quality of intellectual and moral life in the Christian community.) A further aspect of the theme of how things really and ultimately are is perhaps as much missed as misconstrued. I infer from all my theological crit- ics that they still operate within a radical distinction between the sacred and the profane, the religious and the secular, faith and reason and others similar to these. My work intentionally interprets the relations of God to the world in ways which make those distinctions inadequate if not obsolete. To para- phrase a statement of Bonhoeffer's, I never confront the reality of the world without confronting God, and I confront God through the reality of the world. It would not be inappropriate, except that it would invite misinterpretations, to say that the theology and ethics I have written are incarnational: God pres- ent in the world. If I confront God in the world, I confront God in natural and historical events that are both sustaining and destructive of the perceived good for human being. Cahill writes, as if it is somehow shocking, "Gustafson even refers to the powers that bear down as 'powers of destruction' and concludes that there is sometimes 'enmity toward' God. In this conception, the will of God seems to go beyond lack of favoritism toward humans, beyond indifference even, and approach malevolence." If, in the two volumes, I ever ascribed either benevolence or malevolence to God, I was not careful. The impersonality of the Deity, to whom I am personally related, prohibits me from using (unless I am inconsistent) " - volence" as a suffix with reference to God. It denotes a capacity for intentional agency on God's part which I do not affirm. I can be thankful to God for his benefits to the world, just as Heschel can; but if I can be thankful for his benefits, I can have enmity toward God for the suffering of the world on precisely the same principle. I cannot expect fami- lies suffering from starvation because human obstacles keep them from get- ting food that exists on the earth to thank God for all his benefits to them. Enmity toward God is not without ambiguity; it can be justified and a sign of failure to consent. Further, to recur to an earlier theme, because Cahill does not take seri- ously my dense description of religious affections she drops out altogether gratitude as one aspect of piety which moves humans to moral activity. Earlier she says that I appear "unconvinced that a religious perspective can endow suffering with either purposiveness or resolution." On purposiveness she is simply incorrect, unless that implies some grand metaphysical purpose. Suf- fering has many "purposes"; physical pain indicates the need for some atten- tion to its cause; social oppression indicates the need for social justice, and so forth. Cahill resolves the issue of suffering by turning to biblical material. She finds in the New Testament "that all crucifixion will be recompensed,"</page><page sequence="16">200 The Journal of Religious Ethics and "the claim that the Cross always is redemptive and divinely vindicated." For now I will grant that as a biblical claim, but I do not need to premise that biblical claim, curiously, to find little disagreement with the conclusion of her paragraph. "The challenge of the Cross is, in the midst of suffering, to affirm one's relatedness to others and one's service to them as the meaning of one's existence, and to do this out of love for and obedience to the en- compassing and deliberate power sustaining and calling life." For me, the cross indicates and evokes a possible requirement of theocentric piety and fidelity; that fidelity requires that I be ready to be self-denying in service to others and the wide ordering of creation, not as the meaning of my existence, but in faithfulness to the powers that create, sustain, etc., etc. Cahill wants to avoid "cheap grace," but it is a question of the reality and efficacy of grace in the world. At what point does the assurance that every- thing will come out all right in the end blur the Christian's perception of suf- fering in the world? At what point does it easily resolve the problem of being and value in favor of a dogmatic assertion that where there is being, there is value for man? And finally, does it lead to the slave morality that Nietzsche so powerfully depicts? Are the assurances of grace such that no experiential evidence can ever count against them? Maybe I am too much a common sense thinker, but it seems to me that if I can be grateful to God for those things that are beneficial to humanity and life in the world, I can have enmity toward God for a lot of suffering. If this is not the case, Cahill and others perhaps ought to reintroduce the Devil into theology and ethics so they can relieve God of blame. Theoretical monotheists with a transcendent gracious God perhaps have to be practical Manicheans. If God is like us, God must surely be suffering. I say this because if I could affirm a more anthropomorphic view of the Deity, much of the way in which I view the world could be stated in terms used by Moltmann and Kitamori. If I were persuaded by the arguments of the process theologians, toward whom there is clearly an opening in my work, I could explicate how events in the world, because of the internal relations with the Deity, have effects on the Divine. I can say that God is involved in both the benefits and sufferings of life in the world as the author, orderer, and end of all things. Perhaps the suffering of the world does somehow redound to the glory of God, but the manifestations of the presence of God in the world are not uniformly beneficial to the human species. On the relations of God to the world, I find much of Edwards to be per- suasive. Whether Ramsey or I am correct in interpreting Edwards is a matter for another time. Whether Edwards exerts a greater influence on Ramsey's or on my theology and ethics is also not a matter worthy of discussion; on that, however, I believe the greater influence is on my work. (Of course, Ram- sey does not claim significant influence of Edwards on his own work; his Ed-</page><page sequence="17">A Response to Critics 201 wards studies are seemingly an important side venture from which we all reap great benefit.) The point with reference to this final theme in re: Edwards is this: my efforts to think about the relations of God to the world have been more deeply informed by Edwards than by any other single theologian. If this theme is misconstrued, not seen for its importance, other aspects of my work cannot be adequately perceived. If Ramsey will permit me to cite a title from Edwards as a capstone for this theme, though it does not accurately encapsulate my view, it is this: "Images and Shadows of Divine Things." This leads to the theme of the relations of theology to ethics. McCormick says that "cosmocentrism need not eliminate anthropocentrism." Theocen- trism does not eliminate value for the human, but the two cannot be one un- less it is proven that the "values" and "purposes" of (to use McCormick's term) the cosmos are identical with what fulfills human values and purposes, or more strongly, if the divine ends are identical with human fulfillment. Maybe one could have an ellipse with two poles - God and human - but I think there is no persuasive evidence that the Deity as the center of value and being is identical with the value of the human. I find his brief argument in which he comes to the conclusion that the late development of humanity can be read as God's lavish way of making human life the crown of creation to be implausible. I noted speculatively somewhere that life might have evolved elsewhere so that there are beings who would view us as we view animals. And our crowning capacities are such that we might be the destroyers of con- ditions that sustain life on this planet: humanity might be Siva. I will not elaborate further on the relation of theology to ethics, but only remind my critics that this is developed in my two volumes in relation to piety, tradition, and how things really and ultimately are. Ethics is developed in the context of piety, the human fault, and conversion; moral reasoning is rooted in them as well as in the way things really are. I now turn to some comments on each of the articles and the letter. ///. REMARKS ON INDIVIDUAL CRITICS The four articles each have a structure which enables me to respond to them in a way that I have not in my discussion of themes. The letter, how- ever, is impossible to respond to as a whole. Hauerwas I shall add little to what I have said. I read the article in simple terms. Gustafson was a "historicist," but is less one now than he once was. There- fore he aspires to be a "universalist." But he cannot quite make up his mind. One has to be either a universalist or an historicist. Hauerwas claims to be</page><page sequence="18">202 The Journal of Religious Ethics a consistent historicist because that's where God began. My previous responses to Hauerwas indicate my position in regard to his article. This position is theologically and religiously reductionistic and logically untenable, as I have argued earlier. McCormick McCormick chooses to read my two volumes as "a personal faith state- ment," though he admits that it is "a bit of both" that and "a theological explanation . . . open to public view." That is an interesting move. While he is moved to argue with it sometimes as a theological explanation open to pub- lic view, he has laid the ground for dismissing it because it is a "faith state- ment." I have addressed all I wish to his arguments against mine and have raised some questions about his "faith statement." He is really writing about beliefs, and shows that his, using Protestants more than Roman Catholics, are Christian beliefs. Mine are not Christian by his standards. Why his last remark is given in the form of a question I do not understand. His answer to it is clear. Gustafson's view of God is not Christian. Therefore his ethics is not Christian. That is clearly what he means. And he knows that nowhere in two volumes have I used the adjective Christian for the theological ethics. For many reasons I am glad I do not belong to McCormick's Church, but particularly since he has seen fit to indict me for heresy. With my position clearly stated, his rebuttal of it and his own orthodox Christian view stated, and his weight as a responsible theologian for added authority, I would be surely summoned by some ecclesiastical agency. Perhaps he should send a copy of his article to the Chicago Association of the Illinois Conference of the United Church of Christ so they can start heresy proceedings against me. I will not voluntarily demit the Christian ministry until I am persuaded that my piety and beliefs are beyond the pale; when I am persuaded, I shall demit. I am not worried about my eternal destiny, and I think a statement of my personal faith would be very unimportant. But I must say that I worry a great deal (as I have said previously in this article) about the intellectual and moral life of the Christian community. I noted earlier that I was not surprised when McCormick showed how one could come to some of my moral conclusions from ethics from an anthro- pocentric perspective; I never said one could not. One would always come to a different judgment only if ethics from a theocentric perspective ruled out all consideration of human values. From my chapter on suicide McCormick does not comment on the follow- ing: "Physical life is not of ultimate value; many persons who suffer acutely are in no way accountable for their sufferings. Suffering is inflicted on them, and it can be a morally proper choice to seek the relief of death for their own sake and for that of others." I know McCormick does not disagree with</page><page sequence="19">A Response to Critics 203 the first phrase, but I wonder if he is willing to provide a moral justification for suicide. If he is, I believe my arguments would be different from his in both theological and ethical aspects. Perhaps I should have written a chapter on abortion; I did not because who wants to read one more piece on that issue? I would be very interested if McCormick would justify abortions I would argue are permissible, based upon concerns for patterns and processes of interdependence of life and for the common good of particular wholes. I will not cite cases; I just ask Mc- Cormick to think about this. Further, the ordering of issues in terms of their importance for moral atten- tion might well be different in my work from an anthropocentric perspective. I noted somewhere in volume one that elements necessary for the continua- tion of all of life, such as oxygen and nitrogen, might be of more value than a lot of things on which moralists lavish attention because they are the nec- essary conditions of all of life. Although the scientific jury on nuclear winter is still out, from a theocentric perspective the issues are serious enough to be higher on the priority list than most things occupying medical moralists. Life, not only human life, or a human person, is threatened by nuclear war. McCormick notes my preference of voluntary restraints of family size. It is too bad that his church is so officially human-centered that it does not per- mit the means to make voluntary restraints practicable to many persons. I argue that restraints are in part necessary, for the sake of a larger whole - life on the planet. Can that be argued from anthropocentric ethics? And I note he does not comment on 1984: 248, note 17, to say whether he agrees that economic disincentives to larger families are permissible - for the sake of life on the planet and not just persons. But at least McCormick ought to be re- lieved that my heretical beliefs and unchristian ethics are not totally inhumane. Cahill I get the impression that Cahill is trying to find clues to understand her former instructor. She perceptively sees the importance of suffering and evil and, curiously, does not cite the passage in which I address it illustratively in a more comprehensive way than her own illustrations, namely the opening section of "Population and Nutrition," 1984: 219-21. My Ethics was not writ- ten, however, to provide a theodicy (or an absence of one, in traditional terms). When I worked through my arguments about God and God's relations to man and the world, and man and man's relations to God and the world, the conclusions to which I come about suffering and evil follow from the theol- ogy. She comes to different conclusions from mine as a result of the theology she outlines. On that matter I have remarked previously in this article. Her interests in my use of family anecdotes suggests further evidence that Cahill is trying to figure out what makes me think the way I do. The parable</page><page sequence="20">204 The Journal of Religious Ethics at the end of her article, with its unquestionable charm, leaves me with the impression that as far as Cahill is concerned I can, like my grandfather, work all alone at my intellectual forge although there are reasons for others to go home. Go home, I think, is precisely what too many theologians do rather than take into account the issues I have responded to theologically and ethi- cally. It is all part of the intellectual sectarianism that so tempts theologians. Theologians have no reason to charge academic life with compartmentaliza- tion, overspecialization, narrowness of interest, etc., when with or without sophisticated philosophical defenses they refuse to be challenged by their col- leagues in other disciplines. Toulmin Of my five critics Toulmin provides the most sympathetic interpretation. And its basic lines are, in my judgement, accurate. This not only interests me, but pleases me, since Toulmin is one historian and philosopher who is open to theological discussion based upon interpretation of the natural order. I do not know how many other scientists, philosophers, and other humanists have read my work. Perhaps the recent history of my extra-classroom activi- ties and cross-disciplinary teaching is what in part leads me to take more se- riously than many of my colleagues in theology and ethics the ways in which the world is construed in other parts of university teaching and research and in the professions. If, as I have said, theology says something about how things really and ultimately are, some clues to that must come from those who in- form us in more detail than theologians say about how many things at least penultimately are. Toulmin raises the question of Stoicism, and it is implied by other critics as well. My reading of Calvin is that he had to strive with some effort to distinguish some of his theological conclusions from Stoicism. Although I have not satisfied Cahill with my efforts to argue that one cannot say God is nature without remainder, piety and tradition, as well as a sense of the mystery beyond our capacities to comprehend, force me to acknowledge a transcendence of the Deity that is not found in traditional Stoics. None of my critics notes the importance of the lines from "Paradise Lost" and Lin- coln which provide a leitmotif to my conclusion. Further, the developments of the sciences, about which Toulmin is far better informed than I and from whom I have learned much, indicate that process and change are part of the reality of the world in which we have evolved ourselves through change. Thus a "staticism" of traditional Stoicism no longer is viable. Our participation increasingly affects the natural and social order of things; there is no natural harmony in which all things work together for the good of all things, not to mention those who love the Lord. One reason I cannot provide more cer- tainty about the values and principles that are grounded in the ordering of</page><page sequence="21">A Response to Critics 205 life is that the ordering itself undergoes change, more dramatically in history and culture but also in nature itself. And the changes are increasingly out- comes of human participation. My "Book of Nature" (see McCormick) has to be different from the Stoics' and from Thomas Aquinas'. If apathy is the response to the world in Stoicism, it is not my response. With capacities to participate in life, we are not called upon to be simply re- signed. Again Cahill seems to have missed my discussion in which I distinguish between resignation and consent. Consent for me is informed by Edwards and other eighteenth-century uses of the term. It is an inward disposition which alters our sense of participation. I not only resign myself to my forthcoming death; I consent to the divine ordering of the world; God created me to die, among other things. Nor does Stoicism back the self-denial that my work requires. But surely Toulmin is correct that my construal of the world is more akin to the Stoics than to other philosophical descriptions that inform other theological construals except process theology. Should I blush with shame for that? I do not, since I have given reasons why I come to my conclusions. My critics who call me a Stoic have to make an argument against those rea- sons, and not simply appeal to historic revelation as an alternative. Toulmin understands that, and I am grateful for his saying it. Ramsey Ramsey's choice to write a sixty-page manuscript letter rather than an arti- cle makes it impossible to respond to him adequately. Ramsey obviously en- joyed writing that letter and readers who know Ramsey will enjoy both the style and the substance. Readers who do not know him, however, are likely to be puzzled by the combination of careful argumentation, gratuitous re- marks, exposition of his own work, and humorous asides. It reads like no other article they have read in a scholarly journal. Ramsey freely graded as- pects of my work; it takes restraint on my part not to reciprocate with ref- erence to his letter. I have attempted to sort out which of Ramsey's criticisms seem to him to be most telling. I conclude that, while he thinks my theology is dead wrong (and I have commented a bit on that above), his real worry is my ethical the- ory. In my section on Ramsey as a benchmark, I credited him with coherence between his theology and his ethical theory, though I wrote more about love than covenant (but did write also about the latter). Ramsey is worried that the ethics which follow from my theology cannot come to the kind of closure, to say the number of firm "no's" that he finds important. While he does, in his typical prose, seek to find incoherence between my theology and ethics, he falls into the same error that McCormick does, namely arguing that one can be theocentric and anthropocentric at the same time. I have already re- marked on the priority of covenant to creation in Ramsey's theology, i.e., a</page><page sequence="22">206 The Journal of Religious Ethics very Barthian move, and asked where the doctrine of creation fits his theol- ogy and ethics. I have long noted that his interests in natural law theory have always eschewed the ontological underpinnings of it in its historic form; he adapts decision procedures from it to his own theology and interests. He can do that if he chooses, but it points to the virtual elimination of the natural ordering as a basis of ethics in his work. Again, where is the doctrine of creation? My impression, upon reflection, is that Ramsey is finally most interested in developing a pattern of practical reasoning which avoids evil acts. I noted above that I do not blush because long-range consequences have to be taken into account in my theological ethics; the theology I develop and the descrip- tive statement of man as participant in patterns and processes of interdepen- dence make that necessary. The description of morally relevant circumstances is necessarily larger and more complex than is the case in his work; I indi- cated that and reasons for it in my section on him. If life in the world is in- terdependent to the extent and in the many dimensions I describe, it is simply a contraction of theological and moral vision that keeps agents from taking broad and long-range views of things. I agree with Ramsey's worry that evil can follow from the intention to achieve benefits for others. I agree with our common mentor, H. Richard Niebuhr, that there are occasions on which the gracious thing is to do noth- ing, and have so argued. If I recall correctly, Ramsey published a paper in which he argued that the procedure of amniocentisis was immoral because it could cause harm to the fetus. I am clearly more impressed than Ramsey is that the avoidance of evil as the primary ethical precept can preempt the development of beneficial outcomes to large numbers of persons. Amnio- centisis has proved beneficial; I suppose there is no way of confirming ab- solutely that some slight pain or harm has been done to fetal life by it. If Ramsey wonders about whether I can close to a negative, which I can on many things, I can wonder with equal looseness whether Ramsey could even say that something ought to be done for the benefit of others at the risk of caus- ing some harm to innocent persons without their consent. The theology I have developed backs an ethics that is ready to say there might be occasions on which such initiatives are permissible. And they would not necessarily be more tragic than refraining from doing something judged evil at the cost of outcomes that would benefit others. Such are the inevitabilities of human finitude. Ramsey does not take up directly one of the crucial bases on which I cannot provide the kind of eternal moral certainty he thinks is necessary, namely the idea that culture, history, selves, and even nature are in processes of development, as well as continuity. This means, for me, that normally one applies tried-and-true principles, values, and rules to the novelty that occurs. But it also means that one is open to the possibility of revision of some of</page><page sequence="23">A Response to Critics 207 the principles and rules, and a reordering of the priority of values. For exam- ple, a respect for the natural world that I learned as a very small child from my Swedish father has become an arena of great concern in my adulthood because of our perceptions of harms done to it in many ways. This does not lead to a Schweitzerian or Jainist near-animism and nature mysticism, but it reorders historically and politically some traditional values which I argue are grounded in the anthropocentrism of Western culture. I do not know how much ethics will change in the next centuries, but if the cultural changes con- tinue to occur at the rate they have in the past century, I predict that some things now permitted will be prohibited and perhaps some things now pro- hibited will be permitted, that some things now high on the customary scale of values will be lowered and some things relatively low will be raised. And I predict that nothing will be less ambiguous in the future than things, in my interpretation, now are. God is ordermg; humanity is intervening; some other tradition may be dominant in even our geographic part of the world; neither God nor humanity is dependent upon historic Christianity as we now know it to continue to seek to discern the proper relations of all things to God. Ramsey's practical ethics are, as I noted previously, quite rationalistic. "So little knows / Any, but God alone, to value right / The good before him. . . ." My discussion of general rules, etc., in my concluding chapter was an effort to show how various rational procedures can be seen to be part of the process of discernment. If one reads the final chapters of both volumes with care, one will see that I argue for rational activity in discernment but do not limit discernment to it. I am concerned about our being as well as our doing. Here I think I am more biblical and Edwardsian than Ramsey. To be sure, the casuistry of the legal codes in the Torah provides exemplary rational proce- dures. But I can also quote the Psalms: the Fifty-First: "Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward being; therefore teach me wisdom in my secret heart." "Create in me a clean heart, O God, and put a new and right spirit within me." In my reading of the Bible, morality is often and clearly understood to be a matter of one's loves and loyalties, and of one's affections, one's heart. If one of the roots of our sin is in the heart, then one of the roots of our conversion is also in the heart. Ramsey clearly does not like the way in which I accuse many moralists, including Kant, of developing ethics so that the prime interest is the protec- tion of the moral purity of the agent. I am not deterred by his comments on that. And I find deep historic Christian bases for another view - a very orthodox interpretation of the crucifixion. God permitted an evil deed, the death of Jesus, for the sake of its benefits to others. That kind of piety and fidelity informs my convictions. For Ramsey, perhaps the most important point of the crucifixion is that Jesus gave his informed consent to the invasive pro- cedure. I am impressed with the way in which both Luther and Calvin in- terpret the second table of the decalogue so that the proscriptions become</page><page sequence="24">208 The Journal of Religious Ethics prescriptions to do good for others. My interpretation of Christian morality is, to put it tritely, that it stresses doing good for others more than it stresses worrying about the blame that can be put on an agent who might cause some harm in the course of meeting the needs of the neighbor. The ordering of life in the world is such, as I have argued in my work, that neither Ramsey's ethics nor mine can guarantee that the outcomes of human initiatives will be free of ambiguity. Ramsey obviously has to reject a pattern of thought which my theology makes central to the ethical task, namely thinking of the relations of parts to whole. If I recall Ramsey's writings with some accuracy, the idea of a common good is not important in his work of the last decades. (I acknowledge the risk in saying this, since Ramsey remembers his work so well he will no doubt find evidence to rebut this.) And since human beings are part of a larger whole, I necessarily have to give fairly high priority to issues which threaten the nonhuman world and not only for the sake of the preservation of human life. Many other aspects of his letter remain unattended in this response, but not because I cannot defend myself. The interpretation of Edwards is a side issue and worth scholarly discussion, but I never claimed to be faithful to Edwards. My thinking is deeply informed by Edwards, and as I noted above, I think more so than is Ramsey's - but that is also irrelevant. I began this article by acknowledging that my five critics have been more than casual friends of mine over the years. I have fulfilled an obligation to respond in gratitude to the attention they lavished on my work, and attempted to do so within a reasonable amount of space. I have never been a good po- lemicist (indeed, I recall Ramsey once calling me an irenicist). I hope that bonds of friendship are not broken by what I have written. More than that I hope, though I have reasons to doubt, that this exercise contributes to the development of theological ethics. NOTES This article is the fruit of intensive study by three others, Stephen S. Bowen, Per Anderson, and William Schweiker, as well as myself, of the four articles and the letter published in the previous number of JRE. At least seven hours of intensive discussion with them took place. It is unfair to submit it under only my authorship, since I do not indicate points at which insights of each of them have shaped what I have written. It would, unfortunately, be equally unfair to submit it under joint authorship, since not all of their contributions are included and each would have said what is included somewhat differently than I do. Certainly the article was written "in collaboration with" these men. The many hours each spent helping me to do something I find very distasteful, namely staring at myself in a mirror and writing about my own publica- tions, is a manifestation of self-denial on their parts for the sake of a friend and col- league. My gratitude to them is very deep.</page><page sequence="25">A Response to Critics 209 REFERENCES Gerrish, B.
