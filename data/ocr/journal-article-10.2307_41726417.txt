<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Treasure ci the Golden Mound by VIKTOR SARIANIDI Translated by Olga Soffer The cities Yemshi-tepe, monumental of the Bactrian one ruins of the Empire, of few the ancient large lie where remaining city the of Yemshi-tepe, one of the few large remaining cities of the Bactrian Empire, lie where the northern foothills of Hindu Kush almost abut the sands of Amu Darya on a narrow fertile strip watered by the Safid Rud River. Tucked far away in Central Asia, these ancient mounds may appear insignificant and monotonous at first glance. Most of them still await their archaeological re- searchers. Those few that have been examined to date promise brilliant finds for the future. Proof can be found in the discoveries of the Soviet- Afghanistan Archaeological Expedition which in 1978 conducted annual fieldwork in this region of northern Afghanistan. Archaeological investiga- tion began exactly ten years ago when the Soviet- Afghanistan Expedition arrived in Shibergan and set as its goal a thorough investigation of the * legendary Bactria. During the second millennium b.c. a highly developed farming civilization ap- peared on both banks of the Amu Darya River. By the sixth century b.c. this large area, known as Bactria, developed into a state, only to be con- quered by the Achaemenids. Alexander the Great added Bactria to his empire during the fourth century. Still later during the first century after Christ, the powerful Kushan kingdom was formed. The city of Yemshi-tepe, once fortified by défense May/ June 1980 31</page><page sequence="2">towers and mighty city walls, safely concealed the residences of these local rulers. Exploratory excavations on Yemshi-tepe proved that an important capital city existed dur- ing Kushan times, dating from the first to fourth centuries after Christ. Its origins probably date to Early Kushan or even Greco-Bactrian times, 200 years earlier. The Soviet- Afghanistan Expedition investigated only the private dwellings inside the city as well as the massive defense walls. Many other small mounds and hillocks around Yemshi- tepe were not excavated. One of them, Tillya- tepe - the "Golden Mound" - attracted attention because pot sherds found there differed radically from others in the area. They included hand- thrown painted pottery sherds decorated with geometric designs - a type known only from the southern regions of Central Asia where they date to the end of the second millennium b.c. Sites of this age were not known in Bactria to date. This discovery set off a series of test excavations which established that the mound originated at the end of the second millennium b.c. and existed until the middle of the first millennium b.c. when it was abandoned. These findings were significant enough to warrant excavations in 1970. In the interim, however, construction of the Mazar-i- Sharif-Shibergan highway began and in the course of road construction powerful steam shovels destroyed the entire central part of the mound. As it turned out, however, they missed some remark- ably rich burials by some three to five meters. Salvage excavations in the following 197 1 field season revealed that a monumental structure once stood on the site of Tilly a-tepe. Excavation would require a great expenditure of both labor and funds. Meanwhile, Bronze Age sites were dis- covered near the city of Balkh, and all the forces of the Soviet- Afghanistan Expedition were directed toward their investigation. Then, in 1977, it was decided to return to Tilly a-tepe. Excavations docu- mented the ruins of the mound which contained the remains of monumental architecture erected on a six-meter brick platform. This structure was fortified on the outside with a mighty defensive wall which itself was additionally fortified with round turrets. On the inside the structure con- sisted of two large public halls which contained columns and remains of an altar on the floor. During 1978, a fourth effort was made to de- cipher the secrets of Tillya-tepe when the Soviet- Afghanistan Expedition concentrated all of its field research exclusively at Tillya-tepe. The work at this not too impressive a mound, measuring about 100 meters in diameter and about three meters in height, was rewarded with a truly regal gift: the discovery of ancient tombs and magnifi- cent gold burial goods. Six burials have been dis- covered to date. Their construction is amazingly simple in comparison with the richness of their contents. This contrast of the simple pits and lavish burial goods suggests that the interments took place under cover in strict secrecy from the city dwellers. Additionally, the objects found in the tombs suggested that the deceased were placed in the ground somewhere around the beginning of the Christian era - at a time when Tillya-tepe it- self had been abandoned for about 500 years and lay in ruins. It is precisely during this time that the ancient classical city of Yemshi-tepe founded nearby led us to suppose that during the Early Kushan period, dating to the first century after Christ, Yemshi-tepe served as a residental district for local rulers. In contrast to many other nobles, the residents of Yemshi-tepe placed their family cemetery not in- side the town but rather on the abandoned mound of Tillya-tepe located some 450 to 500 meters away from their homes. It is significant that all of the known burials are located only on the northwest- ern part of Tillya-tepe, the side turned toward Yemshi-tepe, which can be easily observed from the high citadel. This location permitted the rela- tives of the deceased to watch over their necropolis without leaving city boundaries, merely by look- ing out of the windows of their palace. The burials may have taken place at night when the simple straight-sided graves were dug in the ruins of Tillya-tepe in a matter of two to three hours. The graves were often not even plastered with clay on the inside and held wooden coffins, some on short legs. The sides of the coffins were fastened to their bottoms with iron clamps and were draped with coverlets embroidered and dec- orated with silver and gold discs. Apparently, the graves had no lids and averaged 3 by 1.5 meters. Wooden scaffolds were placed about 1.5 meters above the grave floor so that coffins at first stood on them. With time, after the collapse of the wooden superstructure, the graves filled with loose piled-up soil. There were absolutely no structures erected on top of the graves; the only object found on top of one grave was a horse skull wrapped in hide - obviously a nomadic custom. The deceased lay fully extended on their backs in the coffins; among the six burials found, four have their heads to the north and two west. The coffin in burial #4 was wrapped in hides decorated in a red and black stream-like design. Grave #3 was the only one located on the dry elevated part of Tillya-tepe and as a result underwent extensive damage from rodent burrowing. All of the other graves are located at the bottom of the mound, the part that is next to the present-day cotton fields. Unfortunately, the skeletal preservation in the graves is rather poor due to repeated irrigation. Because of this, the sex and age identifications done by R. Palval, an anthropologist at Kabul Uni- (Right) The magnificent gold buckle from grave #3 depicts a warrior wearing a horned helmet and holding a spear and shield.

Grave #1 may have con- tained a female, 25-30 years old; grave #2 was a male, 40-45 years old; #3 was badly disturbed by burrowing and contained almost no skeletal re- mains; grave #4 held a male, about 50 years old; #5 is a female about 30 years old; and grave #6 is also a female about 40 years old. As a rule, gold buckles were found on the chest of each person. The body in grave #3 had three buckles found one on top of the other, suggesting that the deceased was buried wearing at least three layers of clothing. The garments themselves were richly decorated with hollow gold plates sewn onto the cloth. After the cloth itself decomposed the plates collapsed on top of each other, thereby complicating the reconstruction of the relation- ship of plates and garments. Each burial contains on the average between 2,500 and 4,000 gold pieces, all of which created a chaotic jumble after the disintegration of the cloth. It was only after painstaking layer-by-layer excavation that we were able to reconstruct the original designs of each garment. A wide variety of convex sew-on gold plates make up the bulk of grave goods, including round, square and rectangular shapes as well as plates shaped like figurines. They were all manufactured by the process of forcing gold leaf into special molds. Their surfaces are often decorated with re- lief ornamentation and the lower borders contain openings for sewing the plates onto the garments. A smaller number of plates are cast with indenta- tions for encrustation. They come in the shape of "beetles" with turquoise lazurite insets or "little hearts" with turquoise. Many of these plates have small tubes welded on their back through which thread was passed for sewing them onto the gar- ments. The clothes themselves were made of cot- ton and silk fabrics and were often embroidered with gold threads and ornamental pearls. Pendants in the shape of flowers, rosettes and the heads of animals were also very popular and had additional gold discs attached to them with thin wires. It is easy to imagine how hundreds and thousands of these pendants, tinkling and gleam- ing in the sunlight, cast an almost celestial light on their wearers. There is no doubt that members of the royal dynasty were buried in these graves. Simple mesh gold crowns and other more complex ones in the form of metal forehead ribbons, dec- orated with sculptured flowers encrusted with pearls and turquoise, were also uncovered. Small welded-on tubes attached five different palmettes vertically to these gold ribbons. Each represented stylized trees with birds on their boughs, en- crusted with white pearls. Thin gold metal ribbons sometimes decorated on the borders with gold flowers encircled the lower jaws of the deceased. The gold hoard at Tillya-tepe also contained necklaces (in grave #3, one weighed about one kilogram) made of large hollow beads decorated with small gold granules and encrusted with tur- quoise rosettes. Massive open-ended gold bracelets graced the wrists of the deceased. Two types of 34 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">Detail of a gold bracelet in the form of a sculptured antelope with turquoise details. Width of bracelet, 8.5 by 6.5 centimeters. bracelets stand out in the collection, their open ends terminating in sculptured figurines of ani- mals. The person in grave #2 wore gold bracelets cast in the shape of racing antelopes on both wrists. The front legs of the animals are thrown forward as if they were in flight; the heads have clearly fashioned faces with large eyes, delineated nostrils and mouths, and pushed back ears and horns. The long, slightly bent bodies end in hind legs and short tails. Some parts of the antelopes are richly encrusted with turquoise insets, for ex- ample, the hoofs, ears and horns. Fine detailing appears around the eyes, the corners of which hold miniature turquoise beads, while the pupils are made in the form of yellowish carnelian beads. Another deceased wore arm bracelets ending in sculptured heads of grimacing carnivores and threatening features reminiscent of the bracelets from the Amu Darya hoard now in the British Museum. This remarkable collection of jewelry and coins ranges in date from the fifth century b.c. to the first century after Christ. The fingers of the deceased were covered with rings which often have set-in stones. Particularly effective is a massive, hollow ring whose shield- like front is decorated with the image of a sitting Athena holding a spear and shield in her left hand and wearing long robes and a war helmet. The decoration has the inscription "Athena" in Greek letters executed in mirror image - a fact undoubt- edly indicating that the ring served as a seal. Additional massive gold bracelets, each weighing about 500 grams and found in most of the graves, were placed on the ankles. Cast gold buckles are also found near the legs of the buried nobility. The most notable of these comes from grave #4 where one round gold buckle in the form of massive gold circles decorated on the border with turquoise inlays was found near each ankle. Inside each circle is a chariot on small wheels encrusted with turquoise; each chariot has a mushroom-shaped canopy with bamboo poles fastened on top of it. A human figure with a thrown-back face and small braid at the nape of the neck sits in each chariot. The face with slanted eyes most probably represents a Chinese male who is dressed in a robe with wide sleeves and quilted collar. A pair of fantastic lion-like winged crea- tures are harnessed onto the chariots, their muz- zles held with bits and the reins held tightly in the fists of the riders. These buckles resemble the shoe buckles on the famous statue of the Kushan king Kanishka from the excavations of Surkh Rotale, a Kushan shrine in northern Afghanistan. Because the sew-on plates or pendants, as a rule, are located from the neck to the hip area, the deceased were probably dressed in short shirts or caftans and long trousers. Long robes with borders were also covered with similar gold pendants. The plates sewn onto clothing are in the shape of a man with a dolphin thrown over the shoulder; others are figures of musicians, human images above the waist encircled in gold with additional gold discs dangling below the plates.

Remnants of cloth embroidered with gold threads and pearls. representations of winged goddesses, however, merit special attention. In one case, a semi-nude female figure with a wide face and prominent cheekbones is depicted with an upswept hair-do. Her torso is criss-crossed with belts or straps; her small breasts protrude between these belts. The body is unclad above the hips. A small figure of a winged Eros with bow in hand appears near one shoulder - an image which may suggest that this is a local rendering of the Greek goddess Aphro- dite. The sculpture strongly attests to the fact that two distinct cultural traditions are blending: a local Bactrian one and a foreign Greek one. The short and stocky build of the figure and her "Asiatic" face undoubtedly show a local rendering of a winged diety, while the general draping of the garments and particularly the figure of Eros un- questionably point to Greek influence. In the sec- ond example of a goddess, we also find a semi-clad winged female figure, but this time with a differ- ent rendering of the face and with a caste mark on the middle of the forehead. The rest of the body, excluding the ankle bracelets, is identical to the other representation of Aphrodite. wide variety of hair pins with bronze bottom halves and gold top parts attest to the fine skills and techniques of metalworking in ancient Bac- tria. In one case a 12-petaled rosette with loops on each petal once held dangling discs. In another example, the top of the pin is in the form of a gold disc with pearls strung on top of the disc. Half- moon pendants, each of which has a gold disc dangling on fine wires below, hang from the disc. In the series of gold plates one particular exam- ple stands out: it is composed of two horses en- crusted with turquoise with discs, hearts and leaves dangling from it on fine chains. A special place among the plates must also undoubtedly be allocated to the two cast objects found in grave #2 on each side of the skull. They are bifacial and depict the struggle of a ruler with two dragons. The ruler is depicted in the center of the pendant wearing a step-like crown encrusted with tur- quoise and lapis lazuli. His wide cheekbones are framed by long hair, his forehead bears in the center a caste mark, and his slanted and slightly elongated eyes are accented with bent eyebrows. The thrust forward, willful chin completes the image of a strong ruler. He is dressed in a short caftan which freely overlaps on the chest and is caught at the waist by a sash. The caftan is open below the waist. The lower part of the body is draped in soft folds of clothing richly encrusted with turquoise insets. His spread-apart arms ter- minate in tight fists, each touching a winged, horned dragon. The horse-like faces of the dragons wear menacing grins with bared teeth - they too are decorated with eye insets. Their upraised manes are covered with turquoise insets and the bent bodies of these two fantastic creatures end in hind legs which are unnaturally turned upwards. 36 Archaeology</page><page sequence="7">(From top) Mirror image gold buckle depicting a possible " sacred marriage width , 7 by 6.5 centimeters.

Gold chains descend from this composition holding discs and miniature plates decorated with tur- quoise insets and gold granules. The whole richly decorated scene reflects a mighty all-powerful king who conquers even fan- tastic creatures. A similar theme is reflected in two other pendants found on the skull in grave #6. The same scene is depicted on both: a nearly nude female figure, front-face, whose left hand is placed on her breast and holds a fruit, while the right hand is at the side of the body. Soft folds of cloth descend from the hips leaving an open triangle below the abdomen. Two legs are suggested under the clothing folds; the left one is slightly to the front. On each side of the female are open-jawed carnivores with their heads hanging down. Their hind quarters end in fish tails. The base of this pendant is encrusted with turquoise insets and ends in two fish heads. Birds are found in the corners of the upper part of the pendant. The faintly smiling, triumphant face of the female per- sonifies power and control over the plant world as exemplified by the fruit in her hands, and the animal world as seen in the animals, fish and birds. This figurine represents the mistress of the animal and plant worlds - in all probability the goddess Anahita with all her attributes. Appar- ently the placement of these pendants in the grave with a female was not accidental. Judging by the gold crown also found in the burial, she held a high rank and the pendants apparently emphasized her influence and prestige in real life. The buckles which were found on the chests of the buried nobles probably served to fasten man- tles or long robes. In addition to plain gold buckles, the collection from Tillya-tepe also contains more complex ones which are artistically executed in the forms of winged cupids sitting astride fish, possibly dolphins. These are also richly encrusted with turquoise inlays. The large buckle found on the chest of the skeleton in grave #3 consists of two parts each bearing an identical image. The buckle was cast by a complex cut-through technique. In the center of each half stands a warrior who wears a helmet and holds a spear and shield. On his side hangs a sword on a strap whose handle is in the shape of an owl's head. Two small dragons are near his feet, a pair of birds (possibly eagles) appear near the head, each holding flowing ribbons in its beak. This figure reminds one of the war god Ares as he is depicted on the Parthian rhytons from Nisa. The horns on the helmet are also similar to the name "two horned Alexander" which was used in the East as a name for the famed ruler, Alexan- der the Great of Macedonia. Directly below this buckle lay another one in the form of cupids riding fish. Under these lay two smaller gold buckles shaped like mandolins and encrusted with tur- quoise insets. Undoubtedly the buckle from grave #6 holds a special place in the gold collection from Tillya- tepe. It is made in two parts with identical images May/June 1980 37</page><page sequence="8">(From top) Gold blade with the image of an antelope being torn apart by a panther ; 5.1 by 4.3 centimeters.

It too is heavily encrusted with turquoise. Each of the two halves represents a large figure of a fantastic creature with a lion head with bared teeth. The eyes of the creature are narrowed in anger and a bushy beard appears below its chin. The bent neck is decorated with turquoise insets placed in a saw-tooth pattern. He wears a saddle decorated with an embracing couple: a male and a female who at the same time are also in the em- brace of the creature. Behind the couple stands a winged Nike with a wreath in one hand and a palm frond in the other. In front of this creature reclines a siline. He is holding up a rhyton shaped like a horned goat. In all probability this scene is as- sociated with the ritual of a "sacred marriage." T he art of the early Kushans is replete with animal imagery - mute testimony to the nomadic origins of these people. This can easily be seen in burial #4 which stands out because of the abund- ance of its inventory. Here lies a warrior, almost two meters tall, buried with a rich collection of personal weapons all encased in a leather sword shoulder belt decorated with gold pendants. Espe- cially notable is a series of semicircular plates cast with high reliefs bearing images of both realistic and fantastic twisted animals, some biting their own legs and tails or simply baring their teeth. Two other pendants in this fantastic burial are decorated with a motif echoing the "Siberian ani- mal style." One of them bears the image of an antelope lying down, her head twisted back, with a feline carnivore on her back. The predator's teeth sink deeply into the antelope's flank. Another pen- dant depicts a horse, also lying down, the head turned in a backward glance. Two fantastic winged beasts have frenzily hurled themselves at the horse, one attacking the body and the other the flank of the horse. This theme of an attack by carnivores, including mythical ones, and of resting animals was widespread among the nomads. A small gold statue of a mountain auroch was placed near the head of this burial. It is executed with supreme and unsurpassed mastery - not only are the muscles visible but even each vein of the animal can be seen beneath his satiny skin. Two enormous bent and twisted horns encircle a small head atop a gently twisting neck. The large and well nourished body of the animal sits on graceful, slender legs which end in small circles and suggest that this figurine was reused in the burial. In its first function it was probably part of a more comp- lex sculptural composition. The waistline of the deceased in grave #4 is encircled with a wide gold belt with nine round pendants. Each of these depicts in high relief a woman sitting on a lion. This composition appears on all of the pendants but in each case with a slight modification. The lion stands in profile with his head turned back as if scowling. He has a saddle on 38 Archaeology</page><page sequence="9">(From top) Gold plate of ruler with two dragons found in grave # 2 ; 12.5 by 6.5 centimeters.

On top of a lion sits a woman with a very sharp, if not angry, expression on her face. One arm rests on the lion's head; in the other hand she is holding a vessel with two handles. Her legs, spread apart, hang under a short little skirt; the feet are dressed in high sandals. The same female figure is de- picted on another pendant with the vessel held close to one breast while the other hand is squeez- ing milk from the breast into the vessel. It seems likely that the female figure depicted on the belt represents the goddess Nani or Nanai, the Bactrian mistress of the animals. By the right side of the body lay an iron dagger with a gold handle in a gold scabbard. An attack scene of both realistic and fantastic animals ap- pears in high relief on the casing, again richly encrusted with turquoise. Here in a long line stand winged griffins, fanged dragons and feline carniv- ores - each has his teeth sunk into the flanks of the animal in front of him. This scene extends onto the handle of the dagger and ends on a rounded top where, quite unexpectedly, a bear is represented sucking a grape vine. In this single example, as if in a trick or prank, we see the rich sense of humor of the Bactrians. They are able to end a menacing tragic scene of animals engaged in mutual self- torture and destruction in a light vein, with a representation of a peaceful bear cub who looks kindheartedly on the world and seems to express and confirm the optimism of life in general. By the left side of the same skeleton in grave #4 lay another iron knife with an ivory handle placed in a gold scabbard. The casing is covered on the sides with a fine geometric design with tur- quoise insets. The middle part is decorated with a scene of winged dragons in high relief. One of the dragons has caught the leg of the other in its amply toothed mouth. This piece is undoubtedly a tri- umph of ancient art: the fine modeling of the horned, scowling face of the dragon, the developed muscles of his tense body, and especially the clawed feet with their stretched sinews and liga- ments all vividly remind us of the traditions of Assyrian art. The heads of the sheep with their huge horns once again return us to Bactria where these proud creatures can still be found amid the mountain scenery of the rocky foothills of Hindu- kush. A particularly fine necklace was also found among the chest ornaments in this burial. It is composed of garnet and turquoise pendants lav- ishly covered with gold granules. ^A/e can go on describing and listing other preci- ous objects found in the 20,000-piece collection excavated in the Tillya-tepe graves - silver mir- rors with Chinese glyphs; mirrors with ivory han- dles; stones with engraved images of Greek god- desses and griffins; gold sew-on pendants with the image of Athena; pendants with horses; ivory combs with drawings of Begram-type people; large gold discs with encrustations; gold clips, some with May/June 1980 39</page><page sequence="10">(Left) A magnificent gold crown from the Tillya-tepe burials.

This piece is encrusted with turquoise. Length , 26 centimeters. sculptured cupids; medallions with busts - but enough has been described to attest to the impor- tance of the finds at Tillya-tepe. In addition to all of these marvelous gold objects, numerous coins have been found in the tombs: a silver Parthian coin of Mithridates II (123-88 b.c.) and a silver coin found in the mouth of the deceased in grave #6, a Parthian Phraates IV (38-2 b.c.). This last coin apparently had the seal preserved, showing Sapaleisis, one of the Yiieh-chih rulers who ruled in Bactria until the formation of the Kushan king- dom. A gold coin was held in the palm by the same deceased which was a local rendering of Parthian coins dating to the first century b.c. It too had a seal of one of the Yiieh-chih rulers who apparently recognized some sort of Parthian authority. Gold was very rarely used for coins during Parthian times, but two unique pieces were uncovered - a Roman gold aureus of the Emperor Tiberius (a.d. 16-21) and a gold Indian coin dating to the first century after Christ complete the numismatic in- ventory of the Tillya-tepe burials. Based on the coin evidence, the necropolis can be dated from the first century b.c. to the first century after Christ - the time when the Greco- Bactrian state was no longer in existence and the Kushan state had not yet become established. This little known period is poorly documented both in the written record as well as the archaeological data. After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 b.c., the Seleucid state began to form in the heart of Asia; it was followed by the Greco-Bac- trian empire where the ruling groups consisted of Hellenized Bactrians and Greek colonists. To a large extent the blending of these two cultures influenced the development of local culture for a long time. The Greco-Bactrian state itself lasted for a little over a century and fell under pressure of Yiieh-chih nomadic tribes who came to Middle Asia from regions in Central Asia and once lived adjacent to Mongolia. Under the pressure of the Huns they moved west, finally coming in contact with the enormous nomadic world of the steppes of Middle Asia - a world that spread from the Cas- pian Sea all the way east to Mongolia. By the middle of the second century b.c., this countless nomadic population was constantly moving south- ward into more fertile and prosperous land. Fi- nally reaching the Amu Darya River, the no- mads - among whom the Yiieh-chih played the leading role - toppled the Greco-Bactrian kingdom and settled into five principalities, each ruled by a prince. Judging by the ruins of the Greek city of Ai Khanoum, located on the right bank of the Amu Darya River, the conquerors moved forward leav- ing destruction in their path. Yesterday's nomads, no doubt lured by the advantages of a calm and secure city existence, slowly took up sedentary life. After more time, the Yiieh-chih founded the great empire of the Kushans. It is precisely this period that the excavations at Tillya-tepe illumi- nate and a number of observations can be made. The fact that females were buried with gold crowns attested to their high rank in life - a situa- tion characteristic only of nomadic peoples for this period. This high status of females so astounded the imagination of writers in antiquity that they noted it with great surprise; among the Scythians, women were often the rulers, for example, Queen Tamiris of Massagetia, and Zarina and Sparetra among the Sakas. According to the Greek histo- rian Ctesias, the Scythians buried not only their kings but their queens with grandiose ceremony, a fact confirmed to some extent by the Tillya-tepe tombs. While it is not yet proven, it seems likely that the Tillya-tepe necropolis belonged precisely to that Yiieh-chih ruling house which later founded the empire of the great Kushans. 40 Archaeology</page><page sequence="11">The predominance of Parthian coins as opposed to Greco-Bactrian coins shows that this was the period when maximum expansion of Parthia to the east took place, and when bordering Yiieh-chih territories were under her political influence, in- cluding the present-day province of Dzudzhan near the city of Shibergan. In this light, the amaz- ing similarity of gold ornaments at the Tillya-tepe necropolis to those of far off Nineveh is apparently not accidental. The artistic creations found at Tillya-tepe point to a high technical level of jew- elry making, but the frozen frontal compositions of the official dynastic art are far from the realistic and ebullient trends found in the local Hellenistic directed tendencies of the famed Greco-Bactrian art. Although many pieces depict gods of the Greek pantheon and even compositions from Greek mythology, their imperfect rendering attests to the superiority of predominantly local Bactrian artistry. This is especially evident in buckles cast in the shape of cupids sitting on fish. Apparently the local Bactrian jeweler only faintly remem- bered this widespread subject and substituted for the strange and incomprehensible dolphin more familiar images of local fish who lived in the Amu Darya River. By the same token, a Greek artisan would not have depicted Athena with the huge and unsightly large nose that appears on one of the gold rings. This blending of local, traditional Bactrian ideas with imagined, purely Greek ones is seen on many of the gold pieces, making it rather difficult at times to trace their origins. For example, the figures of winged goddesses seem to directly reflect the goddess Nike, but in the Bactrian inventory of the Bronze Age we find a similar deity, sometimes sitting on a throne, sometimes on a dragon. The lion with the sitting goddess depicted on the gold belt at first glance is associated with Cybele, how- ever on the same Bronze Age Bactrian seals there also appears a similiar composition: a winged god- dess sitting on top of an animal. In this case not only the iconography but also stylistic renderings are analogous - in both instances the animals are depicted with their heads turned back and their teeth bared. The crown with stylized trees and birds on the branches also shows very deep local traditions which arose in Bactrian mythology dur- ing the second millennium b.c. A separate theme can be found in the numer- ous zoomorphic images found at Tillya-tepe. They bear close analogy to the "Siberian animal style" in the art of the Sarmatian tribes. At first glance, it appears that these animal images are connected with the arrival of the nomads to Bactria and thereby attest to the great influence of nomad art. However, the very origin of the Scythian animal style is open to debate - some see it originating in Asia Minor, as evidence by the Sakkiz hoard, a collection of precious objects from northwestern Iran which some scholars view as the earliest ex- ample of the Scythian animal style. Others see it coming from Central Asia from the Arzhan burial mound in Tuva located in southern Siberia. It is sufficient at present to note that the form of twisted and bent animals on the gold pendants of Tillya-tepe find their prototypes in Kazakhstan and in the Altai region and not in Asia Minor. Finally, there is yet another aspect that emer- ges from the analysis of the anthropomorphic im- ages - one that possibly reflects the existence of a few ethnic physical types. The "ruler with dra- gons," the "goddess with cupid," and the "musi- cians-harpists" all present a recognizable physical type: faces with wide cheekbones, slanted eyes, willful chins, the Mongolianized features which possibly reflect the Yüeh-chih people. The excava- tions of the Tulkhar cemetery on the left bank of the Amu Darya River, in fact, revealed burials of unquestionably Mongoloid-featured individuals. A second physical type emerges from the depiction of the goddesses. One winged goddess has a moon- shaped oval face, wide-open eyes, and sensual wide lips. The same features are to be found on the goddess of fertility surrounded by birds, animals and fish as well as on the female busts on medal- lions. Finally, the gold fasteners shaped like war- riors without a doubt depict a classic Greek face, and perhaps are imports. Similar physical Greek types are also found on other objects, in particular on a sew-on pendant with bearded warriors. These foreign influences are augmented by im- ported Chinese mirrors and carved ivory from In- dia, all of which is not surprising if one takes into account the location of Tillya-tepe on the intersec- tion of the Great Silk Road: to the west is the Roman Empire, to the east Han China, and to the south lies India. For the first time after the discov- ery of the Amu Darya hoard and one from Begram, dating from the mid-second to mid-third century after Christ, we have again been fortunate enough to unearth a collection of ornaments which re- flected the glory of their world. When the last few days of the field season at Tillya-tepe drew near, glimmers of gold pendants were noticed under the shovels for the seventh time. Another burial, pos- sibly filled with gold, was peeking through the soil awaiting the careful investigations of the next field season. Foe Further Reading on ancient Central Asia: M. J.
