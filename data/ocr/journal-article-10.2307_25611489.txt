Reed University of Nebraska at Omaha ABSTRACT The pastoral and progressive traditions have played an integral role in shaping ideas about nature. Both traditions have contributed to an anti dualistic view of the relationship between nature and culture; however, the linguistic turn in political theory appears to limit our relationship to nature to that of a social construction. What has been lost in the social constructionistperspective is the idea of "agency" in nature that was an essential feature of identity, as captured in Hegel's synthesis of Aristotelian philosophy and Romantic expressivism. An environmental ethic that restores agency to nature justifies efforts to rehabilitate nature by supporting its capacity for self-healing. INTRODUCTION Ideas of nature have played an integral part in the development of environmental political theory in the United States. Two metaphors of nature?the machine and the garden?have formed a distinctively American ideology of space (Marx, 1991). Corresponding to these metaphors are two well-established traditions in political thought: The pastoral tradition, whose central figure is Henry David Thoreau, rebels against commercial and industrial society and calls for the simplification of life, tutored and informed by an appreciation and understanding of nature. The progressive tradition, whose central figure is Gifford Pinchot, emphasizes the wise technical administration of natural resources for the enhancement of material life and support of distributive justice. (B. P. Taylor, 1992, p. 4) As the following essay will argue, neither tradition is able to address the postmodern condition in which the boundary between the natural and artificial is irrevocably blurred (Borgmann, 1995). One alternative approach explored ?2001, Public Administration Theory Network</page><page sequence="2">40 Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis Vol. 23, No. 1 in this essay is to retrieve from Hegelian philosophy the original marriage between Aristotelian form and Romantic expressivism. Restoring a sense of agency to nature is an essential step in two respects: first, it is consistent with mounting evidence of cognition and expression in animals, as well as the self regulating capacity of biological systems (Dryzek, 1995). This evidence suggests that the scientific management of nature is anachronistic, and that new ways of understanding and respecting nature are now available to us. Second, restoring agency to the non-human world, that is, a sense of what is real in a hyper-modern culture that promotes virtual reality technologies (Borgmann, 1992), is an essential step in revitalizing public support for efforts to preserve what remains of an independent, wild nature. PASTORALISM: RECONSTRUCTING THE LANGUAGE OF NATURE The pastoral tradition called for a return to nature and "the simplification of life, tutored and informed by an appreciation and understanding of nature" (B. P. Taylor, 1992, p. 4). The pastoral tradition has been associated primarily with certain genres of nature writing, especially Thoreau, and landscape painting (Schneider, 1985; Smith, 1985). Though the field of environmental ethics represents many different philosophical approaches, the influence of the pastoral tradition is pervasive. A Sand County Almanac by Aldo Leopold (1949), considered by many to be the first major twentieth century contribution to environmental ethics, was written from a distinctly Thoreauvian vantage point while the author lived in a cabin on the edge of civilization, making daily excursions into, and detailed observations about, nature. A major legacy of both Thoreau and Leopold is the admonition against human manipulation of nature, even in the interests of conservation, because of the inevitable harm done to self-sustaining ecosystems. Many environmentalists today acknowledge the post-modern condition in which no self-regulating wild-life systems are left in the lower 48 states, making us caretakers of a managed world and responsible for all its life forms (Borgmann, 1995, p. 36); however, they seem paralyzed by the realization and deeply pessimistic about the future. As romantic naturalists and heirs to the pastoral tradition they are like Thoreau, who believed that wilderness was essential for human growth and value transformation. His forays into nature were a way for him to "experiment with self-forgetfulness, and thus with the dissolution of all cultural and civilized mental patterns" (Mclntosh, 1974, p. 53). Thoreau used metaphors from nature as a language of human transformation. Humans in a commercial society, he wrote, making the analogy to insect metamorphosis, were gross feeders in their larval state</page><page sequence="3">Reed 41 (Norton, 1991). The highest relationship was therefore an unmediated communion between the individual and the nonsocial realm of nature (Kateb, 1989). The importance of nature to the Romantic naturalist is reflected in the Emersonian idea of correspondence, "according to which nature and mind are thought to have essentially identical structures, and nature is a grand collection of metaphors for human actions and relations" (Mclntosh, 1974, p. 51). Transcendentalism thus carries on the view of a generation of German Romantic philosophers, particularly Schelling and Herder, that the creative life of nature and the creative power of thought are one. The importance of prose and poetry for the Romantic naturalist is precisely that language is the human medium of expression for the cosmic spirit that unfolds in nature and completes itself in conscious self-knowledge (C. Taylor, 1979, p. 10). It is not hard to understand why present-day heirs to this tradition are deeply pessimistic about the postmodern condition: No wilderness area in the Lower 48 states is a self-regulating wildlife system. The number of elk depends on the availability of winter forage, and the latter is often outside the wilderness boundaries or specially managed for feeding. Thus the number and the movement of the elk come to be determined by those areas that are set aside and secured for them. The composition of the elk herds as regards age and sex is determined by hunting regulations. Other species such as the fisher, the grizzly, and the wolf were once at home in the wilderness areas. In most cases it will depend on our policies whether or not they will once more be found there. (Borgmann, 1995, p. 34) The prospect of turning human consciousness?the vehicle of self expression for the cosmic spirit?into caretakers of a managed world (Borgmann, 1995, p. 36) is terribly depressing for many romantic naturalists. In contemporary environmental ethics, the debate over the merits of recovery and restoration efforts has led many to conclude that any efforts to manage nature would be "faking nature" (Elliot, 1997). As a set of principles to guide public administrators, however, this theory stream in environmental ethics is not especially helpful. Granted that anything restored by human effort becomes dependent on further (but not necessarily endless) effort, doing nothing might well exacerbate the situation and is unethical in a different sense, as a failure to care for what we have constructed: Although the outcome (of restoration) is broadly what human agency intended, it is still equivalent to what unimpeded nature would have produced. Besides, if there is intrinsic value in the fulfillment of the capacities of various natural creatures, each in accordance with its own nature, as I have argued elsewhere, then there is present the same intrinsic</page><page sequence="4">42 Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis Vol. 23, No. 1 value as there would have been if humanity had never intervened. Further, if the area was ever to regain this condition, nothing but the intervention of an intentional agency would bring this about. Indeed the paradox is perhaps no stronger than that involved when the agency and interventions of parents bring about the possibility of autonomy for their children as they grow to adulthood; though here autonomy is of course initiated rather than restored. (Attfield, 1994, p. 50) PROGRESSIVEM: CONSTRUCTING A GENERAL MIND As Vogel (1996, p. 5) points out, the question of nature's identity in German philosophy is bedeviled by a fundamental tension between two views, one that has its roots in Hegel's insistence "on the active role of the socially situated subject in constituting the field that subject inhabits;" while the other: has its roots not in Hegel but in Romantic and Lebensphilosophische traditions; for it, "nature" and more generally that which is Other than human or social take on a positive sign, and contemporary science and technology are criticized...because they violate the world's otherness, its specificity as an ontological realm beyond the human and not finally graspable by it. Thus, one answer to the dilemma posed by the postmodern condition is to view the world from the other, Hegelian, path in German philosophy, that is, to "see the relation of human subjects to the nature they inhabit as an active and world-changing one and.. .therefore to take seriously the idea of nature as a 'social category' or more precisely as something socially constructed'' (Vogel, 1996, p. 5). The implications of viewing nature as a social category are two-fold: on the one hand environmental ethics must necessarily encompass the built environment as well as "wild" nature; on the other hand, public administration theory must necessarily encompass human interactions with nature. In advocating an ethic of "the built world," Vogel rejects the idea that we can ever return to something like an original condition before human intervention. Thus while we may assume responsibility for what we have constructed, our goal cannot be the restoration of "nature" as an ontologically distinct realm. Paradoxically, however, our choice cannot be to "let nature takes it course" either, because doing nothing is tantamount to denying that we are responsible for what our social processes have produced. So our focus has to be on the human relationship with nature, and what our responsibility to care for what we have constructed might entail: Discourse about such a question would be discourse about what it would be good to build, what would make the world a better place, more</page><page sequence="5">Reed 43 beautiful and livable for its inhabitants (human and nonhuman both), and what would make us? the language users whose first sentence lights the world up and releases value into it?better people...We ask: "how can this be built?" And "what would it look like?" and "what would our lives be like in it?" and "how would it affect other entities in the world?" and "what would it do to the environment?" (p. 169) The argument that nature is a social category does not mean that it exists only in our imaginations, but rather that the environment inevitably bears the imprint of our constructions. Viewing nature in this way makes it more difficult to think of the landscape as the product of an autonomous market, something for which the public sector is not responsible. This perspective also rejects a "nature-in-itself' that defies attempts at human understandings but nevertheless issues imperatives for human morality. Quite the opposite: since human judgments are always already imbedded in the built environment and since they exercise objective constraints on what is possible, "ethical judgment about the value of nature needs to be linked to an awareness of the directions in which existing technologies and constructions are pushing us, independent of our intentions" (King, 2000, p. 116). This path in German philosophy has serious limitations that will be discussed at the end of this section; however, it does begin to address the role of public administration in caring for a "constructed nature." Unlike the Pastoral tradition that bore the imprint of German Romantic philosophy, the 19th century Progressive tradition reflected elements of Hegelian philosophy. As Cawley (1998) has pointed out, Pinchot's progressive principles of sustained yield forestry were standards of political morality to guide the application of new scientific management techniques. Moreover, according to Woodrow Wilson the role of the reformer/statesman was to discover and articulate for the public a "general mind," a common guiding spirit for politics (p. 61). In Hegelian fashion, the reformer/statesman would reconcile the dialectical opposition between reason and "nature" as expressed in the burgeoning logging, mining and ranching of wilderness areas, by assisting the country to recover its hidden identity as a unified nation in the American West. The key element of the "common script" from which Pinchot and Wilson were both working was to use principles as a context, connecting the public to natural resource managers, rather than isolating administrators from political influence. Moreover, Wilson's organic view of politics meant that the will of the state was discovered not on majoritarian grounds, but instead on the basis of historical and cultural events that had unified a nation. Thus, he looked to the new states of the West where immigrants from Europe did not identify with any natural political units, as had the settlers of the original thirteen</page><page sequence="6">44 Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis Vol. 23, No. 1 colonies. The West was a homogeneous region whose history reflected "the awakening of the national spirit into full consciousness" (Rohr, 1986, p. 64). For these Progressives, then, nature was not an autonomous sphere but an integral part of the history of the state and the construction of a general mind. There are serious limitations in adopting this view today. Granted, the principles of Pinchot and Wilson helped to re-frame public discourse in a new industrial context and to link the organization of participation to new administrative techniques of conservation. In addition, the progressive vision emphasized the reconciliation of interest groups competing for access to federal land by policies of inclusiveness. "However, our move to a more inclusive politics made the task of excluding timber production, and consequently timber producers, from the discourse more difficult, if not impossible" (Cawley, 1998, p. 63). Now, in the context of a post-industrial society, the social constructionist perspective is even more susceptible to exploitation by those who act as if "the natural world as described by scientists and conservationists, if it exists, (is) a human artifact produced by our economic activities, and as such is grist for further material reshaping" (Soule &amp; Lease, 1995, p. xv). In the post-industrial context, then, nature has become literally (and only) a construction, suggesting that it is the objective result of discrete physical manipulations. Furthermore, in the absence of a common guiding spirit, democratic control of technology in the sense intended by progressive reformers is not possible. Ironically, the social constructionist perspective of the Progressive vision transcended the opposition between nature and spirit. Moreover, its view of nature as a social category connected the American people to their land. At a time when public opinion is susceptible to the glittering hyper-reality of post-industrial technologies, however, it seems unlikely that the democratic process will embrace an environmental ethic that assumes responsibility for what has been socially constructed. As Borgmann (1992) has pointed out: Even if the government were not implicated in the construction of the tangible order of things, it would constitute the obvious instrument for a free people to assert its will if it is dissatisfied with the shape the physical environment is assuming. The failure of people and parties to take clear and vigorous responsibility for the order of things indicates the absence of any profound disagreement with the tangible character of contemporary life. Yet it would be hasty to infer general approval from the lack of patent discontent. Between wholehearted approval and strenuous objection lies something like implication in a course of events, the half-knowing and half-hearted going along and even pushing ahead with a certain sense of development, (p.l 15)</page><page sequence="7">Reed 45 The problem here is that nature as a social category?as the "built environment" (Vogel, 1996)?has not only been constructed in the sense of being connected to a common guiding spirit, but has also been absorbed into human culture. "Rather than being viewed as a multifaceted, diverse order whose patterns and possibilities extend well beyond our ability to understand them, nature becomes an offshoot of social reality which also constructs individuality" (Kidner, 2000, p. 341). Ironically, the Progressive tradition that had its roots in the Hegelian view of nature as socially constructed had the potential to inspire an environmental ethic of care. This philosophical path seems to have digressed into a thoroughly human-centered view of nature, not as the locus of our hidden cultural identity but instead as the beneficiary of human cultural constructions. Such unremitting anthropocentrism is not Hegelian in its origins. As C. Taylor (1979) points out: Hegel's expressive theory does not see the hiatus between life and consciousness which we find in Cartesian-empiricist dualism. For the latter, the vital functions are relegated to the world of extended, material being, and are to be understood mechanistically; while the functions of mind belong to a separate, non-material entity. Hence Descartes could look on animals as complicated machines. But for any follower of Aristotle, this kind of dichotomy is untenable. For a living thing is a functioning unity and not just a concatenation of parts. Moreover, in maintaining a certain form through changing conditions it shows a sort of proto-purpose, and even a proto-intelligence in adapting to novel circumstances, akin to what self-conscious beings show in explicit form in their striving for goals and their ability to take account of self and surroundings in doing so. The living thing is, in other words, not just a functioning unity, but also something in the nature of an agent; and this places it in a line of development which reaches its apex in the human subject, (p. 19) In other words, what has been lost in the social constructionist perspective is the Aristotelian idea of agency, or the relation of matter and form, that was an essential part of Hegel's theory of the subject (C. Taylor, p. 18). What remains is the view that expression is embodied in language; however, if the only medium of expression is human (i.e., language) then only human constructions count in the process of self-recognition. Thus, the ethic of the built environment in Vogel's quasi-Hegelian approach does not provide guiding principles for the recovery or restoration of nature at all. Quite the contrary, it counsels against restoration techniques based on "what unimpeded nature would have produced" as a guide for human intervention (Attfield, p. 50). Rejecting the idea of agency in all living things, so much a part of Hegelian philosophy, has left us with human language as the only "vehicle</page><page sequence="8">46 Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis Vol. 23, No. 1 whereby the cosmic spirit brings to completion a self-expression the first attempts at which lie before us in nature." (C. Taylor, 1979, p. 10) POSTMODERN BIOLOGY: RESTORING AGENCY TO NATURE Both the Pastoral and Progressive traditions were anti-dualistic in their views of the relationship between nature and culture. According to those traditions, then, nature was not something "out there" in a separate ontological realm. Having overcome the opposition between matter and spirit characteristic of Enlightenment philosophy, however, the "linguistic turn" in philosophy has now resulted in a divorce in the marriage between Aristotelian and Romantic philosophy: Hegel's conception builds on the expressivist theory, which was developed by Herder and others. As we saw, this brought back Aristotelian categories in which we see the subject, man, as realizing a certain form; but it also added another dimension in that it looks on this realized form as the expression, in the sense of clarification, of what the subject is, something which could not be known in advance. It is the marriage of these two models, of Aristotelian form and modern expression, which enables us to speak here of ^//-realization. (C. Taylor, p. 16) As Harlow (1992) points out, "in the Aristotelian world, full conscious subjectivity shades off into unconscious teleology, in such a way that even the lowliest forms of life or, for that matter, such elements as fire are still subjects, still active insofar as they have, and seek to perfect, form" (p. 34). Hume reduced agency in nature to an "anthropomorphic projection, a feeling in the mind rather than the description of something independent of the mind" (p. 36). Although Hegel restored the sense of continuity of living things (from Aristotle), adding the view (from the Romantics) that thought is inseparable from its medium, the social constructionist view has severed Aristotelian nature from the idealism of Romantic thought. If nature is only a social construction, then it has become a Humean projection by default, so to speak, "grist for further material reshaping," as Soule and Lease put it (1995, p. xv). Recognizing agency in nature is essential to the postmodern project of supporting nature as a world constituted by self-determining organisms capable of responding to opportunities provided by humans for healing and regeneration. There is mounting evidence from postmodern biology that animals think and are capable of embodied expression (Griffin, 1994; Midgley, 1983; Shepard, 1998). Perhaps instead of labeling efforts to care for the world that we have constructed as "restoration," a term that encompasses the material reshaping of nature, we ought to be talking about "restoring</page><page sequence="9">Reed 47 agency to nature." A different way of knowing the world is implied here: we recognize our constructions of the world as situated not only in history and culture, but also in our positions as human beings whose representations are privileged but do not constitute the full range of constructions available to us (Hayles, 1995). Thus, respect for nature's agency has important implications for public administration theory and practice. Respecting nature's agency raises important questions of appropriate scale in decision processes. As Dryzek (1995) argues, "the feedback processes which organize, regulate, and maintain natural systems are of a diffuse and internal type?signals do not pass through any central thermostat analog." For that reason, "we should be wary of highly centralized decision mechanisms?national environmental bureaucracies, multinational mining or logging corporations, international resource management agencies and so forth?which could dominate, ignore, or suppress local ecological signals" (p. 112). Although problems like global climate change and ozone depletion require a worldwide political response, these are exceptions to the principle of small-scale organization. The tendency of economic institutions to extend their operations to "pollution havens" in Third World countries is the most obvious example of why it is essential "that diffuse decision processes in the natural world should be matched by diffuse decision processes in human societies" (p. 112). CONCLUSION: RESPECT FOR NATURE'S AGENCY If, as B. P. Taylor (1992) argues, environmental political thought in the U.S. can be reduced to two major visions?the Pastoral and the Progressive?then the role of public administration in healing the ravages of the industrial revolution will be limited at best. There is reason for hope, however, because certain issues and trends have emerged in environmental and natural resource management that are compatible with respect for agency in nature. Recent case studies of "civic environmentalism," for example, illustrate the trend toward new, community-based, models of environmental governance to manage pervasive, non-point source water pollution from agricultural run-off into streams and lakes; control solid waste and its disposal; conserve electricity; and begin the lengthy process of healing the Everglades (John, 1994). Similarly, the use of alternative dispute resolution by the U.S. Forest Service to build local consensus for land management plans has meant their having to compromise long-standing professional norms of autonomy and centralized resource management articulated by Pinchot (Manring, 1993).</page><page sequence="10">48 Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis Vol. 23, No. 1 These trends are encouraging, for they introduce a more appropriate scale of decision-making into environmental and natural resource management, but they are not enough to ensure respect for nature's agency. It is entirely possible that post-industrial local, market-based policy instruments (economic incentives to limit pollution as well as logging and mining) will be the future drivers of environmental and natural resource management. In fact, "sustainable development" is based on the idea that local economic development is compatible with conservation management. An environmental ethic based on respect for nature's agency is required to guide decision making in the future: Under this [bio-centric] conception of individual living things, each is seen to have a unique point of view. This point of view is determined by the organism's particular way of responding to its environment, interacting with other individual organisms, and undergoing the regular, law-like transformations of the various stages of its species-specific life cycle. As it sustains its existence through time, it exemplifies all the functions and activities of its species in its own peculiar manner. When observed in detail, its way of existing is seen to be different from that of any other organism, including those of its species. To be aware of it not only as a center of life, but as the particular center of life that it is, is to be aware of its uniqueness and individuality. The organism is the individual it is precisely in virtue of its having its own idiosyncratic manner of carrying on its existence in the (not necessarily conscious) pursuit of its good. (P. Taylor, 1986, p. 122-123) The recognition of organisms in nature as "teleological centers of life"?as having agency in the Aristotelian sense of the term?provides the basis for an environmental ethic that restores agency to nature. One version of such an ethic is exemplified by Paul Taylor's Respect for Nature (1986): 1. The Principle of Self-Defense: It is permissible for humans (as moral agents) to protect themselves against dangerous or harmful organisms by destroying them (p. 264). 2. The Principle of Proportionality: In a conflict between human values and the good of (harmless) wild animals and plants, greater weight is to be given to basic than to nonbasic interests, no matter what the species, human or other, the competing claims arise from (p. 278). 3. The Principle of Minimum Wrong: When rational, informed, and autonomous persons who have adopted the attitude of respect for nature are nevertheless unwilling to forgo [certain human interests that lie at the center of the total conception of an individual's own</page><page sequence="11">Reed 49 true good], it is permissible for them to pursue those values only so long as doing so involves fewer wrongs than any alternative way of pursuing those values (p. 282- 283). 4. The Principle of Distributive Justice: When the interests of the parties (human and non-(human) are all basic ones and there exists a natural source of good that can be used for the benefit of any of the parties, each party must be allotted an equal share (p. 292). 5. The Principle of Restitutive Justice: When the method of distribution does not result in equal treatment to all organisms, we owe some measure of reparation or compensation to wild creatures as their due (p. 292). Respecting nature in the sense outlined above avoids the difficulties associated with the social constructionist approach discussed earlier: the emphasis on the social construction as (human) linguistic expression alone and the disregard for agency in nature has meant that all constructions carry equal moral weight in the political arena, the shopping mall as well as the art museum. It is not that "nature" is providing us a moral guide here, as in the Pastoral tradition, but rather that the limiting tendencies of the social constructionist approach are replaced by a perspective that expands that perspective to include "all teleological centers of life" (P. Taylor, p. 121) as capable of self-expression. Furthermore, we are capable of interpreting those expressions by practicing "an essentially hermeneutic biology involving imaginative attempts to reconstruct the actions-in-context of other thinking beings" (Dryzek, 1995, p. 110). What this means for public administration theory and practice is that it is possible to move beyond the Progressive principles of natural resource management without abandoning a scientific understanding of the non-human world in favor of "post-progressive" market-based policies. Local, small-scale decision-making is possible because science itself has moved beyond positivism in the field of biology, particularly cognitive ethology, the unification of behavioral ecology and the philosophy of mind. The mounting evidence for Aristotle's notion of agency in nature, as found in postmodern biology, makes the traditional dichotomy between public discourse about (human) values and the scientific management of (non-human) resources anachronistic and increasingly hard to justify. Restoring agency to nature would not only enhance our understanding of the non-human world and how to support its capacity for self-healing; it would also help the human public to discern what still counts in a world where the boundary between reality and virtual, or hyper-reality, has become</page><page sequence="12">50 Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis Vol. 23, No. 1 irrevocably blurred. As Borgmann (1992) argues, "Commanding presence, continuity with the world, and centering power" are signs of what is real. Hyper-reality, on the other hand, has an "insubstantial and disconnected glamour (that) provokes disorientation and distraction, which are both precariously poised between sullen resentment and hyperactive exertion" (p. 96): To bring out the contrast between these symmetries is a task that is at once ontological, moral, aesthetic, theological, and political. It is ontological in raising the problem of what is real. It is moral in directing us to the very substance of human conduct. It is aesthetic as it involves us in the question of what human works are centrally enchanting and illuminating. It is theological because it leads us to the issues of grace and divinity. And it must become political and make us consider our responsibility for the common order. Either we see this task in all of its dimensions or we will miss it altogether.
