<plain_text><page sequence="1">FURTHER LIGHT ON SIR RICHARD WINSTEDT'S ' UNDESCRIBED MALAY VERSION OF THE RAMAYANA ' By E. C. G. BARRETT The Hikayat Se'ri Rama (HSR) is a literary version in Malay of the Rama story-a long, comprehensive, and basically Hindu prose narration with a few Islamic adjustments here and there. It seems to have been written in approxi- mately the form known to us, or adapted to that form,1 soon after the coming of Islam to the Malay world,2 and it has survived in many differing manuscripts telling essentially the same basic story, or part of the same basic story. Successive descriptions of manuscripts have tended to explain more and more of the particularly unislamic beginning of the saga, which seems to have been deliberately omitted for religious reasons by many copyists. In 1843 Roorda van Eysinga published the text of a HSR manuscript 3 which starts with events leading up to the birth of Rama.4 In 1891 a description of a Batavia manuscript by Gerth van Wijk,5 and, in 1899, a description of a Leiden manuscript by H. H. Juynboll 6 showed that the story went back at least to the birth of Ravana. In 1915 W. G. Shellabear published the text of a manuscript which does not go back quite so far as the birth of Ravana but starts abruptly at the point where he begins his asceticism with a view to obtaining a boon.' We are thus given a text starting 51 printed pages before the beginning of Roorda's. This manuscript is interesting because of its antiquity,8 but it presents, nevertheless, what is clearly a later recension than Roorda's.9 1 The oldest MS extant dates from the beginning of the seventeenth century but is a com- paratively late recension (see this page, n. 8-9). 2 The term 'Malay world', as here used, is a translation of alam Melayu. By this is meant the areas in the Malay Peninsula and Archipelago where the Malay language was used-but not necessarily by the majority of the population. It therefore includes certain trading ports in Java, Acheh, etc., as well as places such as Malacca. Conversion of Malay governments to Islam was largely effected between the beginning of the fourteenth and the end of the sixteenth centuries. There is reason to believe that the missionaries were pantheistic Sfiffs (see A. H. Johns, ' Sufism as a category in Indonesian literature and history', Journal of SE Asian History, II, 2, 1961, 10-23). 3 Geschiedenis van Sri Rama, beroemd Indisch heroisch dichtstuk, Amsterdam, 173 pp. There is a romanized and simplified version of this-Hikajat Seri Rama, first published by the Balai Poestaka at Batavia in 1938 (256 pp.). 4 The Marsden MS (No. 12902) in the Library of SOAS also starts at this point-so do Leiden Codex 3248 and Royal Batavia Society MSS 136 and 152. Other MSS start at an even later stage. 56 Iets over verschillende Maleische Redactiln van den Seri Rama ', Tijdschrift voor Indische Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, xxxIv. 6 Catalogus van de Maleische en Sundaneesche handschriften der Leidsche Universiteits Biblio- theek, Leiden, p. 47 et seq. ' Hikayat Seri Rama ', Journal of the Straits Branch, Royal Asiatic Society, No. 71, 285 pp. A romanized version was published in 1957 by the Malayan Education Department (355 pp.). 8 The MS was given by Archbishop Laud to the Bodleian Library in 1633. It would appear to have been brought to England soon after 1612 by an English sea-captain whose permit to trade in Acheh is also included in Laud's bequest to the library (see Shellabear, 'An account of some of the oldest Malay MSS now extant', JSBRAS, No. 31, 1898, 107-51). 9 See Zieseniss, Die Rdma-Sage, Hamburg, 1928, 113-14.</page><page sequence="2">532 E. C. G. BARRETT W. F. Stutterheim in 1925,1 and, to a greater extent, A. Zieseniss in 1928 2 analysed very fully the story of the Hikayat Sari Rama, as told in the two published texts, and pointed to various Indian sources for nearly the whole saga. In 1933, H. Overbeck described a Berlin manuscript which again started with the birth of Ravana.3 In all these versions the story that Rama is an incarnation of Visnu and Ravana an incarnation of some other supernatural being has been avoided by Muslim copyists, with varying degrees of effectiveness. No further addition was made to the beginning of the-Malay saga until Sir Richard Winstedt in 1944 published an article entitled 'An undescribed Malay version of the Ramayana ',4 in which he deals with 'Raffles Malay Manuscript no. 22 ', belonging to the Library of the Royal Asiatic Society. Sir Richard shows that the story in this manuscript starts at a point 32 pages anterior to Shellabear's (and about 13 pages anterior to the start of the manu- scripts described by Gerth van Wijk, Juynboll, and Overbeck). He writes: 'The story starts abruptly and apparently in the middle of a narrative. " This is the tale of si-Ranchak 5 how he was hunting, and when he met ..., he said, ' G.r.ndi.vamma (L4j C50*) and Sura M.nak.h (&amp;AS'. \L ), I si-Ranchak am your relative and I have come in quest of you '." They ask him why his golden skin and moon-fair face are now half white and half black and why his ten heads have lost their crowns ... '. Siranchak, who, as it later appears, is Ravana in a previous life, does not, in the Raffles manuscript, answer this awkward question and we are left guessing what character in Hindu mythology he can represent and what has happened to him before the manuscript begins. Light has now been thrown on these questions by another undescribed HSR manuscript which takes the story back a further 14 pages. This manu- script, Cambridge University Library Add. 3756, was presented by a friend of Sir Richard's youth, the Malay scholar R. J. Wilkinson, in November 1900.6 It is 604 pages long and the copyist has noted on the last page that it was completed at 1 p.m. on 13 June 1892 at 327 North Bridge Road 7 (a main street of Singapore) by Sergeant-Major Muhammad Tahir bin tnche' Nor Din, and 1 Rama-Legenden und Rama-Reliefs in Indonesien, Munich, Georg Miiller Verlag. 2 Die Rama-Sage bei den Malaien, ihre Herkunft und Gestaltung, Hamburg, Friedrichsen, de Gruyter.

Now comes what appears, for reasons that will manifest themselves later, to be another broken beginning 5 to the saga : '(Wilkinson, p. 1) He saw an enchanting woman and the light of her countenance was radiant. Siranchak was overcome by lust and quickly seized her hand, but the princess disappeared from his sight. Siranchak was amazed and thought to himself: " Whither can she have run ? " Then he realized that the woman had been Mahabisnu who had assumed this shape in order to test him. Siranchak was angry (W, 2) and thwarted in love and ashamed of what he had done. He said to himself : " Look at Mahabisnu. He wishes to humiliate me and certainly he will make war on me ". Then he thought: " It were well that I fight him nevertheless for I wish to descend into the World ". Then he quickly went to a lonely place to practise asceticism in order to ask Dewata Mulia Raya 6 for magical power to help him in his war against Mahabisnu.' 1 The identity of this family and the exact meaning of the sentence quoted require further investigation. 2 Sa-orang dewa-dewa. 3 Etymologically the ' Abode of Indra ' but usually regarded by latter-day Malays as merely a fairyland. Later in the HSR the word kUinderaan is used to mean one of the four (not three) divisions of the universe-the one located in the sky. In the present passage the copyist seems to have in mind a heaven inhabited by gods inferior to those inhabiting the Heaven of the Highest Gods (Keyangan) so 'Indra's Heaven ' would be an adequate translation here. 4 Here spelt ., but elsewhere always 4..J or ". As will be seen later, Siranchak is, or is soon to become a raksasa, and he has a raksasa brother called Girandiwama (see p. 537, n. 6). He is later to be reborn as Rawana, and Girandiwama as Rawana's brother, Kumbakarna. As Father Camille Bulcke, author of Rama-kath&amp;, Allahabad, 1950, has pointed out in a letter, Siranchak appears to be Hiranyaka'ipu (a name sometimes abbreviated in India to 'Hiranyaka ') and his brother, Hirainyyka. According to the late story in the Bhigavata-purana, vii, i, 35-46 (c. thirteenth century ?), Visinu had two gate-keepers, Jaya and Vijaya, who were cursed by Sanaka and his brothers to be born three times as demons; the first time as Hiranyaka'ipu and Hirainydka, the second time as Rdvana and Kumbhakarna, and the third time as SisupRla and Dantavaktra. 5 The reasons are (a) that no mention is made here of the fact that Siranchak is in the act of abducting a nymph whom Mahabisnu (i.e. Visnu) wishes to free; (b) that clearly the antagonism between Siranchak and Mahabisnu is of long standing, and (c) that Girandiwama and his sister are later introduced to the reader as if already known to him. It would be idle to hazard what the still missing part of the beginning of the HSR can have contained but it may have been akin to: (a) the Indian stories of Hirariyaka'ipu obtaining from giva the sovereignty of the three Worlds and persecuting his son Prahlada for worshipping Vionu; and of Hiranyiiksa dragging the earth to the depths of the ocean; and (b) the Javanese story of Watu Gunung, King of Inderapuri who, like Hiranyaka'ipu, is a previous incarnation of Rivan.a and is defeated by Visu. 6 Wilkinson's Malay-English dictionary defines this as: 'The Deity All-glorious and Almighty: the God of non-Moslem heroes of romance '. On the fourteenth-century Trengganu Stone this hybrid Sanskrit expression is used for the God of the Muslims (see H. S. Paterson, 'An early Malay inscription from Trengganu', JMBRAS, 11, 3, 1924, 252-8) and it seems</page><page sequence="4">534 E. C. G. BARRETT Meanwhile Mahabisnu had resumed his normal form and returned to K yangan,l where he was greeted by a god called Paratusura 2 who said: 'Whence comes my lord ? ' Mahabisnu stopped for a moment and then said: ' I have gone to test Siranchak. When I met him he said: " Whither goes my lady ? " I replied: " I travel alone from city to city and amuse myself. That is all that I do ". (W, 3) Then Siranchak said: " 0 Princess, do you desire me ? " I replied " If you desire me, quickly return that woman,3 that you may obtain me ". Then Siranchak saw that the nymph he was carrying had become an old woman. He quickly dropped her and ran to catch my hand. But I disappeared from his sight. Then he ran away ashamed. That is how the nymph came to escape from Siranchak's hands.' Then Paratusura smiled and said : ' Do, My Lord, that which you have just described-take the form of a beautiful woman and dance as you danced before Siranchak '. Then Mahabisnu took the form of a woman matchless in the Jagat Buana 4 and danced before Paratusura. Paratusura experienced an effusio seminis. The manikam was received by Mahabisnu 5 and he wrapped it in a segandamala leaf. Then he called Raja Bayu 6 and said: 'O Raja Bayu, quickly take this manikam and put it into the mouth of a woman who is practising asceticism in the Encircling Sea.' Her mouth is gaping for she has been practising asceticism for a thousand years standing on a needle. (W, 4) The woman's name is Dewi Anjani,8 daughter of Mayasi (?) '.9 Then Raja Bayu did obeisance and glided downwards with the manikam. probable that it was the first term so used by the early missionaries to the Malay world, who explained Muslim concepts in Hindu terms. Later, when the expression Allah taala came into current use, the expression Dewata Mulia Raya seems to have come to be used only for the God of non-Muslim heroes of romance-possibly essentially the same God as Allah taala but belonging to a period before the successive Muslim Prophets revealed Him fully. In the HSR which seems to have been conceived by its first Muslim adapter as belonging to the period of revelation of the Prophet Adam, Dewata Mulia Raya is set far above Brahmd, Vi.n?u, and Siva who duly pray to Him. 1 The 'Abode of the Yang (Highest Gods) '. 2 ~y4 . As Dr. C. Hooykaas points out, it seems probable that this is a corruption of 'Paramaisura' (i.e. a Malay form of ParameAvara, one of the names of giva), for giva (later called by his more usual Malay name Betara Guru) is clearly intended. Father Bulcke, in a letter, points out that, in the Siva-mahdpurn.a, Siva sees Viniu in the form of Mohini 'the Charmer' and experiences an effusio seminis ; the Sages drop the semen into the ear of AfijanA, who later gives birth to Hanuman. It will be seen that the Malay story to follow is very similar. 3 The lady Siranchak is in the act of abducting may well be Dewi Seri (gri), wife of Mahabisnu, who is much chased by Rawana in the Javanese Serat kanda ning ringgit purwa (Stutterheim, op. cit., ch. iii). 4 Two very literary words of Sanskrit origin (jagat, bhuvana) evidently juxtaposed to indicate ' the Universe'. 5 The passage that follows is the same as on Raffles, 197, but there it is Mahabisnu himself and not Betara Guru (or Paratusura) who becomes the father of Dewi Anjani's child, Hanoman. It is also the same as in Roorda and in Shellabear, but, in both those manuscripts, the incident is stated to take place later and S~ri Rama is the father (albeit, in Shellabear, he is temporarily in the form of a monkey). It is not clear why, in the Wilkinson MS. the birth of Hanoman is brought in so early. 6 In Vdlmfki and other Indian versions V~yu is the actual father of Hanuman. 7 Laut Se'mpadan.

Then Dewi Anjani regained consciousness, returned home and practised asceticism no more. Meanwhile, Siranchak frightens an assembly of maharisis and brahmins 1 who run to Betara Berahma 2 for help. They say that a raksasa ' originating from' (asal-nya daripada) Siranchak 3 has disturbed them. He is likely to cause particular trouble to one Begawan Bisparupan 4 as the latter has seven good-looking wives and has stayed behind in the jungle. (W, 5) Three of the maharisis, after failing to persuade Bisparupan to come with them, go on their way but hear Betara Ludri travelling 'like a typhoon ',5 think it is Siranchak, and run away. Then they see it is only their friend Betara Ludri. (W, 6) They greet him and go on to find Betara Berahma. Meanwhile Begawan Bisparupan, in order to hide his wives from Siranchak, hollows out seven trees, fits each with a door with an internal bolt, and puts a wife into each. Every night the begawan visits one of his wives. He knocks on the door and is let in. Then he bolts the door behind him and sleeps with the wife in question. Before daybreak he departs and the wife bolts herself in again. Siranchak watches this unobserved (W, 7) and then starts to knock on each door in turn after the bigawan has left. In the dark he successfully persuades each wife that he is the begawan who has returned to sleep with her a second time. It is not until the eighth day (W, 8) that the begawan realizes what has been happening. He then discovers that all his wives have become pregnant by Siranchak, extracts the embryo in each case, and throws it away. Betara Ludri sees all this and goes to Keyangan to tell Mahabisnu. (W, 9) Mahabisnu says: 'I had better kill Siranchak'. Betara Ludri obtains per- mission to accompany him ' to see the show'. Mahabisnu's ' Golden Peacock' 6 carries him to a certain forest where he catches Siranchak in the act of entering a tree containing one of Begawan Bisparupan's wives. A fight follows in which mountains are hurled around. Finally Mahabisnu fells Siranchak with a blow of his sword. As Siranchak lies on the ground (W, 10) Mahabisnu presses him with his great toe 7 and he falls to below the seven patala (*) under the Earth. Mahabisnu now returns to Keyangan and sends Betara Ludri to tell the maharisi, 1 In the Indian stories it is usually the gods of Indra's Heaven who are frightened by Rivana. In the HSR it is usually maharisi and other ascetics. Since Hindu terminology was used in the early days of Islam in the Malay world to denote Muslim concepts, it is possible that the adapter of the saga used such words as maharisi to mean S-ifi. 2 Brahmi. 3 Presumably Siranchak has taken on a new form. 4 Bisparupan: twice spelt ,bi). but later always Z jI..!.. A Malay name evidently derived from Vi'varilpa. After his unfortunate experiences with his seven wives, Bisparupan is to be reborn into the world as Maharisi Kisuberisu in order to help Seri Rama combat Rawana. While in the world, he curses Rawana when he is abducting Mandudari. He also begets the monstrous birds JEntayu, Sampati, and Garuda Mahabiru, all of whom also help Seri Rama. He is evidently the same as Kagyapa in the Indian legends who had 13 wives and by them begat demons, nagas, reptiles, and birds, including Garuda.

Rivana praises Siva for a thousand years, after which time giva releases him.</page><page sequence="6">536 E. C. G. BARRETT muni, dewa zanggi,' jogi, and berahmana that they can return to their jungle orchards in peace. When Betara Ludri arrives in Keyangan after accomplishing his mission, he finds Mahabisnu and Betara Guru sitting in state surrounded by indera-indera and dewa-dewa.2 Mahabisnu is calling for volunteers to descend to Earth. He says that Siranchak will practise asceticism for twelve years to re-equip himself for a fight. He himself proposes to be aided by thirty-three score 3 of dewa zanggi, who will be his captains; by a naga called Puspa Pertala Seganda Dewa, who will turn himself into magic arrows 4; (W, 11) by the Golden Peacock, who will be reincarnated as his wife 5; and by Sangsurama (?) 6 who will become his brother. His steed will be one of Begawan Bisparupan's sons, Gurda (i.e. Garuda) Mahabiru (j  .e ). Mahabisnu now mounts the Golden Peacock. He tells the thirty-three score of dewa zanggi (who have presumably by this time volunteered to help him) to descend to Earth and practise asceticism in preparation for the coming war. He plays with some lotus flowers and they turn into Naga Puspa Pertala 1 This expression seems to be peculiar to the HSR and to be used there only to designate supernatural beings that descend into the world to help Mahabisnu against Rawana. A Sanskrit derivation for the word zanggi (usually 3 .j ; far less frequently ($Z danggi; twice - on Raffles, 147, and once - on Raffles, 718) is to be expected but I have not been able to trace one. At its face value zanggi would appear to mean 'belonging to the land of Zanj ' on the East Coast of Africa, and it is possible that the beings in question are conceived as coming from beyond the ' Encircling Sea '. It is also just possible that the word is an orthographic corruption of rijal (vide the spellings J.- and ;- given above) and that the first Muslim adapter of the Hindu saga (who was probably a Sfifi) had the rijdl-al-ghaib-the ' Hidden Ones ' of the Sfifis- in mind (' the world is supposed to endure, thanks to the intercessions of a concerted hierarchy of " averting " saints, fixed in number . . . ', Encyclopaedia of Islam, s.v. Tasawwuf, ? 5b). Another possibility is derivation from the word janggi ' warrior ' of Persian origin. 2 This council of the gods occurs also in Vdlmiki, I, xv. 3 The figure 33 has presumably been taken from the original number of the Hindu gods. In Vdlmiki, I, xvi, 7-8, the gods 'caused warriors to be born in the monkey tribe from the wombs of countless celestial beings' (Hari Prasad Shastri (tr.), The Ramayana of Valmiki, London, 1952). 4 1. .3  S .j LL.,. Clearly the same as Visuki or Sega but his future role has been changed from that of Lakemana (as is to be expected from late Indian stories) to that of Rama's weapons. The Javanese Serat kanda story (Stutterheim, 74-5) follows the Indian version: Vi.nu and the naga (called ' Basuki ' and elsewhere ' Pratala Naga ') are incarnated as the sons of Dagaratha. The naga's name brings to mind naga puspa-a traditional dragon motif on batik cloth (vide Wilkinson's dictionary, p. 160). 5 In other words the Golden Peacock (Garudra ?) is to be reincarnated as SitA, a concept which Father Bulcke assures me is entirely absent from any Indian version of the Ramayana. Nevertheless the idea is continuously worked out in the Wilkinson, Raffles, and Roorda MSS of the HSR, both in the passages dealt with in the present article and in the better-known part of the Hikayat (where, however, direct mention of the reincarnation of Mahabisnu and his companions in the story of Rama's birth has been suppressed, evidently for religious reasons). It is clear that, in the original version of the Malay (or Javanese) story, it is Dewi Seri (i.e. Sri) and not a Golden Peacock, who is to be reincarnated as Sita Dewi. The Javanese Serat kanda story, described elsewhere, confirms this. 6 1.bJ (= Paragurdma ?). This name is not used again, as Mahabisnu is to rename his companion ' Kisna Dewa ' (= Kr*na ?). As pointed out in n. 4, above, it is surprising that it is not the naga who is destined in the HSR for the role of Laksamana. As mentioned on p. 541, n. 5, however, there seems to be an Indian precedent for the incarnation of Kr.na as Lakqmana.</page><page sequence="7">FURTHER LIGHT ON WINSTEDT'S 'MALAY VERSION OF RAMAYANA' 537 Sgganda Dewa. Then he tells the Golden Peacock to fly him to Earth. The Peacock replies that he (she ?) has been his steed for several thousand years and now wants a new role-to become the most honourable of all the dewa zanggi-his terrestrial wife. Mahabisnu agrees to this and adds that it will be the Peacock who will start the war.1 (W, 12) The Peacock now happily carries him to a jungle orchard on Earth called Ind'rapikrama.2 On arrival there, Mahabisnu tells the naga and the Golden Peacock that, since Siranchak is to practise asceticism for twelve years, they had better do so for twenty. Mahabisnu now prays to Dewata Mulia Raya for a brother and companion. Immediately a champaka flower becomes a very handsome man of the colour of gold. Mahabisnu names him ' Kisna Dewa ' 3 and says : ' We two are to be brothers reincarnated to the family of a great king'. Mahabisnu and Kisna Dewa now join the naga and the peacock in the practice of asceticism. Meanwhile Siranchak is below the seven patala under the Earth-weeping. (W, 13) He rallies and starts to dream of revenge. Then he cuts off one of his ten heads and converts the skull into the body of a viol. Then he cuts off three of his fingers and converts them into pegs for the strings. Then he cuts off an arm and converts it into the neck of the viol. Then he ties the whole together with his hair and cuts out tendons from his arm to form the strings. Then he plays his new viol in honour of Dewata Mulia Raya-very sweetly-for twelve years. At the end of this period a Voice 4 is heard saying : ' What wishest thou, Siranchak, that thou behavest thus ? ' Siranchak asks merely that he be allowed to ascend into the World, and this request is immediately granted. Having arrived in the World, Siranchak looks for his two brothers and his sister (W, 14) with a view to being reincarnated with them to the family of King B6ramaraja.5 Meanwhile one of his brothers, Girandiwama, and his sister, Sura M.nak.h,6 have descended to Earth and are already looking for him. Suddenly they meet him in the jungle. He looks like a ghost and they run away.... We have now reached the passage quoted above as the beginning of Raffles Malay Manuscript no. 22 on which Sir Richard Winstedt has commented. From now on the two manuscripts are similar, but, since Zieseniss's important work starts to analyse the HSR only at the beginning of the Shellabear version, 1 Since Sita Dewi is to be the cause of the war between Sri Rama and Rawana. 2 .1~.II. As will be seen on p. 541, n. 1, and p. 542, n. 4, there are other variations of this name. 3 In Wilkinson the full name is Indera Kisna Dewa (usually spelt IeJ j..f but once .j j.G (K.shana Dewa) and once I. (L (K.sana Dewa). In Raffles it is B'tara Kisna Dewa ( . ?). See also p. 536, n. 6. 4 This seems to be the only occasion in the HSR in which Dewata Mulia Raya is made anthropomorphic-if indeed Dewata Mulia Raya and not a servant of His, such as the Prophet Adam, is considered to own the voice. 6 Here spelt . 4y) but in Raffles usually ! r(.)

For the first name I have hazarded the form Girandiwama on the assumption that it comes from Hirany~iksa (see p. 533, n. 4). In Wilkinson, Girandiwama figures as Gurindam Dewa ( rj jfi ) and Sura M.nak.h as Suraminigah ( ZI ~ ). Whatever their names may have been at this pre-incarnation stage, it is clear that the future Kumbakarna and Surapandiki (i.e. SiTrpan.akh&amp;) are intended. There appears to be no Indian legend regarding a previous life for fiirpanakh&amp; and her other brother Vibhigana (see p. 538, n. 1) but the Malay story has brought them into line in this respect with the other two members of the family, Rivana and Kumbhakarna.</page><page sequence="8">538 E. C. G. BARRETT I shall continue the story up to this point in order to present in one place the whole HSR story of Ravana's previous life in so far as it can now be reconstructed. (W, 14) Siranchak, according to the Wilkinson manuscript, replies to the question about his body being half black and half white and having lost his crowns by weeping, and saying: '0 my brother and sister, it is because I fought Mahabisnu and he kicked me into the Underworld-straight to below the seven patala ... '. (Raffles, p. 1) Then Siranchak asks why his other brother, Semandidama,1 has not accompanied Girandiwama and Sura M. nak.h. Girandi- wama replies: 'He has descended into the World before us 2 for he did not want to accompany us'. Then Siranchak says, 'He cannot be reincarnated to any family but Beramaraja's. We three are also to be reincarnated to that family. BEramaraja is a great and noble king'. Siranchak and his brother and sister now look for a mountain on which to practise asceticism. (R, 2) Their terrifying appearance, however, disturbs a multitude of hermits whose leader, Maharisi Kisnachendera (DJ.-L.?) says: 'According to my horoscope this is Rawana. The sages of old used to say: " If Rawana comes into the World, then Mahabisnu will follow him into the World to kill him ". The maharisi ascertains that Mahabisnu is at the moment too far away-practising asceticism on a mountain top near Mahameru with three dewa zanggi-so they all go to ask protection (R, 3, 4) of one Begawan Raman,3 who has abdicated a kingship and become a hermit on a near-by mountain. Kisnachendera tells the begawan he has come to him because his horoscope tells him that Mahdbisnu is later to be reincarnated to the begawan's family in order to fight Rawana. The begawan (R, 7) sends his servants- a hunchback and a dwarf 4--to fight Siranchak and his brother. The latter are defeated and put to shame. (R, 9) They realize that they must build up their strength by means of a further twelve years of asceticism. Before marching off they throw two mountains at an ivory pavilion in the middle of a pool surrounded by white stone.5 The mountains, however, break asunder and the pieces become thousands of lotus flowers of various colours lying around the ivory pavilion.

Whatever this name is, it is clear that the future Bibusanam (Vibhiqan.a) is intended. 2 Evidently as one of Mahabisnu's dewa zanggi, for, although Bibusanam is to be later incarnated as their brother, he is to help the future Seri Rama against them. 3 According to the genealogy given later in the HSR, Daserat Raman is the son of Daserat and grandson of Adam. He is also (or is to become) the father of Daserat Chakarawati, the grandfather of Daserat Maharaja (the Dagaratha of the Indian stories) and the great-grandfather of Seri Rama. 4 This incident, like the story of Siranchak's previous defeat mentioned above, is reminiscent of V1lmiki, vII, xvi, in which it is a dwarf that stops Rdvana climbing the mountain on which Siva resides. As Dr. C. Hooykaas has pointed out, Javanese influence may also have been brought to bear. Hunchbacks and dwarfs were traditionally adopted as favourites by Javanese rulers. 5 Here again Javanese influence seems discernible. Cf. Dr. Jacoba Hooykaas's 'Upon a white stone under a Nagasari-tree ', BKI, cxIII, 4, 1957: 'A taman in Bali, as late as the 19th century, could only belong to a king. And, we may add, to the gods.... The Balinese taman, belonging to the gods, is described as : " a rectangular tank in the midst of which a small shrine is installed like on a miniature island ".... The famous Taman Sari (" Waterkasteel ") of the Sultans of Jogja was built as late as the end of the 18th century, though earlier traditions may have influenced the outlay.

For that reason I did not kill them myself but told you two to give them a good fight'. Siranchak and his brother and sister climb to the summit of a mountain and start to practise their asceticism, comforting themselves that they will, at the end of twelve years, be reborn to the royal family of Inderapura. (R, 13) When Siranchak has nearly completed his twelve years Dewa Adi BErama 1 comes to him bringing three arrows and saying: (R, 14) 'If these arrows lodge in the body of your adversary, they will instantly grow roots . .. and be incapable of extraction '.2 Siranchak is now ready for rebirth as Rawana and equipped for the future fight 3 against Seri Rama. (R, 11) Meanwhile Mahabisnu is on Mount Inderapikrama with Naga Puspa Pertala Seganda Dewa, the Golden Peacock, and Kisna Dewa. He tells them that Siranchak is about to be reincarnated to the family of Bgramaraja. Kisna Dewa says: 'If Siranchak is soon to be reincarnated to Beramaraja's family, you, Lord, should hasten to be reincarnated before him. Then you can make yourself King of all Kings, before he has a chance of doing so, and the war lords of the World will be on your side '. But Mahabisnu replies : ' Our captains will be the thirty-three score of dewa zanggi and risi muni [Jy ?? ] who have already descended into the World. With their help we shall kill all the great kings on Siranchak's side. These dewa zanggi and risi muni are practising asceticism in order to become monkeys. One monkey will be able to defeat two raksasas '. (R, 12) Two years later Kisna Dewa brings Mahabisnu seven arrows and a bow which he says are a gift to him from Betara Guru. He wishes to pass the gift on to Mahabisnu. The offer angers the naga (R, 13) who says: ' Betara Guru's bow has no more magic power than lies in me'. Mahabisnu reassures him by saying: 'I shall have no weapon other than you', and he is calmed. Mahabisnu then tells Kisna Dewa to use the bow and the arrows himself. They turn into a flower with which Kisna Dewa plays. (R, 14) The story now turns to Beramaraja,4 Overlord of the World with his capital at Inderapura. Both he and his queen are descended from Betara Berahma. He has seven sons, of whom the second is the warrior, Chitrabaha (6L^i-). (R, 15) He sends Chitrabaha (R, 18) to conquer Bihusapurwara (-) Y1 J.), a city ruled by the raksasa king, Dati Kuacha.5 (R, 25) Chitra- 1 ,1p dl !. Evidently BrahmA himself (usually called, in Malay, ' Betara Birahma') who, in Vdlmiki, is Rdvana's particular patron. In the HSR, Betara Berahma, through Beramaraja, is to become Siranchak's ancestor when he is reincarnated as Rawana. 2 This is to happen in the later part of the HSR when Laksamana is struck by one of Rawana's arrows. 3 The Overbeck MS (Hikayat Maharaja Rawana) records that when Rawana is born he has three arrows in his hand. 4 The Javanese Serat kanda gives the previous history of this king. The demon king Kuwatja Indra conquers Giling Wesi (Ind6rapura) from Brama and is about to storm the Abode of the Gods. The gods send for three champions, Sritruqta, Adiserat Anjakrawati (Daseirat Chakirawati in Malay), and Bramaradja (Beramaraja). The first is promised that his descendants will rule all Java, the second that he will rule Bruwaskandi, and the third that he will rule Inderapura. Kuwatja Indra is defeated and his body disappears. Adiserat Anjakrawati (grandfather of the future Rama) and Bramaradja duly take over the kingdoms promised to them. The details of Beramaraja's family in the Javanese and Malay stories are similar (Stutterheim, op. cit., 66-7). 6 vl J i.e. Daitya Kuacha. According to the Javanese story quoted immediately above, 'Niti Kuwatja', Demon King of 'Bruaspurwa' is one of the three sons of Kuwatja Indra. (The other two sons are Daitja Sumangli and Djambu Mangli-clearly the Sumali and Mali of VSlmiki).</page><page sequence="10">540 E. C. G. BARRETT baha kills Dati Kuacha and marries his daughter Raksagandi (.~ LJ)). After a hundred years of pregnancy (R, 27) she gives birth to an enormous child who is (R, 28) called ' Rawana '.1 When he is twelve years old Rawana acquires the habit of flying into rages and killing his playmates. His grandfather orders that he be banished.2 (R, 30) Chitrabaha accordingly leads Rawana to a boat, (R, 31) and his servants take the boy out to sea and maroon him on the island of ' Shrandib Hill'." On arrival there, Rawana collects three lotus flowers, one of them red.4 (R, 32) He gives these to the servants who have manned the boat and tells them to take them back to his parents with a message that they are to eat them, and that, as a result, his mother will give birth to two sons and a daughter. He adds that, unless they send these children to him immediately after birth, his parents will die without seeing him again.5 His parents later eat the flowers and his mother gives birth to one daughter, (R, 40 ; Shellabear, 6) Surapandiki, and two sons, Kumbakarna and Bibusanam. Now follows the Malay Ramayana story as told in the Roorda and Shellabear versions of the HSR and carefully analysed by Stutterheim and Zieseniss. The Raffles version, on which Sir Richard Winstedt has commented, is, from this point onwards, to a great extent a combination of the two. Although the passages described above have launched Siranchak and his brothers and sister in the World in their new form, Mahabisnu and his three companions in asceticism, whom we last saw on Mount Inderapikrama, have not yet been so launched, and nor have the thirty-three score of dewa zanggi. The story of the reincarnation of these beings has been subjected to varying degrees of Islamic censorship on the part of successive copyists of the different manuscrpits, but enough remains to show that there was once full continuity between the new beginning to the Malay Rama saga, now revealed, and the manuscripts which have been analysed or described in the past. Perhaps the following summaries of passages in such manuscripts (which now for the first time reveal their full meaning) will be sufficient to show the truth of this: 1 The reincarnation of Siranchak. 2 The story of the banishment of Rawana to Ceylon occurs in somewhat similar form in both the HSR and the Serat kanda. Zieseniss (op. cit., 66) shows that it is derived from the Mahdvam.sa or 'Great Chronicle of Ceylon', in which Vijaya, the founder of the kingdom of Ceylon, is similarly treated. 3 From the Arabic for 'Ceylon', an island connected with the Muslim Prophet Adam as well as with Rdvaga. Adam is to act as the intermediary of Dewata Mulia Raya in granting Rawana overlordship of the Earth, the Keinderaan, the Underworld, and the Sea. Adam is the only Muslim personality to appear again and again in the HSR and it is possible that the original Muslim adapter of this very unislamic saga has intended to ascribe it to the Stage of Revelation of the first of the Prophets. 4 The nymphaea lotus (here called tunjong) of the Malay world is usually white but sometimes rose-coloured (Burkill, Dictionary of the economic products of the Malay Peninsula). The flower of differing hue is possibly to lead to the birth of Bibusanam who, in strong contrast to his brother and sister, is one of Mahabisnu's dewa zanggi. 5 They fail to obey his instruction and duly die. 6 ..X ,, , and :..

There are slight variations in other MSS.) See p. 537, n. 6, and p. 538, n. 1.</page><page sequence="11">FURTHER LIGHT ON WINSTEDT'S ' MALAY VERSION OF RAMAYANA' 541 (Raffles, 65-6) Bibusanam (while still a young boy at the Inderapura court) asks the sage Anggasapurawah ( ?l ) where Mahabisnu is. The sage replies: 'As I have ascertained from my horoscope, you, my son, know what Mahabisnu has said. How is it that you do not know that he has descended into the World with his steed, the Golden Peacock, and a serpent from the Sea of Milk, called Naga Puspa Pertala Seganda Dewa, who is to turn himself into Mahabisnu's weapons after Mahabisnu has been reincarnated ? Mahabisnu is at present practising asceticism on Mount Inderakilanagerma.1 He will incarnate himself to a certain ruler after seven more weeks '. Now comes the story of the birth of Seri Rama, Laksamana, and Sita Dewi, which is approximately the same in all versions of the Hikayat SMri Rama although Shellabear shows signs of considerably greater bowdlerization. Direct mention of incarnation of gods has been excised from all known versions, but it is nevertheless possible to read the original story 'between the lines'. (Roorda, 3 ff.; Shellabear, 53 ff.; Raffles, 133 ff.) Daserat Maharaja marries a supernatural being called Mandudari,2 who has been found in magical circum- stances in a clump of bamboo. He also has a concubine, Baliadari, who is an ordinary human being. He wishes to have children, so he calls in a sage of great magical power who, in the course of the subsequent homan ceremony, says incantations over some wheaten meal.3 After two hours, the wheaten meal becomes 'mature' and the sage divides it into six lumps, three of which he gives to Mandudari and three to Baliadari.4 Baliadari, the human being, eats her three lumps and later gives birth to three undistinguished children-two boys and a girl. Before Mandudari, the supernatural being, can eat her three lumps, one is snatched out of her hand by a demon in the shape of a crow. She is, however, able to eat two lumps and subsequently two boys of great supernatural power are born to her-S-ri Rama, who is emerald-green like Mahabisnu, and Laksamana, who, like Betara Kisna Dewa, is of the colour of gold.5 Meanwhile the demon crow has taken the third lump to his relative 1 Another form of Ind~rapikrama mentioned on p. 537, n. 2. 2 In Vitlmiki, Rdma's mother is Kausalyi and Mandodari is the name of Riva.na's wife (who does not give birth to Sit&amp;). As will be seen above, there are in the HSR two Mandudaris, a real one and a magical copy of her. 3 In Shellabear, bezoar stones. 4 In Shellabear the bezoar stones are only four in number and appear to have no function other than to cause fertility. Only four children are born--two to Mandudari and two to Baliadari, mention of a girl being omitted. Mention of the Demon Crow is also omitted. It is clear that the story in Roorda and Raffles, or something similar to it, has been deliberately altered in Shellabear in order to avoid any hint of incarnation by a Hindu god or gods. Similar bowdlerization has taken place at several points in Shellabear where the Hindu religion has seemed to a Muslim copyist to obtrude itself too obviously. For the Indian origin of the story see Zieseniss, op. cit., 69 ; he says that, in Polier's Mythologie des Indous, Paris, 1809, Da'aratha receives from the R1is a consecrated rice cake for Kausalyi (mother of the future Rima) who shares it with the other wives. 5 As Father Bulcke has pointed out, in Vaclmiki all four boys are incarnations of Vi.nu in varying degrees, an effect obtained by the division of the payasa. As the Bhakti cult developed during the centuries that followed the tenth century, R~ma alone became a full incarnation of Vi.nu and Laksmana became an incarnation of Sesa-ndga. The HSR version is probably a further development of this--,Sri Rama alone is considered the incarnation of Mahabisnu, but a naga is incarnated as Seri Rama's magic arrows instead of as Laksamana, Laksamana becoming an incarnation of B'tara Kisna Dewa, i.e. Krona. This latter development may or may not be connected with the fact that, in the Pampa-Rdmdyana (an ancient Jain poem published by Lewis Rice at Bangalore in 1882), Lakqmana is an incarnation of Visudeva-Kr.na, R~ma being an incarnation of his elder brother Baladeva.</page><page sequence="12">542 E. C. G. BARRETT Rawana; and Rawana has eaten it. Later Mandudari, for fear of Rawana, creates another supernatural being in her exact likeness, and Rawana sleeps with this pseudo-Mandudari,' who then gives birth to a beautiful daughter, Sita Dewi.2 (Roorda, 11-12) Rawana comes upon and is cursed by, an ascetic called Kisuberisu,3 one of the dewa zanggi who have descended to serve the reincarnated Mahabisnu. Kisuberisu has practised austerities for 200 years in order to acquire three sons in the form of birds to serve as steeds for Mahabisnu in his terrestrial fight against Siranchak. (Roorda, 23) 'When Mahabisnu and the Golden Peacock were practising asceticism on the summit of Mount Bimachalam,4 Naga Puspa Pertala Seganda Dewa 5 carried out his austerities at the foot of the mountain. When Mahabisnu, Betara [Kisna] Dewa, and the Golden Peacock descended to be incarnated to the family of Daserat Maharaja, Naga Puspa Pertala Seganda Dewa did not know about this. At a certain time he went to Mahabisnu's hermitage and said : " Lord, according to my prognostication, it would be best, when you are incarnated, for you to become the Ruler of all Mankind in the World ". But he received no reply. Then he knew that Mahabisnu had already been incarnated, and started to search for him on Earth.' On arrival at the summit of Mount Gangsaindera (,1J.,? ) he found Seri Rama practising asceticism on a lotus flower, very beautiful and of the colour of emerald; he recognized him as Mahabisnu and prostrated himself. . ... Seri Rama said that he had been practising asceticism there in order to be able to meet him. Then the naga turned himself into three arrows, called ' Gandewata', 'Palewata', and 'Chindewata' respectively.6 Seri Rama then went to his guru, Begawan Nilapurba ('.?i4) -J) and said: 'Lord, if you love me, I request a bow, for I now have three arrows bestowed on me by Dewata Mulia Raya'. The bUgawan replied: 'I know the origin of those arrows and I see, in my mind's 1 To keep the story as simple as possible, I have not mentioned above that, in the HSR, Daserat sleeps with the Pseudo-Mandudari before Rawana and thus secretly becomes the father of the child. This incident appears to be no more than an interpolation as Father Camille Bulcke has pointed out in the concluding paragraphs of' La naissance de SitU ', BEFEO, XLVI, 1, 1952, 107-17. The incident occurs nowhere outside the HSR and the Serat kanda, and has evidently been inserted by someone who does not want the heroine to be born to the villain ! 2 Mahabisnu seems to have intended that his wife Dewi Seri (or the Golden Peacock ?) be incarnated as a result of Mandudari eating her third lump of wheaten meal, but, since Rawana ate the lump in her place, she seems to have been inadvertently incarnated as his daughter. Father Bulcke (op. cit., 110) points out that there are many later Rima stories, that give Rdvana as the father of Siti-in India, Tibet, Khotan, Siam, and Java. The Javanese Serat kanda version (Stutterheim, 74-5) is briefly as follows: Wisnu, Sri, and Basuki the Naga incarnate themselves-Wisnu and the naga as sons of Dasarata, and Sri as the daughter of one Bibitsamuka. Rahwana chases the reincarnated Sri and she changes herself into an egg. Rahwana swallows the egg and later sleeps with the pseudo-Bandondari to whom a beautiful daughter-Sinta-is accordingly born. 3 As pointed out on p. 535, n. 4, this is a reincarnation of Be'gawan Bisparupan. Zieseniss (p. 70) derives the name Kisuberisu (~,i p ) from Kagyapa + .ri (which might be spelt , i ). His three sons all have a fairly big part to play in the Raffles version of the HSR. 4 ?L..

It is that bow which will become your weapon and which will kill Maharaja Rawana and his children and grandchildren. It results from the asceticism of the thirty-three score of dewa zanggi and rasi muni '. Uncensored passages, such as the above, making clear mention of the incarnation of Visnu as Rdma, do not appear in the oldest Hikayat Skri Rama manuscript, that published by Shellabear. Such omissions, however, are explained by the Muslim copyist (' All that which is not good has been excised by Your Highness's humble servant' 2) and confirm Zieseniss's finding that the Shellabear version, from the point of view of content, is undoubtedly younger than the Roorda version. As Sir Richard Winstedt has pointed out, it is also younger than the Raffles version. The new beginning to the Hikayat Skri Rama outlined above, while explaining certain features in the Roorda and Shellabear versions which seem to have puzzled Zieseniss, tends to confirm Zieseniss's conclusions, notably that the bulk of the material in the Malay saga reached the Malay world between the thirteenth and the seventeenth centuries by word of mouth, partly from the east of India and partly from the west.3 It is interesting that this material should have been consolidated in the Malay world into so extensive a written saga, and that this, almost in its full form, should have survived in Malay for so many Muslim centuries. 1 or Jf = Janaka, adoptive father of Siti and owner of the Great Bow of giva. The name also occurs in the Javanese Serat kanda. 2 Other pious sentiments are to follow in the copyist's introduction. All mention of Mahabisnu and other elements that the copyist has been able to recognize as definitely Hindu in the earlier part of the MS have been excised. He is more careless in the later part. 3 See Zieseniss, op. cit., 114.</page></plain_text>
