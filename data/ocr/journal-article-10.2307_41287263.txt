<plain_text><page sequence="1">LA RASSEGNA MENSILE DI ISRAEL III Summaries The Antropomorphic Representation of God in the Midrash (Maurizio Mottolese) In light of new approaches to the Rabbinical thought and language, the old question of the anthropomorphisms can be substantially revisited. The main purpose of this inquiry is to verify in which sense the human image of God did not constitute a problem for the Rabbis, and how, on the con- trary, it could be employed to express their most intimate experience of the "faces" or "ways" of the Divine. The formulas connected to such representations (such as kivjakhol) should not be taken as a mitigation of the corporeal image of God, but rather as a way to emphasize in the image the status of "interpretation-representation". Such formulas intro- duce indeed bold descriptions of God as a conflicting or weak "persona- lity", who needs help and even redemption from the human beings. Yet, the language of the Midrash Aggada displays in various ways a deep dia- lectic between instances of mythical imagery and strategies of metaphori- cal discourse. The crisis of this balance (and the perplexity about the anthropomorphic language) had decisive implications in Medieval Judaism. Rosenzweig's refreshing approach to this issue illuminates the religious experience in a new way (as dynamic and polimorphous mee- ting), and therefore understands the anthropomorphic discourse as a main way to mediate that experience. The Jewish Community of San Daniele del Friuli in the XVII Century (Lara Pironio) In many ways the Jewish community of San Daniele del Friuli enjoyed a fortunate existence compared with Jews in other settlements in the region. They were protected from the patriarchs, whose jurisdiction in San Daniele continued even after the Venetian Conquest (1420), owing to the churchstate accord of 1445. The Jews took fair advantage of this situation, in fact no ghetto was ever erected in San Daniele and Jewish residents lived in various part of town and they were free to carry out various acti- vities, which contributed towards the development of commerce in gene- ral (they traded second hand clothing, sold animal fodder, raised live- stock) particularly towards the production of silk. At least for the first half of the 17th century, the community standard of living seems to have been good, especially since the economy was steadily growing. Dowry con- tracts for the community found in the Archivio di Stato di Udine confirm the point. Their favourable position changed after the abolition of the last</page><page sequence="2">IV LA RASSEGNA MENSILE DI ISRAEL patriarc Daniele Dolfin in 1762. The final expulsion of the Jewish people from San Daniele took place in 1777 (year of the Venetian injunction of expulsion). But notarial acts prove that, even after 1777 there was still a slight presence of Jewish people in San Daniele. An important trace of San Daniele's Jewish past is to be found in the cemetery and in the syna- gogue which was demolished in our century, during the sixties. The new Israeli Historiography (David Bidussa) The debate began in Israeli Historiography in the late 1980's with the books by Simha Flapan, Benny Morris, Avi Shlaim and Ilan Pappe, seems a political one. But the scientific use of documentary sources, and the quarrel on interpretation about origins and previous years of the State of Israel and Israely society have a different and enlarged meaning too and a more general value. All the discussion in Israel is a consequence of the crisis of Israeli civic religion and de facto is around the cultural and social foundation of a second generation Israely society after the fulfillment of political Zionist programm. New Historiography, in fact, is not only about the origins of the State, but around new trends in Judaica, in Biblical studies too. This is the foundation of a new "common sense". A Lonely Piano in the night by S. Yizhar (pres. Raffaella Scardi) S. Yizhar, whose real name is Yizhar Smilansky, was born in Rechovot in 1916. He started writing before the foundation of the State of Israel, and since than he has been concerned with a number of subjects connected to his personal experience as a sabra born from a pioneers' family: doubts and difficulties of the first generation of "New Jews" in the fulfillment of the expectations of the Founding Fathers; life and work in the agricultural settlements; the conflict between the importance of col- lective and individual needs, and love for the Land of Israel. Yizhar's language is extremely rich, and his style unique: the focus is on the subjective impressions of the hero, or of the group of heroes, and consequently he often uses the interior monologue and the stream of con- sciousness techniques. In 1992, after almost thirty years of silence, Yizhar started a second period of production to which belongs the short story A Lonely Piano in the Night (from the collection Asides , 1996). Musical impressions and the reality of a boarding school for children escaped from the Holocaust alternate, and so do the hints to far-away Europe, fascinating and terrible, and to the simple life in the Yishuv, on whose unhappiness and fears Art spreads its beauty.</page></plain_text>
