<plain_text><page sequence="1">Judaism and Marxism First European Dialogue In April 1968 several members of the editorial board of European Judaism met members of the Communist Party to discuss their differences and agreements. Prof Gollwitzer' s definition of ' Sprache zwischen Feinden ' ( dialogue between opponents) applies to this meeting . It must be clearly understood that this was a preliminary meeting , one which probed into many areas , was uncertain of itself did not come to a clear exposition on either side . It would be manifestly unfair to publish the full recording of the proceedings . If we, nevertheless , bring some short extracts to the attention of our readers , we do so in order to indicate that there are opportunities for speech between opponents which must be utilized in the context of an open society . The extracts cannot indicate the specific position of any of the speakers ; they are evidences of the moment , of the occasion , of the beginning of a confrontation , and they are human documents . Participants : From European Judaism, Dr. A. Friedlander , Dr. D. Goldstein , M. Goulston , D. Marmur , Dr. I. Maybaum and J. Rayner. From the Communist Party , John Clement-Dix Dunman, Balliol College , Oxford , Industrial Dept. of C. P. 1937-67, lecturer in economics , N. W. Polytechnic. Hyman Fagan , C. P. organizer 1928 , in charge of Parliamentary and local gvt. dept. at Communist Party head office 1945-52. Chairman , National Jewish committee 1947-48. Currently a journalist for World Marxist Review (Prague). James Klugmann, Editor, Marxism Today. Dr. John Lewis, lecturer in philosophy at Morley College, London, author of many books. Goulston: I'm interested in our tackling crucial points, and being able to delineate them so that we can then discuss them. What I want to try and avoid is presenting conflicting assertions, which always seems to land one in a sort of ideological cul-de-sac. I'd like to discover what are the areas of shared concern, and what can each of our two 'disciplines', theoretically and exis- tentially, offer to their resolution? . . . I'm going to assume that we will not consider what one might call Jewish revisionist versions of Marxism as found for example in Mapai or in Achdut Avodah, the various expressions of Marxism within the Israeli scene. I'm assuming this because, speaking for my own editorial board, we are not experts in these areas - obviously we could sit and listen to a lecture from you about a socio-economic analysis of capitalism, with great profit - excuse the term! - but nevertheless I feel that one wants to get into dialogue. I'm also assuming that you will not be experts, or at least particularly deeply versed, in say the halachic - that is the Jewish legal - standpoint on human labour, on employer/employee relationships, about property etc. - This is, as far as I know, the first dialogue between Marxism and Judaism that has taken place, and you will understand that we shall represent a progressive form of Judaism; Of course it isn't the first time that Marxists and Jews (those can be within the same person) have conducted a dialogue. Thinking back into recent Jewish history we remember Ber Borochov who was very much concerned with precisely his Jewish existence and his Marxist principles. Friedlander: Rightly or wrongly we felt that you are wandering around having dialogues with Christians, and have had it far too easy - that is in terms of meeting Judaism and Jewish thinkers - and of course what we have here is not really Marxism against Judaism, but individuals who've been influenced by 30</page><page sequence="2">one, the other, or both - who combine both in them- selves, and can react without being the ultimate spokes- men for any approach within these fields. We felt that so many of the criticisms that you've been able to level against the Church, as one example, were made easier by the fact that Church and state had made an alliance, over the centuries, which already plunged the Church into situations where it was, and where it is, very easy to attack it. Whether by accident of history or Constantin√©'s Edict or what-have-you, we have been preserved from these fatal encounters. We might say that in terms of Marxism there is the same situation, but we cannot just look at the past half-century of Russia, and try to arrive at final conclusions from this. So also the recent emergence of Israel has not really got to the position where we can say Judaism has taken on the power of the state and has accepted it and has made an alliance and therefore can be judged. But just looking over these past two thousand years we'd say that some of the criticisms that Marxism has had of the church would not be valid of the synagogue, . . . the whole attitude of Judaism and Christianity differed profound- ly in terms of the emphasis on providing hope for another world: basically, we are 4 O lam Hazeniks' affirmers of this world . . . Some say that we cannot and should not get involved with the criticism that Marxism has of religion. I question this: basically you are not attacking Christianity as an inferior religion but Christianity as religion. Judaism also is a religion, has a theology, has an approach to life which I think is open to attack from Marxism, a question we share: How can the prophetic ideal be realized in an open society? Is religion - is Judaism - an inhibiting factor or does it help a man in achieving the fulness of his potentialities, and possibilities. I think at one point we'd be interested in asking you - in the case of a Jewish background - if you consider Marxism to be the 31 proper development from it or, do you feel it to be an emancipation from it? But again, we'd have to be careful and you would have to volunteer it more than our challenging and getting it from you. By the same token of course you should feel free, looking at the assorted rabble of rabbis that you see here, to question us : why in fact, professing the ideals for the creation of a better society as we do would we feel that it is in our profession and in organized religion that we best realize our ideals? Lewis: Now, I do immensely sympathise - I'm con- stantly asserting and re-asserting this in discussions and controversy - with the this-worldliness of the Hebrew tradition, the tradition that it is the transformation, the re-generation of this world that is the whole aim and purpose of religion . . . Here is ground for a substantial unity. The question in that case is, well, where does the difference begin? Perhaps in the fact that Marxism endeavours to avoid what I may call the hypostasizing of ethical concepts. It seeks to avoid the fallacy of misplaced concreteness, by which I mean the creation even of a moral world, the world of moral truth, let alone the world of sacred existence . . . Marxism doesn't do this. Of course Marxism sees the ethical imperative arising historically and concretely all the time. If we formulate a general principle it must be a general principle relative to the concrete, relative to the existing situation, relative to the complexities of the existing social problem. It doesn't mean to say that you don't enunciate princi- ples, but you don't have hypostatised principles.Then there is the whole conception of Utopia, of the King- dom of God . . . Marx never really looked at religon and said 'Opium of the people'. It was not his view at all. His view of religion was very closely associated with his view of Utopia, his view of the Kingdom of God: if man is</page><page sequence="3">Judaism and Marxism | First European Dialogue incapacitated, prevented, obstructed in the realisation of a full human life, by reason of living in a class society, or for any reason, he would always project beyond himself whatever he feels he ought to be. He would always project society, which he feels is desirable, it's the potentiality which he wants to realise, it's the goal towards which human effort should be directed, and he may call this the ideal utopia of socialism. He may call it the Kingdom of God, he may call it the City of God, he may call it the fellowship of the saints? he may call it the brotherhood of man, he may call it the attainment of the righteousness of God, in socialist terms. But, says Marx, while this is inevitable and necessary, and a very good thing, certainly not to be despised, or cast aside as an illusion, there comes a time in the history of the world when it becomes possible for the first time to begin the concrete realisa- tion of this. At this point, all conceptions of God, all sorts of ideal principles, become obstructions to the actual realisation of what you are aiming at. Put it this way. The ideal kingdom, or the moral ideal, or the ideal man, these things are all projections of that which one must certainly aim at and cannot but separate from history and the concrete existence and everything in life, as long as it is unobtainable and unrealisable. When it becomes realisable, the whole business is the realisation of philosophy, in which case philosophy comes to an end; the realisation of religion, in which case religion comes to end; the realisation of a set of abstract principles, in which case as abstract principles they cease. Now this, Marx says, is the transformation, the transfiguration, the redemption, the regeneration, of the social world, the political human world, it's a coming down into social relations, of that which has hitherto been beyond. This is why, to come back to 'opium', Marx refused to call himself an atheist, he 32 said it was a preposterous idea, he couldn't possibly be one, the god of which was man, in his essence and in his potentiality. . . Friedlander: Abasie difference emerges here, particularly in the theoretic field. I think we would have to reserve for ourselves a right to hypostatise, the right to the transcendent God, and yet, we recognise that in the realm of men there is a sharedness where in fact the coming kingdom of God, the messianic days, also from the rabbinic point of view bring with them the cessation of the mitzvot, of many aspects of religion. Lewis : What matters is not so much the general idea as the steps towards its realisation, and the immediate duty that confronts man as to what to do next. For instance the overcoming of the dichotomy between owner and worker; the overcoming of the class dis- tinction on which exploitation is based. So that what immediately confronts you is not a broad general idea of the sacredness of human personality, in which anybody can believe. Where we come into conflict is that our duty, our categorical imperative, as Marxism says, lies in the first steps towards the immediate re- alisation of a classless society - in other words, an attack on class privilege and class ownership, and everything that's involved in it, and our ethic grows out of this, and grows round this. Goldstein : What was religion in Marx' day? Did he think that the Kingdom of God, or Utopia, from the religious viewpoint was a messianic idea, that is to say this Utopia would come in God's good time, and irrespective of what man did about it? Because if he felt that this was the religious view then I would agree with Marx, because from our point of view we believe that the Jew should be involved in the world, he should be working in the world, he should try and achieve a just society, he should try and achieve individual liber-</page><page sequence="4">ty. There I think we are more or less running along parallel lines . . . Marmur : I'm a bit worried about this attempt to say 'well, we have so much in common and we are running on parallel lines.' This is no doubt true in relation to the this-worldly aspect of Judaism . . . but however this-worldly Judaism can be, we are concerned with the metaphysical reality of God. Not as a hallucination on our part, but as a conviction that he is there, and speaks to us, and with that in mind it seems that how- ever we interpret that metaphysical reality, it's never- theless there. On this basis I think we part company pretty fundamentally, I don't think that we are even able to discuss that aspect, so what we are reduced to in our discussions is a discussion about the management of society . . . Lewis: This dichotomy isn't as ultimate as you'd perhaps imagine. For after all, you say God speaks to you from outside. (Yes) But what he asks you to do, surely, is something relevant to the world in which you live, and the duty which confronts you, isn't that so? Maybaum : What is the date today? 1968? Or are we back in the 18th century, where such problems were discussed?. . . Lewis: The problem that I'm raising was not dis- cussed in the Enlightenment at all. The duty which we have found to be God's commandments surely confronts us in the concrete situation. The sacredness arises in the actual social relationship between us and another man. Maybaum: This is a good piece of Marxist humanism, or of bourgeois humanism, there is no difference! (laughter). However what you said before, about the Hebrew tradition I accept, but to such a degree that I'm prepared to call Karl Marx a Jewish prophet. Lewis: The important thing is to move from the theore- 33 tical to the practical level. Because what we are working for, and where we find ourselves joining forces with Christians and others, is for instance, on the Vietnam war, or is on nuclear disarmament, or is on certain problems of housing and poverty, where we are not merely confronted with a theoretical discussion as to what is the source of the categorical imperative, but with a categorical imperative . . . This is what the Marxist means by bringing the thing down from the projected, from the world of principle, from the world of theory, from the world of utopia, and meeting it in an actual concrete situation in which we in the world of 1968 are totally immersed, so that God is calling to us, shouting to us, pressing upon us, calling us, urging us to particular duties in this particular situation, just as he called and urged and pressed the Hebrew prophets in particular situations, in particular circumstances, in a very concrete way. Maybaum: I agree with you, to the very detriment of our discussion, because we want to find the differences between Marxism and Judaism. We are not discussing the difference between the two economic systems. What is interesting to me is, what is there Jewish in Marxism? The Christian attitude was - not representing the whole of Christianity today - to speak of 'dirty matter'. 'Matter' was something low. The spirit, that was the right thing. And the work of Marx was to rehabilitate matter. Matter is the basis of the superstructure. The whole culture is a superstruc- ture and based on matter. And Simone Weil is another Jewess who wrestled with Marxism. She has a wonder- ful sentence - she says, 'there is a silent obedience in matter'. Now what she calls matter I call the created world - the world as creation, that's what she means. That rehabilitates matter. And Marx - I praise him - did the same in philosophy as Freud did in psychology. I have recently written - 'Since the days of Homer,</page><page sequence="5">Judaism and Marxism | First European Dialogue certainly since Aristotle, the main human spirit tried to dominate and suppress the Mater (Latin word for Mother), reappearing in the word 'matter'. Matter in the 'mater' the hopelessly incorrigible lower part of the people should be kept under, through castles, mon- asteries and ideologies. So shall woman be kept in the prison of marriage laws, conceived by male minds. Marx and Freud liberated the material world, the world of the mothers. In God's perfect creation male and female are both present'. That's how I see something Jewish in Marx' philosophy . . . And we differ with Marxism on its concept of history. Rosenzweig said: 'We refuse to see God in history. We see God in every ethical enterprise within history but not in the imagined totality of history. For Hegel, history was God-like. Our opposition to the concept of history in the sense of the 19th century, Hegel, and Hegel sur- viving in Marx, is our real fighting world, fit for the 20th century.' This sentence, this attitude of Hegel to see history as a God-like process explained to me the riddle of the purges. I mean, how some of the victims behaved at the purges. They knew they were innocent. They gave in and signed their guilt often not out of cowardice but out of a sacrifice for history. Even their own destruction is a necessary sacrifice on the altar of history. In this way Hegel saw history, Marx took it over, and the Marxists from Marx. . . Here is the main fault of Marxism, to speak of laws of history. Because here Marx is victim of the scientific age. He sees history proceeding according to laws, and this is not biblical. The biblical view of history is that there can always be something new. . . The Jew hopes, but he does not cal- culate. Utopian man does not really hope, because, he has a scientific blueprint for utopia. Therefore it is not true that utopianism in Marxism is Jewish or Christian. Lewis : I would not have thought there was a contradic- tion between hope and laws, because all the laws of 34 history are not known, and therefore the fact that there are laws of history does not also exclude the fact that there can be surprises. Klugmann: A couple of personal comments. This dia- logue is difficult, I think. In a way the tape recorder shouldn't be there. Not for security or secrecy, but because we are only trying to explore what we're trying to do ; are there problems that it's worth while discussing in common, and what are these problems? And this is an awkward thing, because you're feeling your way around, and you're not actually discussing problems, you're discussing what problems are worthy of discussion, and how you should deal with them. So this is a process that has to be gone through, it's very valuable, but incredibly muddled: and that's as it should be. Secondly it's difficult - this is still personal - because we're at different levels. John Lewis has studied theology at various stages of his career, and is con- versant with Judaism. You ask for personal confessions. I'm a terrible Jew. You see I was born Jewish but went to Christian schools, I had an atheist Jewish mum, and my father went to synagogue four times a year, on a Saturday with ham sandwiches in his pocket, and I know nothing at all about Judaism ... I hope to learn more about Judaism of this meeting. . . about its 'this worldly' side . . . About the 'super-natural' or 'other- worldly being' ... I can disagree about this, but it's important for me to know. This has come up in some of the Christian discussi- ons, because when we discuss with Christian people they're at all different levels, different types of theology. One of the most difficult discussions that we have had was with the very new Theologians, whether Roman Catholic or South Bank Protestant, to whom God outside has disappeared, and God inside has disap- peared, when the word Christian atheism arose, one of my people said, in a very embarrassed way, 'if you</page><page sequence="6">don't believe in anything, how can I disbelieve in him?' This brings me to a word only, to introduce, and to ask for your view on, man, his potentiality and his capacity for change. Because I'm not so strong in philosophical language, let me try and put it in simpler language that you could query, in technical terms, but which are not the technical language of either side.I came to Marxism as a student, I was a young rebel, always, at school, but mainly in the superstructural sphere of ideas, literature, art, whatever it was that I was studying. At Cambridge, I was a bright young lad and considered young Cambridge/Oxford intellectuals as the cream of the earth. Till hard facts, the days of the thirties, the unemployed marchers marching through Cambridge, the lies of Nazism, Fascism, war, shook me, with my generation, and we came in contact, first, with the working class. This was an utter revelation - revolution if you like, in our lives, because we were meeting a new sort of person whom we hadn't met before, and what shook us, and I'm speaking for many many people who became, have since become, the most famous scientists, writers, and for their sins even statesmen, of the thirties generation, what shook us was that we were meeting a new type of person who in many ways was deeper and wider than ourselves, with greater capacities. His own life at the bench, factory, and pit, unemployment, although it had incapacitated him in book learning, made it difficult for him to read sometimes and to study, yet had a capacity, a mind that could more rapidly embrace some quite deep ideas than sometimes intellectuals who had not lived outside the intellectual movement. From that moment I began to think in terms, in which I think most Marxists, think, of the fantastic potentiality of all human beings, provided they are not mentally sick. . . You see I eventually gave up my studies, my research, and became if you like a politician in the sense that I 35 worked for years full time with the youth movement, anti-fascist youth and student movement, first in France, then in the sort of illegal movement of the Balkans, then I was in India, China, and rushing around the world. Then I had five years in the war, mainly attached to the guerrilla movements, and my life has brought me up against this fantastic creative capacity of people whom the theoreticians and historians have often considered to be utterly uncreative, without ca- pacity, like Chinese peasants and Yugoslav workers. So how do you let loose - this is the great question - this capacity? I think there are two deviations, two false ways in, of looking at the transformation of men, or the letting loose of their potentialities. I'm asking you about Judaism - but in relation to Christianity one of the mistakes, I think, of the ways in, is that many Christians believe that you change man first and then change his society. It's a form of instant conversion linked with God . . . As I've travelled round the world to my horror I've met the products of conversion, you see, black - yellow, who have been artificially converted, do you under- stand, skin deep. Therefore I don't think you just con- vert men first, and then men start building the new society. . . I believe changing society is one of the essential things. Because I believe that built into society as it is are restrictions on the development of human capacity, therefore society has to be chan- ged to a form where human potentiality can be better developed. But it's quite wrong, I think, to imagine that you just have a revolutionary change in the order of society and man is now the perfect man of the vision. I think the great thing is activity as distinct from passivity, or democracy as distinct from both totalitarianism, and its awkward form, which is often paternalism. . . We do have a general picture of the society that we think now could be built, in decades, or hundreds of</page><page sequence="7">Judaism and Marxism | First European Dialogue years, which is a classless society, which is a society where machines if you like can do the hard, repetitive, monotonous work, where the work that men do will be pleasure . . . where men can become really human . . . So it would be most valuable if you can explain more about the this-worldliness in relation to God, and also about the longer-term vistas, so that I would be in a position to make comparisons. About purely political things I would think probably it's better for us not, at any rate at this time, to get involved. In for example the politics of Israel, which I don't think is a question of Marxism versus Judaism, and I think will get in the way of these discussions. I'm not averse to them in other places, if anybody wants them, but I would be awfully grateful for more information as a basis for further dialogue. Dunman: May I add two sentences in amplification of Klugmann's first question. You see my background is Methodist and my dialogue hitherto has been entirely with Christians, and when Marmur made his remark about the voice of God coming from outside, it struck me that most of the Christians that we have been dialoguing with would not have answered so unambiguously as you did. And I'm anxious to know whether this un- ambiguous formulation about that, is a sort of com- plete point of agreement between you, or whether in the modern theological tendencies which are taking place in all religions, including yours, there is a school of thought that would give, shall we say, a more ambig- uous answer to that question? Marmur : I think it's a crude phrase which I used. Dr. Maybaum speaks of the transcendental, and again we are on the same ground. Without wanting to go into the modern theology, I am not sure that I am less concerned with modernist trends in theology than the next rabbi, but nevertheless it seems to me that we are at pains in a dialogue like this - and it was more to 36 avoid this, and slightly for polemic purposes - to say that we are so much alike, you know, to forget that whatever our theological definitions may be, we are nevertheless, as far as I am concerned fundamentally, at a stage where we say, 'there we part company' ... I for one, if I may be autobiographical, was in the Marxist tradition, I was for 7 years in the Soviet Union. But nevertheless I say there I part company - my rebellion is in a way a return to religion. And I'm simply feeling my way round to ask to what extent Marxism as you present it - as a philosophical disci- pline, as a practical programme - is a little bit pass√©? Friedlander : Judaism lives in a secular world where Protestants still feel uncomfortable and apologetic . . . They want to leave all that transcendental baggage outside, because they've just come into this new world, and they're using a new language in the secular world and trying to establish a beach-head. Now we've been in it for thousands of years! We're much more relaxed, we can affirm our transcendental roots and speak in this manner even though then when we try to assess what actually is revelation we may come to spell it out in somewhat more cumbersome language. But we live much more comfortably in the knowledge that the transcendent is part of our life . . . and we differ with the Marxist view on religion . . . Marxism seems to feel that the freed man in the new world cannot have re- ligion. After all, what is it but looking for the superman and for the good things in terms of a reflection, which man will not need once he is in the new society ... It started really in terms of Feuerbach's saying 'only the poor man has a rich God' . . . Religion is part of the Jewish vision of the new world. Man is not limited, but is an unlimited, open quality; and as far as we are con- cerned that part of this open-ness consists in the re- lationship, in the dialogue between God and man. Fagan: May I break my silence, and I do so because</page><page sequence="8">I'm one of the simple workmen whom Klugmann met when he left Cambridge . . . I'm a better Jew than he was - I was even Barmitzvah'd - but my Jewish up- bringing was very strict, my parents believed in an anthropomorphic God; to my mother God was very real, extremely real, and so was the Holy Land - in fact we used to put our pennies in the Jewish National Fund box, every Friday - pennies we couldn't afford. And I got my knowledge of Judaism the hard way - I didn't see any difference between a Jewish employer and a Christian employer, and we got very hard deals indeed from the Jewish end. We were on the Board of Guardians at io /- a week, and when my parents refused to do things they asked us to do they cut off the io /-, and left us absolutely destitute . . . Again, in going to Synagogue - I would go every night to shool , my father was dead and I had to say Kaddish. There were quite a number of people who came four times a year to Synagogue. When you got to the Yom Tovim it wasn't the poor man who came every day to shool to pray, it was the rich man who got all the honours. And as a child I said 'what sort of religion is this'? And so we had a simple application without all your rather - forgive me - high falutin' talk. I'd had enough of Judaism and I'd had enough of Christianity too. And so I moved away from religion, and I found in Marxism not a religion but something which seemed to be right. I thought in terms of bread, you see. A 6d to us meant the difference between a meal and light, and darkness and hunger. You could put a penny in the gas, and you could buy things. And therefore most of us in the factory saw things in these terms ... we saw Judaism in this way, and it wasn't a joke, we really believed it - we believed that Rothschild before every Yom Kippur would run a horse and that horse would win, and therefore the whole workshop 37 would put money on Rothschild's horse because he was running it, and it would lose . . . (laughter). Now the last thing on earth I want to do is to be hostile, but I want if I can to show you that we had quite a different approach altogether. I was in the unemployed marches, I was in the East End of London fighting Moseley when he tried to march through. All of us were involved in it, and that was our practical way of Marxism. We didn't see it in a philosophical sense, although of course there is a very deep philosophical sense. But I never saw it in that way, we saw it in practical day-to-day work. Moseley was threatening the Jews, and he was threat- ening Socialism, therefore we fought him. And I was in the Jewish organisations (B'nai B'rith) and I was, I hope, a good Marxist at the same time. . . I again see that there are a number of very good aspects of Judaism, and a number of very bad aspects of Judaism. I would very much like to hear from you a number of the things about which I know nothing - I know very little about the philosophy of Judaism. Goldstein: Before Mr. Fagan spoke, we were talking in ideal terms. We were making the mistake of talking of the vision. The mistake that Mr. Fagan has made is to equate Jews with Judaism, just as I would make the mistake, no doubt, of equating any one particular communist or marxist society with the ideals of Marx- ism. And you've just been unfortunate - we all know - I was brought up in the same background as you - I was also poor. I also went to Synagogue and saw the rich given all the honours, and my family were just put in a corner somewhere. So you don't have to be a Marxist to have this kind of background, (laughter). . . I forsook Judaism for several years, and came back. But you see I think that one of the differences between Marxism and Judaism is that Judaism has an added dimension - that's the only way I can put it. The Marxist progress seems to me to be the individual in the</page><page sequence="9">Judaism and Marxism | First European Dialogue service of society, or in the service of the state. The ultimate goal of Marxism is the perfect society or the perfect state. It may even be in a sense a theological concept, theologising the state, or society itself. For the Jew, beyond man, beyond society, beyond the state, is a transcendent reality, is God. Man has almost infinite capacity, capability, potential, but this capacity must or should be realised in himself, in his own personal private life, in his spiritual life as well as his practical life, and through society, all these things must be re- alised in the service of God. The whole world is in the service of God . . . I can see that Judaism can embrace Marxism, can include Marxism, I can't see that Marxism can include Judaism. It goes beyond Marxism, and this is the extra dimension. Dunman : There is a fantastic ferment taking place, not only in this critical field which you mentioned, but in the religious field too. For instance, the changes which are now going on in the Catholic church, the tremen- dous discussions which are going on, the ferment that's taking place in the Protestant Church, the Bishop of Woolwich, and all old concepts being challenged. An entirely new world is developing. I welcome the changes that are taking place, I welcome the fact that we can meet and discuss here, I welcome the fact that we have had a dialogue now with Catholics. After all, a few years ago we were being anathematised. Now, all sorts of things are happening. Friedlander: There are basic Jewish traditions you should know. Thus - the whole concept of the dignity of labour and the nature of the labourer. The book of Ruth, for example shows that the poor are not to be handed charity; they have the right to work. When fields are tilled, no matter whose field, a certain portion of the field belongs to the poor. There are certain basic things in their franchise which cannot be taken from them 38 - even the struggle in terms of the institution of slavery. Messianic times almost have to break through periodi- cally : in the seventh year of Release, and the fiftieth Year of Jubilee. There was always this insistence that the order of things is not to be accepted as ultimate, that rulers as such are not sacrosanct, that there is an appeal to the laws of God before which all are equal. There is, throughout the Bible, the attempt to strive towards that equality. It provides far stronger indict- ments of religion than you would find in any Marxist writings. You have the prophets pointing out that feasts, sacrifices, are despised, that justice, righteousness are the ways in which religion must manifest itself. All of that tradition can be affirmed and welcomed by you. And what you have in the Bible is elaborated in Talmudic legislation, and comes down to the present day in terms of the utterances of teachers and rabbis . . . Klugmann: Marxism has been accused of many things in this discussion - that it is 'just a protest' (which is incorrect) - that it is 'pass√©' but Dr. Maybaum says the opposite: it is too victorious! whether one likes it or not, and admitting that within Marxism there are trends and currents and discussions and strong pole- mics, I think it would be strictly untrue to say that it was pass√©. Because the phenomenon of the world, for better or worse, depends on one's own point of view. Marxism is under discussion, in advanced countries, underdeveloped countries, in west and east, (interrup- tion - so is Fascism). I wouldn't have thought so. I would profoundly disagree that Fascism is attracting as an influence hundreds of millions of people all over the world, in the way that Communism is or Marxism. I would say that if it was, the attraction of Fascism would be a disaster, and the attraction of Communism would be an advance. I think that's a red herring, personally. Maybaum: What do you make of the Fascism within</page><page sequence="10">Communism? They are both totalitarian systems . . . Klugmann: Well, perhaps we could come back to that, because I think this is a word-play. Goulston : The Czechs are not protesting against the philosophy - they want freedom. Klugmann: But they're not protesting against Fascism. But I think that the strength of the appeal of Marxism is precisely that it is more than a protest. For many people Marxism starts as a protest; that's to say, very many people, working-class and intellectual, who move in to protest against their environment, or against the society in which they live, that is their point of entry into Marxism. But Marxism takes them further, and that is the strength of Marxism. Dr. Maybaum is quite wrong in two ways to speak of the ultimate goal of Marxism being a perfect state. Marxism, I think, starts with the individual and ends with the individual, in so far as it ends at all. The second, fallacy, concerns the ultimate, because the thing about Marxism, and in this I know we can't always be accused of being modest, but in this we are more modest than some - is that we don't have an ultimate aim. We don't think we can know the end. We do have a picture, a vision, of men and women in society, overcoming their class divisions, overcoming probably their national divisions, but in perpetual struggle with their environment, and with nature, with always new problems arising, not with some final ultimate day on which you can say that man has now arrived at his destiny, man has now accom- plished his mission, the struggle now ends. Rayner : We share a common concern for what we might, for convenience sake - call justice. Then we can do one of two things, and probably we should do both. One is to go forward and examine in detail what our concept of justice entails, in terms of society and the individual. The other is to go backwards and see what assumptions about the nature of man our concept of 39 justice rests upon. I would have thought those two would be the most useful directions. Maybaum: To find out all these things, we have to de- mythologise Marxism. Marxism can still be a myth. Many people believe in Marxism as other people be- lieve in eternity or that science can do everything. I look at the wireless, I've not the slightest idea how it works, but I believe that science is capable of doing the trick. In this way people believe in Marxism, or have believed in Marxism, or still believe in Marxism. And if that is so, Marxism has become a myth, and we have to de-mythologise this myth, and see what is right and wrong, what can be preserved, what is the centre of this myth. The Marxist calls religion a myth, and con- tradicts religion with science, he forgets that science is also a myth. Lewis : You see, when we say we all agree about justice - of course we do. We all agree about the sacredness of human personality - I don't think this is a real ground for agreement. Because Marxism is a historical theory, in other words it is concerned only with justice as it appears in actual present concrete social and historical situations, but what does it mean today in relation to what is going on in this country, concretely? And we might find, you see, that we could work out abstract principles of what justice means, of what its origin is, what its principles are, what human nature is, and so on, then walk out of this room and do opposite things. Do contradictory things. I was looking at television the other day and I saw two American pastors walk out onto the tarmac in their white trousers and shirts with a huge black cross on their chests, to bless the bombs going off to bomb Hanoi. Now these two pastors if they were here, they would agree with us about the sacredness of human personality, they would agree with us about justice, they would agree with us about all these things, but they walked straight</page><page sequence="11">Judaism and Marxism | First European Dialogue out onto the tarmac, and Thumbs up, and God bless you, boys,' and the sign of the cross when the bombs go off. . . Friedlander : Often in the criticism of religion. . . You feel that we make an appeal to an extra human deity which cannot be sustained - but is there not an appeal to an absolute system or programme in Marxism? And on the way to a better world, do you not demand of the individuals involved a certain surrender, and an accep- tance of a dialectic that may be a more cruel deity than the one you accuse us of believing in? Klugmann: Only if we completely pervert it. But what I'm saying, and what Marx himself said was that this understanding must be impressed upon us by the objective situation . . . Maybaum: Let me ask you a simple question. And believe me, sir, I ask it not as a controversialist, but in humility, and I ask myself first what I ask you now. My question is, why is Marxism today dead? (laughter). No, you see there is no doubt about this. Has it some- thing to do with the end of Western philosophy? Is there an answer? Klugmann : Yes, an answer. One thing I note in common between supporters of Marxism and Judaism, they find it much easier to start than to finish! Until the whole socialist system in the Soviet Union and in China and over the whole of Eastern Europe falls in ruins and returns to capitalism, Marxism is not dead. You may anticipate this, you may wish it. It hasn't come about. Marxism is embodied in a socialist world, as long as it stands, Marxism stands. Marxism is not a theory. . . Rayner: There is a similarity of concern, between Jews and Marxists, which does not necessarily apply for all ideologies. There are other ideologies which lay the primary emphasis on something other than the amelio- ration of human life collectively and individually, such as faith or ritual or something else. I think it is worth 40 recognising that Judaism does make ethics, individual and social, something primary, and that this does bind us together. I entirely agree that having said that we must go on to explore in detail what the implications are, but when it comes to that I would have thought that one must look at both the application to political issues and the underlying ideas and ideals, and if the two can't really be separated, and if I may break my own rule and say something about Marxism, I wouldn't have thought that it was not only a political program- me but also based upon fairly definite ideas about man, human nature, human history, and society and so on. The two I would have thought need constantly to be looked at together . . . Klugmann: I would like to go on meeting. . . to discuss the Jewish and Marxist view on man, his potentiali- ty. . . the future. . . Israel. . . other topics. Goulston: If our steps were faltering and uncertain, they are the faults of being the first ones, and if passions were engendered I think this is part of the raw expe- rience of meeting unaccustomed ideas for the first time. The one thing that strikes me about the whole Marxist position, and certainly our own, is that within them both there is the element of striving. As far as I'm concerned, striving is a religious category. So I hope that on that note we could end our discussions today and look forward to their resumption tomorrow . . .</page></plain_text>
