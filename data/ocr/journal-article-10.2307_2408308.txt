<plain_text><page sequence="1">EVOLUTION OF MATING PREFERENCES' ELIOT B. SPIESS Department of Biological Sciences, University of Illinois at Chicago Circle, Chicago, Illinois 60680 Received Received June 23, 1980 For more than 20 years, Peter O'Donald has de- veloped in various papers genetic models of sexual selection, particularly involving discrimination by one sex (usually females) between genotypes of the opposite sex (usually males) in the acceptance of mates. In this new monograph he sets forth numer- ous genetic models in logical sequence, mostly from his papers, as a guide for analysis and interpretation of real instances of sexual selection in natural or ar- tificial populations. By so doing, O'Donald clarifies and makes more secure an aspect of Darwinian se- lection about which much has been written and dis- cussed in recent years from a theoretical or obser- vational viewpoint (optimality arguments, for example) without "a genetic model connecting cause and effect." To answer questions of whether mating preferences can evolve, the conditions under which they may evolve, and how efficient preferential mat- ing is either alone or as a supplement to what Darwin called natural selection (relative survival, longevity, and resistance to disease, for example) requires mathematical working out and computer simulation of genetic models. This monograph includes helpful starting points for further analysis, and the models given should be reckoned with before embarking on optimality arguments or further discussion of mating systems evolution. Much of the book represents an expansion and elucidation of Fisher's theory of sexual selection and the evolution of mating preferences based on the se- lective advantage gained by females who could dis- criminate between males and then accept for mates those males with high fitness traits. It is not intended as an exhaustive, all inclusive treatment of behav- ioral details or populational instances of sexual se- lection. Certain simple assumptions are made at the outset, followed consistently into logical avenues, possible mating patterns, and evolutionary outcomes described. If readers can devise other assumptions about the mechanisms of behavior between the sexes as to how mates are chosen, they should well con- sider these O'Donald models as a likely framework from which to start and within which interpretation may be satisfactory. The first chapter includes an historical outline of the ideas about sexual selection beginning with Dar- win, the unfortunate misinterpretation and criticism from J. S. Huxley in the 1930's causing an eclipse of the theory, but reinstatement after 1950 with exper- imental verification and culmination in the publica- tion in 1972 of the symposium papers (edited by B. Campbell) celebrating the centennial of Darwin's publication. Examples of competition among males for mates, territoriality, display, and female choice of mate are documented briefly in the second chap- ter. To this reviewer, terms such as Darwin's "sexual selection" and Huxley's "epigamic selection" are use- ful as short-hand metaphors of referring to those as- pects of the organism's life cycle during which mat- ing and fertility are expressed; otherwise these terms are unjustified as separable from natural selection by which we now refer to any differential relative con- tributions of genotypes to progeny generations. Cer- tainly mating efficiency is part of the life cycle con- tinuum within which competition for mates and fac- tors that promote the union of gametes are relevant components. Chapter 3 sets forth the basic mating models from which Chapters 4, 5 and 6 expand the genetic con- sequences for a simple system of one locus (A-a) con- trolling a trait in males towards which females may 1 Genetic Models of Sexual Selection.

The symbols are rea- sonable and consistent; but some of the writing is repetitive when each preference model is restated before going into the genetic model; the algebra is heavy so that solutions take time for the reader to check, once understanding of the model has been achieved. Nevertheless if one is familiar with selec- tion models in population genetics, there is sufficient explanation to follow the argument. These chapters are organized into three main models which are used throughout the remainder of the sections on evolu- tion of such systems, namely as follows: 1) Complete preference (C) model. Two kinds of fe- males exist in the population: those that mate only with the males they prefer and those that mate randomly. Females with constant preferences would thus search indefinitely until they find the male preferred. Females without preferences al- ways mate at random. 2) Partial preferences (P) model. Females with con- stant preferences search a group of n males; if they fail to find the preferred type they mate with the next male (n + 1) regardless of his genotype. Alternatively this model can be interpreted as the number of courtships (encounters with any male) needed in succession to reach the mating thresh- old. 3) Frequency-dependent positive (PF+) or negative (PF-) model. The amount of preference is ex- pressed by females in proportion to the frequency (positive) of encounter (or incidence) with a pre- ferred type of male or alternatively in proportion to 1 - frequency (negative) of encounter (or in- cidence). Relationships between these models are shown: for example, the PF+ model is equivalent to C when increasing n to infinity; if preference parameters for each type of male are equal in the PF - model, it is converted into the C model, and so forth. Data from experiments (such as those of this reviewer and oth- ers) are fitted to these models, analyzed for goodness of fit, and interpretations made for most likely pa- rameters and models. O'Donald treats systems of monogamous mating (long term pairing) in Chapter 7 (based on his 1974- 76 papers plus those with J. W. F. Davis on the Arctic skua). Territory size and relative time before mating and reproduction are the relevant parameters for these systems in addition to the preferences as- sumed under polygyny. Early matings tend to be the preferential ones, and fertility (reproductive success) tends to be higher among earlier than later matings. Comparison with polygynous mating as to conditions for genetic equilibria and rate of change indicates that monogamy tends to be the slower process. Assortative mating is rightfully defined as a dis- tinctly separable system, at least theoretically from the more general preferential mating (sexual selec- tion); and Chapter 9 is set aside as an expansion of the genetic model, following the paper by Karlin and O'Donald (1978), together with an illustration from the experimental literature on phenotypes of the wasp Mormoniella. The key Chapter 8 (after dispensing with Zahavi's far-fetched theory of preference for handicapped males) concentrates on computer simulations of se- lection progress under various models of male trait genotypes (A-a) and female preference genotypes (B-b). Rates of change for the preferred (A-a) geno- types are usually faster under sexual selection (pref- erential mating) than under natural selection (rela- tive survival) of a comparable intensity. Sexual selection can spread deleterious traits and balanced equilibria may result. The outcome is nearly always frequency dependent irrespective of whether pref- erences are held constant or not; thus stable poly- morphism can often be maintained by mating ad- vantage of male phenotypes. Linkage disequilibria evolve, with recessive preferred traits producing a higher level of association between alleles for pref- erence and those for the preferred trait than with dominant traits. Thus the simple assumptions made by Darwin, Fisher, and now O'Donald with regard to preferential mating can account for a number of genetic consequences that are observed for popula- tions of sexually reproducing organisms. There are at least two reservations, however, which the reader would do well to recognize: first, preference parameters are conjectural and the real behavioral mechanism to account for observed pop- ulational changes may prove the term "preference" to be misleading or wrong; second, given preference as real, an attempt to fit data to a model necessitates a more complete knowledge of genotype performance in experimental or natural populations than has been possible heretofore, so that predictions of genetic equilibria and their stability may be hazardous. On the first reservation, it has turned out from further experimentation by this reviewer that a likely be- havioral explanation for the Drosophila minority male mating advantage, cited by O'Donald from the work of Petit, Ehrman, and Spiess, comprises nei- ther preference by females nor sensory habituation (Spiess and Kruckeberg, Amer. Natur. 115:307-327, 1980). Female Drosophila melanogaster (and no doubt other species of this genus) tend to avoid the type of male first to court. Thus when two types of male occur in unequal numbers and if both types court about equally, the more numerous type tends to court first, is avoided when the female accepts a male in mating, and the minority type mates pro- portionally more than it would by chance. In con- trast with sensory habituation which necessitates nu- merous encounters (two or more males with identical signals), avoidance behavior would follow from a single encounter. O'Donald's preference parameter could be interpreted as a constant attitude on the part of certain females (those with "discriminatory ability") leading to the avoidance of the male type first-to-court. Whether that discrimination is a con- stant (in the complete C model, the partial P model) or frequency dependent (PF -), it is not yet possible to say with certainty. O'Donald's Table 6.2 is a</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 1229 guide, but obviously objective description of dis- criminatory ability is required before the best model can be assigned to this system. On the second reservation, fitting the data from Drosophila pseudoobscura AR and PP arrangements (Spiess, Amer. Natur., 1968, 102:363-3 79) indicated that the partial (P) preference model (with n = 3) was the best but the calculations led to an unstable equilibrium for those arrangements. O'Donald had assumed zero preferences for heterozygotes; however, the experimental data cited did indicate that heterozy- gotes (AR/PP) displayed a slight minority advantage. Thus the model would have been more realistic if it had accommodated the heterozygotes and would have indicated a stable equilibrium. Finally, we might excuse the author a few cases of anthropomorphism in statements about expecta- tions on how females may react to males' courtship; after all he is not presenting a treatise on behavior. For example, on page 31, "Males whose courtship is more vigorous and intense produce more sexual stimuli: they will more rapidly raise a female's level of stimulation, and thus elicit her response." The reader will no doubt interpret that statement as im- plying that females will mate faster with courtship by the more active males; in fact, however, this re- viewer has often observed the opposite, namely that Drosophila females usually refuse to mate for a long time when courtship intensity is greater than an op- timal level. Consequently this book can be valuable with respect to genetic models; but with respect to behavior the reader will do well to remember that behavioral assumptions are made as necessary for considering likely parameters in the models, not for indicating exact behavioral explanations.</page></plain_text>
