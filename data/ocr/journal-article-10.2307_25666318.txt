<plain_text><page sequence="1">62 SUMMER FIELD WORK OF THE OKLA HOMA ARCHAEOLOGICAL SALVAGE PROJECT James B. Shaeffer Summer field work of the Oklahoma Archaeological Salvage Project consisted of some surveys in the Oklahoma highway system, all of which proved negative, and 4 weeks of excavation on the Fort Sill Mili tary reservation supported by Park Service funds. This latter was a follow-up of a survey conducted under Park Service aus pices in cooperation with the U. S. Army Artillery and Guided Missile Center Mu seum. During that time about 117 sites were located and a number of these re commended for excavation. This summer a few of these sites were tested. Unfortunately, it was found that during the interval since the survey and the time when additional funds were available, some of the best sites near the post had been destroyed by construction and engi neering projects. On the other hand, 1 significant site was uncovered by such ac tivity. The most productive site, one along East Cache Creek about 2 miles south west of the main gate, was located in a grove of large oaks along the stream. Site features consisted of half a house cir cle (30 feet in diameter) having posts at 2-3 foot intervals and several hearths, one of which was 3 feet deep. Artifacts were recovered from within the house circle and immediately adjacent to its exterior. These consisted of small tri angular and side-notched points, a few dart points, turtle-back manos, a slab me tate fragment, punctated and grit tempered plainware sherds. A quantity of buffalo bone, some shell,and assorted flint and rock de bris were recovered. About 2 1/2 miles north on Medicine Creek just before its confluence with East Cache Creek an entirely different type site was uncovered during borrow pit oper ations of the Post Engineers. Here, although no features except hearths could be located because of the depth of the overburned (a bout 5 feet) and previous destruction by machinery, sufficient material was found to indicate an occupation of an earlier per iod. Buffalo bone, for instance, was en tirely lacking at this site. While deer pre dominated, it was augmented by box tur tle, rodent, fish and mussel shell remains. Pottery sherds were cordmarked or plain with gravel and bone temper. Manos were quite abundant but few scrapers or points were found. Some house wattle was found indicating a wattle and daub-thatch type of dwelling construction but the ground plan of the latter remained unknown. Several other small ubiquitous sites were tested. One along the north bound ary of the reservation, to the east of Blue Beaver Creek, resulted in the recovery of some handstones, a chopper, a knife, and several Gary type dart points all of which in material and typology were re miniscent of a local phase of the Lawton Aspect. Along the north and south banks of Medicine Creek in the vicinity of the bluffs several large stone features (possi bly house floors) were uncovered which suggested disturbed anthropomorphic shapes with a central hearth. Below Medi cine Bluff a 15 foot house circle devoid of associated artifacts was excavated within an occupation area from which tri angular and side notched points were re covered.
