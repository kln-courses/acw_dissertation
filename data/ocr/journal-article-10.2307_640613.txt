<plain_text><page sequence="1">Histories and Subiectivities GEOFFREY M. WHITE n the course of writing this introduction, issues of history and mem- ory have been constantly present in daily reporting about interna- tional crises such as Kosovo and Timor, as well as in seemingly endless articles about past wars from World War II and the Holocaust to Korea and Vietnam.1 As Americans and others seek to understand the nature of distant conflicts that may have only a tenuous relevance to their own experience, journalistic reports often try to make sense of these conflicts by invoking narratives of culture and history. A case in point is a New York Times article on the Yugoslavian conflict with the timeless head- line, "Two Distinct Peoples with Two Divergent Memories Battle Over One Land." The article goes on to say, "The conflict between Serbs and Albani- ans, currently embodied by the sight of Albanian families desperately flee- ing Serbian pursuers in Kosovo, has a very long history that is deeply felt, if selectively recalled, by those condemned to live it" (Kaufman 1999). The term memory, long the focus of popularized Freudian theories, now marks public theorizing about collective histories "selectively recalled." Media fascination with conflicting histories, especially national histo- ries, is paralleled by a rise in interest in historical discourse across the social sciences and humanities. These interests are indexed by increasing references to concepts of "collective memory." This term was associated at midcentury with Durkheim's student Maurice Halbwachs (Coser 1992), but is now used more widely (Bloch 1996; Bodnar 1992; Funkenstein 1989; Gillis 1994; Linenthal 1995; Nora 1989; Sturken 1997; Watson 1994). Indeed, so much work has been produced under the banner of memory studies of late that the term collective memory is suffering from semantic overload (Klein 2000). Nonetheless, the concept continues to be useful for its ability to cut across oppositions of history/memory, psychology/culture, and in- dividual/society. As Sperber (1975) noted in an early article about the relationship between anthropology and psychology, studies of memory of- fer a critical arena for researching relations between public and personal representations. Yet, Durkheimian dualisms of individual-psychology ver- sus collective-culture continue to exert strong influence. For example, as Ethos 28(4):493-510. Copyright ? 2001, American Anthropological Association.</page><page sequence="2">494 ? ETHOS John Eidson notes in his article "Which Past for Whom? Local Memory in a German Community during the Era of Nation Building" (this issue), An- tze and Lambek, in their recent volume Tense Past, admirably seek to complicate this binary by examining "the interplay between individual and collective memory in practice." In doing so, however, they presume to be concerned with two "kinds of memory," individual and collective (1996:viii, emphasis added). The concept of collective memory complicates these oppositions in interesting ways. It does so by focusing attention on connections between personal memory, narrative practices, and larger social and political for- mations. The papers collected here, drawn from anthropology, linguistics, and psychology, explore these connections through studies of discursive practices that people use to create and interact with representations of the past-representations that often bear personal significance as well as so- ciopolitical consequences. The dichotomous opposition of individual versus collective memory has been sustained by long-standing disciplinary paradigms separating the realms of the psychological and social. On the one hand, historians, politi- cal scientists, and others concerned with history as dominant or official ideology generally avoid questions of historical consciousness or subjec- tivity.2 In contrast, psychologists and others interested in the ways indi- viduals understand their own history usually approach memory as a cognitive and emotional process, with little attention to the larger social and institutional contexts of memory (but for important exceptions, see Neisser 1982; Wertsch 1994b). The papers in this volume are concerned with interconnections between these spheres, focusing particularly on dis- cursive practices that link personal identities with larger imagined collec- tivities. The insularity of disciplinary approaches to individual and collective memory is particularly evident in work on "life history"-one of the most enduring items in the anthropological tool kit. The routinization of the life history method is evident in grant proposals, research reports, and publi- cations of all kinds that make repeated references to "collecting life histo- ries," just as one might collect genealogies. Because of its apparent simplicity and portability, the life history method-eliciting an account of a person's life through direct interviewing-has tended to insulate life his- tory work from research on narrative practices in public and institutional contexts. Whereas research on life histories has generally proceeded through one-on-one interviewing out of ordinary contexts, work on collec- tive histories has more often focused on key texts and contexts in which dominant or authoritative histories are created and circulated. Despite this routinization of methods, life history research in recent years has been complicated by interpretive and poststructural theories</page><page sequence="3">Histories and Subjectivities * 495 that emphasize the importance of language, discursive practice, and social context in the production of narrative (Briggs 1986; Crapanzano 1977; Hanks 1996; White 2000). Awareness of the importance of the means of representation for life histories is reflected in a shift in language. Many of those working on life histories now talk of life "stories," indicating greater awareness of the representational practices (storytelling, interviewing) used to construct self-accounts (Linde 1993; Peacock and Holland 1993; Rosenwald 1992). For psychologists and others accustomed to the study of memory as individual cognition, discussions of collective memory may verge on the metaphorical. Is any act of cognition about the past an act of remember- ing? Obviously not, since people regularly interpret representations of his- tory without prior knowledge of the events concerned. Indeed, the reason that public representations of the past are critical foci for ethnographic interest is that they are sites of interaction between texts and interpreting subjects, including speakers and their audiences. Each such interaction yields distinct interpretations that emerge in dialogic interplay among di- verse forms of knowledge, textual forms, voices, and interests-an insight identified with Bakhtinian theories of language and cognition (Bakhtin 1981). To anthropologists, the spate of recent writing on collective memory may seem puzzling for its familiarity. Work in the area at times reinvents approaches to culture and identity commonly pursued in ethnographic research on narrative, ritual practice, life histories, and so forth (White 1999b). After all, mythology, oral histories, local legends, and the like have long been analyzed for what they say about social identities, visions of the past, and the limits of community. Similarly, commemorative rites, me- morials, and, more recently, museums, are routinely studied as sites for the production of cultural memory (Karp and Lavine 1991; White 1997). Yet, much of this work has approached historical narrative as a text that can be read in a straightforward way, as a kind of window into temporal consciousness. For the studies that follow, however, communicative prac- tices are of interest not as a means of expressing prior cultural meanings but as acts that actively create the past, or at least create the past as un- derstood and felt by social actors within particular social and historical circumstances. By taking a discourse centered approach, these papers locate their objects of study in public arenas where meanings take shape in relation to their contexts of production, including the interests and desires of people involved (this concern with context is shared with current approaches in linguistic anthropology; see Duranti 1998). By situating memory in histori- cal and institutional contexts, narrative representations can be seen to be embedded in wider fields of textual and social significance. The studies</page><page sequence="4">496 ? ETHOS that follow argue that avowedly collective histories frequently take on both personal and sociopolitical relevance, mediating subjective worlds and so- cial realities. The claim is that public constructions of history are inevita- bly discourses of identity. Beginning with the observation that historical narrative is a powerful and possibly universal medium for representing who "we" are in relation to others, these studies examine practices that, in representing collective pasts, also work to constitute cultural subjectivi- ties. The "history" discussed here is largely self-conscious history; stories about the past are constructed in public spaces that are at once objects of community interest and deliberate efforts at self-fashioning. Historical narrative not only represents who "we" are in relation to others, but who "we" are in relation to ourselves through time-past, present, and future. This interest in discursive formations of identity resonates with Ben- veniste's (1966) view that subjectivity depends on a speaker's ability to posit herself or himself as a subject in language. In his view, subjectivity emerges through dialogue and the performative and indexical properties of language. "Consciousness of self is only possible if it is experienced by contrast. I use I only when I am speaking to someone who will be ayou in my address. It is this condition of dialogue that is constitutive of person ..." (cited in Crapanzano 1982:193). Although focused narrowly on pronomi- nal usage, this dialogic perspective may be extended to narrative practices generally and to the manifold ways in which communicative acts create subject positions linking speakers (or authors), texts, and audiences (real or imagined). NARRATIVE PRACTICE The concern with discursive practice or "mediational means" in these papers focuses particularly on narrative forms and practices. Narrative can be studied as linguistic form, as cognitive process, and as discursive practice. As Linde (1993) notes, the use of the term narrative often de- parts from the more specific definitions applied by linguists that assume a linguistic structure representing a temporally ordered sequence of events. Thus, Linde observes, Lyotard's examples of "master narrative," such as the Enlightenment master narrative, are in fact not narratives at all, but a kind of value hierarchy associated with particular historical epochs or mo- ments. Nonetheless, identifying such value orientations, loosely con- nected with a sense of history, can be quite useful in identifying the contexts within which more specific narratives are produced. In contrast, stories about a nation, a person, or a company (such as those discussed by Linde) may in fact be analyzed in terms of their linguistic and semiotic dimensions.</page><page sequence="5">Histories and Subjectivities * 497 In whatever guise, narrative has generated an enormous amount of interest across the disciplines (Bruner 1990; Miller et al. 1990; Mitchell 1981; Ricoeur 1984; White 1981). In cognitive and pragmatic terms, the temporal structure of narrative, its basic sequentiality, provides a means for thinking and talking about causality and about linkages between past, present, and future. Such linkages create connections with wider fields of social and political significance that give historical narrative much of its moral and emotional power. As Hayden White and others have long noted, the use of cultural forms of agency and emplotment to represent historical events renders past events as moral stories. Projected toward the future, these stories create an agenda for social action, making them a useful ve- hicle for nationalisms and social movements of all kinds. With all this it might be said that the ubiquity of narrative in language and everyday life render it unproductive as a focus for research. Yet, among the many communicative practices that calibrate time in ordinary interaction, acts of historical representation and interpretation stand out as particularly influential means for locating the self in cultural time. Al- though a great deal of writing on the anthropology of the self has taken an interest in cultural constructions of time (Hallowell 1937), most of the work in this area has focused on cosmologies, key symbols, ritual prac- tices, and so forth, without much attention to the social and political stakes of such constructions. Similarly, little attention has been paid to the pragmatic means through which subjective temporalities are created in everyday life and ongoing interaction. While all the papers in this issue discuss historical narrative, it is more accurate to describe their interest as concerned with narrativizing prac- tices. Narrativizing practices here are the discursive strategies that use narrative to render past events both comprehensible and persuasive. In producing, enacting, circulating (or simply consuming) stories of the past, social actors create and objectify the realities in which they live. Success- ful (or, rather, effective) historical narrative not only represents the past, it represents it as real, natural, important, relevant, and authoritative, often using metadiscursive means to do so. The cultural status or signifi- cance of historical narrative is established by a variety of pragmatic means used to index its value for a given speech community (something like this is implied in the concept of "entextualizing" discussed in Silverstein and Urban 1996). The studies that follow all analyze instances of historical narrative that repeat or renarrate well known events. As they are external- ized or enacted, then, they enter into dialogic relations with reigning dis- courses of history and identity (Bakhtin 1981). In his paper "Narratives as Cultural Tools in Sociocultural Analysis: Official History in Soviet and Post-Soviet Russia" (this issue), Wertsch dis- cusses narrative as a "cultural tool" that people use to accomplish their</page><page sequence="6">498 ? ETHOS purposes. Calling narrative a cultural tool points to the pragmatic work accomplished by historical discourse-cognitive, communicative, social, and political. Stromberg, for example, illustrates uses of narrative as a cul- tural tool in his study of Christian conversion stories which, as he shows, are used by evangelical converts to transform personal experience and produce more desirable representations of past and present realities. (Stromberg 1993). Psychologists have long observed that narrative forms enable comprehension and recall of complex information (Cole 1971; Ru- melhart et al. 1971). Stories create cognitive scaffolding that allows people to fill in unspoken assumptions and make connections to existing cultural schemata. Presumably it is through this type of cognitive expansion that subjects construct the relevance of stories for themselves by inferentially expanding their cultural and personal significance. But this sort of expan- sion-the work of "constructing the relevance of stories"-is not done in a vacuum. Rather, the active meaning-making of narrative practice is most often done in social situations with all the moral inflections and (mi- cro)politics of everyday life. In such situations, the task is not one of re- calling information for information's sake, but of creating meaning within a social ecology of meanings. I take this to be a central tenant of Vygot- skian psychology and practice theories that emphasize the pragmatic di- mensions of language in use (Edwards 1997). All of the papers in this collection are in some measure ethnographies of historical practice. While some are based on fieldwork in contemporary communities (Linde on an American insurance company; Matsuki inter- viewing Japanese citizens of the Pacific War generation), others work in a more historical mode examining texts and contexts through time (Eidson on the work of German "local historians" around the turn of the century; Feldman on debates between German and Jewish historians; Wertsch on Russian textbooks). All focus on specific kinds of narrative practice used to represent the past within particular social and historical contexts-the what, how, who, where, and when of narrative production. An ethnographic account of narrative practices, then, begins by in- quiring into local forms of narrative and their significance across contexts. Linde gives some idea of the scope and diversity of narrative resources for just one corporation when she describes the wide variety of resources mo- bilized by MidWest Insurance to tell its own history. Because the company focuses intensively on its past, it has created a "narrative rich" environ- ment for those who work in the company. Objects and activities devoted to narrating the company's history include a museum in the main lobby of corporate headquarters, photographs and plaques, pictures of present and past executives, pictures of outstanding agents, and numerous oppor- tunities for testimonials and recollections in training sessions and other meetings (Linde 1993).</page><page sequence="7">Histories and Subjectivities * 499 In addition to their concern with cultural modes of narrative practice, these papers also focus on the social organization of narrative. One hy- pothesis that emerges from these papers is that the most influential nar- ratives occur in situations and in media defined as significant for collective identity. To continue the example from Linde's paper, some of the most important (effective) instances of historical representation at Midwest oc- cur in training sessions where individuals regarded as "unofficial histori- ans" talk about the company's past in terms described by participants as "lively and humorous."3 Such occasions are critical sites for the acquisi- tion of company identity-as they should be given that they are set up as a means of socializing (training) new employees (Linde 1993). Another example of the social organization of historical discourse is that of the German local historians described by Eidson. By creating a specialized status, towns could authorize a person to work and speak in the voice of the community. To do this the town historian could "contribute features to local the newspaper, make public appearances, hold speeches, or pro- duce chronicles for Festschriften on the occasion of an important anniver- sary . . " (Eidson, this issue). These examples of the constitutive role of historical narrative can eas- ily miss the politics of memory that are always bound up in acts of histori- cal representation. Speakers and authors do not only use narrative to form conceptions of the past; they use narrative to transform, amplify, disrupt, or erase such conceptions, as produced in other narratives. In other words, as already suggested, narrative practice is always in dialogue with other texts and voices (Wertsch and O'Connor 1994). Each act of representation is also an act of recontextualization in which familiar objects and events are potentially given new meaning by virtue of their association with new circumstances and new historical moments. Just as Pacific villagers who hold meetings to discuss social conflicts use narrative to build new, more desirable interpretations of conflict and its attendant feelings (Watson- Gegeo and White 1990), so narrators of history everywhere work to create and transform social and emotional realities. In this collection, papers by Matsuki on Japanese war memory ("Ne- gotiation of Memory and Agency in Japanese Oral Narrative Accounts of Wartime Experiences") and by Feldman on German historical debate ("Dialogue and Its Discontents: Thirds, Acting-Out, and Working-Through in the Broszat-Friedlander Exchange of Letters") focus on just these kinds of critical transformations or "negotiations" accomplished through narra- tive practice. Matsuki's informants, selected on the basis of their genera- tional identity as Japanese citizens who lived through the Pacific War (members of the Showa generation), use narrative to make sense of rup- tures in national narrative and in personal histories caused by cata- strophic defeat in war. In Matsuki's analysis, these individuals engage in a</page><page sequence="8">500 * ETHOS "narrative process of meaning negotiation" to reposition their present selves in relation to their wartime selves, as well as to the nation, then and now. The fact that the Showa generation's personal narratives of war are markedly absent from public contexts for representing the war suggests a degree of conflict between Showa experience and dominant national nar- ratives that depict the war as an aberration, a moment to be forgotten or built over by postwar democratization and economic growth. Similarly, Feldman characterizes an exchange of letters between the historians Broszat and Friedlander "as an effort to ultimately confront the trauma of the Holocaust" (this issue) In her analysis, all parties to the debate were concerned with German national identity and with narrative trajectories that would "give it new strength" and reclaim a damaged na- tional persona. The debate in this case, involving professional historians, links different modes of historical representation-different historiogra- phies-to the question of German subjectivity. The historical practice All- tagsgeschichte concentrates on normal life (which may be studied anthropologically) and thereby "implies a split of reality between the con- text of living of 'regular' people on the one hand, and perpetrators and victims on the other." Here the power of narrative emerges as problematic, as a ready-made vehicle for creating public memory that, by renarrativiz- ing the past in prewar Germany, displaces or suppresses anxieties associ- ated with the Holocaust. In these cases, as in others, the form and content of narratives are enmeshed with the contexts where they are put to use. In particular, ten- sions between public/nonpublic contexts emerge as critical for narrative production and comprehension. This is a major theme of Wertsch's analy- sis of history textbooks in his discussion of Russian histories (this issue) and elsewhere (compare Ahonen 1992 with Wertsch 1994a). His work shows a marked awareness among citizens about varieties of history, es- pecially involving contrasts between official texts and more informal counter-discourses. These analyses suggest that the fall of communist states that had tightly controlled official representations of national his- tory caused a break in historical practices analogous to that created by defeat in war. In both cases, lines of identification or resistance between personal and national identities must be discursively transformed and re- adjusted. In each case, the social significance of national identity is (re)imagined on the basis of public discourses of the national past. NATIONAL SUBIECTIVITIES Nationalism and national identities, a major interest of 20th century social science, have gradually become central topics in anthropology. As paradigms for working in small-scale "bounded" societies have dissolved,</page><page sequence="9">Histories and Subjectivities * 501 issues of making and resisting nation-states have attracted increasing an- thropological interest. Much of the recent anthropology of nation-making cites Anderson's (1983) approach to the nation as "imagined community" as a compatible framework for anthropological analyses-no doubt be- cause of its constructivist approach. In doing so, however, most of the work on the anthropology of nationalism, at least since the mobilization of anthropologists during World War II, has bracketed problems of national subjectivity. Whether out of a Foucauldian sense that subject positions are created in discourse or a more basic reluctance to psychologize political formations, anthropology has had little to say about the forces that shape national selves and sentiments. The result, however, has been a distinctly impoverished area of theory that might otherwise concern itself with na- tional identities as sites for the production of personal and emotional meaning. There is broad agreement that narrative, especially historical narra- tive, is a central means for nation-making (Kelly 1995). The papers col- lected here suggest that there is much to be learned from looking more closely at the stories that make up the "imagined communities" of nations. Four of the five papers focus on some aspect of national narrative-making. The paper that does not, Linde's study of MidWest Insurance, demon- strates a number of parallels between the ways "the company" creates a sense of collective history among its employees and the ways nation-states do the same among their citizens. Parallels across these cases suggest cer- tain generalized means for forming collective identities through narrative practice. One of the premises of structuralist theories of society, from Evans- Pritchard to Levi-Strauss, is that identities depend upon relations of con- trast and opposition. These oppositions in turn frame the contexts for creating or "negotiating" national identities. As most constructivist theo- ries would have it, identity, whether ethnic, cultural, or national, is always contingent on social and historical forces of various kinds. In other words, collective identities are always "in the making." Indeed, the identities dis- cussed here appear more as possibilities-as moments of "arrest" in a spectrum of possibilities-than anything fixed or homogenous (Crapan- zano 1990). As Eidson (this issue) puts it, "Exploring the conditions under which variable forms of collective memory are sustained or reemerge within the supposedly homogenizing discourses of state-governed societies is, argu- ably, an important but neglected task." In his article he shows that the significance of German local identities of place evolve in counterpoint with emergent national identities, as well as with changing political, economic, and demographic conditions (cf. Bodnar 1992). Here the local and the national emerge in dialogue with each other, formed in particular historical</page><page sequence="10">502 * ETHOS moments according to the problematics of the time and available means of representation. It would appear that local and national histories are readily renarra- tivized to update their relevance for changing social and political circum- stances. As an example, Eidson describes the German historian Kreuzberg as rewriting the history of "town square neighborhoods" in a fashion that reconciled their origin stories with a larger vision of Germanic identity ("ancient Germanic origins of local traditions," (Eidson, this issue). These revisions of history had the further effect of producing a "common national essence" as a prototype for later German nationalism as well as projecting "all apparent conflict into a realm located outside the community" (Eid- son, this issue). In displacing lines of conflict outside the local/national community, these German histories are similar to the official Soviet his- tories described by Wertsch. The latter, it seems, achieve a kind of sym- bolic purification by highlighting the subversive motives and actions of European powers interfering in Soviet conflicts. The genius of nationalism is that, as "community" it is dispersed and remote while at the same time capable of evoking strong emotions and mobilizing collective action. These papers examine this question by asking how personal stories connect (or fail to connect) with national narratives. Although hardly a nation, MidWest Insurance, as described by Linde, pro- vides important examples. The company, regarded by many employees as a place for developing a personal and moral style of interaction in the workplace, acquires much of its significance in opposition to the specter of faceless capitalism assumed to be more typical of the industry as a whole. In this context, as Linde (this issue) notes, personal stories play a critical, pragmatic role. Stories that work to personalize the past have the potential to (re)produce local and individual meaning in the context of large, impersonal corporate interests. Indeed, much of the mystique of Linde's "MidWest Insurance" company is represented precisely as coun- terdiscourse set in opposition to the "company from nowhere" (Linde, this issue). IDENTIFICATION Whether a neighborhood, a nation-state, or a corporation, collectivi- ties are not only objects of imagination; they are also objects of interest and identification. The greater the perceived relevance of collective histo- ries for personal lives, the more likely they will be infused with interest and emotion, and, conversely, the more life stories will be regarded as tokens of collectivity. In addition to the obvious role of the power of the state, how do stories acquire relevance? As we know from studies of offi- cial histories in former socialist states, state power itself is no guarantee</page><page sequence="11">Histories and Subjectivities * 503 of perceived relevance, and may as likely evoke resistance and skepticism (Ahonen 1992). How, then, do certain stories acquire significance for personal life worlds? Narratives may be good to think, but how do they become relevant and moving? The flip side of this question is to ask, as Linde does, how do stories (and institutions) acquire memory and emotion?4 Linde answers this question by proposing the concept of "narrative induction." In narra- tive induction, "a person comes to take on an existing set of stories as her own story" (Linde, this issue). The papers that follow describe a variety of strategies useful for appropriating collective histories as one's own. Of course, narrative is just as likely to be used to resist, reject, or disavow history as it is to embrace it. The general point is that historical narrative, in context, works to remake or reposition the self in relation to collective identities and the stories, texts, and voices that represent them. In the classical sociological theory of Talcott Parsons, the relation between individual lives and collective histories might be articulated in terms of the interplay between individual psychology (motives, personal- ity) and collective representations (culture). In a Parsonian world, indi- viduals are socialized by internalizing cultural meanings and values. The concept of internalization describes a process whereby the stuff of culture "out there" gets replanted inside the minds of individuals and thus ac- quires emotional valence. But given the poststructural break with defini- tions of culture as something already given in fixed public representations, posing questions about the relation of collective representations and per- sonal stories artificially dichotomizes opposed spheres of individual/col- lective, internal/external, and private/public.5 Another liability of the internalization metaphor is that it directs attention away from obverse questions such as, "How do some personal stories become collective sto- ries?" or "How do they get externalized?" with all their attendant issues of power and domination (White 1992). Another way of asking these questions is: How do collective histories interact with personal, life histories? As awareness of the embedded qual- ity of life history interviewing has deepened, researchers interested in in- dividual lives have broadened their scope to attend to modes of talk and institutional contexts within which people recall and represent life expe- rience (Desjarlais 1997; Personal Narratives Group 1989; Smith and Wat- son 1996). Through this kind of widening, work on individual histories has become increasingly concerned with the contexts of collective history- making (for example, O'Nell 1996). In what ways do life histories enter into dialogue with other historical forms and voices, whether of families, places, ethnicities, or nations? For the authors here, the conceptual building blocks of collective iden- tities are personal narratives-stories that (re)contextualize experience in</page><page sequence="12">504 ? ETHOS ways that resonate with larger histories. Personal stories emerge over and over as "cultural tools" that connect (or disconnect) the personal and the collective lives and histories.6 In what ways are these connections achieved? What are some of the personalizing rhetorics that do this kind of narrative work? One of the most common strategies is the use of historical narrative as allegory, giving identity categories emotional meaning on the basis of close-up stories of specific characters, actions and events (White 1999a). Many histories connect persons and collectivities using what might be called a "collectivity-in-the-person" strategy. Like heroic histories, these stories represent collectivity as embodied in the person and actions of specific individuals, such as political leaders or ordinary citizens whose actions embody idealized values of the collectivity. The most well docu- mented example described by Linde (this issue) is the founder of MidWest Insurance, Mr. McBee. In such cases, the person's identity as a member of the collectivity-whether leader or ordinary person-frames his or her life story as an allegory of collectivity. The experience of an individual, then, can be narrated as an exemplar of the collective. When so represented, personal qualities and actions become signifiers of collective ideals. Acts and intentions become tokens of collective agency. Narrative forms also facilitate the personalization of imagined com- munities by depicting the collective past with narrative forms and prac- tices used to represent more concrete personal actions (White 1990). The narrative forms of ordinary language build concepts of agency, intention- ality, and emotion into historical discourse. "The nation" and "the com- pany" become anthropomorphic actors with their own intentions and life histories. Moments of war and revolution, for example, may become mo- ments of life transition, of birth, maturation, death, and so forth. There are abundant examples of this sort of collectivity-as-person, from the Soviet "collective personality" depicted in Cold War official histories to images of the idealized insurance agent portrayed in training sessions at MidWest Insurance. The reproduction of certain stories in a variety of contexts and media is a necessary element of collective memory-making. Through repetition such stories become prototypical or, in Linde's terms, "paradigmatic." They also become powerful by virtue of their significance as markers of the collective. Prototypic stories, then, play a role both conceptually and politically in the construction of social realities. On the one hand, they provide a cognitive apparatus for conceptualizing the past in specific, cul- turally constituted ways. On the other, they provide the practical means for stating, revising, and contesting the past. What does it mean when certain stories are told repeatedly, in a vari- ety of contexts? In the case of MidWest Insurance's company histories,</page><page sequence="13">Histories and Subjectivities * 505 Linde tells us that these are not only displayed in the company museum, but are also produced in convention shows, board games, Jeopardy-style quiz shows, and are "used as light relief at training and sales meetings" (Linde, this issue). The variety of discursive means used to create com- pany history reflects the fact that the company past is regularly reworked for a variety of purposes. Collective history here is anything but a totaliz- ing or hegemonic regime absorbed wholesale by members. The active agency of those interacting with narrative histories is perhaps most evi- dent in acts of resistance and appropriation, such as those described by Matsuki among her wartime interviewees or by Wertsch for consumers of Soviet histories. Recognizing the importance of the repeatability of historical stories suggests that greater attention be paid to the social life of narratives. How do they move around and gain renewed significance as they shift and mu- tate across contexts? The papers in this issue describe a wide range of narrative ecologies: from the proliferation of historical practices described by Eidson and Linde to the erasure of war narratives discussed by Matsuki. In somewhat different ways, the metadiscursive debates about history and historiography reviewed by Feldman and the contestations over specific genres of history discussed by Wertsch indicate that the history of histo- ries is a crucial dimension for work on collective memory. CONCLUSION In addressing problems of collective memory, historians find them- selves increasingly dealing with the constructed or semiotic dimensions of historical representation, much as an ethnographer would. At the same time, psychologists and anthropologists accustomed to examining history as a cultural or cognitive construction are increasingly historicizing their subject matter, putting culture in motion and tracing histories of memory through changing political and institutional circumstances in the fashion of historians. The articles in this issue further complicate this traditional division of labor. The starting point for narrative analysis is the recognition that public histories tend to be self-consciously constructed and interpreted. Yet, one of the insights to emerge from this confluence of interests is that historical narrative derives its power from conceptual and political forces outside the realm of awareness. In focusing on the interplay of history and subjectivity, one is lead both inward to conceptual and affective bases of historical representation, as well as outward to historical and institutional contexts. It is the spaces in between, and the processes that constitute relations between persons and collectivities, that are of particular interest.</page><page sequence="14">506 ? ETHOS Understanding the "spaces in between" leads, methodologically, to a focus on discursive practices which, used in context, give narrative under- standing social significance (Kenny 1999). Whatever the source and authority of narrative histories, it is their voicing in particular contexts, in relation to other texts and voices, that affords an opportunity to study their significance for persons and communities. Wertsch, in his discussion of narrative as a cultural tool, makes this point by emphasizing the need to examine both the consumption and the production of historical texts. His point is consistent with the audience-oriented thrust of recent strands of interpretive theory, from hermeneutics to semiotics and media studies, that meaning does not in- re in texts, but rather is an emergent achieve- ment of interaction betw mn people and texts (or, more precisely, texts- in-the-making). Historic; texts, whether in print, visual media, or an ethnographer's interview ,rotocols, cannot be regarded as windows onto cultural meaning, waiting to be decoded by those who command wider or deeper frames of local knowledge. Cultural analysis of historical narrative and its subjectivities inevitably leads beyond the text (and beyond con- scious meaning) to transit back and forth between cognitive/affective proc- esses on the one hand and institutional/historical forces on the other.

I would like to thank Tom Csordas and Janis Jenkins for conversa- tions, criticism, and encouragement that have made this special issue possible. A collection of essays that aims for diversity in disciplinary approaches could not be done without the support of editors willing to take risks. In addition to the contributors to this issue (including Lindsay French whose work on the fragmentation of memory among survivors of Cambo- dian genocide, has influenced this project), I would like to thank Robert Desjarlais and Ther- esa O'Nell, whose recent collection on "The Pragmatic Turn in Psychological Anthropology" (1999), published in this journal, has been an important forum for developing and extending a discourse-centered approach to "history and subjectivity." 1. James Wertsch begins an introduction to a volume on historical representation with, "As I write this in 1993, the world is full of conflict over history. In the former Yugoslavia, Serbs often justify the atrocities they are carrying out against Bosnian Muslims on the basis of their need never again to be defeated as they were in the Battle of Kosovo in 1389" (Wertsch 1994a:247). 2. One of the theoretical developments that has expanded the interest of historians in memory is the recognition that history, like its more subjective counterpart "memory," is always mediated by representational practice. In other words, history making, like remem- bering, is entangled with language, context, and discourse (White 1990). As Hanks writes of spoken histories, "The telling of history is filtered through the genres in which it occurs. Like writing, reported speech, and other metalinguistic operations, it is a form of objectification.</page><page sequence="15">Histories and Subjectivities * 507 It ... takes place in a present context whose own contours inevitably shape the result" (Hanks 1996:269). 3. The fact that portions of these narrative events are even framed, ironically, as "ser- mons" is indicative of the complex use of genre and communicative frames to create a de- sired context for interaction-in this case solidarity among participants. The element of humor further calls attention to the importance of pragmatics for interpretation, suggesting that "history" in such situations is not likely to be taken at face value. 4. As an example, Linde describes one manager's comment that "I don't come by it (com- pany values) by blood" (Linde, this issue). In other words, she had to learn. Such comments reveal an awareness of self as connected to collective identities through specific cultural knowledge practices. 5. See Strauss and Quinn (1997) for an attempt to reclaim the notion of internalization (or "internalized schemas") without entirely stripping away social-political contexts of cog- nition and the transformative role of mediating practices. 6. Linde makes a useful distinction between "nonparticipant" narratives in which the speaker is herself not a participant in the events recounted. An important contrast here is between nonparticipant narrative and personal narrative. However, this distinction can be- come quite complex in cultural modes of speaking in which a speaker may inhabit the iden- tity of significant others (such as ancestors), thereby adopting a subject position quite different from that of the ordinary self in ordinary speech.
