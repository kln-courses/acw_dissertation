This must be encouraging and indi- rectly beneficial to those from many smaller countries where the outlook for the disci- pline sometimes seems uncertain. Though Phoenix is rather outside the normal U.S. conference circuit, this was said to be as well attended as any previous annual meet- ing, despite the recent reorganization which prompted the major American associations of physical anthropology and archaeology to hive themselves off- though the AAA still includes sections devoted to these sub-disci- plines, a 'general anthropology' division, and some twenty semi-autonomous societies united under the AAA umbrella. The meeting took place in two downtown hotels and lasted for four and a half days, with about 1,900 papers delivered as well as many film screenings and round-tables. At certain times in the history of the AAA, quality seems to have given way to quantity, but now a high overall standard is reached through impressively efficient scheduling and advance planning. This leads unavoidably to a certain rigidity but means that one can plan to take in many sessions during a day in the reasonable confidence that the published times of papers etc. will be observed. Some of the sessions, which normally last for two to three hours with 15 to 20 minutes allowed for each paper, are highlighted as 'Invited Sessions', which is equivalent to a rosette in the Michelin Guide and presumably attracts a higher attendance. At the other extreme are 'Anthropologica Miscellanea'-five quarter-hour discourses with no common theme-and 'Brief Reports on Recent Research'-eighteen, yes eighteen, five-minute sound-bites presided over by the selfless Mario Zamora (William and Mary). Specially important scholars are allowed to bend all the rules and give proper lectures. For instance, Lawrence Stone the controversial British historian (Princeton) gave a virtuoso account of a family row among the 18th century English squirearchy, culminating in fratricide and three hangings-all minutely documented in matrimonial and criminal court records, and surpassing any fiction of the period in its gory and juicy detail. (It is easy to see how a scholar of his pugnacious style is drawn to this data.) Stone argued against the neo-Marxist interpretation of English law as purely a means of social control: showing that a baronet convicted of murder had his corpse exhibited after hanging, as a public demonstration that-in principle at least-all were equal under the law. In implicit dialogue with feminist accounts of the period, Stone said his case-study showed that young women of property could be sold by their parents under marriage contracts as if they were chattels, but a married woman had considerable freedom to travel, carouse, make love, and run up debts for her husband. A husband's most chilling sanction over her was the threat to confine her to a private lunatic asylum. Stone said that historians in Britain, France and America had been recently more influenced by social anthropology than by any other social science, and especially by the work of Evans-Pritchard, Victor Turner, Mary Douglas and Geertz-invocation of whose account of the Balinese cock-fight has become a kind of grace before the meal in the prefaces to fashionable history-books. In a later session, he expressed pleasure in finding that among the younger generation of anthropologists, there are much more direct relationships with history than he was aware of, to the extent that the two disciplines are almost coming to meld in some fields such as the study of Mediterranean families. In any case, he considers that the passionate love-affair between anthropology and history is now settling down into a more clear-sighted companionate marriage. A second lecture in the session on 'History and Anthropology: European perspectives' was given by Carlo Ginzburg (Bologna and UCLA) on his analysis of church inquisitorial records in Bologna, which detail not only verbal exchanges but also the defendants' gestures, blushes, silences. Such 'archives of repression' have already been used by Le Roy Ladurie but Ginzburg has chosen an urban milieu rather than a village, and treats the texts more as a 'distorting-glass' than as an open window. He says that sometimes the most useful moments in such texts-useful in helping the historian to catch fears and emotions-are those when the inquisitor does not seem to understand the defendant's motivation. Ginzburg thought the anthropologist might have more in common with an inquisitor than s/he might like to think. From the floor, it was asked whether this meant that those ethnographers who misunderstand the societies they study may bequeath to historians more valuable material than those who do a good job. Ginzburg admitted that in conducting this research, he felt an unwished-for sympathy with the inquisitors as gatherers of information, in conflict with his feelings for the defendants whom he would like to be able to use influence to free, as a contemporary anthropologist might have the satisfaction of being able to do. James Fernandez (Chicago) said in response that anthropologists can become historians, but not vice versa. However, historians' deprivation of interlocutors can make them capable of a remarkable insight and expressivity. Anything to do with interpretation, rhetoric or narrative attracted the crowds this year. So much so that I cannot report on one of the more intriguing sessions -'Interpreting interpretative anthropology'-because des- pite the all-star cast, including James Boon, James Fernandez, Laura Nader, George Mar- cus, Terence Turner, it was crammed by the organizers into one of the small rooms named after Indian tribes-the Sheraton-Ha- vasapai-instead of one of the ballrooms, so that those who arrived even at the correct time had to cluster in the passage round the door like bees around a hive. I did however hear most of a rather similar session on 'Unveiling agendas: person and power in the creation of anthropological knowledge'. Among the papers was one by David Napier (Middlebury) showing how early anthropologists' interest in dance and trance in Bali led to these elements in Balinese culture first being seen by later anthropologists as central to Balinese religion, and then being 'played up' by the Balinese themselves. Other speakers insisted that anthropology must be much more egalitarian than it used to be. It is no longer possible, even if it were desirable, for anthropologists to claim special authority through distantiation: everyone is now reached by the mass media. James Clifford (UC-Santa Cruz) spoke of the need to 'reappropriate' such terms as science and objectivity which have been so thoroughly relativized. Dennis Tedlock (SUNY-Buffalo) criticized this move, by one of the masters of ethnographic hermeneutics, as appealing to a kind of neo-conservatism-and I was indeed reminded of the reaction to conservative values that the contemporary art-world experienced in the mid-1970s after fifteen years of deconstruction of art by the avant-garde. But Clifford said he was a jacobin, believing that science and revolution must go together-science being a contested field rather than necessarily on the side of the powerful. Barbara Tedlock (SUNY-Buffalo), commenting on the literary-critical approach to ethnography, reeled off a huge list of anthropologists who had explicitly rather than latently engaged in the writing of fiction or drama. By the way, it is not 'in' for ethnographers to talk about their 'informants' or even 'collaborators' any more: they should be called 'characters'. 22 ANTHROPOLOGY TODAY, Vol. 5, No. 1, February 1989</page><page sequence="2">I played truant on the final Sunday in order to do fieldwork among the State of Arizona's magnificent anthropomorphic saguaro cacti and at the Frank Lloyd Wright shrine at Taliesen West-feeling guilty at not attending 'Current Trends in Swedish Anthropology' which was scheduled for Sunday afternoon, though in the event it was cancelled. This presages a decision by the AAA to encourage more regular presentations by national anthropological associations: next year it will be the Dutch. I do not have enough access to the arcana imperii to know how this welcome to a non-American tradition came to be chilled by scheduling at such an unsocial hour, when the lobbies are blocked by suitcases and a sadness of fin de saison begins to set in. In fairness to the Program Committee, they have an impossible job, and one knows that the top AAA brass have a wretched time themselves during the annual meeting, being confined to windowless committee rooms for interminable administrative meetings and getting little of the extraordinary stimulus which the meeting can provide for the other ranks. I was also sorry to miss, through attending other sessions, those devoted to Native Americans and the South-West. There was however a plenary session on sovereignty issues for American Indian Tribes which provided up-to-date information on current negotiations with State and Federal governments over questions of recognition. To balance a failure of staying-power at the end, I did attend earlier the one and a half day pre-meeting on visual research, organized by the Society for Visual Anthropology. This now well-established fixture is an opportunity for longer papers to be given, with time for discussion and for videos, films and photographs to be shown. A kind of polarity seemed to arise between the approaches of Thomas Blakely (Brigham Young) and Drid Williams (Sydney). Blakely, a follower of Birdwhistell and Edward T. Hall, practises what he calls 'informant-guided micro-analysis' of personal interactions captured on film: in this case, an incident of dispute and reconciliation in a central African village. Drid Williams, an Oxford-trained anthropologist who formerly ran a dance studio in New York, eschewed all visual aids except her own body which she deployed imposingly and with great effect to enact some points about Australian Aboriginal dance. Blakely is guided by a McLuhanesque conviction that the new research media such as video are worth pursuing for their own sake, and will cause new research problems to emerge, very much as new medical technology such as CAT scanners have done. Williams adopts a traditional humanist view that technology must be kept strictly in its place. This polarity between the certainties of the body and the promises of technology is a fairly basic one. John Adair, the veteran ethnographer of the Navajo who helped produce the pioneering film Through Navajo Eyes in the early 1970s, came up with the persuasive insight that the Navajo Indians-in common with other previously non-literate societies such as the Inuit and some of the Brazilian Indians-are taking to video in a big way, thus leapfrogging the whole stage of literacy. Anthropologists (one might add) like Leach and Jack Goody have long argued that the importance of literacy may already be declining in Western societies too. But Adair's concern is simply that anthropology will be missing out badly if it does not adapt itself to new audio-visual technologies in its relationship with non-literate or recently non-literate societies. The most intellectually sophisticated session I heard was 'Memory and Exchange: Social History through Narrative and Objectification', a well-attended gathering with most of the papers by Melanesianists; the organizers were Debbora Battaglia (Mount Holyoke) and Susanne Kuechler (Johns Hopkins). The theme seemed to be the whole elusive question of transmission of identity and values. Steven Feld (Texas-Austin) gave a fine exposition of Kaluli mourning songs from Papua New Guinea, using a 'triangulation' of musicological, semiotic and indigenous concepts, with illustrative tape-recordings. Marilyn Strathern (Manchester) analysed the reaction of Hagen highlanders to some incidents during their first contact with the Leahy goldmining brothers. The high point for me was Alfred Gell (LSE)'s contribution as a discussant, in which he related Titian's late masterpiece 'The Flaying of Marsyas' to current theories of deconstruction and creativity, and to the Hageners' possible fear, when one of the Leahy brothers removed his hat, that he was about to flay himself. Gell traced as a common theme in the various papers the human need for immortality. He criticized some of the speakers for refraining from introducing Western philosophical models of memory and perception, and for affecting to rely on indigenous models as if their own Western cast of mind could be wished away: Gell prefers to borrow ready-made models such as those of Husserl and Bergson, rather than reinvent the wheel. He saw many of the speakers as trying to speak evocatively of evocation, and not always succeeding: it should also be possible to speak precisely about evocation. The other speakers seemed to me intent on an ever more refined anthropology, purged of ethnocentric impurities, a refinement exemplified in Marilyn Strathern's dialogue between feminism and Melanesian studies, The Gender of the Gift (JUSt published by California U.P.). Gell seems to retain deliberately a good quantity of base metal in his alloy, with a view to producing something more resistant to vulgar handling. I omit from this impressionistic account some papers whose authors may be publishing them in A.T.: Philippe Bourgois (San Francisco State) on the 'crack' economy in Spanish Harlem, Linda Jencson (Oregon) on neopaganism and witchcraft in the USA, Carole S. Vance (Columbia) on anthropology and sexuality-this last was part of an outstanding session 'Anthropology rediscovers sex' organized by Shirley Lindenbaum (New School for Social Research). Suffice it to say that whereas one of the popular images of anthropologists is that they collect strange sexual customs, in fact there was a long gap between earlier work by Malinowski, Layard, Elwin or Schapera and recent research by Herdt, Thomas Gregor and others. This is all becoming highly topical with the world HIV crisis. But I must try to summarize the Distin- guished Lecture given by Mary Douglas: 'The Hotel Kwilu: a Model of Models', which drew a huge audience and a standing ovation on the Saturday. The Distinguished Lecture is given as the climax of the week at about 10 p.m. after a full day's work, numerous parties and finally the presentation of eight awards for services to anthropology. Mary Douglas sensibly decided to abbreviate her lecture somewhat, so that some of the internal links were probably missing; these will no doubt be reintroduced when the lecture is published in the American Anthropologist. Douglas's manner was successively demure, delphic and devastating. She appeared to be interweaving several themes. One, favourably received by an audience sensitive to the incongruity of luxury hotels as a venue for anthropology, was a charmingly told story about her recent return visit to the Lele of Zaire, where she did her fieldwork in 1949-50 and 1953. She stayed one or two nights in a large airport-type hotel on her way to the Lele, but the electricity only worked when a guest put down ready cash to get the generator started, and the telephones and taps did not function. However, water was brought into her bath by unseen hands so that a degree of comfort was attained. This, she said, was 'a metaphor for almost anything': but particularly for structural-functionalism. Pretension was allowed not to lcfse face, through the continuing ministrations of women with buckets. Substantive external connections were minimal. This led Douglas to lament that anthropology does relatively little to engage in great debates with neighbouring disciplines that could, as it were, plug it into the public utilities. Since anthropology has successfully won its point that peoples formerly regarded as uncivilized are in fact very like 'ourselves', why does it not strive for a more prominent and effective role in such fields as economics, development theory, risk analysis? Why does it not do ANTHROPOLOGY TODAY, Vol. 5, No. 1, February 1989 23</page><page sequence="3">more to help peoples like the Lele, whose plight is now appalling on account of deforestation and neglect? Why are applied anthropologists made to feel marginal? If there is no centre how can you have a periphery? From here we moved on to an elaborate inverted analogy between the valuations given by the Christian West to the theological Other and to the anthropological Other. In traditional theology, Christ was the essential, positively valued, superhuman Other or +. In pre-twentieth-century anthropology, 'savage' peoples were negatively valued as spiritually wanting or-. Modernist theology and modernist anthropology (the latter following about a century later, and quite independently) set out to remove these respective 'signs'. Jesus's miracles were rationalized as having a natural explanation; likewise, 'primitive' practices such as witchcraft and magic came to be rationalized as fundamentally similar to scientific thought-processes. Jesus's life was demystified and redefined as myth; likewise, anthropologists like Leach set out to show that all history was myth. Alternatively, Jesus was just an ordinary man; likewise, anthropology argued that all supposedly primitive peoples have the full human attributes associated with language. All this was presented through an analysis of Albert Schweitzer's The Quest of the Historical Jesus, first published in English in 1910. I found this fascinating and up to Mary Douglas's highest standards. Some others apparently saw Christian apologetics lurking below the surface, I learnt later, and it was estimated that perhaps a quarter or a third of the audience were probably of Jewish rather than Christian origin. How provocative, I thought, to revive the memory of Schweitzer, once portrayed as a living saint in schoolrooms all over Europe and the USA, but out of fashion since Jane Rouch's article 'The Scandal of Lambarene', published in 1962, charged his hospital in Gabon with backwardness, lack of hygiene, and racism. Douglas is right however to draw attention to the brilliance of his early theological writings. (And within the context of his time, was not Schweitzer groping towards the kind of 'appropriate medicine' which anthropologists approve of in Africa today?) But just as I thought Douglas was getting into her stride and would bring her oration to a neat conclusion, she ground to a halt and we all stood up. I believe what she was striving against the clock to say was that Christian theology and the science of anthropology have a common problem in adapting to a new order in which otherness, whether + or -, has been flattened out; that there is a 'death of the savage' anthropology as there is a 'death of God theology'. I found time to drop in, earlier in the week, on an informal discussion between 'Christian anthropologists'. They turned out to be mostly missionaries and missiologists from the Summer Institute of Linguistics and similar groups. They referred to 'the Church' meaning the evangelical movement in its various forms. I had naively hoped to learn more about anthropology in America's Catholic universities (see A.T., Letters, April 1988), but apparently, in normal American speech, Catholics are not a subset of 'Christian'. The SIL has been subjected to heavy criticism by anthropologists in recent years, mainly for their activities in South America, but they have produced at least one major anthropologist, the linguist Kenneth (emic/etic) Pike, who is a dedicated supporter of SIL. Presumably they are allowed space and time at the AAA meeting as a minority interest within anthropology, and that is to the AAA's credit; but perhaps a clearer name for the group should be devised. Mary Douglas's preaching was well practised at the annual meeting by Steve Rayner (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) one of a small and scattered but interesting group of her former students-another being Michael Thompson-who have developed her ideas. Rayner's paper was called 'Risk management and the global commons: a cultural approach to decision-making'. He has developed Douglas's methods of analysing how social organizations constrain discourse, into a model for understanding the current debate about climatic change: the global warming which is expected to ensue from an increase in C02 emissions. The model suggests a fault-line in our thinking about the 'middle-of-the-road' position on environmental problems. The ideological middle-of-the-road is a commitment to sustainable development rather than the extremes of preventivism (not disturbing the balance of nature) and adaptivism, which would maximize extension of the benefits of industrialism to poorer nations. The scientific middle-of-the-road is the clinical mode of technical consultancy which falls between consensual applied science, where choices are straightforward and decision stakes low, and total environmental assessment where 'differences of opinion are clashes of world views' and decision stakes are high. But these two triads do not map neatly onto the three types of social institutions that Rayner identifies. Egalitarian collectives match closely with 'preventivism' and 'total environmental assessment', having 'a compressed institutional perception of historical time, a susceptibility to prophecies of doom, and a view of future generations as fragile and endangered'. But hierarchic institutions tend to favour 'sustainable development' for their ideology, and applied science for their method. This leaves the market-oriented institutions to act as brokers. They go for the clinical mode of technical consultancy; but ideologically, they tend to be adaptivist, so that the brokerage role does not fall to a middle-of-the-road ideology. The implication of Rayner's paper is that ordinary citizens may be more under the influence of adaptivists, presenting themselves as purveyors of compromise and good sense, than we are aware. He calls for experiment with new social forms. This line of thought follows from Mary Douglas's 1970 paper 'Environments at risk', which was her first brush with the conservation movement, and it answers some of the demands she now makes for 'connections'. Rayner's anthropology is very low-carat, but it is the judicious admixture of a little anthropological gold which gives lustre to what might otherwise be solid coin of the realm.
