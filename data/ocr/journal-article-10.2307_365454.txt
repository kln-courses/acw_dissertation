Perhaps he aimed too high; perhaps, too, the shifting sentiments in North America and Britain with respect to colonial administration (he was vastly perturbed by the situation in Massachusetts after 1770) played against him. He died before he had to make the great choice between loyalty to the crown and loyalty to the New World. Since he was an "establishment colonial," the choice would not have been easy. As it was, he was buried with full military honors in Trinity Church in New York; his bones rest among the elite of a world that was about to vanish. At the end, Bradstreet was given all of the honors he sought in life. This is an excellent analysis of the dilemma of the colonial. The research is thorough and the writing agreeable to read. The author takes one through the labyrinthine military politics of the eigh- teenth century with great skill, and a confusing subject is thus made very understandable. S. W.

By Jacques Barzun. (New York: Har- per &amp; Row. 1983. Pp. 344. $19.95.) Writing about William James's classic work on The Varieties of Religious Experience, Jacques Barzun laments to his readers that he can only "sample the feast." In reviewing A Stroll with William James, I am in a similar position, for seldom has a major creative thinker received such a rich, detailed, and correct evocation of the main facets of his thought. Barzun is a premier intellectual his- torian and an exemplary man of letters and culture. William James is his mentor in matters intellectual, philosophical, and even personal, so far as that latter term involves the religious ques- tion. Barzun's book is not another in the now steady stream of monographs on the thought of William James, many of which are characterized either by a desire to show where James allegedly went wrong on this or that isolated point or by an effort to explain what James really meant but never quite said himself. To the contrary, A Stroll with William James is written in the grand style: wide ranging, adulatory, critical in a helpful way, and, 126</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS above all, driven by a passion to share the majesty of James's thought with readers of every persuasion. Furthermore, Barzun is not only a careful student of James's writings but knows as well the writings of the father, Henry Sr., and of the brother, Henry Jr., both powerful and creative figures of the time. Barzun is also profoundly informed by the intellectual and cultural ambience of the world of William James, which he brilliantly limns in the opening pages of his chapter on "The Reign of William and Henry." So telling is his grasp of this context, that if someone were to ask me what it was like to live reflectively in the European-New England world from 1870 until 1910o, I would reply, "Read Barzun on William James." Barzun's "Stroll" is actually a voyage through the evolving thought of William James, with contextual asides that award nov- elty and originality to the now classic positions taken in the Prin- ciples of Psychology, the "Will to Believe," The Varieties of Reli- gious Experience, Pragmatism, and Essays in Radical Empiricism. Many other works of James's are cited throughout, and the reader soon grows confident that Barzun is familiar with the complete body of James's writings. In a book of this kind, it is appropriate that Barzun avoid scholarly philosophical tangles, although his use of the secondary literature on James is idiosyncratic, and it is to be lamented that he makes only passing use of the Harvard Critical Edition of The Works of William James, the introductions and text of which would have assisted and supported him in most of his positions. Barzun does not hesitate to take sides on a controversial issue, and it is refreshing to read someone whose interpretation is willing to acknowledge and absorb the resulting conflict. Despite his many strident opinions, Barzun is faithful to the spirit of James and twice cites James's proscription: "What has been concluded that we should conclude about it?" Central to Barzun's approach is the key line in James's thought, written but a year before his death, found in A Pluralistic Universe (1909): "Let me repeat once more that a man's vision is the great fact about him." More than any other commentator by far, Barzun has remained faithful to that vision. The William James who emerges in the pages of this book has two facets. First, I believe that Barzun is sentimental and hagio- graphic about James's personal character. James was genial but self-centered and abysmally ignorant of massive social inequities. 127</page><page sequence="3">THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY His public show against American imperialism does not absolve his cavalier approach to the Civil War, the Irish question, suf- fragettes, or his romanticization of the San Francisco earthquake. Edward Madden in "William James: Warts and All," an essay un- fortunately not used by Barzun, presents this less pleasant other side. Offensive naivete abounds, for instance, in James's famous essays "On a Certain Blindness in Human Beings" and "The Moral Equivalent of War," both of which are rhetorically impressive but gloss over the causes of the situation James laments. Another criti- cism, only somewhat historically anachronistic, can be leveled against James's description, in a letter to Henry, of his experience of delivering a memorial address in honor of the first black volun- teers in the Civil War, a war out of which William bought and which destroyed his two younger brothers. "The thing that struck me most in the day was the faces of the old 54th soldiers, of whom there were perhaps about thirty or forty present, with such re- spectable old darkey faces, the heavy animal look entirely absent, and in its place the wrinkled, patient, good old darkey citizen." In the course of his address, James never mentioned the end of slavery. Many more incidents could be cited: James's response to the death of his infant son, Herman; his insensitive treatment of his sister Alice; his petulance about the legacy to his brother Robertson; his feigned neurosis in the face of challenge; and his constant hypochondriacal complaints about pressure when, in fact, his teaching and familial obligations were minimal. Quite simply, James, like most of us, is a complex person, and his failings should have been acknowledged more completely by Barzun. Barzun, following the suggestion of James's student the late Horace Kallen, states that to understand James, we must realize that he was a "gentleman" and then cites Andrew Lang to the effect that "no gentleman ever consciously misrepresents the ideas of an opponent." In that respect, James certainly was a gentleman. Unfortunately, a gentleman, more often than not, has no clue about how it is with the masses. The paradox here is that although James did not understand the social forces that dominated the "public," individuals understand James. Actually, James makes more sense, to more people, for more reasons, and with less aca- demic trapping than any other American thinker. Barzun ac- knowledges this strength by reference to James's intelligible lecture style; I would add James's uncanny insight into the unusual and the personally precious experience of the uncommon. 128</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS On the second facet of his presentation, James's thought, Barzun is to be commended. Even more than in Ralph Barton Perry's too often ignored book In the Spirit of William James, Barzun cap- tures the philosophical vision that animated James. Both James's technical and the popular writings are detailed and analyzed, and Barzun, with his lucid and informative prose, is able to cull from James's most sophisticated philosophical positions cultural and intellectual ramifications that are as fresh to present inquiry as they were when first written. Although James was a philosophical maverick, who opposed most classical doctrines, Barzun's rendition of James's thought serves to assign it a permanent place in the "philosophia perennis," no matter the point of view from which that tradition is assessed. In religion, James was a passionate skeptic who leaned toward the existence of a troubled, finite God. For James, all is not well, for the power of the eternal is no match for the troubling, obdurate activities of the created human species. Despite being factually and experientially obvious, such a theology is scandalous. On this mat- ter, Barzun seems to agree. In metaphysics, James holds the world to be concatenated, that is, continuous, knit together; nonetheless, some of the knitted loops are tied at only one end, and there is "separateness to the end." Consequently, we experience continuity, after a fashion, but never unity or totality. The epistemological correlate to this version of reality is that we can never understand the world from any single point of view, so the meaning of the world is due as much to our meaning it as to its ineffable be-ing. The pragmatic test for truth, then, follows from such a scenario and only from such a metaphysics. Following James, if objects are mock-ups, whereas relations are real and affectively experienced, then to propose a truth is to await its consequences, that is, how the emergence of future relations sustains the claim. Lamentably, Barzun does not make the neces- sary extrapolation from the radically empirical metaphysics of James, for he does not sufficiently explore the full implications of this new doctrine of relations. Nonetheless, contrary to most com- mentators on James, including Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore, Barzun does understand that pragmatism is not a vulgar manipula- tion of the truth for personal and self-aggrandizing ends. Barzun correctly sees that James's pragmatism follows from his empirical description of the person as an interest-oriented organism whose 129</page><page sequence="5">THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY 130 evaluation of the world is as much dependent on outcomes as it is on description. Barzun's educated understanding of modern science is helpful on this issue, for he is not seduced by any classical coherence or correspondence theory concerning how the world "is" rather than how it "works." Responding rather to James, and therefore ignoring the jejeune assumptions that govern most con- temporary teaching of science, Barzun boldly acknowledges the anthropomorphic character of scientific inquiry, including its covert and patently pragmatic methodology. Jacques Barzun also is not taken in by the never-ending spate of silly and uninformed critiques of James's doctrine of "The Will to Believe." He knows too much of Nietzsche's thought to be so misled and recognizes, furthermore, that neither the conservative nor the radical thinker is pleased with James's position. Moreover, Barzun, from what he tells us throughout this book, also knows too much of how life is actually lived to be unaware that James is prescient in his diagnosis of belief, especially overbelief. James's position is clear. Given that we are trapped in a repetitive and defined en- vironment, the human task is to project possibilities beyond our present ken. As James writes in his crisis "Diary," we have no guarantee for these beliefs, and they may, indeed, prove to be counter-factual. The text of 30 April 1870 reads: "My belief, to be sure, can't be optimistic." Despite this disclaimer, however, James concludes the entry with the remark that life shall be built in "doing and suffering and creating." James, then, affords us the opW portunity of having one foot firmly planted and the other foot springing for the stars. This paradox is central to James, and it is to Barzun's credit that he both understands and accepts it. Jacques Barzun's book on William James is superb, the best com- mentary ever written on James. To be sure, there are blemishes. In addition to glorifying James the man, Barzun also badly mis- interprets the thought of Josiah Royce and John Dewey-a com- mon failing in followers of James, but Barzun should know better. Also, Barzun occasionally vents some spleen on contemporary issues, especially in footnotes. I find him mostly accurate, but the posture is olympian, as though, for example, the proletarians rather than the gentlemen are at fault for the collapse of the Amer- ican public schools. This is vintage James but bad history, and it mars Barzun's otherwise excellent performance. As I mentioned, one cannot "conclude" when dealing with Wil-</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS liam James. Still, allow me to match Barzun's choice of an apoc- alyptic text from James with a choice of my own. Barzun presents an edited excerpt from James's Pragmatism. The full text reads as follows: The scope of the practical control of nature newly put into our hand by scientific ways of thinking vastly exceeds the scope of the old control grounded on common sense. Its rate of increase ac- celerates so that no one can trace the limit; one may even fear that the being of man may be crushed by his own powers, that his fixed nature as an organism may not prove adequate to stand the strain of the ever increasingly tremendous functions, almost divine crea- tive functions, which his intellect will more and more enable him to wield. Some four years earlier, in 1903, in a "Notebook," James wrote: All "classic," clean, cut and dried, "noble," fixed, "eternal," Welt- sanschuauungen seem to me to violate the character with which life concretely comes and the expression which it bears of being, or at least of involving a muddle and a struggle, with an "ever not quite" to all our formulas, and novelty and possibility forever leaking in. Contemporary evidence, especially the increasing spectre of nuclear obliteration, renders James's warning, that in time we shall, by our intelligence no less, undo ourselves, powerful and poi- gnant. Yet, he also promises novelty and possibility. Which shall it be? We are in debt to Jacques Barzun for pressing upon us both the warning and the vision of William James. John J.
