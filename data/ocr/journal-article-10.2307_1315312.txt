<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Forty-Fifth Annual Convention of the Midwest Modern Language Association November 7-9, 2003 Hilton Chicago Chicago, Illinois Please bring this copy of the program with you to the convention. For 2003, the M/MLA welcomes as guests members of the Mid-Western American Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies Useful forms are now available online (www.uiowa.edu/tv mmla) and, for your convenience, at the convention's Registration Desk located on the Lower Level. The pre-registration and membership form will be accepted until Octo- ber 20, 2003, the deadline for making reservations at the Hilton. The paper request form entitles anyone paying the regular registration fee of $50 ($60 on site) to as many as twelve complimentary papers from among those available for advance distribution. Additional papers may be purchased for $1 each. The special session proposal form is also available together with the permanent section form, for those already looking ahead to St. Louis in 2004. So, too, is the membership form of the Women's Caucus for the Modern Languages/Mid- west, a reminder of the WCML's numerous convention sessions and special events each year. The Forty-Fifth Annual Convention 75</page><page sequence="2">GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING Advance Copies of Papers. Some section, associated meeting, and forum pro- grams will be given over to discussion rather than oral delivery of papers. Avail- able papers presented for discussion will be duplicated at the M/MLA office and distributed in advance of the meeting to pre-registrants who request them. Ses- sions that are expected to have papers available in advance are listed as such in the Program. Papers can be ordered via the website's paper request form. All per- sons who pay the $50 pre-registration fee ($60 on site) for the meeting are entitled to request advance copies of up to 12 complimentary papers. The M/MLA will mail out copies of papers for all requests received by October 15, 2003. After that date, copies will be held for distribution at the Registration Desk on the Lower Level of the Hilton Chicago. The M/MLA does not hold any copyright on papers duplicated for the Annual Convention. Papers presented at the Annual Conven- tion are not for quotation except with written permission of the author. Associated Meetings. Because of shared disciplinary interests, the M/MLA annually provides time and meeting space during its convention for the meeting of other organizations referred to in the program as "Associated Organizations." These meetings are open to all who are registered for the M/MLA Convention and display an identification badge. Associated meetings will be held this year by the following organizations: American Dialect Society, Asociaci6n Internacional de Galdosistas, Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment, Conseil International d'Etudes Francophones, Henry James Society, Society for Critical Exchange, Society for the Study of Midwestern Literature, Women in French, and Women's Caucus for the Modern Languages/Midwest. Business Session. The business session is open only to members of the Associa- tion. All members are invited to attend and to take part in the proceedings. All resolutions to be considered at the business session must be submitted to the Executive Director of the Association no later than October 15, 2003, so that they may be forwarded to the Committee on Resolutions. Child Care. Please contact American Childcare at 312-644-7300 or the Ameri- can Registry at 773-248-8100 for a list of bonded child-care providers. Job Interviews. Department chairs and job applicants are welcome to use the meeting as a convenient occasion for scheduling interviews, but the Association suggests that candidates and school representatives make plans in advance by exchanging information and setting up appointments through correspondence. (The M/MLA does not have sufficient administrative personnel to provide a facul- ty exchange system at the convention.) Governance of Sections. The forty-eight sections of the M/MLA are governed according to the "Revised Guidelines." In brief, the secretary of each section, to be elected at the Annual Convention, becomes its chair the next year. In order to establish a new permanent section of the M/MLA Annual Convention, members should propose a forum for approval by the Program Committee. After three con- secutive years of successful meetings of the forum, a petition for permanent sta- tus should be sent to the M/MLA Office for recommendation by the Program 76 General Information about the Meeting</page><page sequence="3">Committee and a decision by the Executive Committee. The petition should include a statement of purpose and the signatures of at least twenty current M/MLA members. Location of Meeting Rooms. All regularly scheduled meetings and events will be held in the Hilton Chicago. Please refer to the hotel floor plans on pages 87, 88, 89, and 90. Membership in the M/MLA.

Any M/MLA member may propose a topic for a forum or a seminar at the 46th Annual Convention in 2004 by completing and returning the forum proposal form, available online at http://www.uiowa.edu/N mmla/, at the Registration Desk at the convention, or by request from the M/MLA Office. Forms, which must be typed or computer generated, may be turned in at the Reg- istration Desk or mailed to Program Committee, M/MLA, 302 English-Philosophy Building, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242-1408. Forum topics submitted by December 15, 2003, will be announced in the M/MLA online call for papers. Publication of the forum topic proposal on the M/MLA web site does not indicate acceptance for inclusion in the 2004 Annual Convention. The final deadline for submission of forum and seminar proposals for the 2004 Annual Convention is March 1, 2004. In making its selection, the M/MLA Program Committee will take the following into account: thoroughness of proposal, originality of contribution, and balance and diversity of the total Annual Convention program. Availability of meeting space will determine the total number of sessions that can be included, though all members are welcome to submit their proposals. 78 General Information about the Meeting</page><page sequence="5">Midwest Women's Caucus of the Modem Languages Events 2003 M/MLA Convention A Reading by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni Thursday, November 6, 8-9pm, Mobley Room sponsored by the Women's Caucus for the Modern Languages/Midwest and the Women &amp; Children First Bookstore Nightcaps cash bar to follow Women &amp; Children First Book Exhibit Northwest 2 A wide selection of feminist-related books and materials Women's Caucus Sponsored and Supported Panels: "Dance &amp; Sing, Get Up &amp; Do Your Thing": 20 Years of Madonna" (double session) Friday, 8:30-11:45 a.m. (Lake Ontario) "Chicks Rock: Women in Rock" (double session) Friday, 2:15-5:30 p.m. (Lake Ontario) "Our Individual Classrooms: Active Feminist Pedagogies" Saturday, 8:30-11:45 a.m. (4H) Membership Meeting Sunday, November 9, 7:15-8:15 a.m. Learn about the Women's Caucus and our plans for St. Louis Coffee and light fare will be available.
