<plain_text><page sequence="1">VII.-NEW BOOKS. Studies in General Ph,ysiology. By JAQUES LOEB. 2 vols. Pp. 782. The Decennial Publications of the University of Chicago, sec. series, vol. xv. 1905. IN these two volumes Prof. Loeb has brought together thirty-eight selected papers previously published in various periodicals, mostly German. The volumes thus contain the inost important contributions to general physiology of this very original worker. "A single leading idea permeates all the papers of this collection, namely, that it is possible to get the life-phenomena under our control, and that such a control and nothing else is the aim of biology." Comparative physiology has been for some decades unduly neglected by almost all the leading physiologists, who have concentrated their attention upon human physiology and have kept in view chiefly its relations to humnan pathology and medicine rather than the general problems of biology. Prof. Loeb's brilliant experimental researches in comparative physiology are therefore specially valuable at this time, because they are awakening a widespread interest in the more general problems. The most important papers of this collection deal with three topics: (1) the tropisms of animals, (2) heterordorphosis, (3) fertilisation of egg-cells. The papers of the last group report experiments in which Prof. Loeb succeeded in inducing developinent of the un- fertilised eggs of sea-urchins and worms up to an advauced stage by means of chemical and physical treatment. The most interesting fact .about these experiments is that their success seems to prove the reality of the author's insight into some of the chemical and physical conditions of growth, because it was achie'ved not merely empirically, but by the aid of theoretical considerations. The same is true, in much smaller degree, of the experiments of the second group. These consisted mainly of very simple manipulations by means of which the author succeeded in in- ducing worms and sea-anemones and other such creatures to develop new heads or mouths or tails in various unusual positions. The author is inclined to regard the constancy with which any such result follows -the appropriate treatment as evidence of a long step made towards the mechanical explanation of life-phenomena and as a heavy blow to neo- vitalism. But to me at least the experiments seem to render any con- ception of the morphogenetic forces less, rather than more, possible. So long as each organ is believed to develop only in its appropriate relations with the rest of the organs of the body one can imagine a certain segregation of particles of like functions (call them gemmules or by any other of the many new names for this old conception) and reciprocal determinations of neighbouring groups. But if, as these experiments seem to indicate, every part is capable of developing any kind of structure and undertaking any kind of function if only suLbjected to the -appropriate stimuli, these vaguely helpful coiiceptions must be rejected, and we stand more helpless than ever before the mysteries of growth,</page><page sequence="2">420 NEW BOOKS. differentiation and heredity. The conclusions drawn from the experi- ments on the tropisms of animals challenge criticism most loudly. The author tells us: "I have tried to find the agencies which determine un- equivocally the direction of the motion of animals " and that " I consider a complete knowledge and control of these agencies the biological solu- tion of the metaphysical problem of animal instinct and will ". His, experiments seem to prove that some lowly animals almost invariably move towards the principal source of light parallel to the direction of the strongest rays, more particularly of the visible rays of short wave length, while others have the opposite tendency (positive and negative helio- tropisms); that others tend to mount against gravity (geotropism), and others to keep their bodies in contact with surfaces or edges of solid bodies (stereotropism). Two or more of these tendencies are combined in some creatures, and the author jumps to the conclusion that all the movements of these animals are unequivocally determined by the physical agencies that play upon them, that " by the help of these causes it is. possible to control the 'voluntary' movements of a living animal just as securely and inequivocally as the engineer has been able to control the movements in inanimate nature. What has been taken for the effect of 'will' or 'instinct' is in reality the effect of light, of gravity, of friction, of chemical forces, etc."; that "however complicated they may be, the ' voluntary' movements of animals are nevertheless, . . . always unequivocally determined only by such circumstances as determine alsa the movements of bodies in inanimate nature ". He regards not only " will " but also " instinct " as mystical conceptions. Yet if we regard an instinct as a congenital disposition of the nervous system which deter- mines a certain mode of reaction to certain stimuli, the conception is. purely material and might be thought acceptable to the crudest ma- terialist. But Prof. Loeb is so blindly zealous to reduce the living organism to the plane of the billiard-ball that he grudges any credit to the struieture of the organism. He should remember that even the billiard-ball only rolls because it is round, and that its path across the table is determined not wholly by the cue and the table but also by its own structure and properties, and that in a similar manner, even if we hold by psycho-physical materialism, we must regard the movements of aniinals as determined not unequivocally by the physical impressions. made upon them, but as reactions upon those impressions, of which the form depends largely upon the structure of the animal and especially of its nervous system. The author asserts that he has proved the helio- tropism of animals to be identical with that of plants, and concludes that, since plants have no eyes and nervous systems, therefore the eyes and the nervous system of the moth have nothing to do with its flying into the candle flame, and that this occurs merely because its protoplasm is. positively heliotropic. The conclusion may possibly be true, but the reasoning is certainly false. By parity of reasoning men gather round the fire on a cold evening merely because their protoplasm is positively heliotropic. The author does well to deprecate some of the extremely anthropomorphic interpretations of the behaviour of lower animals, and if he contented himself with descriptions of observed effects he would be in a strong position; but lie makes positive denials of the psychic life even more reckless than the assumptions in regard to it which he com- bats. Doubt is thrown upon even his more legitimate conclusions by some of his own observations, e.g. of nothing is he more positive than that movement toward the light is a direct unequivocally determined effect of the light on the protoplasm of animals, yet he himself describes an experiment (p. 54) in which a number of ants seemed to become</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS. 421 positively heliotropic only through imitation of others. His off-hand treatment of psychological questions is well-illustrated by the following passages,-" The worms lack associative mnemory and consequently also consciousness, which is only a function of the former. By associative memory we understand that arrangement of the brain by virtue of which a stimulus brings about not only the effects corresponding with its nature and the specific structure of the irritable tissue, but also the stimulating effects of other causes, which at a previous time once affected the organism at the same or almost the same time with the stimulus." "Whether the sensations of pleasure and pain are possible without consciousness cannot be absolutely decided." W. McD. The Anatomy of Knowledge: an Bssay in Objective Logic. By CHARLES E. HOOPER. London: Watts &amp; Co., 1906. Pp. 226. Price 3s. 6d. The author of this book has no lack of self-confidence: 'IKnowledge being quasi-organic,' he tells us in the preface, ' the philosophic analysis of knowledge may be appropriately regarded as concerned with the anatomy of knowledge. I shall venture to trace a parallel between the philosophy of the past and the pre-natal state of the organism; also between the post-natal state and that of the philosophy to which all earnest thinkers aspire, and at the birth of which I have the ambition to assist' (p. 14). Whether the author's philosophical equipment is equal to his ambition to excel in philosophical midwifery may well be doubted. The very analogy between the growth of knowledge and the growth of a human organism seems little better than a piece of ingenious trifling. To call the ' least item of knowledge,' viz. a thought in its relation to the object thought about, a knowledge-cell; to compare the sciences to the different organs of the body, and certain fundamental principles present in all sciences to the ' vascular system of arteries and veins, and the nervous system, with its afferent and efferent branches,' is but an idle ' spielerei,' throwing no light on the real nature of knowledge or on those funda- mental problems with which the author attempts to deal. The author's own philosophical standpoint is not -easy to indicate, because it does not seem altogether self-consistent. The following positions appear to be essential to what he calls 'objective logic': (1) The distinction between 'object-matter,' i.e. that about which we think, and ' subject-matter,' i.e. the thinking itself and the various ' symbols' (language, etc.) by which it is carried on. (2) Truth is the correspon- dence or ' symbolic reference' of this subject-matter to some real object- matter. (3) Real object-matter has a distinction of place, time, and kind from its corresponding subject-matter, and thus reality 'transcends' knowledge. If, on the other hand, the object-matter has no real dis- tinction from the subject-matter, it is said to be unreal. (4) Object- matters may be concrete or abstract, singular or general (p. 38), but ' the only object-matters of the known {world which are truly objects or con- crete entities are material bodies or parts or systems' (p. 71). All else, e.g. consciousness, is merely an attribute or relation of material bodies. (5) If we inquire how we are to find out whether or no a given subject- matter corresponds to a real object-matter, we are told that ' there is no faw of thought, as such, by which the correspondence of subject-matter to object-matter can be established. . . It is therefore in the relatioln of thought to the not purely intellectual elements of experience, and to the objective world inferred from-those elements, that we must look for 28</page><page sequence="4">422 NEW BOOKS. a primary confirmation of the hypothesis that anything is real. Apart from logical reference to experience which is not purely intellectual, the assertion of existence, or reality, is sheer dogma devoid of any possible verification' (p. 82). Further 'marks' of reality are singularity a,nd con- creteness (ibid.). The obvious criticism on all this is, that it is the mere statement of the problem, not, as the author seems to think, its solution. Thus, to ta,ke merely the loctrine of the 'correspondence' or ' symbolic reference' of thought to the object, how can we ever know when this reference is 'true' or 'scientific'? In fact, the very distinction between thought and object is, surely, itself an act of thought, and contains within itself the same d-ualism, capable of being drawn out by yet another act of re- flexion, and so on in infinitum. Nor does it help us to fall back on the 'non-intellectual' element in experience. Apparently the author means sense-experience, but as he hinself adopts the Lockian distinction between primary qualities which are ' objective' and secondary qualities which ' do not belong to objects, as stich' (p. 107), and a,dmits (p. 106) that our 'passing perceptions' symbolise objects no less than our 're- flective thoughts,' it is hard to see how we touch reality here. In fact, the argument appears to involve a circle. For we are said to 'infer' the objective world from our non-intellectual experience, and inference un- doubtedly involves thought. It appears then, that our sense-perception is symbolical of the objects which we infer from it, but in turn this inference, as involving thought, is itself symbolical of-what ? Incidentally the author deals with certain logical problems, but does not seem to be acquainted with the best modern thought on these sub- jects, unless he ignores such works as Mr. Bradley's and Prof. Bosanquet's purposely. IThe second half of the book, containing an elaborate attempt at a classification and systematisation of the sciences, is in some ways most interesting. It certainly is exhaustive-to such a degree, that the author has had to invent quite a number of new names for sciences demanded by his scheme, but not yet existing, at least as independent sciences. Thus we hear of Peri-biology; Peri-anthropology; Ego-an- thropology; Ethereology; Neo-history, etc. This whole attempt at classi- fication, though it leads to some interesting remarks and side-lights in detail, yet is, like the analogy between knowledge and an animal organism, much of the nature of a clever intellectual ' spielerei' without much theoretical value. This applies more particularly to the elaborate diagrams (concentric circles with numberless sectors) by means of which the author tries to ' symbolise' the relations of the sciences. The attempt to label and pigeon-hole the efforts of the intellect in the appre- hension of reality under its various aspects, must always be arbitrary and artificial, if only because it is bound to make the distinctions and boundary-lines far more definite than they really are. In conclusion, the author promises another work on the ' tissues' or 'uniting principles' of knowledge, for he claims to possess 'certain genuine clues for exploring the anatomy of knowledge in these, its final, aspects' (p. 226). His present work does not incline one to look forward with much hopeful expectation to the fulfilment of that promise. R. F. ALFRID HOERNLI,.</page><page sequence="5">NEW BOOKS. 423 Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology. Edited by JAMES MARK ,BALDWIN. VOl. iii., Bibliography of Philosophy, Psychology, and Cognate Subjects. Compiled by BENJAMIN RAND, Ph.D., Harvard University. Part I. Bibliographies, Dictionaries, etc.; History of Philosophy; Philosophers: their works, and works upon them- pp. xiv, 542. Part II. Systematic Philosophy; Logic; LEsthetics; Philosophy- of Religion; Ethics; Psychology-pp. vi, 543-1192. New York and London: Macmillan, 1905. This valuable dictionary is completed by the issue of the present volume which aims at furnishing, not an absolutely exhaustive, but a compre- hensive bibliography of philosophy under the rubrics noted above. The importance of such a work certainly justifies the great amount of time which Dr. Rand has devoted to it during the last decade; and he is to be congratulated on terminating, on the whole successfully, what must have been a very laborious task. This copious bibliography substantially increases the value of Dr. Baldwin's dictionary, and Dr. Rand may rest assured that his work will certainly, as he modestly hopes, further re- search. It has a long career of usefulness in front of it; but perhaps its greatest service will be to stimulate the production of complementary works traversing the same ground more minutely and surveying it more systematically. For, although it is probably inevitable, and even just as well, that there should be one such work arranged throughout, like the present, alphabetically, such an arrangernent has occasional serious dis- advantages. It must be admiitted that the research student requires more minute subdivision than the present work affords in some directions, while the exclusively alphabetical arrangement of the divisions given breaks up chronological order without furnishing him with any logical clues. Thus, suppose one desirous to work up the Philosophy of History turned to this volume: he would discover, probably to his surprise, that there is no section devoted to the subject, and we do not envy him the task- of collecting his authorities from alphabetical lists under the heads noted above. Even more surprising is the absence of a section on Sociology, and one might even have ex- pected another on Economics. The amount of material has, we are informed, been apportioned according to the relative importance of authors and subjects; but surely we are not to understand that the subjects just named are of no importance; or to infer from the pro- portion of pages that Psychology is twice as important as Ethics, three times as important as the Philosophy of Religion, or quite five times as important as Logic. No doubt the annual issues of the " Psychological Index" published by the Psychological Review-which since 1902, the date to which the lists given in this volume extend, has been and will continue towbe published as its supplement-explains why we have an exhaustive bibliography in one direction, but it does not excuse the absence of any in others. Perhaps all the information is contained somewhere, but you certainly have to hunt for it. Where, for example, does one find Simmel's Philosophie des Geldes, or discover what Durk- heim or Tarde may have to say on social questions? Then turning to authors: One could have wished that there had been a section " English philosophers: their works and works upon them ". As it is English thought is only treated separately under " History of Philosophy," where it is dismissed in four columns; and although individual writers are treated of under " Philosophers: their works, etc.," it is not easy to see what raises a writer to the dignity of a section of his own. Why is there not one on Bradley as well as on Sidgwick ? Why is there a lengthy</page><page sequence="6">424 NEW BOOKS. section on M. Fouillee while Ward only exists as disjecta membra ? A feature of the work is the reference to important critical reviews by specialists, and the reference to periodical articles. The numerous references to MIND are given in a way that may prove misleading. The first volume of the New Series is numbered xvii., as consecutive to the sixteen volumes of the Old Series, disregarding, in a way that has very little to recommend it, our own method of numbering our volumes. Thus Dr. Bosanquet's article " Hedonism among Idealists," N. S., xii., is given on page 899 as MIND, xxviii. A number of these references have been tested and found correct, but not all. Thus the late Prof. Ritchie's article, "The One and the Many," is given on page 629 as MIND, xxviii. This ought, of course, on the system adopted, to be xxiii., as Ritchie's article was published in 1898, Dr. Bosanquet's in 1903. In spite of such a slip, however, great care has evidently been taken during the enormous labour of compilation and verification. DAVID MORRISON. Development and Divine P ?rpose. By VERNON F. STORR. London: Methuen's, 1906. Pp. xi, 287. This book forms the first-fruits of the newly endowed lectureship in the philosophy of religion founded at Cambridge by Dr. Stanton, and those who observed the great promise of Mr. Storr's work as. a philosophy tutor at Oxford and regretted that reasons of health took him away all too soon, will be delighted to see that he has obtained so congenial an opportunity of expressing his ideas in the sister university. And Mr. Storr's book will be no disappointment. Although the lectures which compose it are intentionally popular in form, they contain a singularly lucid, candid, and in some respects very effective, discussion of a great question. This question, perhaps that of the greatest real importance in philosophy, is as to how far the progressive making of reality which we call ' Evolution' can be, or must be, iiterpreted theistically, as the con- tinuous " self-revelation of a Personal God and the gradual unfolding of the spiritual meaning of the universe " (p. 286). Mr. Storr does not venture to affirm that this can as yet be demonstrated, but his discussion of the relations of evolution, teleology and theology, evincing as it does a firm grasp both of the scientific and of the philosophic considerations which are germane to the problem, is thoroughly up-to-date and will be found helpful even by those who do not share his philosophic standpoint. That standpoint is apparently best described as being that of a ' personal id6alist' pure and simple, and rather disarms criticism by the modesty of its claims. For example Mr. Storr admits that the belief in teleology rests on a human attitude rather than on logical proof (p. 267), that the teleological argument cannot establish the existence of a Creator (p. 198), but produces only a general impression which constitutes "an almost irresistible appeal " to human intelligence (p. 128). On the other hand he is not beguiled into using bad arguments, a failing too common in apologetic literature, and he has perceived what Kant and his transcen- dentalist followers have curiously failed to see, viz., that there is no escape from a naturalistic interpretation of existence, if Hume's criticism of the volitional conception of Causation is allowed to stand unchallenged (pp. 271-274). If Mr. Storr will only give his belief in the validity of the conception of power the backing it needs from a voluntaristic meta- physic, if he will extend his explanation that ultimate convictions are attitudes rather than arguments also to those of his naturalistic op- ponents, if he will conceive the Divine purpose as not intrinsically</page><page sequence="7">NEW BOOKS. 425 inscrutable, but as capable of being gradually gathered from its empirical working out in history, he will find that he has no reason to be ashamed of his preference for the teleological reading of the hieroglyphs of the cosmic history, and that his method has at least this indefeasible advan- tage over any other that it alone renders the course of events fully con- formable with that of the human mind, and so alone renders the cosmic story truly intelligible. F. C. S. SCHILLER. Christianity and Sex Problems. By HUGH NORTHCOTE, M.A. Phil- adelphia: Davis Co. (London: Medical Supply Association), 1906. Pp. 257. Price 8s. The atithor is an Anglican clergyman who has spent many years in New Zealand. He writes throughout from the standpoint of a liberal and comprehensive Christianity, discussing in order all the sexual difficulties and problems which are most frequently encountered in life. While the author's position is thus frankly Christian he stands apart from those writers of popular manuals on these subjects who moralise and dogmatise on a very slender basis of knowledge. He is in touch with the most competent scientific authorities on sexual questions, and he always treats with due consideration the arguments that oppose the conclusions he himself accepts. These conclusions are not in every case the most usual or conventional conclusions, but they are generally well worked out and brought to the touchstone of experience, so that they deserve respect even when they cannot be accepted. The book will be chiefly valuable to clergymen and ministers, who are constantly called upon to give opinions and guidance on the matters here dealt with, but will also be found helpful and inistructive by many others. HAVELOCK ELLIS. The Meaning of Good: a Dialogue. By G. LOWES DICKINSON. Third edition. London: Brinsley, Johnson &amp; Ince, Limited. 1906. Pp. 224. Price 4s. 6d. Readers of MIND will welcome this third edition of a book with which most of them will be familiar, but which has lost nothing of its fresh- ness and suggestiveness since it was first reviewed in these pages (N. S., x., 413). Rather one may say that some of the characters in the book and their views have gained a fresh interest from their reappearance in a different setting in the author's latest book, A Mlodern Symposiu?m. L'a&amp;ttention. , Bibliotheque internat. de psych. exp6rimentale. By W. B. PILLSBURY. 1906. Paris: Doin. Pp. 305. It was a happy idea to devote a volume of this series to Attention. This is and will always remain one of the central facts and problemas of Psychology. Its treatment, however, has been often very diffuse and not always very explicit. Prof. Pillsbury has gathered the material together and gives a very clear and systematic account. After a review of the' psychical effects and the motor accompaniments of attention, its conditions are reduced to two classes-the objective, consistingf in the intensity, the extension and the duration of the stimulus; and the sub- jective conditions, namely, the idea present to the mind and the mental attitude at the moment, the education, the social milieu and the heredity of the individual. The conception of interest furnishes nothing new and the feeling of activity is itself a group of sensations. A detailed review</page><page sequence="8">426 NEW BOOKS. brings the conclusion that attention plays the same part in controlling processes of proximately cenitral origin as in controlling those of peripheral origin. The conditions of the formation of association and recall are, apart from the intensity and repeatedness of the sensa- -tions, practically identical with the subjective conditions of attention above mentioned. Two interesting chapters discuss the relation of attention to perception and memory. The treatment of the theories of apperception rests naturally on Leibnitz, Herbart, Wundt and Stout, and leads to the following conclusion: Every one admits that nothing beyond the limits of consciousness can serve as an explanation of the facts of consciousness, at least in psychology. But every one seems to feel also that the simplest explanation would be to assume that an external agent, called conation, apperception or will, determines mental states, rather than to imagine them determining themselves. This is evident from the constant fluctuation in the theories of the last three of the authors named. The only decision we can cling to has its funda- mont in the facts of consciousness themselves. All we can say is, that consciousness changes in certain ways and that the changes in the -present stand in definite relations to those of the past and to the primitive states of consciousness. Leaving aside completely all that is not psychology, we shall resolve the difficulty perhaps by saying " ap- perception is a term which expresses the fact that every event in con- sciousness differs in some degree from what it would have been had the preceding history of the individtual been different, all present circum- stances remaining identical. Apperception would then be merely a general term expressing the conditions of attention, the relation between the observed facts." The same broad conclusion results from a dis- cussion of the theories of attention, which are all found to be in- complete. " Attention is not one of these things, individually, it is all -of them taken together and more still. We cannot consider feeling or the sensation of the moment as an explanation of the process of attention, even in its simplest form. To understand it we must look back to the impressions received at more distant periods of our life and to the dispositions with which man is endowed at birth." Anatomical, physio- logical and pathological theories lead on to the chapter of general con- clusions which closes the volumie. Prof. Pillsbury has written a useful book. His conclusions, however, seem to me to be too broad to be useful, unless he is consistent and dismisses the problem as illusory. Attention can be influenced by past experience, heredity, the social milieu and the like, but it surely has as little itself to do with these things, as a theory of digestion as such requires a survey of all we have eaten and been. Unless the problem is illusory, there nust be facts which a clear eye for the phenomenology of consciousness will see and a functional basis for these, which psychology can discover. Entirely subordinate to this chief relation are any theories which spring from the hypothesis of evolution. H. J. WATT. Kant's ' Privatmeinungen '. fiber das Tenseits und die Kant-Ausgabe der KICniglich preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften.' Ein Protest von LUDWIG GOLDSCHMIDT. Gotha: E. F. Thienemaun. 1905. Pp. 104. Price 2s. 6d. This little book contains two essays which are essentially polemical in character, and will interest mainly those who have made a special study of Kant, and more particularly of the details of the text and the ques- tions 'of interpretation arising out of them.</page><page sequence="9">NEW BOOKS. 427 The author has made a name for himself in Germany by a number of books, pamlphlets, and articles in philosophical periodicals, in wbich he appears in the role (somewhat rare in the annals of Kant-criticism) of an 'orthodox' Kantian, ready to defenid the entire self-consistency of Kant's critical philosophy and to accept it as the final solution of philosophical problems. Hence he wages a vigorous and merciless war on the vagaries of current Kant-criticism, and attempts to show that the self-contra- dictions which successive generations of Kant-critics have professed to find in Kant's pages, as well as most of the textual alterations and emendations proposed by them, are mainly due to simple failure to under- stand Kant's meaning. It cannot be denied that in many instances Dr. Goldschmidt's attacks on the Kant-philologen seem well-deserved, and in any case, his whole-hearted defence of Kant is as refreshing as it is valuable. More especially he deserves the gratitucde of every Kant- student for his reprint of G. A. S. MHellin's Marginalien und Register zu K'ant's Kritik der Erkeamtni.srerm4igen, first published in 1794-5 and praised by Kant himself, and for a facsimile reproduction of the first edition of the Kritik der Reinen Vernurift, original copies of which are nowadays very hard to obtain. The first essay in the book under review deals with an apparently minute point of textual criticism, viz., whether Kant meant to write ' keine Privat-meinungen' or 'reine Privat-meiniungen ' in the last sentence but one of the paragraph on the I discipline of the pure reason in regard to hypotheses' (A. 781, B. 810). Mlost editors follow Hartenstein in adopting the latter reading, but Dr. Goldschmliidt by an elaborate dis- cussion of the Kantian distinction between knowledge and faith, scientific hypotheses and practical postulates, succeeds in showing that the reading ' k.eine ' is dem-landed bv the context. The second essay is a severe criticismn of sonlie of the textual emenda- tions and corrections adopted into the new edition of Kant's works by the Prussian Academv of Sciences. Dr. Goldschmidt seemns right, not only in showing that somue of the readings adopted miianifestly pervert the sense of Eant's argumiient, but also in his general criticism-l of the whole method of the 'critical apparatus' appended to the text of that edition, as serving merely to perpetuate the record of all the countless misinterpretations with which the path of Kant-criticism is strewn. If Dr. Goldschmlidt's censures are justified, as they seem to be, the Academy-edition will not have made good its claiim- to be authoritative and final. Whatever nlay be the merits of Dr. Goldschmlidt's criticism-l in each individual case, there can be no doubt that he is one of the most thorough, earnest and sympathetic of Kant-students, whose views for this very reason demand attention and respect. R. F. ALFRED HOERNLE'. Saggi sulla Teoria della Conoscenza. Saggio Secondo: Filosofia della Metafisica. Da CosMio GUASTELLA. Palermo, 1905. 2 vols. Pp. 762 + 1044. Eight years ago I gave an account in this Review (MIND, Vol. vii., N. S., p. 576) of Prof. Guastella's first essay on the theory of knowledge. The present work represents the sam-e point of view, but displays wider knowledge and still higher powers of philosophical reasoning. To be sincere, in mny opinion it places the author in the front rank not only of Italian but of European criticism as an expert in the history of philosophy.</page><page sequence="10">428 NEW BOOKS. Prof. Guiastella is a positivist of the positivists, one who pushes positivism to its furthest logical consequences. Not merely does he resolve our knowledge of causation into the recognition of invariable phenomenal successions, but he maintains that no other causes can be known, for the good reason that no other causes exist or can be con- ceived. But, granting so much, the question presents itself, how to account for the claim of metaphysics to go behind appearances and to present a satisfying explanation of the realities which are supposed to underlie them. According to our author the answer is to be found in a tendency which leads the human mind to interpret what is unfamiliar by the analogy of what is familiar, combined with the idea that familiarity is itself an explanation, that when one event has always succeeded another in our daily experience we accept this constancy as a sufficient reason for its occurrence. It is to this law of mind that the notion of efficient causation owes its origin. An efficient cause is a cause explain- ing its effect, a something from our knowledge of which the effect could be deduced a priori and independently of experience. Agnostics froma Locke to Spencer, while denying that we can have such knowledge still allow the actual or possible existence of agencies that would put us in possession of it were they within the range of our observation and reasoning. But the philosopher who has learned to interpret the notion of cause in terms of simple sequence ought to understand that behind sequences there is nothing the discovery of which would explain them. The supposed hidden causes, were they disclosed, would be merely so many additional facts of experience. The earliest and most familiar of all experiences is the power of voluntary motion; and for no other reason than its familiarity this power is accepted as self-evident. Thus for primitive man will becomes the type on which all explanations of unfamiliar happenings are modelled. Hence arise the various anthropomorphic theories of nature, from savage animism up to the most elaborate metaphysical theologies, and not theo- logies only but also the atheistic hylozoisms which, like Clifford's theory of mind-stuff, assume that the universe would be more intelligible if it consisted of nothing but conscious elements. Another experience, only less familiar than voluntary action, is that the bodies without us move under the stress of their mutual impacts and pressures; and that this should be so is also assumed as self-evident from its habitual occurrence. Accordingly all the thorough-going systems of materialism explain natural events as more or less complicated atomic shocks, without considering that for bodies to move each other after contact is in itself no more intelligible than that they should move one another at a distance. So strong indeed is the primary instinct of assimilation that it over- rides and reverses man's original animistic philosophy. The spirit or consciousness to whose initiative all motion was once ascribed is in course of time declared incapable of acting on matter at all, or of being acted on by it. Hence arise theories of automatism and parallelism which Prof. Guastella regards as based on a fundamental fallacy-the fallacy that an effect must be explicable by its cause. And he makes this same fallacy responsible for the various metaphysical systems in which nature is constructed a priori, or in which such a construction is set up as the suprerne ideal of knowledge. Of these the most typical instances are to be found in what he calls dialectic realism, a method to whose exposure his whole second volume is devoted. As is well known, Auguste Comte identifies metaphysics with the ex- planation of phenomena by realised abstractions; and he regards this method as a necessary stage in the evolution of thought. But this the</page><page sequence="11">NEW BOOKS. 429 author considers a mistake. The tendency to realise abstractions bv no means coincides with metaphysical philosophy as a whole; nor has positivism explained why this tendency should characterise the transition fromu theology to science. His owil attemiipt to account for it forms the most original and ingenious part of the presenlt work. As usual efficient causation supplies the ma,ster-key. Abstractions come to be mistaken for objective realities as a result of their being first confounded with working causes; and they are so confounded because the chains of demonstrative reasoning into which they enter are imiistaken for actual chains of ante- cedents and consequents. Plato, the founder of Realism, always presents his objectified Ideas as linked together by a dialectic method of pro- gressive differentiation and specification; and analogous systems of de- duction have been attempted by his modern successors, Spinoza, Hegel, and Taine. None of these thinkers ascribes to his realised abstractions an existence apart fromi the phenomena which they inform; but for all they constitute the driving mechanismll by which phenomena are produced and intelligibly connected. And it is just this conception of realised ideas as forming a living organic unity which distinguishes their phil- osophy from the Realism of the schoolmien whose ideas are, as the author happily puts it, mnere fossils, the relics of a inisminderstood Platonisimi. Hegel's system is very slightly treated in the sections on Dialectic Realism, and Taine's views on the subject, having never been systemati- cally developed, afford little scope for serious criticism. It is otherwise with Plato and Spinoza; and Prof. Guastella's interpretation of their idealism, whether quite successful or not, is certainly original, searching, and suggestive. It seems to mle that the latest developmiients of Platonislm are not here sufficiently taken into accouint, and that Plato's tendency myore and more to substitute the activity of concrete mi-ind for the dialectic linking together of Ideas as the lkey to physical phenomuena rather goes against the theory that he ever regarded the Ideas as efficient causes. It also seemyis arbitrary to dism-iss Plato's own destructive analysis of the One and the 'Many in the Parm)?enide.s as consciously artificial and sophistic because it stancls in the way of the new view. And Spinoza's declared nomilinalisml- opposes itself as a serious obstacle to the realistic interpretation of his philosophy. But these are questions for Platonic and Spinozistic experts, to whose attentionl the second vTolume of this Essay is earnestly recomimle-endcled. Prof. Guastella looks on the nlotion that there are efficient causes, in the sense of causes which explain their effects, as an illusion not peculiar to an early stage of mental e-olution, but as necessarily inherenlt in the mental mechanism at a11 timnes. I do not agree with him there. In mly opinion both what we call primitiv e m-len ancl civilised men who are not metaphysicians have no other iclea of causatioin than unconditional ante- cedence, experinmentally verified as such. Their interest does not lie in understanding how things are produced, but in producing themll, or in getting other people to produce themii. For this purpose it is v-itallv mill- portant to distinguish between unconcditional antecedenits and more or less accidental concomitants ; an-d so by the time that disiniterested speculation begins the necessities of practical life have alreacly miade people sufficiently familiar with the imlechanism of experimental elimina- tion. Wlhy is night not looked on as the cause of day ? Because to pro- duce artificial darkness, as by closing, up a cave, does not, after any interval of time, result in a blaze of light, whereas a judicious use of the fire-drill or of flint and steel does. Why is lightning not miiistaken for the cause of thunder ? Because the production- of light is not in practice followed by a crashing sound. The collision or the bursting of clouds suggests itself as an antecedent more in liarm-lony with commllon experience.</page><page sequence="12">430 NEW BOOKS. As to what the author calls dialectic realism, this evidently originates in the fascination exercised on philosophers by the marvels of mathe- matical demonstration. Plato desiderated a science which should do for all nature what arithmetic and geometry did for the empirical rules of mensuration, and which should explain the facts postulated by arithmetic and geometry themselves. Spinoza was evidently inspired by the same ideal; and Hegel more remotely influenced by it through their example. This, if you will, was an abuse of assimilation, but an abuse not necessarily accompanying its use, and at any rate remote enough from the idea of efficient causation, which, as I have said, is no other than unconditional antecedence rightly understood. What the French, who are very liable to it, call simplisme is the last infirmity of noble thinkers, and an infirmity- from which Prof. Guastella himself is not entirely free. A. W. BENN. Che Cos' e il Bello ? Schewba d'un Estetica Psicologica. Manfredi Porena.. Milano: Hoepli. Pp. xi, 483. This book contains much that is suggestive, even for those who cannot approve the attempt to construct a purely psychological AEsthetic. It falls into two main divisions; the general theory of the beautiful, and the- system of the arts. The theory of the beautiful is subdivided into sections dealing with "the beauty of sense," with " expression," and with " inward beauty," by which I understand the beauty of content as such. Within " the beauty of sense " or " accessible to sense " (il bello sensibile) there are recognised immediate beauty and the beauty of relation, this latter including typical and final beauty. Within expression fall ." expressive forms " and " ex- pressive actions "-a. distinctive correlative with that between immediate beauty a.nd beauty of relation. And the treatment of inward beauty is. divided in the same way into immediate inward beauty and the inward beauty of relation. The systein of the arts follows on the whole a type of classification familiar in recent continental asthetic-the main division being taken between the "ideomimetic," i.e. the imitative or representative arts, in- cluding painting, sculpture a.nd (dramatic) recitation; and on the other hand the " free " arts, architecture and music, the parallelism between which has dominated many asthetic systems. A general treatment of the literary process from the point of view of representative perfection concludes the substantive part of the work. An appendix deals polemic- ally with the theories of Benedetto Croce, with which the present writer is not acquainted. It will be seen that the author's theory of beauty breaks up into three, parts, each df which repeats within itself what is essentially the same distinction. It is with a certain intention, probably, that " expression '" comes between "sensible beauty" and "beauty of content," between which it is a natural link. But as expressiveness or utterance has no special significance for the writer's doctrine, no true unity results froma this collocation, and distinctions which might have stood for phases in a development appear to recur (as " beauty of relation " within " sensible beauty ") within every pha.se. However, to pursue this point would perhaps be " cadere nella rbetafisica," which is the author's final word of censure. The general definition of beauty is " that which pleases the mind or soul (anima)," and the point thus mlade in the distinction between the aesthetic and the non-aesthetic senses is interesting. The eye and ear, it is boldly maintained, feel in their proper activity no trace of localised pleasure,</page><page sequence="13">NEW BOOKS. 431 such as that which attends on taste or smell. "Their enjoyment is- physically unlocalisable; it is an enjoyment of the soul, a consent, an approbation accompanied by pleasure which the soul bestows on a quality of the object . . . a pleasure of the soul void of sensory tone ' like that which accompanies the approval of goodness or intelligence. Can this. sharp separation be maintained ? In treating of expression the author insists that the lower senses can give rise to beauty of expression though not to the true beauty of sense (the scent of new-mown grass has ex- pressive beauty, artificial perfumes have not beauty of sense ; "in the. former case the soul judgles, in the latter, the nose "). There is truth in this; but when the lower senses are admitted to conjoin these distinct aspects of sense a.nd soul, can the higher senses be restricted to one ? Is there not in the greed of colour or brightness the same sensiious. character which we know in the covetousness of the "lower" senses? The underlying question of principle is whether some deeper principle, than the de facto character of the different senses would not have to be produced, if we are to account for the line between the pleasant and the beautiful of sense. In the Beauty of Relation-which may be beauty of sense-there is always a. demand or expectation or reference, a " pretesa," according to which we judge the presentation. In applying this view to typical beauty the author makes an ingenious suggestion for solving Burke's difficulty-if the normal of the species is the beautiful, how can beauty- be novel or compatible with novelty ? The author replies that while the. abnormal is ugly, the common normal is only neutral and not beautiful. Beauty only appears in case of a coincidence with type which (the coincidence) is exceptional and not normal; the type here concerned being " a kind of ideal resultant in which the various components of the experience find their equilibrium; a form in which all the differences. of too much and too little are eliminatedc". It is not, therefore, the- common normal, or average. We should like to know more about this type, but there might be a danger cadere nella metafisica. The above is of course a gallant attempt to escape from the difficulty of accounting for beauty of relation on the basis of mere association., The author is. anxious to maintain the pure subjectivity of beauty, and seems ha.rdly to recognise that subjective genesis by association is compatible with any degree of objectivity of value, a.nd that the latter is what we wish -Esthetic to explain. The same reference to an exceptional case of a character commonplace in itself is employed to explain the beauty of- imitative art (only exceptionally skilled or difficult imitation has artistic value) and the " beauty of judgment " in the account of literary process. (the exceptionally true or profound judgment may be called beautiful); what we should call an inspired saying. The book is well written, a.nd full of acute remarks and apposite in- stances. But the writer's repugnance to an " objective beauty" (though he takes this merely to mean a beauty apart from perception) prevents him from unifying his views. B. BOSANQUET.
