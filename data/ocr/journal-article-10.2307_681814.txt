It seems unconnected to adaptive fitness. It is, however, constrained by evolved properties of the mind. Recurrent- not necessarily universal fea- tures of acquired culture can be explained by taking into account the early development and constraining power of intuitive ontology, a set of principled domain-specific inferential capacities. These allow us to predict recurrent trends in domains as diverse as folk-psychology, representations of natural kinds, the uses of literacy, the acquisition of scientific beliefs, and even the limiting-case of religious ontologies. In all these domains the notion of cultural transmission along domain- specific cognitive tracks governed by intuitive ontology is supported by independent psychological evidence and provides testable explanations for recurrent features in the anthropological record. [evolution, culture, cultural universals, cognitive development, evolutionary psychology] In some domains of culture, (1) people's representa- tions seem crucially dependent on what was acquired through social interaction, (2) the representations seem to differ among human groups, and (3) whether people adopt one variant rather than another does not seem to have much effect on adaptive fitness. All three features are typi- cal of the core subject matter of cultural anthropology: kin- ship systems, religious representations, or political organi- zation for instance. Because of these features, it seems clear to many anthropologists and to some evolutionary bi- ologists too that an evolutionary framework cannot have much to say about their core subjects. However, this may be unduly pessimistic. The building blocks of an evolutionary framework in the explanation of cultural representations are already in place. This requires that we bring relevant cognitive evidence to a description of cultural transmission. This is why I turn to conceptual development in the first years of life, a domain of investi- gation that is rarely considered in theories of cultural evo- lution. The main point here is to provide a cognitively plausible bridge between two series of facts. First, evolution resulted in the emergence of species-specific cognitive capacities that predispose organisms to particular kinds of conceptual representations (Tooby and Cosmides 1992). Second, cul- tures can be construed as the outcome of cognitive epidem- ics in which human minds are "infected" by cultural repre- sentations, through an aggregation of individual processes of acquisition and communication (Sperber 1985). What is required is a link between these two facts. Here I propose that intuitive ontology, a set of principled expectations and inferential dispositions concerning various aspects of ex- perience, provides such a link. Acquired Culture: Against the Pointed Collar Argument The domain of explanation here is "ideational" culture, that is, mentally represented concepts, beliefs, values, and so on, which must not be confused with actual behavior (Cronk 1995). To describe the vast domain envisaged here, let me use a roughshod yet handy distinction, originally proposed by Tooby and Cosmides (1992), between evoked and acquired culture. Evoked culture is a set of capacities present in the cognitive equipment of all members of the species that may or may not be triggered by external cir- cumstances. For instance, a disposition to use significantly different criteria for short-term and long-term sexual part- ners may be universal in human females, yet circumstances may or may not make these criteria accessible and relevant (Buss 1989). To take another example, Fiske (1992) shows that different modes of social relations ("communal shar- ing," "authority ranking," "equality matching," and"mar- ket pricing") are based on specific cognitive capacities. The capacities and their consequences are similar, but cues from the social environment determine which capacity is applied to what domain: kinship, political relations, rela- tionships with the gods, and so on (see an extensive illus- tration in Fiske 1991).

By contrast, do- mains of acquired culture require massive cultural input to develop and display significant differences among human groups. Religious representations, for instance, may in- clude assumptions about dead people's souls, immortal gods, local spirits, or all, none, or indeed any combination of these. Each is acquired in social interaction with people holding (roughly) similar concepts. Because of this re- quirement, and of massive inter-group variation, a "juke- box model" is clearly insufficient. The question, then, is the following: What (if any) is the relevance of human evolution to acquired culture? or, What (if any) added value do we get by describing ac- quired culture in an evolutionary framework? The consen- sus answer to these questions seems to be: Not much. A radical version of this position would hold that evolution only provides vague directions to cultural evolution, by providing people with general learning capacities that do not predispose humans toward particular types of repre- sentations (see, for instance, Lewontin et al. 1984). Here I take it as demonstrated that this position is untenable for two reasons: because human cultures display universal and recurrent features that belie this account (Brown 1991), and because the very notion of a general, unprejudiced learning capacity makes little cognitive and evolutionary sense (Mithen 1996; Tooby and Cosmides 1992). However, accepting that evolution did result in specific cognitive predispositions does not by itself tell us in what way evolution is relevant to acquired culture. Indeed, it may lead many people to think that evolution is certainly important and relevant, but only to a narrow class of cul- tural phenomena. In this view, evolution results in particu- lar cognitive dispositions with consequences in domains that are directly relevant to adaptive fitness. Most of ac- quired culture seems adaptively neutral. It is therefore not very surprising that evolutionary models cannot say much about its variety and recurrent features. This position is based on what could be called the Pointed Collar Argument, after Delius's remark that "pointed rather than round collar tips, two- rather than three-button jackets seem unlikely to make any difference to the survival and the reproduction of the wearer" (Delius 1991). The point extends beyond such trivia as pointed collars. Acquired culture includes indefinitely many repre- sentations for which the link with evolutionary pressure is just negligible. Religious representations are a prime example. It is quite difficult to find convincing links be- tween adaptive fitness and the variety of religious repre- sentations. A natural conclusion is that cultural evolution in these domains has a specific dynamic, unconnected to the evolu- tionary history of the species. This possibility is described in great detail, and defended on empirical grounds, in Dur- ham's "co-evolutionary" account of the connections or in- teractions between genetic and cultural inheritance sys- tems (Durham 1991:437ff.). Among five types of interac- tion, Durham describes a"neutral mode" in which cultural transmission and genetic inheritance run in parallel, neither of them having any significant influence on the other. This "neutral mode" would seem to apply to many domains of cultural representations. Most aspects of religious repre- sentations, for instance, seem to be transmitted in this "neutral mode." That is to say, cultural evolution for those domains is seen as neither oriented nor limited by genetic constraints. Ironically, the recent development and explanatory achievements of evolutionary psychology may have con- tributed to strengthen this position. The phenomena stud- ied by evolutionary psychologists generally belong to do- mains (sex, incest, exchange, coalitions, and hierarchy) of direct relevance to adaptive fitness (Buss 1989; Cosmides 1989; Daly and Wilson 1988; Thornhill 1991). Also, these phenomena generally belong to "evoked culture," where external circumstances selectively trigger a hypothesized set of evolved, ready-made behavioral routines. So, al- though evolutionary psychology assumes that evolution is relevant to all domains of culture, it seems so far to have little to say about acquired culture. The Pointed Collar Argument may seem compelling, but we should keep in mind the following points: (1) We often evaluate the possible relevance of human evolution by examining acquired culture as described in anthropological frameworks that were never designed to answer the question: Are any evolved capacities involved? Doing this, we assume that it is possible,first to describe cultural phenomena in some explanation-neutral language and then to consider whether evolution accounts for the patterns observed. This is rather unrealistic, in this as in any empincal science. To use an analogy, if you describe mountain ranges in a language (say, that of human geogra- phy) that does not mention their mass, position, and dy- namics, you will certainly find that modern physics has nothing at all to say about them. To see whether the evolu- tionary history of the species is relevant to acquired cul- ture, we must re-describe acquired culture in a way that makes the connections verifiable. (2) So far, neither cultural anthropology nor evolution- ary biology has attempted to provide us with a proximate explanation of the transmission of acquired culture (Barkow 1989:82). True, in some domains evolutionary psychology has set a good example by giving explanations that bring together an evolutionaxy account of the advan- tages of some dispositions and a proximate explanation for their cognitive underpinnings (see, e.g., Cosmides and Tooby 1992 on social exchange). But these domains all be- long to evoked culture. For a similar progress in domains of acquired culture, we need an account of the various mecharlisms involved in the selection of variants in cul- tural transmission.</page><page sequence="3">878 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST * VOL. 100, NO. 4 * DECEMBER 1998 In the rest of this paper I illustrate an approach to ac- quired culture that starts from these two points. I first de- scribe the set of ontological categories and inference mechanisms developed from early childhood as a result of cognitive evolution. Mithen (1996) makes a compelling case for the fact that such specialized capacities are the out- come of the evolutionary history of the species. I will show how this intuitive ontology constitutes a proximate expla- nation of recurrent trends in various domains of acquired culture. Intuitive Ontology Intuitive ontology is not just a catalogue of types of ob- jects in the world, but also a set of quasi-theoretical as- sumptions about their underlying properties and definite expectations about their observable features. Intuitive on- tology comprises "naive theories" of broad domains such as PERSON, ANIMAL, PLANT, or ARTIFACT. Clearly, categorical distinctions along ontological lines are present from infancy. The obvious distinction between con-specifics and other objects can, for instance, be ob- served in the use of particular cues for face-recognition (Morton and Johnson 1991) as well as many other forms of specific interaction (Meltzoff 1994). Less obvious distinc- tions are also present. Mandler and her colleagues have demonstrated the existence of a variety of ontological cate- gories such as plants and artifacts in 1 8-month-old children (Mandler and Bauer 1989; Mandler et al. 1991). At 18 months "children do not differentiate dogs from horses or rabbits in the same way that they differentiate dogs from sea or air animals" (Mandler et al. 1991:290). To turn to inferences from categorization, an important result of experimental studies of early conceptual develop- ment is the evidence for domsin-specific principles. Con- ceptual development in the first years seems to require a rich initial state of specific principles that (i) orient the child's attention to particular perceptual cues for each do- main, (ii) constrain the child's inferences derived from those cues, and (iii) develop in relatively autonomous de- velopmental trajectories (Gelman 1990:83). Identifying objects as belonging to such categories as PERSON, ANI- MAL, PLANT, or ARTIFACT triggers the activation of specific forms of inference which focus on particular as- pects of the objects considered and only handle informa- tion pertinent to that aspect. This is illustrated in such do- mains as the representation of number, the understanding of physical properties of solid objects, biological infer- ences, and the representation of mental states. In the domain of NUMBER, experimental studies have shown how an empiricist account of development fails to explain the child's mathematical competence. Simple ad- dition and subtraction skills in infants appear long before the child can pass standard "conservation" tests. Infants at- tend to the "numerosity" of stimuli as a distinct property. For instance, they dishabituate (i.e., attend to the stimulus display with renewed intensity) if an experimenter, after adding an object to another object behind a mask, removes the mask and reveals the unexpected situation of only one object (Wynn 1992; see also Antell and Keating 1983; Starkey et al. 1990). Such principles also constrain further acquisition, in particular the acquisition of labels for num- bers (Wynn 1992). "Intuitive physics" illustrates the early development of ontological principles. People's "naive" expectations about statics and dynamics of solid objects do not usually con- verge with those of scientific physics (diSessa 1988; Kai- ser et al. 1986; McCloskey 1983). Many pnnciples under- lying adult intuitive expectations appear early in infancy, for example, "continuity" (objects move in continuous paths), "solidity" (objects do not coincide in space) and "support" (unsupported objects fall downwards) (Baillar- geon 1987; Baillargeon and Hanko-Summers 1990; Spelke 1990). Also, the Piagetian principle of "no action at a dis- tance" and the connected distinction between causal and non-causal relations between movements seem to develop in infants long before there is any sensorimotor experience to support it (Leslie 1979; Leslie and Keeble 1987). Another important domain of specific development is the difference between LIVING THINGS and other types of objects, ARTIFACTS in particular. From an early age, identification of artifacts and of living things makes use of specific perceptual cues (Gelman et al. 1995; Premack 1990). Specific inferences are triggered by those cues. A categorical distinction between animates and inanimates is enriched with a variety of specific principles concerning biological aspects of live beings. Identifying something as a member of such categories as animal or plant triggers particular aspect-specific inferential principles, in particu- lar the following: (1) All living things are grouped in terms of mutually exclusive, jointly exhaustive taxonomic categories (Atran 1990). (2) Taxonomic proximity is tacitly assumed to correlate with similarity, either observable or non-obvious, a finding that is stable in children's intuitions about putative proper- ties of unknown living kinds.l (3) Possession of an underlying specific essence is con- strued as the cause of outward appearance or behavioral regularities. (4) Structure is abductively explained in the context of function, so that real animals, for instance, have legs "so they can walk," while this inference does not extend to toy animals. This kind-essentialism underpins children's intuitive denial of the possibility of kind-transformation (Keil 1986), as well as their construal of the mechanisms whereby kind- essence causes external features (Rosengren et al. 1991; Springer and Keil 1989, 1991). Essentialism supports the intuition that kind-membership overrides perceptual</page><page sequence="4">BOYER / CULTURAL INHERITANCE 879 resemblance as a predictor for non-obvious properties, es- pecially "inherent" properties of the exemplars, for exam- ple, ways of breathing and feeding, rather than weight or speed (Gelman 1988; Gelman and Markman 1987). Chil- dren from the age of three also assume that the changes caused by growth go beyond the perceptual features (Rosengren et al. 1991). Changes in living things are as- sumed to be lawful, not random, and specific to the onto- logical domain of living things. Another set of specific principles underpin "intuitive psychology" or "theory of mind," that is, the intentional explanation of behavior. Intuitive principles specify a range of mental entities and their causal connections with observable action (see, for instance, Gopnik 1993; Gopnik and Meltzoff 1997; Perner et al.1987; Wellmann and Estes 1986; Whiten 1991). Preschoolers assume that causal links connect actual situations to perceptions, perceptions to be- liefs, and beliefs to intentions, while causal links in the other direction are nonstandard (Wellmann 1990). A cru- cial feature of this domain is that intentional accounts of behavior require the construction of meta-representations, for example, representations of representations of states of affairs (Leslie 1994). Dedicated structures allow the infant to detect gaze-direction and attentional focus in others as a prelude to understanding the causal structure of their men- tal states (Baron-Cohen 1991; Baron-Cohen and Cross 1992). Meta-representation of such states allows explana- tion and prediction of behavior (e.g., I know that Sally thinks that "x"), and there is strong evidence for meta-rep- resentational capacity in the two-year-old's pretense play (Leslie 1987). Changes in the handling of meta-repre- sentations allow the child gradually to build more complex intentional accounts of their own and others' behavior, in- cluding behavior based on erroneous belief (Wimmer and Perner 1983). This quasi-theoretical understanding of oth- ers results in a more refined understanding of the child's own mental states (Gopnik 1993). In summary, intuitive ontology comprises (1) a set of broad perceptually grounded categories and (2) a set of as- pect-specific inferential principles activated by these cate- gories. They constrain the range of inferences to be derived from available information, by triggering a set of definite intuitive expectations about the observable features and likely underlying properties of different types of objects, beyond objects actually experienced.2 These structures are part of the evolved cognitive equipment typical of the spe- cies. This does not entail that they are necessarily "innate" or modular in terms of neural architecture. All that is nec- essaw for the present argument is that intuitive ontologies are the normal outcome of early cognitive development. Evolved ontology, it should be stressed, is neither opti- mal nor necessarily true. It is certainly not exhaus- tive there are domains of experience for which it does not deliver any stable intuitions. Also, intuitive ontology may well be metaphysically unsound, postulating such things as "essences" in living things or "beliefs" in intentional agents without much evidence. Such flaws can only be ex- pected in an ontology that was built by natural selection rather than by trained philosophers. However, it is the ef- fects of intuitive ontology that concern us here, in particu- lar its effects on how people draw inferences and build conceptual structures on the basis of cultural input. Cultural Enrichment of Intuitive Principles In some domains, cultural input seems to provide infor- mation that enriches the skeletal categories and inferential principles of intuitive ontology. This may take different forms, as we will see, but the common point is that cultur- ally provided information is attended to because prior prin- ciples specify that a domain exist as well as constrain the type of information that will feed the developing domain. Consider, for instance, the domain of NUMBER. Obvi- ously, labels for numbers are different among languages. Also, different human groups have structurally different counting systems. Children have no difficulty acquiring these labels. According to Gallistel and Gelman (1992), easy acquisition requires that children assume a set of prior principles, namely (1) one to one correspondence (between objects enumerated and names for numbers), (2) stable or- dering of labels, (3) item indifference, (4) order indiffer- ence for the items counted, and (5) cardinality: only the last name counts as the cardinal value of the whole set. In other words, children have prior numerosity principles that spec- iify a number of conceptual slots for number-names, and these names are provided by cultural input, perhaps the simplest example of the direct word-to-concept mappings that allow for lexical acquisition in general (Clark 1993). The extension of the list and the combinatorial principles can vary from one place to another, but they are always consistent with these prior principles (Crump 1990). In other domains the computational process of enrich- ment is more complex but equally important to the selec- tion of cultural representations. Early distinctions between animates and inanimates support the development of prin- ciples applied to living things, in particular the "essential- ist" principles described above. Naturally, these principles are not the end point of the development of biological no- tions. In most cultural environments, one finds a wealth of detailed representations of natural kinds, of their relations, their behavior, structural aspects, and so on. I refer here to representations of biology that are not acquired in the con- text of institutional schooling, but as part and parcel of eve- ryday cultural skills and notions, at the exclusion of scien- tific biology. A striking feature is that most of this knowledge is continuous with the early-developed princi- ples listed above (Atran and Medin 1998). Cultural input widens the scope of early biological understandings (it is not obvious for a three-year-old that plants are alive and share common biological principles with animals). Also, it</page><page sequence="5">880 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST * VOL. 100, NO. 4 * DECEMBER 1998 specifies causal processes that were postulated but not specified by intuitive principles. Children, for instance, ac- quire notions about the growth of living things that require prior principles about law-like, internally generated changes (Rosengren et al. 1991). Also, essentialist princi- ples postulate that there are differences among essential in- heritance, contagion, and externally induced similarities. These processes apply to different features of living things (Springer and Keil 1989).3 Although folk-theories in this domain vary, they are congruent with these principles, for instance in the connections they describe between food-in- take and growth or contact with particular substances and the occurrence of disease (Springer and Keil 1991). Cul- tural representations also extend to theoretical construc- tions about what makes living things live. Consider, for in- stance, speculative notions about"life," "vitality," "elan vital," and other such culturally specific concepts (see, for instance, Karim 1981). These are all enrichments of the in- tuitive understanding that all members of living species share an inner causal essence, an understanding that does not specify what that essence is or how it causes its effects. To sum up, this is a case in which cultural input triggers representations that dovetail with prior intuitive principles. The same could be said of cultural representations de- veloped in the understanding of mental states and their be- havioral consequences. These comprise a range of cultural notions about the "self," about the link between conscious- ness and various organs or bodily properties, about person- ality and dispositions, and so on. Such speculations can take very different forms in different social groups (Heelas and Lock 1981). In some Western locations, for instance, most people describe and explain people's behavior in terms of stable individual dispositions. In most other cul- tural environments, by contrast, explanation of behavior tends to focus on features such as social position or interac- tion. Hsu's famous studies of Chinese perceptions of the self are a salient example (Hsu 1981), and the point, in fact, may apply much more generally to nonindustrial environ- ments (Shweder 1982: 113ff.). Such differences do not nec- essarily stem from globally different "world-views." As Morris and Peng (1994) have shown, Chinese and Ameri- can subjects tend to perceive social interaction but not physical motion in different ways. Intuitive psychology as- sumes that beliefs affect intentions, but under-specifies the mechanisms generating intentions in the first place. These can be specified by culturally diverse personality-based or circumstance-based explanations. Many other domains are shaped by enrichment, al- though not all are equally well understood. Consider, for instance, the acquisition of kinship categories. Psychologi- cal studies have often used kinship categories as unprob- lematic examples of "collections." However, the infer- ences activated by the term family are very different from the usual implications of collection-inclusion (Markman 1973). Hirschfeld used this and other evidence to show that the child's ontology includes some nontrivial expectations about human co-resident collections ("families") as dis- tinct from other kinds of categories. In particular, an intui- tive understanding of kinship-groups makes co-residency one of their typical criteria. By contrast, most other catego- ries are constructed by abstracting from contiguity rela- tions or the scripts that associate objects. Moreover, the child's intuitive expectations about some aspects of kin- ship categories can be inferred from patterns of error in children's usage, or rather from the errors children do not make: for instance about generation and gender (Hirsch- feld 1989). In other words, an intuitive understanding of co-resident groups (which may, of course, be inaccurate given the local kinship system) is required to acquire local kinship categories and distinctions. A different variety of enrichment occurs when intuitive expectations in one domain contribute to the recurrence of representations in another one. Social categories, for in- stance, are often represented on the basis of principles di- rectly transferred from intuitive biological understandings. Membership of certain social categories is understood as the effect of a group-specific, generally non-obvious causal essence (Boyer 1990; Rothbart and Taylor 1992). Shamans or diviners, for instance, are often represented in this way. For other concepts like PRIEST in Christian churches, there is an ''official,'' non-essentialist understanding of the category; even in such cases, people seem spontaneously to activate the assumption that people who hold such of- fices probably share some undefined underlying essence (Boyer 1994). In many cases, racial categories also seem to be based on essentialistic assumptions. Their reference is not biologically fixed and their extension depends on ex- ternal historical variables. Even for young children, racial categories are not just the labels for salient perceptual dif- ferences among people. For instance, young children make the assumption that some non-obvious underlying features are involved before they acquire perceptual stereotypes for each group, not as a result of such acquisition (Hirschfeld 1988, 1993). For Hirschfeld (1996), these essentialistic as- sumptions are not "transferred" from the domain of biol- ogy; they are the outcome of a more diffuse form of causal essentialism. "Enrichment," then, refers to a variety of computational processes. Exposure to the cultural input may result in pa- rameter setting, filling-in of indeterminate place-holders, creation of finer-grained conceptual distinctions, or the creation of an abductive context for intuitive expectations. In the domains described above, intuitive expectations and their principles put a strong selective constraint on cultural representations. All else being equal, one should predict that input that does not result in representations enriching these principles will be either distorted or ignored. On the contrary, information that either is expected because of in- tuitive principles or enriches skeletal principles should en- joy a selective advantage in cultural transmission.</page><page sequence="6">BOYER / CULTURAL INHERITANCE 881 Counter Intuitive Representations Let me now turn to a different situation, one in which cultural input triggers representations that seem to violate intuitive expectations. The clearest illustration is religious representations, in which the violation of intuitive expecta- tions is both salient and widespread. Here I will focus on cultural assumptions about the existence and particular causal powers of a range of supernatural entities and agen- cies (see Boyer 1994 for a more detailed account). In most cultural environments, religious concepts seem to violate expectations described above as central to intuitive ontol- ogy. Mountains, for instance, may be described as living beings, trees as having thoughts and memories, statues as intentional actors, and so on. The most widespread form of religious ontology postulates the existence of agencies (spirits, gods, ancestors) whose physical properties are counter-intuitive. They are invisible or immaterial, they can move instantaneously, and in some cases they can be at different locations at the same time. The problem, then, is to understand how these assumptions are in effect com- bined with intuitive expectations. The first step in a causal account of such representations is to accept that they really are counter-intuitive in the lim- ited sense described here, that is, relative to intuitive onto- logical expectations. Whether some phenomenon is counter-intuitive or not in this specific sense does not de- pend on people's explicit, culturally transmitted theories about such things as "nature" or "reality" (if they hold any such explicit conceptions). This is because intuitive ontol- ogy delivers expectations, not theoretical justifications for their existence. By the same token, one should not confuse what is, from a cognitive viewpoint, intuitively counter-in- tuitive, with what is perceived as unfamiliar.4 Finally, one should not confuse the counter-intuitive and the unreal. People may be convinced of the actuality of some counter- intuitive phenomenon; this does not make it less counter- intuitive in the precise sense used here. This point is par- ticularly important; that religious assumptions are counter-intuitive and construed as actually true is probably what makes them of particular interest. Counter-intuitive elements, however, are only part of the representations activated. Religious concepts also acti- vate a number of additional background assumptions that are not counter-intuitive and in fact are directly provided by intuitive ontological expectations. Take, for instance, anthropomorphic spirits and gods. These are explicitly construed as counter-intuitive; their physical properties in particular mark them off from other, non-counter-intuitive agents. At the same time, these assumptions are clearly in- sufficient as a starting point for inferences about spirits. The information available to people consists, for instance, of narratives and demonstrations of the spirits' powers. Now these would be incomprehensible unless one as- sumed that the agencies described are intentional agents. In order to understand or explain or predict the spirits' behav- ior, then, people use the complex set of inferential psycho- logical principles called "intuitive psychology" or "theory of mind" (Boyer 1996). Barrett and Keil (1996) have shown that this is the case when people recall simple narra- tives in which superhuman agents are involved. Indeed, people use their intuitive "theory of mind" even when the agent, as in the case of the Christian God, is explicitly de- scribed as having nonstandard, extraordinary cognitive ca- pacities. In such situations, subjects use intuitive assump- tions that directly contradict the overt, socially acquired representation of gods. The same goes for those cases in which a counter-intuitive assumption is produced by trans- ferring expectations from one ontological category to an- other, for instance, by postulating that an artifact has bio- logical properties (a statue that breathes and bleeds, for example). Counter-intuitive assumptions are combined with the intuitive expectations that normally characterize the source domain: expectations about the nature and order of biological processes in this case (Boyer 1996). Religious concepts, then, combine two types of assump- tions. Counter-intuitive assumptions are a straightforward consequence of cultural input; a background of non- counter-intuitive assumptions is produced by default acti- vation of relevant intuitive principles that are not explicitly violated. These combined features, I would claim, explain the cultural success of such representations in many differ- ent cultural environments. Religious representations would probably not be acquired at all if their counter-intuitive as- pects did not make them sufficiently salient or "attention- grabbing." They would probably not be acquired and stored if their intuitive part did not give them sufficient in- ferential potential. Intuitive ontology results in specific expectations that apply to a limited number of broad ontological categories, so that the number of assumptions that directly violate them should also be limited. This may explain why there is only a limited range of recurrent religious ontological as- sumptions. This results in a very limited "catalogue" of possible religious assumptions. Despite their apparent di- versity, religious ontologies are in fact based on a small set of combinations of categories (PERSON, ANIMAL, AR- TIFACT, NATURAL OBJECT, and PLANT) and infer- ential principles (to do with intentional states, biological processes, and physical reality) (Boyer 1994). This pro- duces such recurrent combinations as PERSON with counter-intuitive physical properties (e.g., spirits, etc.), PERSON with counter-intuitive biological properties (e.g., immortal, or with particular reproduction, etc.), PERSON with counter-intuitive psychological properties (e.g., zom- bies or possessed people), ANIMAL with counter-intuitive biological properties (e.g., metamorphosed into other ani- mals), and ARTIFACT with intentional properties (e.g., thinking statues). Barrett's experimental studies on trans- mission of artificial quasi-religious concepts support the</page><page sequence="7">882 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST * VOL. 100, NO. 4 * DECEMBER 1998 hypothesis that concepts of this type are better recalled and transmitted than either standard representations or simply unfamiliar notions (BarreK 1996). This seems to confirm the prediction that, all else being equal, representations that combine counter-intuitive principles and intuitive back- ground in the way described here are more likely than oth- ers to be acquired, stored, and transmitted. Religion is a cognitively salient and socially crucial domain where such representations are found, but it is not the only one. Car- toons (with the counter-intuitive physics of their charac- ters), urban legends, and many rumors, magical supersti- tions, and folk-tales also include such concepts. Non-Intuitive Representations and External Support In the domains described so far, cultural representations are constrained by intuitive ontology both in their recurrent features and in the limits imposed on their variability. In other domains, acquired culture seems to replace intuitive expectations with fundamentally different representations. This is the case in scientific theories. Scientific concepts are often at odds with intuitive ontology. The ontology of scientific physics is not that of intuitive physical expecta- tions. In the biological domain, the essentialism that under- pins most intuitive biological notions is not really compat- ible with either evolutionary theory or molecular genetics (Atran 1990). More dramatically, it has been argued that our everyday intuitive belief-desire psychology may be misguided in both its ontology and its causal assumptions (Churchland 1981; Stich 1983). However, science is not the only domain where intuitive expectations are seem- ingly replaced with alternative conceptual structures. For instance, this replacement is in fact the goal of most ab- stract theorizing in philosophy as well as in explicit con- ceptions of "nature" and the cosmos, in ethical reflection, in explicit comparisons of possible political orders, and in scholarly theology. All these conceptual domains existed long before the emergence of scientific investigation. The cultural domains in question seem to free acquired culture from the constraints of intuitive expectations. In- deed, it would not be possible to predict the recurrent fea- tures of such domains, or their stability over time, on the basis of mere ennchment or violation of intuitive ontology. However, conceptual constraints from intuitive ontology are present here, too, and they may explain why such cul- tural domains (i) invariably use external material repre- sentations of concepts, (ii) generally appear in literate groups, and (iii) very often require long and sustained training. I propose that these characteristics point to a cen- tral feature of such "non-intuitive" cultural representations. They do not replace or displace intuitive expectations, but provide support for their meta-representation. To see this, we must first consider the function of mate- rial tokens in cultural transmission. These objects may be religious instruments or icons, tools, drawings, modified natural objects, written texts, and so on. Some of those to- kens are not even artifacts; a salient segment of the natural environment can play a similar function. Anthropological and archaeological theories often assume that material to- kens "embody" or "contain" cultural representations. This is why they are commonly called cultural "icons" or "sym- bols." Now this may be based on a confusion between (i) the representations reliably triggered by a particular mate- rial token in the minds of people who have particular repre- sentations to start with and (ii) the features of material to- kens that trigger such effects. That a statue has eight arms is a feature of a material object. That this evokes a particu- lar goddess is a mental event reliably caused by displays of this statue in people who have particular representations to begin with. The arms themselves "contain" no repre- sentations whatsoever,5 and whatever information they carry (in the information-theoretic sense) depends on the causal properties of the mind that perceives them. What makes these tokens of special interest for cultural acquisition is not that they "contain" representations but that they trigger meta-representations. This is the case, for instance, in visual representations. Speculation about the "meaning" and function of cave art has often obscured the simple point that these artifacts evidence particular repre- sentational abilities, whatever the purposes of their creators and the activities associated with them (Mithen 1990). These objects inevitably trigger meta-representations, that is, representations of the representations of the objects de- picted. Otherwise they would be treated as continuous with the surrounding visual display: if they were identified at all they would be treated as the objects they depict. Exposure to these types of material objects triggers in the mind af- fected not representations of the world but, rather, repre- sentations of these representations. This applies in particular to a case for which the confu- sion is especially widespread, that of socially transmitted written texts. The temptation here is to consider the stable element in written texts as a stability of represented "con- tent." But the alleged "content" is in actual fact a reliable effect only against a particular representational back- ground in the mind of the reader. The notion that texts con- tain frozen thoughts, as it were, is related to the idea that writing systems can encode mental representations. In- deed, there is a long history of people trying to find in old or exotic societies writing systems that would directly en- code facts or "ideas" as well as a history of misguided peo- ple trying to devise such systems. It is now well-estab- lished that there are no such systems. All writing systems of even minimal expressive power and complexity repre- sent speech as such, not the meanings expressed by sen- tences nor the facts described (Coe 1992; DeFrancis 1989). "Pictographic" repertoires, which do not directly represent speech, achieve a certain inferential stability only by being embedded in ritual structures that provide memorized,</page><page sequence="8">BOYER / CULTURAL INHERITANCE 883 constrained interpretations for the signs used (Severi 1987, 1993). If wnting can only represent speech, then what is triggered by reading is not just a representation of some state of affairs but a representation of some speaker' s utter- ances about a state of affairs. So this is a domain in which meta-representational abilities are necessaxy. That "non-intuitive" cultural concepts are meta-repre- sentations would be consistent with the fact that they seem to develop with the generalization of external repre- sentations and literacy, as many authors have pointed out (Donald 1991, 1993; Lloyd 1991). However, the fact that they are meta-representational also indicates that they do not replace intuitive expectations. In other words, there are no cultures where the physics of solid objects or the prop- erties of live beings or the causes of intentional action are fundamentally different from evolved ontology, inasmuch as intuitions are concerned. Two facts support this hypothesis. First, the acquisition of "non-intuitive" cultural concepts always requires sus- tained training over extensive periods, often in dedicated institutions with formal learning strategies. Second, a rich literature documents the persistence of intuitive expecta- tions even in subjects trained in the "non-intuitive" alterna- tive. Physical expectations about ballistics, for instance, are not really congruent with Newtonian mechanics (Caramazzaetal. 1981;CookeandBredin 1994;Kaiseret al. 1986; McCloskey 1983). Intuitive understandings can also distort our evaluation of probability. An intuitive pref- erence for frequency interpretations of probability makes evaluating the probability of a single event a particularly difficult task (Gigerenzer 1991; Gigerenzer and Hoffrage 1995) and may explain why even statistical "experts" can fail to apply Bayesian theorems to their appreciation of in- itial probabilities for events (Tversky and Kahnemann 1982; also see a discussion in Gigerenzer and Murray 1987:163-167). In the same way, students trained in logic still tend to give "wrong" (but intuitively salient) answers to simple tests and show robust biases in their evaluation of the confirmation of hypotheses (Wason 1983; Wason and Johnson-Laird 1972). In summary, acquired culture can add to intuitions some explicit comments on different (or better) concepts and offer explicit "non-intuitive" alterna- tives, not change or replace the intuitions themselves.6 "Memes" Replicated or Inferences Triggered? A central point of models of cultural transmission (of the precise, explanatory sort) is that cultural evolution is de- scribed in terms of selective retention of variants in a popu- lation of cultural "memes" (Boyd and Richerson 1985; Dawkins 1976; Durham 1991; Lumsden and Wilson 1981). Cultural representations are described as going down an "inheritance track," some properties of which are comparable to genetic inheritance, although it has its own dynamic (Durham 1991). The evidence considered here would require that we complete and modify this general . . . plcture ln two lmportant respects, in that (1) transmission does not consist in "replication" and (2) inheritance tracks may have very different properties from one conceptual domain to another. In selectionist models of cultural transmission, "memes" are construed as abstract realities that replicate by passing from one mind to another. Also, these models suggest that the external manifestations of cultural representations (ut- terances, gestures, etc.) and those representations them- selves are similar. For instance, Lumsden and Wilson write that "culturgens act via relational networks in long-term memory, and in many instances can be identified with them" (1981:27, emphasis added). Boyd and Richerson too assume that "culture is acquired by directly copying the phenotype" (1985:8). Even Dawkins, who is not really committed to a "replication" model of acquired culture, states that copying is the fundamental operation involved in transmission: "the phenotypic effects of a meme [ . . . ] may be perceived by the sense organs of other individuals, and they may so imprint themselves on the brains of the re- ceiving individuals that a copy (not necessarily exact) of the original meme is graven in the receiving brain" (Dawkins 1982:109). However, the evidence considered above shows that mental representations are never "downloaded" from one mind to another. Rather, they are built on the basis of cul- tural input by inferential processes (Sperber 1991; Tomasello at al. 1993). It follows that what matters in ex- plaining transmission is not so much the properties of me- mes as the properties of memes in interaction with the properties of inferential processes activated about them. In particular, meme- and gene-inheritance are really diametri- cal in that for genes, successful mutations are the exception and replication the rule; in the meme-domain on the other hand, mutation is constant and rough replication a salient phenomenon that requires special explanation (Sperber 1996). Because of these inferential processes, cultural cues by themselves are not, on the whole, a good predictor of recur- rent features of cultural representations. What you need to explain people's representations at time t + n is not just a description of the cultural input at time t, but also of the in- ferential processes that were in place before people were exposed to that cultural input. This is the case, for example, in folk biology. Some information about living beings is certainly transmitted explicitly, but as I said above this is informed by prior "essentalistic" principles that do not re- quire cultural transmission because they are spontaneously applied to living things. The same conclusion applies to va- rieties of folk psychology. They provide cultural informa- tion that fills in empty placeholders in a "theory of mind" that develops in much the same way all over the world. The tacit principles of "theory of mind" do not require cultural transmission; on the contrary, their spontaneous activation</page><page sequence="9">884 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST * VOL. 100, NO. 4 * DECEMBER 1998 allows transmission of additional information about minds and behavior. This is the case even in domains where it would seem that only cultural input matters, like religious representations. Here, too, cultural input triggers the grad- ual construction of cultural concepts only if prior principles of intuitive ontology are activated. In all these domains, then, properties of acquired culture are under-determined by cultural input. It follows that the recurrence of certain representations within a group and their relative stability over time do not require that all the relevant conceptual information be transmitted. Members of a social group build roughly simi- lar understandings of such domains as kinship relations, in- terpretation of people's behavior, religious agencies, moral imperatives, or political structure on the basis of fragmen- tary cues. This is why cultural anthropologists generally state that cultural representations are transmitted "implic- itly," which is descriptively (and vaguely) true but clearly insufficient as an explanation (Bloch 1985). The repre- sentations are in fact similar because, all else being equal, people's spontaneous inferences from similar cues are likely to be similar since they activate identical intuitive expectations. The notion of "memes," then, may be misleading if it re- fers both to mental representations and to the input that triggers their construction. More importantly, the notion of replication certainly is one idealization too many for mod- els of cultural transmission. The consideration of actual acquisition processes leads to the replacement of a straight- forward replication model with a contagion or epidemio- logical model (Sperber 1985). Here the relevant unit of de- scription is the occurrence of mental representations, construed as material events in particular minds. The re- currence of those events is the explanandum of theories of cultural evolution. General Capacity vs. Content Specifelc Inheritance Tracks Accepting that external cues provided by cultural input under-determines cultural concepts is not sufficient. We must also explain what constrains the inferences triggered by those external cues, in such a way that concepts enter- tained by members of generation n + I are roughly similar to those of generation n. In early "co-evolution" theories, tools imported from population genetics were used to model domain-general, quantitative aspects of transmis- sion. For instance, a behavior usually associated with high- status individuals may be transmitted more readily than others even if the connection between status and behavior is accidental (Boyd and Richerson 1985; Lumsden and Wilson 1981). More generally, many aspects of transmis- sion can be modelled in this way. The present account may provide us with a more detailed description of constraints of transmission, over and above these quantitative aspects. This leads to the conclusion that there probably is no single dynamic of cultural transmission, but rather a set of paral- lel "inheritance tracks" for cultural representations, each of which has its own specific dynamics. This stands in contrast to accounts of inferential trans- mission that emphasize a single "capacity for culture." For instance, Tomasello et al. (1993) have argued that a par- ticular form of acquisition, "cultural learning," accounts for diverse features of cultural evolution. They demon- strate that tool-making requires sophisticated perspective- taking capacities that are beyond the abilities demonstrated in apes. "Cultural learning" is special in that it relies on the "theory of mind" principles described above. In most do- mains of acquired culture it is simply not possible for de- veloping subjects to consider cues provided by cultural e- lders and to produce relevant inferences about them without representing those elders' communicative inten- tions, a point that is supported by the developmental evi- dence summarized above. However, this evidence would also suggest that perspec- tive-taking is not sufficient. It works to produce a relevant description of other people's representations only inas- much as an intuitive ontology selects a relevant description of these representations. Meta-representational capacities are themselves dependent upon other inferential capacities. To take a few examples: acquiring a counting system on the basis of cultural cues certainly requires that we repre- sent other people's thoughts about numbers, but we cannot do that unless we activate an independent capacity for in- ferences about numerosity. Acquiring a folk biology on the basis of people's utterances about plants and animals re- quires that we represent these people's thoughts about liv- ing things, but we cannot represent those thoughts unless we also activate intuitive tacit biological principles. Ac- quiring the concept GHOST requires that we understand other people's states of mind about religious agencies, which cannot be done unless we identify violations of in- tuitive physics as salient. So "cultural leaxning" based on perspective-taking or theory-of-mind requires the prior contribution of other domain-specific capacities. The same remarks apply to other proposals for a "capac- ity for culture," based on "meta-cultural" understandings. For instance, Talmy (1995) suggests that special "meta- cultural" dispositions allow humans to (1) identify certain behaviors as common in their own groups, (2) contrast them with other groups', and (3) favor imitation of the for- mer. Without denying that there are such dispositions, I would claim that they are insufficient to explain actual re- currence. This is because, as I said above, understanding other people's thoughts (or values or choices) does not just depend on meta-representational capacities, but also on in- tuitive understandings of the domains concerned. I do not wish to deny that conformity or peer-pressure or other "meta-cultural factors" exist. But they probably reinforce a</page><page sequence="10">BOYER / CULTURAL INHERITANCE 885 selection of variants governed by the interaction between cultural input and universal conceptual structures. To sum up, then, cultural acquisition is content-specific. Intuitive ontologies provide domain-specific principles, which apply only to particular aspects of experience. There is no single cultural inheritance track but, rather, a series of domain-specific inheritance tracks. The dynamical proper- ties of different acquisition tracks will probably vary as a consequence of which domain-specific capacities or prin- ciples are activated. A sector of cultural input that activates intuitive psychology, for instance, may have a dynamic that is significantly different from one that triggers biologi- cal inferences. The study of cognitive tracks, then, does not lead to an over-arching "theory of culture" but to a series of predic- tions about specific domains of culture. That a repre- sentation is "cultural" does not refer to special functional properties of that representation. It only means that (roughly) similar representations are entertained by other members of a group. In each conceptual domain nothing particular is required to build cultural representations over and above what is required to build noncultural ones. Indi- vidual concept-building sometimes results in similar struc- tures in different individuals but often does not. We do not need to postulate a capacity that would explain the acquisi- tion of cultural representations and only those. "Cultural Fitness" with Independent Evidence The present "multiple cognitive tracks" model addresses the question, How do people acquire culture? by re-exam- ining cultural understandings in the wider context of con- ceptual acquisition in general. The aggregation of individ- ual processes of recall and inference may be sufficient to explain recurrence and to make specific predictions about "cultural fitness." This is understood as the likelihood that a particular representation found at generation n will be found, in some roughly similar version, at n + 1. As Dur- ham points out, it is difficult to avoid tautological accounts where the cultural fitness of representations is construed as equivalent to its actual spread (Durham 1991:194). So the model ends up saying that what actually stayed had more "staying power" than what did not. An account of cultural acquisition can make meaningful predictions about cultural fitness only if it is based on inde- pendent evidence. Consider the following hierarchy of ce- teris paribus predictions for the "cultural fitness" of repre- sentations: [P1] Representations have "cultural fitness" to the ex- tent that they trigger an enrichment of skeletal pnnciples of intuitive ontology; [P2] Representations that do not realize [P1] are fit to the extent that they (i) have attention-grabbing potential and that (ii) all relevant nonviolated principles can be acti- vated; [P3] Representations that realize neither [P1] nor [P2] have fitness inasmuch as there is matenal support for their meta-representation . There are good "proximate explanations" (detailed causal accounts) and independent psychological evidence for each of the predictions. [P1] is supported by many as- pects of conceptual development. Concepts that identify kinds among superordinate categories (e.g., TIGER as a "kind-of" ANIMAL) are more easily identified than con- cepts that cut across ontological categories; and concepts that identify empty placeholders in intuitive expectations (e.g., MOMENTUM as "what stays inside things you pushed and keeps them moving") are readily acquired too. Prediction [P2] is supported by evidence for the easy acti- vation of "default-logic" in many domains, for example, in the representation and storage of episodes and scripts (Graesser et al. 1980). Prediction [P3] is illustrated, among other domains, by experimental and anthropological stud- ies of educational processes, showing, for instance, how meta-representational support is required for recall of com- plex non-intuitive material. This is all evidence for individual processes of acquisi- tion and recall. [P1-3] are likely consequences of the ag- gregation of such individual processes, assuming that what is more likely acquired and recalled by an individual is more likely found in group-wide distributions. Obviously, this is an idealization, as many other factors contribute to actual spread. However, this account explains some impor- tant features of these different domains of acquired culture. For instance, there are many cross-cultural similarities in such domains as foLk psychology, number, kinship catego- ries. This should be expected. These are all domains where cultural representations are maximally constrained, since (prediction [P1]) input is attended to only if it enriches uni- versal intuitive principles. Also, these are domains where cultural acquisition is effortless, indeed often "invisible" to the people concerned. Contrast this with religious repre- sentations, for instance. Here, too, acquisition is effortless, but there is more cultural variation in detailed repre- sentations and some recurrence in underlying principles. This would result from prediction [P2]. Violations of intui- tive ontology can take many different forms, although their underlying assumptions are limited by the limitations of in- tuitive ontology itself. Finally, it is obvious that systematic speculation, explicit cultural "theories," and science are never acquired effortlessly by mere exposure to cultural in- put. They always require dedicated institutions, where re- peated instruction can take place. To sum up, interaction between vastly variable input and universal intuitive ontol- ogy is only one aspect of cultural acquisition, but an impor- tant one, and a good predictor of cultural fitness. Explaining acquired culture in an evolutionary framework, then, is not just an abstract, theoretically coherent possibil- ity. It requires that we identify proximate connections be- tween evolutionary history and recurrent representations.</page><page sequence="11">886 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST * VOL. 100, NO. 4 * DECEMBER 1998 An empirically precise, independently supported descrip- tion of conceptual development can provide such proxi- mate connections. Conceptual development is governed by evolved predispositions and govetns inferences from cul- tural input. Intuitive ontology is only one aspect of this process, but a particularly importarlt one in the central do- mains of cultural anthropology. Notes Acknowledgments. The general cognitive conception of cul- ture presented here owes much to long-lasting intellectual ex- changes with Dan Sperber, Scott Atran, and Larry Hirschfeld, certainly more than mere references would indicate. Com- ments on previous versions of this article by Leda Cosmides, John Tooby, and Stephen Mithen helped me better describe the connections between evolution and acquired culture. I am grateful to Robert Sussman and three anonymous referees for many helpful comments and suggestions. 1. Preschoolers project biological properties to different animal kinds in terms of their intuitive taxonomic proximity to humans, with "decreasing attribution [of such properties as 'breathes, sleeps, gets hurt, has a heart, eats'] as the animals become more dissimilar to people" (Carey 1985:79). 2. This is illustrated in Keil's studies of predicate-spanning (Keil 1979). Preschoolers seem to assume that something de- scribed as "dreaming" may also be described as "hungry" and "heavy," but not as "made of metal" (while a similar inference cannot be made from "heavy" to "hungry" or from 'hungry" to "dreaming"). The intuition is stable even when the subjects have no conceptual knowledge of the object in question, for instance with novel or imaginary lexical labels (Keil 1986). 3. For instance, see Springer and Keil (1991): Children as- sume that color-inheritance is a natural process in animals but is created by human intentions in artifacts. Also, features that have functional consequences are construed as inheritable more readily than features with no functional consequences. This is especially the case if the functions are biological rather than social or psychological (Springer and Keil 1989:637). 4. Some counter-intuitive religious assumptions can be- come totally routinized; for instance, none in the West would find it terribly surprising if they were told that ghosts can walk through walls. The point here is that familiarity on the one hand and counter-intuitive quality on the other are orthogonal. However banal the assumption that ghosts can walk through walls, it still violates some principles concerning the behavior of solid objects and the fact that agents are solid physical ob- Jects. 5. Incidentally, this is a confusion for which intuitive on- tology is partly responsible. From preschool age we routinely use loose (and convenient) ways of speaking in which objects and their representations are confused. Preschoolers can un- derstand utterances such as "you broke my Elvis Presley" (where "doll representing" is implicit) or "I'll eat your turtle" (with implicit "chocolate representation ofb') as perfectly sen- sible, because they know the implications of the relation REP- RESENTATION-OF. Such loose ontological talk is pervasive in everyday life and has disastrous philosophical conse- quences, if taken literally. 6. Again, this is not just a characteristic of science. Con- sider the participants in Barrett and Keil's (1996) experiments (see section above, "Counter-Intuitive Representations"). They use both an explicit "non-intuitive" theological concept of God, developed in theological schools and transmitted through explicit teaching, and an intuitive concept of God as an intentional agent, although these two concepts support op- posite inferences.
