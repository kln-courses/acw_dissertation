<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME LII, No. 14 JULY 7, 1955 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SHELDON'S SYNTHETIC METAPHYSICS DROFESSOR Sheldon has known better than most contemporary 1philosophers the art of surveying reality from an inclusive point of view. In a number of previous valuable volumes he has argued for a synthetic metaphysics which finds its full expression in his recent major work, God and Polarity.' Sheldon's thesis is that metaphysical systems "are in the main correct-except when they think they have refuted the others. It may be that if the onlooker would dig beneath the surface, he would see that the quarrels are needless, that each type of metaphysics has shown its truth-though not always in the way it supposes-that the warring factions can pool their results without any being relegated to in- ferior grade. " 2 As long as philosophers continue their exclusive love and mutual refutations, their quest "cannot command the respect of earnest souls who have the good of humanity deeply at heart; nor does it deserve the same." 3 Philosophers must set their house in order. United "they may stand, divided they must fall." 4 Sheldon in developing this high purpose presents one of the most impressive contemporary metaphysical systems. It is rich in insights and vast in scope. I shall first state his meta- physics in large outline, and then estimate some of his basic ideas. I In his enterprise to develop a synthetic metaphysics Sheldon first attempts to determine the criterion of reality. What is the test or procedure that will get at the external reality? Modern philoso- phy, according to him, has created an impasse through its intense epistemological interest, an interest he considers unnatural. Pure contemplation of reality, mere analysis of sensations, and, more recently, the extreme analytic procedure of analysis of analysis have drawn us farther and farther away from reality and have closed us within a subjective world. These procedures, Sheldon argues, never reach the external world: contemplation cannot go 1 God and Polarity: A Synthesis of Philosophies.

How shall we escape the present predicament? Sheldon makes the fruitful suggestion that in action, as against mere thought or sensation, one is able to escape the subjectivism of the modern epistemologists. In his words, "Action plays the part of door-opener to the outer world of reality." 5 Reality is directly conveyed by action. Seeing is believing, but acting is proving, proving not by reasoning as epistemologists would insist, but by direct experience. The test of reality is not from without, but from within action itself. For common sense this is ultimate. More specifically, action or effort, for Sheldon, is, first of all, always purposive: it always involves some idea, however dim or ambiguous, of what it desires. It is strife for something we want: "to have the car move, to raise the stone, to see the problem's answer, to behave reasonably, to be quiet." 6 Secondly, action is originative. "The unique positive thing about effort is its origin- ality; . . . it is . . . not a datum but a factum, or better still, a fiat, a doing rather than a deed." 7 It is the initiative of a process. Thirdly, action is out-goingness. Action moves away from its own being to the object. Thus its direction is opposite to that of thought. Thought carries meaning inward to the mind; action goes outward to the object. Thought is still, immanent; action is dynamic, transitive. This out-goingness is what gives to action its incalculable import. Finally, action is self-effacing, trans- parent; being increasingly submerged in the object, it is able to witness an independent reality. When slipping down the bank into a lake-to use Sheldon's illustration-one casts about fran- tically for a handhold. One's consciousness is filled with the object-the slippery slope, the lake, the needed holdfast-and not with awareness of what the nature of the experience is. Yet Sheldon, with his synthetic spirit, gives consideration to other aspects of mind in our attempt to reach external reality. Cognition and affection have equally valuable functions in human knowledge. Though action is prior, it is not superior to other phases of mind. Cognition (thought and sensation) gives content to action, adds the what to the that of action; it formulates hy- potheses for the guidance of action; it examines the relation of possibles to actuals; it brings order and coherence to experience.

Action and thought are polar but not opposing powers of mind. The two cooperate on the same level: "in the world they are always together. No mere power, no mere order anywhere in reality. Reality is rational as being orderly; also it has extrarational factors in the midst of its order. " 8 The two are "opposites, not opposed, but counterparts like the poles of a magnet except for the compulsory implication between the mag- netic poles." 9 And these two phases of mind are united in affection. Thought does not compel action. What brings together or induces co6pera- tion between the possible ideals of thought and the doings of action is affection. Sheldon uses Whitehead 's favorite term "lure." Lure works by drawing, not by pushing or forcing. The lure "is the final not the efficient cause; the power of the ef- ficient cause is compelling, of final is the good that lures by its goodness." 10 And we all act on the external world as long as we are alive and have desires to fulfill. Without a lure a man would not act; even though lure does not compel the decision, there would be no decision, no motive to adopt, without it. Yet lure that unites thought and action also promotes each in its singularity." We love action for action's sake, and thinking for thought's sake. To the active-cognitive-affective process Sheldon gives the name " experiment" or "experimental testing." Experiment involves action, thought, and the desire to know. The criterion of reality "is given by action, by experiment." 12 And, again, "reason alone never convinces in respect of reality. Experimental verifica- tion after or with reasoning does convince." 18 "Proof in respect of real things is experimental; it is never merely logical." 14 Sheldon's approach to reality makes clear his interpretation of the nature of reality. First, and foremost, reality is power; it is what resists our efforts. As he expresses it in one of his earlier books, "Reality is primarily that power or those powers which we find we have to respect when we act to gain the ends we need." 15 Or, as stated more succinctly in the present book, "Power is being and being is power." 18 Secondly, reality is order, coherence, though this order need not ignore the chance element in nature. 8 Ibid., p. 111. 9 Ibid., p. 111. 10 Ibid., p. 114. 11 Ibid., p. 121. 12 Ibid., p. 80. is Ibid., p. 81. 14 Ibid., pp. 222-223. 15 America's Progressive rhilosophy, p. 96. 18 God and Polarity, p. 38.</page><page sequence="4">368 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY So, for Sheldon, "reality is" to a degree "diffuse, indeterminate.

'17 Finally, reality is value, value in the sense that whatever is real "is good or bad so far as it fulfills or frustrates wants or innate trends, whether of itself or other things. " 18 Thus, in final description, " Reality . .. is power, order, and value." "I Having prepared the ground for the approach to reality, Sheldon surveys the enduring metaphysical systems and through his ex- perimental method determines their insights. This section, which forms the major part of the book, is an invaluable contribution to current philosophy. Major philosophic systems are analyzed thoroughly, critically, and at the same time generously-a pro- cedure quite different from that of the current refutationists. The analysis of different schools is primarily philosophical rather than historical. And what is also significant is that each philosophical system is placed within its larger, world setting. Indian and Chinese philosophic ideas find adequate expression in his discus- sion. Yet despite his basically synthetic attitude, certain schools, such as Thomism for instance, are analyzed with deep affection, whereas others, like materialism and contemporary analysis, are rather harshly treated. Of these two systems he can hardly be said to have presented the inner elan. Should not his principle of polarity have led him to do greater justice to the analysts, for instance, whose school he should have regarded as being the op- posite of, rather than opposing, the school of synthetic philosophy? Sheldon's survey of systems arrives at the following grand re- sult. Monistic idealism proves the existence of a Supreme Spirit, "perfect so far as man can see, source of utmost bliss. The proof is given in the mystical experiment." 20 Even when "the idealists did not perform the experiment but relied only on a rational argu- ment . . . that argument irrespective of its soundness has been verified by the expeiriment." 21 Pluralistic idealism proves the ultimate reality of conscious personal minds from "the fact that we have to conduct our lives by accepting that reality." 22 Ma- terialism rightly affirms that material beings are ultimate, ir- reducible to mental terms. We all have to adapt ourselves to 17 Ibid., p. 105. 18 Ibid., p. 123. 19 Ibid., p. 123. 20 Ibid., p. 667. 21 Ibid., p. 667. 22 Ibid., p. 668.</page><page sequence="5">SHELDON'S SYNTHETIC METAPHYSICS 369 physical nature if we are to live. Thomism, a truly synthetic system for Sheldon, assimilates the truths of idealism and mate- rialism. And in addition to its doctrine of Divine existence it asserts the levels of being. It also asserts such pairs as essence and existence, substance and accident, act and potency. Process- philosophy emphasizes the import of time and emergentism as opening the door to higher values. Existentialism asserts the extrarational or irrational in existence and in the conative-af- fective aspect of mind. Having stated the positive insights of the major metaphysical systems, Sheldon has now to weave these insights into an original synthetic system of his own. He accomplishes this task through the principles of polarity and grades of being. The first principle concerns primarily the particular things themselves, while the second concerns primarily the general spread of things in a sort of hierarchy. First, the principle of polarity. For Sheldon polarity is the most pervasive specific trait of reality. He gives the following definition of polarity: "One or another phase, aspect, relation, event or entity and its counterpart, each peculiar to the other alone, its counterpart; the two opposite as it were in direction, in way of acting, yet each capable of fruitful cooperation with the other, also of opposing, denying or frustrating it, having thus a degree of independence and a being of its own, and between the two a trend or lure to cooperation in which one of the partners takes the initiative and the other responds, yet each freely; the relation has a certain asymmetry.' 23 Time-space, essence-exist- ence, actual-possible, structure-process, cause-chance, inorganic- organic, body-mind, male-female, value-fact are illustrations of polarity. Second, the principle of grades of being. This principle is based on that of plenitude. Sheldon finds a tendency in nature to realize all possibles and also a drift to go from the simplest to the most inclusive beings, each "including the powers of the level next below yet adding a new contribution of its own not quite reducible to terms of the other."1 24 Being has degrees, but not being just as existence, but existence realizing potencies, essences, which may be distinguished as greater or smaller. So "degree of being is degree of value." 25 God is the Supreme Being, in whom essence and existence are at their fullest. And for Sheldon the existence 28 Ibid., p. 674. 24 Ibid., p. 702. 25 Ibid., p. 703.</page><page sequence="6">370 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY of God is certain on the basis of the First Cause Argument, though to this argument he adds his own subtle ontological argument. He also considers the mystical experience as an experimental proof of the existence of God. Sheldon takes insights from all the great historic and con- temporary systems. His theism is Thomistic; his theory of levels of being and, up to a point, his theory of organic unity of reality are Hegelian; his defense of body and mind is dualistic, his at- titude toward chance as well as toward causality is pluralistic; his insistence on time and emergence brings him close to process- philosophy; his insistence on the extrarational is existential. Ali these ideas are woven into an impressive and original synthetic philosophy. II Now that I have given a description of Sheldon's metaphysics, I shall examine some of his key ideas: his methodology, his theories of reality, polarity, and grades of being, and his con- ception of synthesis. 1. Method. Despite Sheldon's sharp comments on the meth- odologists, he himself gives considerable attention to ways of knowing reality and offers fruitful suggestions on this subject. For him, as earlier mentioned, action opens the door to reality, and cognition and affection also play a role in the final construc- tion of knowledge. It is the joint operation of the three that for him constitutes experimentalism. It would not be incorrect to say that he advocates experimentalism as the most adequate method in our pursuit of knowledge. In this connection he frequently mentions his affinity to the pragmatists and espe- cially to Dewey. And while reading his book one becomes aware not only of private, inaccessible experiences, which he so strongly emphasizes, but even more of an outdoor reality and varied human activities. I presume Sheldon would like to be called an extrovert rather than an introvert philosopher. And to a high degree he is. In discussing his theory of method I shall refer to two issues: the relation of action to external reality, and the applicability of experimentalism to various specific areas of reality. (a) The first question to be considered is: Does Sheldon's method break the epistemological impasse, which he so vividly describes, and give us the external world without any modifica- tion, that is, as it is, the thing in itself? His approach to this problem in terms of action is most fruitful. Of course, as epistemo-</page><page sequence="7">SHELDON'S SYNTHETIC METAPHYSICS 371 logical difficulties crowd in upon him in the form of experiences of error, dream, and illusion, he dismisses them with a fiat by main- taining that reality is directly given by action. Action is proving by direct experience. For him there is no criterion for the reality of the external world from without, the test is found within action itself. Accepting his approach to this problem as a fruitful one, the one issue I wish to raise is: Is action ever so transparent, so self-effacing, so submerged in the external object as to give the independent reality directly, untainted by any modification? This claim he fails to establish fully. In every type of action, as Sheldon himself suggests, thought comes into the picture. The that of action is clothed, interpreted, and classified in terms of the what of thought. It is true that we can distinguish between so-called hard, independent facts of reality and the classification to which we subject them; yet these very facts are themselves partly the resultant of prior classification. At no stage of our endless pursuit of knowledge of reality are we ever free of choosing some mode of interpretation; and our series of choices is involved in what we may ultimately mean by reality. Strictly our knowledge is about facts rather than of fact. To say, therefore, as Sheldon does, that through action we can reach "things as they are in themselves" is not what the experimentalist tells us. Rather, reality, facts, or "tthings in themselves" are ideals, in the sense that they are the ideal limits in our endless process of approximation to truth; and the distinction between appearance and reality is the distinction between the less and the more real. (b) The second question that needs consideration is: To what extent does Sheldon apply the experimental method-which he claims he does-to establish his specific philosophic claims? On this issue his procedure raises several doubts, since he uses the experimental method in a somewhat Pickwickian way. Some- times experimentalism is given such a wide meaning that its ap- plicability tends to become irresponsible; at other times the con- sequences of experimental procedure are refused; and at still other times attempts are made to establish existential claims by the method of pure rationalism, despite the fact that he so vigorously and rightly criticizes this procedure. To exemplify his too wide meaning of experimentalism: "Monist idealism has proved the existence of a Supreme Spirit, perfect so far as man can see, source of utmost bliss. The proof is given in the mystical experiment." 26 And if one asks in what way 26 Ibid., p. 660.</page><page sequence="8">372 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY mysticism proves this claim, his answer is: "Look at the results: that is the answer." That the mystic experiences bliss may be unshakable. From this fact Sheldon draws the conclusion that the mystic's assertions about the Supreme Spirit are true. But is not Sheldon too closely identifying the mystic's actual experi- ence with the latter's interpretation of this experience? Mysti- cism is certainly open to a more empirical interpretation, that is, in terms of values within the verifiable setting of human nature, human culture, and nature. Sheldon's frequent attempt to identify experimentalism with beliefs that have beneficial consequences makes experimentalism an unmanageable procedure. If experi- mentalism is to be a responsible procedure, it must deal with publicly verifiable hypotheses. And let us turn now to Sheldon's refusal to accept the conse- quences of experimental procedure in relation to certain issues in spite of his insistence that he is adhering to experimentalism. In dealing with the problem of knowledge of other minds, he offers us these heartening words: " . . . the certainty of other minds is to be guaranteed in the same experimental or practical way as is the certainty of the external physical world." 27 But feeling some- what uneasy about the consequences of this procedure, he im- mediately adds to this statement: "with a difference added, yes, but a difference only in the manner and motive of the experi- ment.' " 28 What, then, is the nature of other minds ? Other minds are "private, hidden" experiences. All we can do is go around them. The analogy Sheldon uses is that other minds are like the vacuole in the continuous protoplasm of a living cell: a hole in- deed that can 't be crossed, but that nevertheless can be gone around. If other minds are to be determined experimentally, why resort to procedures which are by definition inaccessible to private realms? What is open to verification is behavior, so that if one is to take the experimental procedure seriously, why not say that mind is behavior? A thing is what it does. One need not deny the private aspect of other minds, nor need this be inaccessible forever, since it should become increasingly open to empirical in- vestigation. Finally, there is Sheldon's resort to pure rationalism in estab- lishing existential propositions. Though he approves what he calls experimental verification of the existence of God in terms of mystical experience, he also revives the ontological argument. Though, rather ingeniously, he formulates the ontological argument 27 Ibid., p. 127. 28 Ibid., p. 127.</page><page sequence="9">SHELDON'S SYNTHETIC METAPHYSICS 373 in more objective terms than usual, yet in the end he derives God from His essence. As Sheldon puts it: " . . . God Himself is the necessary being. Which means that His being can be accounted for, deduced; His very nature makes Him exist." 29 If Sheldon admits that deductive arguments can prove existential truths, why should he be so critical, as he rightly is, of the rationalistic tradi- tion ? 2. Reality. Being primarily a metaphysician, Sheldon is in- terested in methodology because it enables him to make a map of reality and to formulate principles that can guide one in life. He has found that reality has three general traits: power, coherence, and value. Power, for him, is the primary trait of reality. It is possible for coherence and value to be in the realm of pure possibles without being actuals. There are different modes of power: physical, vital, mental, and divine. The first thing to be noted is that his notion of power does not imply universal "anthropomorphism." It is true that sometimes we meet resistance from other wills than our own, but, as Sheldon points out, there is nothing in the re- sistance offered by physical objects to suggest that they have feel- ings, still less conscious purposes. Secondly, his notion of power does not hypostatize power as an agency over and above process or action itself. Reality as power means resistance, process, action, doing something. A thing is what it does, and one might add, what it can potentially do. The notion of power as doing something applies to everything. In Sheldon's words: "A man is what he does. His worth lies in what he makes. . . . so we all believe when we conduct our lives in intercourse with one another and with nature." 30 Does Shel- don follow the consequences of his notion of power as a definition of reality? Not always. If he had done so, his philosophy would have been much nearer to a naturalistic process-philosophy, like Dewey's, without the body-mind and nature-supernature dualisms. Applying Sheldon's definition of reality as power one should say: Matter is that testable process which makes one call things physical; life is that testable process or activity which makes one call it alive; mind is that testable activity which makes one call it mental. These different modes of reality are different modes of testable power. There is, therefore, no necessity when describing mind or nature, as Sheldon does, to assume something over and above action or behavior. Mind is what mind does; it is behavior, or 29 Ibid., p. 527. 30 Ibid., p. 31.</page><page sequence="10">374 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY rather a specific type of behavior. Nature is what nature does; there is no need of referring to some supreme agency or a First Cause to explain nature. Reality is, also, coherence, up to a point. Sheldon as synthetic metaphysician wants to do justice to order and contingency, to causality and chance in nature. He maintains that in order to live, to carry out our plans, we must have a belief in the uniformity of nature, and that in order to realize our ideals of progress and morals we must have a belief in chance, not chance in the negative sense as the mere denial of causal necessity but chance in the posi- tive sense that all possibles tend to be actualized. How shall we reconcile these two demands? Sheldon suggests that the statistical view of the laws of nature reconciles these two demands: it pro- vides sufficient uniformity and sufficient opportunity for chance. This view is appealing and many contemporary distinguished scientists and philosophers argue for a somewhat similar view. Especially in the light of recent developments in physics, such as quantum mechanics, the statistical view of the laws of nature has attained wide acceptance. The issues involved here are too intricate to be analyzed in passing. Yet one may offer the sugges- tion that the scientist's demand for an increasingly deterministic image of nature and the moralist's demand for a view of nature that increasingly allows genuine possibility and freedom need not be incompatible. For certain purposes the events of experience may be classified in a deterministic way, for other purposes in a statistical way. The issue, as Sheldon rightly argues, is an em- pirical one, but one has to pursue one's empirical investigations in the light of certain demands or ideals. And the demand for more and more precision is an abiding ideal of science. Finally, reality is value. One certainly cannot disagree with Sheldon when he claims that reality is the source of our desires, hopes, and aspirations. In this sense one may speak of reality as value. (Sheldon, of course, equally emphasizes the relation of possibilities to value. As he puts it, "Possibles make progress possible. ") But Sheldon's claim about reality as value goes further. For him, anything that fulfills its potency has intrinsic value. "Efficient and final cause both hold of each and every event throughout nature, so far as the event succeeds in realizing its latent trends or potencies." 31 The using of concepts like func- tion, purpose, final cause, and teleology is practicable in relation to artifacts, instruments, living beings, human beings, and social groups; but using them in relation to the physical world tends to 31 Ibid., p. 687.</page><page sequence="11">SHELDON'S SYNTHETIC METAPHYSICS 375 make them lose their distinctive meaning. A panpsychist may appropriately apply such teleological concepts to the physical world, but Sheldon is not a panpsychist, in fact he presents one of the most devastating criticisms of panpsychism in current philosophy. His usage is Thomistic, and Thomism is open to the same kind of criticism. 3. Polarity. Sheldon makes much use of the principle of polarity. It is the most original phase of his philosophy. First presented in his book Strife of Systems in 1918, this principle has attained greater clarity and fuller expression in the present book. The principle of polarity has four major traits: the relation of opposites; the trend or lure toward cooperation of opposites; the degree of independence of opposites; and the relation of asym- metry between opposites. The principle of polarity may apply to a single individual or between individuals; in the latter case between an individual of a class and another of a counterpart class or between two individuals of independent classes. The following are illustrations of the polarity principle: the right hand and the left hand, male and female, essence and existence, efficient cause and final cause, the material absorbed by plants and its formation into structure, the nucleus and the cytoplasm of cells, and mind and body in man. The polarity principle, for Sheldon, is primarily ontological. "The pairing principle ... pervades reality. . . . it is practically ubiquitous. . .. it seems to be the most pervasive specific trait in nature; specific as having a unique definable character, distinguish- able, identifiable in the concrete. " 32 Polarity is also a normative principle. "Polarity furnishes the key to the settlement of the great perennial quarrels of types." 33 Polarity lets each type say, "I am right in and by myself, so are you my opposite.... Let us then gladly recognize the truth of each other and cooperate to gain a broader . . . view." I shall consider these two aspects of the polarity principle. First, as an ontological principle. Whether the polarity prin- ciple applies to nature is primarily an empirical question. The events of experience may be classified in many different ways: quantitatively, qualitatively, causally, teleologically, as opposites, as opposed, and so on. The central question in all these various types of classification is: How fruitful or pragmatically justifiable is a given classification in relation to the problem or purpose in- volved? The polarity principle provides us with the possibility 32 Ibid., p. 674. 33 Ibid., p. 677.</page><page sequence="12">376 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY of doing justice to identity and difference, to causality and teleol- ogy, to matter and mind, to unity and plurality. It also helps one to approach and formulate certain significant problems in biology, psychology, and the social sciences. Sheldon's polarity principle is much more fertile and concrete than most of his critics have granted. Yet despite these advantages one cannot say that the polarity principle has the predictive power of causal, statistical, or teleological explanations. And for Sheldon, and rightly so, it is power that counts in the end. In terms of consequences polarity does not seem to have the cosmic significance that he attributes to it. And again, it may be noted that the principle of polarity does not necessarily establish Sheldon's basically dualistic metaphysics. A naturalist, and especially the non-reductive type of naturalist, could equally and as fruitfully use the principle of polarity with- out admitting a deep, dualistic cleavage in reality. Mind and body, for example, are opposites, yet they need not differ in the sense of the dualistic metaphysician but merely as kinds of be- havior. The polarity principle is neutral as far as most meta- physical systems are concerned. By way of analogy one may cite the situation in the second decade of this century when the neo-realists tried to establish some of their ontological doctrines by using the notions of simple terms, asymmetrical relations, and the infinite continuum of sym- bolic logic. Because at that time most philosophers were ignorant of symbolic logic, the arguments of the neo-realists sounded im- pressive and seemed final. Yet it became obvious in time that the categories of symbolic logic, like the categories of calculus, were neutral to metaphysical systems. Or, to put it another way, any metaphysical system could make use of them. Certainly Sheldon makes effective use of the principle of polarity for his synthetic metaphysics, but the door is open to others to make similar use of it for their metaphysics. Polarity, as was said, is also a normative principle. As such it is primarily the principle of synthesis, of inclusiveness, of harmony, of cooperation. It is the mode of regarding other views, other policies, other individuals, or other groups as opposites rather than as opposed. Love, co6peration, inclusiveness are the guiding spirit here. Sheldon applies this principle to his meta- physics, ethics, and social problems. One could apply it to family relations, to educational, economic, and political activities; it could, in short, be applied to every form of activity. Certainly, a great deal can be said in favor of polarity as a normative principle, and Sheldon says it effectively and persuasively. Yet the polarity</page><page sequence="13">SHELDON'S SYNTHETIC METAPHYSICS 377 principle, like all other pervasive principles, has its limitations. There are situations, as in human relations for instance, where one should make more use of the principle of opposing, rather than of opposites. In dealing with moral evil there is a point where one should oppose it, fight it rather than try to assimilate it. It is true that in one sense synthesis, harmony, co6peration are higher principles, yet one must find a place in one's ethics for uncom- promising opposition to evil, for righteous anger, for justified pugnacity. Probably Sheldon would accept this suggestion, for evil is not the opposite of good for him; yet if he does, then polarity should not be taken as the sole universal normative prin- ciple, as he seems to regard it. 4. The Grades of Being. While polarity gives balance, the grades of being mark the aspiration of being. Their basis is the principle of plenitude, which asserts a tendency in nature to realize all possibles. Chance, from this standpoint, does not mean that anything may happen, but rather that in time everything must happen. Being as realization of possibilities has degrees; and degrees of being are degrees of value. Degree is of the essence of value; so it is of being, but not "of being as just existence, only of being as existence realizing potencies; and potencies, essences, these are intrinsically greater or smaller." 34 And the scale of being is such that as it goes from the simplest to the most inclusive, each stage includes the power of the level next below, yet adds a con- tribution of its own that is not quite reducible to the terms of the other. God as the highest form of being is thus the highest good. In this connection Sheldon presents an original version of the ontological argument for the existence of God.35 Since, as he argues, a rational world is one in which all possibilities are equally realizable, then God must exist, for God is the realization of all possibilities in one act of being. In his own words, "If Anselm's 'idea of perfection' were understood as the sum total of all the ultimate possibles and if it were seen that the equal realization of all needs no explanation but is self-explaining, Anselm 's proof would be sound."36 Having established God's existence, we do not stand alone in our struggle for the good. And for Sheldon man's will is ultimately powerless for good without some assurance of God. 34 Ibid., p. 703. 85 First stated in his article on "Another Form of the Ontological Proof," Philosophical Beview, Vol. XXXII (1923), No. 4, pp. 355-372. 36 God and Polarity, p. 527.</page><page sequence="14">378 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Sheldon's theory of the grades of being involves certain issues and difficulties. First, there is a possible alternative to Sheldon's conception that all possibilities are equally realizable. If one as- sumes that the determining conditions of actualities were from eternity, then all possibilities were not realizable but only those that were potential of actualities. Sheldon himself makes clear the distinction between pure possibilities and existential possi- bilities. In the realm of pure possibilities everything is possible; there are no incompatibles, all things are compossible. He even makes a case for round squares.37 The only things that are not compatible are a proposition and its denial, but these are not two things in the sense of qualities, entities, relations, events, or terms. In the realm of existential possibilities there are degrees of pos- sibility: certain things are highly probable; others are possible under favorable conditions; still others are improbable or even impossible. Secondly, even should one grant Sheldon's theory of absolute chance, it does not follow that the grades of being and God, as described by him, actually exist, but only that in time they must exist. The determination of what actually exists is an empirical question. It should also be noted that according to this theory the present mode of being as even God must eventually disappear, since in infinite time all possibilities will have to be realized. What is of value in Sheldon's theory of the grades of being is his emphasis on the rich, qualitative, non-reductive aspect of existence. What is also of great value is his claim, in this con- nection, that "possibles make progress possible." This is true to the extent that human intelligence and action intervene to choose, control, and realize possibilities. All existent things have hidden possibilities, not merely unrealized possibilities but conflicting possibilities. Atomic energy has possibilities for human welfare as well as for human destruction; plants have possibilities for growth as well as for decay; human beings have possibilities for living in mutual respect and co6peration as well as for destroying one another. Progress means realizing more and more ideal pos- sibilities. 5. Synthesis. This aspect of Sheldon's philosophy is in many respects the most important. His book, despite the aulthor 's genuine humility, urbanity, and generous spirit, is metaphysically one of the most ambitious undertakings. In terms of his principles of polarity and grades of being he attempts to formulate a syn- thetic philosophy that will increase one's insight into all major 37 America's Progressive Philosophy, pp. 169-170.</page><page sequence="15">SHELDON'S SYNTHETIC METAPHYSICS 379 metaphysical systems; that will achieve an over-all order in which some independence is allowed among members or phases of reality; that will end the strife of systems and provide a common basis for metaphysics. Has he succeeded in this enterprise? First, it should be pointed out that a synthetic view need not inevitably be a truer view. If there are two possible interpreta- tions of an issue, it does not necessarily follow that the synthetic one is truer than the other; either may be the actually true. In the case of conflict between two philosophic schools, it may be that one of the schools gives a truer account of reality than the other, and there is nothing to guarantee that a synthesis of their con- flicting views would be more nearly true. Nevertheless it must be acknowledged that Sheldon is basically right in claiming that an adequate metaphysics must be synthetic in the sense that it must survey all phases of existence and do justice to all insights, an impartiality that can scarcely be expected of a partisan view. One may admit the truth of Sheldon's major contention that one's philosophy ought to be synthetic. This emphasis is espe- cially desirable at a time when philosophers, particularly in Eng- land and in this country, have been giving too much attention to the analytic phase of philosophy at the expense of its synthetic phase. Yet the question remains whether Sheldon's synthetic metaphysics is an adequate metaphysics, whether his philosophy is acceptable as a common basis for conflicting systems. How can one settle this issue? In the past, synthetic systems were mostly deductive. Starting from certain allegedly self-evident principles, philosophic systems were built out of the implications of these principles. Adequacy meant that the premises were convincingly self-evident and the implications logical. In recent synthetic philosophies, such as Alexander 's, Whitehead 's, or Dewey's, this procedure has been increasingly rejected. They are more empirical and more descrip- tive. Sheldon's metaphysics is basically of this type, though he employs certain guiding principles. And for an empirical meta- physics the final test is not mere logical coherence, though this has its place, but rather the consideration whether the proposed synthetic pattern satisfactorily fits together the different aspects of experience, that is, impresses one with the substantial soundness of the system. On the basis of this test Sheldon's metaphysics is illuminating and highly adequate though not wholly, for many would find it difficult to assimilate within an empirical metaphysics his dualism and supernaturalism. It is not a great misfortune, as Sheldon assumes, that we have, and probably will always have, a variety of philosophic systems.</page><page sequence="16">380 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Ultimately, individual experiences and decisions enter in, which are bound to emphasize one or another approach, one or another major outlook. This does not necessarily mean that we may not gradually move towards a common metaphysical system, but in the face of the infinite complexity and the mystery of existence we can at best offer varied, tentative systems. Yet enlightened action need not wait for a common synthetic philosophy. As long as basic agreements exist in the moral and political spheres, which is quite possible in spite of differences in metaphysical systems, we need not be hampered in common humane action. Yet it must be admitted that, although his synthetic metaphysics may not end the strife of systems, Sheldon has basically succeeded in his great enterprise. He has made us aware of many of our unnecessary exclusive claims; he has also given us a magnificent metaphysical system, probably the most catholic one in co:n- temporary philosophy, a system of great range and of many in- sights and values.
