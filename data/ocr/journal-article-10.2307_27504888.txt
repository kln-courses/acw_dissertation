<plain_text><page sequence="1">W. W. MEISSNER, S. J. Notes on Monotheism Origins The argument, which we have already considered,1 indicated that one of the major suppositions of Freud's approach to the understanding of the evolution of monotheism and, therefore, of religious behavior, was that the doctrine of the one true god, supreme and omnipotent, evolved out of a more primitive religious matrix. Freud endeavored to show that the notion of one god came not directly from primitive religious tradi tions of Israel, but from Egypt through the agency of Moses. Freud, of course, shared the suppositions of the vast majority of biblical scholars of his time. The dominant influence was that of Wellhausen and his school, who extended the influence of Hegel into biblical research. The wealth of archeological data derived from strata in Palestine contemporary with the patriarchal and prepatriarchal eras has com pletely revolutionized the thinking of biblical scholars about these pe riods. While the biblical accounts had previously been thought to be unreliable and highly edited accounts actually reflecting much later religious views, the archeological evidence rather supports the validity and historicity of the biblical accounts. It is our intention here to re examine the emergence of Israelite monotheism in the light of more re cent views. It can be hoped that a fresh approach to this subject will offer a firm basis for a deeper understanding of the psychology of hu man religious existence. The Hebrew traditions, in distinction from other ancient national traditions, preserve a clear impression of their tribal and familial origins. Nothing comparable can be found in Egypt, Babylonia, Assyria, Phoe nicia, Greece, or Rome. In contrast, the Israel traditions preserve a record of simple beginnings, multiple migrations, and a variety of vicis situdes that brought them from a position of favor under Joseph to bit This is the second part of a three-part article.

These accounts have long been regarded as artificial productions of Israelite scribes from the period of the divided monarchy. Genesis 11-50 was regarded as late invention, or at least a retrojection of events under the monarchy into a past that was lost in the obscurity of history. The traditions of Genesis indicate that the ancestors of Israel were related to nomadic and seminomadic peoples who wandered in Arabia and related areas toward the close of the second millennium and the first centuries of the first millennium B.C. Recently excavated inscriptions of Ur support this relationship. According to the Genesis account, the ancestors of Israel derived from Mesopotamia. Abraham's father, Terah, migrated from Ur-Kasdim, the region of the early Babylonian city of Ur, to the region of Harran in northwestern Mesopotamia. The excavations at Ur have yielded cuneiform documents proving that Ur was at the height of its prosperity from about 2070 to i960 B.C., when it was destroyed by the Elamites. The city of Ur was partially restored in the eighteenth century, but it was again utterly devastated in the early seventeenth century, not to be heard from again for centuries. The date of Terah's migration from Ur to Harran will probably never be fixed with certainty, but a date in the third quarter of the twentieth century B.C. would fit the historical data quite well.2 The Hebrew tradition was undoubtedly correct in tracing patri archal origins back to the Balikh valley in northwestern Mesopotamia. The references are explicit to cities like Harran and Nabor, which were flourishing in the nineteenth and eighteenth centuries. The relationship is also indicated in personal, tribal, and divine names. The wealth of data indicates that in Mesopotamia the Hebrews were under mixed Acca dian, Hurrian, and Amorite influence. The Nuzian documents from the fifteenth century B.C. indicate that the customary law found in the patriarchal narratives fits better with the framework of Nuzian social and legal practice than with that of later Israel or of Babylonia of the nineteenth century. The discovery of the Mari documents and related ones from the eighteenth century has added more striking parallels. Of particular importance are the cosmogonie narratives of Genesis 1 11. They are significant in that they bear a close relation to similar ma terial in Assyrian and Babylonian tablets, and show little relation to what is known of Canaanite cosmogony. This cosmogonie material is inex plicable without the supposition that it was brought from Mesopotamia 44 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="3">by the Hebrews before the middle of the second millennium. The now extensive data on Canaanite beliefs and legends reveal nothing compara ble to the Genesis account. Nor is there any parallel in Egyptian litera ture. The Mesopotamian parallels, however, are striking.3 The Mesopotamian religion reflects a striking evolution that is fi nally reflected in the patriarchal traditions of Israel.4 The evolution reflects the deepest concerns of human existence in the course of Meso potamian history. In the fourth millennium, Mesopotamian economy was based on the vagaries of artificial irrigation, subject to the uncer tainties of drought, disaster, and famine. Their gods were correspond ingly gods of agriculture and nature, and their cult had the function of insuring the presence of these deities to provide fertility, produce, and food. In the third millennium, the advance of civilization added a new fear to the fear of starvation: the fear of war and destruction. Protec tion against this new danger was sought in the great walls surrounding their cities, in the collective institutions of security, and the emergence of kings with their awesome power to defend against outside foes and to right wrongs within the community. The element of power and maj esty was transferred to the gods who became not only powers in nature, but powers in human affairs. With the beginning of the second millen nium, the concerns of the individual worshipper began to emerge. His personal fortunes, fears of personal misfortune, and anxieties in disease and suffering come to the fore and add a personal dimension to the re lation with the divine. By his personal fault, he estranges himself from the favor of his personal god, but by confessing his guilt before his god, he can gain forgiveness. The insight that the divine stands for a moral law and bears fruit in the realization of human responsibility is born. In the transition from the second to the first millennium, therefore, Israel emerged in a period in which the concept of a divinely sanctioned mo rality had already been achieved. It was possible for man to enter into a covenant with god under which he could live collectively in social justice and individually in moral responsibility. To this extent, Israel stands forth as the heir to the religious history of the preceding millennium. Evidence has accumulated suggesting that the early Hebrews were related to the "Apiru" who appear in the cuneiform records of the nineteenth and eighteenth centuries, as well as in the Nuzian, Hittite, and Amarna documents of the fifteenth and fourteenth centuries. They were landless soldiers, freebooters, captives, and slaves of varied ethnic Notes on Monotheism Origins 45</page><page sequence="4">origins. Later on, in Canaanite sources of the fourteenth century, they are described as rebelling against Egyptian authority, often in alliance with Canaanite princes. The question is by no means decided, but an "Apiru" origin would be quite consistent with many details of tradi tional Hebrew history. Albright remarks that these multiple corroborations have led to the rejection of the old critical theory according to which the patriarchal narratives were thought to be retrojections from the ninth to eighth cen tury. However, we cannot rely too heavily on the present forms of the tradition, since conflicting versions appear in various documents de rived from different sources. But the various traditions are so close in form and content that they must reflect different recensions of a com mon national epic that had been handed down from the patriarchal age. The Egyptian sojourn is an essential part of the tradition and must have lasted for a long period. The adoption of Egyptian names presumably reflects this influence. This was possibly the case for Moses himself. The Joseph episode and its subsequent history may in fact reflect a historical nucleus that bears a relation to the Hyksos movement. The Fifteenth Dynasty was followed by a weak foreign dynasty, against which the Theban princes revolted. The revolt persisted until the fall of Avaris under Amosis I in 1560 B.C. The designation "Hyksos" is apparently a corruption of a phrase meaning "chiefs of a foreign country" and is often applied to Palestinian and Syrian chiefs and princes in the literature of the Middle Empire. The Israelites were in fact settled in the area of the Hyksos capital Avaris or Tanis. Ca naanite place names there in the time of the New Empire bear witness to a long period of Semitic occupation. In addition, many of the Hyk sos leaders bore Semitic names. Albright concludes: "In short, it must be considered as practically certain that the ancestors of part of Israel, at least, had lived for several centuries in Egypt before migrating to Palestine."5 In the pre-Mosaic religion of the Hebrews, the chief god of the patriarchs had been Shaddai. Later successive patriarchal generations recognized a deliberate choice of God, a basic and very ancient princi ple that was demonstrated by Alt to be central in shaping the religious traditions. Personal names of the early Hebrews reflect the influence of divine worship. Such names incorporating appellations of the deity were common in pre-Accadian Semitic and are relatively abundant in the 46 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="5">Old Accadian documents from the twenty-fifth to twenty-third cen turies. They became less frequent in time, were more apparent in Old Assyrian records (twentieth to nineteenth centuries), and were abun dant in Amonte nomenclature in the period between 2100 to 1600 B.C. Such names contain a vow or invocation to god, usually uttered by a parent or other authoritative person at the child's birth. Thus, Yacgobh (Jacob) is a short form of Yacgobh'el "May El protect." The evidence suggests two important conclusions. First, the princi pal deity of the pre-Mosaic patriarchs was a mountain god or a god cloaked with mountain imagery. 'El Shaddai was "the god of the mountain." Secondly, the Hebrews, like their Semitic ancestors, had a keen sense of relationship between a patriarchal group and its deity. The deity was thereby actually a member of the clan and could be addressed as "father" or "brother." Albright has rejected the notion of an El monotheism among early Western Semites.6 El was probably a father-god in early Hebrew popular traditions. A son, Shaddai, appears as a form of storm god. Whether the distinction between El and Shad dai was sharply drawn is questionable. The divine appellations of Gene sis 14-35 ^at incorporate the appellation El are certainly pre-Israelite. The primary names are 'el colam, 'el celyon, 'el Shaddai. Cross has reviewed the data pertaining to these names and draws the following conclusions: 1. It is highly likely, if not certain, that the biblical epithet 'el colam must be interpreted as a liturgical title of 'El meaning originally "El, lord of Eternity" or "El, the Ancient One." Such names are also characteristic designations of the god 'El in Canaanite myths and liturgies. 2. 'El celyon must mean "creator of heaven and earth" in Genesis 14: 18 and may be construed as "the god cElyon, creator." 'El was the cre ator god of Ugarit and Canaan, and the origin of this appellation must be sought in the cult of the Canaanite El. 3. Exodus 6:2 explicitly identifies the god of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as 'El Shaddai. The shaddai element seems to mean "the moun tain one" and to be related to other West Semitic divine epithets known from Ugaritic sources. The shaddai seems to refer to the cosmic mountain. Shaddai may be an epithet of Bacl?Hadad, but this makes it difficult to understand the identification in Israelite tradition of 'El Shaddai with Yahweh. It cannot be established whether Shaddai was an old Amorite deity, brought to Palestine by the patriarchs and early Notes on Monotheism Origins 47</page><page sequence="6">identified by them with the Canaanite 'El, or whether Shaddai was orig inally a cultic epithet of the Canaanite 'El.7 The biblical traditions regarding the God of the Fathers actually represent pre-Mosaic religious ideas. The names derived from the earli est sources, "God of Abraham," "Kinsman of Isaac," "Champion of Jacob" in particular, are of authentic patriarchal origin. Each patriarch is represented as choosing his own god for himself, and in so doing selecting a different manifestation of Yahweh, the later god of Israel. The combination of this individualistic perspective with the belief in the relationship between the clan and its god were primary elements that put a special stamp on the religion of the patriarchs. The name "Yahweh" is identified in both the Elohistic and Priestly traditions with the god of the patriarchs and specifically with 'El Shad dai in the Priestly tradition (Exodus 6:2). The relationship between Yahweh and 'El remains a problem. Certainly the 'El epithets continue to be used throughout the history of Israel as proper names of Yahweh at the same time as a ferocious antagonism was being directed toward the Bacl, the primary deity of Syria in the first millennium. The cult of 'El was popular in the Semitic communities of Sinai, Egypt, and Seir. Further, the rapid unification of cult in the formation of the twelve tribe league suggests some form of prior cultic unity between the Pales tinian descendants of the patriarchs and the disparate elements invad ing Canaan from the desert. Further evidence for the relation of the Canaanite 'El and the Israelite Yahweh is found in the fact that traits and functions of 'El appear as the traits and functions of Yahweh in the earliest Israelite traditions.8 The appearance of Moses on this religiocultural background was undoubtedly an event of unmistakable significance. In all of the penta teuchal traditions, Moses stands forth as a dominant figure. The tradi tion, including Christian tradition, credited the composition of the entire Pentateuch to Moses. But modern scholarship has revealed a va riety of style, disruptions of sequence, and narrative repetitions that preclude a single author. Following Wellhausen, the Pentateuch has been regarded as an amalgam of four documents, all much later than the time of Moses. There were initially two narrative sources, the Yahwistic (J), which uses the divine name Yahweh that was given to Moses, and the Elohistic (E), which uses the common name for God, Elohim. J was committed to writing in Judah in the tenth century B.C., and E fol 48 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="7">lowed suit a little later in Israel. After the fall of the Northern Kingdom (after the fall of Samaria in 722 B.C.), J and E were combined. After the period of Josiah, the Deuteronomic (D) source was added, and the Priestly Code (P), made up for the most part of laws with a smattering of narrative, was joined to the existing compilation (JED) after the exile. The redactional steps by which the Deuteronomic and Priestly traditions were later joined to JE are still matters of scholarly debate, but it is clear that the entire Pentateuch had reached its present form by the period of the exile or shortly thereafter. It has also become apparent from our growing archeological awareness that many of the penta teuchal laws and institutions had nonbiblical counterparts long before the dates assigned to these documents. There can be little question that the basic substance of the Penta teuch, its recorded traditions and legislation, go back to the origins of Israel. Moses was the organizing spirit, the primary legislator and leader of this movement, and the events surrounding his emergence compose the substance of the national epic. There is little to support Freud's premise that Moses was an Egyp tian, although the name is Egyptian. Most biblical scholars agree that in all probability, placing greater reliance on the historicity of the Exodus account, he was a Hebrew born and raised in Egypt. Here again our in creased knowledge of topography and archeology have lent consider able support to the historicity of these accounts. Even the date of the exodus can be fixed within reasonable limits. In 1937, an inscription dated 1221 B.C. was discovered in the ruins of the latest Canaanite Lachish; it proved that the town fell to the Israelites around that time. The stele of Marniptah, dated 1219 B.C., also proves that the Israelites were in western Palestine in some force. Allowing for the "generation" that Israelite tradition demands, the date of the exodus cannot be later than 1250 B.C. Allowing for the occupation of eastern Palestine and the move westward, Albright argues for a date early in the thirteenth century, probably around 1280 B.C.9 The god of Moses was Yahweh. The name has been variously inter preted, but seems best to carry the somewhat abstract connotations of existence and/or causality?"He Who is," "He Who causes to be." The name may in fact be no name?Yahweh is above naming and beyond understanding. In any case, the Israelites certainly regarded him as the source and creator of all things. Moreover, he was unique in that he Notes on Monotheism Origins 49</page><page sequence="8">stood alone, without family connections, consort, son, or daughter. Nor was he restricted to any dwelling place. He was lord of all cosmic forces, who dwelt, if anywhere, in heaven, and could appear or manifest himself anywhere. The theophany of Exodus 19 was likely influenced by recollections of volcanic eruptions combined with the memory of thunder storms in the mountains of northwestern Arabia or Syria. A fundamental aspect of early Israelite traditions and the Mosaic religion was the anthropomorphic conception of Yahweh. Yahweh is always referred to in a human form, although this form was always hidden in his "glory" (Kabod). He also has a very human psychology? he loves and is angered, feels revenge and remorse. To be sure, such concepts reflect the primitive and perhaps polytheistic origins of the Israelite religion (see for example Genesis 18 and 19). On the other hand, it seems reasonable that this anthropomorphism had a functional aspect as well. If Yahweh was to be a god of the individual Israelite as well as of the community, it was essential that he be a god to whom the individual worshipper could look for understanding and sympathy, a god whom he could both love and fear. As Albright remarks: ... it was precisely the anthropomorphism of Yahweh which was essential to the initial success of Israel's religion. Like man at his noblest the God of Israel might be in form and affective reactions, but there was in Him none of the human frailties that make the Olympian deities of Greece such charming poetic figures and such unedifying examples. All the human characteristics of Israel's deity were exalted; they were projected against a cosmic screen and they served to interpret the cosmic process as the expression of God's creative word and eternally active will.10 Another striking characteristic of the cult of Yahweh was the pro hibition against his representation in any visible or tangible form. Pre sumably this rigid aniconism was calculated to separate the cult of Yahweh from the iconistic cults of the other gods of neighboring na tions. It also had the force of underlining the immediacy of relationship between Yahweh and the people of Israel. One of the important problems in understanding the origins of the Mosaic religion has been the derivation of the ethical, civil, and cere monial laws attributed in the later tradition to Moses. Alt's monu mental work11 distinguished between two forms of pentateuchal legis lation, apodictic versus casuistic law. Casuistic laws, e.g., Exodus 21-23, are legal codes similar to the Code of Hammurabi or the Hittite and 50 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="9">Assyrian laws. They derive their form from Sumerian jurisprudence of the third millennium. The apodictic laws, however, are unique and original in Israel. They do not appear in other parts of western Asia and are best illustrated by the Ten Commandments. These apodictic laws have a strikingly categorical character that sets them apart from the most closely related parallel, the Egyptian Negative Confession and the Babylonian Shurpu?the Israelites are commanded to avoid sin pre cisely because this is the will of Yahweh. Moreover, they reflect a more advanced standard of conduct than these extrabiblical counterparts. The assumption that the original "teaching" (torah) of Moses may have contained Egyptian elements is entirely consistent with his origins and social position in Egypt. The absence of direct documentation and the complex pattern of borrowing from Egyptian sources make any conclusions somewhat speculative, but certain elements show striking relations to the worship of Aten. One element is the concept of a god who is the sole creator of all things. Another is the emphasis on one god and the establishing of a doctrine based on strict monotheism. There is also the recognition that such a deity must necessarily be international, cosmic, and universal. On the other hand, it is also clear that the religion of Israel violently rejected almost every other aspect of Egyptian re ligion. The complex iconography, the preoccupation with magic, the materialistic conception of the after-life, all found little or no place in the religion of Israel. There seems to be good reason, on the other hand, to believe that the native Hebrew religion exerted a strong influence on the religion of Moses. The amount that was accepted by him as opposed to what was later introduced into Yahwism from older traditions after his death will remain insoluble. Hebrew influences can clearly be discerned in the notion of close association between deity and worshipper, in the char acteristics of the contractual relationship between the deity and his people (illustrated primarily in the notion of the "covenant"), the asso ciation of the deity with natural manifestations in storms and volcanic eruptions, the identification of Yahweh with 'El Shaddai and with the god of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. While there is obviously much in the foregoing reconstruction that is more speculative than demonstrable historical fact, the picture of emergent monotheism is quite different from that required by the Well hausen-Freud suppositions. It seems more than likely that the religion Notes on Monotheism Origins 51</page><page sequence="10">of the patriarchs had its origins in the milieu of Mesopotamian religious thought. The migration to Palestine brought many of the finest inspira tions of Mesopotamian religion with it. The patriarchs evolved a highly personalistic, clan-oriented, and family-based form of religion. The deities who emerged from this unique matrix were the gods of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and especially the 'El Shaddai. The worship of 'El in the pre-Israelite tradition seems to reflect strong influences of the Ca naanite worship of 'El. While this evolution reflects uniquely Semitic characteristics, nowhere in this tradition can an unequivocal monothesim be demonstrated. Even the Yahwistic formulas, which were introduced with the Mosaic reformulation, cannot be interpreted in any stronger sense than the concept of 'El with whom Yahweh was identified. The formulas reveal increasing consciousness of the monotheistic inspiration as the development of the Mosaic religion progressed. In the formulas of the Yah wist tradition (J) several centuries after the time of Moses, the self-conscious monotheism of the Israelite religion seems se cure. In the light of this later emergence and clarification, the earlier traditions take on a new meaning. At this point in our knowledge, how ever, we cannot be certain that the teaching of Moses, however influ enced by the cult of Aten, was that of a monotheism in the same un equivocal sense as the later tradition. As Albright remarks: If . . . the term "monotheist" means one who teaches the existence of only one God, the creator of everything, the source of justice, who is equally powerful in Egypt, in the desert, and in Palestine, who has no sexuality and no mythology, who is human in form but cannot be seen by human eye and cannot be represented in any form?then the founder of Yahwism was certainly a monotheist.12 With this panorama of religious development spread before us, let us try to see a little more deeply into its psychic significance. To begin with, the origins of the religious traditions lie buried deep in the prehis torical era. At the most primitive levels of this tradition that are available to us, the gods are forces of nature with which man endeavored to ally himself. Out of a welter of nature gods, there evolved a theology of history and human events that also became the objects of divine guidance and intervention. The nation, the tribe, the clan, or the family served as a basic unit of identification. Each had a relation to a deity who served the interests of the community. For the seminomadic clans of the desert, of whom the Apiru and perhaps the Hebrew patriarchs are 5 2 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="11">representative, the deity preserved a special relation to the clan or family. He was addressed in terms of kinship and he was the special god by reason of this relationship who provided for the prosperity and welfare of his clan. This primitive animism gives way to anthropomorphism. While the religion of the Hebrews preserved certain special elements derived from its Mesopotamian origins, it shared this common pattern of evolution with the nations and divinities that surrounded it. An important feature of this evolution is that the participation of god in the life of the clan was based on a kin relationship, which meant, of course, that god bore characteristics that were common to the clan. They were not character istics foreign to the clan. This made it possible for the individual mem ber of the clan to allay his fears and anxieties by securing the active and protective intervention of the god-father of his clan. On an altogether different level, and in all probability evolving pari passu with the increasing socialization of tribal life, man became in creasingly aware of another source of anxiety and destructiveness: his own instinctual drives. The upsurge of libido and aggression were provocative of anxiety, even on a much more primitive level of man's existence than we are now considering. These anxieties must have be come increasingly pertinent, as developing technological and agricul tural skills gave man greater control over his environment. The conflict with nature had diminished its urgency by the time of the patriarchs. There was still the conflict with other hostile nations, and in this regard the gods who supervised the destiny of the clan were extremely im portant. But there was undeniably another force at work in the opera tion of religious behavior. By the time the biblical record begins, the evolution of the religion of the Hebrews had reached a considerably sophisticated level. Out of Mesopotamia had come the fundamental conceptions of individual re sponsibility and guilt, together with the essential association of the moral code with the deity. Except for occasional hints at prebiblical polytheism (Genesis 18-19), the written records indicate a concentra tion on a single deity. At each stage of the tradition, the patriarchal tra dition endorses and takes as its own a single deity. It is not at all clear at the earliest levels of the tradition that the single deity was always the same deity. There is a residual diversity in the tradition that is at once consistent with later theological formulations and capable of monotheis Notes on Monotheism Origins 53</page><page sequence="12">tic interpretation. Yet it is also clear that these early patriarchal tradi tions are not unequivocal and do not provide their own justifications as representing theological monotheism. Yet it is also plain that the later post-Mosaic tradition did interpret these texts and traditions in a monotheistic sense. Apparently, the patriarchs migrated into western Palestine bringing with them a con cept of one god who was peculiarly theirs. The overtones of this belief made it possible for the Hebrews to identify their own Shaddai with the Canaanite 'El. The relationship between 'El and Shaddai are quite com plex and fluid, but it seems adequate to say that a certain amount of syncretistic amalgamation must have taken place through the close asso ciation of the Hebrews and the people of Canaan. Such amalgamation was all the more likely in view of the greater advancement and stability of Canaanite culture in comparison with that of the Hebrews. In any case, out of the welter of interlocking influences and syncretistic inter actions, there emerged a belief in one god, the god of the Fathers, the 'El Shaddai. This was at best an ambiguous monotheism. The term "henotheism" has been proposed to describe this stage of the develop ment of Israelite religion, suggesting that the choice of one god had been made as having special reference to the nation, but that other gods were not denied. The process involved here was only extended and deepened by the intervention of Moses. The revelation of Yahweh through Moses picks up and elaborates and deepens this central dimension. Yahweh is iden tified with 'El Shaddai. The questionable monotheism of the 'El Shaddai casts a parallel doubt on the monotheism of Yahweh. The acts of libera tion and deliverance from the bondage of Egypt and the return to the Promised Land were the works of Yahweh through his servant Moses. The cult of Yahweh was not a replacement of the pre-Mosaic re ligion. It was rather a revision that subsumed the previously existent religious belief into a relatively new synthesis. The new revelation carried with it the specification of Yahweh as the source and creator of all things. But this new formulation was neither a rebuttal nor a rejec tion of the patriarchal formulas. It was precisely this continuity within reformulation that made it possible for a later theological reflection to identify Yahweh with the god of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. What we are describing in inadequate terms is a process of theologi cal reflection and elaboration. The reflection is equivalently a turning 54 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="13">back to the content of the tradition in an effort to find therein the continuities and thereby the origins of contemporary belief. The revela tion of Yahweh took place in a Sitz-ivt-Leben that might not have per mitted the understanding or appreciation of an explicit and frank mono theism. Theological reflection, however, at a remove of several centuries of evolving belief, can look back to the most primitive levels of the extant traditions and find there the origins of its belief. Conceptually, within a theological perspective, the earliest formulations are then seen as obscure, primitive, and somehow dense prehensions that find expres sion within the human context of culture and understanding as symbols of fractional and fragmented character. The density and obscurity of these symbols serve as the seedbed for the later fertilization of deepened awareness. The fruit of such fertilization is both a distinctness within the density of belief and a deepening of understanding of the prior ob scurities. The evolution of culture and history at each step in the histori cal process provides a new Sitz-im-Leben and a renewed understanding of the revelation.* Needless to say, while much of the work of theological elaboration is carried on at a conscious level, much is effected at an unconscious level as well. The process involves a basic selectivity that preserves cer tain elements of the tradition and allows other elements to fade into the obscurity of history. The selection and transmission were primarily oral in ancient cultures. This was certainly the case in the early patriarchal traditions, since it is not until the beginning of the first millennium that the tradition assumes a written form. The point has often been made that writing in antiquity served as a crutch for memory rather than a substi tute for it. The Greeks committed Homer to memory, and the Romans Virgil. The practice of memorizing traditional sources has always been very prominent in the East, and has been carried on even to very re cent times. The Talmud was not committed to writing until nearly the Middle Ages, the Koran was transmitted orally until well after Mo hammed's death. The Rig-veda, of course, was composed in the second millennium and transmitted by oral means alone until at least the fifth * It is important to note that the process of theological elaboration is distinct from that of faith, although in fact the former presupposes the latter. The problem of faith, however, does not concern us here. Theological elaboration pertains to a revelation accepted in and through faith. Faith, then, justifies it, but with or without faith, our psychological understanding of it should not change. Notes on Monotheism Origins 55</page><page sequence="14">century B.C. and may not have been actually put in writing until the fourth century A.D., when Sanskrit literature enjoyed a renaissance. Usually the style of the medium was poetic, again as a mnemonic aid. While the best part of such oral literature is poetry, there are also certain legal and liturgical codes that are in prose style. Legal corpora tend to take a formulary style, e.g., the Hebrew Book of the Covenant, the Ten Commandments, the Code of Hammurabi, the laws of Sumeria and Assyria, etc. It is probable that a period of prose transmission usu ally precedes the translation into verse. Despite its usually poetic form, oral tradition has a decidedly didactic character. This is es pecially true in legal and liturgical transmissions, but it is also a prominent feature in the singing or telling of poetical tales. Oral litera ture, as in the poems of Hesiod, the didactic poems of Mesopotamia, Aesop's fables, the parables of Jesus, or the rabbinical haggada, has a di rectly pedagogical intention. Thus superfluous elements tend to disap pear and only such elements are selectively retained that serve some positive pedagogical function, either in terms of vividness or emotional appeal, or in terms of intellectual understanding. There is no doubt that the oral tradition tends to carry along with it elements of folklore. Every noteworthy figure, king, warrior, or prophet, has an accretion of legends, often mythical, that collect around his figure. Frequently, the folkloristic accretions obscure the nucleus of historical truth. Fortunately, the data from comparative mythology, philological and linguistic analysis, and archeological investigation make it possible to determine the line dividing legend from history. The cir cumstances for establishing the historicity of the tradition in early Israel are quite good. The Israelite traditions belonged to an established nation with strong tribal, familial, and cultic ties that would demand validating oral documentation. Further, writing was known all through the patriarchal period and it is well known that the reliability of oral tradition in periods in which writing and written documents exercise their control over transmission is considerably greater than in situations in which the influence of writing was slight. Discovery of many in scriptions in the Phoenician alphabet found in Palestine, Syria, and Cyprus dating between 1200 and 900 B.C. indicates the currency of this script among the early Israelites. Other inscriptions suggest that the same alphabet was known in Palestine as early as 1700 B.C. In addition to proto-Canaanite script, the Accadian and Ugaritic cuneiform were 5 6 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="15">known to Palestinian sedentary Canaanites and nomads of the fifteenth century B.C. The transmission of the tradition into written form was an exceed ingly complex process that took many forms. It is apparent from study of the earliest written sources of Israelite religious traditions that they are essentially conservative. The tendency among ancient Oriental scribes was to compile rather than to eliminate divergent material in their various sources. The documents issuing from this approach, J and E, were additive rather than subtractive. They certainly show some significant divergences, but these differences reflect a maximum varia tion. Some of the more striking differences undoubtedly reflect di vergent traditions, both of which were incorporated, primarily into J and E respectively, and later into the compilation. As a result, the pro cess of oral transmission tends to be more consistent and logical than written transmission precisely insofar as it is constantly refining and sifting its material so that only that is included and transmitted which is consistent with the main body and ideology of the tradition. The influences that select and control the content of the tradition in the course of its evolution are indeed multiple and complex. We shall have occasion to return to their consideration more in detail elsewhere. Unquestionably, part of the process is carried on at unconscious levels. It would be entirely arbitrary to suggest that significant events are re pressed out of the evolving tradition in the absence of any supporting evidence and in the face of demonstrable tendencies in the opposite direction. At the same time, there is a demonstrable selectivity of the material of the tradition and a cathectic reinforcement of the content that serves as the object of belief. It is striking in surveying the history of Israelite traditions how frequently and consistently Yahweh is cast in the role of protector, guide, liberator, and father. He it is who does battle on behalf of Israel and protects her from the ravages of her enemies. Perhaps the most dominating themes of the religion of Israel center about the liberation from Egypt and the subsequent desert ex perience. It was the hand of Yahweh that freed Israel from bondage and miraculously guided and protected her through the wanderings of the desert years. These events dominated the consciousness of the Jew ish people and won their peculiar psychic force by reason of the intense resonance that they enjoyed with deep and in large part unconscious motivation. The complex of exodus events responded to very central Notes on Monotheism Origins 57</page><page sequence="16">needs in the soul of Israel. If we extrapolate the inner significance of the bondage and desert wanderings, they symbolize the ever-present threat, loss, deprivation, separation, abandonment. They stand for and call forth the most profound and powerful anxieties known to human existence. They stand at a thinly veiled remove from the Angst zum Tode. To think of these fundamental anxieties as forms of castration anxiety is at once insufficiently penetrating, overly reductive, and pre cariously theoretical. The classical analytic appraisal of castration anx iety probably is related to this level of human experience, but the experience itself transcends the conceptualization and calls for addi tional and more penetrating understanding. Beyond all doubt, Yahweh stands forth as the pre-eminent safe guard against such anxieties. In the desert, he guided and fed the peo ple. In the struggle for survival, he became the warrior god, the god of battles?the wars of Israel were the wars of Yahweh. Perhaps a decisive influence in the evolution of monotheism was the idea of a god who was not tied to one place, like the gods of Canaan, but who moved from place to place with the tribe in its nomadic wanderings. For the patri archs, god was attached to the people, he was "God of the Fathers" with whom a special covenant had been formed. He was thus different from the proliferation of pagan gods through which Israel moved at every stage of its existence. For the patriarchs the question of the existence of a single deity, beyond which there were no other gods, was not relevant. Even the more abstract and generalizing tendency of the Mosaic formulation and revelation of the name of Yahweh does not bring with it the full sense of an unequivocal monotheism. It is in the prophets really that the previously ambiguous monotheistic themes be come unconditional. Elias puts the power of the living god to the test against the impotence of the Ba'al (3 Kings 18). Amos proclaims Yahweh as the god of all nations (Amos 1:3-15) and Deutero-Isaiah proclaims the unity and the universality of the deity (Isaiah 41-45). In this evolution, it is important to recognize that the deepened realization of later theological reflection was able to return to earlier formulations and to find within their ambiguity elements that would carry the weight of more evolved concepts. In this manner, there evolved an inner consistency within the evolving patterns of realized belief. Thus, the evolution of the Israelite concept of monotheism reflects a multiplicity of influences stemming from the inner, unconscious needs 5 8 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="17">and anxieties of the people of Israel, from the complex aspects of their peculiar economic and social existence, from the determinants of that matrix of human concerns and values that constituted their unique culture, and from the patterns of historical interaction that swirled about them and served to underline the powerful forces at work in pre serving their unity and integrity as a nation from the cultural and military onslaughts of superior neighboring cultures. It has been our concern in this essay to explore the historical aspects of the evolution of monotheism. Our considerations thus far have raised important questions regarding the psychological forces at work in this evolution of a religious concept and further questions about the sociopsychological aspect that we have only touched on here. We must return to a fuller consideration of these issues later. But in terms of a historical perspective, I suggest that the religious awareness of Is rael went through a process of continuous evolution, reaching from the earliest recognizable strata of prehistory. The concept of pure mono theism was not self-conscious until the age of the prophets. The Mosaic revelation must be regarded as a significant point in this progression. It represents a significant discontinuity within continuity so frequently seen in human noetic evolution. In Teilhard's terms it represents a point of conjunction of complexification and convergence.13 The interesting point, of course, is the extent to which Moses him self was a contributor or determiner of this evolution toward a higher and more complexly sophisticated religious apperception. The question is difficult insofar as the later historical attribution of religious teaching to the figure of Moses was a literary device for expressing or asserting the religious authenticity of the teaching. It seems likely that a goodly portion of the so-called Mosaic doctrine is a later redaction of pre Mosaic Hebrew traditions attributed to Moses as a label of its accept ance as authentic tradition. At the same time there is no doubt that Moses brought with him a new insight and a new synthesis. The Mosaic synthesis was unquestionably an advance toward unequivocal mono theism on the level of formulation and on the level of thematic action. It is almost a secondary issue that the role of Yahweh in terms of theo logical awareness is not much different from that of the "God of the Fathers, 'El Shaddai." It is likely, indeed, that the influences of Egyptian monotheism are at work in some fashion. But it is also clear that the theology of Yahweh is not the theology of Aten. In addition, the Egyp Notes on Monotheism Origins 59</page><page sequence="18">tian influences were much more diversified than might have been an ticipated through the efforts even of a Moses. The evolution of the concept of the one and only god who created and ruled the universe was the product of a long and complex evolu tion. It stems from a process with multiple determinants. The significant determinants from a psychological perspective are those that derive from the intrapsychic aspects of individual belief in interaction with the societal forces that shape, control, determine, and influence the response of the individual to the demands of religious commitment. The process has both an intrapsychic and a sociocultural component that must be understood if the dynamic significance of the evolution of the Israelite religious tradition is to become meaningful. The inner workings of this process, it should be clear, are quite inde pendent of their religious or theological significance. Within the con text of belief, they represent the intervention of the divine action in human history and the revelation of divine wisdom in human thought. The story is the Heilsgeschichte, the record of Yahweh's saving pres ence among his people. Without the context of belief, they represent the most sublime reach of human experience and realization. With or without belief, they demand a profundity of understanding commensu rate with their sublime reality. REFERENCES i. Meissner, W. W., S.
