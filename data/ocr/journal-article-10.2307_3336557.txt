Hatumere, writes Labelle Prussin in her foreword, is a Fulbe term that derives from the Arabic term khatem, applicable to "a range of behavioral situations and contexts in North Africa," and has developed into "a generic reference to many aspects of self-conscious design in the West African environment." The book, which sets out to accomplish the im- mense task of surveying and theorizing about the role of Islam in the arts and architecture of I cn 1 eP u o s W~ o \o ao re C O Radiance from the Waters Ideals of Feminine Beauty in Mende Art Sylvia Ardyn Boone Sylvia Boone here provides a unique contribution to the study of African art-an eloquent account of the Sande Society of the Mende people of Sierra Leone and their ideals of feminine beauty.

Very familiar, indeed, to the Western reader in architecture is the division of this study into two parts: "Space" and "Time," described by the author as "synchronic and diachronic networks." Part I, viewed mainly as an attempt to relate a range of artifactual material to behavior pat- terns and conceptual imageries, begins with an introduction that leads to three chapters conveniently separated into "The Physical Environment," "The Behavioral Environ- ment," and "The Conceptual Environment." Part II, concentrating on the temporal change in architectural environments, includes four chapters, one of them laying emphasis on the urban centers of West African empires, and the three others, on the Islamized Mande-, Fulbe-, and Akan-speaking peoples. In its generality, the book gives a good, often informative overview of previous studies on West African artifacts as well as re- ligious and domestic built environments. Its merit lies in Prussin's skill to extract a few es- sential points from each study to complete her own, thereby weaving together diverse sources widely dispersed in the literature. Special praise should also be given to the au- thor for the compendious introduction that successfully maps out the state of scholarship in African studies as well as in architectural history with regard to Islamized West African architecture. Of great interest here is the in- clusion of numerous accounts of colonial travelers, and the stereotyping of the three European traditions of interpretation - the German, the British (or English-speaking), and the French, successively identified as the physically, the behaviorally, and the concep- tually determinist approach. Prussin's under- taking is to totalize all three elements in order "to paint a panoramic canvas rich in insights not only for Africa but for the world" (p. xxi). Her work accurately attesting to her theory, "The Behavioral Environment" stands out as the most enriching of the three chapters that follow the introduction. The relationship be- tween Islamic and West African designs is here established at the same time through ar- tifacts, through spatial awareness, through systems of reckoning time (calendars), and through other rituals. This yearning for "a panoramic canvas," that is to say, an unobstructed, complete view of the area concerned, this somehow uneven but totalizing undertaking, also presents a number of problems. Most puzzling for example is the way the text confidently nar- rows down its field of exploration and specu- lation. Of course, the author has carefully de- clared at the outset that her work is controver- sial and that errors are unavoidable. How- ever, does it suffice to insert one or two protec- tive statements in the text, then to go on in- dulging in definite assumptions while one is deeply aware of the shifting grounds on which one moves? Although the author did mention in passing the difficulty of delineat- ing what is "traditional," what is "pre- Islamic," and what Islam itself contributed 12</page><page sequence="2">during the millennium of its presence in West Africa, no attempt is made throughout the writing of the volume to acknowledge the existence of a much larger, more complex pic- ture than the one she limits herself to in deal- ing with the role of Islam in partially Islamic sub-Saharan Africa. If one takes the example of Spain, a country strongly marked by Islam, one cannot help but ask: Can a study of Is- lamic design in this country be carried out without any recognition of the cultures prior to Islam and without any attempt to cir- cumscribe some of the design features charac- teristic of Islam (while keeping in mind that Islam itself is not a monolithic culture)? I am not referring here to the author's parti pris (whether the influence of Islam has destroyed or enhanced traditional art forms and ways of living remains a widely debated question among African philosophers and thinkers), nor am I suggesting that there is a serious lack in her study, for how exhaustive can anyone be? The problem, rather, is built into the text itself: its inflexible voice of knowledge, its normative logic, and its extremely vague but reassuring statements, which scarcely take into consideration the potential of non- Islamic traditions in the examples chosen and never fail to reduce interpretations to a single reading. The overall experience of the book is that of a voice that is not really curious, questioning, or demanding in its explorations, but is eager to establish its authority. Devices to sustain this voice of knowledge and produce author- ity are numerous. The it-goes-without-saying creed is always lurking below such statements as: "Among the Berber populations the loom remains the ultimate symbol of magic protec- tion around which the entire range of cultural behaviors revolves" (p. 48); and "The tradi- tional literacy of the nomadic aristocracy in combination with matriliny and the promi- nent role of women in traditional Oualatan society unquestionably accounted for the early development of the architectural decor, but its subsequent relaxation reflected shifts in sex roles and skills that accompanied sedentarization and urbanization" (pp. 140- 141). The points made in these statements are certainly interesting. However, no substantial argument is closely made that would lead to such conclusions. The reader is expected to take for granted what is offered consistently not as explanations or suppositions but as statements offact with the assistance of superla- tives, generalizing adjectives, and conclusive adverbs. All doubts are suppressed, as little references here and there to other sources of authority suffice to supply the necessary alibi and exempt the author from accounting for the (interpretative) situation in a less reduc- tive, more critical way. (It is interesting here to compare Prussin's statement on the loom among the Berger with the analysis on the same subject by P. Bourdieu, to whom she re- fers the reader in a footnote. It is also worth noting that, in the second statement quoted, Prussin assumes the founders of Oualata were nomads; why such an assumption? Whether the first settlers in Oualata were rr . t~ 1:.?::1:: ^1: -:: -': '---'*:;i -"' - ':`~'-&amp;';: aV l i: J - -iii i-~~~~ii;-':, :?i - -.i::::;: -' ~-~- -~--~. ~ -A- *i:f' --,p*:---4 15</page><page sequence="3">. .

F , , 1 Soninke, in which case one should refer to the urban aspects of Koumbi Saleh, or whether they came from Baghdad, Iraq, as the elders of Oualata affirmed, they could very well have been urban peoples. The "telling evidence" quickly given to convince the reader of the nomadic heritage of Oualata [p. 138 1- the carved, wooden, forked-post calabash sup- ports- is most shaky: these are not only found in sedentary groups, such as the Bobo, the Joola, the Serer, the Asante [to mention just a few, although in the last three groups these supports are not carved] but they are also lo- cated in Oualatan houses at the entrances to spaces other than and adjacent to the senior conjugal chamber, including storage spaces. Furthermore, even if one agrees with Prussin that the prominent role of women accounted - still accounts - for the architectural decor, this situation is hardly peculiar to Oualata or to a nomadic tradition. The equating of seden- tarism with "male ownership builders" and transhumance with "female ownership buil- ders" [pp. 47-48] does not seem to take into consideration the prominent role of women in a number of sedentary societies in Africa as well as in other parts of the world.) To endorse the voice of authority, the author relies heavily on "evidences"; those that one could qualify as being above all "normative," for they do serve not to raise doubts but to prescribe norms. A few additional excerpts from Prussin's text exemplify this remark: (1) "She [the Fulbe woman], like the matframe tent she builds, is the essence of a 'moving center' and the rings encircling her head re- flect the importance attached to center in an ego-based world" (p. 82); (2) On Tombouctou: "In the older, more modest quarters, the sin- gle courtyard houses are a mathematically structured version of the ubiquitous West Af- rican compound" (p. 144); (3) Based on the an- thropomorphism of a few mosques: "Thus, these key monuments in the history of Islam in West Africa are at the same time a quintes- sential expression of an Islam now Af- ricanized" (p. 154); (4) "The spatial organiza- tion of individual compounds suggests an in- digenous prototype for the open, internal courtyard house found throughout West Af- rica. It also lays a spatial foundation for the adaptation of the prototypal North African courtyard house by West African popula- tions .... [Islam] inherited a number of ar- chitectural features, particularly the form of the Roman atrium, or courtyard house" (p. 105); (5) On Koumbi Saleh: "The total absence of any traditional internal courtyard suggests that these spaces were designed, not to ac- commodate family life or the presence of women in an Islamic context, but to display the wares of the intinerant merchants who came and went with the trans-Saharan cara- vans" (p. 113). Let me draw attention to a few immediate points in these five excerpts. The prescriptive and conclusive character of these statements is striking. The author resorts easily to the simplicity and definiteness of essences; here 17</page><page sequence="4">she goes so far as to encapsulate the tent- woman essence in an "ego-based world"! The Western notion of center suddenly takes on a universal meaning. In these sweeping generalizations there is a certain imperative to seal off that recalls the superfluous division of the text under the headings "Space" and "Time." (These headings lend a false air of se- curity regarding the direction and organiza- tion of the materials; they denote a desire for neat abstraction more than they serve a defi- nite analytical purpose. As the chapters themselves show, historical and environmen- tal sources inevitably overlap). If it is difficult to ascertain that none of the Islamic cultures has incorporated anthropomorphism, it is even more difficult to essentialize an Af- ricanized Islam! Impluvium houses (built around a circular or square courtyard) exist in the southern parts of Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Guinea, and Senegal. They may have existed well before the advent of Islam. To imply that their spatial organization "lays a spatial foun- dation for the adaptation of the prototypal North African courtyard house by West Afri- can populations" and to further assert that Islam inherited the Romanatrium is to indulge in another ill-founded evolutionist-type of generalization. Courtyard houses very similar to those found in Tunis have been excavated in Ur; they existed for 3,000 years in China and are built all along a latitude that extends from Morocco to Korea. Why then this fixa- tion on the Roman atrium? As for the imagina- tive assumption that internal courtyards are absent in Koumbi Saleh, hence the spaces were designed "to display the wares of the itinerant merchants," the least one can do is observe that no conclusion regarding the exis- tence of internal courtyards can be drawn when only a few buildings have been exca- vated there. On the one hand, a simple look at the one dwelling that remains visible in Koumbi Saleh allows one to recognize the similarity of its plan with those of presently existing Oualatan houses. On the other hand, a courtyard doesn't need to be "internal" (i.e., well enclosed by other built spaces) to ac- commodate family life and the presence of women in an Islamic context; the largely open courts of the Marka, the Tuculor, and the Soninke are just a few examples. The visual materials, which include draw- ings, photographs, and very few maps, are average in printing quality as well as in their selection. Only a few plans are new materials; most are oversimplified, which with the vir- tual absence of section drawings and interior photographs does not help the uninitiated reader. More maps could also have proved useful here, especially in the Manding chap- ter. In spite of its overall laboriously affected character, the study does provide valuable in- formation in a number of instances (the as- sociation between ancestral and mosque pil- lars; the acknowledgment of women's role in the arts and architecture; and even the brief analysis of the mason's role as grave-digger). The undertaking is certainly a difficult one that requires much persistence: one must agree with the choice of the last photograph of PT 32 E 57 STREET NEW YORK 10022 T.212.421.3688 LISA BRADLEY Director CARLO BELLA Asst.
