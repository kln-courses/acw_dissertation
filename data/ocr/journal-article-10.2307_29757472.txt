<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael Air am and Deborah E. Klimburg-Salter, eds., Coins, Art and Chronology. Essays on the Pre-Islamic History of the Indo-Iranian Borderlands, ?sterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Wien 1999, 498 pp. This book gathers together the papers presented by twenty-four researchers at the congress on 'Coins, Art and Chronology' held in Vienna in April 1996 in conjunction with the exhibition Weihrauch und Seide ? Alte Kulturen an der Seidenstrasse. The declared intention of the editors, Michael Alram and Deborah Klimburg Salter, has been precisely to combine different sensitivities and interests that, taken together, could define a general framework inside which to verify current hypotheses on the chronology of the area between Iran and India from the final centuries B.C. to the 9th cent. A.D. The importance of this 'multidisciplinary' approach, in which numismatics, archaeology and art history are combined is explained in the opening article by D. Klimburg-Salter, which also contains an introduction to the book. Within the overall framework of the disciplines involved the author deals with all the fundamental chronological problems related to the Kushan period, with special reference to the potential of art history and archaeology, which is still partly to be exploited. It is precisely from this focusing on the different issues in the various fields that emerges the need for integration in a common perspective of results in the individual disciplines. In the light of the discovery of the Rabatak inscription and of the conclusions J. Cribb (*) drew from it, in his paper M. Alram makes a general survey of all the numismatic documentation concerning the Indo-Parthians and the transition from these to the Kushans. He emphasizes the hypothetical nature of many of Cribb's arguments and provides an overview that perhaps makes the difficulties of interpretation easier to understand. In particular, the sequence of Indo-Parthian kings receives a different reconstruction: Hybouzanes, owing to his imitation of a coin of the Arsacid Pacorus struck in A.D. 92-95, is placed towards the end of the 1st cent. A.D. together with Sanabares, Sarpedonos, Abdagases II and Pacorus, who follow him down to the first-second quarter of the 2nd cent. A.D. Pacorus is then related to Vima I on the basis of a few overstrikes between the two. A different interpretation of the Chinese 575</page><page sequence="2">sources allows Alram to make a different evaluation also of the numismatic evidence, so that the indianizing coin iconographies of Vima Kadphises are probably the most obvious confirmation that the conquest of India is to be attributed to him and not to Vima Takto. Lastly, also the chronological implications of the dating of Kanishka are presented with all their related problems and the author, while not discrediting R. Gobi's hypothesis of the 3rd cent. A.D., nevertheless has no hesitation in clearly revealing its limits. P. Bernard, returns to the question of the location of the Indian Aornos which, in agreement with Tucci and rejecting the idea of Stein, he identifies as Mount Ham rather than as Pir Sar. In a thorough treatment of western textual sources and the archaeological evidence provided by the Taxila excavations, he demonstrates the literary nature of the citation of Aornos and of the description of Taxila in Filostratus' Life of Apollonias of Tyana, rejecting the historical reliability of the references to Apollonius' Indian journey. The article by O. Bopearachchi is focused on an examination of the coin hoards yielding Indo Greek coins between 1990 and 1994. The results seem to agree with the basic pattern of the succession of Indo-Greek kings already proposed by the author on previous occasions and which is based on the work of K. Jenkins (2). The description of the documentation and its implications for the chronology are preceded by a detailed examination of the various hypotheses concerning the origin of the so-called Old Saka Era. In the author's opinion, admitting that it was a Greek era, which is something that still remains to be proved, the most likely candidate is Menander: the importance traditionally attributed to him among the Indo-Greek kings is eloquently confirmed by the transmission on the coins of his Athena Alkidemos to practically all his successors, which seems to indicate that in this way they intended to link their name to that of the great king. Once the Indo-Greek chronology has been established with certainty, Bopearachchi, resuming his preceding works (3), analyses the series of Hermaeus imitations coined by the Yuezhi in the Paropamisus-Kabul area between A.D. 70, when they threw off the yoke of the Greek king, and the rise of Kujula Kadphises. The results of the stylistic and metrological analysis of eight groups of subsequent emissions allow comparisons to be made that yield a number of chronological terms. In particular, the drastic debasement of the fifth group is comparable to that of the Saka coinage during the final stage of the reign of Azes II, usually dated to the third decade of the 1st cent. A.D., that is, to the same years in which the Takht-i Bahi inscription situates the beginning of the reign of the Indo Parthian Gondophares. The occurrence of several Gondophares overstrikes on bronze coins of the seventh group of Hermaeus imitations (the last before the so-called Hermaeus-Kujula joint coinage) and of Kujula over Gondophares ultimately leads to the final overcoming of the Pahlava by Kujula being dated to around the mid first century. Kujula was then succeeded by the two Vimas and, in the 2nd cent. A.D., by Kanishka. R. Gobi, although absent from the congress for health reasons, has contributed to the volume with a revision of the last few works by J. Cribb on Kushan chronology. The Austrian scholar is particularly critical of Cribb with regard to the interpretation of the Chinese sources and to the equivalence between Qiu-jiu-que and Kujula Kadphises. Gobi's dating of Kanishka, in fact, agrees with the Chinese evidence only if Qiu-jiu que and Yen-gao-zhen are identified with the two Vimas, as the numismatic succession between them and between Kanishka and Vima II Kadphises is certain, as is the dating of Kujula of the 1st cent. A.D. By separating him from his immediate successors Kujula can thus be retained in the first century and Kanishka situated in the third. Basing his arguments on some earlier works, Gobi questions the reliability of Hou Han Shu, instead giving prominence to a mention of the Yuezhi contained in the Wei Lueh from which the idea of a Kushan kingdom at the height of its power in about the mid 3rd cent. A.D. could be drawn. This is all of course in addition to an examination of the numismatic evidence which, with its Roman and Sasanian associations, would suggest a chronological context situated in the third century. In addition to parallels between 576</page><page sequence="3">iconographic details, G?hl identifies the same mint engraver of a coin of the Kushanshah Ohrmazd and of one of Shapur II minted between A.D. 325 and 350. This enables him to set the beginning of the Kushanshahs at around 350 and therefore, given the coin links between these and the Later Kushans, having gone back in time over the approximately one hundred years during which his era is attested, to date Kanishka to the 3rd cent. A.D. In actual fact, this reconstruction leaves several aspects somewhat unclear: although the numismatic evidence may support Gobi's view of the facts, it is less univocal than he describes and also the set of historical elements with which he surrounds it arouses a number of doubts. In Gobi's scheme, the most difficult fact to account for becomes precisely the unquestionable one provided by the Kushan genealogy of the Ratabak inscription: if Kanishka reigned in the 3rd cent. A.D., as Alram says, 'Vima Takto and Vima Kadphises must have reigned together for over 130 years'. J. Cribb comes back to the question of the Kushan chronology he proposed and tries to refine some of its aspects. After making an analysis of Vima Takto coinage and of the connections between Kushan and Chinese, Khotanese, Indo Parthian, Sasanian and Gupta chronology, as well as those established by the coin sequences and inscriptions, the author goes on to examine the different eras attested in the inscriptions found in Kushan India. He thus identifies 'a pattern of era creation' on the basis of which to the succession of potentates in the Indian North-West at the beginning of our era, corresponds a set of different eras adopted by the various kings or their successors so that, to the Vikrama and Saka eras of 58 B.C. and A.D. 78, in addition to that of Kanishka, it is necessary to add a Maues era and a Gondophares one, while for te so-called Old Saka Era of the 3rd cent. B.C. he proposes a Kushan paternity. The latter element is particularly important as it can be related to a group of four inscriptions with very high dates that, according to Cribb, can be superimposed over the known 'chronological blocks' in order to set the date of the beginning of the Kanishka era between A.D. 107 and 120. This group consists of the inscriptions of Dasht-e Nawur (of 279) and Khalatse (redated as 284 instead of 184), and of two Mathuran inscriptions referring to the Great King and the King of Kings and thus ascribable to the Kushans, dated 270 and 299. Once it is considered that these dates must precede Kanishka, who presumably used his era (whom we know began in the third year of his reign) and may thus be attributed to the two Vimas, the approximately thirty years between the first (270) and the last (299) must be placed after what seems to be the latest known date of Kujula, namely the era of Azes 136 = A.D. 78 on the Taxila silver scroll. The comparison with the Kushano-Sasanian coinage, which would set the terminus ante quern at around A.D. 120, restricts the possibilities of year 1 of the Kanishka era to the period A.D. 107 (78 + 30) - 120. Cribb's approach to the general problem of the eras and of dating is interesting and innovative insofar as it actually seems to provide answers to a number of questions. However, the gaps in the evidence impose the greatest caution before accepting any hypothesis as being 'demonstrated by the facts'. E. Errington illustrates the results obtained so far by the British Museum Masson project aimed at identifying and cataloguing the materials ascribable to the British explorer and conserved by the India Office and the British Museum. Numerous cases are illustrated in which the scrutiny of Masson's writings, mainly housed at the India Office, allow a definite correspondence to be ascertained among the finds, most of which are conserved in the Departments of Coins and Medals and of Oriental Antiquities of the British Museum, and the original notes on their discovery. E. Zeymal demonstrates how the Tillya Tepe burials, in all likelihood belonging to a late Yuezhi environment in view of the terminus post quern imposed by a coin of Tiberius minted between 16 and 21 A.D., must be dated between the second and third quarter of the 1st century A.D. This represents a further argument against the old Kanishka dating of A.D. 78. N. Sims-Williams, starting from the hypothesis that the first year of the era attested in the Tochi Valley inscriptions is A.D. 233 and not 232 as proposed by H. Humbach and J. Harmatta, presents a survey of the dates found in a series 577</page><page sequence="4">of Bactrian documents found in recent years, all probably originating from the same area in northern Hindukush. These dates range from 157 - A.D. 389 to 549 - A.D. 781 (although the author includes in the discussion also the epigraphic evidence from Kara Tepe and Tochi, thus covering a time span from the year 35 to 636) in economic and legal texts. The detailed palaeographic illustration of the Bactrian characters, which essentially follow the corresponding Greek ones also in the use of numbers, is followed by an examination of the historical data yielded by these finds, from which several 'chronological blocks' emerge as well as the continuity of the dominion of the local nobles under the various rulers. Of importance to the Kushan chronological debate is the article by A. Nikitin on Kushano Sasanian coinage, from which it clearly emerges that a Kushanshah dating to the 4th century does not necessarily imply having to shift Kanishka to the 3rd century: a very rare drachm of the Sasanian Vahram I (273-276), bearing the inscription of the Balkh mint (BHLY), demonstrates simultaneously that the conquest of the Kushanshah had already taken place and that it was under the direct control of the King of Kings, leaving no space for a Sasanian King of the Kushans. From an examination of the full set of evidence, the author rules out the possibility of the titles of Kushanshah and King of Sakastan overlapping, thus invalidating Bivar's theory and chronology in which Ohrmizd, the King of Sakastan who rebelled against Vahram II, was identified with the Kushanshah Ohrmazd. The Kushanshahs would thus not begin before Hormizd II and then continued throughout the whole 4th century. The contributions of R. Gyselen, P. Callieri and J. Lerner are dedicated to seals. While Gyselen's short article describes some Sasanian seals bearing images of Greco-Roman deities in order to illustrate the iconographic exchange that took place between the Greco-Roman world and Sasanian Iran, Lerner presents a group of seals selected from the Rosen Collection of New York which show the persistence in the Bactrian area, between the Kushan and the Hephthalite periods, of western influences that ultimately merge with the local artistic currents. The direct model of Ardokhsho with the purnaghata should thus be sought not so much in Tyche/Fortuna as in the personification of the Roman Annona depicted on imperial coins with the modius, which is seen as the key to the identification of a definite iconographic link. Callieri on the other hand is concerned with some Huna seals. In an accurate stylistic-iconographic analysis, he proposes a subdivision into four classes that succeed each other chronologically from the Kidarites to the 'Hephtalite' period. The gradual movement away from the Sasanian canons, the comparison with the Kidarite and Hephtalite coinage, as well as the presence of a few inscriptions, represent the principal evaluation criteria by means of which the following chronology may be established: the first two classes, both ascribable to a 'Kidarite' environment, are dated to the late 4th-early 5th cent. A.D.; the third represents a transition and the last one, now fully Hephtalite, is dated to the period between the second half of the 5 th and the end of the 6th century A.D. V. Sarkosh Curtis illustrates a few results of a study on the coinage of the Sasanian kings Peroz and Kavad within the framework of a broader project to reappraise the entire Sasanian coin production undertaken by the Cabinet of Coins and Medals of the British Museum in 1992. Using the dates appearing on the reverse sides, the three types of crown used by Peroz on his coins can thus be linked to specific political events: the first was used during the two-year period A.D. 457-459, until the definitive defeat of Hormizd III, the second was replaced by the third on the king's return from captivity among the Hephthalites in 467. Examination of the legends also reveals that Peroz is depicted on the coins as bearing the title not only of Kay but also that of MLK' (MLKA(N)). Kavad coinage on the other hand displays an interesting, but yet unexplained detail at the time of the changes on the crown, that is during the thirteenth year of the reign, also the execution of the characteristic diadem ties undergoes a change that lasts until the nineteenth year. P.O. Harper analyses the iconographic programme of Taq-e Bostan, claiming that it belongs to a northern artistic tradition that differs from the southern one of Fars and that can actually be traced back to Near Eastern art. The central theme of the Taq-e Bostan representations must in fact be interpreted in the light of the 578</page><page sequence="5">Mesopotamian regal symbolism and actually corresponds to the exaltation of the king's figure in all the functions connected with his role. In this sense, also the geographic location of the site half way between the Mesopotamian and the Iranian worlds is significant. F. Thierry examines the Turgesh coinage, completely reappraising its classification. On the basis of reverse side typology, two groups are thus defined, both of which further subdivided into three classes. In the first group the reverse is characterized by the presence of a tamgha (which changes in class three), and in the second by variants of an inscription, each mentioning a different king. Also the tamghas appearing on the reverse sides of the second group again suggest a three-way subdivision: we find three symbols, all based on a basic trident-shaped element. For these, as for the two types of tamgha from the first group, the author rejects the current hypothesis of a Chinese origin and instead emphasizes the connections, kept alive above all through Sogdian mediation, with the Iranian-Central Asian world. Metrological analysis suggests possible criteria for attributing these coins. Those of the second class, the largest and spread even outside the Turgesh area itself, are related to the most famous of the Turgesh qaghan, Sulu (A.D. 716-737), while the following types, of inferior quality, are attributed to various later qaghan, the identity of which it is attempted to establish by means of a thorough examination of the Chinese sources. H. Tsuchiya, while summing up the results of field explorations carried out between 1991 and 1996 by a team of Japanese researchers to discover the route followed by Fa-hsien between Pamir and Swat, after a detailed geographic prospectus of the area of northern Pakistan, reaches the conclusion that the Chinese pilgrim followed the Pamir Khora Burt Pass-Karambar-Ishkoman route to reach Darel and from there Swat, rather than the route across the passes of Boroghil and Darkot and along the Yasin valley, so far considered the more probable. The reappraisal by Sh. Kuwayama of the Tapa Sardar chronology gives M. Taddei an opportunity to make some considerations concerning the way to approach chronological problems. With the sensitivity and depth of analysis that distinguished him Taddei shows how, in view of the incompleteness of the documentation, the conclusions reached by researchers often lack that objectivity which, almost implicitly, are attributed to them. In this sense the chronological sequence of Tapa Sardar is a clear example of how what seems probable need not necessarily be certain: if the Late Period based on the coins is certainly later than the 5th century A.D., it does not mean that the sculpture production of this period, given the analogies with that of Fondukistan, can be unquestionably dated to the 7-8th century, as there is actually no reason why the sculptures of the Late Period of Tapa Sardar should not precede thosev of Fondukistan. The problem ? and here the case of the relationship between Gandharan art and the unbaked clay sculpture production of Afghanistan is a shining example ? thus becomes to avoid superimposing different planes and attributing a chronological value to specific characteristics instead due to cultural environments that, although similar in many respect, are nevertheless different. F. Tissot illustrates some examples of jewellery reproduced in Gandharan art. Drawing parallels with similar jewellery from the Sarmatian world, she dwells at length on the saltire, or single or multiple row necklaces with a central gemstone between two animal figures facing each other, as well as on the carcanet, or flat necklaces enveloping the neck which, on two specimens of bodhisattva (in the Matsuoka and Royal Ontario Museums of Tokyo and Toronto) are also decorated with anthropomorphic figures. T.I. Zeymal, in her article, comes back to a summary of the chronology of the Buddhist complex of Kara-Tepe. The discovery of structure Z in the mid '80 led to a revision of the site chronology, which was recalculated on the basis of two periods of activity. The first corresponds to the full Kushan era and ends with the Sasanian conquest. The numerous graves belong to the following period of desolation, which the finds of coins used as 'obols of Charon' allow to be dated to the years spanning the second half of the 4th century to the middle of the 5th. Then begins the second phase of the site's life, that lasts until the end of the first half of the 6th century and is probably connected with the presence of Turkish rulers in the area. The final period, from the late 6th until well into the 7th century, is again one of desolation, when the site was for the 579</page><page sequence="6">second time used for burials. Ch. Haesner, through a detailed exam of the so-called Mohammed Nari stele of the Lahore Museum, as well as of another one conserved in the Peshawar Museum, identifies the source of the representations of Paradise in the Buddhist art of Dunhuang and Turfan in the Gandharan portrayals of Paradise associated with the worship of Amitabha, which existed in India as early as the 2nd cent. A.D. V. Raspopova describes eight coins and coin? like bracteates of Byzantine style found during the excavations of Piandjikent (and the small number of similar finds in the rest of the Sogdian world). They are all copies of imitations of originals issued between A.D. 408 and 629. E. Lubo-Lesnichenko examines a series of figurative motifs typical of carpet manufacture in the China of the Six Dynasties period (A.D. 222-589) and of the early Tangs. These consist of decorative elements of western origin, many of which Iranian, adopted and often reworked according to the Chinese taste. The examination of the finds, in particular those made in the '70s in the Turfan area, allows a chronological sequence to be worked out for the use of these motifs. A comparison with known models of glass vessels in the Islamic area allows J. Kr?ger to ascertain the probable areas of production of the vases found in a Buddhist crypt beneath the Famen temple at Changan. The date of closing of the crypt, A.D. 874, provides a terminus ante quern in the early Islamic era, while the specific character? istics of the vases are reminiscent of the typologies of the various areas of the Islamized Middle East along the Silk Road: Siria, Iraq and Iran.
