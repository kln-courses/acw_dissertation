The aim of the excavations and of the present survey is the study of human evolution and of past man-environment relationships. The immediate purpose of this preliminary sur- vey, therefore, was to lay foundations for future studies of cultural adaptation to past environmental pressures in this part of northwestern Iran during a crucial interval in the evolution of Early Man. The area encompassed by the survey lies within the triangle formed by the three cities of Tabriz, Maragheh and Mianeh, and was concentrated on the terraces of the Rud-e-Shur, the Murdu-Chai and the Shahr-e Chai rivers and their tributaries, which drain the Kuh-i Sahand massif to the northeast of the fossil sites. The area surveyed represents the southeastern margin of a Tertiary Lake which was marked by several complete advances and recessions. Our survey was conceived of as a reconnaissance expedition, and we have left systematic surveying and the sounding of the loci that were registered for another occasion. Those artifacts that were collected were restricted to a minimum number of diagnostic pieces from each locus. With the exception of one small flake and a blade, both single occurrences, no Middle or Upper Paleolithic industries or sites were found in the area. Three cave sites and seven open air localities with Lower Paleolithic artifacts were registered by the survey, and of these three, MMTT-GI (P1. IIIb), MMTT-MI and MMTT-HI/H4 (P1. IIIc), were located on terraces above the cave sites. The stream erosion which is responsible for the formation of these terraces began cutting the present topography as soon as uplift of the mountains had taken place and is a process which is continuing to the present. Open air sites consisted of limited accumulations of primitive tool-kits including side and end chop- pers, unifacially retouched flakes as well as bifacially flaked cores. One biface was recovered from site MMTT-HI which, however, lacks the evolved soft-hammer technique of later Acheulean handaxes recovered in the valleys of the Zagros mountains in the neighbouring province of Kermanshah. Raw materials employed for the manufacture of artifacts varied between flints, chalcedonies and rocks of hydrothermal origin and are nearly all heavily patinated or heavily rolled. The cutting edges obtained show evidence of use as choppers, punches, scrapers and knives. The loci registered are theoretically the remnants of places where animals were killed or places where hominids may have camped for shorter or longer periods of time, when climatic conditions favoured open air settlements, and their distribution pattern suggests that this Northwestern province of Iran was intensively and continuously inhabited during both Late Lower Pleistocene and Middle Pleistocene times. HIND SADEK-KOOROS Bastam Die Grabungen in Bastam wurden in der Zeit vom I0. Juli bis zum 15. September I975 in der sechsten Kampagne weitergeftihrt (siehe Iran VI (1968), 166; VII (1969), 188; VIII (1970), 176-78; IX (I97I), 165-68; XI (I973), 185-88; XII (I974), 205-07; XIII (I975), 174-76).</page><page sequence="3">SURVEY OF EXCAVATIONS 155 Es wurde an I I Stellen die Arbeit derVorjahre weitergefiihrt oder neue Fldichengrabungen begonnen: I. Die Hallenbauten westlich oberhalb des Siidtores wurden abschliessend freigelegt, desgleichen die Rampe des Weges vor dem Suidtor. Die Abfolge der Rdiume im Bereich des Siidtores ist nunmehr geklart. Saimtliche Gebaude geharen dem 7. Jahrh. v. Chr. an. 2. Der Aufweg vom Sudtor auf den Burgberg konnte topographisch festgelegt und das grosse Gebiude, das den Aufweg auf seiner Westseite flankiert, konnte an Hand der oberflichlich sichtbaren Reste vermessen werden; es ist im 7. Jahrh. v. Chr. entstanden. 3. In der 6stlichen Vorburg wurde eine Flichengrabung im Bereich der terrassenfirmig am Hang gestaffelten urartaischen Gebaiude begonnen, die die topographische Kenntnis der Bastamer Burg stark bereicherte. Die Gebaude sind im 7. Jahrh. v. Chr. errichtet worden. 4. Im Bereich der Mittelburg wurde ein weiterer Abschnitt der Burgmauer des 7. Jahrh. v. Chr. untersucht. 5. Die Grabung im Bereich des Tores zwischen der Mittel- und der Oberburg wurde bis zur Ver- teidigungsmauer hinabgefiihrt. In einem Raum neben dem Tor wurden 83 Tonbullae gefunden, die dort archiviert waren. Sie standen in Zusammenhang mit grossen Mengen von Tierknochen und scheinen als Belege zu Fleischlieferungen ffir die Bastamer Burg gehart zu haben. Die Mehr- zahl der Tonbullae traigt Abdrucke von Stempelsiegeln, einige Tonbullae haben keine Abdrucke erbracht, einige Bullae Stempelabdrucke und Abrollungen eines stets wiederkehrenden Roll- siegels, des K6nigs ? und einer Gottheit ? und einer Inschrift tiber dem Bild, die angibt, dass es sich um das " Siegel des Rusa " handele. Tonbullae mit entsprechenden Siegel-Abrollungen sind von Toprakkale her bekannt (C. F. Lehmann-Haupt, Armenien Einst und Jetzt I (I9IO), 222). 6. Im Innern der Oberburg konnte die Grabungsfliche auf dem Gipfelplateau mit dem Schnitt von 1973/74 vereinigt werden und damit ein Schnitt durch die Oberburg gewonnen werden, der fiir die Rekonstruktion der H6henentwicklung der terrassen-f6rmig angelegten urartatischen Bauten des 7. Jahrh. v. Chr. im Bereich der Oberburg wichtig ist. 7. Die Grabungsfltiche im Hallenbau am Nordtor konnte erheblich erweitert und der Haupteingang in das Gebiaude sowie mehrere Raume freigelegt werden. Der Hallenbau, das auf Grund der Keramikfunde ilteste urartaische Gebaude in Bastam (8. Jahrh. v. Chr.) wurde weitgehend un- verandert im 7. Jahrh. v. Chr. weiterbenutzt und ebenso in nachurartlaischer, medischer Zeit, wie Funde von Keramik aus dem 6. Jahrh. v. Chr. in den Annexen des Hallenbaus zeigen. Eine lockere parthische Besiedlung iiberzieht das Gebiet des Hallenbaus. 8. Die Hangbebauung aus dem 7. Jahrh. v. Chr. nordwestlich des Nordtores konnte weiter topo- graphisch geklairt werden und die Innenseite des Nordtores von Schutt befreit werden. 9. Das Haus in der Siedlung wurde in erweiterter Grabungsfliche untersucht. Nunmehr zeichnen sich drei verschiedene, teilweise aneinandergebaute urarthaische Hauser des 7. Jahrh. v. Chr., jeweils mit Umbauphasen voneinander ab. Auch hier wurden Tonbullae, sogar mit Keilschrift- Text, gefunden. io. Die bisher " Risalitmauer " genannte Anlage im Tal gegentiber dem Bastamer Burgberg, jetzt als Ostbau bezeichnet, erbrachte neben dem Tor an ihrer Westseite Raume mit urartaischer Keramik, die den Bau eindeutig ins 7. Jahrh. v. Chr. datieren. In der Siidlichen Ecke des Ostbaus ist ein dreischiffiges Hallengebtiude angegraben worden, das im Plan dem Hallenbau am Nordtor in 2. Bauphase und dem Hallenbau oberhalb (westlich) des Siidtores entspricht. Die Funktion des Ostbaus bleibt noch immer unklar. i 1. Die Ruine auf den Hdhenziigen 6stlich gegenfiber dem Burgberg wurde untersucht und ergab ein mittelalterliches Grab mit einer der Richtungs- und Bestattungsart (im Holzsarg) wegen sehr wahrscheinlich armenischen Einzelbestattung. Im Rahmen der Bastam-Grabung wurden von Bastam aus drei urarttaische Burgen vermessen. Es handelt sich um die Burg bei Sufian, zwischen Ushnuiyeh und Yaldyan, die im 8. Jahrh. v. Chr. ent- stand und weitgehende Qbereinstimmung mit der urartaischen Festungsmauer von Hasanlu zeigt. Ferner um Qaleh Haidari bei Siah Chechme. Im Bereich dieser Burg liegt der einzige bisher in Iran bekannt gewordene urartaische Treppentunnel, der gleichfalls vermessen wurde.</page><page sequence="4">156 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES ,- - I I ' 1. .

WOLFRAM KLEISS Haftavan Tepe The fifth season of excavations, of necessity briefer than previous seasons, resulted in the addition of two further phases to the cultural sequence already established, even though a sondage to virgin soil, through levels preceding Period VIII, remains an objective for future years. Immediately following the excavations came two weeks devoted to conservation of the building remains. Two phases in the life of the round house discovered in TT 9 were now distinguished; and it was found to have been preceded by an earlier, more massive round building, divided into four quadrants by internal partitions. The absence of any door and the parallel with a similarly designed structure at Yanik Tepe suggest that this may have been a silo, though this cannot be proved. Nakhichevan lugs, dimples and other Early Trans-Caucasian elements show that Period VIII was the direct precursor of Period VII, in which little work was done this season. On the summit of the mound in Area C 2 was found a scatter of stones overlying the Period VII building level, and probably attributable to some important structure, now completely ruined, its foundations mostly robbed out, this robbing being followed by storage pits. Associated with these layers was a distinctive painted pottery, with geometric designs in black or dark brown on a pale orange or cream ground: this is easily recognizable as distinct from the burnished and painted ware of Haftavan VIB, two sherds of which were for the first time found on the citadel. This matt, dark-on-light pottery may well have affinities with the Giyan-Godin III region, suggesting intrusion of a southern group, an additional reason for terming this Haftavan VIC. This was a brief phase, but it marked the end of the long domination of the Early Trans-Caucasian culture: some connections with the " Painted Orange Ware " of Hasanlu VII seem possible for Haftavan VIC. The layer of silt between the levels of Haftavan VII and VIB on the west side of the mound could indicate desertion of the lower parts of the site at this time. The more excavations are carried out in levels of Haftavan VIB, the longer the period seems likely to have lasted. In Area Y I the excavations begun in 1971 have been brought to a satisfactory conclu- sion, though there is some reason to doubt if the first occupation of Period VIB has been exposed. Eight phases were distinguished, covering the lifetime of three main buildings grouped round a courtyard: the massiveness of these buildings suggests an upper storey. In the fifth phase the screen wall joining the west and south buildings was breached to make the entrance up into the courtyard of Area Y 2, found in 1973. The west building was found in part standing over three metres high, while the east building is incompletely preserved, one section being robbed out to the foundations. In Y 2 a columned structure was excavated, with two rows of slender columns of wood, marked by post-holes carefully packed round with stones. The flimsiness of this building, in contrast with the scale of those in Y I, makes any claim that this is the earliest columned hall in western Iran rather over-bold. Drastic changes came about in the penultimate of the eight phases distinguished in Y i, with the collapse of the west wall of the east building. It was then that the battered wall, first found in 1971, was built across the south building. To this phase belongs a large storage jar with incised motif below the rim, perhaps represent- ing an ear of corn. The later stratum of Period VIB, distinguished previously in Y 2/3, X-X 2 and ZX, was reached in a new extension (BB) north of Y I-Y 2, as well as in another new area, ZXR 3, part of a trench designed ultimately to connect ZX and R.</page><page sequence="6">158 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Concentration of effort on the east side of the site and on the citadel resulted in the absence of any excavations in Period V levels. Period IV was represented by a burial group from Y 3. The Urartian period (Haftavan III) was reached only in a new extension on the citadel (TX I). New discoveries attributable to the Achaemenian period (Haftavan II) were made in Y 3 and in ZXR I, next to the lower end of R. A large defensive ditch had been encountered on the west side of the mound (E) in the 1968 season, and had been tentatively dated to Period II. This was again traced in Y 3, where a secondary phase was distinguished: the silt fill of the ditch was re-cut. In the uppermost fill of the ditch was a burial. This, with another one next to ZXR I, is attributable to the Parthian period, probably about the third century B.c.: an incised red-warejug, a bronze hairpin and a carnelian finger-ring provide the principal evidence. Thus another phase is added to the long history of the site, if only in the form of burials, including some found on the citadel in 1968-69. In ZXR I a brick wall was found to be related to the same ditch, though set back from its inside ledge. Here may be a lower defensive perimeter, running round the foot of the citadel. Sasanian occupation has been found outside the citadel, for the first time, in ZXR I, where it over- lies the surface contemporary with the Period II ditch and wall, providing additional dating evidence for the ditch. A pottery lamp is of a type found in Sasanian context at Takht-i Suleiman; and a deco- rated comb of ivory is paralleled by one previously found at Haftavan. Bricks of similar size were used in Periods I and II; but it is worth remarking that the same size has also been found in Haftavan VIB. Conservation work was concentrated on the Period II tower and on the Y i remains of Period VIB, with some work also on the Urartian citadel. CHARLES BURNEY Kordlar Tepe Some questions concerning the stratigraphical, typological and structural situation of the Early Iron Age were answered during the third campaign of the Austrian Expedition on Kordlar Tepe in 1974. Now it seems sure, that the site was at least four times inhabited and each of these settlements was destroyed by fire. The excavation so far was concentrated on an area slightly East of the highest point of the Tepe where Io trenches (Io x Io metres) have been opened. The specimens found in level I could be clearly distinguished from those found in level IV. This, however, was not possible in the case of level II and III since it was difficult to assign the specimens to one of the two periods. In the lowest level IV it was possible to make out two large building complexes. In the northern part the ground plan of an imposing brick building with foundations of hewn stones became visible. Not all details of this structure are clear, because the baulks have not yet been removed. The building had a big central hall: adjacent to this hall in the East and West were square and rectangular rooms. On the North-East and in the South-West these rooms are projecting a bit over the general outline of the building (P1. Ia). The main entrance must have existed in the South-East. There are two thick walls running parallel for a few metres, then they turn to the North into the interior of the building thus forming an angular doorway. It is impossible to reconstruct the size of the gate, because a part of the walls is missing as it was torn down later. In the northern corner of the entrance was found a big hingestone in situ and a little further back many pieces of several Pithoi vessels. In the central hall there were clay benches along the southern and western walls. There was another bench of two rows of bricks along the southern face of the building where there must have been a small court. A different and modest building made ofpis6 on rude stone foundations was excavated in the South. Only some of this building has been uncovered so far. In one of the rooms there was a large platform made of clay for baking bread and in another room a pear-shaped storage pit. There were also grinding stones and coarse pottery. Everything in this building gives an impression of daily life and work. In both buildings the traces of a great fire could be recognized fairly well. In the second building level, in period III, the brick building was re-erected and additionally enlarged by some new walls. The small court in the South was closed by a broad wall made of mud bricks. Two parallel brick walls with pressed mud in between were put into the space in front of the</page><page sequence="7">Pl. Ia. Kordlar Tepe" south-west chamber with small court in front of it. Pl. Ib.

It possibly represented a sort of ascent to an entrance higher up. In the North-West and in the South this wall projects in the form of towers. The building seems therefore strongly fortified. In the South- East there was a narrow passage with a stone sill in the enclosure wall. From there it was possible to reach directly the wall-bridge in front of the inner gate. After some time in the South a square room was attached to the outer side of the enclosure wall. It has a small entrance on the opposite side and nearby there is an arched oven. Just in front of this room was a bin which was probably used for storage. In the burning debris between the building and the enclosure wall we found the twisted skeleton of a young man who must have perished in the fire following period III. According to a radiocarbon dating of a burned timber nearby, the fire must have taken place in IoIo o ? 80 B.c. (VRI-446, Institut fir Radiumforschung in Vienna). The next building level, that is period II, is clearly characterized by a gigantic wall made of pise. It is almost three metres wide and runs from South to North. It begins with a bastionlike projection in the South-East and from there it turns to the North. Near this turning point there is a little gate. The foundations consist of two rows of heavy stone slabs (P1. Ib). The wall was built immediately on the exterior walls of the old brick building, and can probably be regarded as an inner town wall. A little later the brick building was rebuilt and formed a massive, nearly square citadel, 27-28 metres wide. It was attached to the town wall. The walls were made of pis6, strengthened by a facing of bricks. The foundations were c. 7 metres wide, so only four rooms in the interior of the building were still used. The fortification wall may have included rooms and passages as it is remarkably broad. Building level II is covered by a considerable burning layer. It was not possible to obtain a coherent picture of the building sites of the top level I because of weathering. It is, however, certain that this settlement has no structural connections with the buildings and walls of level II, III and IV. The Tepe was reinhabited therefore probably only after a time. Some stone foundations from large buildings were found and traces of some small, primitive huts with mud walls. Periods II and III form a typological sequence with Period IV and show a greater variety of forms though the fine pottery is less elaborate. A characteristic type of pottery is a small goblet with a small handle and a grey polished surface. Three zoomorphically shaped baking covers made of clay were found similar to those excavated in 1973. The ceramics and other objects in the period I settlement present a fundamentally new concept. Above all the tendency of the pottery towards figures or solid samples cannot be denied. Among these decorations bosses on vessels with two handles stand out which are reminiscent of similar pots in the South Russian areas during Early Scythian times. An interesting object in this level is a large urn with an intentionally broken rectangular window on its upper part. Quite similar grave urns with symbolic openings for the soul (Seelenl6cher) appear in Middle and Eastern Europe in the beginning of the first millennium B.C. Important results about keeping domestic animals in the Iron Age at Kordlar were gained by studying the animal bones. This was carried out by a team of zoologists from the Vienna Natural History Museum. 4,600 bones were examined. (A report is published in the " Mitteilungen der Anthro- pologischen Gesellschaft in Wien ", 1975/76.) The figures of the percental share of the different animal species were on one hand gained from the minimal rate of individuals and from the number of assigned animal bones on the other hand. Thus the figures are as folllowing: More than 50% sheep about 20% cattle about Io% goat about 8% dog less than 5% horse. The percental share of pig and donkey is less than 2% each. Game is represented only by 2%, but there are altogether 18 species being hunted in the Iron Age. Among them are boar, gazelle, bos primigenius, wolf, fox, hare, flamingo, wild goose, wild duck, eagle, quail, dove and crow. ANDREAS LIPPERT 12</page><page sequence="11">160 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES The Mahidasht Project The Mahidasht Project of the Royal Ontario Museum conducted an initial season of archaeological survey from mid-May until the end of August, 1974. The research was carried out with a grant from the Canadian Council, with supplementary funds from the Royal Ontario Museum. A staff, averaging 14 people, was drawn from Canada, Iran, the United States, and England. The area outlined in the original survey scheme covered approximately 4,000 square kilometres of valley and mountain in Kermanshah province, and can be roughly described as the drainages of the Abi-Marik, the Qara Su and its tributaries, the lower Razavar and the lower Gamas Ab. During the course of the survey, which was conducted by vehicle and with the help of aerial photographs, some 1,700 square kilometers, or approximately 40% of the area, was intensively surveyed. A total of 550 sites were located. The early parts of the cultural and ceramic sequence in this area had been established in broad out- line by Braidwood, et al. in 1959-60o (Iranica Antiqua I, pp. 3-7). The earliest ceramic assemblage seems to be that associated with Tepe Sarab, which is in turn associated with materials known from Jarmo. Other early ceramics were also found, but their relative position vis-a-vis one another is unknown. One distinctive variety was a soft, chaff tempered ware with a dark brown to black slip on the outside, painted in simple linear motifs in a pale pink or white paint. Open vessels of this variety have a burnished red slip on the inside of the vessel. The ware is unknown from other areas, but would seem to fit into the neolithic range of ceramics. Very few sites were discovered which belong to the neolithic horizon. Among the tentative explana- tions of this phenomenon that can be advanced at present are that the population density was consider- ably lower than in later periods, that the period of occupation at any given site was of short duration, making it difficult to locate, or that the sites have been masked by later geological deposits. It is also possible that a combination of these factors is responsible for the current situation. On the last men- tioned factor, see below. The first widespread ceramic horizon is generically related to the Ubaid painted wares of Mesopo- tamia, Khuzistan and the Western Iranian plateau, but differs in many details. Indeed, it would appear that more than one "Ubaid" ware is represented in the Mahidasht survey area, but the extent to which these differ chronologically as well as stylistically is as yet uncertain. The plain wares associated with the " Ubaid " painted wares are the soft, chaff tempered, red slipped ones known from Seh Gabi and Godin. On some " Ubaid " sites, Dalma impressed wares occur, but Dalma painted wares are absent from the assemblage. Finally, another painted ware, unrelated to the Ubaid tradition, is found on some " Ubaid " sites. It is hard, well fired, with little or no temper (grit when it occurs), and the sur- face is sometimes covered with a red to black slip or wash. Paint colour varies from black to red to white, and the designs are all linear. This ware is probably similar to that reported by Goff, who assigns it to the " Uruk " period (Iran IX, p. 139 ff-). Neither the Godin VII nor Godin VI assemblages are represented in the Mahidasht. A few sherds characteristic of the former were found, but not as part of the total Godin VII assemblage. Of particular note is the virtually complete absence of painted wares in the late Sialk III, Godin VI and Giyan IVd style. All of this points to the fact that the Uruk horizon follows immediately upon the " Ubaid " in the Mahidasht. Bevel rim bowls, " Blumentapfe ", and other wares and forms distinctive of the lowland Uruk sites are found, but in connection with locally produced wares. One has the impression that the number of sites declines from the Ubaid to the Uruk period, but that the sites themselves are larger. It is interesting that the sequence here is closer to that known from Luristan than to that revealed at Godin and Seh Gabi. This is a phenomenon that will appear yet again at the end of the Uruk period. The next ceramic horizon that we were able to identify in our survey was the painted wares of the late third and early second millennia. During the course of the survey, we did not find a single sherd that could unequivocally be identified as Early Bronze Age Grey Ware. Thus it would appear that Susa D material follows on the Uruk, as is the case at Baba Jan and in Luristan, rather than the se- quence known from Godin and Tepe Giyan. Pottery in the Susa D-Giyan III/IV painted style is widespread in the Mahidasht, and the occupation of sites seems to have been both long and intensive. We have not yet been able to subdivide the period on the basis of the material in hand.</page><page sequence="12">SURVEY OF EXCAVATIONS 161 The Iron I and Iron II occupations in the valley are unrecognized. Few of the characteristic grey wares associated with this period to the east and north were found in the course of the survey, and those few that did occur were sometimes associated with burials. The Luristan painted wares of this period known from Baba Jan were also largely absent. Thus, the end of the second and beginning of the first millennia are either a period of significant contraction in settled population, or they are masked by our ignorance of the local ceramics. It should be noted that the former is the case in the Kangavar valley. With the Iron III period, the settlement pattern is once again both obvious and widespread. Buff wares whose shapes are known from Godin, Baba Jan and Nush-i Jan are well represented, although they are usually in a chaff tempered ware that is not as well made as the samples known from excavation. The Iron III sites are often large, and on a number of them imports from Assyria, such as the Late Assyrian beaker, were found. The succeeding Iron IV period (see Young, Iran XIII, (1975), P I192) appears to be a continuation of the Iron III period in the valley, with many of the same sites continuing to be occupied. The pottery seems to continue many of the forms of the preceding period, with the introduction of " Achaemenid " forms as well. Many of the sites exhibited both painted Triangle Ware and painted Festoon Ware, suggesting that the two may be contemporary rather than one being derivative from the other. It is still too early to assess the later periods, although the valley seems to have been intensively settled in the Parthian, Sasanian and Saljuq periods. Other periods are more difficult to define at this time. Finally, it is important to note that both an initial geomorphological survey and a survey of present land use patterns were carried out, the former by Professor Ian Brookes, the later by Mr. Robin Dennell, who also worked with Brookes on the geomorphology. A number of sections along the Ab-i Marik indicate a long period of stability in the region from the Early Holocene through the Parthian period. At some time starting in the Parthian to Early Islamic range, massive erosion took place on the surround- ing mountain fans, depositing first a layer of poorly sorted gravels which included much sherdage, bone and fresh water shell, and then a thick layer of fine alluvium that in some places reaches a depth of two metres. This thick alluvium of recent data has important implications for the recovery of early sites. The land use survey was related to the settlement pattern in a preliminary fashion by Dennell. He reports a close association between settlement, first class arable land, and good water sources such as springs and perennial streams. Such is not surprising, given the assumed dependence on cereal cultiva- tion as the basis for the economy of the region over the last 7,000ooo+ years. More significant, perhaps, is the virtual lack of sites in locations that would have been primarily suitable for exploiting the grazing on the higher mountain slopes. This, as well as other questions, remain to be investigated in future seasons. Louis D. LEVINE Qal'eh-i razdigird The first expedition took place in 1965. The results of that brief survey and sondage were published in Iran V (1967) with the conclusion that the extensive remains belonged to a single complex of build- ings, comprising a palace and stronghold of Sasanian date. The date was derived largely through a process of elimination, for it did not seem possible that a site of such type and dimension could be any- thing else. The rubble masonry of the fortifications, the seemingly rounded towers, and the vertical-lay brick construction of the palace-pavilion all indicated a Sasanian date. So too did the pottery recovered from the surface. Since the standing monuments seemed to represent the remains of a single period of occupation, it was concluded that the strong Parthian characteristics of the stucco architectural decoration were an " archaising " element, a phenomenon by no means uncommon in this period. As a result of new work, it now appears that the fortifications and palace complex were planned and conceived during late Parthian times, with only a reduced form of occupation surviving into Sasanian times.

For over three-quarters of its length the perimeter of the tableland is formed by steep cliffs rising up on the one side, and by a sheer escarpment on the other. The cliffs merge with the higher reaches of the plateau. But the escarpment is the last ledge of the plateau, over- looking the plain of Zohab and the Iraqi border. In antiquity, defensive masonry, together with arrow- slot loopholes, was constructed wherever the escarpment was thought to be an inadequate deterrent. Across the relatively open end of the tableland (on the southeastern side), a more elaborate defensive wall with loopholes and towers was constructed, running from the escarpment in the southwest to the cliffs in the northeast. To protect the tableland from attack from high ground, an upper castle and flank- ing outposts were positioned on isolated pinnacles, overhanging the gorge of Baba Yadgar and enjoying strategic command over both that access route and the surrounding countryside. Sheltered within the hollow of the tableland and protected by the elaborate fortifications are the remains of two major struc- tures. The one, Ja-i Dar, is a heavily buttressed structure, partially covered by the gardens of Zardeh, but clearly forming an L-shaped compound. The structure has yet to be probed in detail, but its massive towers and military character reveal it to be the central castle of the stronghold. The other major feature is a long, rectangular enclosure in which a free-standing block of masonry at its upper end gives it the name locally of Gach Gumbad. Current interpretation suggests that the Gach Gumbad enclosure represents a garden of paradise, with a palace-pavilion at its upper end. The 1965 sondage exposed a small portion of the walls and architectural decoration of this pavilion (Iran V, pl. IV). The area between the two compounds is taken up by a largely natural ridge (Tepe Rash) whose slopes are liberally covered with sherds. The ridge would have been the logical place for the supportive struc- tures of the palatial complex. Preliminary tests had already indicated that the depth of the archaeo- logical debris is slight, if it exists at all. Erosion and farming has disturbed all but the most substantial remains of this part of the settlement. The objectives of the second expedition were threefold: to study more precisely the nature and the density of occupation; to determine the date of the monuments and supportive structures, with a view to judging whether the site had witnessed more than a single period of occupation; and to interpret the function of the site and judge its role in historical terms, in the light of the first two inquiries. We are attempting to analyse the nature of the occupation of the settlement as a whole, and not to restrict the study to an exposure of the decorated pavilion alone. During the past season, in fact, we deliberately avoided the pavilion since the workmen had not yet acquired the skills to cope with the stuccoes, and the expedition did not have the facilities to handle the quantity of material that might be expected. To achieve the objectives of the season, then, three methods of approach were taken. The first was a topo- graphic survey designed to determine the total limits of the site and to plot all visible architectural features. The second was to conduct an intensive surface survey, involving collection and analysis of all sherds found. The third approach was the use of limited test trenches, designed to articulate some of the architectural features, determine dimensions where crucial, and in general to gauge the depth of the archaeological debris. The topographic survey mapped no major features not already known from the first survey, but it produced a more accurate map. While the objective of the survey of surface materials was to cover the entire basin, this season's work was concentrated in the areas adjacent to the monumental features and the fortification wall. Outside the two monumental enclosures, and apart from the dense sherd concentra- tion on the slopes of Tepe Rash, the heaviest sherdage was encountered in a flattish area alongside the main fortification wall. Elsewhere on the site the sherdage was scattered and sporadic. The lack of any material earlier than Parthian was confirmed but what was unexpected was that seemingly Parthian pottery appeared consistently in the areas of both densely concentrated and lightly scattered sherd coverage. Characteristic post-Parthian features were encountered only in the area of Tepe Rash. Some Islamic sherds were recovered from the Upper Castle, where there have been some obvious later building repairs. As far as the history of the site is concerned, then, one might suggest that the fortifica- tions and palatial complex were conceived in late Parthian times, and that some form of occupation continued on a limited scale in Sasanian times, with the Upper Castle serving as a retreat probably as late as Mongol times.</page><page sequence="15">164 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES In the three areas examined by test trench the same picture emerged. First test: two towers and the intermediate length of curtain wall at a point along the fortification wall were probed for dimensions. As it turned out, the towers were square in plan, and not rounded as indicated in the first report. Already one of the strong Sasanian leads was destroyed. In addition, a Parthian date was tentatively confirmed by the sherds found in association with the wall. It was apparent that the inner face of the wall had suffered damage and had been repaired. Neither this repair work nor the occupation asso- ciated with the small chambers within the towers could be dated to anything other than Parthian. In addition, the flattish area adjacent to the wall was tested for remains which might have suggested the presence of a garrison. Low wall stubs and bell-shaped chambers cut into the bed-rock were all that could be found in the limited probe but from these and the numerous storage-jar rim fragments found it was clear that a reasonably permanent type of compartmentalized settlement had existed here, such as would have been appropriate for a garrison. Second test: an area in the north-west corner of the Gach Gumbad enclosure was examined where surface features indicated the presence of a series of chambers around a central courtyard. The three deep chambers which were exposed were virtually devoid of any occupational debris, with only small fragments of fallen plaster revealed in the bottom of the fill. A thick layer of sterile mud comprised most of the fill. The amount of preservation and the depth of the fill is the most interesting aspect of the work accomplished here so far. There is nothing yet to indicate the function of the layout, though the surface indications suggest that it represented the residential and service quarters of the palace. No non- Parthian material was recovered. Third test: an area outside of the Gach Gumbad enclosure was examined where brick-bats, plaster fragments, and broken roof-tiles suggested the presence, outside the gardened enclosure, of a building in the same style as the stuccoed pavilion. However, excavations soon revealed that it was a dump of architectural debris cleared from a ruined building. Of course, the logical source of this material was the stuccoed pavilion, for the dump is close by, though tastefully set on the other side of the garden wall. We know that the pavilion suffered severe damage at one time. It was thought after the 1965 sondage that this damage caused the terminal destruction of the building, but now there is every prospect that we shall find traces of damage caused to the structure, clearance of debris, and repairs made to the build- ing. In view of the nature of the finds from the dump-including carved and painted stuccoes, fresco or painted plaster fragments, and a small portion of mosaic paving-this prospect is an exciting one. The surface survey and the test trenches confirm that the site represents the residence of an important dignitary in a palatial setting, together with all the accoutrements needed to support him in this idyllic, but intensely defensive setting. Since there is strong evidence that the entire complex was conceived in Parthian times, though some features are reminiscent of a Sasanian tradition, it might be logical to place the history of the site in a late Parthian/transitional Sasanian context. It is this period above all which sees the deep fragmentation of empire and the proliferation of petty dynasts who refused to acknowledge the power of an central government. In its defensive position Qal'eh-i Yazdigird makes sense as the home of a feudal lord, thumbing his nose at the King of Kings, and maintaining himself in his gardened enclosure with the luxuries afforded by plundering the highroad at will without fear of reprisal. E. J. KEALL Pusht-i Kuh, Luristan During the autumn of 1973, the ninth season of excavations in Pusht-i Kuh was conducted by the Belgian Archaeological mission of the State University of Ghent in cooperation with the National Centre for Archaeological Research in Iran. Work was concentrated on the necropolis of Dum Gar Parchinah in order to investigate further the antecedents of the Luristan Bronze culture during the Chalcolithic period. The necropolis: The site of Dum Gar Parchinah lies 4 km. to the west of the small village of Cham Zangi (40 kms. to the south of Sarab-i Maimah, administrative centre of the bakhshdari and 14o kms.</page><page sequence="16">SURVEY OF EXCAVATIONS 165 to the south-west of Ilam, capital town of the Ostan Ilam wa Pusht-i Kuh). The graveyard extends over different areas on a plateau along the Maimah River. Two trenches were opened: the first in area A (34 X 17 m.) yielded sixty-four tombs, the second in area B (26 x 21 m.) revealed eighty-nine tombs. The area C sector was badly damaged by clandestine diggings and provided only three tombs. The tombs: In all areas, tombs were found near present surface level. Their orientation is generally north--+south or north by north-east -&gt;south by south-west, while a group in area A shows different positions. The tombs are cist graves, constructed by upright slabs on all four sides and covered by several large ashlars. Long and narrow the chambers measure from I. -60 m. to 200oo m. in length and from o 30 m. to o. 50 m. in width by a depth of c. o. 50 m. A few tombs in area B are more impressive with their bigger dimensions. Remains of skeletons were extremely scarce. Nevertheless a few fragments illustrated that the dead were laid on their backs with the legs stretched out and this explains the rather narrow and elongated shape of the burial chamber. Although tombs are designed for a singly inhumation some (in area B) were used twice. In order to make room for a second body the bones of the first burial were pushed to the ends and sides of the cist. Certain of the bigger tombs in area B yielded several skulls and a mass of bone fragments: they were used undoubtedly as collective graves and probably belonged to one family. The funerary offerings: Only half the excavated tombs revealed a burial since neither bone fragments nor funerary offerings were found in them. Mostly there was only one grave-gift, sometimes two and more exceptionally three objects. Of course, some collective tombs yielded as many as ten different objects. These offerings are generally placed behind the head of the dead or beside the body. They consist of painted and unpainted pottery, stone vessels, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines in baked clay, stone seals and maces, axes, hammer axes, beads, tools and microliths in the same material. The painted pottery can be divided into three groups, according to their decoration techniques. The most common ware has a buff slip with black or brownish-black painting. Red slipped pottery with a black design (unfortunately almost wiped off) is less common and only two jars show a polychrome decor: brownish black and red on buff. Shapes are rather simple and the variety of types is restricted: cups, bowls, goblets, jars with different neck-forms and pedestalled chalices. The jars are often provided with tiny lug handles, pierced vertically or horizontally. The vessels generally have a flat base but flat disc bases appear as well. The patterns are to a great extent geometric, nevertheless representations of animals such as ibexes are characteristic on bowls and goblets of area B. This painted pottery reveals new aspects of the relationship between Pusht-i Kuh, Pish-i Kuh (the valleys of Hulailan and Kuh-i Dasht), Khuzistan and Mesopotamia. The repertoire however shows the evidence for an original style. The unpainted pottery is a brownish buff ware represented by some cups and goblets. The cups have a flared profile and a flat base (some examples in area A have a ring-base). Stone vessels are generally carved in white limestone or grey veined with white. One small specimen is in black basalt. Baked clay figurines: A creamy statuette of a standing nude woman with the hands under her breasts shows marks of black and red painting. A brownish unpainted terracotta figurine represents a bovine species. Stamp seals. According to their forms these seals can be subdivided into three categories: domes, buttons and beads. They were made of marly limestone, light grey or greyish black chlorite. The sealing surface is engraved with geometric patterns or zoomorphic symbolic elements. Stone implements. The tools and implements are made of various kinds of stone. The mace heads are generally in white crystalline but a few black ones are haematite or magnetite. Axes and hammer axes were polished in grey-green jade. The other implements are intended for grinding, milling, crushing and pounding (querns, mortars, pestles, pebbles and palettes). Dating and conclusions: There is a strong link between the archaeological material of the Dum Gar Parchinah necropolis and the Hakalan graveyard (see Iran XI) so they belong to the same culture and the same chronological horizon. However their particular characteristics can be compared with finds at other chalcolithic sites in Iran and Mesopotamia. For Iran, the resemblances are attested at Tepe Giyan V b-c, Tepe Siyalk End II and III, Tall-i Bakun A and Tall-i Gap I. Striking analogies with</page><page sequence="17">166 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES the painted pottery of the early Susa I type are encountered in Pish-i Kuh (Hulailan and Kuh-i Dasht) and Khuzistan (Tepe Band-i Bal, Tepe Buhalan, Tepe Jovi) but in spite of some elements of correlation, the relationship with sites such as Djaffarabad 1-3, Chugha Mish (Middle Susiana Period) and in the Deh Luran area, appear less clearly. In Mesopotamia, comparison is found in the Ubaid strata of different sites (Tell Uqair, Telul Eth Thalathat, Tepe Gawra XVIII-XII, Tello, Eridu VII-VI, Uruk, Ur and El Ubaid) but also to a lesser degree, in some of the Halaf Period strata (Tell Halaf and Tell Chagar Bazar). The archaeological material of Dum Gar Parchinah thus belongs to the Susiana C, and for a part Susiana D, cultural complex of Western Iran. The relation with Mesopotamia is restricted to the Ubaid 2-3 phases apart from some affinities with the stone material of a few Halafian sites. As a result, the Chalcolithic necropolis of Dum Gar Parchinah is dated at the end of the fifth millennium, and the beginning of the fourth millennium B.c. Although, the graves of areas A and B belong to the same cul- ture there appears to be a slight variation between them, which reflects a possible chronological difference: the graves in area B should be a little earlier than those in area A. The necropolis of Dum Gar Parchinah is the first extensive burial ground separate from habitation areas excavated in Western Iran. This means that during the Chalcolithic Period, while customs in Iran as well as in Mesopotamia were still considered with inhumation practices beneath or between the dwellings, the probably nomadic people of the Luristan mountains buried their dead in cist tombs constructed at a site specially intended for them. For this fact and the stone type structure of the graves Dum Gar Parchinah is the oldest known example in Iran and Mesopotamia. Moreover, the finds proved that the origins of the so-called " Luristan Bronze culture " during the Bronze and Iron Age Periods are to be searched for in the Chalcolithic Age, and probably even earlier. Any way there already existed in this area a tradition of exclusive burial customs and characteristic implement shapes which survived into later times. L. VANDEN BERGHE Sarhad Plateau Survey With the aid of funds provided by the National Science Foundation and New York University, the summer of 1975 saw the completion of a four-and-a half month survey on the Sarhad Plateau in northern Baluchestan. In the course of the survey we were able to locate numerous sites which can be compared with camp sites of the present-day pastoral nomads who inhabit the Khash valley, 200 km. south of Zahedan. Of the Io6 sites that were found during the survey, at least twenty-five can be classed as prehistoric on the basis of surface pottery and lithic material. The largest and most prolific of these sites is Khash Spring I, 8 km. north-west of Khash, which was first noted by G. W. Hume in 1966. Here a rocky slope to the east of the present spring exhibits a heavy scatter of artifacts; and a controlled collection procedure yielded 40,000 items. Microliths, ground-stone implements, fragments of chlorite vessels, and buff and grey wares with painted, black geometric designs can be compared to third millennium materials from Shahr-i Sokhta and Bampur. A second aim of the project was to look for traces of Palaeolithic occupation in the Khash Valley. The ten Palaeolithic sites that were eventually located were characterized by artifacts of chert and basalt, primarily in the form of large core tools and unifacially retouched anvil-struck flakes. Several of these Palaeolithic assemblages bear resemblances to the Ladizian Chopper-Chopping Tool industry discovered by the I966 survey of the University of Minnesota, 88 km. north of Khash on the Ladiz Rud terraces. JUDITH T. MARUCHECK Siraf The first season of the Iranian Expedition to Siraf took place from February 19 to April 19, 1975- I would like to express my gratitude to Mr Mansour Sadjadi (Asst. Director) and Mr Abbas Ali Nematollahi (draftsman) for their unfailing help and kindness.</page><page sequence="18">SURVEY OF EXCAVATIONS 167 Our excavations were carried out in four different locations, primarily in the eastern section of Siraf between the Shaikh's fort and the eastern wall. We decided to name the sites after famous men in the history of Siraf, in addition to using the previous system of labelling sites with alphabetical designations. Site Babshad (site U) is located near the shoreline by the eastern wall. We discovered and exca- vated a fort-like building made of stone with a mud and plaster mortar. It measures 21 x 22 metres and has two construction phases. In the main phase this building is composed of a central court with a main entrance to the west and four smaller doorways. Around the courtyard are nine small rooms. The proportions and measurements of the rooms are interesting in that the arrangement is asym- metrical. At the outside corners of the building are four towers, two square and two circular. This is an interesting phenomenon, and so far as I know is exceptional The date of the main construction phase, based on the similarity in construction to other buildings of the period and the objects found in it, is placed at the end of the ninth century A.D. We would propose that the building was used as a fort or military post because of its plan and location by the eastern wall close to the shoreline. Site Mhidn Sirafi (site V) is located 300 m. west of the eastern wall near the shoreline. The exca- vation in this area has not been completed, but the nature of the surface and the material collected on the surface seemed to indicate a group of pottery kilns. Several vessels, fragments of wasters and conelike pottery pegs for hanging pottery in a kiln or for controlling the temperature were found in the test trench. Fragments of vessels broken during firing were found grouped in a pit, presumably a rubbish dump. Layers of ash and burned soil, with a section of floor of an area for preparing the pottery clay, as well as different types of glazed and unglazed fragments of pottery with varying decoration and a stamp with a palmette design for decorating pottery all furnish evidence that this area housed a group of kilns. Site Abu Sa'id Sirafi (site S) is located on the central mound, Ioo m. east of site H. We found a rock-cut building of which we excavated one room. It measures 5 X 5 m. and probably had a flat ceiling, indicated by the presence of hollows in the top surface of one of the walls for setting in wooden beams. The room also had an upper storey for which we found the doorway. The ground floor has a large entrance on the south side and a niche on the outside of the building. On the plastered floor we found a Sasanian coin. Site Abu Zaid Sirafi excavated by the expedition of the British Institute of Persian Studies (site R), is in the north-western part of Siraf east of site O, and west of the rock-cut main cemetery. At site O ten tombs had been excavated, but because of the complicated burial system and the lack of inscriptions, the identification of the religion of the people buried there remained uncertain. It had been proposed that they were Muslim. We decided to excavate another tomb, which is rectangular and measures 13 x 5 m. It has four rectangular buttresses at the outside corners and four column bases inside, two attached to the north wall and two to the south wall. The tomb contained thirty-three individual burials, two of which had an east-west orientation and the rest a north-south orientation. Fourteen of the graves have rectangular covers and the rest oval-shaped covers. In the western section of the tomb there were ten graves with rectangular covers, some of which had inscriptions in ornamental Kufic script in plaster on the sides of the covers. The inscriptions are verses from the Qur'an. The two important results of the excavation of this tomb are proof that tombs of this style and shape are Muslim, and the dating, based on the form of the inscription and style of the decoration, to the 9th-Ioth century A.D./3rd-4th century A.H. H. BAKHTIARI Shahr-i Sokhta The seventh campaign of excavations at Shahr-i Sokhta was carried out under the auspices of IsMEO from September 2 to December I, 1975. The primary aims of the campaign were the complete survey of the site with a first outline of its geological history and the environmental set-up, the extensive stratigraphical testing of the earliest period at the Eastern Residential Area, and the continuation of the excavations at the Graveyard.</page><page sequence="19">168 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES It has been established that the site of Shahr-i Sokhta extends over a surface of 151 -68 hectares. 21 .3 hectares belong to the graveyard which extended across the east-west length of the site. Both settlement and graveyard were set on top of a pliocene terrace. The work of the geographer, 0. Meder, has established the position of this terrace within the general system of terracing outlined for the Hilmand basin. Quite interestingly it has been also ascertained that erosion was already strong on the surface of the site at the time of its protohistorical frequentation. Wind action predominated in the erosion of the western part of the site, whereas water gulleys, mostly south-east oriented, predominated in the Eastern Residential Area. As a result the eastern part of the site rises approximately 8 m. above the rest. A second important reason is due to the nature and date of its anthropic deposits. It is only here, over an area of approximately 15 hectares that we have remains of Period I and dwellings of phase 7 (2750-2650 B.C.) on top, which appear to have been destroyed by an intensive fire and left intact. The exploration of the settlement was carried out in two different excavations. A deep test trench in area XDV-XDW was dug into the levels of period I, phases 8, 9, io, which were exposed to ground level by modern surface erosion. A second extensive excavation was opened by Dr S. Salvatori, 250 m. to the west of the Eastern Residential Area in a westward sloping area where the analysis of aerial photographs had shown the existence of a large architectural complex. The trench in XDV-XDW measured at its beginning 250 square metres whereas at the bottom it was restricted to 40. This trench has allowed us to establish that the town was founded in around 3200 B.c., in phase 10. The material culture was characterized by pottery with strong south Turk- menian ties, together with some sherds of black burnished, trumpet-shaped rims relatable to Yahya IVC. The most impressive find has certainly been a proto-Elamite tablet found at the north-eastern corner of room CCXCIII in the earth filling, Io cms. above the floor of the room, which represents the earliest structural phase found so far at Shahr-i Sokhta. Apart from a few dozen sealings bearing impres- sions of pictographic cylinder seals the rest of the material culture does not exhibit any of the known typical " proto-Elamite " traits. The extensive building in the central part of the site was explored by laying a 50 x 20 metre trench in the south-eastern corner of the building, as delimited by the aerial photograph. There has appeared a regular network of walls, possibly foundations to be ascribed to phase 3 and 4 (2400-2200 B.c.), laid on top and within structures of phase 5. A second test trench 20 X io m. was set across the western wall. This part of the enclosure can be dated to phase 5 (around 2500 B.c.). Quite noteworthy was the excavation of a sequence of layers made by daily house waste, rich in perishable organic materials. This whole deposit was sieved and floated, providing us with a large collection of wood, seeds and textiles. Among others seeds of flax have been recovered. The choice of areas to be opened for excavation at the graveyard was partly based on random numbers, established on a I oX Io m. grid laid over the presumed area of extension. Its uniformity and size would have made impossible either the choice of preferential areas or the availability of a sizeable percentage of the ancient population without sampling. This selection on a random number series has led us to the excavation of areas HRY and HNE respectively to the south and west of the trenches previously excavated. Outside these new areas the earlier excavations were also enlarged, both in squares IPW-INC and in IRX; out of the sixty-six graves discovered in the course of the campaign sixty-four have been excavated, seven of which were empty shafts, both of simple and bipartite types. The other fifty-seven contained between one to a maximum of eight skeletons. The result of the new distribution of the graves seems to indicate that the development of the graveyard took place in suc- cessive clusters which can be localized by some significant concentration of burials in rather restricted areas surrounded by empty spaces. They often exhibit a remarkable similarity in the type of furnishings. This is the case of the so-called group of Nil, a group of six graves in area IR, well characterized by the presence in two of them of the typical cylindrical jars, known from this famous cemetery in southern Baluchistan. Another recurrent element in the burial ritual at Shahr-i Sokhta seems to have been the sacrifice of a kid, a few weeks old, which was generally placed beside the head of the dead. Insofar they seem only associated with graves datable as late as phase 6 (2550 B.C.).

Le palier interm&amp;- diaire, correspondant au sommet du premier degre, est prolonge a l'est par une rampe d'acc&amp;s qui monte selon une pente de 8% le long de la fagade du degre superieur (Pl.

Cette rampe, du c6t6 est, 6tait bordee au sud de plusieurs pieces, separees par des murs align6s sur les pilastres qui flanquent la fagade du degrC supdrieur.

Comme d'autre part la faqade est n'a pas encore 6t6 d6couverte (la fouille ne s'6tant pas 6tendue jusque 1k) il resulte de cette double constatation que l'Fdifice mesurait au moins 8o m. de c6te d'est en ouest, sa hauteur 6tant d'environ 13 m. 50o. En avant de la facade meridionale, et correspondant probablement " la partie mediane de celle-ci, nous avons decouvert un bAtiment qui s'61evait apparemment jusqu'au niveau du premier degr6 et qui etait appuy6 contre la fagade. Nous n'en avons trouve jusqu'" present que le mur oriental et une partie du mur est-ouest parallele a la terrasse (P1. IIa). La destination de cet edifice n'apparait pas encore clairement.

Elles supposent 1'existence des la fin du IIIeme millknaire d'une socikte de caractere 6tatique et centralis6, exergant sur l'6conomie un contr6le suffisant pour pouvoir procdder a l''dification d'un monument aussi gigantesque; nous ignorons cependant si cette soci t6 6tait de caractere palatial ou th6ocratique (la terrasse elle-meme ayant pro- bablement une fonction religieuse). Certains rapprochements semblent s'imposer entre cet edifice et les ziggourats mesopotamiennes d'une part, notamment la ziggourat d'Ur-Narnmu a Ur, qui en est a peu pres contemporaine, et d'autre part, certaines terrasses &amp; degres du Turkmenistan (Altin D6pe) et de l'Afghanistan (Mundigak), de meme date 6galement, analogies que vient renforcer la presence sur des sites de ces deux regions de " colonnettes " identiques ? celles de Tureng T~p6 et de Tfp6 Hissar. 2o) Les niveaux du Ier millinaire.

Ce materiel rappelle 6videmment celui de Madau T6p6, que les archeologues sovietiques datent du VIIIeme siecle. Le Fer III (p6riode IV B) comprend deux couches d'occupation successives, dont le materiel archeologique ne diffbre gu re. Les briques sont toujours de forme rectangulaire mais de beaucoup plus grande taille qu'auparavant (65 cm. x 50 cm. et 8o cm. X 50 cm. dans la premiere phase, 60o cm. x 40 cm. dans la seconde). Nous les avions pr cedemment attribu6es &amp;t tort a l'6poque V A. Le second niveau comporte notamment un tres long mur curviligne (P1.

Il s'agit probablement du mur d'enceinte d'un edifice circulaire, analogue a celui que nous pouvons reconstituer pour la periode suivante (cf. infra); celui du Fer III semble correspondre "&amp; l'poque made. La ceramique comprend une poterie rosatre dont la forme la plus frequente est un bol a lvre epaissie sur les deux faces, et une poterie brun clair lissee, categorie dans laquelle on signalera notam- ment les bols a bord en baionnette qui sont caracteristiques de cette periode dans le nord-ouest de l'Iran. Rappelons que des bols de meme forme ont 6t6 decouverts en 1960 sur le petit tepe; ces derniers parais- sent cependant d'un type plus 6volue et pourraient appartenir a une phase plus recente du Fer III.

JEAN DESHAYES Uruk Villages on the Susiana Plain From I February to 13 May 1975, a team representing the City University of New York, Hunter College and the Muzeh-e Iran-e Bastn conducted surveys and sondages on three small 4th millennium sites. This work was supported by National Science Foundation Grant SOC75-o 1224, and was designed to investigate early state organization in this area. The three sites involved are located in the southwestern quadrant of the Susiana. KS (Khuzistan Survey) 34, a I .88 hectare site, is located 5.~ 4 km. southeast of Susa; KS-54, a 2 48 hectare site, is located 3 *29 km. northeast of Haft Tepe and KS-76, a 2 62 hectare site, is located 9 42 km. east of Haft Tepe. All three sites appeared to contain easily accessible Uruk deposits of perhaps 3800 to 3100 B.c., appeared to be simple agricultural villages, and had been damaged by recent agro-industrial activity and were threatened by further destruction.</page><page sequence="23">172 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES A total of some 150 cubic metres of deposit were excavated during the field season. Preliminary project results may be summarized under a number of headings. Relative Chronology: A Middle Uruk-Late Uruk stratigraphy was obtained at KS-54. This Middle Uruk material is of interest in that it had previously been known on the Susiana largely from surface collections. A significant sample of little known Susiana Early Uruk material was also obtained. Local Exchange: The distribution of two varieties of a centrally produced Early Uruk jar type con- forms to an exchange model in which Centre-Village interaction is linearly and inversely related to Centre-Village distance. This suggests that the two Early Uruk centres of the area (Susa and Abu Fanduweh) were of equivalent functional sizes, and that these centres exercised minimal political con- trol over surrounding villages. Evidence for Late Uruk ceramic production in villages alters our view of centralization of ceramic production. Although we estimate per capita ceramic production to have been five to ten times greater in large centres than in villages, such production can no longer be considered to have been an exclusive large centre function. Social Organization: The presence of major architectural features as well as of presumed scarce and valuable materials such as lapis lazuli and gold in a Late Uruk deposit at KS-54 suggests the unexpected presence of relatively high status individuals in some "villages". GREGORY A. JOHNSON Tepe rahya Project This summer we completed our seventh season of the Tepe Yahya Project. The survey programme has been completed as have the major excavations. Although the report which follows is of a prelimi- nary nature, it represents the last major season of work at Tepe Yahya. Excavations at Tepe Yahya this season concentrated entirely on the third millennium occupation with the additional recovery of 125 square metres of Periods IVA, B, and C. Over the past three seasons it has become evident that our periodization of the third millennium necessitates further refinements. Period IVA represents two major building levels in our major south step-trench and three building levels in our north step-trench. Period IVB should be divided into an upper Period IVB1 and a lower Period IVB,. Period IVB1 is without architecture but has approxiimately 40-80 cm. of deposition. Several surfaces bearing carved chlorite bowls, ceramics, etc. occur wthin this deposit. These surfaces seal the underlying architecture of Period IVB2. Beneath the architecture of IVB2 is the large single structure of Period IVC, which has a totally different alignment. Preliminary analysis suggests a short chronological gap between IVC (c. 3000 B.c.) and IVB2 (c. 2800 B.C.). After this gap there is virtually continuous occupation to the end of Period IVA (c. 19oo B.c.). For Period IVC to date we have recovered over 400 square metres of a single building complex. This past summer we recovered ten Proto-Elamite tablets on three different floors within a single room. The tablets on the uppermost floor were far more complex in nature than those on the lower floors. Five other tablets were found in the rooms of this structure. In addition numerous fragmentary and complete bevelled rim bowls, biconical nose-lugged jars, and cylinder sealings were found throughout the complex. A fired ceramic drain was traced for over eleven metres at which point it extended into the sections. A number of elaborate calcite and chlorite bowls were found as well as decorated copper- bronze pins and a single spear point. Period IVB2 offered little new over our previous seasons. A single shaft-hole, copper-bronze axe, however, was recovered from one of the rooms. IVB1 continued to provide a large number of carved chlorite vessels familiar from previous seasons. From Period IVA we recovered two levels of directly superimposed architecture with direct con- tinuity in ceramics and architectural alignments. From the lowest level we recovered two etched car- nelian beads and a single " terra-cotta " cake with a square sealing impression of a dancing man reminiscent of those found in the Indus. We now begin our final analysis of materials and the prepara- tion of our final report. C. C. LAMBERG-KARLOVSKY</page><page sequence="24">SURVEY OF EXCAVATIONS 173 Tepe Yahya Project: Palaeobotanical Survey Between July 31 and August 23 a general survey of microscopic remains from the Tepe Yahya deposit was undertaken by a water separation technique, similar to that used at Hasanlu in 1974. Although somewhat unsuitable for the coarse texture of the Yahya deposit, I mm. and 2 mm. sieve meshes were adopted in order to guarantee statistical comparability with other samples gathered by us at Shahr-i Sokhta. A total of 8o samples was collected, of which 78 were collected by water separation techniques. Twenty samples were devoid of seeds, a high percentage when compared with other sites sampled in Iran. The samples were from Periods II-VI of the Yahya sequence. This covers one of the longest time spans of palaeobotanical remains presently available on the Iranian Plateau. The topographical conditions around Tepe Yahya are important initial considerations. (The geo- morphological situation around Yahya and the results of pollen analysis from the excavations has been completed and waits publication by Dr. Rodman Snead, Dr. Philip Durgin and Dr. Abraham Solomon.) Tepe Yahya lies on the western edge of a watered flat oval plain, the Soghun Valley, where the availa- bility of subsoil water, comparatively high rainfall, and soil structure allow a high and fairly regular agricultural yield within the closed ring of the mountains. Different environmental subsystems occur at both eastern and western ends of the Soghun Valley: the higher mountain valleys of Tang-i Mordan and Esfandaqeh in the east and the shallow arid depression of Dolatabad to the west. The drop in altitude among these three areas creates distinctive environments in each. Floral associations vary greatly, from the juniper-pistachio-almond at the eastern end of the Valley to tamarisk in the centre of the Dolatabad Valley. Sparse Halymodendron and Artemisia halophitic grasslands characterize the gravel fans on the northern and eastern edges of the Dolatabad depression, bringing to four the principle micro- environments involved in the biotopic exchange of the area. More corrrectly we should look at the Soghun Valley as a pivot within a system based on a broad spectrum of natural resources in which an economic circuit is the direct result of human land use. From a purely ethnobotanical point of view the effectiveness of such a circuit is best demonstrated by the paleobotanical finds in Period V. From this period botanical remains from all the above mentioned micro-environments were recovered: pistachio and juniper nutshells from the highland forested valleys; wheat from the Soghun Plain; and barley, Chenopodiaceae grasses and tamarisk wood more suited to the drier conditions of the Dolatabad Plain. Given these objective conditions, the reliability of our data from Tepe Yahya had to be completed by ethnobotanical remains from the other areas. No prehistoric sites being presently known from the mountain valleys to the east of Soghun, sampling was limited to the numerous neolithic and chalcolithic mounds surveyed by the Yahya expedition (by Martha Prickett) in the Dolatabad Plain. Samples were gathered from existing erosion faces and one cut section. Site R 37 at the edge of the tamerisks was sampled for Period VI. Site R 12 on the northern gravel fans was sampled for Period V. In general the mound of Yahya is poor in ethnobotanical remains. This is primarily due to the type of deposit which consists of decayed bricks, super-imposed mud floors, ovens and kilns with debris piled to the side. Limited granulometric tests show a high percentage of the deposit consists of 5 mm. lumps resulting from decayed khesht with less than 20% passing through the 2 mm. screen. Such a coarse texture limits the survival of palaeobotanical remains. The only concentration of seeds was found in storage jars or hoards in room areas. Only for Period VI, characterized in trench D by small storage rooms, were deposits of lighter textures found with fair concentrations of seeds in each sample (5000 cc.). A second more complex cause for the lack of seeds in the Tepe Yahya samples results from the specific types of functional areas excavated. The processing of plants, as well as their consumption, would not be expected in all areas excavated. We suspect this might be particularly true for the steatite-working areas in Period IVB or for the Proto-Elamite building of Period IVC. In both instances, however, grains of cultivated cereals are found exclusively in storage jars. It seems that the circulation of seeds within the community was tightly controlled with only consumption (as opposed to full processing) taking place on the site. This picture changes in Period IVA where there is evidence of wheat and barley throughout the deposit. In this same period we recovered a storage jar from the corner of a room which contained 25 lentils, cereals and wild grasses. The find of lentils is quite significant. The cultivation of pulses is presently restricted to small plots in mountainous areas and is rare in the eastern half of the Iranian</page><page sequence="25">174 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Plateau. Protein rich cultigens appear to be almost restricted to cultivated cereals and wild Chenopodia- ceae in this area of southeastern Iran. The scarcity of finds at Yahya is reversed for the Dolatabad Plain. Both R 37 and R I2 have high concentrations of seeds in the eight samples taken. Perhaps the mixed village economy with the absence of the sharply differentiated activity functions found at Yahya allowed for a more casual distribution of grains and other seeds. Slightly less than a thousand seeds were recovered from Yahya this season. This relatively low num- ber will be integrated with the several hoards of seeds found in past seasons and with the significant materials found in previous flotation attempts. The purpose of our participation in the Yahya Project was to gather a statistical distribution of all the plants in the deposit in order to make the site comparable to others and to recover the following items: (I) wild plants uncollected by man but environmentally significant; (2) seeds from cultivated plants of economic value such as grapes and Cucurbitae; and (3) other microscopic remains significant for both environment and economy such as arthropods, snails, egg- shells, and microfaunal bones. As usual this type of research requires long painstaking work before a meaningful picture begins to emerge. Nevertheless some generic statements are possible at this time: I. The evolution of farming in the Soghun Valley is to be identified with changes in the cultivation of wheat. In general there is a progressive introduction of bread wheat in Period V and a concomitant abandonment of emmer which is totally predominant in Period VI. This change highlights a progressive control over the species Triticum which takes place at Yahya in the second half of the fifth millennium B.C.. The presence of goat's face grass (Aegylops squarrosa) within all samples from Period VI provides further evidence of its role as donor of genome D to tetraploid wheats, producing the hexaploid species through natural crossing. The works of Kihara and McFadden and Sears have already tested the above hypo- thesis but archaeological evidence is still very limited. The progressive disappearance of emmer and goat's face grass at Yahya during the fourth millennium B.c. can be seen as an indirect consequence of increasing specialization in farming. On the one hand, the hexaploid species substitutes for the tetra- ploid one, while on the other, the fields are kept free of intrusive, useless grasses. II. Throughout the Yahya sequence wheat is predominant over barley. The ratio of 8:I is unusual when compared with other known sites on the Iranian Plateau and in Central Asia. III. Imported pistachio are found throughout the sequence. IV. Club-rush (Scirpus spp.) and other swamp plants are present in all the prehistoric periods al- though they decrease slightly in the fourth millennium B.C. V. Egg-shells, bird bones, and sweet water fishes are rare in the sequence. Protein was gathered almost entirely from the large mammals. Vegetal protein and fat were limited to cereals and pistachio. A single intact seed of flax was found at R 12 in the Dolatabad section. VI. Grapes are rare. The only reliable pips are from Room 7, the so-called kitchen, in Strata i i of the Proto-Elamite building. MAURIZIO TosI Tepe rahya Project: Soghun Valley Survey Tepe Yahya is located in the southwest corner of the Ioo km.2 Soghun valley. During July and August of 1975 an intensive foot survey of this valley was carried out to determine what sort of local settlement patterns were associated with the different periods of occupation on the mound. In this Ioo km.2 area we recorded a total of 21 mounds and 20 surface sites. In all cases water availability ap- pears to have been a critical factor in the choice of site location. Overall the survey revealed dramatic changes in the distribution of sites in successive periods and some major fluctuations in the valley's population through time. There were no sites found that definitely could be dated to Yahya Periods VI and VC. Evidently this initial phase of settlement in the valley was restricted to Yahya itself. This absence of sites is in contrast to the situation in the Dolatabad valley immediately to the west, where Martha Prickett has found several substantial Period VI mounds. The first settlements off the mound appear early in the fourth millennium, with a series of surface sites dating to Yahya Periods VB through IVC. All the sites are situated on alluvial gravels or low</page><page sequence="26">SURVEY OF EXCAVATIONS 175 hillocks at the edges of the valley, 6 in the southwest corner of the valley in the vicinity of Yahya and 2 at the valley's south end near natural springs. Perhaps because of their location on slopes, the sites have eroded badly, leaving only a dense surface scatter of sherds overlying less than 50 cm. of deposit. The largest of these sites covers almost 10 hectares and lies less than a kilometer from Yahya. Among the sherds collected was a small percentage with white and black paint on red ware. This ceramic type does not appear at all at Yahya and may indicate a period of occupation in the valley between Periods VA and IVC. For Period IVB few sherds and no real sites were found off the mound. The only place IVB sherds appear in any quantity is on the large VB-IVC site mentioned above, where occupation appears to have continued in a more limited area into this period and where three fragments of unfinished chlorite bowls of IVB style were found on the surface. This apparent low level of local population in a period when chlorite production and foreign trade at Yahya were at their height is most curious. Quite a high density of IVA sherds has been found in the area immediately around the mound and extending out in most directions up to 500 metres. Nowhere else in the valley, however, were any significant concentrations of IVA pottery found. It would appear, then, that there was a population buildup in this period but that it was concentrated around Yahya itself. The abandonment of the mound for most of the second millennium B.C. seems to apply also to the valley as a whole. When occupation resumes at the end of the second millennium (Period III), a new demographic pattern has emerged. Now for the first time the central and eastern portions of the valley are settled: here 6 mounds of Period III through I date were recorded, the largest of which is 6 metres high. None of these mounds is over a hectare in extent. The proximity of most of the sites to ancient qanat outlets suggests that this population shift was made possible by the introduction of the qanat. The Islamic period in the valley, from the 9th to 15th centuries A.D., represents the era of greatest of pulation density, although by this time Yahya was no longer inhabited. 12 mounds with evidence poIslamic occupation were found in the central portion of the valley, none of them exceeding a hectare. At the south end of the valley lies the Islamic site of Dasht-i Deh, excavated by Andrew Williamson (Iran IX (1971), p. 182), and at the valley's far north end was found a sprawling agglomeration of low Islamic mounds covering about 33 hectares and collectively known as Tepe Shir Ali. THOMAS WIGHT BEALE Tepe Tahya Project: Upper Rud-i Gushk Survey A surface survey has been conducted over an area of c. 6oo sq. km. on the upper Rud-i Gushk drain- age, southern Kirman Province. The work was carried out under the auspices of the Tepe Yahya Project fromJune 1973 toJanuary 1974 and fromJuly to September 1975. Activity was focused between the towns of Dolatabad and Shah Maran, approximately 25 to 60o km. west of Tepe Yahya. The Rud-i Gushk is a major non-perennial river arising from the southern Kirman highlands at elevations as great as 3,300 m. It enters the Dolatabad basin from the north through a wide system of braided seasonal flood channels across a broad alluvial fan. The Dolatabad basin itself is silt and sand covered clay playa surrounded by these aggrading boulder and gravel fans. It is surrounded on three sides by peaks rising over I,ooo m. above the plain. The centre is a broad flat area of more than 15 by 27 km. lying between I02O and Io8o m., which is approximately 450 to 500 m. lower than the Soghun Valley. Ecologically the region is semi-arid desert steppe with an estimated annual rainfall c. 150 mm. (Robert Raikes, personal communication). Precipitation occurs predominantly as winter rainfall, although over io% occurs during high-intensity summer thunderstorms accompanied by flash flooding. Air temperatures are generally several degrees centigrade warmer than at Tepe Yahya, and the annual rainfall is approximately I oo to 105 mm. less. However, the ground water supply is supplemented by the size and elevation of the upper catchment area to the north of the basin. One hundred and forty-four sites, varying from surface scatters of under .03 ha. to major mounds of as much as 83 ha. were located within this area. In addition, reconnaissance revealed over twenty sites in adjoining valley systems, although intensive work in these areas was not attempted. The sites have been dated by correlation of surface pottery to that from excavated contexts at Tepe Yahya. Those periods not represented at Yahya are dated by relation to other materials of Kirman</page><page sequence="27">176 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES and Fars Provinces. Initial analysis of the pottery indicates site components of the following periods: Yahya VI 12 sites; Yahya VB 23 sites; Yahya VA 52 sites; Tal-i Iblis IV (Aliabad) 27 sites; Yahya II 2 sites; Sasanian (predominantly Late) 40 sites; and Early Islamic through Late Mediaeval 21 sites. Two discrete, almost mutually exclusive areas and patterns of settlement have been found, separated by almost 3,000 years with no discernable occupation remains. The earlier, prehistoric settlement of the 5th and 4th millennia B.C. occurs predominantly in the eastern area of the basin. Survey evidence indicates that this initial occupation begins clustered on the edge of the silts at the toe of the fan near the Rud-i Gushk distributary channels. Here are located a group of seven mounds of Yahya VI and possibly earlier. Among these sites are the largest of the pre-historic mounds. The evidence of carbonized grain and bones of domesticated cattle, sheep, and goat indicate an already well-developed pattern of large agricultural villages. Several of these mounds reveal on the surface the wall lines of the multi-roomed house complexes typical of Yahya VI. Following this period, during the first half of the 4th millennium B.C. (Yahya VB and VA), site locations demonstrate the extension of settlement upstream with the added occupation of the fan itself' in conjunction with continued settlement on the fan-toe silts. Although these fan sites are smaller in size, there has been a great increase in total site number, despite the much shorter time span represented. These sites on the fan are related in an area of c. 4 sq. km. to flood irrigation terraces. The relative position of the boulder field-walls of these terraces (some still retaining silt patches) and several prob- able canals to the mounds and the braided river channels indicates the reliance on river flood waters for agricultural production. Minor testing has demonstrated that the fan area fields were capable of producing the full range of cultigens, including wheat, barley, flax, and pulses (Tosi, personal com- munication). During the succeeding Tal-i Iblis IV (Aliabad) Period (re-estimated to c. 3,400-3,200 B.C.) only some of the earlier Yahya VA mounds continue with minor occupations. There is a decrease in site number as well as a more generally dispersed pattern. New settlements occur on several points of higher elevation and near localized surface water sources along the northern and southeastern fan edges. Al- though some valley edge locations were utilized during the preceding Yahya VA Period, now, with the decrease in concentrated settlement elsewhere, they become a major element of the total settlement picture. The strong implication from settlement location is that the flood irrigation terrace system was already largely in disuse. By the end of the Tal-i Iblis IV Period (probably with the commencement of Yahya IVC) there is a total disappearance of occupation in the basin, although it does occur in adjacent valleys to the south and east. Late in the first millennium B.C. a totally new area and pattern of settlement is developed in the western portion of the basin. This re-occupation of the valley in historical times was related to the introduction of new techniques of water supply -with the development of qanat technology. This is indicated by settlement location far from even the most meagre surface water sources, the linearity of settlement, and occasionally preserved evidence of old qanat lines. Although only two settlements of Yahya II date have been identified, by Late Sasanian times the western area became a major centre of settlement, with towns, villages, farmsteads, hill fortresses, and chahar taqs (the standing ones were reported by Vanden Berghe, Iranica Antiqua I). The nature and the locations of settlement strongly imply substantial administrative supervision and military control. Through mediaeval and modern times this reliance on qanat water supplies maintained settlement on the valley silts of the western portion of the valley. However, settlement does spread somewhat east- ward to tap the entering ground water of the Rud-i Gushk fan. The areas of silts and fan utilized in prehistoric times show no substantive evidence of reoccupation, except with the introduction of diesel pump agriculture on the flat silts within the past twelve years. The forthcoming archaeological analysis is being supplemented by the contributions of Robert Raikes (hydrology), T. J. Wilkinson (geomorphology), Maurizio Tosi (flora), Abraham Solomon (pollens), and Richard Meadow (fauna), to all of whom I am indebted. M. E. PRICKETT</page></plain_text>
