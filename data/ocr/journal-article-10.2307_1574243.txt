<plain_text><page sequence="1">typography he also used. He was particularly attracted by photographs as reproduced in newspapers and magazines, wherein the medium of ink on paper had transformed them not only visually but also in terms of their socio-historical function; they served as convenient references to the realities that the artist ridiculed, satirized and, ultimately, tried to transform. Each photographic reproduction that Hausmann incorporated into a dadaist photomontage supplied a whole set of references to the print and communication media as well. Much more than mere historical or cultural artifacts, such images were further modified in their meanings by new arrangements, new juxtaposi- tions and contexts. With reproductions of photographs, the dadaists also were able to question traditional academic views of visual art through this machine imagery (camera images altered by the printing press). For anyone who has studied the Dada movement, of course, this is more or less familiar ground. While this book includes illustrations of Hausmann's famous dadaist photomontages, more importantly it offers examples of the artist's own photographs. He was careful to call his photographs 'research' rather than finished art, but un- questionably many of these pictures are remarkable, self- sufficient works of art. The 'straight' photographs of found objects are perhaps the least inspired, but there are also handsome motion studies, explorations of the play of light and shadow, visual effects, photomontages made with his own photographs, cameraless 'photograms' and various other examples of delightful but disciplined uses of photographic techniques and materials. The work is generally reminiscent of Laszlo Moholy-Nagy's photographs during the same period, the 1930s and 1940s, but it stands on its own. This work should force a re-evaluation of the major influences in photographic 'experimentation' during this fertile period. The book is divided into three sections: Festival Dada (1918-1923); Transformations photographiques (1924-1939) and Matiere-Collage (1940-1971), each section being equipped with a separate chronology and with statements and articles by Hausmann. Most of the second section deals with 'straight' or unmanipulated photographs, such as a fine study of the play of light on beer suds in a glass in Hausmann's own self-portrait, but several photomontages of the 1930s are included. At points, his later work, seen in the third section, is introspective and retrospective, as in a 1957 photograph involving super- impositions of his own well-known sculptural assemblage of 1919, the 'T&amp;e mecanique'. The book is a well-organized, definitive and useful sourcebook on Hausmann's use of and attitudes toward photography. It clearly indicates that his later and lesser-known work deserves critical attention, not only by historians of photography, but by historians of 20th-century visual art in general. Vadim Sidur. Karl Eimermacher. (In German) Universitatsverlag, Constance, Ger. Fed. Rep. 1978. 168 pp., illus. DM 39.80. Reviewed by John E. Bowlt This is the second monograph on the Soviet artist Vadimir Sidur (b. 1924), one of the more interesting sculptors and book illustrators working in Moscow today. The first monograph (S. Grishin, Vadim Sidur, Adelaide, 1972) introduced the artist's work to Western readers; but this new book examines the sculpture and graphics in more detail, provides a comprehensive bibliography, a biographical scheme and a list of illustrated books. Eimermacher presents a serious appraisal of Sidur's artistic career from the early works of the 1950s to the provocative 'found art' of the 1970s. The author places Sidur within the general context of Soviet culture, arguing, convinc- ingly, that Sidur represents a new Realism in Soviet sculpture after the outmoded canon of Socialist Realism. Eimermacher is careful, however, not to classify Sidur either as 'dissident' or as sympathizer of the 'establishment', and implies that such categories have little to do with the real meaning and worth of Sidur's art. Sidur's latest endeavors, i.e. the specimens of 'found art', take introductory essays by J. E. Bowit and by D. V. Sarabianov. Had it been possible to include a few major works of Socialist Realists of the early and mid-1930s, the significance of the two post- revolutionary decades might have been even more apparent. Even without this, the exhibition succeeds in making a very important point: until the dominant current of representational art in Russia from 1700 to the 1950s is fully analyzed and understood, it will be quite impossible to appreciate correctly the place of rival tendencies in the overall development. Brancusi/The Kiss. Sidney Geist. Harper &amp; Row, New York. 1978. 111 pp., illus. Paper ?3.95. Reviewed by Eugen Ciuca* In the first chapter of this book, entitled Theme, the author analyzes in much detail Brancusi's first version of 'The Kiss' (1907), as regards both the sculpture's artistic qualities and its method of execution. He says: 'for, surely, one of the revelations of "The Kiss" was the necessity of direct carving as a way both of working and thinking' (p. 9). His short discussion of direct carving is, perhaps, useful for students, but they should be warned that he is wrong when he calls it 'primitivistic carving' on the basis of the sculptures made by painters such as Gauguin and Derain. Brancusi's direct carving is not similar to that of these painters. He recognizes Brancusi's artistic talent, when he says: "'The Kiss"... is a work of sheer art' (p. 12). But he concludes his first chapter with doubts about Brancusi's originality by using terms such as 'very like' (p. 16), 'surprisingly similar' (p. 18), 'influenced by' (p. 19) and 'directly indebted' (p. 37)'. On page 40 he says: 'The factors that seem most directly to have contributed to the creation of Brancusi's "The Kiss" are three: Derain's exhibition; Matisse's paintings; and the meetings with Morice.' From this I would be led to conclude that Brancusi was not very talented as a sculptor of originality. The second chapter, entitled Variations, is devoted to a didactic analysis of the visual characteristics of the variations of 'The Kiss' that Brancusi made between 1908 and 1945, the last entitled 'Boundary Marker'. Geist makes assertions about these works that I find highly tendentious. For example, he writes: 'Brancusi's invention is only a slight variation of a type of pilaster or decorative panel which exists since the Renaissance' (p. 57). 'Essentially, Brancusi has altered the Renaissance design by introducing the deep vertical channel' (p. 58). But Geist does not understand that Brancusi was interested in figurative fine art, not in decorative art. The third chapter, entitled In Time, consists of a general commentary and of conclusions drawn by Geist from the analyses presented in the first two chapters. It left me, as a sculptor, convinced that he understood very little about Brancusi's variations of 'The Kiss'. Raoul Hausmann: Je ne suis pas un photographe. (In French) Michel Giroud, ed. Editions du Chene, Paris, 1975. 160 pp., illus. Reviewed by David Haberstich** This book, a tribute to Raoul Hausmann, unequestionably one of the pre-eminent Dada luminaries, is also a provocative document about the role of photographic imagery in visual art. The paradoxical sub-title is explained early in the Avertissement; as if one had not already guessed, the reason Hausmann did not consider himself a photographer was that he never sought to reproduce that which he saw but preferred to 'enlarge and transform vision' through photographic techniques. One might have quibbled with him (and doubtlessly certain photographer/ artists did) that it is, indeed, within the purview of any sensitive photographer to 'enlarge and transform vision', not simply to record or to duplicate reality. Initially, to be sure, he in his Dada 'salad' days was not a photographer at all, because he employed the photographs of others in his photomontages. Photographs and photographic reproductions were raw material, like the *21 Shore Lane, Bay Shore, NY 11706, U.S.A. **Div. of Photographic History, National Museum of History and Technology, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC 20560, U.S.A. various anthropomorphic forms in conglomerations of ma- tDept of Slavic Languages, University of Texas, Box 7217, Austin, TX 78712, U.S.A.
