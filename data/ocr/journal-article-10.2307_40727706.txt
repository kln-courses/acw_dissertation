<plain_text><page sequence="1">Al-Ghazali and Maimonides on the World to Come and Spiritual Pleasures1 Amira Eran Introduction The nature of the pleasures awaiting man after his death have been described by Al-Ghazali (1058-1 111) as the bone of contention between religious philosophy and traditional belief.2 Indeed, the innovation and the conformity of the interpretations to the sacred writings were shaped according to the preference for allegorical or literal readings of those texts. The more philosophical the interpretation was, the more radical it was, and the more influenced by the inclination to read the Bible or the Qur'an's sensual pictures as metaphors of intellectual situations and abstract concepts. In the realm of otherworldly affairs, the philosophers tended to see the vivid descriptions of the carnal enjoyments promised to righteous believers as no more than parables. Although the Bible is not to be compared with the Qur'an and its colorful, detailed images of hell and paradise, the last hour and judgment day, Jewish thinkers also endeavored to minimize the impression of assigning anthropomorphic attributes to the divine realm.3 Al-Ghazali accuses the philosophers of 1 My deepest thanks to Prof. H.

Later on, when Ibn Rushd (1126-1198) takes up the challenge to defend against these charges, he leaves the matter of the otherworldly pleasures vague. His move is not surprising; the majority of philosophers, who usually did not hesitate to uncover the hidden true meaning of Scripture, preferred, in the delicate matter of the notion of the afterlife, to remain silent, or to pay lip service to the common unsophisticated belief in the old version of "physical immortality". No doubt Ibn Rushd, like other politically oriented philosophers, considered the belief in punishment or reward in the hereafter to be the most efficient instrument to make people obey the law, whenever it seems to conflict with their immediate wants and direct interests.6 To be exact, Al-Ghazali did not blame the philosophers for their total rejection of the immortality of the soul, but only for their opposition to the lasting existence of the body, or to its revival with the resurrection of the dead in the days of redemption. In the following discussion I hope to show that Al-Ghazali himself was not too far away from the "philoso- phical" point of view, and that his utterances provided Maimonides with a cover in his struggle against the naive interpreters of the Torah. Mai- monides was not the first philosopher, whose constant efforts to elevate faith to an intellectual level were seen as contradictory to the written promises of the holy texts. monides", Medieval Encounters 4, Leiden 1998, p. 54, note 12. The indication of the bodily resurrection in the sacred scriptures played a central role in inter-religious po- lemics. The philosophical position, despite its intensive involvement in confrontations with fanatic orthodoxy, was part of this fight as well. Nevertheless, the tone of theo- dicy, which is prominent in the Jewish apocalyptic literature, where the End of Days is the time when all wrongs are righted, is missing in the Muslim picture, and conse- quently in Al-Ghazali's concept of the next world.

McKane, Leiden 1962, Introduction, p. xvi. 4 See Al-Ghazali, Tahafut al-falasifah (above, note 2), p. 249: "To brand the philo- sophers with infidelity is inevitable, so far as three problems are concerned-namely....

They only changed its nature radically, claiming the undoubted super- iority of spiritual pleasures over the physical, and identifying the immor- tality of the soul-intellect with the eternity of the truth. The philoso- phers took pains to prove that there was a categorical difference between those parts of the human soul which are connected with the working of the bodily organs (the vegetative and the animate souls), and the essence of that part of the soul which concerns the human mind (the rational soul). The conclusion, which derives from that proof, is far simpler than its initial assumption. It argues that if the rational soul is not a part of the body, it should not necessarily perish with the destruction of the body.7 Yet, the philosophical answers to the question, "What is by defi- nition eternal, the soul, or the knowledge that the soul possesses?" were different. In most cases the dominant answer of the Aristotelian school was that the soul becomes immortal only through meditating, when it unites with the active intellect, the last of the ten intellects originating in God, and transmitting His intellectual emanation.8 According to this school of thought, intellectuality is the common basis of God and man, and it alone allows the communication between supreme divine thought and the limited human mind.9 The more intellectualism served to make the philosopher become closer to God, the more it worked to remove the ordinary simple believer from Him. In the same manner, the notion of happiness assumed an elitist significance when it was re- phrased to suit the strict demands of philosophy. It no longer meant a sensuous feeling of joy, but a spiritual perfection of the intellect. Follow- ing Aristotle's definition as man's final end,10 happiness was identified with the self-realization of man's peculiar virtue, the intellect, another noble characteristic that contributed to the difficulty of seeing happiness in the image of bodily pleasures, all the more of achieving it. To sum up: 7 See ibid., V. 1, p. 344; cf. my "Avicenna's Influence on Ibn Daud's Proof of the Immortality of the Soul" [Hebrew], Daat 31 (summer 1993), pp. 6-25. 8 Cf., Ibn Rushd, Tahfut al-Tahafut (above note 5), pp. 356-358; ibid., V. 2, p. 202, note 3 to p. 357. 9 Cf.

Ross, New York 1990, pp. Uff.</page><page sequence="4">140 Amira Eran JSQ 8 happiness is longed for by the philosophers, because (1) it is the only way to resemble God, or reach Him, or enjoy divine providence;11 (2) it is the actualization of proper humanity and the true realization of the human species; and (3) it is the only way to gain immortality, or, as it is described by Maimonides, to inherit the world to come.12 Those philosophical observations form the opposition front to the literal readings of Scripture and oral tradition in Islam and in Judaism. The common interests of religious philosophy inspired by the Aristote- lian heritage,13 yielded a similarity in theory and expressions, which bridge the difference in practice and ceremony between Moslem and Jewish thinkers. I wish to devote the following discussion to this im- pressive similarity. I shall focus on the possible influence of Al-Ghazali on Maimonides, which has been already noticed by scholars,14 despite the fact that Maimonides never mentions Al-Ghazali, either directly or indirectly. 11 See, e. g., Maimonides' expression in The Guide of the Perplexed, III. 18 (Sh. Pines translation, Chicago and London, 1963, p. 475 [hereafter referred to as "Guide"]): "For it is this measure of the overflow of the divine intellect that makes the prophets [= phi- losophers] speak, guides the actions of the righteous men, and perfects the knowledge of excellent men with regard to what they know. As for the ignorant and disobedient, their state is despicable proportionately to their lack of this overflow, and they have been relegated to the rank of the individuals of all other species of animals". Cf. ibid., III.51. 12 See Introduction (above, note 9) p. 39, note 3, which discusses Maimonides con- cept of immortality. Sh. Pines has suggested that Maimonides did not really believe even in the immortality of the souls of men of exemplary. See Sh. Pines, "The Limita- tions of Human Knowledge according to Al-Farabi, Ibn Bajja and Maimonides", Stu- dies in Medieval Jewish History and Literature, ed. I. Twersky, Cambridge, MA 1979, pp. 82-109. Pines' attitude stands in conflict with the general spirit of this paper, but it proves the immortal influence and continuous inspiration of his. Cf. also A. Altmann, "Maimonides on the Intellect and the Scope of Metaphysics," in his Von der mittelal- terlichen zur modernen Aufklärung, Tübingen 1987, pp. 60-129. 13 When discussing Aristotelian orientation, one should view it as differing from the Stoic doctrine, which attaches higher value to reason, and consequently sees it as the only instrument to be free from the fear of death and from the enslavement to the passions of the body. ** ror a detailed historical survey, see i&gt;. Harvey, Al-unazaii ana Maimomaes on Their books of Knowledge" (in press). I am most grateful to Prof. Harvey for allowing me to read his paper, and for his other most helpful comments. Sh. Pines, in his famous introduction to the Guide (above, note 11), indicates that it is most probable that Maimonides knew the works of Al-Ghazali, and especially his critique on the "philo- sophers", pp. cxxvi-viii [Hebrew], Jerusalem 1977, p. 167.</page><page sequence="5">(2001) Al-Ghazali and Maimonides 141 Avicenna and Maimonides on spiritual pleasures and the immortality of the soul It has been recently suggested by Dov Schwartz,15 and subsequently by Sarah Stroumsa,16 that Maimonides' Introduction to Sanhédrin, chapter 10 (known as "Pereq Heleq") was influenced by Avicenna (980-1037). More specifically, both scholars have argued that the striking textual similarity between Avicenna and Maimonides' choice of words proves the latter's dependence on his Muslim predecessor, despite the no less striking discrepancy between their theoretical concepts of the afterlife.17 The basis for the comparison between Avicenna and Maimonides is a passage in the introduction to "Pereq Heleq", where Maimonides illus- trates the chasm between this world - the world of the bodies - and the other world - the world of incorporeal existence - in a metaphor which runs as follows: Know that just as a blind man can form no idea of colors, nor a deaf man comprehend sounds, nor a eunuch feel the desire for sexual intercourse, so the bodies cannot comprehend the delights of the world of spirit unknown to this world of flesh. {Introduction, p. 38). 18 One may reasonably argue that the origin of this metaphor can be found in the following words of Avicenna, repeated with minor variations in several of his writings: We are not capable of picturing the qualifications or of sensing the de- lights of what is not perceived [by the mind]. And what we do not perceive, we do not desire, nor do we long for it. [We behave] like the eunuch, who does not long for the pleasure of sexual intercourse nor does he miss it in any way, because he cannot picture in his imagination the taste of that kind of pleasure, although he knows that it gives pleasure. This is also the state of people who were born blind in respect to beautiful pictures, and that of deaf people with respect to the harmonious melodies.19 15 D.

This metaphor is repeated with slight modifications in other writings of Avicenna, see, e.g., id., Ahwal al-Nafs, Cairo 1952, chapter 15, pp. 128-129; id., Tis' Rasa il fi al-Hikma waï-Ilahiyyat, Cairo 1908, p. 54</page><page sequence="6">142 Amira Eran JSQ 8 In light of this passage and two other arguments, Dov Schwartz con- cludes, that "there can be no doubt, I believe, that the relevant passages from Avicenna's Kitab al-Najat were known to Maimonides, either in their original form or in paraphrase, and that Maimonides shaped his doctrine of the intellect's or soul's experience in the afterlife in accordance with Avicenna's".20 One of the two other arguments that he mentions states that the fact that people are ready to restrain their sexual compul- sions in order not to touch their honor, proves that they prefer spiritual pleasures over the physical ones even in this world. The second argument, claimed to be drawn from Avicenna, denotes that even entities abstracted of matter, like the separate intellects, enjoy spiritual pleasures.21 Despite these similarities, Schwartz points to essential differences between the doctrines of Avicenna and Maimonides, especially with re- spect to the destiny of the soul after the death of the body. Stroumsa accepts Schwartz' final conclusion,22 shortly before she exposes concep- tual differences between the two thinkers: "Avicenna's way of handling the subject of paradise probably set for Maimonides the example of how to negotiate between philosophy and his own religious tradition".23 Among their differences of views, she counts Maimonides' denial of corporeal pleasure in the hereafter,24 and Maimonides' denial of indivi- dual survival of the soul.25 Indeed, the majority of scholars, who dealt with Avicenna's concept of the immortality of the soul, agree that he believed one way or the other, in a sort of material reward and punish- ment that the soul experiences after the death of the body.26 It may be remarked, in this connection, that Avicenna's belief in corporeal suffer- ing and joy is part of his adherence to Neo-Platonism and ought not to be excused as mere lip-service to the naive believers who may have con- 20 Schwartz, (above, note 15), p. 188. 21 Cf.

Avicenna saw matter as the source for all sorts of deficiencies, stretching from physical disability to ignorance of the mind.27 Al-Ghazali and Maimonides on spiritual pleasures and the final reward We have seen that the textual resemblance between Avicenna and Mai- monides made scholars ignore the differences in their doctrines and sug- gest that the latter is dependent on the former. I shall attempt to explain these differences of views between Avicenna and Maimonides, by prov- ing that it is Al-Ghazali, who had a direct influence on Maimonides in this instance. It is true that in many cases, and also in this case, Al- Ghazali serves as a mouthpiece of Avicenna, but at the same time he is inserting his own philosophical views, often disguised as critiques of the very same philosopher.28 The same holds for Maimonides, who - as Stroumsa convincingly argues -29 imitates the fascinating intellectual maneuvers of his Muslim predecessor, in order to camouflage his radic- alism with moderate conformity. 1 . Al-Ghazali's versions of the eunuch metaphor and of the angels' delights Al-Ghazali's version of the eunuch metaphor, is a rather faithful reflec- tion of its Avicennean origin. In this version, the unquestioned supe- riority of the spiritual pleasures over the physical is supported by two arguments: (1) The argument that the angels also exercise incorporeal delights, and (2) the argument that on the scale of human priorities, preference is given to spiritual pleasures, such as victory and a good reputation. 27 This view is also found in Ibn Daud's and Maimonides' concept of evil. See my "The Concept of Evil in Ibn Daud's The Exalted Faith and Its Relations to Free Choice", in: M. Avalli, ed., Tura - Studies in Jewish Thoght, Tel-Aviv 1989, pp. 261- 269 [Hebrew].

There are two arguments to prove that intellectual pleasures are worthier than physical pleasures. (1) Firstly the state of angels is nobler than that of beasts and swine. Now the angels do not experience sensuous pleasures like those of mating and eating. Their pleasures consist in the consciousness of the perfection and beauty, which characterize them because of their insight into the realities of things.... (2) Secondly, man himself often prefers intellectual pleasures to sensuous pleasures. For instance, one who seeks victory over an enemy renounces for its sake the comfort of home and hearth.... Similarly, one who is interested in the maintenance of his dignity and prestige hesitates to deal with his mistress in such a way as to be known to others (Tahafut al-Falasifah, Ka- mali's translation, p. 230-231). The same idea is repeated in other writings of Al-Ghazali. For instance: The pleasure, which is found in spiritual knowledge, is not found in the knowledge of other things. Spiritual knowledge includes besides knowledge of God, knowledge of the reign of angels and heaven and earth. The more is the honor of the acquainted thing, the more is the taste and pleasure. A man gets great pleasure in getting the secret information of an emperor. God is the most high and the most honorable. So the pleasure gained by the pursuit of His attributes is the greatest. So the divine knowledge is the best of all kinds of knowledge. It is thus proved that the best and the highest pleasure can be obtained by the pursuit of knowledge relating to God and His. It is many times more than the pleasure gained by the sense organs (Revival of the Religious Sciences?® Fuzul-Ul-Karim's translation, p. 312). Maimonides uses the same arguments in his Introduction to Pereq He- leq. In this section I shall focus on the argument that in the world to come men will enjoy spiritual (intellectual) pleasures, the kind of plea- sures that spiritual-intellectual entities like the angels enjoy. To the sec- ond argument, which states that ordinary people also prefer spiritual and intellectual pleasures, I shall refer later, in a different section. Maimonides For we live in a material world, and the only pleasure we can comprehend must be material. But the delights of the spirit are everlasting and uninter- rupted, and there is no resemblance in any possible way between spiritual and bodily enjoyments. We are not sanctioned either by the Torah or by the 30 See A. Badawi, The Works of Al-Ghazali [Arabic], Beirut 1977, pp. 98-125. See below note 33.</page><page sequence="9">(200 1 ) Al-Ghazali and Maimonides 1 45 divine philosophers to assert that the angels, the stars, and the spheres enjoy no delights. In truth they have exceeding great delight in respect of what they comprehend of the Creator.... {Introduction, p. 38) . . . How much more will it be our case in the world of the spirit, viz. the world to come, where our souls will attain to the knowledge of the Creator as do the higher bodies [i. e. angels or the separated intellects], or more. The pleasure can not be divided into parts.31 It can not be described, neither can anything be found to compare with it. (Ibid, p. 39) 2. The Little Boy parable and The King and the Ball Game parable Side by side with the eunuch, blind and deaf metaphor, Maimonides tells a parable of a little boy, who enjoys the ball game when he is young, but after he is grown up and experiences the pleasure of the power of ruling as a king, he would never dream to trade it for the ball game. The same parable, which I call The King and the Ball Game parable is told by Al- Ghazali, in several variations. It illustrates the gradations of the believ- ers by showing that in different stages in their life, people would prefer a different kind of pleasure. The Little Boy parable of Al-Ghazali, is the skeleton of Maimonides' famous parable about the young pupil being encouraged to study by a wise teacher. In the Maimonidean version, the teacher, who is aware of the inability of a child to grasp the true value of the study, offers him different re- wards, each one of them suited to a different stage of physical and men- tal development and a different level of satisfactions, respectively. 3. Conclusions Since Maimonides' Introduction to "Pereq Heleq" includes materials that are not found in Avicenna's sayings, yet are found in Al-Ghazali's, and since Al-Ghazali's sayings in this matter include those of Avicenna's, it is reasonable to posit that the source for Maimonides' expressions in the Introduction is Al-Ghazali. To be more specific: The metaphor of the eunuch, blind and deaf, and the argument that angels enjoy pleasures and the argument that most people prefer spiritual pleasures in this world are used by Avicenna, Al-Ghazali and Maimonides. 31 Division is considered a characteristic qualification of corporeal entities.

Unlike the comparison with Avicenna, which leaves essential ques- tions unsolved, the comparison with Al-Ghazali greatly helps to clarify Maimonides' attitude concerning the other world, especially his expla- nation of the notion of the next world, in terms other than those of time. Both philosophers, Al-Ghazali and Maimonides, emphasize the second- ary value of reward and punishment in the other world, and they both condemn observation of the law, which is dominated by the desire for reward or by the fear of loss. Textual comparison: the parables A. The Little Boy parable and the gradations of pleasures The motif of the little boy, who replaces his desired pleasures of the past, with new pleasures of the present, is scattered generously in Al-Ghazali's writings. Its frequent appearance might strengthen the assumption that at least one of the versions was known to Maimonides. Since my inten- tion in this paper is to show the indebtedness of Maimonides to Al- Ghazali, I will start the comparison with him. Maimonides Now, O reader, understand the following simile of mine, and then you will make it your aim to grasp my meaning throughout. Figure to yourself a child young in years brought to a teacher to be instructed by him in the Torah. This is the greatest good he can derive in respect of his attainment of perfection. But the child on account of his fewness of his years and the weakness of his intellect, does not grasp the measure of that benefit, or the extent to which it leads him towards the attainment of perfection.... Thus he says to him "read and I shall give you nuts or figs, or a bit of sugar". The child yields to this... he gives himself up in order by its means to gain his desired object, which consists of nuts or a piece of sugar. When he grows older and his intelligence strengthens, he thinks lightly of the trifle in which he formerly found joy and begins to desire something new. He longs for this newly-chosen object of his, and his teacher now says to him, "and I shall buy you pretty shoes or a coat of this kind!" Accordingly he again exerts himself to learn, not for the sake of knowledge, but to acquire the coat.... When however he reaches a higher stage of mental perfection this prize also ranks little with him... So that when his teacher bids him ... he learns with zest in order to obtain that money, which to him is of more value than the learn-</page><page sequence="11">(2001) Al-Ghazali and Maimonides 147 ing... When, further, he reaches the age of greater discretion, this prize also loses its worth to him .... His aim is that of obtaining the honor of men, their esteem and commendation. But all these methods are blameworthy (Introduction, p. 3 1)32 Al-Ghazali And the examples of the different stages of development and their plea- sures are as we shall describe them now. When a boy is at the beginnings of his motions and perceptions [in his early childhood], an inclination for tak- ing pleasure in games and sports will appear. And for him this [present] pleasure is greater than all other things. Then, later on, shows [an inclination for] the pleasure of adornment and for wearing pretty clothes and riding horses. At that time he despises the pleasure of playing games. Then, ap- pears [the stage of] the pleasure of sexual intercourse, and the attraction to women, and he leaves all the previous pleasures for the attainment of this one. Later on appears [the stage of] the pleasures of leadership, power, and wealth; the last of the pleasures in this world, the strongest and the most exalted one. And then, after all these [stages of pleasures], appears another inclination, through which he [man] attains the pleasure of the knowledge of God, praised be He, and the knowledge of His actions. And when this appears, he despises all [the pleasures that he liked] before, since the latest of all, is the most desired of all [the strongest pleasure]. And this is the last one, because the love for the play of games shows in the years of childhood, and the love for women and for adornment in the years of maturity [young manhood], and the love for power after the twenties, and the love for sciences near the age of forty, and this one is the exalted end. And just like the boy who laughs at those who leave the game and take pleasure with women and the pursuit of power, so are the leaders who laugh at those who leave leadership and take pleasure with the knowledge of God, praised be He.

In the second stage when he is a grown up young man, he takes pleasure in cohabiting with women. In comparison with his pleasure, he thinks his pleasure of plays and sports as trifling. In the third stage, he takes pleasure in power, name and fame. In the fourth stage he is eager to have taste of spiritual pleasure, leaving all earlier pleasures behind. At that time, the people of earlier stages laugh at them as they laugh at the boys in the second stage. Spiritual knowledge in the world is less than that in the next world".

The King and The Ball Game parable In the foregoing parable, Maimonides focused on the analogy of the little boy who in his early childhood, likes sweets most of all, yet prefers the pleasure of nice clothes, fame and name when he is grown up. As the introduction continues, one comes across another version of The Little Boy parable: The King and the Ball Game parable. Maimonides When after death the worthy from among us will reach that exalted stage, he will experience no bodily pleasures, neither will he have any wish for them, any more than would a king of sovereign power wish to divest himself of his imperial sway and to return to his boyhood's games, with a ball in the street, although at one time he would without doubt have set a higher worth upon a game with a ball than on kingly dominion, such being the case only when his years were few and he was totally ignorant of the real significance of either pursuit, just as we today rank the delights of the body above those of the soul. (Introduction, p. 38) The main lesson of the parable of The King and The Ball Game is the absence of any proportionate relation between the internal, essential and noble final end, and the external, marginal and unworthy motivations to reach it. Maimonides' dependence on Al-Ghazali becomes even more striking, when the Introduction is compared with the following passage from Mi- zan al- Amai (Criterion of Action)34: Al-Ghazali And they maintained that they [Scripture or oral tradition] were forced to convey the notion of those [spiritual] pleasures in fables taken from the sen- sual pleasures known to them [the ordinary people], because they [the spiri- tual pleasures] are so far away from the mentality of the multitude.35 [The multitude behave] Just like the boy who occupies himself in study, [only] in order to achieve through it leadership or political position. Being only a child, he is not [yet] capable of grasping their pleasure, and he needs to be rewarded with rewards that he is able to enjoy, such as a chess game or a bird to entertain him, and the like. What is the pleasure of a game with a bird in comparison to the pleasure of political position and [political] power? (Mizan, p. 184, my translation).36 34 A. Badawi (above, note 30), pp. 79-81. 35 Cf.

About doubts concerning the authen-</page><page sequence="13">(2001) Al-Ghazali and Maimonides 149 It looks quite obvious that Maimonides adopted Al-Ghazali's parable about the proud king in present, despising in retrospective what he had desired most in his childhood. Al-Ghazali often repeats the idea that the status of political power is the most exalted position man can aspire to achieve, and consequently the potential for the greatest pleasure. The image of the ruler serves for both thinkers, Al-Ghazali and Maimonides. as an illustration for the mutable nature of pseudo-final goals, their childishness, and the totally inadequate proportion between the plea- sures of the past, and the pleasures of the present, although experienced by the same person. C. The eunuch metaphor combined with the parables of The little Boy and The King and The Ball Game In an additional parallel version of the king who was enchanted by the bat and the ball game in his first years of life, Al-Ghazali combines the boy metaphor with the eunuch metaphor, in order to better demonstrate the remoteness of the spiritual pleasures from the consciousness of un- tutored people. In this new nuance, the gradations of people mirror the gradations of their possessed metaphysical knowledge, and not simply the natural ranks of maturity, as we can clearly see from the opening: ...The differentiation [among the different ranks of the believers] is in accord with the width and the depth of their knowledge ("marfatihim"), which (corresponds to) the gradations in [the nearness to] Allah. Therefore, it is impossible to describe in short the differentiation of their gradations. The simile goes on to describe the gradations of pleasures: And it was already proved that the pleasure of ruling, which is an internal [pleasure/sense], is stronger in perfected people who possess all the pleasures of the senses, and that this kind of [i. e. ruling] does not exist in animals, and in young, or insane people. And [it was also shown] that in perfect people [i. e. those who do not suffer defects that might prevent them from experien- cing those pleasures], the [capacity to enjoy the] pleasure [associated with] the senses and with the passions, coexist together with the pleasure of ruling, ticity of the "Mizan", see M. A. Sherif, Ghazali's Theory of Virtue, Albany 1975, pp. 170-176, The Appendix. Cf., The Alchemy of Happiness, (trans. C. Field, revised and annotated by E. L. Daniel, New York, 1991, p. 22: "It rather means that God's greatness can immeasurably transcends our cognitive faculties, and that we can only form a very dim and imperfect idea of it. If a child asks us to explain to him the pleasure which exists in wielding sovereignty, we may say it is like the pleasure he feels in playing bat and ball, though in reality the two have nothing in common except that they come under the category of pleasure."</page><page sequence="14">150 Amira Eran JSQ8 yet people will prefer the [the pleasure of] ruling [over all the other plea- sures].37 As for the comprehension that knowledge of God, His attributes and His actions, the kingdom of His heaven, and the secrets of His sover- eignty constitute the most exalted kind of the pleasure of ruling, only those who have achieved the rank of the [pleasure of the] knowledge of Allah and the taste of it can possess it, since it is absolutely impossible to convince [in its delighted taste] those who have no heart, for the heart is the origin of this capacity [i. e. ruling in general, and the power of Allah in particular]. In the same manner, it is impossible to convince a young man of the superiority of the pleasure of sexual intercourse over the play with a bat and a ball, nor is it possible to convince an eunuch of its superiority over inhaling the violet's scent, because he has lost the faculty to feel this pleasure. Nevertheless, those who have been cured from impotence and those whose sense of smell is healthy will be able to grasp the difference between these two pleasures.... Upon my oath, if it is not true that those who engage themselves in the quest of the knowledge of divine matters, do not smell the scent of its pleasure, when they expose the problems and solve the doubts of these [metaphysical] matters, they have decisively endeavored to attain, which are rightly consid- ered [part of the] teachings and of the inquiries, even though their content is less noble than the content of the divine knowledge. (Revival, pp. 363- 364, my translation). Maimonides' choice to follow Al-Ghazali by making a "little boy" the center of his main parables implies that the failure to identify the true end of man's life and the true reward of the service of God can be remedied through devoted education and in the attainment of maturity. Conclusions 1 . The Little Boy parable and The King and the Ball Game parable are designated to illustrate and exemplify: (a) The changing nature of man-made goals, in comparison to the lasting validity and value of the true divine goal. (b) The fallacy of mistakenly desired ends being the consequence of young age only. (c) The bias given to different states, phases and cycles in man's life on his ladder of priorities. 2. Both Al-Ghazali and Maimonides talk about stages of mental and physical development. The only noteworthy detail is the omission of sexual pleasure from Maimonides' parables, most probably because it does not fit the frame of teacher-student relations. 37 Which proves the superiority of spiritual pleasures over the corporeal ones.</page><page sequence="15">(2001) Al-Ghazali and Maimonides 1 5 1 3. They both point to the fact that the material pleasures are temporary, and people tend to laugh at their desires in previous stages. 4. Both thinkers see self-realization and reaching true understanding as part of a natural evolution. They both give weight to guidance and external assistance. 5. Both thinkers agree on the superiority of metaphysical knowledge, yet while Al-Ghazali sees it as the highest rung on the ladder of pleasures, Maimonides conceives it as the only end for itself. Textual comparison: views 1. The natural gradations of pleasures in man's physical-sensual realm The following textual comparison provides an additional proof for the impact of Al-Ghazali on Maimonides. The most remarkable common argument used by both Al-Ghazali and Maimonides in this section is the superiority of spiritual pleasures over the carnal delights in this world too. Although this argument is one of the two arguments used by Avicenna as well, the Al-Ghazalian- Maimonidean version is but a poor shadow of its hypothetical origin.38 It should be remarked that the analogy between the high value attached to spiritual pleasures experi- enced in this world, and the high value of spiritual pleasures in general, ought not be taken as a necessary deduction of Avicenna's metaphor of the eunuch, the blind and the deaf (nor should it be seen as a technical extrapolation of his remark that the delights of the spiritual entities are more intense, due to their closeness to God). Maimonides And when you give your consideration to the subject of these two plea- sures, you will discover the meanness of the one and the high worth of the other. And this applies even to this world. For we find that in the case of the majority of men that they all burden their souls and bodies with the greatest possible labor and fatigue in order to attain distinction or a great position in men's esteem. This pleasure is not that of eating and drinking. Similarly, many a man prefers the obtaining of revenge over his enemies to many of the pleasures of the body. And many a man, again, shuns the greatest among all physical delights out of fear it should bring him shame and the reproach of men, or because he seeks a good reputation. {Introduction, p. 38-39) 38 See supra, page 5 and note 21.</page><page sequence="16">152 Amira Eran JSQ 8 Al-Ghazali The inclination of man to [the preference of the] intellectual pleasures, and the avoidance of intellectual pain is stronger [than the preference to corporeal pleasures] in this world too.39 For people prefer to conquer their sexual impulses in order not to hurt their reputation, and they are ready to suffer pain and troubles [for the attainment of such abstracted purpose]. Man often chooses to abandon eating for a day or two, in order to enjoy the pleasure of winning a dice game, despite its inferiority; and [again] vic- tory is an intellectual pleasure. One is also ready to endanger his life and fight alone against many warriors, in order to achieve fame and publicity and to be known as a hero. They also claimed that the sensual pleasures in comparison to those extant in the other world are exceedingly imperfect. The relation between them [the pleasures in this world] to the pleasures in the other world is like the relation of the smell of food to its taste,40 or like the relation between the thought about the face of the beloved one to the meeting with her; it is increased many fold. (Mizan, pp. 183-4, my transla- tion) In the Revival of the Religious Sciences, Al-Ghazali outlines the grada- tions of pleasures, in correspondence with the gradations of man's chronological development. The preference of most pleasures to others is explained as a natural fact. Pleasure differs in respect of difference of objects. For instance there is difference in the pleasure of cohabitation and songs. Then again there is difference in the cohabitation of a young man and that of an old man. Again pleasure is of two kinds, external pleasure gained by the five sense organs and internal pleasure as power, victory, honor which are outside the pleasure of five sense organs. It is also true that one likes power of rule more than delicious foods, but a boy will certainly like delicious foods more than power of rule. Similarly the pleasure of spiritual knowledge of God and search of his attributes are more to some man than the pleasure of power of rule. {Revival, Fuzul Ul-Karim's translation, p. 312). 39 In Al-Ghazali's view the superiority of knowledge to the physical needs of the body is absolute, and it is justified by two arguments: 1. The pleasure of the body emphasizes the common virtues to man and animals; 2. The pleasure of food and sex should not considered absolute, since it is used to remove pain. (Which I understand as an inherent temporary faculty, which when satisfied, man is relaxed, while spiritual pleasure has no internal point of satiety).

The metaphor of love for a woman (1) The metaphor of love for a woman and The Little Boy parable Both thinkers see the pleasure of love as the highest stage of closeness to God and they both compare it to love for a woman. Much has been said about the mystic nuance of Maimonides' highest expression of love in Guide 3:51,41 and in Laws of Repentance. It seems to me that Al-Ghaza- li' s description of the yearning for the meeting with God in the image of a passionate overall desire to meet the beloved, has inspired Maimo- nides' choice to symbolize the worshipping of God out of love through the metaphor of the uncontrolled love taken from the Song of Songs. Maimonides What is the love of God that is befitting? It is to love the eternal with great and exceeding love.... like a love-sick individual whose mind is at no time free from his passion for a particular woman, the thought of her filling his heart at all times.... Even intenser should be the love of God in the hearts of those who love Him (Laws of Repentance, 10:3, Hyamson' transla- tion, p. 92b)42 Al-Ghazali Moreover, despite its perfection, there is no relation whatsoever between that pleasure [the knowledge of God in this world] to the pleasure of seeing Him and meeting with Him [in the other world], as there is no relation at all, between the pleasure of imagining the face of the beloved one and the plea- sure of seeing her, and there is no relation between the pleasure of inhaling the smell of delicious foods, and tasting them, and between the pleasure of touching the hand [of the beloved] and making love. (Revival, p. 380, my translation).43 41 See Guide (above, note 11), p. 627. Cf. Sh. Pines, "The Philosophical Purport of Maimonides' Halachic Works and the Purport of the Guide of the Perplexed", in: Y. Yoval and Sh. Pines (eds.), Maimonides and Philosophy, Dordrecht 1986, p. 9. See Stroumsa (above note 3), pp. 73-75, H. Davidson. "Maimonides on Metaphysical Knowledge", Maimonidean Studies 3 (1992/3), p. 98. 42 Jerusalem 1962. Although the term "Hesheq" is absent here, it fully fits with the sense of passionate love for a particular woman, which is used by Maimonides - fol- lowing the pattern of the Song of Songs - to illustrate a state of love which exceeds all bounds. See W. Z. Harvey, Physics and Metaphysics in Hasday Cresças, Amsterdam 1998, pp. 101-104, 11-113, 123-125. See also S. Harvey, "The Meaning of Terms Des- ignating Love in Judeo-Arabic Thought and Some Remarks on the Judeo-Arabic Inter- pretation of Maimonides", in: Judeo-Arabic Studies, ed. N.

The Gnostics feel</page><page sequence="18">154 Amira Eran JSQS Al-Ghazali describes two unequal phases: the seeing of the beloved be- hind a curtain or a veil, compared to looking at her in full light; and meeting with the beloved when still imprisoned in the chains of carnal satisfactions, compared to the meeting with her, freed from the oppres- sion of those wants. These two phases belong to the divine realm and they illustrate the difference between speculation and affection as ways to attaining the nearness of God. The possibility of Al-Ghazali's direct influence in this case, too, be- comes more likely if we take into account that the metaphor of the attrac- tion to the beloved woman is included in some variations of the "eunuch metaphor" and is part of the repeated statement of no proportion be- tween the pleasures of this world and the pleasures of the otherworld. Now, near the end of the cycle of life, Al-Ghazali is willing to uncover the poetic veil of The Little Boy parable: . . . And love is a metaphor for the imperfection [incapability] of the soul and its inability to long for the exalted sphere, and for its occupation with the lowest of all; this is the metaphor for the boy's incapability to attain the pleasure of power and for his [preference for the] occupation with the play- ful game with the bird {Revival, p. 382, my translation).44 The metaphor of a young boy, who in his early childhood prefers the pleasure of the game, yet despises the very same pleasure when he is grown up (and becomes a king according to some variations of this metaphor), illustrates here, near the summit of human felicity, the hier- archy between the pleasure of facing God, and the pleasure of only knowing His attributes. The reader who followed Al-Ghazali's grada- tions carefully, finds out that any desired pleasure dims to the beholder as a final end, just as in the case with the little boy. Gradations - so it seems - exist even in the longed for realm of divinity. immense pleasure in Marfat, but it is not to be compared with the pleasure to be gained by direct sight in the next world. The pleasure in thoughts of the beloved is hundred times less than that of direct sight, and the pleasure of hand touch is thousands times less than that gained by cohabitation. There is a great deal of difference between the two". 44 Cf. ibid., pp. 379, 384. In The Alchemy (above, note 36), Al-Ghazali is more clear in the identification of the knowledge of God with His love, and in seeing both as the greatest happiness, and greatest pleasure ("enjoyment", according to the Alchemy's English trans.): "He who supposes that it is possible to enjoy happiness in the next world apart from the love of God is far gone in error, for the very essence of future life is to arrive at God as at an object of desire long aimed at and attained through countless obstacles. The enjoyment of God is happiness. But if he had no delight in God before, he will not delight in Him then... In brief, our future happiness will be in strict proportions to the degree in which we have loved God here" (Alchemy, p. 88).</page><page sequence="19">(2001) Al-Ghazali and Maimonides 1 55 Maimonides also believes that the level of the divine is beyond any relations with the level of man. According to his theory, too, the eternal entities do not form equal or reciprocal relations with man, as might be inferred from the analogy to the story of love in the Song of Songs, or from the sense of free will associated with irrational or unconditional love.45 (2) Love and knowledge of God It seems to me that Maimonides is responding to Al-Ghazali's expres- sions, such as "And in the same manner, you ought to see the relation between the pleasure of seeing God to the pleasure of knowing Him", when he is describing the relations between love and knowledge of God as dependent on each other. Maimonides According to the knowledge [of God] will be the love [to God] (Laws of Repentance, 10:6, Hyamson's translation, p. 93a) Maimonides points to the mutual relations between love and knowledge, as the sought for formula to win the twofold spiritual reward: If the former [love] be little or much, so will the latter [knowledge] be little or much (ibid.). The influence of Al-Ghazali is best demonstrated in the following pas- sage, where the outhor states that "The measure of the love to God is in the measure of the knowledge of Him, may he be exalted".46 It also proves the erotic meanning Al-Ghazali and Maimonides ascribe to the love for God. Al-Ghazali Just as the manifold pleasures of the lover increase when the fantasy about her is replaced with the seeing of her real figure, since this is his ut- most pleasure. . . . Thus the bliss of the Garden is in the measure of the love to God, and the measure of the Love to God is in the measure of the knowl- 45 See W. Z. Harvey, "Albo on Reasonlessness of True Love", lyyun, V. 49 (Jerusa- lem, 2000), p. 83-86. I wish to thank Prof. A. Shapira for drawing my attention to this article. 46 B. Abrahamov has indicated that attaining knowledge of the highest truth through mystical experience is nearly impossible with no prior study. To the great majority of people, it is recommended to study before they are engaged in mysticism. See id., "Al-Ghazali's supreme way to know God", Studia Islamica 11 (1993), pp. 141- 168, pp. 150-153, esp., note 45 on p. 150.</page><page sequence="20">156 Amira Eran JSQ% edge of Him, may he be exalted,47 and the basis for all happiness is knowl- edge, that which religion calls faith. {Revival, p. 379, my translation).48 In the exalted level, when man is beyond the conquering passions of corporeality, pure knowledge can no longer satiate the thirst for the supra-sensual, yet truly felt, meeting with God.49 And look in how great measure pleasure increases now, till no relation is left to be measured between it and the previous ones [it is being so much greater]. And in the same manner, you ought to see the relation between the pleasure of seeing God to the pleasure of knowing Him.50 {Revival, p. 382, my translation). (3) The close relation between this world and the otherworld As we have seen in the previous section, Al-Ghazali conceives the spiri- tual pleasure as the highest stage in the ladder of pleasures rooted in this world. By the same token he conceives the next world as a culmination of a self-development process that begins in this world. This concept that the next world is a state of the mind, which is not dependent upon the death of the body, appears also in Maimonides' definition of "ha-'Olam ha-Ba'". Maimonides It is called the World to Come only becouse human beings will enter into it at a time subsequent to the life of the present world in which we now exist 47 See ibid., p. 156. 48 The proximity between knowledge and love is well demonstrated in the following utterance: "This knowledge is necessary as without this knowledge there can be no love and for this reason the fools can not love God" {Revival, trans. Fuzul Ul-Karim, pp. 304-305). Cf. ibid, p. 324: "The gnostics are the nearest to God.... The more a man searches after His glory, the more his love for him". 49 In his introduction to Al-Ghazali 's Book of Fear and Hope (above note 3), W. McKane, the translator of the book, writes "... There is the implicit contrast between knowledge or science Cilm) and the knowledge or gnosis (ma'rifa). The first is defective and dangerous mode of apprehending God, the second is self-authenticating insight . . . and only the God of love and intimacy can succeed 'knowledge' ... (ibid., p. xvii) 50 Cf. The Alchemy (above, note 36), p. 22: "Thus the exclamation, 'God is great' means that his greatness far exceeds all our powers of comprehension. Moreover, such imperfect knowledge of God, as we can attain to it, is not a mere speculative knowl- edge, but must be accompanied by a devotion and worship. When a man dies he has to do with God alone, and if we have to live with a person, our happiness entirely depends on the degree of affection we feel towards him. Love is a seed of happiness, and love of God is fostered and developed by worship".</page><page sequence="21">(200 1 ) Al-Ghazali and Maimonides 1 57 with body and soul - and this existence comes first. (Laws of Repentance, 8:8, Hyamson's translation, p. 91a).51 Maimonides sees the attainment of happiness in the world to come as a natural process, which fully depends on the devotion to God and the depth of love-knowledge for Him demonstrated during life in this world. So you will enjoy both worlds - a happy life on earth leading to the life in the World to Come. For if wisdom is not acquired and good deeds are not performed here, there will be naught meriting a recompense hereafter. (Laws of Repentance, 9:1, Hyamson's translation, p. 92a) His above-mentioned concept of two phases of spiritual pleasures, knowledge of God in this world,52 and seeing God in the other world, led Al-Ghazali to describe the other world as a direct outcome of life in this world.53 Al-Ghazali And whoever failed to know God in this world, will never know Him in the other world, and whoever failed to find the pleasure of the knowledge of God in this world, will never find the pleasure of seeing God in the other world, since nothing in the other world will continue unless it has started in this world. (Revival, p. 379; my translation).54 The perception of the other world as perfection of the intellectual attain- ments in this world goes hand in hand with the existence of a conflictual tension between the two worlds. The love for this world and its proper- 51 Cf. Mizan (above, note 36), p. 292: "... And Death is another stage of the stages [of life]... And it is another kind of [the time of] childhood, and of the transition from one world to the other... "(my translation). Cf. Ibid, Ihya (Fuzul Ul-Karim's transla- tion), p. 314: "For this reason Abu Sulaiman said: 'He who is today busy with himself, will also be tomorrow with himself. He who is busy with the Lord today will be also tomorrow with the Lord". 52 Although knowledge is not the highest achievement of man, and above it, there stands the stage of the overall love to God, which excludes all other love, knowledge is a necessary stage, needed to assure the immortality of the rational soul. See, e. g., The Alchemy (above, note 36), p. 34: "Such is the death of the animal soul. With the spiri- tual or human soul, the case is different. It is indivisible and by it man knows God. It is so to speak, the rider of the animal soul, and when that perishes, it still remains . . . But alas for that soul which loses its steed and hunting weapons before it has captured the prize! Its misery and regret will be indiscernible". 53 Cf. Mizan (above, note 36), p. 268, and also note 63 above. 54 Cf. also Fuzul Ul-Karim's English translation, pp. 317-318: "Knowledge of Mar- fat is a seed of next world sight. The seed grows into a tree and the tree gives fruits. He who does not sow seeds cannot expect fruits ... He who did not recognize God in the world will not be blessed with his vision in the next world.... A man will be resurrected upon the condition in which he lived in this world . . . How can he who is free of Marfat realize that pleasure? The Gnostics feel immense pleasure in Marfat, but it is not to be compared with the pleasure to be gained by direct sight in the next world".</page><page sequence="22">158 Amira Eran JSQÜ ties, such as wealth, family and friends, is the main obstacle that weak- ens the love to the world to come. Thus, the intensity of the love of God is in indirect proportion to the intensity of the ties with the pleasures of this world.55 In concluding this section, I would like to remark that despite the essential affinity between Al-Ghazali and Maimonides, it should be ac- knowledged that the search for the nearness of God does not spring from the same source in both of them. The sense of love, which is the main moving force beyond the yearning of man to transcend his bodily limits and partake in the divine, is affected differently by the passion to merge with God, which is characteristic of the mystical inclination of Al- Ghazali, and by the quest of the intellect to recognize itself in the form of the active intellect imprinted on him and pulling him towards the aspired conjunction with the divine, which is characteristic of the ra- tional tendency of Maimonides. Yet, Aristotelianism in general, and Aristotelianism that was mistakenly and deliberately affected by Neo- Platonic trends in particular - like medieval Arabic Aristotelianism - is subject to the impact of the inevitable mystical implications of man's basic desire to abolish all limits between the object of contempla- tion, the contemplative subject and contemplation itself. This desire, when it exceeds the boundaries of the recognizing self, molds the other- worldly spirituality in the likeness and nearness of God, whether it is interpreted in terms of intellectuality common to man and God, or in terms of exalted indescribable sensuality. 55 Cf. The Alchemy (above, note 36), p. 37: "on the other hand, the pains which souls suffer after death all have their source in the excessive love of the world. ... They [simple-minded people] do not understand that these snakes have their abode within the unbeliever's spirit ... for they were his own evil qualities symbolized, such as jea- lousy, hatred, hypocrisy, pride, deceit, etc., every one of which springs, directly or re- motely, from love of the world." Cf. Risala fi 'I Nafs: "Thereupon, as the seer increases in perspicuity, his capacity for happiness will increase proportionately. It is though man will not be freed from attachment to this (lower) world and its cares unless his relation to that (higher) world has been firmly established, and he has acquired a yearning for what exists yonder and a passion strong enough to prevent him from looking back at what he has left behind" (In: M. Fakhry, Ethical theories (above, note 21), Appendix B, p. 218). Cf., Tahafut al-Falasifah (above note 2), p. 233: "If these conditions are satis- fied, then, while it is yet in this world, its connection with worldly things will be cut off, whereas the connection with things of the Hereafter will grow stronger. So when death comes, the soul will experience the same relief as a prisoner does when he is set free. And then it will find every thing it could have sought. That is its Paradise".</page><page sequence="23">(2001) Al-Ghazali and Maimonides 1 59 3. Although no man has seen the spiritual pleasure of the hereafter, it is true happiness and the only true reward The locus of otherworldliness is the sense of spirituality ascribed to it. It moves Al-Ghazali and Maimonides to see intellectuality as the main characteristic of the divine and to cling to the literal interpretations of expressions, such as "No eye has seen" (that promised happiness of the other world). Maimonides (A) When after death the worthy from among us will reach that exalted stage, he will experience no bodily pleasures, neither he will have any wish for them {Introduction, p. 38) (B) The ultimate and perfect reward, the final bliss which will suffer neither interruption nor diminution is the life in the world to come {Laws of Repentance, 9:2, Hyamson's translation, p. 92a) (C) But as for the bliss in the world to come, naught can be compared with, or likened to it. ... That is the bliss which neither the eye of the proph- et, nor any one else but God, hath seen, He hath prepared for the man who waits for Him. (Ibid., 8:7, p. 91a). Al-Ghazali (A) God says: Nobody knows that pleasure pleasing to the eyes lies in store for him. The prophet said: 'God prepared for the righteous servants such happiness as no eye has seen, no ear has heard and no heart of man has conceived'. But now he will not understand it.... He will one day have to give up the earthly pleasures by the event of death. {Revival, p. 313) (B) So the intellectual pleasures in the Hereafter will be far superior to the sensuous pleasures of this world. But for this fact, the prophet (may God bless him and grant him peace) would not have reported God to say: "I have reserved for My virtuous worshippers what no eye ever saw, no ear ever heard and which never accrued to the heart of man." And says God (exalted be He): "No soul knows what comfort of the eye lies concealed in the store for them." {Tahafut al-Falasifah, Kamali's translation, p. 231-232) (C) The taste of appreciation of beauty has been explained by the proph- et in the following Hadis. God says: I have prepared for my righteous servants such rewards no eye hath seen, no ear hath heard and no heart of man hath convinced. If the soul of any man can be turned completely, he can get some taste in this world {Revival, Fuzul Ul-Karim's translation, p. 315) Both thinkers claim that the highest rank of delights awaiting man in the other world is beyond human comprehension. The vague character of the reward in the world to come is not merely a direct result of its</page><page sequence="24">160 Amira Eran JSQ 8 indescribable taste of joy, but also an expected expression of its spiri- tuality and exclusiveness. The abstracted quality of incorporeal things (that by definition are not meant to be sensed by the eye or the ear), and the subtlety of the unconditioned reward, being an integral part of the utmost perfection of man (which leaves one with no extra prize in his hand), contribute to the elusive sense of the spiritual reward. The ab- stracted notion of its existence may easily identified with non-exis- tence.56 From this perspective, the other world might be rightly per- ceived as the continuation of this world, since it is part of it, just as the outcome is part of a prior chain of events, and the effect is a part of the cause, and the conclusion is part of the beginning. Both thinkers treat the motif of complete surprise expressed by the Holy writings as if it were solid information regarding the essential nature of the future reward. 4. Spiritual pleasures and the unconditional belief in God Maimonides' approach toward the worship of God out of fear is very close to Al-Ghazali's attitude toward pedagogical and political consid- erations.57 Their intention in the "little boy" parable is to call attention to the fact that people fail to understand the true nature of the world to come, and that they mistakenly substitute it for such and such a reward. As Maimonides puts it: "But with regard to this strange point - I mean the world to come - you will find very few who will in any way take the matter to heart ... or ask to what these names (the world to come) refer . . . And you will rarely come across any one who will distinguish between the end desired and the means which lead to it".58 56 See, e. g., the strict philosophical demands which constitute the preconditions for such lofty kinds of knowledge that Avicenna enumerates in his Risala fi 'I Nafs: "(a) apprehending the immaterial principles.... (b) apprehending the final causes of those matters.... (c) comprehending the form of the Whole and the relation of its parts to one another..., (d) conceiving Providence, its order and modality..., (e) ascertaining what type of being belongs to that Entity..., (f) realizing how other existing entities are ar- ranged in relation to it", in: Ethical Theories (above note 21), p. 218. 57 In religious Aristotelian doctrines, moral considerations are part of political thought, especially in Muslim or Jewish society, where there is no difference between the civil law and the divine law. On the educational aspects in the "Introduction", see E. Schweid [Hebrew], "Mi-talmid le-rav" (Analysis of the literal structure of the Intro- duction to 'Heleq'), in: A. Ravitzki (ed.), From Rome to Jerusalem [Hebrew], Jerusalem 1998, pp. 18-23. DO Maimonides Introduction (above, note y), p. JU.</page><page sequence="25">(2001) Al-Ghazali and Maimonides 161 In his Revival of the Religious Sciences, and in his Criterion of Ac- tion,59 Al-Ghazali speaks of three different types of believers, who differ in their motivation to obey the Law and to observe the commandments. The people who inhabit the lowest level constitute the type that needs immediate gratification, and are, therefore, interested in the satisfactions of the body, such as good food, good drink and good sex. Those people believe that they will continue to enjoy such pleasures in the world to come, and even double them, and therefore stick passionately to the literal reading of their Qur'anic detailed descriptions. They are not cap- able of abstraction, neither of the direct experience of the pleasures of the body, nor of the direct meaning of the holy text. The highest rank is comprised of believers who are capable of under- standing the lawfulness of reality as manifested in the laws of nature and in divine Law. The individuals, who belong to this rare and elitist arche- type, are not motivated by external and material rewards. They observe the Law because it is the best way to act in divine metaphysical reality, where every being has an end ordained by God. In the middle, between these two extremes, there exists a class of moderate people, who do not possess the sublime belief, yet are not dominated by external satisfactions only. The very fact that there is a mid-way, demonstrates a tolerant view of Al-Ghazali, who seems to believe that every one is entitled to be happy and can attain true knowl- edge of God through guidance and study. Maimonides too, portrays profiles of three types of believers, which form three levels of attitude to the observance of the Law. According to the Maimonidean scale, the pretending "philosophers" are located at one extreme and the simple believers, at the opposite extreme. The dis- tance between the two extremes is dependent upon the willingness to examine the logical validity of the divine contents.60 59 See mizan (above, note 36), esp. pp. 287-293. 60 It should be noted that in many occasions in his writings, Al-Ghazali condemns the blind believers who lean exclusively on traditional oral and written texts and their literal interpretations ("taqlid"). According to his view, "Taqlid" is the lowest way to reach the nearness of God. See, e. g., Mizan, (above, note 36), pp. 192, 195, 334, esp. p. 339. Cf. B. Abrahamov (above, note 47), p. 145; Cf. H. Lazarus Yafeh, Studies in Al-Ghazali, Jerusalem, 1975, pp. 488-502. On the other hand, Al-Ghazali's critique of the scientific experts is no less sharp. See e. g., The Alchemy (above, note 36), p. 21: "The doctor, physicist, and astrologer are doubtless right each in his particular branch of knowledge, but they do not see that illness is, so to speak, a cord of love by which God draws to Himself the saints...". Al-Ghazali, like Maimonides, emphasizes that the number of genuine seekers of God is very small, in comparison to the large number of the false philosophers. See Ethical Theories (above, note 21), 204 ff.</page><page sequence="26">162 Amira Eran JSQ 8 Maimonides The members of this [low] class adopt the words of the sages literally, and give no kind of interpretation whatsoever. With them all impossibilities are necessary occurrences. This owing to their being ignorant in science and far away from knowledge (Maimonides, Introduction, p. 34) The true opinion appears to be a rare compromise between the intellec- tual demands and the words of Scripture: The third class of thinkers is (as God liveth) so very small . . . They never- theless indicate the perfection of their authors and the fact that they attained truth. The members of this class are convinced also of the impossibility of the impossible and the necessary existence of what must exist {Ibid., p. 36). The true philosophers, the members of the third group, criticize the conditional performance of the commandments by the lower classes. They mock the absurdity of the belief that the true final good serves as an instrument for a greater value, all the more so when that hoped- for "good" is measured in material terms, which are associated with the passing, transient joys of the body. When Al-Ghazali describes the noble belief that the top class of peo- ple should adhere to, he characterizes it as a belief that is not condi- tional at all. It is utterly free from the expectations to inherit paradise or escape hell. This uncommon kind of total commitment to the true and the right for their own sake, he ascribes to the Sufis. Al-Ghazali At this utmost degree the wise men of the Sufis have proclaimed, with no fear: whosoever worships Allah for the sake of the Garden, or for the refrain of Hell, is impious (Mizan, p. 185, my translation). Maimonides also indicates that the most desired attitude towards God is a belief that is in no way affected by the goal to win paradise:61 61 Perhaps it is possible to see in the figure of Abraham as the model of the highest philosophical faith, Maimonides' response to Al-Ghazali's portrayal of him. Al-Ghazali ascribes to Abraham the scientists' greatest mistake: the inability to see the whole. Whereas Maimonides describes Abraham as a true philosopher, whose attitude to God formed his love to Him, and his love for Him was a direct outcome of his recogni- tion of the lawfulness of the universe, Al-Ghazali sees Abraham as a man of confined knowledge, who does not discern between the laws of nature and the powers of nature. Whereas Maimonides believes that the worship of God demonstrated by Abraham is strong enough to establish faith on the basis of rational argumentation only, Al-Ghazali has suggested that the faith of Abraham is a manifestation of idolatrous conditional belief, which depends fully on immediate material satisfactions. Whereas Maimonides sees Abraham as the one who saved humanity from assigning independent activity and autonomous power to intermediaries, like the stars and the moon, Al-Ghazali has at-</page><page sequence="27">(2001) Al-Ghazali and Maimonides 163 The perfect man must not say: "if I perform these virtues, and refrain from these vices which God forbade, what reward shall I receive?" {Introduc- tion, p. 32) 5. The denial of physical resurrection of the bodies As has been stated before, the notion of the otherworld is displayed by Al-Ghazali as a bone of contention between the philosophers in general, and the adherents of religion, and of Islam, in particular. At the conclu- sion of his book, Tahafut al-Falasifah (Incoherence of the Philosophers), aiming at the refutation of the most well-known doctrines of the philo- sophers, Al-Ghazali notes the refusal to admit the possibility of the resurrection of the dead,62 resulting in the substitution of paradise and hell with abstract rewards and punishments as one of the greatest errors of the philosophers. Al-Ghazali describes the philosophers as those who deny any physical aspects of the next world. All corporeality is denied categorically: no sensual existence of a body, no particular location for paradise and hell, and no emotional feelings of pleasure and pain: (Problem xx) Refutation of their denial of the resurrection of bodies. They deny the return of the souls to bodies: the existence of a physical Paradise and Hell. {Tahafut, Kamali's translation, p. 229)63 Later on, when Ibn Rushd is responding to Al-Ghazali's massive attack on the philosophers, he points to its definitive implications: no indivi- dual immortality, no corporeal resurrection, no corporeal pleasure and punishment. tributed to Abraham precisely this fallacy: "So the physicist and astronomer confound the laws they perceive with the Lawgiver. A similar mistake is attributed to Abraham in the Koran, where it is related that he turned successively to the stars, moon and sun as the objects of his worship, till grown aware of Him who had made all these, he ex- claimed "I love not them that set" [Qur'an, 6:76], The Alchemy (above, note 36), p. 20. It seems quite possible that Maimonides' choice to present Abraham as the only true lover of God is a direct answer to Ghazali's charges. See, e. g., "It was in this that the pre-eminence of Abraham our father consisted, He was a server from motives of pure love", Introduction (above, note 9), p. 33. See also Laws of Idolatry 1:3. Cf. Abrahamov (above, note 47), p. 161; H. Kreisel, Maimonides' Political Thought, New York 1999, pp. 29-36; D. Hartman, Maimonides: Torah and Philosophic Quest, Philadelphia 1976, Chapter 5. 62 See Tahafut al-Falasifah (above note 2), pp. 354-355, 376-377. Cf., Kamal's trans- lation, p. 249. In a less poignant tone, Al-Ghazali describes the dispute between philo- sophy and religion as revolving around the possibility of combining physical and spiri- tual mode of experience after death, See ibid, pp. 234-235. 63 Cf. ibid, pp. 236-237.</page><page sequence="28">164 Amira Eran JSQ 8 What Ghazali says against them is right, and in refuting them it must be admitted that the soul is immortal, as is proved by rational and religious proofs, and it must be assumed that what arises from the dead is simulacra of these earthly bodies, not these bodies themselves, for that which has perished does not return individually and a thing can only return as an image of that which has perished, not as being identical with what has perished as Ghazali declares. Therefore the doctrine of resurrection of those theologians who believe that the soul is an accident and that the bodies which arise are identical with those that perished can not be true . . . (Ibn Rushd, Thafut al-Thafut, van der Bergh's translation, p. 362). It would be rather naive to suspect Ibn Rushd of being fooled by Al- Ghazali's hesitating voice. Yet, despite his previous honesty in the con- veyance of Al-Ghazali's rendering of the philosophers' doctrines, Ibn Rushd now takes precautions before he dares to proclaim openly the full consequences of the above-mentioned views. Those who are in doubt about this and object to it and try to explain it are those who seek to destroy the religious prescriptions and to undo the virtues. They are, as every one knows, the heretics and those who believe that the end of man consists only in sensual enjoyments . . . What Ghazali says against them is right, and in refuting them it must be admitted that the soul is immortal, as is proved by rational and religious proofs (ibid.). In the light of his critique, it is somehow relaxing to discover that Ibn Rushd, in the conclusion of his book, finds support in the very same teachings of Al-Ghazali. Ghazali asserts in this book that no Muslim believes in a purely spiritual resurrection and in another book he says that the Sufis hold it. According to this latter assertion those who believe in a spiritual but not in a perceptible resurrection are not declared heretics by universal consent, and this permits belief in a spiritual resurrection ... (ibid.) Perhaps it is the vague distinction between perceptual resurrection and a spiritual resurrection, that leaves enough room for a restrained theolo- gian, who believes that intimacy with God cannot be reached without prior knowledge, like Al-Ghazali, and for a rational philosopher, who asks more than subtle knowledge of the truth, like Maimonides, to fos- ter a theory of spiritual pleasures experienced by an ever extant soul. Perhaps it is Al-Ghazali, who despite his explicit declarations, was known in the narrow circles of religious philosophers, or rational theo- logians for his semi-philosophical position regarding the spiritual de- lights of the otherworld. In any case, Ibn Rushd is not the first one to choose Al-Ghazali, the most bitter enemy of the philosophers, as their defender in their fight against the attractive belief in sensual joy and terror after death.</page><page sequence="29">(2001) Al-Ghazali and Maimonides 165 I have pointed to some of the similarities in language and in views between Al-Ghazali and Maimonides. These similarities were already observed in Maimonides' day, as evidenced from the epistle of Rabbi Sheshet to the scholars of Lunel, and to R. Jonathan ha-Cohen, the head of the congregation of Lunel. The respected Rabbi, who is reacting to the attack of R. Meir Abulafia, in which he accused Maimonides of denying of resurrection of the dead, points to the similarity between Maimonides and Al-Ghazali in their theory of the otherworld.64 Rabbi Sheshet calls for rescuing Maimonides from the hands of the naive believers in the traditional version of the resurrection of the dead, by using Al-Ghazali as a weapon. The greatest attacker of the philoso- phers is chosen to refute the popular belief in carnal satisfactions in the world to come, including the revival of the bodies! Conclusions The textual comparison proves the dependence of Maimonides on Al- Ghazali. 1 . It shows that both thinkers use The Little Boy parable and The King and The Ball Game parable to describe the gap between the worthy pleasures and the desired ones on all levels of reality and in both worlds, this world and the world to come. 2. These two parables, are rooted in the discussion of the nature and significance of the other world and reflect the different approaches to the exact meaning of the holy text. 3. The discussion reveals Al-Ghazali and Maimonides' common view regarding the gradations of worshipping God.65 The inability to iden- 64 H. A. Wolfson has identified the great scholar referred to in the epistle with Al- Ghazali. The views in favor of spiritual resurrection, in the form of the immortality of the wise soul, are ascribed by the reported philosopher (i. e., Al-Ghazali) to the Sufis. A. Marx, following Wolfson's identification has pointed to the Hebrew version of the Mizan as the possible source, yet the similarity to the Arabic version is much clearer, and no doubt was known to R. Sheshet. (See Mizan, p. 196: "And I have already heard that one of the respected adherents of the Sufis is proclaiming that who goes to Allah sees the Garden while he is [still] in this world, and while the most exalted Paradise is in his heart ...", my translation). Cf., note 45 above. See A. Marx, "Texts by and about Maimonides", JQR 25, (1934-5), Philadelphia; p. 410, Hebrew text, p. 422, and esp. p. 425. 1 wish to thank Prof. G. Freudenthal for drawing my attention to this article and for his generous assistance. 65 In his above-mentioned research (above, note 47), Abrahamov shows convin- cingly that the concept of gradations of knowledge is essential for Al-Ghazali and appears in many of his writings. See ibid., pp. 143, 144, 145, 148.</page><page sequence="30">166 Amira Eran JSQ 8 tify the true end of man's life, is the reflection of the inability to discern between absolute lasting values and temporary rewards which suit the immediate needs. 4. Although Avicenna in his metaphor of the eunuch, the blind and the deaf, is the first to express the argument about the superiority of the spiritual and intellectual pleasures over the sensual ones already in this world, Al-Ghazali's contribution to Maimonides' parable of The Little Boy is clearly seen in the nuances he adds to this basic meta- phor. The changes that Al-Ghazali makes in the main picture; such as the hierarchy of pleasures within a specific capacity of the senses (taste, smell, touch), the examples chosen to illustrate the relativism of those lofty pleasures, and the order of spiritual pleasures in accord with intellectual achievements; form an essential revision of the Avi- cennean original. 5. Both thinkers hold that the preference of spiritual pleasures does not derive from discernible positive moral virtues. Rather, the bodily pleasures are tossed aside in the name of a negative, or a semi-nega- tive motivation, such as the passion for fame, revenge, or the fear of shame, which in turn are condemned by the true intellectual love- seeker of God. 6. Both thinkers - although belonging to different schools, or at least so characterized - display in the center of their theory a concept of love which combines affection with devotion, and pleasure with attrac- tion. The comparison to Al-Ghazali proves how much closer Maimo- nides is to that Sufic-mystic love, than is generally presumed.66 7. The notion of love, which lies in the center of Al-Ghazali's and Mai- monides' concepts, is of a love, which does not despise pleasure, is not detached from the body and does not demand constant sacrifice. 8. This concept of love does not differentiate between instrumental, temporary goals and the final everlasting end. It acknowledges only one' real value: the love of God, a love that combines both the way to reach true spiritual happiness and the attainment of this happiness. 66 For the possibility of a Sufic inclination, See, e. g., W. Z. Harvey, "Cresças versus Maimonides on Knowledge," in: R. Link-Salinger et al., eds., A Straight Path: Studies in Medieval Philosophy and Culture in Honor of A. Hyman, Washington, 1988, pp. 113- 123, esp. 122-123; cf. ibid., Physics and Metaphysics (above note 43), pp. 99-102; S. Harvey, "The Meaning of Terms Designating Love" (above note 43), pp. 187-188.</page></plain_text>
