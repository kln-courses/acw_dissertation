<plain_text><page sequence="1">XLII AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ESTHETICS OF LITERARY PORTRAITURE DESPITE the myriad studies of literature in print, a comprehensive aesthetics of literary portraiture remains still unavailable. In the following mere introduction to the subject I propose to state a principle whereby to explain the beauty of fictional personages; to devote atten- tion chiefly to a discussion of the ontology of such personages, giving a thumbnail historical sketch of this ontology; and to conclude with a cursory glimpse into the functions of such portraiture.' Literary artists and critics alike have convincingly testified to the use of living models2 and to the measurement of beauty in character by the semblance of viability achieved.3 They assume thereby that there is something of beauty in all such lives as are worthy to serve as models for literary portraits. And beyond this they have lent their commitments to the upbuilding of a widespread conviction that there are always some few people whose actual lives and careers may properly be characterized as beautiful. Thus Plato and many of his contempo- raries found the life of Socrates a constant source of mesthetic pleasure.4 That the lives of Cellini, Goethe, Lincoln, and many men of similar eminence have provided aesthetic experiences for their fellow-men is attested in scores of documents. This granted, it is apparent that we must at the outset investigate the nature of such actual people. Even a cursory study of the lives above cited clearly shows that a person so characterized is not neces- sarily beautiful in external appearance, nor necessarily good. He is I Other major divisions of the subject, such as the Ecology of Fictive Beings, Methods of Auctorial Portraiture, Varieties of Beauty in Literary Portraits, and Aesthetic Judg- ments of the Beauty of Dramatis Personae, will necessarily be excluded from present con- sideration. 2 For representative evidence see Aristotle; Poetics, tr.

The well- known maxims that "the style is the man," "character is destiny," and the like add their weight in behalf of this interpretation.6 We are led to believe, therefore, that it is precisely the same total mergence of a role with an individual being which constitutes the beauty of char- acter in literary portraits. Such portraits represent always the fusion of human destinies with fictive individuals in such a manner that the mean- ing or significance of these individuals seems to come alive and to be- come an attentionable part of perceived reality. This fusion is, then, the basic principle upon which any explanation of that beauty must depend. This basic theory is formulated by W. T. Stace in the proposition that beauty is the fusion of an intellectual content, consisting of empirical non- perceptual concepts, with a perceptual field, in such manner that the intellectual content and the perceptual field are indistinguishable from one another; and in such manner as to constitute the revelation of an aspect of reality.7 Stated in terms specifically relevant to our subject: the mesthetic pleas- ures of literary portraits derive fundamentally from the revelation of non-perceptual concepts concerning human destiny through the media- tion of fictional individuals. The nature of the fictional embodiments here referred to is a matter of common knowledge, but the non-perceptual concepts are entities less generally recognized. We are all familiar with various kinds of mental constructs. The most common are those mental abstractions which have tangible correlates in concrete objects, such as: negro, barn, running, envy, oblique. In contrast, many so-called "free" concepts have no phenomenal correlates, but represent instead those generalized con- clusions that are drawn "from areas of human experience so large they cannot be grasped together in any single act of perception."8 Examples of such non-perceptual concepts are: redemption is possible through persistent aspiration;9 jealousy defeats its own ends; adverse environs 5 For a discussion of the views expressed in this and the foregoing sentence see W.

They are too wide in their implications ever to be seen in any immediately perceptible field of individual being.'0 The break between such homeless abstractions and the realized sig- nificance of individual existence it is art's function to repair through its rhythmical disposal of selected data of individual experience, a process whereby it achieves a fusion of meanings with fictive beings." By this process the literary artist telescopes the data of buman experience so that the significance-bearing items are brought into juxtaposition and the resultant integration, a meaningful life, becomes an immediately perceived reality. We are now prepared to investigate the ontology, or theory of being, of literary personages. Of primary importance is the fact that these personages have always only a fictional existence. It is only in a fictional world that the manipulation of the data of experience by which char- acters are created is possible. Further, the fictional nature of these beings precludes practical reactions to them and thus renders them amenable to aesthetic apprehension alone.'2 "A cup or beaker," says Max Eastman, "if it is to be artistic, must not only satisfy our eye and hand and lip, but must stop us from drinking."'3 The major properties of being in dramatis persona are, then, non- perceptual concepts concerning life and perceptual fictive individuals. The first of these brings to the fusion the intangible phases of being, while the second supplies the illusion of a veritable embodiment. The non-perceptual concepts can have being only in the sense that in art they become living truths, of intrinsic worth, verifiable in experience or plausibly capable of becoming so. The fictive individuals provide their own evidence of being through their semblance to organic life. The correlates of these two elements are character and personality.

In the qualitative sense character in a literary personage is that phase of its being whereby its meaning, pur- pose, career, role, or destiny appears to be given direction and bounds by the pursuit of some intellectual ideal. The sense history of the term supports this view, as does also the nature of the literary form to which it has given its name.14 Thus interpreted, the character of a person is that part of him-even to the whole being in some instances-which is "moulded in a pattern, firm, consistent, dependable.""5 It is defined by Miinsterberg as "the power to keep the selected motive dominant throughout life,"'6 and by Dr. Roback as "an enduring psycho-physical disposition to inhibit instinctive impulses in accordance with a regula- tive principle."'7 This regulative principle is apparently identical with the intellectual ideal above mentioned,'8 and the inhibitions cited are those operative against any impulses whose indulgence might thwart the realization of the ideal. The formation of character of this sort comes by the maintenance of integrity in the midst of the social milieu, quite as Goethe says, Es bildet ein Talent sich in der Stille: Ein Charakter im Strome der Welt.19 Personality is quite distinct. It is the living whole of a being, un- canalized by any intellectual ideal. Its determination lies in the equi- table activity of all the faculties, so its indulgence of instinctive impulses is imperative. Its lone restriction is to be itself, to keep such bounds only as are prescribed by the coherence of all its achievements and po- tentialities-a coherence roughly comparable to that of an art work and in marked contrast to the rigidity of pattern in a character.2" Thus, while keeping to its course, as does a river within its banks, personality still remains ever open to growth and change, limited only by the bounds of whatever psycho-somatic individuality gives it embodiment. With the above definitions in mind we should be able to avoid mis- 14 For a varied selection of witnesses to this fact see Gwendolen Murphy, A Cabinet of Characters (London: Oxford University Press, 1925), Introduction, pp. v-viii; E.

For such peripheral radiations to con- stitute a personality would require that in themselves alone they ex- hibit a coherent individuality of such scope and complexity as to seem always incalculable and beyond the reach of the inevitable.21 For them to constitute evidences of character would require of them the demarca- tion of a circumscribed role, of a destiny necessarily rooted in person- ality22 but impersonalized to some degree by its intellectual ideal. The differentiation here set up is, of necessity, only relative, for both char- acter and personality are present to some degree in all people and so in- evitably, too, in all literary personages of any notable beauty. The dominance of one or the other gives the clue to the nature and kind of being in these personages and is a conditioning influence in the degree and quality of their beauty. The kinds and relationships of being manifested by the dramatis personce of literature are of infinite variety. Attempts to classify them have proven obstructive of aesthetic pleasure at times, and have occa- sionally had a reprehensible influence upon artistic practices ;23 but in the main they have been helpful to criticism and vesthetic judgment. Often, too, they have contributed to the enlargement and enrichment of the aestehtic faculties and thus shared indirectly in the building of an increased readiness and scope of appreciation.24 We can here attempt only to range the previously differentiated classes and relationships in a relatively consistent system such as will make clear the common bases of division, the criteria of distinctions within the major categories, and the accepted terminology throughout. It is only a panoramic glimpse of the whole province which I shall endeavor to present. The classes of literary figures are primarily differentiated by the various kinds of fictive being made manifest in them. Upon this basis of division there are distinguishable six kinds of dratmatis persona, marked respectively by their grade or order, unity, completeness, dura- tion, state, and mode of manifestation of being. The three fundamental 21 Cf. Calvin Thomas, "Literature and Personality," PMLA, xii, 3, n.s. v, 3 (1897), pp. 308-309. 21 This description of character is from W. D.

Clark, op. cit., pp. 71-72. 24 The widespread contributions of Aristotle and Horace in the development of character- ization are especially notable in this connection. Cf. D. L. Clark, op. cit., pp. 80-82.</page><page sequence="6">620 ,Esthetics of Literary Portraiture categories of ontology-quality, unity, and existence-include these six classes. 1. According to their grade or order of being, fictional persons are of three kinds: superhuman, non-human, and human. Owing to man's persistent anthropomorphism, however, this classification appears some- what spurious, for in the Gods we can find only such meanings as human psychic experience enables us to visualize.25 The Olympian figures of the Greek drama, the heavenly protagonists in the works of Dante and Milton, Goethe's Mephistopheles, Anatole France's Satanic Majesty and rebel angels-all the literary personages of the superhuman order are in their essential natures human, and transcend the mortals for the most part only in the superhuman degree to which they possess the human quality.26 But to further distinguish such personages and to en- franchise the deities from man's bodily limitations, we have almost in- variably ascribed to them somatic forms which differ in conspicuous but slight particulars from the human body. Whatever beauty such figures have must lie, then, in the fusion of meanings of superhuman degree with perceptual fields adequate to embody these meanings and still sufficiently manlike to afford them recognizable individual life. The same appears to be largely true also of the non-human figures in literary portraiture, except that here there is usually a desire to show inferiority rather than transcendence. Consequently the somatic forms given these figures are frequently pervaded by animal features. The con- cepts (or meanings), too, seem rather prevailingly those of the brute nature vestigial in humanity. Where this is not true, or only partly true, as in Shakespeare's Caliban and Ariel, Ibsen's Boyg, Hauptmann's Rautendelein, and in the celebrated ghosts of literature, the non- human figures invariably take on superhuman features to some degree. In either case they are always mainly human in essential significance. Both superhuman and non-human figures of beauty are extremely rare in literary portraiture. This is necessarily the case: for if the deities and earth-spirits be represented by the fusion of human forms and mean- ings, then the beauty of character appears to lie in the humanity made manifest; and if superhuman or non-human forms be employed con- 25 On the portrayal of superhuman figures in literature see A. C. Bradley, op. cit., pp. 29-30 and 172-174; L. P.

Wenger 621 viction that significant individual existence has been realized is almost impossible.27 Prometheus, Ariel, Caliban, and Rautendelein unmistak- ably come alive with beauty, but figures their like are so extraordinarily few as to confirm rather than refute the validity of our pronouncement. It is with fictive human personages, therefore, that our study is mainly concerned.28 2. On the basis of their unity of being, fictional persons are classifiable as consistent and inconsistent. Between these two extremes all possible gradations of unity and variety are possible. Few such persons remain always wholly "in character," and some "consistent inconsistency"29 seems required even of the most radically non-classical figures. Those of relatively high consistency tend to become type characters; those of high inconsistency, to approach complete personalities.30 The require- ments of consistency and decorum, asserted and reasserted from Aris- totle to Fielding, were unquestionably responsible for that foreshorten- ing of the dramatis personce into types which was almost without ex- ception in the practice of the ancient writers and hardly less general in the portraiture of the neo-classicists.31 The occasional Tom Jones who escaped the devitalizing influence of a narrow consistency is evidence of a liberalizing inconsistency which ever and again crept into the practice of the dogmatists themselves.32 But even so, Fielding has his Blifil and his Squire Alworthy. Meanwhile those who, from the Renais- sance on, remained unaware of or indifferent to the doctrinaire view- point were demonstrating beyond refutation that character creations capture the beauty of individual lives in proportion only as they mani- fest the inconsistency of these lives within the wide limits of integrated beings.33 A group of literary personages in which the portrayal of dual or multiple personality is attempted forces upon us a third class in the province under discussion. However, since it is generally agreed that unity of being is one of the a priori conditions of individual life, the ever-recurrent attempts, both in theory and artifact, to demonstrate its multiplicity must necessarily to some degree constitute a negation of all being. In spite of this, or perhaps because of it, the attempts 27 Cf. William Hazlitt, op. cit., p. 172, and L. P. Smith, op. cit., pp. 98-100. 28 "Man, therefore, is the highest subject."

Howells, op. cit., pp. 80 and 176.</page><page sequence="8">622 ?sthetics of Literary Portraiture mentioned have remained perenially alluring, even though the dramatis persone of this class have almost invariably been wanting in beauty. The failure to achieve beauty in portraits of multiple personalities seems inescapable. The meanings in such figures, for one thing, seem still too uncertain to be effectively fused. But granted that these mean- ings might, under the egis of contemporary psychology,34 be sufficiently clarified to become fusible, the major difficulty still remains. The artist has still the task of exhibiting in a coherent individual two or more r6les of such conflicting natures that they palpably separate the in- dividual into a like number of autonomous personalities. If to this end a single fictive person be employed, the duality or multiplicity remains unrealized; whereas, if more than one are used, there results a plurality of perceptual fields and the conditions of beauty in the portraiture seem inescapably violated.35 Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde have, un- mistakably, a realized duality; but unfortunately for the realization of beauty in character, this duality persists in the realm of somatic forms as well as in that of character meanings. There appear always to be two men, two perceptual fields. The same is true of the protagonists in Eugene O'Neill's The Great God Brown, though here there is not that sharp distinctness which strikes one in Stevenson's work.36 3. On the basis of their completeness of being, fictional persons are classifiable into three major kinds; namely, symbols, types, and com- plete individualities. The various minor classes distinguishable on the same basis, such as allegorical, stock, and lay figures, puppets and marionettes, are usually but modifications or divergent aspects of one or another of the major kinds. Although literary personages of impor- tance elude complete inclusion in any one of these categories, yet scarcely any figure in all literature fails to show some scantiness or fullness of being such as to range it predominantly in one of the groups specified. Symbolic personages, unlike mathematical symbols, are conditioned by a necessary resemblance to the things symbolized. When this like- ness extends throughout their nature and acts they become allegorical. So far as they have beauty, such figures manifest the fusion of concepts or meanings not inherently their own, yet recognizably like their own, 34 Clifford Kirkpatrick, "Concepts of the Newer Psychology," in Man and His World, ed. J, H. S. Bossard (New York: Harper &amp; Bros., 1932), pp. 367-383. 35 Consider in this connection also the transmuting figures in Strindberg's A Dream Play, tr. E. Bjorkman, in Plays, First Series (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1912) and in Virginia Woolf's Orlando (New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1928). 3 For an analysis of the dual personality in Franz Werfel's Spiegelmensch see William Rose, Men, Myths, and Movements in German Literature (London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1931), pp. 221-222.</page><page sequence="9">Christian N. Wenger 623 with perceptual individuals amenable to the admission of such extrinsic significance. Thus Faust becomes a symbol of all modern occidental humanity,37 while Christian, of Pilgrim's Progress, is throughout an allegorical figure, representative of a salvational destiny in Christendom. The type personage is one whose direction and bounds are prescribed by an intellectual ideal in the form of a human trait or quality. This ideal, in contrast to the meaning of a symbolic figure, is inherently the person's own. Only such figures may properly be said to have character.38 The thing typified in them may be any conceptual role which human intellection has generalized and given recognized demarcations. Whether the r6le be distinguished by sensations, emotions, imaginings, thoughts, or acts matters not, provided only that its directions and bounds have been intellectually conceived and have recognizably set the limits of the character. Type figures are seldom beautiful, for the rigidity of meanings in them is imperatively so pronounced that complete fusion with fictive beings is always to some degree thwarted and the concepts remain more or less lifeless abstractions.39 This is not to deny that such personages have intellectual values; however, it is highly doubtful if any other beauty such works might have could ever fully compensate for the want of it in their fictional characters.40 The highest degrees of beauty in character are to be found in literary personages of complete fullness of being. Such personages most come alive and have significance of corresponding scope and vitality.41 They at once have and are personalities. In them panoramic truths concern- ing man's purpose and destiny find perfect fusion with fictional lives. Yet they remain always difficult to interpret fully, for they transcend all set definitions and ideals. Beyond all the commonly accepted mean- ings and the myriad individual interpretations men have found for Hamlet, there abides always something still left over to discover in the melancholy Prince.42 Such is the case, too, with Faust, Peer Gynt, Don Quixote, and many another figure of like proportions. Personages of this sort grow as we take on increased ability to understand them. Their fullness consists always partly of suggested potentialities unrealized in 37 Consult the various references to Faustian and Western Culture in Oswald Spengler, The Decline of the West, tr. C. F. Atkinson, 2 vols. (New York: Knopf &amp; Co., 1926, 1928). For the page references see the index to vol ri. 38 On this somewhat loose identification of type with character see E. C. Baldwin, op. cit., p. 64. 39 This is obviously less true of universal types, such as Odysseus, for instance, than of narrowly typical ones, such as people the works of Ben Jonson and the Restoration dramas. 40 Cf.

Within the province of dramatis personce distinguished by their duration of being, there is no set number of distinct classes, but only a graded series between clearly defined extremes. The terminal types of this series are persons that have single moments of being and those that have full life-cycles. Wherever durational significance is given to the span of life allowed such persons, here the metaphysical entity, time, appears to condition human existence. In this there may be the implication that life is a matter of moments,44 or, at the opposite ex- treme, moments may be so subordinated that the continuity and whole- ness of life are postulated as of supreme importance.45 In this matter the unity of time intrudes, too, and the aesthetic effect varies accordingly as the duration of being presented is one of contiguous or one of divided moments of existence.46 Contrarily, and transcending time, even multiple life-cycles may be presented within the coherence of a single individual thereby to suggest the many strange meanings fore and aft from our little lifetimes, or those still stranger ones which seem enfranchised from time by means of foresight and remembrance.47 A matter of high importance to which we can here give but passing notice is the potent influence which the duration of being in fictional personages has upon the choice of genres. Other factors sometimes have paramount sway in the selection of literary forms, but the time span presented still always conditions the magnitude and so has always a significant part in determining the preferred genre.48 5. According to their state of being, the characters of literature are either static or dynamic. The dynamic ones may have either develop- mental or degenerative motility. The usual objective of static character presentation is to make manifest the meanings of existence in its matured and immutable aspects.49 There is here no indication of how a person- 43 Cf. E. H.

Wenger 625 age's character or personality came to be what it is, nor of how it might presumably become something different. In dynamic figures, on the contrary, the meanings fused with the fictive individuals involve pre- eminently just such questions.50 Here the agencies whereby character and personality are formed, modified or destroyed become dominant considerations. In the nature and behavior of those agencies to which he ascribes the formation and change of character in his dramatis personc, the literary artist most reveals his own Weltanschauung, for in just these agencies we discover the artist's conception of the controlling forces of the universe.51 6. Finally, we have still to consider those classes of fictional persons that are distinguished in accordance with the mode of manifestation of being. The two clearly differentiated classes of this province, sub- jective and objective, are acceptably defined for our common under- standing.52 We need pause here, then, only to explain the operation of the principle of beauty in personages of these two types and to indicate certain significant problems which arise in that connection. A fictional person whose being has chiefly a subjective mode of mani- festation is obviously one in whom the concept or meaning has reference primarily to the inner life. Our recently enlarged understanding of the psychic processes, especially in the subconscious realm, has correspond- ingly increased the range of concepts fused with the fictive individuals of contemporary literature.53 But to expect the dramatis personce who bear evidence of this widened understanding to show at once also more realistic, abundant, and beautiful personalities would be to forget the basic difficulties involved in effectively presenting concepts con- cerning the subjective life. Where the manifest being of fictional persons is evidenced chiefly by subjective data there appears no perceptual field that comes alive as a fictive individual reality. Browning to the contrary notwithstanding,54 there must be incorporated in the por- traiture sufficient objective data, such as life regularly shows in associa- tion with the given subjective ones, if the persons presented are to have convincing fictive existence. Until that is done the concepts of the newer psychology,55 or of any other intellectual explorations, find no adequate perceptual fields with which to fuse and so remain but 50 Cf. L. P. Smith, op. cit. pp. 96-97, and A. C. Bradley, op. cit., pp. 359-362. 51 Cf. George H.

Browning's Para- celsus, Strafford, and Sordello are but three among many literary per- sonages whose want of life and beauty rests primarily upon too exclusive a use of subjective data in their portraiture. Despite all the requisite concessions to inner perception and to other relevant factors, it remains incontrovertible that a considerable majority of mankind apprehend perceptual realities more fully and understand- ingly when these manifest themselves in sensuous form, or with the illusion of such form.56 It follows that fictional persons whose being has chiefly an objective mode of manifestation seem best to achieve that illusion of meaningful life which is imperative for beauty in character.57 The increased viability of the dramatis personc, in German literature after the vogue of expressionism died down is but one of many witnesses to the indispensability of the objective mode for a lifelike manifestation of being in literary portraiture."8 Throughout history the theory of being of literary personages has undergone changes of profound import. Owing to the limitations im- posed we shall find it most profitable to survey these mutations with reference only to the three outstanding modes of literary portraiture: the classical, the romantic, and the vitalistic modes. Roughly speaking, the three may be said to have held sway in chronological sequence, in the order named; but all three have been to some degree current in all ages.59 The classicists have regularly subordinated their characters to plot action. Typification has been their traditional method of character presentation; hence their literary personages have always been type figures whose prime requirement was that they be consistent.60 Among the ancient Greeks these figures were usually ideal character types whose meanings had relevance to significant human experience every- where and always.61 In the latter part of the ancient classical period some of this amplitude was already lost,62 and this narrowing process 18 Browning himself concedes much in this direction. Cf., for example, the Essay on Shelley, op. cit., p. 1009. 67 In addition to Browning's study of the objective and subjective in the "Essay on Shelley" see also A. A.

Wenger 627 continued until in Renaissance and Neo-classical times the type figures often represented only standardized professional roles or mere conven- tional traits of character. Some of the dramatis persone in the works of Ben Jonson and Moliere show this typicality in its extreme form. Many of the character creations of Goldsmith and Sheridan have it to a high degree. Patriarch Goeze in Lesseing's Nathan der Weise is so narrowly typical that he seems to some a mere caricature.63 Likewise Henry Fielding's Blifil and Squire Alworthy, to whom we have previously re- ferred, are to some degree dehumanized by their restriction to trait representation.64 The increasing narrowness of typification just described is by no means the exclusive, nor even the dominant, trend throughout the period above specified. Already in Jonson's time Shakespeare and other contemporaries were creating characters who outran typification and had relatively little consistency. Throughout the seventeenth and eight- eenth centuries there was ebb and flow in the degree to which this mode of presentation was employed, but the general tendency was toward less narrowness and singleness of traits in the literary portraits. This trend persisted so that by the late nineteenth century there again appeared numerous fictive personages who were types only in the sense that they represented humanity itself, in blocks of experience that are ever- recurrent and of abiding significance.65 Narrow typification persisted, to be sure, but came to be less and less the dominant practice of the major artists.66 From first impressions one is tempted to say that the classical mode of treatment gave us characters; the romantic one, personalities. Deeper study and reflection reveals this statement to be but a misleading part- truth, for the personages of romantic literature are still far from fully rounded individuals. They are, instead, figures whose direction and bounds are prescribed chiefly by emotional and imaginative objectives rather than by intellectual ideals.67 I must forego the development of this thesis, but may cite Goethe's Werther as the sort of portraiture upon which I should build a case.68 Individuals limited to one or a few affective attributes are here the rule, and in them we see personality 63 Gustav Gruener, op. cit., p. 78. "4 Cf. Henry Fielding, op. cit., I 334. 65 Peer Gynt is but one of many notable examples. 66 Figures done during the naturalistic interlude are exceptions. On narrow types in contemporary literature see Edith Wharton, "Tendencies in Modem Fiction," S.R.L., x, 28 (Jan. 27, 1934). 67 Cf. L. P. Smith, op. cit., pp. 100 (footnote) and 103-104. 68 Says Ramon Fernandez, "man dehumanizes himself by excess of affectivity at least as much as by excess of rationality. .. ."

Figures done in the romantic mode are perennial, but tend to become the prevailing type only in periods when emotional and imaginative faculties are in the ascendant.7' Vast lures to men's bodies or to their spirits, or to both, may inaugurate such periods. Sometimes they appear as reactions to eras dominated by intellectual aims and pursuits. One dare hardly generalize concerning the sequence. The Odyssey followed the Iliad; Shakespeare interspersed romantic creations among works of other tone colors; Goethe's Werther preceded his more classical produc- tions. The Renaissance was partly a reaction to Scholasticism, but like- wise the Romantic Era was partly a reaction to the Age of Enlighten- ment. And if a gallery of romantic figures in contemporary writing ap- pear to be the product of a reaction to naturalism, one has only to remember the dramatis personct drawn by the symbolists and the ex- pressionists to correct any impulsive formulation of hard and fast con- clusions. It seems safe to infer that personages done in this mode be- come prevalent during the terminal epochs of pervasive cultural changes; but we cannot be sure, for we know comparatively little as yet of the ecology of these elusive figures. Although vitalistic may be in some respects a misleading term, it ap- pears to be especially happy for the designation of the third mode of character presentation. If we dissociate from it the narrower of its vari- ous Bergsonian connotations,72 its comprehensiveness, whereby to in- clude all the elusive contingencies of life, makes it particularly apt; for by vitalistic portraiture we mean the presentation of fully rounded per- sonalities, of personages bounded only by the coherence of their whole psycho-somatic beings. Hamlet, Faust, Peer Gynt, and dramatis per- sone of like dimensions must have been conceived along these lines. There have been no periods when this mode of treatment was unmis- takably dominant, but whenever the full abundance of life has been the unimpeded prime objective with which literary artists have infused their character creations, then the vitalistic mode has been operative 69 Cf. Justin O'Brien, op. cit., pp. 394-395, and W. D. Howells, op. cit., pp. 114, 162, and 190. 70 William Hazlitt, "On the Character of Milton's Eve," op. cit., p. 105. 71 Cf. P. E.

There are, in generalized terms, two of these functions: to provide objects for aesthetic pleasures and to furnish subjects for aesthetic judgment.74 A thorough analysis of the many other ends such portrait work may serve will discover, I believe, that all of them are subordinate to one or the other of these two. Men take pleasure in the beauty of literary personages because they find that in these portraits their intellectual discoveries concerning human purposes, roles, and destinies have become living truths, realized or undergoing realization in viable fictive individuals.75 In that beauty they see these truths verified. In the representations of beings like themselves they find reparation of the break between truths about life and the living process itself; hence in these fictional beings they them- selves have vicarious experience of the living of significant and therefore beautiful lives.76 In addition to providing objects for aesthetic pleasures the dramatis personce of literary art also furnish us subjects for aesthetic judgments. The former are values of immediate apprehension; the latter, of mediate acquisition-the first-fruits of reflection.77 Though practical reality is denied such judgments-or rather because of this-they are among the most valuable and highly prized of all human judgments, for in their appraisals of the beauty of truth come to life in fictional individuals they themselves share the interpretive beauties of the things they ap- praise. Because they are judgments of beauty they themselves become beautiful meanings. Thus they serve doubly to enlarge the understand- ing and to enhance the practice of living; yet without becoming them- selves involved in the interests, prejudices, and vicissitudes of phenom- enal experience. Only those capable of aesthetic judgments concerning fictive human destiny can justly dispose of the biases, distractions, clutter, and emptiness of actual existence and so find possible an in- tellectual faith in the beauty of life.
