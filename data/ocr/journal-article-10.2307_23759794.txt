The overwhelming majority of the artifacts are of unknown provenance, donated by villagers of Uaxactun or looters, and bought by Dona Neria from locals (Grube 1996, 1999). Among these plates are two unprovenanced and hitherto unpublished splendid decorated polychrome tripod plates, which were documented in 1998. The complete ceramic tripod plate shown on the cover photo is 5 cm high and has a diameter of 33 cm. The plate has no known place of origin, but is said to be from Dos Lagunas in the northern area of the Department of Peten. The painting on the interior of the vessel is executed in red and black on a cream-coloured slip and depicts a dancing male figure with outstretched arms and with the profile head turned to the left. The dancer, probably depicting the Young Maize God, is encircled by a band of repetitive glyphs, written in black. The plate has a so-called kill hole, or termination hole. The second polychrome tripod plate (figure below) is mended and incomplete, and painted in the same style as the first one. The vessel is 10 cm high and has a diameter of 35 cm. The bottom image portrays also a male dancer which is surrounded by a circular band of astronomical symbols and a band containing three pairs of the same glyph written in black and dark red color. The dynamic anthropomorphic figure, the circles and symbols are also painted in black and dark red on a cream slip. The rim area is divided in half, one showing glyphs and diverse lines and points, the other half is just red coloured. Both tripod plates belong to the so-called „Tikal-Dancer Plate" corpus as described by Dorie Reents-Budet (1994: 339). They are funerary vessels and date probably to the Late Classic period. Also to this corpus belongs a Late Classic tripod with a diameter of 35.6 cm found in a tomb within Structure A-I at Uaxactun (Sharer 1994: 693, fig. 15.17), and two Ik-Complex plates excavated in Tikal (Culbert 1993, figs. 43a, 48c).
