<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Images from �he Kegion  of the Pueblo Indians  of North America  Es ist ein altes Buch zu bliittern,  Athen-Oraibi, alles Vettern.  It is a lesson from an old book:  the kinship of Athens and Oraibi.  If I am to show you images, most of which I photo­ graphed myself, from a journey undertaken sorne twenty­ seven years in the past, and to accompany them with  words, then it behooves me to preface my attempt with  an explanation. The few weeks I have had at my disposal  ha ve not given me the chance to revive and to work  through my old memories in such a way that I might offer  you a solid introduction into the psychic life of the Indi­ ans. Moreover, even at the time, I was unable to give  depth to my impressions, as I had not mastered the In­ dian language. And here in fact is the reason why it is so  difficult to work on these pueblos: Nearby as they live to  each other, the Pueblo Indians speak so many and such  varied languages that even American scholars have the  </page> <page sequence="2"> 2 greatest difficulty penetrating even one of them. In addi­ tion, a j ourney limited to several weeks could not impart  truly profound impressions . If these impressions are now  more blurred than they were, I can only assure you that,  in sharing my distant memories ,  aided by the immediacy  of the photographs, what I have to say will offer an im­ pression both of a world whose culture is  dying out and  of a problem of decisive importance in the general writ­ ing of cultural history: In what ways can we perceive es­ sential character traits of primitive pagan humanity ?  The Pueblo Indians derive their name from their sed­ entary lives in villages ( Spanish: pueblos ) as opposed to  the nomadic lives of the tri bes who until several decades  ago warred and hunted in the same areas of New Mexico  and Arizona where the Pueblos now live .  What interested me as a cultural historian was that in  the midst of a country that had made technological cul­ ture into an admirable precision weapon in the hands of  intellectual man, an enclave of primitive pagan humanity  was  ab l e  to mainta in  i t s e l f  and-an ent i re ly  s obe r   struggle for existence notwithstanding-to engage i n   hunting and agriculture with an  unshakable adherence to  magical practices that we are accustomed to condemning  as a mere symptom of a completely backward humanity.  Here,  however, what we would cal l  superstition goes   hand in hand with livelihood.  It consists of a religious  devotion to natural phenomena, to animal s and plants, to  which the Indians attribute active souls,  which they be­ lieve they can influence primarily through their masked  dances .  To us ,  this synchrony of fantastic magic and so­ ber purposiveness appears as a symptom of a cleavage;  for the Indian this is  not schizoid but, rather, a liberating  experience of the boundless communicabil ity between  man and environment .  At the same time, one aspect of the Pueblo Indians'   religious psychology requires that our analysis proceed  with the greatest caution.  The material is  contaminated :   ABY M.

From the end of the six­ teenth century, the Native American foundation was  overlaid by a stratum of Spanish Catholic Church educa­ tion, which suffered a violent setback at the end of the  seventeenth century, to return thereafter but never offi­ cially to reinstate itself in the Moki villages. And then  carne the third stratum: North American education.  Yet closer study of Pueblo pagan religious formation  and practice reveals an objective geographic constant,  and that is the scarcity of water. For so long as the rail­ ways remained unable to reach the settlements, drought  and desire for water led to the same magical practices to­ ward the binding of hostile natural forces as they did in  primitive, pretechnological cultures all over the world.  Drought teaches magic and prayer.  IMAGES FROM THE REGION OF THE PUEBLO INDIANS  </page> <page sequence="4"> 4 The specific issue of religious symbolism is revealed  in the ornamentation of pottery. A drawing 1 obtained  personally from an Indian will show how apparently  purely decorative ornaments must in fact be interpreted  symbolically and cosmologically and how alongside one  basic element in cosmologic imagery-the universe con­ ceived in the form of a house-an irrational animal figure  appears as  a mysterious and fearsome demon: the ser­ pent. But the most drastic form of the animistic (i . e . ,  na­ ture-inspiring ) Indian cult  is the masked dance,  which 1  shall show first in the form of a pure animal dance, sec­ ond in the form of a tree-worshipping dance, and finally  as  a dance with live serpents .  A glance at similar phenom­ ena in pagan Europe will bring us,  finally, to the follow­ ing question: To what extent does this pagan world view,  as  it persists among the Indians, give us a yardstick for  the development from primitive paganism, through the  paganism of classical antiquity, to modern man ?  AH in aH it is a piece of earth only barely equipped by na­ ture, which the prehistoric and historie inhabitants of the  region have chosen to call their home. Apart from the nar­ row, furrowing vaHey in the northeast, through which the  Rio Grande del Norte flows to the Gulf of Mexico, the  landscape here consists essentially of plateaus: extensive,  horizontally situated masses of limestone and tertiary  rock, which soon form higher plateaus with steep edges  and smooth surfaces. (The term mesa compares them with  tables.) These are often pierced by flowing waters, ... by  ravines and canyons sometimes a thousand feet deep and  more, with waHs that from their highest points plummet  almost verticaHy, as if they had been sliced with a saw. ...  For the greater part of the year the plateau landscape re­ mains entirely without precipitation and the vast majority  of the canyons are completely dried up; only at the time  that snow melts and during the brief rainy periods do pow­ erful water masses roar through the bald ravines.1  ABY M. WARBURG  </page> <page sequence="5"> In this regio n of the Colorado plateau of the Rocky 5  Mountains,  where the states of  Colorado, Utah,  New  Mexico, and Arizona meet, the ruined sites of prehistoric  communities  survive alongside the currently inhabited  Indian villages .  In the northwestern part of the plateau,  in the state of Colorado, are the now abandoned cliff­ dwellings :  houses built into clefts of rock. The eastern  group consists  of  approximately eighteen vil lages,  al l   relatively accessible from Santa Fe and Albuquerque . The  especially important villages of the Zuñi lie more to the  southwest and can be reached in a day's journey from  Fort Wingate . The hardest to reach-and therefore the  most undisturbed in the preservation of ancient ways- are the villages of the Moki (Hopi ) ,  six in all, rising out of  three parallel ridges of rock.  In the midst, in the plains, lies the Mexican settlement  of  Santa Fe, now the capital  of  New Mexico,  having  come under the dominion of the United Sta tes after a  hard struggle, which lasted into the last century. From  here, and from the neighboring town of Albuquerque,  one can reach the majority of the eastern Pueblo villages  without great difficulty.  Near Albuquerque is the village of Laguna, which,  though it does not l ie quite so  high as the others, pro­ vides a very good example of  a Pueblo settlement.  The  actual village lies on the far side of  the Atchison-To­ pe ka-Santa Fe  railway l ineo  The European settlement,  below in the plain, abuts on the station. The indigenous  village consists of two-storied houses .  The entrance i s   from the top : one climbs up a ladder, a s  there i s  no door  at the bottom .  The original reason for this type of  house  was its superior defensibil ity against enemy attack. In  this  way the Pueblo Indians developed a cross between a  house and a fortification which i s  characteristic of  their  c iv i l izat ion and probably reminiscent  of  prehistoric   American t ime s .  It i s  a terraced structure o f  houses   whose ground floors s i t  on second houses which can sit  IMAGES FROM THE REGION OF THE PUEBLO INDIANS  </page> <page sequence="6"> 6  Fig. 2.

In the interior of such a house, small dolls are sus­ pended from the ceiling-not mere toy dolls but rather  like the figures of saints that hang in Catholic farmhouses  ( Figure 2). They are the so-called kachina dolls: faithful  representations of the masked dancers, the demoniac me­ diators between man and nature at the periodic festivals  that accompany the annual harvest cycle and who consti­ tute sorne of the most remarkable and unique expressions  ABY M.

On the wall, in  contradistinction to these dolls, hangs the symbol of in­ truding American culture: the broom.  But the most essential product of the applied arts,  with both practical and religious purposes, is the earthen­ ware pot, in which water is carried in all its urgency and  scarcity. The characteristic style for the drawings on  these pots is a skeletal heraldic image. A bírd, for ex­ ample, may be dissected into its essential component  parts to form a heraldic abstraction . It becomes a  lMAGES FROM THE REGlON OF THE PUEBLO lND lANS  </page> <page sequence="8"> 8 hieroglyph, not simply to be looked at but, rather, to be  read (Figure 3) . We have here an intermediary stage be­ tween a naturalistic image and a sign, between a realistic  mirror image and writing. From the ornamental treat­ ment of such animals ,  one can immediately see how this  manner of seeing and thinking can lead to symbolic pic­ tographic writing.  The bird plays an important part in Indian mythical  perception, as  anyone familiar with the Leatherstocking  Tales knows.  Apart from the devotion it receives ,  like ev­ ery other animal, as  a totem, as  an imaginary ancestor,  the bird commands a special devotion in the context of  the burial culto It seems even that a thieving bird-spirit  be longed to  the fundamental  representat ions  of the   mythical fantasies of the  prehistoric Sikyatki .  The bird  has a place in idolatrous cults for its feathers .  The Indians  have made a spec ia l  prayer instrument out of  smal l   sticks-bahos; tied with feathers ,  they are  placed on fe­ tish altars and planted on graves .  According to the au­ thoritative explanations of the Indians, the feathers act as   winged entities bearing the Indians' wishes and prayers  to their demoniac essences in nature .  There is no doubt that contemporary Pueblo pottery  shows the influence of medieval Spanish technique, as  it  was brought to the Indians by the Jesuits in the eigh­ teenth century. The excavations of Fewkes have estab­ lished incontrovertably, however, that an older potting  technique existed ,  autonomous from the Spanish . 2 It   bears the same heraldic bird motives together with the  serpent, which for the Mokis-as in all pagan religious  practice-commands cultic devotion as  the most vital  symbol .  This serpent still appears on the base of cont em ­ porary vessels exactly as  Fewkes found it on prehistoric  ones: coiled, with a feathered head. On the rims, four ter­ race-shaped attachments carry small representations of  animals .  We know from work on Indian mysteries that  these animals-for example,  the frog and the spider- ABY M.

In the kiva, at the core of  devotional practice, the serpent appears as the symbol of  lightning (Figure 1).  In my hotel in Santa Fe, I received from an Indian,  Cleo Jurino, and his son, Anacleto Jurino, original draw­ ings that, after sorne resistance, they made before my eyes  IMAGES FROM THE REGION OF THE PUEBLO INDIANS  </page> <page sequence="10"> 10 and in which they outlined their cosmologic world view  with colored pencils (Figure 4) . The father, Cleo, was one  of the priests and painter of the kiva in Cochiti . The  drawing showed the serpent as a weather deity, as  it hap­ pens, unfeathered but otherwise portrayed exactly as it  appears in the image on the vase, with an arrow-pointed  tongue . The roof of the worldhouse bears a stair-shaped  gable . Above the waHs spans a rainbow, and from massed  clouds below flows the rain, represented by short strokes .   In the middle, as the true master of the stormy world­ house, appears the fetish ( not a serpent figure ) :  Yaya or  Yerrick.   In the presence of such paintings the pious Indian in­ vokes the storm with aH its blessings through magical  practices,  of which to us  the most astonishing is  the han­ dling of live, poisonous serpents .  As we saw in Jurino's  drawing, the serpent in its lightning shape is magicaHy  linked to lightning.  The stair-shaped roof of the worldhouse and the ser­ pent-arrowhead, along with the serpent itself, are consti­ tutive elements in the Indians' symbolic language of im­ ages .  1 would suggest without any doubt that the stairs  contain at least a Pan-American and perhaps a worldwide  symbol of the cosmos .   A photograph of the underground kiva of S ia ,  after  Mrs .  Stevenson, shows the organization of a carved light­ ning altar as  the focal point of sacrificial ceremony, with  the lightning serpent in the company of other sky-ori­ ented symbols . Ir is  an altar for l ightning from aH points  of the compass .  The Indians crouching before it have  placed their sacrificial offerings on the altar and hold in  their hand the symbol of mediating prayer:  the feather  (Figure 5 ) .

We traveled through this gorse-grown wilderness for  about six hours, until we could see the village emerging  from the sea of rock, like a Heligoland in a sea of sand.

They are ornamented in white, red, or blue and make a  most pieturesque impression.  IMAGES FROM THE REGION OF THE PUEBLO IND IANS  </page> <page sequence="14"> I4  Fig. 8. Acoma.

The priest, who  understood not a word of the Indian language, had to  employ an interpreter who translated the mass sentence  by sentence and may well have said whatever he pleased.  It occurred to me during the service that the wall  was  covered with pagan cosmologic symbols, exactly in the  style drawn for me by Cleo Jurino. The church of Laguna  is also covered with such painting, symbolizing the cos- ABY M. WARBURG  </page> <page sequence="15"> Fig. 9. Sta ir ornament carved from a tree. Warburg's photograph .  mos with a stair-shaped roof ( Figure 8). The jagged orna­ ment symbolizes a stair, and indeed not a perpendicular,  square stair but rather a much more primitive form of a  stair, carved from a tree, which still exists among the  Pueblos ( Figure 9).  In the representation of the evolution, ascents, and  descents of nature, steps and ladders embody the primal  experiences of humanity. They are the symbol for upward  and downward struggle in space, just as the circle-the  IMAGES FROM THE REGION OF THE PUEBLO INDIANS  </page> <page sequence="16"> 16  coiled serpent-is the symbol for the rhythm o f  time .  Man, who no longer moves on four limbs but walks up­ right and is  therefore in need of a prop in order to over­ come gravity as he looks upward, invented the stair as a  means to dignify what in relation to animals are his infe­ rior gifts .  Man, who learns to stand upright in his second  year, perceives the felicity of the step beca use,  as a crea­ ture that has to learn how to walk, he thereby receives the  grace of holding his head aloft .  Standing upright is the  human act par excellence, the striving of the earthbound  toward heaven, the uniquely symbolic act that gives to  walking man the nobility of the erect and upward-turned  head.  Contemplation of the sky i s  the grace and curse of  humanity.  Thus the Indian creates the rational element in his  cosmology through his equation of the worldhouse with  his own staired house, which is  entered by way of a lad­ der. But we must be careful not to regard this worldhouse  as a simple expression of a spiritually tranquil cosmol­ ogy; for the mistres s  of  the worldhouse remains the  uncanniest of creatures: the serpent.  The Pueblo Indian is  a hunter as well as a tiller of the  soil-if not to the same extent as the savage tri bes that  once lived in the region.  He depends for his subsistence  on meat as well as  on corno The masked dances ,  which at  first seem to us like festive accessories to everyday life ,   are  in fact magical practices for the  social provision of  food .  The masked dance, upon which we might ordi­ narily look as a form of play, is  in its essence an earnest,  indeed warlike, measure in the fight for existence .  AI­ though the exclusion of  bloody and sadistic practices  makes these dances fundamentally different from the war  dances of the nomadic Indians, the Pueblos'  worst en­ emies, we must not forget that these remain, in their ori­ gin and inner tendency, dances of plunder and sacrifice .   When the hunter or tiller of the soil  masks himself, trans- ABY M. WARBURG  </page> <page sequence="17"> forms himself into an imitation of his booty-be that ani- I7  mal or corn-he believes that through mysterious,  mimic  transformation he will be able  to procure in advance  what he coterminously strives to achieve through his so- ber, vigilant work as  tiller and hunter. The dances are ex­ pressions of applied magic . The social provision of food  is  schizoid:  magic and technology work together.  The synchrony [Nebeneinander] of logical civiliza­ tion and fantastic, magical causation shows the Pueblo  Indians ' peculiar condition of hybridity and transition .  They are clearly no longer primitives dependent on their  senses,  for whom no action directed toward the future  can exist; but neither are they technologically secure Eu­ ropeans, for whom future events are expected to be or­ ganically or mechanically determined .  They stand on  middle ground between magic and logos, and their in­ strument of orientation is  the symbol .  Between a culture  of touch and a culture of thought is  the culture of sym­ bolic connection. And for this stage of symbolic thought  and conduct, the dances of the Pueblo Indians are exem­ plary.  When 1 first saw the antelope dance in San Ildefonso,  it struck me as quite harmless and almost comical .  But  for the folklorist interested in a biologic understanding of  the roots of human cultural expression, there is no mo­ ment more dangerous than when he is  moved to laugh at  popular practices that strike him as comical .  To laugh at  the comical element in ethnology is wrong, because it in­ stantly shuts off insight into the tragic element o  At San Ildefonso-a pueblo near Santa Fe which has  long been under American influence-the Indians as­ sembled for the dance . The musicians gathered first ,   armed with a large drum. (You can see them standing, in  Figure 10, in front of the Mexi.:ans on horseback . )  Then  the dancers arranged themselves into two parallel rows  and assumed the character of the antelope in mask and  posture .  The two rows moved in two different ways .  lMAGES FROM THE REGlON OF THE  PUEBLO lNDlANS   </page> <page sequence="18"> I8  Fig. 10. Antelope dance at San Ildefonso.  Either they imitated the animal's way of walking, or  they supported themse lves on their front legs-small  stilts wound with feathers-making movements with  them while standing in place .  At the head of each row  stood a female figure and a hunter. With regard to the  female figure , I was able  to learn only that she  was  called the "mother of all animals . " 3 To her the animal  mime addresses  his invocations .  The insinuation into the animal mask al lows the  hunting dance to simulate the actual hunt through an an­ ticipatory capture of the animal . This measure is not to  be regarded as mere play. In their bonding with the  extrap ersonal, the masked dances  signify for primitive  man the most thorough subordination to sorne alien be­ ing . When the Indian in his mimetic costume imitates ,  for  instance ,  the expressions and movements of an animal ,   ABY M. WARBURG  </page> <page sequence="19"> he insinuates himself into an animal form not out of fun I9  but,  rather, to wrest something magical  from nature  through the transformation of his person,  something he  cannot atta in by means of his unextended and unchanged  personality.  The simulated pantomimic animal dance is thus a  cultic act of the highest devotion and self-abandon to an  al ien being.  The masked dance of so-cal led primitive  peoples is  in its original essence a document of social pi­ ety. The Indian's inner attitude to the animal is entirely  different from that of the European. He regards the ani­ mal as  a higher being, as the integrity of its animal nature  makes  it  a much more gifted creature than man,  its   weaker counterpart.  My initiation into the psychology of the will to ani­ mal metamorphosis carne, j ust before my departure , from  Frank Hamilton Cushing, the pioneering and veteran ex­ plorer of the Indian psyche.  I found his insights person­ ally overwhelming. This pockmarked man with sparse  reddish ha ir and of inscrutable age, smoking a cigarette ,  said to me that an Indian had once told him, why should  man stand taller than animals ? "Take a good look at the  antelope, she is aH running, and runs so much better than  man-or the bear, who is all strength . Men can only do in  part what the animal is, totally." This fairy-tale way of  thinking, no matter how odd it may sound, is the prelimi­ nary to our scientific, genetic explanation of the world.  These Indian pagans, like pagans all over the world, form  an attachment out of reverential awe-what i s  known as  totemism-to the animal world, by believing in animal s  of all kinds as the mythical ancestors of their tribes .  Their  explanation of the world as  inorganicaHy coherent is not  so far removed from Darwinism; for whereas we impute  natural law to the autonomous process of evolution in  nature, the pagans attempt to explain it through arbi­ trary identification with the animal world .  It  is ,  one  might say, a Darwinism of mythical  e lective affinity  IMAGE S FROM THE REG ION OF THE  PUEBLO  INDIAN S   </page> <page sequence="20"> 20  which determines the lives of these so-called primitive  people.   The formal survival of  the hunting dance in San  Ildefonso is  obvious .  But  when we consider that the ante­ lope has bee n extinct there for more than three genera­ tions, then it may well be that we have in the antelope  dance  a t rans i t ion  to  the pure ly  demoniac  kachina   dances, the chief task of which is to  pray for a good crop  harvest .  In Oraibi, for example, there exists still today an  antelope clan, whose chief task is  weather magic .  Whereas the imitative animal dance must be under­ stood in terms of the mimic magic of hunting culture, the  kachina dances, corresponding to cyclic peasant festivals,   have a character entirely of their own which, however, is   revealed only at s ites far removed from European culture .  This cultic, magical masked dance, with its entreaties fo­ cused on inanimate nature, can be observed in its more or  les s original form only where the railroads have yet to  penetrate and where-as in the Moki villages-even the  veneer of offical Catholicism no longer exists .  The children are taught to regard the kachinas with a  deep religious awe . Every child takes the ka chinas for su­ pernatural,  terrifying creatures ,  and the moment of the  child's initiation into the nature of the kachinas,  into the  society of masked dancers itself, represents the most im­ portant turning po int in the education of  the Indian  child.  On the market square of the rock village of Oraibi ,   the most remot e westerly point,  I was lucky enough to  observe a so-called humiskachina dance . Here I saw the  living original s of the masked dancers I had already seen  in puppet form in a room of this same village of Oraibi .   To reach Oraibi,  I had to travel for two days from the  railway station of Holbrook in a small carriage . This is  a  so-called buggy with four light wheels ,  capable of ad­ vancing through desert sands where only gorse can grow.  The driver throughout my stay in the region was Frank  ABY M.

The young men were busy painting their masks for  the following day. They use their big leather helmets  again and again, as  new ones would be too costly. The  painting process involves taking water into the mouth  and then spraying it onto the leather mask as  the colors  are rubbed in.   By the following morning, the entire audience, in­ cluding two groups of children, had assembled on the  wall (Figure 14) .

Children are brought  up gently but with discipline and are very obliging, once  one has earned their trust. Now the children had as­ sembled, with earnest anticipation, on the marketplace.   These humiskachina figures with artificial heads move  them to real terror, all the more so as they have learned  from the kachina dolls of the inflexible and fearsome  qualities of the masks . Who knows whether our dolls did  not also originate as such demons?  The dance was performed by about twenty-to-thirty  male and about ten female dancers-the latter meaning  men representing female figures .

It is here  a question of establishing a bond between natural forces  and man, of creating a symbol as the connecting agent,  indeed as the magical rite that achieves integration by  sending out a mediator, in this case a tree,  more closely  bound to the earth than man, beca use it grows from the  ABY M.

As the sun was  about  to s ink,  we were presented with an astonishing  spectacle, one which showed with overwhelming clarity  how solemn and silent composure draws its magical reli­ gious forms from the very depths of elemental humanity.  In this light, our tendency to view the spiritual element  alone in such ceremonies must be rej ected as a one-sided  and paltry mode of explanation.   Six figures appeared .  Three almost completely na­ ked men smeared with yellow clay, their hair wound into  horn shapes, were dressed only in loin cloths .  Then carne  three men in women's clothes .  And while the chorus and  its priests proceeded with their dance movements, undis­ tu rbed  and  with unbroken  devot ion ,  the se  figure s   l aunched into a thoroughly vulgar and disrespectful  parody of the chorus movements . And no one laughed .   The vulgar parody was  regarded not  as comic mockery  but, rather, as a kind of peripheral contribution by the  revellers, in the effort to ensure a fruitful corn year. Any­ one familiar with ancient tragedy will see he re the duality  of tragic chorus and satyr play, " grafted onto a single  stem. " The ebb and flow of nature appears in anthropo­ morphic symbols :  not in a drawing but in the dramat ic  magical dance, actually returned to life .   The essence of magical insinuation into the divine,  into a share of its superhuman power, is  revealed in the  terrifyingly dramat ic aspect of Mexican re1igious devo­ tion. In one festival a woman is worshipped for forty  days as a corn goddess  and then sacrificed, and then the  priest slips into the skin of the poor creature . Compared  to this most elementary and frenzied attempt to approach  the divinity, what we observed among the Pueblos is  in­ deed related but infinite1y more refined. Yet there is  no  guarantee that the sap does not stil l  rise in secret from  such blood-soaked cultic roots . After all ,  the same soil  that bears the Pueblos has also witnessed the war dances  ABY M .  WARBURG  </page> <page sequence="35"> of the wild, nomadic Indians,  with their atrocities culmi- 3 5  nating in the martyrdom of the enemy.  The most extreme approximation of this magical de­ sire for unity with nature via the animal world can be  observed among the Moki Indians, in their dance with  live serpents at Oraibi and Walpi. I did not myself ob­ serve this dance,  but a few photographs will give an idea  of this most pagan of all the ceremonies of Walpi. This  dance is at once an animal dance and a religious, seasonal  dance . In it ,  the individual animal dance of San Ildefonso   and the  indivi dua l  fer t i l i ty  ri t u a l  o f  th e  O r aib i   humiskachina dance converge in  an  intense expressive ef­ fort. For in August, when the critical  moment in the till ­ ing of the soil arrives to render the entire crop harvest  contingent on rainstorms, these redemptive storms are  invoked through a dance with live serpents, celebrated  a l t e rna t e l y  in  Or aibi  and  Wa lpi . Whe r e a s  in  S a n   Ildefonso only a simulated version o f  antelope i s  visible­ at least to the uninitiated-and the corn dance achieves  the demoniac representation of corn demons only with  masks, we find here in Walpi a far more primeval aspect  of the magic dance .  Here the dancers and the live animal form a magical  unity, and the surprising thing is that the Indians have  found in these dance ceremonies a wa y of handling the  most dangerous of all animal s ,  the rattlesnake, so  that it  can be tamed without violence, so that the creature will  participate willingly-or at least without making use of  its aggressive abilities ,  unless provoked-in ceremonies  lasting for days . This would surely lead to catastrophe in  the hands of Europeans .   Two Moki clans provide the participants in the ser­ pent ceremony: the antelope and the serpent clans ,  both  of whom are folklorically and totemistically linked with  the two animals .  That totemism can be taken seriously  even today is proved here, as humans not only appear  masked as animals but enter into cultic exchange with the  IMAGES FROM THE REGION OF THE PU. EBLO INDIANS  </page> <page sequence="36"> 3 6 most dangerous beast, the live serpent. The serpent cer­ emony at Walpi thus stands between simulated, mimic  empathy and bloody sacrifice .  It involves not the imita­ tion of the animal but the bluntest engagement with it as   a ritual participant-and that not  as sacrifical victim but,  like the baho, as fellow rainmaker.  For the snakes themselves ,  the serpent dance at Walpi  is an enforced entreaty. They are caught live in the desert  in August, when the storms are imminent, and in a six­ teen-day ceremony in Walpi they are attended to in the  underground kiva by the chiefs of the serpent and ante­ lope clans in a series of unique ceremonies ,  of which the  most significant and the most astonishing for white ob­ servers is the washing of the snakes .  The snake is treated  like a novice of the mysteries ,  and notwithstanding its  resistance , its head is dipped in consecrated, medicated  water. Then it is thrown onto a sand painting done on the  kiva floor and representing four lightning snakes with a  quadruped in the middle . In another kiva a sand painting  depicts a mass of clouds from which emerge four differ­ ently colored lightning streaks ,  corresponding to the  points of the compass,  in the form of serpents .  Onto the  first sand painting, each snake is hurled with great force,  so that the drawing is obliterated and the serpent is ab­ sorbed into the sand .  I am convinced that this magic  throw is intended to force the serpent to invoke lightning  or produce rain . That is clearly the significance of the  entire ceremony, and the ceremonies that follow prove  that these consecrated serpents j oin the Indians in the  starkest manner as  provokers and petitioners of rain .  They are living rain serpent-saints in animal formo  The serpents-numbering about a hundred and in­ cluding a distinct number of genuine rattlesnakes with, as  has been ascertained, their poisonous fangs left intact­ are guarded in the kiva, and on the festival 's final  day  they are imprisoned in a bush with a band wound around  it. The ceremony culmina tes as follows : approach to the  ABY M. WARBURG  </page> <page sequence="37"> bush, seizing and carrying of the live serpents, dispatch- 3 7  ing of the snakes to the plains as  messengers . American  researchers describe the clutching of the snake as an un­ believably exciting act. It is carried out in the following  way.  A group of three approaches the serpent bush.  The  high priest of the serpent clan pulls a snake from the bush  as another Indian with painted face and tattoos,  wearing  a fox skin on his back, clutches the snake and places it in  his mouth. A companion, holding him by the shoulders,  distracts the attention of the serpent by waving a feath­ ered stick.  The third figure is the guard and the snake  catcher, in case the serpent should slip out of the second  man's mouth . The dance is played out in j ust over half an  hour on the small square at Walpi . When all the snakes  have thus been  carried for a while to the sound of   ratdes-produced by  the Indians who wear ratdes and  stone-filled tortoise shells on their knees-they are borne  by the dancers with lightning speed into the plain, where  they disappear.  From what we know of Walpi mythology, this form of  devotion certainly goes back to ancestral, cosmologic leg­ end. One saga tells the story of the hero Ti-yo, who un­ dertakes a subterranean journey to discover the sou rce of  the longed-for water. He passes the various kivas of the  princes of the underworld, always accompanied by a fe­ male spider who sits invisibly on his right ear-an ludian  Virgil, Dante 's guide to the underworld-and eventually  guides him past the two sun houses of  the West and East  into the great serpent kiva, where he receives the magic  baho that will invoke the weather. According to the saga,  Ti-yo returns from the underworld with the baho and  two serpent-maidens ,  who bear him serpentine chil­ dren-very dangerous creatures who ultimately force the  tri bes to change their dwelling place.  The serpents are  woven into this myth both as  weather deities and as  to­ tems that bring about the migration of the clans .   IMAGES FROM THE REGION OF  THE PUEBLO INDIANS  </page> <page sequence="38"> 3 8 In this snake dance the serpent is therefore not sacri- ficed but rather, through consecration and suggestive  dance mimicry, transformed into a messenger and dis­ patched, so that, returned to the souls  of the dead,  it  may  in the form of lightning produce storms from the he av­ ens . We have here an insight into the pervasiveness of  myth and magical practice among primitive humanity.  The elementary form of emotional release through Indian  magical practice may strike the layman as a characteristic  unique to primitive wildness,  of which Europe knows  nothing . And yet two thousand years ago in the very  cradle of our own European culture , in Greece, cultic  ha bits were in vogue which in crudeness and perversity  far surpass what we have seen among the Indians .  In the orgiastic cult of Dionysus ,  for example,  the  Maenads danced with snakes in one hand and wore live  serpents as diadems in their hair, holding in the other  hand the animal that was to be ripped to pieces in the  ascetic sacrificial dance in honor of the godo In contrast  to the dance of the Moki Indians of today, blood sacrifice  in a state of frenzy is the culmination and fundamental  significance of this religious dance (Figure 23 ) .   The deliverance from blood sacrifice a s  the innermost  ideal of purification pervades the history of religious evo­ lution from east to west. The serpent shares in this Pro­ cess of religious sublimation. Its role can be considered a  yardstick for the changing nature of faith from fetishism  to the pure religion of redemption.  In the Old Testament,  as in the case of the primal serpent Tiamat in Babylon,  the serpent is the spirit of evil and of temptation .  In  Greece, as well, i t  i s  the merciless ,  devouring creature of  the underworld: the Erinyes are encircled by snakes, and  when the gods mete out punishment they send a serpent  as  their executioner.  This idea of the serpent as  a destroying force from the  underworld has found its most powerful and tragic sym- ABY M. WARBURG  </page> <page sequence="39"> 3 9   Fig. 23 .  Dancing Maenad. Musée du Louvre, Paris.  bol in the myth and in the sculpted group of Laocoon.   The vengeance of  the  gods,  wrought on their priest and  on his two sons by means of a strangler serpent, becomes  in this renowned sculpture of  antiquity the manifest in­ carnation of  extreme human suffering.  The soothsaying  priest who wanted to come to the aid of  his people by  warning them of the wiles of  the Greeks falls  victim to the  revenge of  the partial gods . Thus the death of  the father  and his sons becomes a symbol  of ancÍent suffering:  death  at the hands of  vengeful demons,  without justice and  without hope of redemption.  That is  the hopeless ,  tragic  pessimism of antiquity ( Figure 24).   The serpent as the demon in the pessimistic world  lMAGES FROM THE REGlON OF THE PUEBLO lND lANS  </page> <page sequence="40"> Fig. 24. Laocoon group. Vatican Museum, Rome. Alinari/Art Resource, N.

Asclepius,  the ancient god of  healing, carries a serpent coiling around his healing staff  as a symbol (Figure 25 ) .  His features are the features car­ ried by the world savior in the plastic art of antiquity.  And this most exalted and serene god of departed souls  has his roots in the subterranean realm, where the serpent  makes its home . It is in the form of a serpent that he is  accorded his earliest devotion .  It is he himself who winds  around his staff: namely, the departed soul of  the de­ ceased, which survives and reappears in the form of the  serpent. For the snake is not only, as  Cushing's Indians  would say, the fatal bite in readiness or fulfillment, de­ stroying without merey; the snake also reveals by its own  ability to cast off its slough, slipping, as it were, out of its  own mortal remains,  how a body can leave its skin and  yet continue to live .  It can slither into the earth and re­ emerge . The return from within the earth, from where the  dead rest, along with the capacity for bodily renewal,  makes the snake the most natural symbol of immortality  and of rebirth from sickness and mortal anguish .4  In the temple of Asclepius at Kos in Asia Minor the  god stood transfigured in human form, a statue holding  in his hand the staff with the serpent coiled around it . But  his truest and most powerful essence was not revealed in  this lifeless mask of stone but lived instead in the form of  a serpent in the temple's innermost sanctum: fed, cared  for, and attended in cultic devotion as only the Mokis are  able to care for their serpents .   On a Spanish calendar leaf  from the thirteenth cen­ tury, which 1 found in a Vatican manuscript, representing  Asclepius as the ruler of the month in the sign of Scorpio,  significant aspects of the Asclepian serpent cult are re­ vealed in their coarseness as  well as their refinement (Fig­ ure 26 ) .  We can see  here ,  hieroglyphical ly indicated,   ritual acts  from the cult  of Kos in thirty sections, all iden- ABY M. WARBURG  </page> <page sequence="43"> 4 3  Fig. 26.

We see the rite of  incubation and  the serpent as it is carried by human hands and wor­ shipped as a deity of the springs .   This medieval manuscript i s  astrological . In  other  words, it shows these ritual forms not as prescriptions for  devotional practices ,  as had previously been the case;  rather, these figures have become hieroglyphs for those  IMAGES FROM THE REGION OF THE PUEBLO IND IANS  </page> <page sequence="44"> 44  born under the heavenly sign o f  Asclepius .  For Asclepius  has becom e precisely a star-deity, undergoing a transfor­ mation through an act of cosmologic imagination which  has completely deprived him of the real,  the direct sus­ ceptibility to influence, the subterranean, the lowly. As a  fixed star he stands over Scorpio in the zodiaco He is sur­ rounded by serpents and is now regarded only as  a he av­ enly body under whose influence prophets and physicians  are born. Through this elevation to the stars, the serpent­ god becomes a transfigured totem. He is the cosmic fa­ ther of those born in the month when his visibility is  highest .  In ancient astrology, mathematics and magic  converge . The serpent figure in the heavens, found also in  the constellation of the Great Serpent, is used as a math­ ematical outline; the points of luminosity are linked to­ gether by way of an earthly image, in order to render  comprehensible an infinity we cannot comprehend at all  without sorne such outline of orientation. So Asclepius is  at once a mathematical border sign and a fetish bearer.  The evolution of  culture toward the age of reason is  marked in the same measure as  the tangible, coarse tex­ ture of life ,  fading into mathematical abstraction.   About twenty years ago in the north of Germany, on  the Elbe, I found a strange example of the elementary  indestructability of the memory of the serpent cult, de­ spite all efforts of religious enlightenment; an example  that shows the path on which the pagan serpent wanders,  linking us to the pasto On an excursion to the Vierlande  [near Hamburg] , in a Protestant church in Lüdingworth,  I discovered, adorning the so-called rood screen, Bible il­ lustrations that clearly originated in an Italian illustrated  Bible and that had found their way here through the  hands of a strolling painter.  And here I suddenly spotted Laocoon with his two  sons in the terrible grasp of the serpent. How did he come  to be in this church ? But this Laocoon found his salva­ tion .  How? Looming in front of him was the staff of  ABY M.  WARBURG   </page> <page sequence="45"> Asclepius and on it a holy serpent, corresponding to what 4 5  we read in the fourth book of the Pentateuch : that Moses  had commanded the Israelites in the wilderness to heal  snakebites by setting up a brazen serpent for devotion.  We have here a remnant of idolatry in the Old Testa­ mento We know, however, that this can only be a subse­ quent insertion, intended to account retroactively for the  existence of such an idol in Jerusalem. For the principal  fact remains that a brazen serpent idol was destroyed by  King Hezekiah under the influence of the prophet Isaiah.  The prophets fought most bitterly against  idolatrous  cults  that engaged in human sacrifice and worshipped  animals,  and this struggle forms the crux of Oriental and  of Christian reform movements down to the most recent  times .  Clearly the setting up of the serpent is in starkest  contradiction to the Ten Commandments,  in sharpest op­ position to the hostility to images that essentially moti­ vates the reforming prophets .   But  there is another reason why every student of the  Bible should consider the serpent the most provocative  symbol of hostifity : the serpent on the tree in Para di se  domina tes the biblical narrative of the order of the world  as the cause of evil and of sin . In the Old and New Testa­ ments alike, the serpent clutches the tree of Paradise as   the satanic power that  summons the entire tragedy of sin­ ning humanity as well as its hope for redemption.   In the battle against pagan idolatry, early Christianity  was more uncompromising in its view of the serpent culto  In the eyes of the pagans, Paul was an impervious emis­ sary when he hurled the viper that had bitten him into the  fire without dying of the bite .  (The poisonous viper be­ longs in the fire ! )  So durable was the impression of Paul's  invulnerability to the vipers of Malta that as late as the  sixteenth century, j ugglers wound snakes around them­ selves at festivals  and fairgrounds, representing them­ selves as men of the house of Saint Paul and selling soil  from Malta as an antidote to snakebites .

In medieval theology we find the miracle o f  the bra­ zen serpent curiously retained as a part of legitimate reli­ gious devotion. Nothing attests to the indestructibility of  the animal cult as does the survival of the miracle of the  brazen serpent into the medieval Christian world view. So   lasting in  medieval theological memory was the serpent  ABY M. WARBURG  </page> <page sequence="47"> 47  Fig. 28.  Serpent and Crucifixion from Speculum humanae salvationis.

The ani­ mal image and the staff of Asclepius as reverential obj ects  for the kneeling multitude are treated and represented as  a stage,  albeit to be overcome, in humanity's quest for  lMAGES FROM THE REGlON OF THE PUEBLO lND lANS  </page> <page sequence="48"> 4 8 salvation .  In the attempt at a tripartite scheme of evolu­ tion and of the ages-that is, of Nature, Ancient Law,  and Grace-an even earlier stage in this process is the  representation of the impeded sacrifice of Isaac as an  analogue to the Crucifixion. This tripartite scheme is still  evident in the imagery adorning the minster of Salem.  In the church of Kreuzlingen itself, this evolutionary  idea has generated an astonishing parallelism, which can­ not make ready sense to the theologically uninitiated .   Here,  on the ceiling of  the  famous Mount of  O lives  chapel, immediately aboye the Crucifixion, we find an  adoration of this most pagan idol with a degree of pathos  that does not suffer in comparison with the Laocoon  group . And under the reference to the Tables of the Law,  which, as the Bible recounts, Moses destroyed because of  the worship of the golden calf, we find Moses himself,  forced into service as shield bearer to the serpent.  I shall be satisfied if these images from the everyday and  festive lives of the Pueblo Indians have convinced you  that their masked dances are not child's play, but rather  the primary pagan mode of answering the largest and  most pressing questions of the Why of things .  In this way  the Indian confronts the incomprehensibility of natural  processes with his will to comprehension, transforming  himself personally into a prime causal agent in the order  of things . For the unexplained effect, he instinctively sub­ stitutes the cause in its most tangible and visible formo  The masked dance is danced causality.  If religion signifies bonding,S then the symptom of  evolution away from this primal state is the spiritualiza­ tion of the bond between humans  and alien beings ,  so  that man no longer identifies directly with the masked  symbol but, rather, generat es that bond through thought  alone, progressing to a systematic linguistic mythology.  The will to devotional zeal is an ennobled form of the  donning of a mask.  In the process that we call cultural  ABY  M. WAR BURG   </page> <page sequence="49"> progress ,  the being exacting this devotion gradually loses 49  its monstrous concreteness and, in the end, becomes a  spiritualized, invisible symbol .  What does this mean ? In the realm of mythology the  law of the smallest unit does not hold; there is no search  for the smallest agent of rationality in the course of natu­ ral phenomena; rather, a being saturated with as  much  demoniac power as  possible is postulated for the sake of  a true grasp of  the causes  of  mysterious  occurrences .   What we have seen this evening o f  the symbolism o f  the  serpent should give us at least a cursory indication of  the  passage from a symbolism whose efficacy proceeds di­ rectly from the body and the hand to one that unfolds  only in thought. The Indians actually clutch their ser­ pents and treat them as  living agents that generate light­ ning at the same time that they represent lightning .  The  Indian takes the serpent in his mouth to bring about an  actual union of the serpent with the masked figure, or at  least with the figure painted as a serpent.  In the Bible the serpent is the cause of all evil and as  such is punished with banishment from Paradise . Never­ theless ,  the serpent s lithers back into a chapter of the  Bible itself as an indestructible pagan symbol-as a god  of healing.  In antiquity the serpent likewise represents the quin­ tessence of the most profound suffering in the death of  Laocoon.  But antiquity is capable also of transmuting the  inconceivable fertility of the serpent-deity, representing  Asclepius as a savior and as the lord of the serpent, ulti­ mately placing him-the serpent-god with the tamed ser­ pent in his hand-as a starry divinity in the heavens .   In medieval theology, the  serpent draws from this  passage in the Bible the ability to reappear as a symbol of  fate . Its elevation-though expressly considered as  an  evolutionary stage that has bee n surpassed-posits it  on  par with the Crucifixion.  In the end the serpent is an international symbolic  I MAGES FROM THE REG ION OF THE  PUEBLO INDIAN S   </page> <page sequence="50"> 5 0 answer to the question Whence come elementary destruc­ tion,  death, and suffering into the world ? We saw in  Lüdingworth how christological thought makes use of  pagan serpent imagery to express symbolically the quin­ tessence of suffering and redemption .  We might say that  where helpless  human suffering searches for redemption,  the serpent as  an image and explanation of causality can­ not be far away. The serpent deserves its own chapter in  the philosophy of " as if. "  How does humanity free itself from this enforced  bonding with a poisonous reptil e to which it attributes a  power of agency ? Our own technological age has no need  of the serpent in order to understand and control light­ ning. Lightning no longer terrifies the city dweller, who  no longer craves a benign storm as the only source of  water. He has his water supply, and the lightning serpent  is diverted straight to the ground by a lightning conduc­ tor. Scientific explanation has disposed of mythological  causation .  We know that the serpent is an animal that  must succumb, if humanity wills it to o The replacement of  mythological causation by the technological removes the  fears felt by primitive humanity. Whether this liberation  from the mythological world view is of genuine help in  providing adequate answers to the enigmas of existence is  quite another matter.  The American government, like the Catholic Church  before it, has brought modern schooling to the Indians  with remarkable energy. Its intellectual optimism has re­ sulted in the fact that the Indian children go to school in  comely suits and pinafores and no longer believe in pagan  demons . That also applies to the maj ority of educational  goals .  It may well denote progress .  But I would be loath  to assert that it does j ustice to the Indians who think in  images and to their, let us say, mythologically anchored  souls .   1 once invited the children of such a school to illus- ABY M.

With these waves,  the culture of the  machine age destroys what the natural sciences,  born of  myth, so arduously achieved :  the space for devotion,   which evolved in turn into the space required for reflec­ tion.  The modern Prometheus and the modern Icarus ,   Franklin and the Wright brothers,  who invented the diri­ gible airplane, are precisely those ominous destroyers of  the sense of distance, who threaten to lead the planet  back into chaos .   Telegram and telephone destroy the  cosmos .  Mythi­ cal and symbolic thinking strive to form spiritual bonds  between humanity and the surrounding world,  shaping  distance into the space required for devotion and reflec­ tion: the distance undone by the instantaneous electric  connection .

S . ]  In the  first draft of this  passage, Warburg explained the symbolic power of the serpent image in the  following way:  Through which qualities does the serpent appear in literature  and art as  a usurping imposter [ein verdriingender Vergleicher] ?  1. It experiences through the course of a year the full l i fe  cycle from deepest, deathlike sleep to the utmost vitality.  2 .  It changes its slough and remains the same.   3.  It is  not capable of walking on feet and remains capable  nonetheless of propell ing itself with great speed, armed with the  absolutely deadly weapon of its poisonous tooth.   4 .  It i s  minimally visible to the eye, especially when its colors  act according to the desert's laws of mimicry, or when it shoots  out from its secret holes in the earth.  5. Phallus .   These are qualities which render the serpent unforgettable as   a threatening symbol of the  ambivalent in  nature : death and l ife ,   v is ible  and invis ible ,  without prior warning and deadly on sight.   5.
