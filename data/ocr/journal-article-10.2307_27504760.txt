<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PARENTAL IMAGE. By M. Esther Harding. New York, G. P. Putnanis Sons, 296$. $6.jo. To expand consciousness by invading the chaotic territory of the unconscious and bringing it under orderly control may be called the psychic imperialism of analysis.</page><page sequence="2">The "royal road" through this strange ter rain is the dream, but the major strategy for the invasion may be either the rational-logi cal or the nonrational-mystical. The rational logical is the Occidental patriarchal ap proach; the nonrational-mystical is the Oriental matriarchal approach. The latter would penetrate the territory of the un conscious more deeply than the former. A few years ago, a cartoon ridiculing the "Bridey Murphy" craze appeared. It por trayed the subject lying on a couch and being urged by the "Bridey Murphy" ex pert to go back in his reincarnation as far as he could. Finally, the subject responded: "and after six days I rested on the seventh." Freud's strategy for conquering the uncon scious did not require going back to such an identification with the Old Testament Father-God who, Freud claimed, did not exist anyhow. For Freud, it was sufficient to turn back no further than the three-year old's incestuous conflicts. Rank went back three years further to the traumatic exit from the womb; Trigant Burrow went back nine months more to the preconscious mode of the amniotic condition. Since for the Jungians the unconscious is more ex tensive, being more collective than individ ualistic, they go further back than even the Old Testament God, for they also struggle with the matriarchal powers of a goddess who, they claim, preceded Him. In all psychoanalytic schools it is the actual pa rental image that conditions the child; but the Jungians appear to emphasize more strongly the effect of the mother. This is the emphasis in The Parental Image by Dr. Harding, a leading Jungian analyst. Her thesis is that when the anal ysand achieves successful emancipation from his real parents, he must at the same time also win freedom from the archetype of the pre-biblical great mother goddess in order to become a whole person. The whole person, or the self, is the goal higher, happier, and therefore more desir able than mere ego-consciousness and, ac cording to Dr. Harding, this goal can be attained only by uncovering the self beneath the layers of dream material that are anal agous to the most ancient mythologies. As her starting point, therefore, Dr. Harding goes back to the pre-biblical Babylonian myth in which the devouring mother god dess, Tiamat, ruled over chaos at the be ginning. She was finally overcome by the male hero-god, Marduk, who was com missioned by his father-god, Apsu, to at tempt the awesome feat. The successful Marduk then had to keep his fellow gods in their orderly places. For this purpose, Marduk created man who, by ritualistic worship, would keep these gods satisfied. Dr. Harding correlates this mythologem with her account of two patients, one male and one female. Both drew pictures of their dreams, illustrated in the book, which Hard ing relates to the Babylonian myth. From this she draws the conclusion that man to day can bring conscious order out of his own unconscious chaos only by a revival of religious fealty to the numinous in life here made identifiable by a mythological arche type. She applies this conclusion not merely to the individual, but also to international affairs. Dr. Harding is impressive though rep etitious when she writes of the deleterious effect of injured parental images on the child rejected by real parents and of this child's need to be freed from such dam aging authorities. But her clear line of thought becomes obfuscated when it is carried over into the hypothesis of emanci pation from primal archetypes. This lack of clarity may stem from Dr. Harding's involved sentence structure or may be clearer to those accustomed to the Jungian mystical style. I make this critical observa tion even though I agree that replacing un loving parents with the image of a loving God may have therapeutic value. The re ligious factor may take priority over the Book Reviews 467</page><page sequence="3">sexual, especially after middle age, in the emancipation of the self, but missing in Dr. Harding's account of her two cases is a full description of their sexual histories. Lacking this, one cannot be sure what, for example, the dead cock in the dream of Harding's female patient does reveal. Hard ing says the dead cock represents i) the resolution of the earthly and the spiritual after death, since a friend sacrificed a cock for Socrates just before the latter's death, 2) lust in Hindu symbolism, and 3) a re birth for the female patient because the cock's crow heralds a new day. How a dead cock can crow is not explained. How ever, since Dr. Harding throughout the book addresses herself less to the problems of childhood and more to the problems of middle age (as Jungians do in contrast to the Freudians), it could be that for her fe male patient a dead cock does mean an im mortality unsullied by sexuality. This is one example of combining too much in a sym bol, which leads to an oversimplification of Egyptian and Greek mysteries, Christian mysticism, astrology, and Jewish cabbala to which Dr. Harding makes frequent refer ences. Much more investigation in my thology will have to be done before the correlation between the sexual and the mys tical, between the erotic and the esoteric can be so functionally applied in therapy. If Tiamat is the mother archetype, then it certainly is more important to be free from one's mother than from one's father. Dr. Harding describes the destructive, de vouring mother goddess Tiamat as "dan gerous" though "necessary" and "the source of the emotions" and "the aspect of life that has remained the most uncontrollable and capricious, the most prone to drive hu mankind into destructive outbreaks that do not accord at all with his more civilized and disciplined masculine way." This may sound like an antifeminine bias, even though Dr. Harding is a woman; but her subjective in terpretation of the Babylonian myth does 468 Journal of Religion and Health not necessarily have any basis in fact. Freud's caution that "manifest content is made so unlike the latent thought that no body would suspect the latter behind the former" applies here. May not the Baby lonian myth be a patriarchal fabrication deliberately designed to devaluate the su periority of the loving female of an earlier matriarchal age? According to a male ex pert on myths, Joseph Campbell, Tiamat was made to look terrible in the Babylonian cosmology in order to justify the real Ori ental tyrants. Campbell, a mystical hu manist, would have his readers believe that the initiates of the original loving mother goddess were in fact more civilizing and peaceful than the followers of the later Father God who replaced her. Harding says the original female goddess was hate ful, and Campbell says she was loving. In the psychology of the unconscious, ontog eny may recapitulate phylogeny; but is it to be a male or a female phylogeny, and is not the difference related to the sex of the observer? It may be that the biblical writers who deliberately reconstructed these ancient myths were more objective than either the female Harding or the male Campbell. They, too, struggled with the sex of God. Limited by their anthropomorphic lan guage, they called him Father; but in mak ing him the One and the Only, the One not divided into opposites, they removed from their God both the masculine and the fem inine bias. (The Father God is yet "like unto a mother who comforteth her chil dren.") This biblical God did not need a substitute male hero-god like Marduk to subdue the awful mother, Tiamat. He alone brought order out of the chaos of the deeps (the Hebrew word for "deeps" is tehom related to Tiamat, but in the Bible a sub stance and not a goddess, since to the bibli cal reformers there could be only one God). The biblical God assumed for Him self attributes formerly associated with</page><page sequence="4">either the male or the female and became the God of both masculine justice and fem inine mercy. Created in this God's image, the biblical hero does not conquer God. He conquers that which in himself is un just-antimasculine and unloving-antifemi nine. There would be less need for Dr. Harding's or any analyst's patients to be freed from parents as well as less need to "appease" (her word) quarreling primal archetypal parents if the parental images were transmitted to the child by the actual mother and father and both were loving as well as just parents, for no person can be completely freed from his real parents.
