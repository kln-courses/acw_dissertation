Dove-Deities of Alesia The rich iconography of Celtic religion, during its survival in Roman Gaul, presents few monuments more remarkable than the well-known sculptured groups of the Dove-Deity of Alesia (Alise-Sainte-Reine, Cote-d'Or)1. The four scul- ptures2, discovered on the Mont Auxois at Alesia in 1903, 1907 (two), and 1925 respectively, show (figs. 1, 2) the bust of a god bearing on his shoulders two doves, perched on either side, which turn their beaks inwards and appear to convey a message into his ears. A fifth example3 was dis- covered in 1931 during the excavations at Alesia of the late M. le commandant Espérandieu, together with the unique statuette relating to the Dove-Deity (fig; 8) which we shall consider in detail later. ii.

The best and most recent example of these groups is illustrated in fig. 73. In Morilasgus , however, we have an important local deity of Alesia, whose temple4 on the Mont Auxois was found by the late Commandant Espérandieu Fig. 5. - Sault : Espérandieu, I, 306. in 1909 ; who was definitely the deity of the springs ; and who was assimilated to Apollo in inscriptions (Apollo Moritas- gus). Moreover5, just as it is natural to suppose that the sculptured groups of a god and goddess represent Ucuetis and Bergusia, so it is not unreasonable (nothing being known of Alisanus, to whom, moreover, no inscription has been found yet at Alesia itself) to look for some connection bet- ween the obviously important local spring-deity Moritasgus and the remarquable sculptures of the dove-deity.

(iv) Identification of the otherwise aniconic spring-deity Moritasgus with the anonymous dove-deity We would support this identification for the reason that a close and intimate relation subsists between doves and springs ; as is clear from the following facts : (a) Six groups of votive doves4 were dedicated to the Dea J anuaria in the sanctuary of Beire-le-Châtel, near Dijon5 ; and the Dea J anuaria was almost certainly a spring-goddess, as Dr Drioux admits : « On remarque pourtant qu'à Beire, Januaria semble bien, elle aussi, être en rapport avec les sources. Le temple était bâti à proximité de plusieurs sources dont quelques-unes sont actuellement taries ; et, d'ailleurs, les divinités qui s'y donnaient rendçz-vous sont bien celles qui, si souvent, se retrouvent en pareilles circons- tances : taureau à trois cornes, Apollon, Vénus anadyomène.

The story runs also otherwise : Jupiter once gave to his daughter Hebe two doves , which spoke with a human voice , one of which flew to the oak-grove of Dodona in Epirus, and there came to rest on the tallest tree. There the oracle of Jupiter was esta- blished », etc. In this note Servius makes it clear that at Dodona the oracles of Zeus, the god of the oak, who there was especially a spring-deity Nocïoç1, were delivered in two ways : (a) by a spring f« fons ... suo murmure ... oracula reddebal r&gt;) and (b) by one of two oracular and prophetic doves which spoke with a human voice f« duas columbas , humanam vocem edentes » )2. Thus, the connection between springs and doves is immediately clear : both are the instruments of the god : both springs and doves serve the same function of trans- mitting the oracular voice of the godhead. Thus, on the analogy of Dodona, where Zeus was not only an oak and spring-deity but also a dove-deity3, a strong presumption is raised that at Alesia (where we also find a spring-deity and a dove-deity) Moritasgus the spring-deitywas, like Zeus Ndcïoç at Dodona," also a dove-deity.

Accepting, then this interpretation that the otherwise aniconic spring-deity Moritasgus, and the anonymous dove-deity are identical, the name of the latter will accordingly be that of the former. The name of the anonymous dove-deity is therefore Moritasgus. II. Interpretation of unique monument of Dove-deity RECENTLY DISCOVERED AT ALESIA BY THE LATE COMMANDANT ESPÉRANDIEU Moritasgus, spring-and dove-deity of Alesia, previously identified with Apollo (Apollo Moritasgus) is here further syncretized with some chthonian god. (i) Discovery of unique statuette of Dove-Deity During the excavations conducted by the late M . le Comman- dant Espérandieu on the Mont Auxois at Alesia in Septem- ber 1931 a remarkable and unique monument of the Dove-Deity was brought to light (together with an example of the ordi- nary type, cited above as the fifth of its kind). This unique statuette (fig. 8) (of fine, white stone, height 0 m. 34) was found at La Fandrolle at the foot of a wall at á depth of less than half-a-metre. By the kind permission of the late Commandant Espéràndieu I am allowed to republish the statuette, which he has already published with a brief commentary2.

We know that the spring - (and dove-) - deity Moritasgus, had already been identified with Apollo ( Apollo Moritasgus)1 ; but what is the name of the chthonian god with whom we find the dove-deity associated in our statuette ? Before answering this question however, we must briefly first consider the objection which this very statuette has raised in the mind of the late Espérandieu himself2 against his own original conjecture that the dove-deity of Alesia was identical with the spring-deity Moritasgus. (iii) Reply to objection against identification of dove-deity with Moritasgus Moritasgus, the late Espérandieu emphasises, was assimila- ted to Apollo (Apollo Moritasgus) : « La croyance gallo-romaine avait fait de ce dieu un Apollon. » Therefore, if the dove- deity and spring-deity Moritasgus are identical, our statuette of the dove-deity should show his attributes, the two doves, associated with Apollo . But our statuette clearly does not represent an Apollo, but rather some chthonian god. M. Espé- randieu therefore considered that his original identification of the dove-deity with Moritasgus was erroneous, and that the name of the former must be either Alisanus or Ucuetis : « Il semblerait par suite qu'on ne pût avoir le choix qu'entre Alisanus, dieu topique, et Ucuetis. » But that there is nothing inherently impossible in one deity (e. g. Moritasgus) of the vague and ill-defined Celtic pantheon being assimilated 1. Ann . épigr ., 1910, n° 121. 2. C. R. Acad.

Reinach2 summarized thus : 1 2 Esus = Mars Esus = Mercury Teutates = Mercury Teutates = Mars Taranis = Jupiter Taranis = Dispater That such confusion is possible is eloquent of the uncertain character of Celtic deities, who could thus be identified with more than one classical god. In Britain, also, we find that Cocidius, for example, who was generally identified with Mars (Mars Cocidius), was also assimilated to Silvanus (C. I. L., VII, 642 : « Deo Silvano Cocidio »). Therefore the assimilation of Moritasgus also to two classical deities (Apollo and some chthonian god) is in no way impossible. (iv) Is the chthonian god (of the new statuette at Alesia) the Graeco-Roman Hades-Pluto or the Graeco-Egyptian Serapis ? But to return to our statuette, the doves must be the oracular doves of Moritasgus, and we may now consider the question, Who is the deity with whom Moritasgus is here associated ? Our choice, as we have indicated above, is clearly delimited . to a chthonian god by the presence of the three-headed Cerberus and the calathus, modiús, or polos on the god- head, both attributes being peculiar to the infernal powers. 1.

But which deity is here intended ? For the following reasons we answer Serapis : 1) On the monument of Nevers (fig. 4)3 the oracular bird-deity - - possibly even a « dieu aux colombes » - is associated with the « dieu au maillet » (seated within the « édicule » in the front of the monument ; not here illustra- ted). One reason for this association of bird-deity and « dieu au maillet » is, perhaps, that the bird-deity is, ipso facto, also a tree-spirit, « génie des taillis marécageux, où foisonnent les volatiles de toute espèce4 », and naturally co-habits with » another tree-spirit ; for the « dieu au maillet » (like Silvanus, « sacra semiclusus fraxino5 ») is indeed at times a tree-spirit, « adossé », in the monuments of Saint-Révérien and Vichy6, « à un arbre ». But the « dieu au maillet », in the opinion of Grivaud de La Vincelle and the late Salomon Reinach7, was the representation of the supreme divinity of the Celts, the chthonian Dis Pater, from whom they traced their descent, ' as mentionned by Caesar8. Recently, this identification of the « dieu au maillet » with the Celtic Dis Pater has been 1. Rev. des Musées , I.e. 2. In litt., 11, XII, 32. 3. Espérandieu, III, 2208 ; cf. A.

Linckenheld1, who shows for example that, in the territory of the « dieu au maillet », Dis Pater is unknown, and vice-versa2. Accep- ting this interpretation that the « Dieu au maillet » == Dis Pater, we^are reminded further that - just as the « orbis alius »3 of Celtic eschatology resembled the Egyptian rather than the classical conception (being « a place not of gloom and suffering, but of light and liberation4 ») - so Dis Pater was akin, not to the Graeco-Roman Pluto, but to the Graeco- Egyptian Serapls. In the words of S. Reinach, « les Gaulois, pour figurer leur Dis Pater, ont imité le type hellénique de Jupiter Sérapis, tout en introduisant quelques modifications dans ses attributs », and again « les artistes gallo-romains voulant figurer un dieu dont la conception tenait une si grande place dans la religion gauloise, ont imité le type alexandrin de Sérapis qui: répondait à une idée analogue5 ». ' Thus we may speak of the « identité du dieu au maillet avec Sérapis » (S. Reinach)6, and from this it is legitimate to conclude that on the monument of Nevers (fig. 4) the bird- deity, being associated with the « dieu au maillet », is thus associated with the chthonian Dis Pater-Serapis ; 2) But the dove-goddess Januaria of Beire-le-Châtel, already mentionned above, was also connected with the « dieu au maillet » (i. e. Dis Pater-Serapis), for amongst her votive doves was found the head of a mallet7, « avec trou pour remplacement d'un manche8 ». 1. E. Linckenheld, Sucellus et Nantosvelta ( R . H.

This conclusion, moreover, is confirmed by a parallel instance of association in the Rhine valley. For 3) at Cologne Serapis was again associated with the local deity, as we see from the dedication : « I. O. M. ET SERAPI ET GENIO LOCI1. » For these reasons, then, we conclude that the chthonian deity syncretized with Moritasgus, the spring- and dove-deity of Alesia, deus ipse loci fluvio Moritasgus amoeno 2, is not Pluto but Serapls. The new statuette of Alesia represents Serapis Moritasgus . III. But why was Moritasgus THE SPRING- AND DOVE-DEITY, ALREADY ASSIMILATED TO APOLLO (APOLLO MORITASGUS), NOW FURTHER SYNCRETIZED WITH SERAPIS (Serapis Moritasgus) ? To this question there are several supplementary answers. (1) In the first place, Moritasgus in his character of spring- and dove-deity resembled the supreme divinity of the Hellenic 1.

And this resemblance between Moritasgus and Zeus is strikingly shown by the representation of Zeus 'Aoxpaïoç at Halicarnassus (fig. 9), where the imperial coins portray the latter as a bearded god crowned with rays, standing between two oak-trees, on each of which is a bird1. « The two birds which », as Head remarks2, are clearly oracu- lar », and probably doves, are turned towards Zeus in the identical attitude of the doves of Moritasgus. Again, in our statuette, the sacred oak-branches8 bearing the doves, remind us further that the dove-deity (Moritasgus) was, ipso facto, also a tree-deity, who appears here as an oak- spirit4. For, as M. Toutain points out, « la divinité aux oiseaux se rattache à la fois aux génies de la végétation arborescente et aux génies des sources, des étangs, des mares, des régions humides »5. Thus, Moritasgus of Alesia is exactly analogous to Zeus of Dodona® : both are spring-, dove-, and oak-deities. M. Toutain, moreover, has observed that the « physionomie (of the dove-deity) rappelle celle du Jupiter gréco-romain7 ». Nor is this at all unnatural, for 1. Brit. Mus . Cat Gk. Coins , Caria, p.

Suidas, ÛTjxoç 6 xal Zeùç) the wood-pecker deity, who in human form wore a wood-pecker on his head.

G. Frazer. The author of the Golden Bough who, later in the same passage, speaks of the « resemblances between ancient Gaul and Latium » says : « We can hardly doubt that of old every Latin town or settlement had its own Jupiter, as every town and almost every church in modern Italy has its own Madonna ; and like the Baal of the Semites the local Jupiter was commonly worshipped on high places1 ». (Cf. Temple of Moritasgus on the Mont Auxois.) Finally there is a still further identity between Moritasgus and Zeus of Dodona, which arises out of their oracular nature. Both Moritasgus and Zeus, that is to say, are essen- tially chlhonian gods, for « the giving of oracles was a chthonian prerogative2 ». An oracular Zeus, as the late Dr L. R. Farnell has pointed out3, may always be taken to imply a chthonian Zeus4. This « telluric character » of Zeus at Dodona is well brought out by Creuzer : « Ganz auffallend zeigt sich in diesem Dodonaischen Dienste ein gewisse tellurischer cha- rakter. Dieser Juppiter war auch mit Aidoneus oder mit dem König der Unterwelt ein und derselbe5. » Thus, the exact parallel between Moritasgus, the local Jupiter of Alesia, and Zeus of Dodona saute aux yeux : Moritasgus ' / Zeus Náioç spring-deity j v spring-deity dove-deity &gt; = &lt; dove-deity oak-deity ' I oak-deity oracular(=chthonian) deity ] ' oracular ( = chthonian) deity 1.

D., the attempt would be made to assimilate Moritasgus, the local chthonian Jupiter of Alesia, to the supreme classical divinity (Zeus - Jupiter) who, in his chthonian aspect, is Pluto. But since the supreme divinity of the Celts, the chthonian Dis Pater (with whom bird-gods, as shown above, were already associated), was identical with Serapis, under this influence Moritasgus would be assimilated not to the Graeco-Roman, but to the Graeco- Egyptian, chthonian embodiment of Zeus-Jupiter i. e. to Serapis (and not to Pluto). This choice of the chthonian Serapis would be confirmed, moreover, by the following considerations : (2) We have noticed above that the Italian Picus, the wood-pecker god who, in human form, was « a personalized bird1 », and wore a wood-pecker ' on his head, was analo- gous both to Moritasgus and to Zeus, with whom, in fact, Suidas identifies him (ÛYjxoç ó xaì Zeúç). The oak, as Rendel Harris expresses it, was the « animistic repository of thunder and the dwelling-place of Zeus ; and the wood- pecker who nested in the [oak or hammered at its bark was none other than Zeus himself2 ». Picus, then, being identical with Zeus, is brought thus into relation with Mori- tasgus of Alesia (Moritasgus = Zeus of Dodona ; Picus = Zeus of Dodona ; Moritasgus = Picus). But another tradition asserts that Picus was identified with Serapis . This is contained in an interpolation (probably derived from Sextus Julius Africanus, a Christian traveller and historian of the third century) in the Excerpta Latina barbari (fol. 20 6., 26 sqq.)3, which runs, in vulgar Latin, as follows : « Post 1.

(3) Again, Herodotus, in his account of the founding of the oracles at Dodona and in Lybia, has an important variant from the version of Servius. He says that two black doves flew from Egyptian Thebes , one to Libya and one to Dodona 8ÓO 7reXeiá§aç [xeXávocç ex ©Yjêécov twv Aiyu^Tiécov áva7rra[jtivaç, ty)v (xèv ocuxecov èç Aiêúyjv, tt]v Sè 7rapà acpéaç (i. e.

We suggest that this tradition of the Egyptian origin of the oracular doves of Dodona was known at the analogous oracle of the dove-deity at Alesia ; and that some such similar tra- dition and legend perhaps existed in Gaul, and played an influential part, during the age of religious syncretism, in favouring the appropriate assimilation of the dove-deity, the local deity of Alesia, with the Egyptian Serapls. Although these would be the main reasons for the syncre- tism of Moritasgus with Serapis, yet such assimilation would be rendered easier by the realization of the devotees that Serapis - a many-sided divinity - was not only a bene- volent chthonian god, 7rpãoç xai (xeíXt^oç, as the Emperor 1. It must, however, be pointed out that the rest of the passage contains other identifications of Picus : « Alii aulem Dia Olympium , celeri autem Plutea Aidonium et alii Chlhonium Posidona. » We are told in the same account that the wife of Picus was Semiramis : « Uxor autem eius Semiramis mulier fuit maligne et praesumens et inpudica. » The fact that Semiramis was turned into a dove, as Diodorus tells us (II, 14-20), is perhaps relevant to our connection between Picus and Moritasgus. In the great temple at Hierapolis (Bambyce, Mabbog) her statue was shown with a golden dove on her head (Lucían, De Dea Syria , 33, 39). See F. Lenormant, La Légende de Sémiramis (1873) ; Q. H.

Cult and representations of Serapis in Gaul The cult of Serapis, which extended as far as Britain1, and together with that of Isis and Horus was extensive in Narbonensis and the Germanies2, has not left many traces in the Tres Galliae3. But the general popularity of Serapis in Gaul is attested by the legend on the coins of Postumus « SERAPIDI COM IT I AUGUSTI 4 ». Of the two types of representations of Serapis - seated or standing - the standing Serapis, says Michaelis, « in Roman times better answered the need of his believers to represent their god as at once a benevolent and an omnipotent lord of the universe5 ». Of this type the classical conception is pertinent at this point : a La ville ďAlésia possède, dans les temps romains, un temple élevé au dieu Moritasgus (G. I. L., XI II, 2873) : je suis porté à croire que ce nom est celui ďun roi passé à Vêlai divin. » Cf. Caesar, V, 54, 2. : The king of the Senones, on Caesar's first arrival in Gaul, was a Moritasgus. 1.
