<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PECULIAR GIFTS OF PATRICK WHITE Lyndon Harries The critical reception of the novels by Patrick White, the Australian winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1973, has been documen- ted by Alan Lawson.l Lawson is right in stating that, with very few exceptions, only in Australia has White's work received continuing attention. The Australian literary critics have maintained a dialogue in which White himself has sometimes taken part. Anyone wishing to enter more deeply into the strange, sad/comic world of White's novels should consult the Australian literary journals, especially two jour- nals with a consistently high standard, Meanjin Quarterly and Souther- ly. An account of the history and general contents of both journals has been written by A. M. Gibbs.2 There are some good general discussions of White's fictional prose in the general surveys of Australian literature,3 but separate books on White as a writer are still very few in number. The most recent is Peter Beatson's The Eye of the Mandala, which was written "for those who have been intrigued and baffled by the non-rational elements in White's books, and who find it useful to have some kind of guiding 1Alan Lawson, "Unmerciful Dingoes?

White himself indicated to Beatson the works of religious philosophy that he found congenial, but this is not the same, of course, as establishing from the corpus a religious pattern directly deriving from it. White is a writer for whom such terms as "religious," "mystical," and "theological," have to be radically qualified. This was emphasized in a review by John Colmer of a book by a Canadian scholar, Patricia A. Morley, entitled The Mystery of Unity.5 The opening sentence of Morley's book states: "The view of man and his world which underlies White's novels is religious in its basic orientation." Colmer objected to this statement on the grounds that "the view we are properly concerned with as readers and critics is that which is actually embodied in the novels."6 In the interesting discussions by both Morley and Beatson there is a strong tendency to assemble evidence from other writers rather than from White's work in order to extrapolate a religious pattern. There are radical differences in temper, tone, and spirit between the secular humanism of White's fictional prose and the writings of Christian and Jewish mystics. Colmer noted the absence of the spirit of joy in the overall texture of White's novels. Hal Porter has noted that White appears "to find repugnant those he has created, and to throw humanity less to the forces of time and circumstance than into a bottomless pit of his own digging." There is truth in Porter's comment that the effect of White's attitude toward the grotesque events he narrates is ultimately "narcotic," that "we are worked upon to feel less than we should, to pass by on the other side."7 In a letter quoted in Beatson's book, White himself wrote: "I suppose what I am increasingly intent on trying to do in my books is to give professed unbelievers glimpses of their own unprofessed factor.

This is a strange declaration of intent. Has so much talent been expended for the kind of people who are unduly sensitive about their own status as intellectuals? If what White wants is that the reader, intellectual or not, should at least be able to understand and be in sympathy with the characters he creates, it must be said that he has not made things easy for his readers. His central characters, the "burnt ones," are emotionally damaged people who lead lonely lives with no lifeline connecting them to others. He seeks to find for them a compensating value that might give their lives some significance, either a richer life in the imagination or some visionary quality. The compensation is an end in itself, and not a consequence or an element of religious experience as normally perceived. White's novels give intellectual stimulus rather than religious inspiration, no matter how religion is conceived. For professed believers of any of the great religions, Western or Eastern, White's "religious factor" as portrayed in his novels is bound to be intellec- tually troubling. At times it is trite, static, and derivative, or else it is so enigmatic that only the intellectuals are likely to derive any satisfaction from it by exercising their talents in seeking possible interpretations. In spite of his intention to bring glimpses of the religious factor to unbelievers, we suspect that he himself is among their number. The religious factor he seeks to promote is so unclear that it may be an expression of his own skepticism. Each of his principal characters bears such unholy resemblances to the others that White himself may be in each one of them. When Laura Trevelyan in Voss claims to see how man may be reconciled to the omnipotence of God, she says, "When man is truly humbled, when he has learned that he is not God, then he is nearest to becoming so. In the end he may ascend."8 D. R. Burns has commented about this glimpse of the religious factor as follows: "This does not seem revealing. It seems a simplifying. It means presumably, that one ascends by descending. To anyone who has read the Sermon on the Mount, it will seem rather a facile summary of Christ's teachings.

WHITE j 461</page><page sequence="4">In what is generally regarded as White's greatest work of fiction, The Tree of Man, the central figure, Stan Parker, finds himself just before he dies at the center of a cosmic mandala, a strange experience for an uncommunicative farmer with no previous mystical longings. We have to presume that God, who is not mentioned as a constituent of the mandala, is relegated to the last outer circle: "It was perfectly obvious that the man was seated at the heart of it."o10 Then comes what for White is obviously an important event, because he says that the old man was "illuminated." In response to the question from a passing evangelist, "Don't you believe in God, then?", Stan points with his stick at a gob of his own spittle, and replies, "That is God" (p. 495). This is the kind of Delphic utterance beloved of the critics. Lawson has faulted the critics for their excessive interpretive reliance on the oracular statements with which White liberally endows each of his novels.11 Most of the critics represent this utterance by the old man as White's recognition that divinity is immanent. Some debate whether it is also a recognition of divine transcendence.12 Whatever it may mean to White, Leonie Kramer has suggested that Stan Parker himself dis- covers neither the immanence nor the transcendence of God, but only God's irrelevance: "Stan's instinct tells him that the stones and ants he knows so well [and, we may presume, his own spittle] are real; to ask for a divine guarantor of their reality is to see them as contingent. Once he rids himself of God, the obstacle to his faith in the primary reality of objects, he is able to see the world truly, and to believe in it. "13 Only after spitting out God is Parker able to see the unity of all created things, and then only through the intervention of the author, rather than from any assertion natural to the character he has created. White does not ascribe to Stan the crucial words: "One, and no other figure, is the answer to all sums" (p. 497). It is another Delphic utterance, and it is White's, not Parker's. Of him the author writes earlier in the book: "He did not feel the necessity to translate his own life into brave words. His life as lived was enough" (p. 29).

On this point, at least, one feels that Parker would have rejected his author as readily as he appears to reject God. Probably due to the influence of this much-discussed scene, critics have emphasized White's vision of unity, excusing the many images that tend to arouse physical revulsion and an apparent obsession with ugliness and filth, especially in The Vivisector (1970), as a vision of the ultimate oneness of all matter. A more skeptical reader might see it somewhat differently and say that White has a genuine perception of duality combined with an unrealized vision of unity. Thomson's dictum that "every novel that he [White] writes is the same novel"14 is plainly an exaggeration. It is true that the central characters in each of White's novels are strange souls who do not participate willingly or happily in the life of society. They are lost souls, but not in the theological sense usually associated with the word "lost." They are alienated from mankind and respond rather to an undefined suprasocial order of things, reaching always towards the uncircumscribed. For them to be discussed in religious terms, it would be necessary to understand what is meant by the terms we were to use. We should not, as Beatson does, appropriate such terms as "redemp- tion" and "grace" without some qualification. Neither the upward strivings of those who have been "stroked by God," nor their passive waiting to be filled with some sort of awareness, results in any apparent advantage for themselves or for anybody else. It is not surprising that the question has already been raised why White should have exercised his exceptional talents upon lives so invested with the stuff of defeat.15 A believer cannot fail to think that the religious factor, as it is normally understood, might have produced happier and more meaningful results. White has a gift for creating unsympathetic characters. For this reason he can never be a popular writer. Some reviewers have not hidden their dislike for his work. For instance, the TLS review of Voss was as unsympathetic as White's own characters.16 Ross Campbell 14A. K.

WHITE 463</page><page sequence="6">wrote in the Sydney Daily Telegraph: "There is more to it [Voss] but I don't want to find out."17 Kylie Tennant in another Sydney paper admitted that "when the book strikes off into the deserts of mysticism I ... would sooner slink off home."18 But even where the dislike has been duly registered, most reviewers attempt an evaluation of some aspect of the writing. They find it impossible to dismiss the author completely. John McClaren, who maintains that White's central concern is with the inner and individual life of man and with the solitary individual, considers that "the instrument by which White leads us to an acceptance of his interpretations of events is his style."19 Some readers have disliked White's style intensely, and yet they admit that it harmonizes with theme and character. Angus Wilson identified "formal banality" and "linguistic inflation" in White's writing,20 and A. D. Hope described White's prose as "pretentious and illiterate verbal sludge."21 This did not prevent them from admiring White's novels, for Wilson considered that "White is of such stature as to demand vigorous criticism," and Hope described The Tree of Man as a novel which "shows something more fundamental than mere plot is capable of revealing . . . the extraordinary behind the ordinary." Hal Porter has maintained that White's style tends to mesmerize the reader into an acceptance of what is not established in the story. He has referred to White's published admission that he agonizes over the motjuste, rewriting and burnishing, with the result that, according to Porter, "he [White] would seem to possess the very special skill of making art that conceals art not quite conceal it."22 A feature of White's style is that the reader is constantly led to believe that under the surface there lies a further meaning which is about to be revealed. This has been well illustrated by Peter Wood, who refers to the reader's sense of the imponderables, of issues and emotions that are difficult to pin down to the words on the page, "substitutes that vaguely conjure up, rather than concretely enact. "23 17Sydney Daily Telegraph, 15 Feb. 1958, p. 18. 18Sydney Morning Herald, 8 Feb. 1958, p. 12. 19John McClaren, "The Image of Reality in Our Writing," in Twentieth Century Literary Criticism, ed.

The reader is free to supply his own interpreta- tion, even if only at the level of thinking, "Well, this must be what he means, because this is what the tendency of the story seems to suggest." But this peculiar gift has its own dangers. McClaren has written: Each character is an element in a novel, and as such exists only to the extent that he is understood by the reader. Therefore the reader must understand exactly in what sense any particular character requires a given piece of knowledge, and exactly how this piece of knowledge makes his life bearable, understandable and coherent. It is this understanding which White denies his readers. His imagery perfectly conveys the impression of an exalted state of feeling, but it does not relate this feeling to the problems which he has previously posed for his characters.24 Margaret Walters also has maintained that White fails to convey the imputed mystic significance of his episodes, avoiding their full human reality: "the transcendent parallels are a way of escaping the full brunt of human issues. "25 McLaren sees these faults as least crippling in The Tree of Man, about which he writes as follows: Here the images arise naturally from the characters' lives, and the sense of loneliness is defined in terms of what actually happens to Stan and Amy, and what they think about it. The dominant characteristic of the later novels is foreshadowed in the vision Stan is granted before his death, which is typically numinous and vague. But the resolution of the novel, suggesting life rolling forward despite all, is both more conventional and more concrete than anything in the later books. Presumably it no longer agrees with White's understanding, but artistically it is completely satisfactory; it leaves the reader to place his own value on it, without suggesting that there is any more to it than the actual fact.26 In a very interesting article by A. A. Phillips,27 White is criticized for his diagrammatic and excessive use of symbols and images, but 24John McClaren, "Patrick White's Use of Imagery," in Semmler, Twentieth Century Australian Literary Criticism, p. 269. 25Margaret Walters, "Patrick White," New Left Review, No. 18 (Jan.-Feb. 1963), p. 50. 26John McClaren, in Semmler, Twentieth Century Australian Literary Criticism, p. 239. 27A. A. Phillips, "Patrick White and the Algebraic Symbol," Meanjin Quarterly, WHITE 1 465</page><page sequence="8">even here White has his defenders-especially Sylvia Gzell28-who write at length attempting to interpret both symbol and image. The enigmatic nature of White's writing gives ample opportunity for making educated guesses as to the author's intention. It must have been somewhat disconcerting to at least some of his interpreters to find themselves referred to by White as "those indefatigable unravel- lers" engaged in "this awful symbol business." In an interview he has acknowledged having in some instances a central symbol, such as the Chariot or the Mandala, but asserts that any further symbols that "crop up" as he goes along are more often than not unconscious: "In their pursuit of symbols many academic critics don't seem to realise that writers and painters often make use of images and situations from real life because they have appealed to them as being beautiful or comic or bizarre."29 The correlation of "painters" with "writers" is an indication of how White sees himself, as a painter in words. He has stated: "I find words frustrating as I sit year in year out reeling out an endless grey. I try to splurge a bit of colour-perhaps to get a sudden impact-as a painter squeezes a tube. But there isn't the physical relief a painter experiences in the act of painting. I wish I had been a painter or composer. Or I might have been able to solve my problems as a poet. "30 This statement is sometimes introduced by the critics in support of the view that White is consciously attempting to make the novel perform new functions, to claim for it territory once the exclusive possession of the poet. There can be little doubt that his manner of writing naturally leads to such a viewpoint, particularly because he succeeds in that psychic area which is not strictly bounded by the exigencies of structure and plot. As A. A. Phillips put it, White has added to the psychic population. White is truly a painter in words. No one can deny the surface richness of his best writing, marked by the most perfect choice of words, by keen observation of the physical world, and by a careful regard for detail. This skill is matched by his driving imagination. For him the texture is everything. His imagination is what D. R. Burns 24, No. 4 (1965), 455-61; reprinted in Keesing, Australian Postwar Novelists, pp. 183-90. 28Sylvia Gzell, "Themes and Imagery in Voss and Riders in the Chariot," in Semmler, Twentieth Century Australian Literary Criticism, pp. 252-67. 29See "A Conversation with Patrick White," Southerly, No. 2 (1973), p. 140. 30Ibid., pp. 138-39. 466 5 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="9">calls the "intrinsic driving force" that is felt in all of the major works, The Aunt's Story (1948), The Tree of Man (1956), Voss (1957), and Riders in the Chariot (1961). Without this force, the writing becomes heavily Victorian, prosaic, ddjj vu, as in the first hundred pages of White's most recent novel, A Fringe of Leaves (1976). The richness of surface in the major works is of a sort that White's great painterly abilities and his wonderfully immediate tactile and visual awareness produce. Burns's comment that "richness is kin to rankness"31 is worth noting because, as he remarks, it provides a logical explanation for White's corresponding emphasis on "dreck," especially upon the waste products of the human body. Hurtle Duffield, the painter in The Vivisector, spends an inordinate amount of time seated in his outdoor lavatory musing upon the products of his peristaltic labors. Burns observes in a different connection that the lavatory has possibly a more honored place in Australia than in any other country, at least in the literature by novelists, because of the Australian use of low comic devices to demolish what is high. This is certainly not White's purpose in sending Hurtle so often to the lavatory. The parallels between the workings of Hurtle's imagination and the movements of the lower bowel have a more artistic explanation, but even so, like so much else in White's novels, it may strike the average reader as very strange. White himself feels that his novels are quite old-fashioned and traditional and does not think of himself as an innovator. He has placed himself in the tradition of the nineteenth-century Russians, Stendhal, Flaubert (but not the romantic Flaubert of Salammbo), and Balzac; sometimes in that of Dickens.32 The realism of these novelists is clearly defined: it is usually made quite explicit where realism ends and fantasy begins. In White's novels, however, the distinction between illusion and reality is not always clear. One can hardly imagine Balzac or Dickens conceiving such a relationship as that between the principal characters of Voss. Laura is at home while Voss is going through hell exploring the Australian desert. Their love affair owes everything to ESP, for their relationship is telepathic. Laura knows when things are going badly for Voss, and her own physical condition is affected in sympathy. We know that it is not the physical reality that counts, for Voss and Laura were never lovers in the physical sense. This is a spiritual relationship, but it is 31Bums, The Direction of Australian Fiction, p. 199. 32"A Conversation with Patrick White," pp. 135-42. WHITE j 467</page><page sequence="10">unbelievable. As A. A. Phillips says, "the ghostly love affair won't get off the page, won't acquire the flavour of an experience."33 John Rorke's defense of this relationship as "two separate histories, two separate unfolding expressions of aspects and impulses of the spiritual life each is enduring-not together, but alone," raises many un- answered questions.34 If, as Rorke maintains, the relationship is not essentially mystical, in what sense is there any relationship at all when so much separateness is involved? With any other writer the weakness of this relationship would have seriously affected the artistic nature of the novel, but White's descriptive gift and soaring imagination transform what might have been a disaster into an artistic achieve- ment of high quality. White's aesthetic credo appears in an essay he wrote entitled "The Prodigal Son": "Always something of a frustrated painter and a composer manqud, I wanted to give my book [Voss] the texture of music and the sensuousness of paint, to convey through the theme and the characters of Voss what Delacroix and Blake might have seen, what Mahler and Lizst might have heard."35 The intention to write with "the texture of music and the sensuousness of paint" is fulfilled in White's major works, relieving his art of any burden that he himself has given it to bear. Perhaps the best example of the triumph of White's descriptive art over any thematic and structural defects is in his novel Riders in the Chariot. He could not have chosen a more ineffective, outdated philosophy for creating the principal character, the German Jew, Himmelfarb. The mortal career of Himmelfarb, one of the four "burnt ones" of the story, represents the progress of a soul seen in the looking glass of Cabbalistic theosophy. The theosophic tenet providing the motive theme, the delineation of the anthropomorphic notion of the soul, has turned up before, in the mind of Laura in Voss. The three stages in this Cabbalistic theosophy are described as: God entering into man; Man; Man returning to God. For Riders in the Chariot, White took great pains to familiarize himself with the principal features of Jewish mysticism as seen in the Biblical books of Genesis and Ezekiel, in the Book of Enoch, in the earlier Hekhaloth tracts, and especially in the massive literature of the thirteenth-century Zohar, the Bible of Jewish mysticism. 33A. A. Phillips, in Keesing, Australian Postwar Novelists, p. 185. 34John Rorke, "Patrick White and the Critics," Southerly, No. 2 (1959), p. 72. 35Australian Letters, 1, No. 3 (1962), 39. 468 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="11">In a lecture delivered at the University of New South Wales in 1962 and subsequently published in Southerly, Colin Roderick stated his opinion about the philosophy of Riders in the Chariot: As a philosophy, as a motivating force in the life of man, it is, as far as those who are nourished on received philosophy are concerned, as dead as a dodo. It has long ceased to be much more than a matter of intellectual curiosity in Jewry-if it ever was anything more. It has validity only for those who move in latter-day theosophist circles dominated by the doctrine derived by Madame Blavatsky from Zoharic literature .... It must be said that the philosophical basis of the novel is so far removed from the stream of Western thought that the work emerges as an exercise in medieval Jewish mysticism-its purity marred, to all appearances, by the alien imposition of the central drama of Christian dogma.36 Then Roderick asks the inevitable question: "The static philosophy of Riders in the Chariot places a heavy burden on its art, and the question arises, why is it that the novel does take hold of the reader?" Roderick finds an explanation partly in White's management of the novel's complexities of structure, but not all of the critics agree with him on this. He mentions "the constantly shifting kaleidoscope of the book's revelation of the driving force behind his four ecstatics," but the shift from one to the other of his four "burnt ones" is regarded by some as a fundamental weakness.37 Most of all, Roderick mentions White's style, for this is likely to provide the real reason for White's prestige, as well as the answer to the question posed by Roderick. He describes White's style as a style that harmonises with the structure of the book and the nature of the characters-a style which I have called contrapuntal, and which is not without its affiliations in seventeenth-century English prose, particularly that of Sir Thomas Browne, a style embellished with quaint ornaments of the author's predilection [the painter with his brush? - L.H.], curious, minutely detailed in thought and direction, at times driving into the profounder depths or soaring into great heights.... The work speaks eloquently to us because its author's style preserves the identity of the original [Zoharic] idea. It is unnecessary to multiply instances of the rightness of his style for the form and idea of his book. His purity of motive persists throughout the book and confers on it a peculiar and distinctive 36Colin Roderick, "Riders in the Chariot: An Exposition," Southerly, No. 2 (1962), pp. 70-76. 37For example, see Vincent Buckley, "The Novels of Patrick White," in Dutton, The Literature of Australia, p. 424. WHITE 1 469</page><page sequence="12">contrapuntal flavour, consisting as it does of reinforcing harmonies [White the composer? - L.H.] that surge upward like remembered anthem chords. These harmonies arise from repetitions of mental experience, reinforce- ment of sense impressions, and confirmation of reflective processes. (pp. 74, 76) The embellishments of style referred to by Roderick are related to the material of the narrative. White's style cannot be considered apart from the main fabric of his novels, and the most general effect of his style is to produce what McAuley has called an "hallucinated response" from the reader.38 It is not surprising that resistance to such a response has been fairly widespread from readers of a more practical turn of mind, especially if they feel out of sympathy with White's characters. White's vision of the basic problem, the ultimate separateness of soul, is located in a world of allegory, of which the dominating motif is pain. The need to accept failure and defeat belongs to White's general theme, and his purpose is to show the defeats of his characters as victories. According to Patricia Morley, "all that is required is a change in point of view"39 in order to see personal defeat as illusion hiding the reality of personal victory. Opinions differ greatly as to whether White succeeds entirely in helping his readers to accept this point of view with reference to the characters he creates. Some contend that his vision lacks a supreme quality, the quality meant to distinguish what Voss terms "the Christ-picture," and of all White's characters perhaps Voss lacks it most of all-the quality of loving- kindness. J. F. Burrows has maintained, with reference to Riders in the Chariot, that in spite of Roderick's erudite commentary, his argument that " 'this fictional essay in Jewish mysticism' is too esoteric to be relevant to our society, decries a state of affairs that the critic, rather than White, has created. "40 He contends that ignorance of the precise details from Jewish sources does not prevent the reader from an awareness of the emotional issues. The Jewish mysticism expounded by White is by no means the only force in the novel. Burrows criticizes the novel for other reasons, and concludes that for all its felicities, 38James McAuley, "The Gothic Splendours: Patrick White's Voss," in Wilkes, Ten Essays on Patrick White, p. 35. 39The Mystery of Unity, p. 238. 40J. F. Burrows, "Archetypes and Stereotypes: Riders in the Chariot, " in Wilkes, Ten Essays on Patrick White, p. 52. 470 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="13">there are too many questions on which the novel never makes up its mind. The differing opinions of the critics on almost every aspect of White's work are, of course, a measure of his achievement. The kind of vision which White has tried to embody in his novels can claim some very distinguished antecedents, going back at least to Aeschylus, and including Greek tragedy. He has succeeded in placing his work well within the tradition, even if his novels provide for some readers only a subject for debate. The kind of vision White has sought to express demands the subtlest and richest use of language for its realization, and in this, whatever the lapses, his achievement is very considerable. His manner of writing has such an unusual flow of invention and imaginative daring that even when the fabric, for some more conventional reasons, might be judged fractured or seem too transparent, the style transforms it into a rich texture, inviting the reader's close attention. If the painterly quality of White's writing is his most peculiar gift, his style deserves much closer study than it has received until now. No one has attempted a more complete analysis in order to establish the relationship of White's style to his themes and to the novel format. As McClaren has stated, "We have the gabble about White's style and his exploration of the mytho-poetical regions of experience, comment which is largely remarkable for its failure to tell us just how his style operates, or what new regions he has defined through it."41 The main problem for criticism in this regard is how to give White the close reading that the texture of his novels demands and yet pass through the stage of "hallucinated response" to cool analysis and detached judgment. For a better understanding and appreciation of White as a novelist, this is something that needs to be attempted, though his work is not susceptible to easy analysis.
