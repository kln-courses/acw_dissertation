Chapel Hill: North Carolina Univer- sity Press (London: Oxford University Press), 1966. Cloth, 40s. net. THi great merit of this book is its author's evident love for Aeschylus, and his belief in the permanent value of his plays. This belief he justifies, though at perhaps unnecessary length, in the opening chapter. The starting-point of his study is his inability to reconcile the idea of Aeschylus as a great poet with the modern view that he was a backward and naive religious thinker. His problem is understandable, but it is not so easy to accept his thesis that Aeschylus is after all a sophisticated rationalist and humanist, with a 'vision 4598.2 L</page><page sequence="2">5o0 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW of an ever-continuing progress forged by the power of the human intellect'. 'It is Prometheus, then, and not a primitive Zeus nor a warlike Ares, who hovers benignly, optimistically, and triumphantly over Aeschylus' work and provides, as the essential theme of the poet's song, the marvels wrought by the mind of man.' Zeus is not to be thought of in anthropomorphic terms at all, but as an amoral force, 'a symbol of all the world's forces, both creative and destructive'. In attempting to prove this thesis Golden examines the plays under the not very helpful headings of 'Patriotic Drama' (Pers.), 'Political Drama' (Supp., Sept., Oresteia), and 'Religious Drama' (Supp., P. V., and Oresteia). That the patriotic motif is the dominant one in the Persae is a view that has been refuted many times, most recently by Broadhead, and by Kitto in his Sather Lectures. But Golden does not like this play, since he does not find in it the quality of universality that the other works display. The lack of character-portrayal and of conflict in the plot shows, he says, that the play is far removed from the traditional form of tragedy. It is related rather to the genre of epideictic oratory. Since, however, we can only guess what 'traditional' tragedy was like before the Persae, this is a hazardous conclusion. It is at least an equally plau- sible view that it was only as Attic tragedy developed that it presented conflict before the eyes of the audience. The discussion of the Supplices under 'Political Drama' is much too brief to deal with any of the problems of the play. Golden evidently assumes, but without comment, that it is the earliest play. Fuller is the treatment under 'Religious Drama', where the Zeus of the Supplices is contrasted with the harsh, destructive Zeus of the Prometheus as 'the protector of the weak, the avenger of the wronged, and a towering symbol of the ultimate triumph of justice in the world'. This takes scant account of the rest of the trilogy. It is true that argument from lost plays is hazardous, but if anything is reasonably certain about the sequel of the Supplices it is that Zeus does not protect the Danaids, that their prayers are unanswered, that they are forced in spite of everything to marry their cousins. It is the Septem and the Oresteia that provide the principal test of Golden's belief in a rationalist Aeschylus. His main concern is to eliminate the curse or Erinys motif that plays so large a part in the orthodox interpretations of these plays. In the Septem, he argues, it is only Eteocles and the Chorus who talk about the curse: neither is reliable, Eteocles because he is not the 'moral hero' of the play, and because his views are inconsistent with Aeschylus' religious world view as it is seen elsewhere in his work (this argument begs the whole question). Eteocles merely uses conventional religion accordingly as it suits his policy of the moment. The Chorus cannot be trusted because it is an in- effective, frightened, and emotional body of women. More reliable is Ismene, who at 882 ff. and 902 ff. shows that the cause of the tragedy is merely the struggle of the brothers for the possession of Thebes. Aeschylus' purpose is 'to make the strongest possible condemnation of this use of arms to settle a matter of justice'. But the curse will hardly be removed so easily. It is difficult to be- lieve that Eteocles' outburst at 652 ff., the most exciting moment in the play, is nothing more than a cynical use of conventional religion, or that with Ismene's few words Aeschylus expects his audience to understand that the curse may be ruled out as cause of the tragedy. Indeed they echo 727 ff, 788 ff., 941 ff., etc., where the context is clearly that of the curse.</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 151 Similarly in the Oresteia, which sees the establishment of a new world order based on the rule of law, and with man made fully responsible for his actions, Golden holds that the only reason for Agamemnon's murder is Clytaemestra's unnatural lust for power. Her appeals to the daemon are, like Eteocles', mere hypocrisy, an attempt to evade personal responsibility for her actions. In the Choephori Aeschylus describes the effects of the Furies at 269 ff., but shows that he has no naive belief in them by adding (297 ff.) a series of realistic motiva- tions for Orestes' murder of his mother. It is difficult to see why we must choose between one kind of motive and another. Indeed in seeking to reduce everything to rationalistic terms Golden is in danger of presenting us with an Aeschylus who is rather less profound than the one he is trying to replace. Lesky has shown that much of the tragedy of the Septem and Oresteia arises from the very combination of personal responsibility and external force which Golden finds illogical. The curse leads Clytaemestra to murder her husband, but she is none the less guilty; Orestes obeys Apollo's command, but he makes it part of his own will. It is here that the profundity lies, and not in a simple belief in the triumphs of human progress. Perhaps we should find that the problem of the primitive Aeschylus who happened to write great poetry is not a real one at all, if we could resist the temptation to equate 'primitive' with 'shallow' or 'childish'. The truths that Aeschylus expresses are expressed not in terms of abstract logic or modern symbolism, but in terms of myth. They are none the less profound for that. University of Glasgow A. F.
