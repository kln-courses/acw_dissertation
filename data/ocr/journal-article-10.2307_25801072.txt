The Neolithic and Early Bronze Age prehistory of the region is known to western scholars only through a few English translations of the works of A. R Okladnikov. Since the publication of Okladnikov's model, the region has witnessed large-scale archaeological fieldwork that has produced abundant quantities of new evidence. Moreover, the model has been partly invalidated by extensive radiocarbon dating. Research advances over the last couple of decades have augmented the area's previous reputation but have also revealed the need for new theoretical perspectives and modern analytical techniques. KEY WORDS: Lake Baikal; foragers; Neolithic; Bronze Age; Siberia. INTRODUCTION The Lake Baikal region has a very rich archaeological record and forms an excellent laboratory for the study of early Holocene foraging ad aptations. Human presence over the last 20,000 years has resulted in nu merous stratified habitation sites and scores of burial sites. Excavations often produce large quantities of both artifactual and osteological material, creating opportunities for studying various aspects of foraging adaptations. The material is also relevant from a global perspective because there is a 1 Department of Anthropology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 2H4 Canada. 99 0892-7537/95/0300-0099S07.50A) ? 1995 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">100 Weber Angara Ust'-Ilimsk 2. 933 *32 4,39. 35 15,17 *7 Ust'-Kut ies 73, *82 o34 69 9.40 Bratsk 3 - 27. e36 80 25 7977,81 7 76 78s4 0' 67 52 70 * .14,37 Kachug *75 8,21 47,48 .68 42,50 326 6 18,19,20 62,65 Belaia 23 29,30,38 56466 5,6,13 8 4 60 11 Irkutsk O ~ - 45 c Kito1 12,74 e 54,56,57 e5 p 5355 - e58 16 - Irkut 0 250</page><page sequence="3">Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of the Lake Baikal Region 101 general paucity of well-stratified dwelling sites and well-preserved burials of parallel antiquity in other geographically similar areas of the world. Among non-Russian readers, the perception of Lake Baikal prehistory is based mainly upon a few English translations of the works of Aleksei Pavlovich Okladnikov (1959, 1964; Okladnikov and Konopatskii, 1974 1975) and the research interests of a handful of Western scholars including H. N. Michael (1958, 1992a, b), P. Tolstoy (1958), J. B. Griffin (1960), and C. S. Chard (1958, 1974). Most of these publications date from the 1950s or 1960s and do not reflect the current state of research. In this article, I provide a summary of archaeological work on Neolithic and Early Bronze Age hunters and gatherers of the Lake Baikal region since the 1950s, that is, since Okladnikov (1950, 1955) published his monumental synthesis of the region's early Holocene prehistory. I review major field projects and discuss progress in the area of analytical studies on culture history. Two factors limit the scope of this summary. First, the results of only a few excavations have been extensively published. Many projects are known only from brief or unpublished field reports, while others have been referred to only by third parties. Second, almost all analytical work has been done as dissertation research, accessible almost exclusively through dissertation summaries. Such summaries typically present the most general findings and do not provide much methodological and analytical detail. Consequently, this paper highlights culture historical studies with an em phasis on material culture, the traditional focal area of Russian archaeol ogy. Research relating to other aspects of Lake Baikal prehistory is not discussed because of lack of space (biological anthropology) or relative pau Fig. 1.

I have dealt with social issues elsewhere (We ber, 1994, 1995). In this article, I hope to demonstrate that work during the last two or three decades has identified new and exciting research topics and has con firmed that the Lake Baikal region is, indeed, one of the best areas in the entire Subarctic for the study of prehistoric foraging adaptations. GEOGRAPHIC CONTEXT The definition of the Lake Baikal region in this paper follows that of Michael (1958, p. 5). The area, located in the southern part of Central Siberia, encompasses the Angara basin down to Ust'-Ilimsk, the drainage of the Upper Lena down to Kirensk, and the islands and coasts of the lake itself (Fig. 1). Because of the arbitrary nature of this definition, I also refer to a few sites outside the Lake Baikal region. Their inclusion is warranted by marked similarities in archaeological material. This region, stretching between 52 and 58?N latitude, features a con tinental climate marked by long, cold, snowy winters and short, very warm, dry summers (Atlas SSSR, 1984). The average July and January tempera tures are about 20 and -26?C, respectively. The growing period (defined by a daily average temperature of 5?C or more) begins in mid-May and ends in late September. The immediate vicinity of the lake and the valley of the Upper Angara are free of permafrost; however, long and cold winters mean that the ground freezes to a depth of between 120 and 220 cm. Most of the total precipitation of 400 mm falls during the growing period. Snow cover varies between 30 and 80 cm, and the number of days with snow cover is about 180. The main river of the Lake Baikal basin, the Angara, has a 5-month ice-free period starting in May (Atlas SSSR, 1984). Today, the region is located within a southern taiga and transitional steppe-forest zone. The vegetation is dominated by conifers and birch. The typical taiga landscape in the north grades into a more open steppe-forest countryside in the south. The OPkhon region on Lake Baikal features a semiarid microclimate resembling that of the Mediterranean. This transi tional belt has been very sensitive to Late Pleistocene and Holocene cli matic fluctuations, during which plant and animal communities shifted north or south (Khotinskiy, 1984a, b). The dominant species of terrestrial animals include roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.), red deer (Cervus elaphus L.), elk (Alces alces L.), and musk deer (Moschus moschiferus L.). The Lake Baikal seal is the most famous aquatic resource, but various fish, for ex ample, sturgeon (Acipenser baeri), burbot (Lota lota), grayling (Thymallus</page><page sequence="5">Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of the Lake Baikal Region 103 arcticus), pike (Esox lucius), omul' (Coregouns autumnalis), and whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus), also abound (Kozhov, 1972; Shvetsov et ai, 1984). OKLADNIKOVS MODEL OF CULTURE HISTORY In Siberian archaeology, the term "Neolithic" is not associated with agriculture and sedentism, as is typically the case in Western archaeology. The advent of the Neolithic in this region is marked by the appearance of pottery, the bow and arrow, and stone polishing techniques (Khlobystin, 1978). The Early Bronze Age is associated with the introduction of copper objects such as rings, needles, tubes, and knives. Archaeological research at Lake Baikal dates back to the nineteenth century. The major events of this early period include the excavation of the burial site at Kitoi by Vitkovskii (1880, 1881, 1882, 1889), Petri's field work at Ulan-Khada on Lake Baikal in 1912 and 1913, and Petri's (1926, 1928) attempt at a synthesis of the region's Neolithic prehistory. More de tailed information on the beginnings of archaeological research is shown by Okladnikov (1950, pp. 13-50) and Savel'ev (1989). In the 1950s, Okladnikov (1950, 1955) presented a new model for the development of prehistoric cultures in the Lake Baikal region based on material accumulated from the second half of the nineteenth century to the beginning of World War II. The majority of this material resulted from his own extensive fieldwork during the 1930s. The evidence consisted pri marily of burial data from about 300 Neolithic and Early Bronze Age graves (Okladnikov, 1950, pp. 94-96, 1955, pp. 11-15, Table 5). Of the several dozen sites discovered, very few were excavated in a systematic manner, and of the few occupation sites known, only the stratified deposits of Ulan Khada on Lake Baikal produced evidence of much significance (Oklad nikov, 1950, pp. 98-116). On the basis of typological classification of this material, Okladnikov suggested unilinear progression through four developmental stages (Fig. 2): Isakovo, Serovo, Kitoi, and Glazkovo. Each of these cultures was charac terized by specific forms of artifacts, mortuary practices, social structure, technology, and subsistence. A summary of this model is presented here as a point of departure for the discussion of subsequent research. The rela tively large space allocated to Okladnikov's model is justified by the domi nant role it has played. Moreover, its comprehensiveness has never been matched by subsequent researchers. The outline is based on the original publications (Okladnikov, 1950, 1955) because Okladnikov never intro duced any substantial modifications to his synthesis in later works (Oklad nikov, 1970, 1974, 1978).</page><page sequence="6">104 Weber The Isakovo Culture As Okladnikov (1950, p. 93) classified only 12 graves as Isakovo, the description of this culture was rather brief (Okladnikov, 1950, pp. 165-190). The Isakovo people, who introduced the bow and arrow, pottery, and stone polishing, ushered in the Neolithic stage of cultural evolution (Okladnikov, 1950, p. 190). In general terms, Isakovo and its burial ritual are best described as simple and uniform. Isakovo grave pits are typically filled with limestone slabs, with the body placed in an extended position on the bottom (Fig. 3). Associated artifacts consist of an array of hunting equipment, including bone spear points, flint knives, numerous stone arrowheads, and a clay ves sel. No bows have been preserved, suggesting that they were noncomposite and made solely of wood. The crude pottery of this stage, the so-called Net-Impressed I style (Fig. 2), is miter-shaped, round-bottomed, and usu ally covered with net impressions (Fig. 4a). Ornamental items include boar tusk pendants and antler beads. Isakovo graves do not contain any fishing gear, thus implying that these people subsisted primarily on hunting large CO o CO CD O CL ;;;;;;; (DO Early Middle Late Early Bronze N e o ;l i t h i c Years BC 4000 3000 2000 1000 Fig. 2.

The Isakovo culture appeared to Okladnikov to be extremely archaic, showing direct linkages with the Meso lithic (Okladnikov, 1950, pp. 184-190).</page><page sequence="8">106 Weber The Serovo Culture Graves of the Serovo culture were more numerous (18 localities with 37 burials on the Angara) and, also occurring on the Upper Lena, geo graphically more widely distributed. Serovo graves are typically lined and filled with stones. The majority contains only one individual, usually in an extended position, although communal graves are also known (Fig. 5). The most striking feature of the burial ritual is its uniformity within sites as well as between sites often separated by a great distance. This uniformity is seen in body position, orientation, and grave goods. The standardization of grave objects is such that it does not differentiate between sexes, and there were no exceptionally rich or poor interments. The Serovo grave in ventory is dominated by hunting gear and typically includes such items as a bow, arrows, a clay vessel, a polished slate or green nephrite adze, a spear, and various knives. The miter-shaped ware of Isakovo times is now replaced by oval, round-bottomed pots with often partially obliterated net impressions (Fig. 2, Net II) (Okladnikov, 1950, pp. 207, 212) and with lugs for suspension and use as smudge pots (Fig. 4b). The new style also often includes various comb impressions, primarily around the rim and sometimes on a horizontal applique (Okladnikov, 1950, pp. 110, 209). All this evidence, according to Okladnikov, represented an egalitarian foraging culture in which the major subsistence activity was hunting large game. The Serovo people were responsible for a number of technological and economic innovations, of which the composite bow of wood and bone is a good example. Their use of riverine resources for food is documented by harpoons, fishhooks, net sinkers, polished stone figurines carved in im ages of different fish species, and fish bones. All these advances led to a substantial population increase. The uniformity of the burial ritual suggests an egalitarian society with minimal sexual differentiation in labor or social status (Okladnikov, 1950, pp. 269, 271). The Kitoi Culture The Kitoi culture continues the trend toward greater reliance on fish ing, increased diversification of social relations, and technological progress (Okladnikov, 1950, pp. 355-376, 378-383, 403-411). The database for de scribing the Kitoi culture was provided by 42 graves from eight localities, including the famous sites of Kitoi and Lokomotiv (the latter also known in the literature as the Glazkovo or Tsiklodrom cemetery). Features used to identify Kitoi graves were the consistent use of red ocher to cover the deceased and the less consistent?but frequent and abundant?presence of</page><page sequence="9">Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of the Lake Baikal Region 107 0 cm_10 d Fig. 4.

Body position is usually extended and skeletons often lack skulls (Fig. 6). Orientation of burials also shows greater variation. At the Kitoi site, some of the burials were oriented toward the NE; the rest, toward the SW. Graves normally contain one individual, but communal graves are more frequent and more diverse in their content than before.</page><page sequence="10">108 Weber Fig. 5. Burial of Serovo culture (after Ok ladnikov, 1950, Fig. 83). Kitoi burials also exhibit a change in the kind and quantity of grave goods. Grave assemblages vary considerably, but the prevalence of fishing equipment with composite fishhooks and harpoons is conspicuous. The pro portion of fishhooks to arrowheads is reversed, compared to the earlier</page><page sequence="11">Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of the Lake Baikal Region 109 Serovo culture. There are individual graves with rich furnishings, but very poor burials are also present. Male grave goods appear to be richer and show greater diversity than female goods. Clay vessels are rare in Kitoi graves, and only one miter-shaped pot with net impressions was known to Okladnikov (1950, p. 111). Pottery style was thus inferred on the basis of material from living sites, primarily Ulan Khada, where Layers III-VIII, overlying the Serovo Layers X and IX, were identified by Okladnikov as Kitoi (1950, pp. Ill, 386-387). Characteristic of this stage are vessels of oval shape with slightly reverted rims and deco rated with various combinations of multiple horizontal lines or chevrons on the upper third of the body. Such ornamentation was typically made using the stab-and-drag technique. Multiple burials and variable grave furnishing were interpreted by Ok ladnikov as evidence for the transition from a matriarchal to a patriarchal society. A shift toward increased use of fish for food and the development of patriarchal social relations was accompanied by new technologies, in cluding more frequent use of tools made of very tough green nephrite (a rare commodity in the Serovo culture), the development of exceptional bone tool technology, the invention of shaft straighteners, the use of very fine retouch on flaked stone artifacts, improved pottery, and advances in fishing gear. The Glazkovo Culture The Glazkovo culture represents the continuation of major changes that were initiated during the Serovo culture and greatly advanced during Kitoi. Fishing gains further importance, technology advances, population continues to grow, and the social position of women deteriorates (Oklad nikov, 1955, pp. 6-7, 12-59, 61-117, 203-265, 307-322). The characteristics of Glazkovo were inferred by Okladnikov (1950, p. 96) on the basis of 75 graves from the Angara Valley. They were sup plemented later by evidence from the large cemetery at Verkholensk (Ok ladnikov, 1978). A total of about 200 graves was known, including burials from the Trans-Baikal and Upper Lena (Okladnikov, 1955, p. 65). Glazkovo graves differ from earlier interments in that they are covered by an elon gated paving of slabs or boulders. Grave pits, like those of Isakovo and Serovo, are stone filled. The body is usually placed on the bottom of the pit in an extended position, with arms close to the trunk and one hand sometimes resting on the abdomen (Fig. 7). Slightly flexed burials occur more frequently than before. A new and typically Glazkovo feature, al though rare, is burial in a squatting position (Okladnikov, 1955, pp. 307</page><page sequence="12">110 Weber Fig. 6. Burial of Kitoi culture (after Oklad nikov, 1974, Plate 9-1). 308). Cremation or partial cremation was also occasionally practiced. Most of the graves are single, but communal graves also exist (Okladnikov, 1955, pp. 204, 234). Orientation of Glazkovo graves is also distinctive. At Ver kholensk, for example, the Glazkovo graves were all parallel to the river and arranged in rows perpendicular to it. The Serovo burials, on the other hand, were all perpendicular to the river and not organized in neat rows (Okladnikov, 1955, pp. 235-236). With regard to grave goods and material culture, the most important innovation is the appearance of copper objects (e.g., fishhooks, needles, knives, and rings). Otherwise the material culture seems to be entirely typi</page><page sequence="13">Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of the Lake Baikal Region 111 cal of the Stone Age. Male graves usually contain fishing gear (harpoons and fishhooks) and, to a certain extent, hunting tools (knives and arrow heads). Female graves usually display only domestic gear (scrapers, needles, needle cases, and adzes) and ornaments?a pattern suggestive of sexual division of labor. Pottery of the Glazkovo stage, occurring very rarely in graves, contin ues morphological and ornamental trends from earlier times. Vessels of mitered and oval shapes are both known, and stab-and-drag is the most frequent ornamentation (Fig. 4d) (Okladnikov, 1950, pp. 126-129, 276 278). More common new features include a tendency toward complete cov erage of the vessel's surface with various types of horizontal motifs (Fig. 4c) and the appearance of small spherical protrusions on the outside sur face executed from within?the so-called "Pearl" ornament (Fig. 4d). Evidence from graves indicates the prominent role of fishing. Personal hunting equipment, such as daggers and spears, is rare. An exception is a simple wooden bow, the use of which is well documented by frequent finds of stone arrowheads in graves. The development of new harpoon types, two- and three-pronged leisters, copper fishhooks, amulets of fish bones, and smaller-sized arrowheads seems to indicate that fishing was a primary source of food and that the importance of hunting continued to decline (Okladnikov, 1955, pp. 111-112). This increased reliance on fishing, alleg edly one of the most labor-intensive modes of subsistence, led to a con solidation of truly patriarchal social relations. Since it was men who established their control over subsistence, their social position became even more prominent. Chronology of the Model In sum, Okladnikov argued for continuous cultural evolution of local foragers from the Early Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age (Fig. 2) (Ok ladnikov, 1950, p. 139, Table 8). My objective here is not to discuss the foundations of Okladnikov's dating (for a better summary see Michael, 1958), but a brief explanation will be helpful. The entire process of devising a chronological scheme was based on relative dating techniques, of which typological analysis of material culture and mortuary ritual played the most important role. Stratigraphy was less useful because of the paucity of data (Okladnikov, 1950, pp. 117-140). The Glazkovo complex was placed at the end of the sequence due to the presence of metal objects. Of the remaining three units, Kitoi showed more similarities with Glazkovo (nephrite arti facts, abundant fishing gear, and communal burials) and &lt;thus was believed to be its direct predecessor. Isakovo assemblages displayed simple pottery</page><page sequence="14">112 Weber Fig. 7. Burial of Glazkovo culture (after Okladnikov, 1955, Fig. 72-1).</page><page sequence="15">Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of the Lake Baikal Region 113 and stoneworking, which justified their placement at the beginning of the sequence. The intermediate position of the Serovo culture was confirmed by similarities with both Isakovo (hunting gear) and Kitoi (e.g., nephrite knives and asymmetric arrowheads). The absolute chronology of the younger stages was determined on the basis of artifactual similarities with neighboring regions. Occurrences of copper and bronze knives, shell beads, and nephrite bracelets in Glazkovo, and of marble rings, bone pins, and ocher in Kitoi, were correlated with other geographic regions, such as the Minusinsk Basin in the Upper Yenisei area, China, the Near East, Scandinavia, and central Europe. Connections were also drawn with the Oleneostrovskii cemetery in northern Russia. The chronology of the Isakovo and Serovo cultures was derived on the basis of their inferred position between the end of the Mesolithic and the succeed ing cultures. An Early Critique Soon after the publication of the model, Gerasimov (1955, pp. 442 450) launched one of the most effective critiques of Okladnikov's ideas. First, he believed that the archaeological material identified by Okladnikov as Isakovo and Serovo showed no significant differences and suggested that the two should be considered one archaeological complex?the Serovo. Second, he claimed that the material culture and burial ritual of Serovo and Glazkovo showed numerous similarities and continuity (e.g., composite and one-piece fishhooks, harpoons without a hole at the base, similar adze and arrowhead forms, use of stone in grave filling, and lack or rare use of ocher) and, thus, should be considered as two consecutive stages of an evo lutionary continuum. The Kitoi culture, on the other hand, displayed fewer affiliations with either culture. Third, Gerasimov criticized both Oklad nikov's focus on burial data and his selective treatment of the available archaeological material. Fourth, his examination of Neolithic human skele tal material led him to conclude that Kitoi skulls homogeneously displayed a number of "proto-mongoloid" characteristics. In contrast, skulls from the Isakovo/Serovo and Glazkovo complexes were more heterogeneous. Fifth, archaeological evidence (stratigraphy, grave form, grave goods, ocher, and body position and orientation) from the Fofanovo cemetery, where both Kitoi and Glazkovo graves were found, suggested a lack of cultural conti nuity between the two cultures and a substantial chronological gap between the two uses of this burial site (Gerasimov and Chernykh, 1975, pp. 23, 47). Thus, Gerasimov (1955, pp. 414-450) suggested that the Kitoi culture</page><page sequence="16">114 Weber should be placed at the beginning of the sequence, while Isakovo should be incorporated into the Serovo complex. This early critique of the Okladnikov model is important because it established the focus of archaeological debate during the next few decades. This discussion revolved mainly around the chronological position, origin, and role of the Kitoi culture in the Lake Baikal Neolithic. FIELDWORK SINCE OKLADNIKOVS SYNTHESIS The publication of Okladnikov's synthesis coincided with the beginning of a new era in archaeological fieldwork in the region. With the construc tion of three hydroelectric power plants on the Angara River (Irkutsk, Bratsk, and Ilimsk), fieldwork was carried out on a scale previously un known (Vasirevski, 1978a). The entire coast of Lake Baikal and the banks of the Angara from Baikal to Ilimsk, as well as the shores of other smaller rivers (Ilim, Belaia), were subjected to archaeological reconnaissance. The most promising sites were excavated. Often, areas of hundreds or even thousands of square meters were excavated at sites identified as crucial for the prehistory of the area and in immediate danger. At sites of lesser im portance, excavations were in the range of 100 m2, and all endangered lo calities were at least tested. In the Upper Lena basin, fieldwork has been less extensive than on Lake Baikal or the Angara, mainly because of the lack of large river-related industrial construction. For clarity and ease of use, available information on fieldwork in the Lake Baikal region is summarized in tabular form (Table I). Figure 1 plots all sites whose geographic coordinates could be established. CULTURE HISTORY DEBATE The scale and tempo of archaeological fieldwork in the Lake Baikal region during the last few decades has been impressive. Its contribution to our knowledge and understanding of the region's prehistory, however, is difficult to evaluate. Vasirevskii (1978a, p. 5) has observed that, with the sole exception of the Fofanovo cemetery (Gerasimov and Chernykh, 1975), all archaeological material excavated during the 1950s remains unpublished. He believes that the rate of accumulation of new evidence has far exceeded the ability of the Lake Baikal archaeological community to process it. Savel'ev (1989, p. 1), admitting that the theoretical premises of Oklad nikov's synthesis have not been compatible with those of modern archae</page><page sequence="17">Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of the Lake Baikal Region 115 ology, states that the enormous volume of material has actually hindered theoretical reflection and led to minimal progress. Some results have been announced in the form of brief field reports (see Table I for references). Nevertheless, analytical and integrative efforts have not been alto gether neglected. Many of the sites discussed here have provided data for theses and dissertations (e.g., Khlobystin, 1964b; Svinin, 1970; Geor gievskaia, 1979; Konopatskii, 1979; Zubkov, 1982; Goriunova, 1984b; Sini tsyna, 1986; SavePev, 1989). However, such studies, most unpublished, have had very limited impact. Even the Russian archaeological community has very limited access to this research, for dissertation summaries are normally circulated in very small numbers, provide very general information, and lack illustrative material. Use of different terminological conventions and delays in publishing also make it difficult to assess research. In short, many crucial sites, both living and burial, are yet to be comprehensively analyzed and published (e.g., Gorelyi Les, Lokomotiv, Posol'sk, Ust-Belaia, and Ulan-Khada). Despite this patchy record, the following sections attempt to review the major areas of study, with a focus on alternative models of cul ture history. Since the publication of Okladnikov's synthesis (1950, 1955), most dis cussion has revolved around two issues: the age and nature of the Kitoi culture and the correlation of burial and settlement complexes. Scholarly opinions of the Kitoi problem can generally be grouped into three classes. One more or less follows Okladnikov's model (e.g., Svinin, 1974; Va sil'evskii, 1978b), another also advocates a unilinear sequence of archae ological cultures but with Kitoi as its beginning (e.g., Gerasimov, 1955; Konopatskii, 1979, 1982), while the third suggests coexistence of Kitoi and Serovo as the result either of local cultural development (e.g., Savel'ev and Medvedev, 1973; Khlobystin, 1978; Georgievskaia, 1979, 1989; Goriunova 1984b; Sinitsyna, 1986; Goriunova and Khlobystin, 1991) or of migration from the outside (e.g., Khlobystin, 1964a, 1969; Zubkov, 1982). The second major focus, correlation of burial complexes with camp sites, has not been an easy task, for burial and settlement materials are often not compatible. Some have avoided the issue (Konopatskii, 1982), others have provided incomplete proposals (Zubkov, 1982; Sinitsyna, 1986; Georgievskaia, 1989; Savel'ev, 1989), while still others have presented con flicting interpretations (Khlobystin, 1978; Zubkov, 1982). This is, in part, explained by the nature of settlement materials. Most of the Neolithic strata were mixed and yielded various combinations of Isakovo, Serovo, Kitoi, and Glazkovo features (e.g., Khlobystin, 1969, 1978; Zubkov, 1982; Goriunova, 1984b). Very seldom have individual layers been assigned to specific ar chaeological cultures. Efforts to correlate burial complexes with living sites have concentrated on pottery styles, since lithics have been thought not</page><page sequence="18">0% Table I.

Both of these major issues are stressed in the following presentation of the more recent culture history models. Geographical specifics are usu ally left out, for most of the schemes are relevant for the entire Lake Baikal region. Chronology of the models has been inferred from stratigraphic evi dence, typology, and available radiocarbon dates. All ages in the text and Figs. 8-11 are given as uncalibrated radiocarbon years. Khlobystin's Model I begin with Khlobystin's model because it proposed significant modi fications regarding the dating of the Serovo and Kitoi cultures. Further more, it introduced the important view that Posol'sk pottery is a settlement correlate of Kitoi. Basic characteristics of the Khlobystin model (1964a, b, 1965, 1969, 1978) are given in Fig. 8. Its relationships with Okladnikov's scheme are quite clear. Similarities include its general adherence to the definitions of the burial complexes, its dating of the Early and Middle Neo lithic, and its correlation of Net-Impressed and Comb pottery with Isakovo and Serovo, respectively. Differences between the two models refer mainly to the Kitoi culture and developments during the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age. According to Khlobystin, Serovo and Kitoi were contempo raneous. The former is correlated with Net and Comb pottery, while the latter corresponds to settlement deposits containing Posol'sk pottery. The following new style was identified by Khlobystin (1964a, p. 29, 1969, p. 91) on the basis of materials from Ulan-Khada (Layer IX) and Posol'sk, both on Lake Baikal: Vessels with straight walls; they have applique, triangular or rectangular in cross section, placed about 1-1.5 cm from the rim. Above the applique is usually a series of small holes. The pots are thick walled (5-7 mm) and crude in appearance. The surface shows evidence of stamping with either a cord-wrapped or decorated paddle. Decorations consist of dentate impressions and lines made with the "stab-and-drag" technique. Two lines of evidence were used to support the contemporaneity of these cultures: stratigraphic and spatial. At Ulan-Khada, fragments of Se rovo and Kitoi pottery were found together (Khlobystin, 1969), but Serovo and Kitoi graves were separated by the Angara. Thus, Khlobystin argued that toward the end of the Isakovo period, two distinct cultures formed on the left and right sides of the Angara River: Kitoi and Serovo, respectively. Furthermore, because Glazkovo graves were known from a larger area than the preceding cultures, he suggested that at the end of the Middle Neolithic</page><page sequence="25">Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of the Lake Baikal Region 123 4000 3000 2000 Years BC 1000 Fig. 8. Khlobystin's model of culture history for the Neolithic and Early Bronze Ages of the Lake Baikal region (after Khlobystin, 1978). All ages are given as uncalibrated years BC. these two cultures unified and formed the Glazkovo complex. These changes are also well reflected in pottery (Fig. 8), which shows homogeneity during Isakovo and Glazkovo times (Net-Impressed and Ust-Belaia styles, respectively) and greater diversity during the Kitoi/Serovo stage. He also believed that the origin of the Glazkovo culture was deeply rooted in Late Neolithic times. Sinitsyna and SavePev's Model The models offered by Sinitsyna (1986) and Savel'ev (1989) show enough similarities to justify their combined discussion (Fig. 9). This model will be reviewed in more detail because it provides definitions of various pottery styles used repeatedly by other scholars.

This style is dated from the end of the fifth to the beginning of the third millennium BC and is defined by characteristic net impressions on the exterior surface of clay vessels. The usual strati graphic position of this pottery is at the bottom of Neolithic deposits, some times immediately following the Mesolithic (aceramic) strata; it is considered to be the oldest pottery of the region. It is known not only from the Cis-Baikal but essentially from all of Siberia (Glushkov and Glushkova, 1992). In the Lake Baikal region (Fig. 15) it was recorded, for example, at Gorelyi Les (Savel'ev et al., 1974, p. 164), Ityrkhei (Goriunova, 1984b, p. 7), and Ulan-Khada (Khlobystin, 1969, p. 91; Goriunova, 1984b, p. 5). In Early Neolithic layers at Ityrkhei and Ulan-Khada this pottery was the only type documented (Fig. 15). A more detailed examination reveals some variation in ornamentation. Vessels are either covered by net impres</page><page sequence="28">126 Weber 4000 3000 2000 Years BC 1000 Fig. 11.

All ages are given as uncalibrated years BC. sions only, or additional small pits or stamps are applied around the rim. Stratigraphically, the former appears to precede the latter (e.g., Ityrkhei). Morphologically, there are also two types. The miter-shaped vessels have been traditionally associated with the Isakovo culture, while the more closed-mouth (oval or egg-shaped) ware has been attributed to Serovo. Since both forms usually occur together, this style is considered to be a settlement correlate of the combined Isakovo-Serovo culture (Fig. 9). The style continues through the Middle Neolithic.</page><page sequence="29">Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of the Lake Baikal Region 127 Middle Neolithic The Middle Neolithic is defined by greater variation in pottery orna mentation.

Two other but somewhat younger stylistic conventions of the Middle Neolithic are the Ust'-Belaia and Posol'sk styles (Fig. 9). The Khaita Style. The spatial and chronological distributions of this style correspond with those of Net-Impressed pottery. This style, first identified by Savel'ev (1982), is typified by cord impressions near or below the rim and/or various incised lines forming geometric motifs (Sinitsyna, 1986, p. 10; Savel'ev, 1989, p. 22). This type of finish was applied toward the end of the manufacturing process while shaping and smoothing the exterior surface of a vessel using a string- or cord-wrapped paddle (Hurley, 1979). Stratigraphi cally, the Khaita pottery style often occurs in the same context as Net-Im pressed I (Fig. 15). It is reported from Gorelyi Les (Savel'ev et al., 1974, pp. 164-168), Ulan-Khada (Goriunova, 1984b, p. 5; Goriunova and Khlobys tin, 1991, p. 46), and Ityrkhei (Goriunova, 1984b, p. 7) and has also been reported from Kazachka in the Yenisei basin (Generalov, 1979, p. 8). The PosoTsk Style. This style, chronologically straddling the fourth and third millennia BC (Sinitsyna, 1986, p. 10), appears to have a very wide geographic distribution. Posol'sk pottery has been recorded at sites as far west as the Yenisei basin [Niasha (Savel'ev, 1989, p. 23; Goriunova and Khlobystin, 1991, p. 44)], on the west and east coasts of Lake Baikal [Ityr khei, Kulara, Posol'sk, and Tyshkine (Goriunova and Khlobystin, 1991, p. 44)], in the northwestern Trans-Baikal [Okuneva (Goriunova and Khlobys tin, 1991, p. 44)], and on the Upper Lena [Popovskii Lug and Makarovo I (Zubkov, 1982 p. 6)]. On the Angara, Gorelyi Les (Savel'ev, 1989, p. 23) and Nizhne Seredkino (Sinitsyna, 1986, p. 10) also yielded material of this tradition. Overall, the style is characterized by relatively greater variation in ornamentation than Net-Impressed I and Khaita. Sinitsyna, for example, on the basis of variation in vessel shape and ornamentation, identifies four stylistic variants in Posol'sk pottery from Nizhne Seredkino. It also seems that Sinitsyna supports Khlobystin's association of Posol'sk pottery with the Kitoi culture (Sinitsyna, 1986, p. 12). The Ust'-Belaia Style. This style was identified by Savel'ev and Med vedev (1973) on the basis of pottery from Layer IIA at Ust'-Belaia and was initially dated as older than the third millennium BC. It was later sug gested, however, that the Ust'-Belaia style marks the beginning of the Early Bronze Age, as indicated indirectly by radiocarbon dates of 4080 BP ? 60 years for Niasha and 4150 BP ? 80 years for Ulan-Khada (Table II) (Gor iunova, 1984b, p. 11; Savel'ev, 1989, p. 23) and should be regarded as a</page><page sequence="30">128 Weber correlate of the Glazkovo burial complex (cf. Sinitsyna, 1986, p. 12). De spite this late age, the style still shows a strong Neolithic tradition, exem plified by simple oval pots decorated with stab-and-drag and, less frequently, comb impressions. Some decorative motifs are hybrids of the Posol'sk style. Following Sinitsyna (1986, p. 11), three sequential phases can be recognized in the development of this tradition (see also Krizhevskaia, 1978, pp. 87-90). Ust'-Belaia I includes vessels with rims bent slightly inward and decorated with plain or comb stamps arranged in hori zontal bands over the entire surface. Ust'-Belaia II differs in that the rims are very rarely bent inward, and the decoration is less condensed. Also, stamp impressions vary more in form, and the motifs are frequently ar ranged in vertical bands. Radiocarbon dates available for Kazachka (6660 BP ? 190 years, Le-1231; Table II) and Gorelyi Les (5430 BP ? 120 years, Ri-0052 and 4880 BP ? 180 years, GIN-4366; Table II) allowed Sinitsyna to date Ust'-Belaia I approximately to the second half of the fourth and Ust'-Belaia II to the second half of the third millennium BC. Finally, Ust' Belaia III is typified by vessels with straight rims and very sparsely arranged chevrons. This style corresponds closely with early Glazkovo horizons at Ulan-Khada. The Ust'-Belaia style also features wide geographic distribution from the Yenisei basin [Niasha and Kazachka (Generalov, 1979, p. 10)] to Lake Baikal and the Upper Lena [Popovskii Lug (Zubkov, 1982, p. 6)]. According to Sinitsyna (1986, p. 12), the Ust'-Belaia and Posol'sk styles show an inter esting pattern of mutual exclusion: At Nizhne Seredkino and Pad'-Shelot the Middle Neolithic horizons yielded only pottery of the Posol'sk tradition, while Ust'-Belaia lacked this style. It remains unclear, however, what the burial correlates of the Ust'-Belaia I and II styles would be (Fig. 9). The Comb-Impressed Style. Distinctive features of this style include decoration dominated by comb impressions, better firing, carefully smoothed surfaces, reddish color, round bottoms, and wide or narrow mouths. Traditionally, this pottery has been associated with the late Serovo culture (Fig. 9; Sinitsyna, 1986, p. 12). Sinitsyna, on the basis of similarities to pottery from Layer V of Kazachka, dates the Comb-Impressed style to the third millennium BC. According to Savel'ev (1989, p. 23), the style has been widely documented in Central Siberia (e.g., Niasha, Ulan-Khada), and its diverse ornamentation includes motifs similar to those of Posol'sk pot tery (see also Generalov, 1979, pp. 10-11; Okladnikov and Abramova, 1978, p. 112; Tarasov and Sinitsyna, 1978, pp. 124-130). The Podostorozhnoe Style. This style is morphologically identical to Comb-Impressed, but decoration is limited to round or oval depressions on the rim. The dating of this tradition to the mid-third millennium BC is based on morphological analogies with the Comb-Impressed style and on a vessel</page><page sequence="31">Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of the Lake Baikal Region 129 found in a Serovo burial in Podostorozhnoe Grave 4. Thus, it appears to be a version of Comb-Impressed geographically limited to the Angara. Late Neolithic Beginning during the second half of the third millennium BC, this pe riod sees parallel development of four stylistic traditions: Comb-Impressed, Podostorozhnoe, Ust'-Belaia II, and Net-Impressed II. Of these, the first two styles have been correlated with the late Serovo culture. Overall, Late Neolithic pottery is characterized by hybrid versions of the Ust'-Belaia I and Posol'sk styles. The Net-Impressed II Style. This style (also called Nizhne Seredkino) differs from Net-Impressed I in that its impressions are deliberately oblit erated, and at best only imprints of nodes remain visible. The vessel's sur face was subsequently covered with comb impressions or pits arranged in horizontal rows (Okladnikov and Abramova, 1978, p. 112; Sinitsyna, 1986, p. 13). Since no direct radiocarbon dates are available for this pottery, it has been suggested that it dates from the third to the beginning of the second millennium BC, like the morphologically similar Comb-Impressed and Podostorozhnoe styles (Fig. 9) (Sinitsyna, 1986, pp. 12-13, 23). The style is known from the entire Lake Baikal region. Early Bronze Age The beginning of this stage dates to the turn of the third and second millennia BC. Common pottery includes the late Net-Impressed II and Ust'-Belaia III styles, both associated with the early Glazkovo culture. Georgievskaia's Model The primary objective of Georgievskaia's (1989) study was to correlate Kitoi graves with material from living sites in the Upper Angara region. For example, she concludes that the materials from Layer IIA of Ust'-Belaia correlate well with Kitoi graves at the same locality. She also identifies simi lar Kitoi layers in a few other habitation sites on the Angara, such as Nikola, Sosnovyi Island, and Ust'-Ilim. Layers VI and X at Gorelyi Les and Ulan Khada, respectively, have been labeled Kitoi as well (Georgievskaia, 1989, pp. 118, 121). All these layers either are at the base of the stratigraphic column or immediately follow Mesolithic deposits, and they are directly overlain by Glazkovo strata. At Tsar-Devitsa, she observes that the Meso</page><page sequence="32">0r Table II.

She also makes the point that Kitoi and Serovo strata appear to be mutually exclusive: when Kitoi is present, Serovo is absent, and vice versa (Georgievskaia, 1989, p. 135). Also, none of the sites had a stratigraphy that would unequivocally support Okladnikov's unilinear sequence (Georgievskaia, 1989, pp. 5, 88-121). In sum, Geor gievskaia advocates a model of cultural continuity from the Mesolithic through the Early Bronze Age, with Serovo and Kitoi people reflecting con temporaneous tribal divisions. Both groups have roots in the Mesolithic and both contribute eventually to the formation of the Glazkovo culture. Her model, however, raises several questions, of which the most contro versial is the classification of material from Ust'-Belaia. According to Savel'ev and Medvedev (1973, pp. 63-64), this material, and the pottery in particular, cannot be correlated with any of the Neolithic or Early Bronze Age burial complexes of the region, including Kitoi graves at Ust'-Belaia itself. The pot tery from this site was identified as the Ust'-Belaia style and assigned to the Middle/Late Neolithic to Early Bronze Age (Savel'ev and Medvedev, 1973; Sinitsyna, 1986). Concerning Ust'-Ilim, Vasil'evskii (1978b, p. 143) believed that the horizon in question represents Serovo, not Kitoi. Despite these con troversial statements, some of Georgievskaia's findings regarding the strati graphic position of Kitoi and its similarities with the Mesolithic appear to be quite accurate, especially in the light of recent radiocarbon dating. Zubkov's Model This synthesis of Neolithic and Early Bronze Age material from the Upper Lena region (Zubkov, 1982) rests on a rather limited data base. Thus, evidence from Lake Baikal and the Angara Basin is used very fre quently to support findings. Like Gerasimov (1955), Zubkov does not see much justification for the separate treatment of the Isakovo and Serovo cultures. He believes that the appearance of the earliest pottery in the region (Net-Impressed and Khaita) considerably preceded the development of the Isakovo/Serovo burial complex. Furthermore, as no Kitoi graves were recorded in the Upper Lena area, he maintains that the Kitoi people, an intrusive folk in the Lake Baikal Neolithic, did not penetrate this drainage. With regard to correlation between settle ment and burial materials, he strongly argues against Khlobystin's identifica tion of Posol'sk pottery as Kitoi. According to Zubkov, the geographic ranges of the two phenomena are quite incompatible: while Kitoi graves are known</page><page sequence="34">132 Weber essentially only from the Upper Angara, Posol'sk pottery has been recorded from the entire Lake Baikal region and even beyond. In addition to this, Posol'sk pottery has never been found in Kitoi graves (Zubkov, 1982, p. 13). Zubkov, however, does not provide an alternative to the Posol'sk-Kitoi cor relation. Chronologically, the Kitoi culture is still tucked alongside the late Isakovo/Serovo stage, but the evidence for such dating is not convincing. The model seems to indicate a substantial degree of variation in pottery styles from the Middle Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age. Most of these styles are attributed to Isakovo/Serovo and Glazkovo (Fig. 10). In sum, Zubkov's model combines elements of Okladnikov's, Gerasi mov's, and Khlobystin's schemes, with the important difference that the Isakovo/Serovo complex is dated considerably younger. Goriunova's Model Goriunova has been particularly active in the archaeology of the Little Sea area on Lake Baikal, where she has excavated a number of very im portant stratified sites (Table I). Materials from these excavations provided the data base for her dissertation on living sites of the Little Sea region and Ol'khon Island (Goriunova, 1984b). Her earlier views on the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age prehistory of the area have been slightly revised recently (Goriunova and Khlobystin, 1991). A summary of the model is presented in Fig. 11. In general, with few minor modifications in dating and the number of defined pottery styles, the model follows the path out lined earlier by Khlobystin. The beginning of the Neolithic has been pushed farther back to the middle of the fifth millennium BC on the basis of continuity in lithics be tween Mesolithic and Neolithic layers at Ulan-Khada (burins on prismatic blades, pseudo wedge-shaped microcores, retouched prismatic blades, and end scrapers). Proliferation of various pottery styles marks the Middle Neo lithic. The Comb and late Net-Impressed pots correspond with late Isak ovo/Serovo, but the question of burial correlates of the Khaita, and in particular of Posol'sk and Ust'-Belaia styles, is left explicitly open (Gor iunova and Khlobystin, 1991, pp. 46-47). For reasons similar to those of Zubkov, Goriunova disagrees with the correlation of the Posol'sk style with Kitoi (Goriunova and Khlobystin, 1991, p. 46) but advocates the contem poraneity of Kitoi and late Isakovo/Serovo. In support of this claim, she uses stratigraphic evidence from Middle Neolithic strata at Ulan-Khada, Ityrkhei, Berloga, and Tyshkine II and III, which produced materials known from both Serovo and Kitoi graves. Serovo features include pottery (Comb and Net-Impressed), tanged and lozenge-shaped arrowheads, fish lures, bi</page><page sequence="35">Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of the Lake Baikal Region 133 facial knives, and nephrite adzes, while marble rings, an anthropomorphic bone sculpture, adzes with "lugs" (two lateral protrusions near the butt end), and arrow straighteners have been proclaimed as Kitoi (Goriunova, 1984b, p. 14; Goriunova and Khlobystin, 1991, p. 45). Another noteworthy change compared to earlier models is the deci sively older dating of the Glazkovo complex on the basis of radiocarbon dates available for Ulan-Khada (Table II, Nos. 19, 20, 23, 24; Fig. 11). Lithic Evidence These models of Lake Baikal culture history have been based essen tially on variation in pottery and burial material and have not yet been well integrated with other lines of evidence, especially that of lithics. De spite the large size of some collections (Sinitsyna, 1986, p. 15; Medvedev and Savel'ev, 1973, p. 57; Savel'ev et al, 1974; Berdnikova et al., 1991, pp. 27-30), scholars have observed no clear regional or temporal patterns in stone technology. Sinitsyna (1986, p. 21), who examined lithics from Ust' Belaia, Nizhne Seredkino, and Pad'-Shelot, was unable to establish any re lationship between the various categories of lithic artifacts and pottery styles. Overall, she believes that lithic material has proved to be of little value for culture historical studies. Similar opinions are implicit in the work of other scholars whose classifications are based primarily on pottery (e.g., Generalov, 1979, pp. 15-20; Zubkov, 1982, pp. 12-19; Goriunova, 1984b, pp. 13-14). Nevertheless, a general description of the Neolithic stone in dustry is of some value. The Neolithic and Early Bronze Age lithic industry is based on the blade technique, with elements of microblade technology and some Meso lithic or even late Upper Paleolithic features (Savel'ev and Medvedev, 1973, pp. 62-63; Krizhevskaia, 1978, pp. 80, 95; Tarasov and Sinitsyna, 1978, p. 124). Some core types (conical, prismatic, and wedge-shaped), methods of core reduction, and certain tool types (burins, blades for composite tools, perforators, and drills) show clear similarities to those of earlier epochs (Krizhevskaia, 1978, p. 95; see also Medvedev, 1966, 1969a, b; Sinitsyna 1987). There are also some differences. The Neolithic, for example, saw a proliferation of various arrowheads, such as tanged, asymmetrical with con cave base, triangular, lozenge-shaped, and leaf-shaped. The last type, ac cording to Goriunova (1984b, pp. 6, 14), appears to be quite late. Also representative are the development of a microblade technology, increas ingly frequent use of amorphous cores, the disappearance of wedge-shaped (Gobi-type) cores, and a general decline in the quality of core preparation (Krizhevskaia, 1978, p. 80). Lithic collections from the entire Yenisei-An</page><page sequence="36">134 Weber gara-Upper Lena region display marked similarities (Krizhevskaia, 1978, pp. 80, 95; Tarasov and Sinitsyna, 1978, p. 124; Zubkov, 1982, pp. 12-13). According to Krizhevskaia (1978, p. 95), this lack of regional patterning reflects wide spatiotemporal uniformity of the lithic industry rather than postdepositional mixing. This hypothesis, however, needs more direct sup port because most of the sites mentioned above produced only one Neo lithic stratum, which means that deposits of various age could have been compressed into one stratigraphic unit. Analysis of lithic material from sites with better stratigraphic separation, such as Gorelyi Les, Ityrkhei, and Uian-Khada, would provide more reliable conclusions. For this reason, it is useful to present a brief summary of the lithic assemblage from Ulan-Khada, one of the better-stratified and most ex tensively explored sites of the region. The oldest layer at this site, Layer XI, is dated to the Late Mesolithic (Goriunova and Khlobystin, 1991, p. 42) and shows a combination of Mesolithic features as well as charac teristics believed to be diagnostic of the oncoming Neolithic. The former include the lack of arrowheads and the presence of prismatic blades and various tools on them (angle burins, borers, and blades for composite tools), wedge-shaped and pseudo wedge-shaped microcores, multifaceted and transverse burins, and end scrapers on spalls. According to Goriunova and Khlobystin (1991, p. 42), all these artifacts are quite frequent. On the other hand, the use of grinding in the manufacture of slate shanks for composite fishhooks, an adze, and a stone object with perforations mark the approaching Neolithic. In Layer X, many lithic forms continue from the underlying Layer XL These include angle burins on prismatic blades, pseudo wedge-shaped and prismatic microcores, retouched prismatic blades, and end scrapers on spalls. New forms of composite fishhook shanks with lateral fastening, a ground slate knife, a fish lure, and arrowheads with straight bases, along with Net-Impressed pottery, are all representative of the Neolithic, to which this horizon is dated (Goriunova and Khlobystin, 1991, p. 43). In the following Middle Neolithic Layer IX, quite a few forms continue from earlier times (angle burins, retouched prismatic blades, slate fishhook shanks, a fish lure, and arrowheads with straight bases). However, new items are also present, such as an adze with "lugs," arrow straighteners, bifacial knives, and a nephrite adze. The authors believe that this layer represents mixed Serovo and Kitoi materials from the Middle Neolithic (Goriunova and Khlobystin, 1991, pp. 44-45). Lithics from Layers VIII and VII-II have been presented with less detail. One distinct feature of Layer VIII is the presence of arrowheads with oval or concave bases and symmetrical or asymmetrical barbs (Gor iunova and Khlobystin, 1991, p. 47). Another is perimeter notching on</page><page sequence="37">Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of the Lake Baikal Region 135 some fishhook shanks (Goriunova, 1984b, p. 5). Layers VII-II feature chisel-like tools, nephrite knives, fine-grained abrasive tools, bifaces for composite tools, subtriangular scrapers, and fish lures. Entirely new are leaf-shaped and laurel leaf-shaped arrowheads (Goriunova, 1984b, p. 6). These two horizons have been dated to the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, respectively. Radiocarbon Evidence Radiocarbon dating was slowly integrated into Lake Baikal archaeol ogy through the 1970s (Veksler and Putans, 1974; Khlobystin, 1978). All dates available through the early 1980s were first discussed by Konopatskii (1982, pp. 70-80) and have recently been examined by Michael (1992a). I therefore refer only briefly to Konopatskii's study. Of the 23 reported Neolithic and Early Bronze age determinations, only 12 originated from well-defined and, in my opinion, meaningful con texts (Konopatskii, 1982, pp. 70-80): 8 from graves (Table III) and 4 from habitation layers (Table II). The remainder came from features of unknown or uncertain cultural association. Despite the small number of dates and the questionable cultural context of some, and regardless of the quite large gap between the two dates for the same Kitoi grave (Table III, Part 2, Nos. 12, 14), the evidence seemed to indicate that the Kitoi culture could have been older than Serovo. The Serovo-Glazkovo sequence was generally con firmed. No dates for the Isakovo culture were reported, thus leaving the question of its age essentially open. In sum, this first attempt to estimate absolute ages of burial complexes, although rather inconclusive, indicated that future, more extensive dating might bring some radical changes to the status quo. Burial Sites In the 1980s, Mamonova and Sulerzhitskii (1986, 1989) initiated a pro ject with the goal of radiocarbon dating Neolithic and Early Bronze Age graves from the region. In this project, the use of human bones from graves substantially alleviated the problem of association?a common problem with earlier dating. A total of 117 samples representing all burial groups and distinct areas of the region was dated (Mamonova and Sulerzhitskii, 1989). A few preliminary clarifications are necessary. First, in this set of dates, seven were labeled by the authors as unreliable, but because the reasons for this were not given, all these dates are presented in Table III (Part 1</page><page sequence="38">136 Weber Nos. 1, 14, 30; Part 2, Nos. 1, 2, 16; and Part 3, No. 25). Also, when ap proached from a wider regional perspective, some of the dates lose their suspect or outlying status (e.g., Table III, Part 1, No. 1). Second, three de terminations that used samples combining bones from more than one in dividual are less useful than the remaining ones (Table III, Part 1, No. 38; Part 2, Nos. 16, 20). Third, Mamonova and Sulerzhitskii (1989) have shown Bratskii Kamen' Grave 18 Burial 2 as the provenience for the GIN-4468 date, but it should most likely be Grave 19 Burial 2. At this locality, ac cording to Okladnikov (1976, pp. 140-143), Grave 18 contained only one individual, while Grave 19 had three. The latter provenience has been ac cepted here (Table III, Part 1, No. 25). In sum, however, the overall large number of radiocarbon determinations available today renders all these problems negligible. The results of this project are graphically presented in Figs. 12-14, which plot uncalibrated C14 dates and their 1 ? SD values separately for three regional groups: the Angara, Lake Baikal, and Upper Lena basins. According to Mamonova and Sulerzhitskii (1989, pp. 30-31), the following are the most important results of this project: (1) The antiquity of all burial complexes as defined by Okladnikov is substantially greater than previously thought; (2) the duration of the Glazkovo culture is 2.5 to 3 times longer than assumed; and (3) the Kitoi culture dates to the sixth millennium BC and precedes the Isakovo culture. Radiocarbon dating supports the follow ing sequence. Kitoi culture: Sixth millennium BC. Isakovo culture: From the end of the fifth to the beginning of the fourth millennium BC. Serovo culture: Fourth millennium BC. Glazkovo culture: From the end of the fourth to the end of the third millennium BC. In essence, the authors uphold the original definitions of archaeologi cal cultures of the region as well as the notion of unilinear cultural evolu tion, despite strong evidence to the contrary: The dates for Isakovo and the early stages of Serovo overlap, as do the determinations for early Glaz kovo and late Serovo (Table III, Figs. 12-14) (Mamonova and Sulerzhitskii, 1989, Fig. 4). Living Sites Absolute dating of settlement deposits is particularly important be cause of the emphasis on pottery in culture historical studies during the past few decades and continued efforts to correlate settlement with mor</page><page sequence="39">Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of the Lake Baikal Region 137 tuary data. However, the current state of radiocarbon dating of living sites in the Lake Baikal region is reminiscent of that of burial complexes a dec ade or so ago. Generalizations are difficult to make because of the small number of dates and lack of detailed information about their cultural con text. In the following discussion, I refer to a total of 24 radiocarbon de terminations from eight archaeological sites (Table II). Five dates from Mesolithic strata in the Lake Baikal region are included as well to provide a better frame of reference for the lower boundary of the Neolithic?a relevant issue, particularly in view of the early age of the Kitoi culture. Also, five other dates for two sites in the Yenisei basin (Kazachka and Niasha) are presented because of the apparent similarity in pottery to Lake Baikal and possible Middle Neolithic connections between the two regions. These dates, however, need to be used with caution due to the distance separating the two areas and the lack of any specific evidence about the nature of this possible link. Since the material presented in Table II has so far not been assessed within a wider culture historical context, the fol lowing paragraphs mainly provide description of this evidence. Its general significance is evaluated later in the Discussion section of the paper. First, I would like to comment on the cultural context of some of these dates. Overall, the dates appear quite acceptable in that there are no evi dent outliers or suspect determinations. Even the dates for Ulan-Khada, which at first seem somewhat contradictory, are not entirely out of line when we consider that many authors treat Layers II to VIII as a single stratigraphic unit deposited during a relatively short period of very intensive accumulation of eolian material, despite an overall thickness of 1.20-1.50 m (Khlobystin, 1978; Goriunova, 1984b; Vorob'eva and Vasil'eva, 1986; Goriunova and Khlobystin, 1991). Radiocarbon dates seem to justify this approach. Layer VII at Gorelyi Les was initially reported as Early Neolithic be cause of the presence of Net-Impressed and Khaita pottery (Savel'ev et aL, 1974, p. 164), but this association was never later confirmed. According to Berdnikova and others (1991, pp. 29-30), this layer does not contain pottery and is Late Mesolithic. Savel'ev and Goriunova (1994, personal communi cation) also confirm that the pottery found its way into Layer VII due to postdepositional disturbances, which were not accounted for in the earlier site report. In this article, the latter explanation is accepted. A similar problem is apparent in the dates for the Early Neolithic lay ers from Sagan-Zaba on Lake Baikal. Again, it is possible (Goriunova, 1994, personal communication) that mechanical disturbances are responsi ble for the presence of pottery in the very early Layers IV and V. Thus, these two dates (Table II, No. 4, 7) will have to be excluded from the dis cussion, or at least need to be treated with caution, until more thoroughly</page><page sequence="40">'JJ 0' Table III.

The usefulness of one more radiocarbon date needs to be evaluated as well, namely, that for Layer I at Khuzhir (Table II, No. 14). According to Konopatskii (1982, pp. 32-33), the two habitation layers at this site, which are separated by a sterile stratum, produced an assemblage of pottery with net and comb impressions, stab-and-drag ornamentation, and depres sions around the rim, as well as a morphologically unique bilaterally barbed bone harpoon with an attachment hole and an asymmetric arrowhead with a concave base. Thus, the date for Khuzhir Layer I is of little use in our study because it is unclear to which of the two cultural levels the above description applies. This leaves us with 11 radiocarbon determinations for the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age living floors from the entire Lake Baikal region.

The first impression is that, although the dates are few in number, they quite evenly cover the period from 9000 to 2000 BC. The oldest dates, ranging from about 9000 to 6000 BC, come from the Mesolithic horizons at Ust'-Belaia, Gorelyi Les, and Ityrkhei (Table II, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8). Both Ust'-Belaia dates are from the so-called "combined" Mesolithic stratum, which produced stone assemblages with features typical of Neolithic technology, such as arrow heads, microliths, and polished slate tools, but no pottery (Medvedev, 1966, p. 46; Medvedev et ai, 1971, pp. 56-74). The earliest pottery of the region is that of the Net-Impressed and Khaita styles, both known from Gorelyi Les, which was radiocarbon dated to the beginning of the early sixth millennium BC (Table II, Nos. 9, 11; Fig. 15). On Lake Baikal itself, however, the earliest ceramic layers of Ulan Khada and Ityrkhei yielded Net-Impressed pottery only. In the somewhat distant Yenisei basin (Kazachka), the two styles cooccur as well. Unfortu</page><page sequence="47">Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of the Lake Baikal Region 145 nately, none of these layers has a radiocarbon date (Fig. 15). Thus, on the basis of the available evidence, I accept that Net-Impressed and Khaita pottery both mark the beginning of the Early Neolithic in the region, with the stipulation that their ages may not perfectly overlap. Younger stages of these two styles are not very well dated either; the styles probably con tinue till about 2000 BC. Radiocarbon dates for Gorelyi Les and Ulan-Khada (Table II, Nos. 15, 16, 19, 20, 22-24) indicate that the period from about 4000 BC is char acterized by a proliferation of various pottery traditions such as Net II, Khaita, Comb, PosoPsk, and Ust'-Belaia. The beginnings of the Pearl style date back to sometime around the first half of the third millennium BC (Fig. 16). DISCUSSION In the preceding sections, I limited narration to the presentation of recent advances in the study of culture history in the Lake Baikal region, with a focus on field projects and recovered archaeological material, as well as on various views, models, or interpretations proposed by Russian scholars. I now attempt to furnish a more critical summary of the current state of Neolithic and Early Bronze Age research in the area. The following issues are discussed in more detail: the beginnings of the Neolithic, the role of the Kitoi culture, the correlation of burial complexes with habitation deposits, and the issue of the Early Bronze Age. Finally, a revised model of the culture history for the area is presented. In this discussion, frequent reference is made to Fig. 16, which plots ranges of the major chronological divisions for the Neolithic and Early Bronze Ages, the burial complexes, and the ceramic styles. Following the early recommendation of Gerasimov, later also advocated by Zubkov, and finally, supported by radiocarbon data, I treat Isakovo and Serovo graves as one group and refer to it as the Serovo complex. With regard to pottery, only six distinct traditions are shown, i.e., Net-Impressed I and II, Khaita, Comb, Posol'sk, Ust'-Belaia, and Pearl. For simplicity, the Podostorozhnoe and Stab-and-Drag styles have been included with Comb and Ust'-Belaia pottery, respectively. Also, since the radiocarbon evidence (Table III) does not imply any substantial regional differences in the dating of grave com plexes, and dates for living sites are scarce, the entire Lake Baikal region is treated as a whole. Three radiocarbon dates for the unclassified Neolithic graves, two suspect Kitoi dates, and three outlying dates (Table II, Part 1, Nos. 15, 49; Part 2, Nos. 12, 14; Part 3, Nos. 2, 3, 15, 24) were not used in plotting ranges for the burial complexes.

Beginning of the Neolithic In the Lake Baikal region, the period of the Mesolithic/Neolithic tran sition is characterized by gradual cultural change, primarily because of the retention of the traditional foraging mode of subsistence. This is very dif ferent from other parts of the world, where the Neolithic saw a series of substantial changes resulting from the adoption of animal and/or plant do mesticates. For the Lake Baikal area, various scholars have emphasized a continuity in technology that is so marked that Early Neolithic stone as semblages are sometimes undistinguishable from Late Mesolithic collec tions (Medvedev, 1966, 1969a, b; Khlobystin, 1969; Medvedev et ai, 1971, 1975; Svinin, 1974). All major technologies and techniques, such as mi crolithization, blade manufacture, stone polishing, composite fishhooks, net fishing, and the bow and arrow, have deep roots in the Mesolithic back ground. For these reasons, Khlobystin (1965, pp. 273-279), for example, put forward a notion about a separate stage in the prehistory of the Lake Baikal region, the so-called preceramic Neolithic period. Consequently, the presence of pottery has been used as the only reliable diagnostic of the Neolithic?hence the correlation of the Neolithic with Net-Impressed I pot tery. The widely accepted dating of this transition was to the second half of the fifth millennium BC (Khlobystin, 1978; Generalov, 1979; Zubkov, 1982; Goriunova, 1984b; Sinitsyna, 1986; Savel'ev, 1989) or even later (Ok ladnikov, 1950, 1955). However, we should remember that this dating was based on the as sumption that the earliest pottery is in association with graves of the Serovo (Isakovo) culture. Today, radiocarbon dates indicate that this complex is substantially younger than the oldest pottery in the region (Fig. 16). This long-accepted association has resulted in considerable confusion, for it seems clear now that the early ceramic layers in living sites are chrono logically compatible with the Kitoi complex. Thus, the radiocarbon dates for the Early Neolithic Layer VI from Gorelyi Les push back the beginning of the Neolithic by about 1500 years, to the beginning of the sixth millen nium BC. This precedes the Serovo culture by about 1500 years. Verifica tion of the dates from Sagan-Zaba and dating of the early Neolithic strata from Ulan-Khada and Ityrkhei, both containing only Net-Impressed pot tery, would be very useful (Figs. 15 and 16).</page><page sequence="51">3 a o t-r 7000 6000 5000 4000 3000 2000 Years BC Fig. 16.

All ages are given as calibrated years BC.</page><page sequence="52">150 Weber Correlation Between Burial Complexes and Settlement Materials The next issue I would like to consider in more detail is the correlation between burial complexes and settlement deposits, a long-standing objec tive of Lake Baikal Neolithic and Early Bronze Age archaeology. Even though the evolution of mortuary practices is often independent of patterns of change in other areas of human life (Kroeber, 1927), an attempt to cor relate pottery manufacture and mortuary ritual does provide some inter esting clues about the culture history of the area. The issue has been so complex that interpretations of living floors have often contradicted each other, especially with regard to the Isakovo, Serovo, and Kitoi cultures (e.g., Ulan-Khada). Settlement correlates of Glazkovo seemingly posed fewer problems, partly because the relative chronological position of this culture was quite well established. The model which I present in the following para graphs draws upon other models discussed above and, like them, focuses primarily on correlation with pottery. However, it differs considerably with respect to the Kitoi and Serovo cultures. First, the early stages of Kitoi do not have a pottery correlate at all, as this culture predates the earliest appearance of ceramics by about 1000 years. However, during the later stage of the Kitoi complex, Net-Impressed I and Khaita are widely known in the area. Scholars have expressed a va riety of opinions regarding the settlement counterpart of the Kitoi culture (see Culture History Debate for more detail). The two most frequent ap proaches have been to associate it with the Posol'sk style (e.g., Khlobystin, 1978) or to leave the question open (e.g., Goriunova, 1984b; Goriunova and Khlobystin, 1991, p. 46). Today, there is enough evidence to refute the Kitoi-Posol'sk correlation, which resulted from Okladnikov's and Khlobys tin's early interpretation of the Ulan-Khada material. Since Kitoi graves usually do not contain pottery, both scholars inferred the Kitoi ceramic style on the assumption that Kitoi's age was between Serovo and Glazkovo. Thus, Okladnikov (1950, pp. 98-116) identified Layers IX-XI as Serovo and Layers III-VIII as Kitoi, while Khlobystin (1964a, 1969, 1978) inter preted Layer XI as preceramic Neolithic, Layer X as Serovo, Layer IX as a composite of late Serovo, Kitoi (Posol'sk pottery), and early Glazkovo materials, and Layers II-VIII as Glazkovo. The facts, however, are that (1) Kitoi and Posol'sk are separated by a gap of about 1000 years (Fig. 16); (2) of about 200 known Kitoi graves, 3 produced clay vessels [Kitoi Grave 13 (Okladnikov, 1974, p. 54)], Khuzhir Grave 3 (1972) (Konopatskii, 1982, pp. 42-43), and Lokomotiv Grave 8 (Bazaliiskii, 1990, Plate 52)], in all cases a miter-shaped pot with net im pressions; and (3) the only pottery known in the Lake Baikal region with a chronology compatible with Kitoi is Net-Impressed I and Khaita. This, I</page><page sequence="53">Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of the Lake Baikal Region 151 believe, provides a strong basis for correlation of the later Kitoi with early Net-Impressed pottery and living floors bearing this style (Figs. 15 and 16). The early stages of the Kitoi culture, on the other hand, should correspond to Late Mesolithic deposits in the area, such as Ulan-Khada, Gorelyi Les, and Ityrkhei (Fig. 15). Khaita pottery, by analogy with Net-Impressed I style, could also be associated with late Kitoi, but the question of Khaita's age is not entirely clear. The problem is that at Ityrkhei and Ulan-Khada, Khaita pottery is absent in the oldest ceramic layers (with Net-Impressed I vessels) and ap pears only in Middle Neolithic strata containing also Comb, Posorsk, and Ust'-Belaia (Stab-and-Drag) pottery. It is also unclear in what respect this Middle Neolithic version of Khaita pottery is similar to or different from its older form. In addition to this, no Kitoi graves have yet yielded Khaita pottery. Thus, the only evidence for the early age of Khaita comes from Gorelyi Les Layer VI. On this basis, I tentatively associate this style with late Kitoi, but more evidence is needed. Second, correlation of the Serovo complex with settlement materials is less problematical than it used to be, because Serovo graves now appear to be the only Middle Neolithic burial complex. Traditionally, scholars have correlated graves with miter- and egg-shaped vessels with living sites having similar vessels. However, it is now clear that Early Neolithic strata with Net-Impressed I pottery are much older than Serovo burials. Thus, it seems that Serovo associates rather with younger versions of vessels with net (Net Impressed II) or cord (Khaita) finish, which often also have smoothed sur faces and/or various forms of decor applied to their rim part. The most frequent are combinations of comb stamps and a stab-and-drag motif, both of which are known from Serovo graves as well as from living sites of similar age. In my opinion then, settlement horizons bearing various combinations of Net-Impressed II, late Khaita, Comb, and early Ust'-Belaia (Stab-and Drag) pottery should be related to the Serovo grave complex (e.g., Ulan Khada Layer IX, Gorelyi Les Layer V, Ityrkhei Layers III-IV, and Tyshkine Layers VIII-IX; Figs. 15 and 16). In this context, it is noteworthy that some scholars distinguished between early and late Net-Impressed pottery (e.g., Zubkov, 1982; Sinitsyna, 1986) even before the discovery of Kitoi's true antiquity. Okladnikov (1950, p. 207) also noted that Serovo vessels fre quently have the net impressions deliberately smoothed out. The Posorsk style is also Middle Neolithic in age, but attempts to cor relate it with graves have been less successful. If we recall the description of the Posol'sk style given by Khlobystin, it appears that this style combines elements of other Middle Neolithic pottery. For example, cord and comb impressions as well as stab-and-drag finish are typical for pottery reliably associated with Serovo. Hence, the only distinguishing feature of Posorsk</page><page sequence="54">152 Weber is the applique below the rim. Furthermore, according to Okladnikov (1950, p. 110, 1975, p. 14), one of the Serovo graves produced a clay vessel with a triangular-sectioned applique, placed below the rim and decorated with comb stamps, features characteristic of the Posol'sk style. Finally, at all of the better stratified and documented sites yielding Posol'sk, most other styles cooccur with it (Fig. 15). Thus, for these reasons, I believe that Posol'sk also be associated with the Serovo complex. In sum, the picture emerging is that of a proliferation of pottery styles during the Middle Neolithic, a phenomenon corresponding chronologically with the establishment of Serovo communities in the Lake Baikal region. The presence of this increased variation in pottery and mortuary ritual may have some social and regional connotations [such as the pattern of mutual exclusion of the Ust'-Belaia and Posol'sk styles observed by Sinitsyna (1986)], but the issue is still too speculative to be explored further here. Third, the similarities between Serovo and Glazkovo grave groups have been convincingly documented by a number of scholars. Radiocarbon evi dence strongly supports the notion of a gradual transition from Serovo to Glazkovo mortuary ritual (Figs. 12-14). Similar continuity is typical of the material from living sites and of pottery in particular (cf. Okladnikov, 1955, p. 278). Most styles known from Serovo are present during the following stage [i.e., Net-Impressed II, Khaita, Ust'-Belaia II-III (Stab-and-Drag), and Comb)], but usually show some differences in decoration. A good example is the continued decreasing density of horizontally arranged motifs in the Ust'-Belaia II and III styles. Dating of this style poses some difficulties be cause of the lack of radiocarbon dates for the Neolithic layer at the epony mous site of Ust'-Belaia. Even if available, however, such dates would have to be used with caution because materials of various ages were very likely compressed into one stratum at this site [see conflicting interpretations of this collection by Savel'ev and Medvedev (1973) and Georgievskaia (1989)]. The Kitoi Culture The Kitoi culture has always been controversial. Within the last few decades, the two most contentious issues have been age of Kitoi and its relationship with other cultures of the area. With regard to the first problem, extensive radiocarbon dating has shown that Kitoi graves are markedly older that any other burial complex in the region, with the possible exception of the few Mesolithic Khin' graves (Aksenov and Semenov, 1980), for which there are no radiocarbon dates. The available Kitoi dates fall between 6880 BC and 5130 BC [excluding the dates for Khuzhir Grave 3 (1972)], so that the Kitoi complex straddles the</page><page sequence="55">Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of the Lake Baikal Region 153 Late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic. This notion is further supported by the similar antiquity of the radiocarbon-dated Late Mesolithic layers at Gorelyi Les and Ityrkhei. Observations about cultural continuity at the Meso lithic/NeoUthic boundary (Medvedev, 1966,1969a, b; Khlobystin, 1969; Med vedev et al., 1971, 1975; Svinin, 1974), as well as similarities between Kitoi grave inventories and Late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic living site mate rials (Gorelyi Les, Georgievskaia, 1989, pp. 106-122), provide additional evi dence to support a transitional chronological position for Kitoi. The relationship of Kitoi with the other Neolithic cultures of the area looks more interesting today than ever before. The radiocarbon evidence for the entire Lake Baikal region (139 dates including determinations not yet published) shows a pattern of considerably fewer burials during the fifth millennium BC (sixth millennium BP in uncalibrated years; Figs. 12-14). This pattern might be artificial, but it is difficult to see what kind of ar chaeological practice might have produced such a bias, particularly in face of the quite large number of radiocarbon dates now available. I believe that the pattern reflects a real process, and it also correlates well with other lines of evidence. First, ever since the discovery of the Kitoi cemetery by Vitkovskii at the end of the nineteenth century, the burial ritual itself has been used to set Kitoi graves apart from other Neolithic and Early Bronze Age burials of the Lake Baikal region. Even though the entire corpus of mortuary ma terial has never been reexamined since Okladnikov's times, it appears that features such as the liberal use of ocher, deep grave pits lacking any stone furnishing, and a typical Kitoi grave inventory (e.g., composite fishhooks) continue as reliable diagnostic characteristics of the Kitoi culture. The same cannot, however, be said about the Serovo and Glazkovo complexes, which show continuity in many areas. This point had already been raised by Gerasimov (1955). Thus, in the context of radiocarbon evidence, it may be suggested that toward the end of the fifth millennium BC, a new culture represented by Serovo graves established itself in the Lake Baikal region and continued into Glazkovo times. Second, the appearance of a series of new artifacts (e.g., composite bow, fish lures, and tanged arrowheads) probably resulted from the intro duction of new technologies and food procurement techniques, the origin of which cannot be easily traced back to the preceding culture. This also suggests cultural discontinuity between Kitoi and Serovo. Third, there is also evidence from living sites of cultural discontinuity during the fifth millennium BC, primarily from pottery because the lithics require considerably more study. On those sites where Early Neolithic strata have been identified, only simple Net-Impressed pottery, sometimes accompanied by Khaita material, is present. The Middle Neolithic layers,</page><page sequence="56">154 Weber however, sport a wider variety of pottery traditions such as Comb, PosoPsk, and Stab-and-Drag in addition to the two older ones, which display new properties (Figs. 15 and 16). Net impressions are now often obliterated, hence the Net-Impressed II style, and both Net I and II often feature other decorative motifs as well. All this taken together means a relatively sudden increase in pottery variation at the onset of the Serovo culture. Finally, osteological evidence has been consistently used (Mamonova, 1973, 1980, 1983; Khartanovich, 1986; Gerasimova, 1991) to argue that Ki toi people were craniometrically very different [in Gerasimov's (1955) opin ion more archaic] from the Serovo and Glazkovo folk, who, in turn, could not be physically distinguished from each other. Mamonova, while advo cating the notion of biological incongruity between the Kitoi and the Se rovo/Glazkovo peoples, believes that Kitoi was intrusive into the region and coexisted with Serovo. Gerasimova (1991, p. 107), on the other hand, em phasizes the archaic characteristics of Kitoi crania (pronounced alveolar prognathism, strong brow ridges and mandible, receding forehead, and overall facial robusticity) that contrast with the considerably more hetero geneous and Europoid appearance of the Serovo/Glazkovo folk. On this basis, she believes that the origin of Kitoi people is in the Paleolithic, while Europoid infiltration from the West during Middle Neolithic times pro duced the physically more diverse Serovo people (Gerasimova, 1991, pp. 104-111). More recently, preliminary reports on the study of dental mor phometric and paleopathological evidence confirm that Kitoi folk are the most ancient Siberian population with Mongoloid features, that they may share a common ancestor with American Indians, and that they were sub ject to some physiological or cultural stress (Haeussler, 1993a, b). In sum, the evidence points to a period of cultural discontinuity sepa rating the Kitoi and Serovo cultures. More detailed definition and expla nation of this phenomenon requires dedicated research involving both existing collections as well as new fieldwork. At the moment, three alter native scenarios can be offered: (1) a complete depopulation of the area at the end of the Kitoi period and immigration of new groups at the be ginning of Serovo; (2) a substantial depopulation (bottleneck) during the fifth and recovery during the fourth millennium BC; and (3) a combination of the first two scenarios, that of the population bottleneck and subsequent recovery, but with the contributing participation of new groups from the outside. The last aspect of the Kitoi culture I would like to discuss is its spa tiotemporal distribution. It has been widely thought that Kitoi was a short lived phenomenon that was geographically confined to the Upper Angara basin (Khlobystin, 1978) or, at most, the Upper Angara and Lake Baikal (Zubkov, 1982). The radiocarbon dates now clearly support a duration of</page><page sequence="57">Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of the Lake Baikal Region 155 almost 2000 years, and the geographical distribution may be an artifact of archaeological fieldwork. Kitoi graves are more difficult to locate than other Neolithic graves: Because of their greater antiquity they are often substantially deeper than younger graves (e.g., the Fofanovo cemetery), and Kitoi graves do not have surface pavements. Not surprisingly, the two most important Kitoi cemeteries known (Lokomotiv and Kitoi) are in ur ban areas. In addition to their traditional concentration on the Upper Angara, Kitoi graves have now been reported from the entire Lake Baikal region (Table I). Indeed, Kitoi graves should be expected in essentially all those areas where Early Neolithic or even Late Mesolithic living sites are known. Thus, the lack of radiocarbon dates for early Kitoi in the Upper Lena basin does not mean that it was not present: There is one Kitoi date already known from the area, and dating of recently excavated graves may reveal a pattern similar to other areas. In addition, Late Mesolithic living sites are well documented on the Upper Lena (e.g., Makarovo, Aksenov, 1974). In sum, the notion that the Kitoi culture had limited geographic and chronological distributions should be abandoned. Early Bronze Age Glazkovo graves have consistently produced a small variety of metal artifacts, such as knives, fishhooks, needles, awls, tubes (needle cases), rings or bracelets, and possibly even vessels (Okladnikov, 1955, p. 28; Gerasimov and Chernykh, 1975, Table 4; Sergeeva, 1981a, p. 29). Analysis of 58 com plete and 15 fragmentary objects from 44 Glazkovo graves representing the entire Lake Baikal region led Okladnikov (1955, pp. 26-60) to distinguish between the Copper (Chalcolithic) and the Bronze Ages within the Glaz kovo culture. This was based mainly on one technological criterion: analysis of the composition of 22 artifacts revealed elevated levels of tin in six of them [from 3.25 to 10.80% (Okladnikov, 1955, Table 4)], implying a famili arity with the casting technique and intentional addition of tin. These six artifacts were assigned to the Bronze Age, while the remainder, made of native copper using hammering or casting techniques, were classified as Chalcolithic (Okladnikov, 1955, pp. 57-58). Both periods were squeezed into the four or five centuries allotted to the Glazkovo culture (Fig. 2). Although more recent work on the subject (Gerasimov and Chernykh, 1975, p. 43, Table 4; Sergeeva, 1981a, b) has confirmed Okladnikov's findings, the chronological division of the Glazkovo metal industry is still based on typological criteria.</page><page sequence="58">156 Weber The radiocarbon dates for Glazkovo graves (Table III) shed no light on the date, or even validity, of the copper/bronze transition, because there are no compositional data available for metals from dated burials. We can say only that the nine radiocarbon dates associated with these artifacts range between 3440 BC and 1620 BC (Table III, Part 1, Nos. 26, 32, 38, 42, 43; Part 2, Nos. 26-28; Part 3, Nos. 16, 25). This means that copper and/or bronze working was known in the Lake Baikal region much earlier than was suggested by Okladnikov and most subsequent researchers, even including those who place the origin of the Glazkovo complex in the Late Neolithic (Figs. 8 and 11). Summary The above reconsideration of major issues relevant for Lake Baikal Neolithic and Early Bronze Age prehistory, presented in the context of new radiocarbon evidence, leads me to offer the following revised model of culture history (Fig. 16): Late Mesolithic This period marks the origin of the Kitoi burial complex, whose habi tation component is best represented by aceramic layers at sites such as Gorelyi Les, Ulan-Khada, and Ityrkhei. It dates from approximately 6800 to 5800 BC and should be considered a direct continuation from earlier periods. Geographically, the early (aceramic) stage of the Kitoi culture en compasses the entire Lake Baikal region. Early Neolithic This period, dated from 5800 to 4900 BC, is defined by the introduc tion of pottery by Kitoi people. Oval and miter-shaped vessels with net impressions are frequently found at living sites, but less often in graves. Khaita pottery should also perhaps be attributed to this culture. Toward the end of this period, the Kitoi people, who had probably been under stress for some time, suffered a major decrease in population density and their culture declined across the entire region. Populations densities in the Lake Baikal region remained low for 700-1000 years, until about 4200 BC.</page><page sequence="59">Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of the Lake Baikal Region 157 Middle Neolithic After the period of cultural and biological discontinuity separating the Early from the Middle Neolithic, Serovo people populated the region and population densities probably exceeded those of the Kitoi culture. The mechanism of this process remains unknown, but there is some evidence for both immigration and local cultural and demographic recovery. Com pared with earlier periods, the Serovo culture had a more advanced for aging economy, different burial ritual, and stylistically more varied pottery, as represented by the Net-Impressed II, Khaita, Comb, PosoPsk, and early Ust'-Belaia styles. The period dates from about 4200 to 3000 BC. Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age This period is defined by the appearance of copper and/or bronze ob jects and dates to 3400-1700 BC. The entire period is associated with the Glazkovo culture. Continuity with, and gradual departure from, earlier Se rovo patterns can be observed in almost every aspect, including subsistence, burial ritual, pottery, and technology other than metallurgy. CONCLUSION AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH Radiocarbon dating has revolutionized Lake Baikal Neolithic and Early Bronze Age culture history and necessitated a complete revision of the cultural evolution scheme devised by Okladnikov. The following para graphs identify what are now some of the most urgent and promising areas of inquiry. The most important new issue is the apparent biocultural discontinuity during the fifth millennium BC, separating the end of the Kitoi culture and the beginning of the Serovo culture. This is somewhat ironic, since it was exactly the opposite questions (the origin of Kitoi and the end of Se rovo) that sparked most interest in the past. Considerably more research is needed, but it does seem more plausible, and consistent with some ar chaeological evidence, that there should have been at least some continuity with earlier times, rather than the more radical scenario of a complete de population of the area toward the end of Kitoi. Some scholars (SavePev and Medvedev, 1973; Sinitsyna, 1986) have suggested that regional variation in social organization of Neolithic com munities is reflected in the variation in burial ritual and pottery. Mobility</page><page sequence="60">158 Weber patterns can either enhance or obscure any spatial regularity in the archae ological record which might be associated with regional variation in social organization. Priority should thus be given to the issues of subsistence and mobility patterns, since it will be possible to gain insight into patterns of social organization only through a better understanding of these aspects of foraging adaptations. The last issue that, in my opinion, should be addressed in more detail is the beginnings of the Bronze Age. The advent of the new technology was certainly associated with the Glazkovo people, but their exact role in this process, and the time depth and dynamics of the process itself, are not well known. The wealth of the archaeological record and the radiocarbon revolu tion have created new research opportunities for archaeologists in the Lake Baikal region. The potential for modern analytical and laboratory tech niques involving mortuary, lithic, ceramic, faunal (Weber et al 1991, 1993), and human biological data is enormous (Lam, 1993a, b; Lam and Weber, 1993; Weber and Lam, 1993), but opportunities for inquiry into theoretical aspects also exist. Issues such as the correlation of burial and living assem blages, linearity of human cultural evolution, and role of mortuary evidence in prehistoric reconstructions can all be explored in this region. However, I would like to stress the need for research that is truly multidisciplinary, in both approach and methodology, to solve the most intriguing issues that are emerging in the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of Lake Baikal. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This project is a part of a long-term research program on "Diet, Sub sistence, Social Structure, and Burial Practices of Holocene Foragers in the Lake Baikal Region" funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Re search Council of Canada. Additional support was granted by the Associa tion of Universities and Colleges of Canada and the Central Research Fund of the University of Alberta. Drs. O. I. Goriunova, A. K. Konopatskii, G. I. Medvedev, and N. A. Savel'ev, and Mr. V I. Bazaliiskii and Ms. N. E. Berdnikova, were all of invaluable help while conducting research in Irkutsk and Novosibirsk. I am very grateful for their cooperation. Also, I would like to thank Drs. Ruth Gruhn and Raymond Le Blanc, and Mr. David Link, for their editorial assistance and valuable comments. Mr. Darryl Bereziuk prepared the map, for which I am also very thankful. Finally, I would also like to give my thanks to the two anonymous reviewers who mercilessly exposed a number of shortcomings in an earlier version of the paper. Whatever has still gone unnoticed is exclusively mea culpa.</page><page sequence="61">Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of the Lake Baikal Region 159 REFERENCES Aksenov, M. P. (1974).
