A SUMMARY1 EGYPTIAN mythology appears most intricate in both texts and pic- tures. I should like to make clear in this paper that a significant sector of its theological foundation, however, ap- pears simple enough and was brought forth in the first half of the third millen- nium B.C. The paper is based on my research in the earliest Egyptian theology, which ex- tended over the last five years. Only a few short relevant studies, which dealt with pregnant individual problems of this research, were published during that time.2 Their themes were selected inci- dentally out of a great choice, and their goal was to establish a foothold. Still the results fitted into a pattern which was un- expected and surprising in its simplicity. Because the papers give the impression of a certain incoherence, the reader cannot easily recognize their common essence. Thus the summary which is presented in the first section of this paper will perhaps be useful. The second section is designed to substantiate those of my views which I have not discussed before, based mainly on the Pyramid Texts.3 1 Section I of this paper was first delivered as a lecture in the Oriental Club of Philadelphia in No- vember 1958. A few elaborations on certain points have been added for the publication, and some ques- tions which had been left open in the lecture have been answered meanwhile by the discussions which are presented here in Section II. 2 "The Original Meaning of mC'-hrw," JNES, XIII (1954), 21-51.

Bonnet, Reallexikon der agyptischen Religions- geschichte (Berlin, 1952) and H.

This goal prompted me to employ the clumsy method of presenting the results of my studies in nearly the same way in which I reached them, one after the other, and to add a historical summary and some questions of a more general character. The fact that this first design has been pre- served in spite of its methodological im- perfection makes it clear that the goal has remained the same as it was first. Egyptian religion is, I think, completely free of those logics which eliminate one of two contradictory concepts and press re- ligious ideas into a system of dogmas.4 The lack of dogmatical systems arouses the suspicion that at any time of Egyptian history any change of any theological con- cept might have taken place. In fact, the tendency to continual change has been proved in several regards.5 But the mere possibility that it existed necessarily di- rects the method of the research on the earliest concepts. It restricts the research to the earliest sources. Any religious con- cept which is not attested before, let us say, 2300 B.C.6 may be used as a criterion solely for the results of a study concern- ing those concepts which are attested be- fore 2300 B.C. The invaluable Pyramid Texts had been transmitted for centuries before they were cut in stone around 2400 B.C. in five copies. In their present form, therefore, they conspicuously con- tain both earlier and later ideas, and changes of mythological concepts. While they represent the most important source for the studies of the theology of the first two thirds of the third millennium, they cannot serve as the starting point with re- spect to those of its first third, the early dynastic period. There exists one concept which cer- tainly belongs in the early dynastic pe- riod. This is the concept of the king of Egypt being the falcon Horus. As to the date of this concept, it was naturally not earlier than the institution of kingship in Egypt, which was established about 3000 B.C., and it is evidenced as early as the First Dynasty. Let us first discuss this early concept of Horus. In addition to the idea that Horus, the falcon, was the king of Egypt, there exist- ed some other concepts of Horus, namely, Horus the lord of heaven, and Horus the son of Osiris. We shall see later that Horus the son of Osiris is merely a mythological aspect of Horus the king of Egypt. To be- gin with, we may disregard him and like- wise the local varieties of the falcon on pp. 481-501 [Berlin, 1956]). The expression "Sethe's comment," which is often used in Section II, of course refers to K. Sethe, Uebersetzung und Kom- mentar zu den altagyptischen Pyramidentexten, Vols. I- IV (Gltickstadt-Hamburg-New York, apparently with- out date). 4 The picture of the Divine Cow and the commen- tations in the seventeenth chapter of the Book of the Dead are briefly discussed accordingly in Artibus Asiae, XX (1957), 93, in my review of A. Piankoff, The Shrines of Tut-Ankh-Amun. See below, Section II, o, with n. 40, for the Divine Cow and references to relevant publications. 5 The fact that some changes of concepts took place in the history of Egyptian religion has been known for a long time; see, for instance, the myth of Horus according to Bonnet, Reallexikon, pp. 311-12. It was S. Schott, however, who first made it clear that the readiness to change was a pregnant characteristic of Egyptian religion: Mpthe und Mythenbildung im alten Aegypten (Leipzig, 1947). 6 I may add that the time between 2300 and 2200 B.c. really indicates a new epoch in the funerary litera- ture upon which our knowledge of Egyptian mythol- ogy depends first of all. It was then that the latest Pyramid Texts were recorded and the first so-called Coffin Texts appeared, which seem to have influenced also the texts of the pyramid of king Aba. See Bonnet, Reallexikon, s. v. "Sargtexte," for the difference be- tween Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts. I may further refer to A. Rusch, "Die Theologie des Osiris und die Herakleopoliten," in WZKM, LIV (1957), 161-67, for a striking example of the influence of the political entity, Herakleopolis, on the Coffin Texts, and to my remarks in ZAS, LXXXII, 7, for the literary mood of thinking of those who worked them out in detail, as contrasted with the rituals upon which the Pyramid Texts are based.</page><page sequence="3">EGYPTIAN THEOLOGY IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. 171 Horus (see Section II, b). The identity of Horus the lord of heaven with Horus the king of Egypt has been accepted by all of us. It must be re-examined on the basis of the early documents exclusively. During the first three dynasties, these two Horuses occur mostly in different contexts which do not allow for any con- clusions about their identity (see Section II, a). On the ivory comb of king Horus Serpent of the First Dynasty, however, the falcon Horus is represented twice: in the lower register he stands upon the sym- bol of the royal palace as the king, in the upper register he stands in a boat beneath which two wings representing the sky are spread. No difference in the forms of these two falcons is shown. Correspondingly, the mere name Horus written with the word sign of the falcon indicates either Horus in the Pyramid Texts,' and there the identity of the earthly and the celes- tial Horus is evident.8 To begin with, therefore, we should assume that the identity existed in the earliest historical period, and I think this assumption has been fully verified by the conclusions which are based upon it. Furthermore, of course, this, like any other factual conclu- sion which I am going to propose here, is either supported or else not contradicted by later sources to the best of my knowl- edge. As to the meaning of the identity of Horus, there is good reason to make it conceivable by calling it a trinity of Horus the falcon, the king of Egypt, and the lord of heaven (see Section II, para- graph b). What exactly is the meaning of Horus the lord of heaven? It has been assumed on the ground of what I think is very de- batable evidence that, while the falcon was the sun, the sky was thought to be represented by the wide-spread wings of the same falcon. One of the lesser objec- tions against this view is the fact that the Egyptians usually conceived the sky as a female while Horus himself and the old word for "wing" are masculine. Another objection has transpired only very recent- ly, for it has become evident that Horus was not primarily the sun. The heavenly Horus was a star as well as the sun, and perhaps also the moon. It seems as if he was that celestial body which appeared conspicuous either at day or night. The idea that his wings represented the sky does not well fit into this concept of Horus, which was borne out by specula- tion rather than by observation. Horus was called "the lord of the sky," "the one who presides over the sky," and he was the permanent ruler of the sky, who un- like the sun did not vanish at night-time. See Section II, a, for the heavenly Horus and II, c, for the wings. The trinity of Horus the falcon, the lord of heaven, and the earthly king, may be called the concept of the universal god if we accept the definition that the uni- versal god rules heaven and all the other gods and the whole earth, and is wor- shiped and served by mankind (see Sec- tion II, d). We shall discuss the univer- sality of Horus more thoroughly later. At the present initial point of our reasoning it is sufficient to say that the king being Horus was the highest god. Now, the Pyramid Texts commemorate the transi- tion of the earthly king into the world be- yond, that is, the burial of the king and his transfiguration. Thus they answer the very significant question of what hap- pened to the highest god, Horus, the king of Egypt, when his human body died. Ac- cording to the Pyramid Texts, the king was then no longer Horus. He was then 7 For instance, Pyr. 1258 b and 888 c. Writing with phonograms is rare, e.g., Pyr. 487 a. The only problem involved is that of Itrw and the word sign (Pyr. 17 b, 27 b, 28 b, 1686 a, 1690 b). This does not concern the subject of this paper, however. 8 Pyr. 1258 a-b; see Section II, a.</page><page sequence="4">Atum the very old one, the primeval being I I Shu *Tefnut air and moisture the female that carry the sky supplement of Shu Geb Nut the earth, the sky the representative of the former kings Osiris *Is is Seth Nephthys the growing grain, "the throne" a royal deity, "that which cultivation, desert, rules in the deceased king murderous heat the house" I ,.

And Osiris like Horus was called "the lord of heaven" and "the great god" meaning "the greatest god" in the Pyramid Texts (see Section II, e and f for "the lord of heaven" and "the great god" respectively). I think we may ex- press the situation as follows: while the individual king was only Horus during his reign on earth, the mythical aspect of the king was both Horus and Osiris (see Section II, g). The king in his mythical appearance as Horus and Osiris was an eternal god ac- cording to the Pyramid Texts. I may call him NN which stands for the personal name, in the following quotations9 as else- where in this paper. "The mother of NN was pregnant with him who was in the Naunet.1o NN was given birth by his father Atum before heaven came into be- ing, before earth came into being, before mankind (rmt) came into being, before the gods were born, before death came into being" (Pyr. 1466). Furthermore, "NN was born in the primeval ocean be- fore heaven came into being, before earth came into being, before 'mnti came into being, before unrest came into being, be- fore that fear came into being which came into being because of the eye of Horus. NN is the unequaled one who belongs to the great corporation which was born in the beginning" in Heliopolis" (Pyr. 1040- 41). According to these quotations, the king was born in the primeval beginning and likewise his father Atum and the Great Corporation. This corporation, ac- cording to other passages, apparently was the court which performed the nomina- tion of the king by acclamation and, therefore, was naturally looked on as hav- ing originated in the mythical past not later than he himself; I have discussed this corporation, which apparently was also called '"the Ennead," "the divine court of the Nine," in Section II, h. The cosmogonic concept of Atum and his descendants (Fig. 1) is attested im- plicitly already in the Pyramid Texts; this is discussed in Section II, i. In contradic- tion to what we are accustomed, I prefer to call it either the pedigree of the gods or the lineage of Horus, and not the Ennead, because the identification of the pedigree with the Ennead is most debatable. It would be methodologically wrong to pre- serve it, therefore. See Section II, j, for the concept of the Ennead. All the figures of the pedigree are cosmic deities except Isis and Nephthys, whom we may leave alone here. I have pointed to the problem involved in these female deities in Sec- tion II, k. The pedigree was looked on by the Egyptians as a cosmogonic concept with Atum being the primeval deity. The main cosmogonic events of this concept were the following: Atum, the very old one, engendered Shu and Tefnut by himself; Shu separated heaven from earth by elevating his daughter Nut from her husband and brother Geb; Seth killed his brother Osiris and was punished by Horus. The first two of these three stories, which concern the first to the third gen- erations, are cosmological tales in an an- thropomorphic form; see Section II, 1. The story concerning the fourth and fifth generations, however, is a human story which appears to be incidentally inter- mingled with cosmic ideas; see Section II, m. Correspondingly, the birth of Osiris from Nut and Geb, not to speak of his brother and sisters, seems to be mentioned usually and perhaps always as a genealogi- 9 The king is here called "NN," and not "Osiris NN." I do not know to what degree the addition or omission of the denotation "Osiris" is significant in any context. 10 Naunet is the upside-down-sky or "antisky" which appears to be located beneath the earth. 11 The meaning of m b34 as "in the beginning," and not "in the past," in this context is attested by the statement, in Pyr. 1462 d-1463, that the Corporation originated in the very beginning. See Section II, h.</page><page sequence="6">174 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES cal and not a cosmic fact in the Pyramid Texts, and this situation did not change much, if ever, later on. In conclusion, a break between the third and fourth gen- erations of the pedigree of the gods has always appeared evident,12 and this was made still more conspicuous by some strange features. First, if we think in terms of a cosmogonical tale, it appears most striking that Nut after she had borne four children to Geb was separated from her husband by their father; it would be much more plausible if this new develop- ment was brought forth by one of her sons. Secondly, the figure of Geb is strangely ambiguous. While he represents the earth, he appears more often as a ruler in heaven and as the heir to the father of the gods, Atum. It might look as though he was thought to have been the first king on earth perhaps in an earlier version of the cosmogonic concept, while in the pres- ent concept evidently Osiris was the first king. A third incongruity is found in the fourth and fifth generations: Seth is some- times called the brother of Horus and sometimes the brother of Osiris, in what appears to be the same context (see Sec- tion II, n). Finally, the whole concept had become unintelligible to us because we identified it with the Ennead, the body of nine deities, which seemed to eliminate the youngest and tenth mem- ber, Horus. While these discrepancies of the pedi- gree in its understanding as a cosmogony are evident and have never been satis- factorily explained, it may be useful to mention another feature of the concept of the pedigree of the gods, which also seems to indicate an inconsistency, though wrongly. Virtually every member of the pedigree appears also, in the Pyramid Texts, as the descendant of another deity in contradiction with the pedigree. For in- stance, Pyr. 1466, which I have quoted above, expressly says that Atum engen- dered the king meaning Horus or Osiris, who in the pedigree appear in the fourth and fifth generations. This variety of con- cepts is no problem, however. It is in ac- cordance with the prominent feature of Egyptian religion that mythological con- cepts are very often contradictory. Nei- ther the pedigree nor any other concept of Egyptian theology was a dogma strict- ly speaking. The two aspects of the divine king as the son of Atum and the son of Osiris, for instance, represented two dif- ferent mythological approaches to the understanding of the mythological con- cept of the divine king. They supple- mented but did not exclude each other. See to these questions Section II, o. The inconsistencies in the pedigree which I mentioned above, namely, the break after the third generation, the ac- tivity of Shu, the character of Geb, and the fact that Seth was the brother of both Osiris and Horus, are eliminated if we interpret the pedigree as the concept of a lineage which was developed from Horus upward, and not as a cosmogonical tale which started with Atum. My interpreta- tion'3 with Horus as the starting point was prompted by the realization that pre- sumably it was the death of the god, Ho- rus, and not his life, which first caused questioning and speculations. To make this point I am going to picture a situa- tion. I wish to stress, however, that this situation is completely imaginary except the fact that I think the Pyramid Texts give evidence that, in the early dynastic period, the king who in the Old Kingdom was as a rule the bodily son of his prede- cessor, was nominated by acclamation in the court, the corporation of Heliopolis. 12 Kees, Gfitterglaube, p. 227, calls this break, "die kiinstliche Nahtstelle der heliopolitanischen Kosmo- gonie." 13 It was first suggested in JAOS, LXXIV, 38-39, with a comment on Osiris as the grain and presented in extenso in ZAS, LXXX, 88-89.</page><page sequence="7">EGYPTIAN THEOLOGY IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. 175 Evidently, a procedure took place in court before the nomination. For references see Section II, beginning of h. Let us imagine that immediately after the death of the king the crown prince and heir to the throne appeared in the court of Heliopolis and claimed that he was the king, the god Horus. A ceremonial ques- tioning in the manner of the following would have been apt to verify his claim. Question on the part of the court: "You are a human being, to our knowledge, and not a god. It is your father who is the Horus." Answer on the part of the crown prince: "I am Horus, the son of Osiris, because my father died and has become the god Osiris. For as a grain his body is buried in the earth, and as the vegetation his spirit grows upward into heaven." Q. "How did it come to pass that the god, Horus, died?" A. "The death of the god could not possibly be effected except by murder." Q. "Who was so powerful as to kill the god?" A. "This was his only equal, his broth- er, the royal god Seth." Q. "You have said that Osiris, your father, is buried in the earth and at the same time lives above in heaven. What does this mean?" A. "The king originated in eternity and he has gone back to eternity, that is, to his parents. Geb, the earth, is his father, and Nut, the heaven, is his mother." Q. "Eternity is oneness. But Geb and Nut are separated from each other. How could they possibly be the parents of Osiris?" A. "One who was more powerful than they separated them, their father, Shu, who raised Nut up from Geb." Q. "Thus Shu is the god who you claim is your first ancestor?" A. "My first ancestor is the primeval god, Atum, who is the father of Shu." If we understand the so-called cosmog- ony of Heliopolis in this manner as the establishment of the lineage of Horus, it becomes at once clear why Seth was the brother of both Horus and Osiris and why it was the father that separated Nut from Geb. What is more, it was only on the basis of this understanding that the prob- lem of the double character of Geb as the earth and the prototype of kingship has been satisfactorily solved; see Section II, q. It is true that the female members, Tefnut, Isis, and Nephthys are not men- tioned. It can be shown that they are in- cidental figures: Tefnut, to supplement Shu as a couple in contrast to the single one, Atum; Isis and Nephthys, in conse- quence of the human character of the story of Osiris and Horus (see Section II, 1 and k respectively). I do not think any argument has been, or will be, raised against the opinion that the pedigree was developed from Horus upward to Atum and not from Atum down to Horus. With this presupposition we may conclude that this lineage of Horus originated in the concept of the divine king, Horus, in the earliest historical pe- riod of Egypt, and presumably in a ritu- al, possibly that which preceded his nomi- nation and deification on earth. The in- terpretation of this lineage as a cosmogon- ic concept was obviously suggestive and consequently adopted early. The pedigree of the gods, according to the present interpretation, was prompted by the death of the king and served to prove the divine character of his bodily son when he succeeded his father. The crown prince, born a man, became Horus not before his father had become Osiris. Osiris and Horus were by their very na- ture the royal deceased father and his liv- ing royal son. These identities of both the</page><page sequence="8">176 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES living king and his deceased father repre- sent the most pregnant concept of the Pyramid Texts and they correspond also with the mythical tale of Osiris and his posthumous son, Horus. As for the rela- tion between the theological concept of the lineage of Horus and the tale of Osiris, Isis, and Horus we may say that the tale originated solely in that concept, while other mythical aspects of Horus, Seth, and Osiris were merged into it. It is, I may say, certain that none of its major ele- ments had been carried over from any his- toric or folkloristic tale; see Section II, paragraph p. There is mainly one problem left which I am not ready to discuss, namely the genuine character of Seth and the relation which probably existed be- tween him and Horus outside of the con- cept of the pedigree. Whatever the answer will be, it will hardly alter the present in- terpretation of the pedigree as the lineage of Horus. Two other questions, however, which are very relevant to our under- standing, must be answered in this dis- cussion because their understanding rep- resented decisive steps in my earlier re- search as mentioned in the beginning of this section. First, who is this Atum to whom the lineage is traced back? Second, what is the meaning of the fact that two generations of cosmic deities connect Horus-Osiris with his ancestor Atum? According to the opinion which in one way or another all of us had accepted, Atum was a deity who was important but complex and enigmatic. His main characteristics appeared to indicate him as (1) the god creator according to the pedigree as it was interpreted as a genuine cosmogony; (2) the primeval being ac- cording to his appearance as the primeval earth-hill and his equation with the prime- val beetle, Khepri; (3) a universal god ac- cording to his name which was translated "the universe"; and (4) the sun god.14 I have reached what I think is the only pos- sible solution of the problem of Atum un- expectedly in my discussion of the god Nefertem. The god Nefertem, for whom I may refer here to Section II, paragraph r, is the primeval lotus flower which first arose out of the primeval ocean. He was closely con- nected with the god Re. The sun god Re was acknowledged, in succession to Horus, as the highest god around 2550 B.C. We shall discuss this change below. At the moment, I may comment on him as fol- lows: while Horus was at the same time the earthly king and the dominating ce- lestial body, his successor Re was exclu- sively the sun and the ruler of the uni- verse. The earthly king was then the son of Re. What was the connection of Nefer- tem with Re? The two following quotations are the only ones in the Pyramid Texts which mention Nefertem. Pyr. 266 reads: "NN (meaning the king) shines as Nefertem, who is the lotus flower at the nose of Re when Re rises on the horizon every day." Similarly, "Nefertem who is at the nose of Re every day" is mentioned in the so- called "Theology of Memphis," 1. 52 b,15 and there clearly indicated as a primeval deity. I have interpreted this phrase, I think conclusively, as follows. The fra- grance of the mythical lotus flower be- stows life on Re on every morning, and by this the event of the primeval beginning is reiterated, in which the primeval lotus gave life to the creator, Re, the sun. In this sentence, as in the following, the king is identified with Nefertem. "NN himself 14 According to H. Frankfort, Kingship and the Gods (Chicago, 1948), chap. xiii, n. 1, Atum and Re were two "different aspects of a single god manifest in the sun." While his view that Atum was the sun was justified, he was wrong in assuming that the char- acter of the sun god was genuine and most indicative of Atum. See Section II, s, for the character of Atum. 15 See below, n. 36, for references. Unfortunately, the phrase which is quoted above is omitted in ANET, p. 5.</page><page sequence="9">EGYPTIAN THEOLOGY IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. 177 is the Heliopolitan, the one that was born in Heliopolis while Re was the chief of the two Enneads, and the chief of mankind (rhyt) was Nefertem" (Pyr. 483). This sentence recalls the primeval time, in which only Re with the corporation of the Enneads existed along with the king of mankind, Nefertem, who is, according to the context, identified with the Heliopoli- tan, NN. This statement closely corre- sponds with the statement which I quoted before, that, in the primeval beginning, there existed only the king, Atum, and the corporation of Heliopolis. Evidently this earliest concept was replaced by the paral- lel one introducing Re. Let us disregard for once both the corporations of the old and of the new concept, which are dis- cussed in Section II, paragraphs h and j. Then the fact remains that, according to the old concept, the king and Atum exist- ed in the primeval beginning and, accord- ing to the new concept, Re and Nefertem. Obviously, Re in the new concept corre- sponds with the Horus-Osiris king in the old concept, either being the highest god. What is the meaning of their comple- ments, Atum beside the divine king, and Nefertem beside Re? Both names, Atum and Nefertem, can be translated. "Atum" is a participle used as a noun, and "Nefertem" is a nominal sentence with its adverbial predicate in the pseudoparticiple (old perfective). The verb which is common to both names is tm which is closely related to the Semitic tmm. Its two meanings appear contradic- tory. They are best evidenced as "to be- come non-existent" and "to be completed in number." Choosing the second mean- ing we must translate the names as fol- lows: "Atum" is "he that is completed in number," and "Nefertem" is "the Nefer is completed in number." Nefer (nfr) means something like "the new one," "the youthful one," "the regenerate one," and later on, it occurs as "lotus flower." Thus the regenerate primeval lotus flower is called a unit which was completed by absorbing a number of individuals. See- ing that Nefertem is the primeval living being, the primeval lotus flower, it is a good guess that the various forms of ap- pearance of the first living being, which had been conceived from prehistoric times, were absorbed and regenerated in the one primeval lotus flower, Nefertem. The same interpretation must then be ap- plied to Atum, "the completed one who has absorbed all the other first living be- ings." Further corroboration of this gram- matical understanding of his name, and the possibility that "the first living be- ings" might be replaced by "the gods" in the translation of the name of Atum, is offered in Section II, s. Being the head of the pedigree of the gods Atum was conceived in the appear- ance of a man, the "father of the gods." In the same time, being the completion of the first living beings he was looked on as the primeval earth-hill which, presumably according to an old tradition, first rose out of the primeval ocean and gave space to the first living being. See for these two main aspects of Atum and their varieties Section II, t, and for snake and beetle as the first living beings, paragraph u. Simi- larly Nefertem was conceived in a twofold appearance. According to the Pyramid Texts as quoted above, and in accordance with later pictures and epithets, he was the lotus flower and, at the same time, being the regenerated one he was the youthful king of Egypt. Thus both Atum and Nefertem were ar- tificially created, and this was done for the benefit of the highest god, in faithful ac- knowledgment of the old tradition that in the primeval time the first living being came into existence, and with the under-</page><page sequence="10">178 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES standing that this being was not the univer- sal god (cf. Section II, u). In both concepts, that of the Horus-Osiris king and Atum, and that of Re and Nefertem, it was the one primeval being who had given life to the highest god :Atum as the ancestor of Horus- Osiris, and Nefertem as the lotus whose fra- grance entered the nose of Re. As the givers of life, Atum and Nefertem served in like function. Consequently, the question may arise why it was necessary to reiterate the artificial concept of Atum with that of Nefertem. Why did not Atum serve as the giver of life to Re as he had served to the king Horus-Osiris? The answer is evi- dently that Atum had outgrown his pri- mary role when the concept of Re as the universal god came into existence. Being the ancestor and father of the king who was also regarded as his heir, he was some- what assimilated to, though not identified with, his offspring, Horus, the earthly king and the heavenly god; see Section II, v. The Pyramid Texts strongly suggest that Atum was already second only to Horus when Re was acknowledged as the highest god. It was on this basis that Re was identified with both Horus and Atum according to his names Re-Horus and Re- Atum, and the function of Atum as the one who first gave life to the highest god was transferred to Nefertem. The second question which the pedigree has posed is, why was the descent of Ho- rus-Osiris from Atum complicated by the insertion of two more generations al- though, in another context, the same Horus-Osiris was called the direct son of Atum? What I think is the answer to this question occurred to me incidentally, also after a long roundabout way.'" The under- standing of Atum which has been pre- sented here had eliminated our former idea that he genuinely was a god creator and lord of the universe. This prompted me to examine whether or not the concept of the universal god, which in the historic period appears first in Horus, already existed in one way or another in the pre- historic period. The answer was that a prehistoric universal god could be neither attested nor denied, while some individual cosmic concepts, mainly in form of ani- mals, apparently existed. Several weeks after I sent my manuscript to the editor I suddenly realized that, after all, the an- swer to the problem appears clearly enough in the historical concept of the pedigree. The pedigree created a human- like interrelation of virtually all cosmic concepts in whatever form they might have existed before, either isolated or in smaller groups. The lineage of Horus, the earthly king and celestial body, up to Atum, the father and first living being that arose out of the ocean, was laid through the cultivated land in the Nile valley and the sterile desert, the earth and the sky and whatever was between them. I have concluded that this lineage was conceived to indicate that all these cosmic entities were parts of, or belonged to, Horus, the universal god. If this assump- tion is right, we must inevitably conclude that the concept of god as the ruler of the universe did not exist, in Egypt, before the kingship of Horus was established around 3000 B.C. What is more, then this discov- ery of the universal god took place not by chance but in consequence of the unifica- tion of Egypt. For it was prompted by the necessity to make the universal and eter- nal character of the god Horus, the king of Egypt, conceivable. Nobody is compelled to accept my in- terpretation of the pedigree as the system- atic demonstration of the new idea that the universal god existed. Naturally, it cannot be either proved or disproved. I myself have accepted it, however. While I had not thought of it at all, it occurred to 16 MDAIK, XV, 1-12.</page><page sequence="11">EGYPTIAN THEOLOGY IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. 179 me quite incidentally. Only subsequently have I realized that it fits exactly into my understanding that religion genuinely originated in the human society and not in the individual. This opinion was first based upon another example from Egypti- an history. For the idea that the individu- al is responsible for his deeds to God origi- nated in the breakdown of the society of the Old Kingdom at the end of the third millennium. Before that, apparently the society itself had taken care of whatever question of conscience might have arisen."7 Thus a certain relationship of mankind to God was established in consequence of events which concerned the whole society at the end of the third millennium B.C. Likewise, I should say, the realization of a new aspect of God came into existence at the beginning of the same millennium, in a period which is renowned for other great achievements. May I summarize the preceding discus- sion in a brief picture of the historical de- velopment of early Egyptian theology as it appears to me in the present stage of re- search? The following concepts existed in the prehistoric period preceding the unifica- tion of Egypt. First, apparently, cosmo- gonic concepts of the first living being which emerged from the primeval ocean existed; I think that beetle and serpent are evidenced while frog, lotus flower, and egg appear probable. Second, local deities, most of them in the form of animals, are attested while others were emblems. Third, cosmic concepts of the sky as a cow and a roof existed, and most probably also other concepts of the sky, the sun, and the earth. There appeared also a cow goddess of fertility. It is a fairly well- founded assumption that the local god of the nome whose chieftain eventually be- came the king of Egypt was the falcon.18 If so, he was probably called Horus and possibly incorporated by the chieftain. I do not think he was a cosmic concept be- cause, according to my discussion in Sec- tion II, a, the historical concept of Horus as the ruler of the sky or lord of heaven was speculative rather than natural and came into existence in consequence of the unification. With the unification of Egypt the vic- tor of the wars, presumably the Horus chieftain who resided at Hierakonpolis in Upper Egypt, had become the lord of what appeared to be the inhabited world.19 However, his domain was, in the opinion of the sages, still wider. It was infinite in space and time. He was then looked on as the lord of the whole world and as an eternal god who had come into existence in the primeval beginning. This new char- acter was made conspicuous by means of the identification of the king with which- ever celestial body was dominant at day and night time, i.e., chiefly, but not exclu- sively, the sun. Furthermore, to make the new idea of a universal and eternal god conceivable in human terms, the sages united the traditional concepts of the pri- meval living being in the concept of Atum as the primeval earth-hill and at the same time they assimilated him and the cosmic 17 This is more thoroughly discussed in JNES, XIII, 23-25. 18 This is not certain, however. According to an oral communication from Dr. Baumgartel, figurines of the falcon do not occur before that latest section of the predynastic period, which cannot be clearly distinguished from the early dynastic period. Thus the existence of a prehistoric falcon god Horus does not appear well attested. 19 Evidently the early dynastic Egyptians knew of other countries as far as, or farther than, Mesopota- mia. It is a fair guess that these were thought of as belonging to the Egyptian king, though without politi- cal implications. I think that the idea that the Egypti- an king virtually was the lord of all the foreign coun- tries was expressed in later periods. It appears indica- tive of this view that the hieroglyphic ideogram Ld means "desert" and "foreign country" at the same time; after all, the desert personified in Seth belonged to the realm of the Horus king, according to my inter- pretation of the pedigree.</page><page sequence="12">180 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES deities to the human appearance of the highest god, the king, in a human-like lineage. This lineage on the one hand proved the character of the king as the ruler of the universe and made it also clear that the death of the king did not contra- dict his divine character. On the contrary, it was the king's transition from Horus into Osiris which confirmed his existence as an eternal being. Atum, the very old one, was assimilated to Horus as the ruler of Egypt and the heavenly god. I think it is useful to add that the only complex con- cept which was involved in the realization of the existence of an eternal and univer- sal god, namely, the lineage of Horus, most probably originated in the perform- ance of royal rites; it was not arbitrarily invented. The concept of this lineage origi- nated in the very existence of Horus the living king of Egypt and the inhabited world, and, therefore, it could not pos- sibly have been carried over from a pre- historic local chieftain. I do not think that the character of the king as the supreme being made him an autocrat who was free to rule the country at his own pleasure. The Pyramid Texts indicate conclusively, as I think, that there existed a supreme court of sorts who nominated the king. It is hard to imagine that their activity would have been re- stricted to the mere acclamation of the new king. Furthermore, presumably the king's divinity, which was necessarily wrapped up in ceremonies featuring him as the highest god, prevented rather than facilitated his activity in government. I believe, though without any evidence, that his complete divinity and effective rulership became increasingly incompat- ible, and that this caused the final replace- ment of the concept of Horus with the concept of Re for the very benefit of the royal power. The name of Re probably means noth- ing but "the sun-disk." He occurs as a deity in the names of kings from the Sec- ond Dynasty on and, more regularly, in the Fourth Dynasty. The incidental de- notation of Old Kingdom kings as "the son of Re" first occurs in the Fourth Dynasty also.20 These facts evidence that Re was acknowledged presumably in the prehistoric period and subsequently by those kings who, being Horus, were them- selves equated with the sun. While this apparent duality of solar concepts prob- ably would have been acceptable any- way,21 we have now realized (in Section II, a) that the cosmic concept of the sun, Re, who vanished in the evening and ap- peared rejuvenated in the morning, was quite different from that of Horus, the permanent ruler of the sky at both day and night time. Still, Re was naturally pushed in the background by the prominent position of Horus before Userkaf, the first king of the Fifth Dynasty, built a temple of Re in the necropolis not far from his pyramid. The dominant appearance of the sun temple at the edge of the cultivated land rivaled that of the pyramid and indicated to man- kind that the rulership of Re was estab- lished and, to begin with, was as impor- tant as that of the Horus- Osiris king.22 This change was a revolutionary act with respect to the concept of kingship but hardly directed against it. It took place about 2550 B.C., five centuries after the establishment of Egyptian kingship. 20 See Hugo Miiller, Die formale Entwicklung der Titulatur der dgyptischen Kinige (Gliickstadt, 1938), pp. 67 if. 21 See Section II, i, for the non-dogmatic character of the pedigree, and Section II, o, for the simultaneous validity of mythical concepts which to the logical mind contradict each other. 22 For the meaning of the sun temples of the Fifth Dynasty, see W. Kaiser, "Zu den Sonnenheiligtii- mern," MDAIK, XIV (1956), 104-16, and E. Winter, "Zur Deutung der Sonnenheiligttimer" in WZKM LIV (1957), 222-33. These two papers supplement each other.</page><page sequence="13">EGYPTIAN THEOLOGY IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. 181 The new concept of Re was the true successor of that of Horus since Re was identified with both Atum and Horus ac- cording to his names Re-Atum and Re- Harakhty, which latter means "Re, the heavenly Horus of the horizon in which he appears as the sun." In fact, disregarding his genuine connection with Nefertem, we may say that whatever we know of Re's mythological aspects and, mainly, his po- sition as a king was carried over from the earthly kingdom of Horus and from the concept of Atum. But the kingdom of Re was established in heaven and in the world of the gods exclusively, and this was in very contrast to the kingdom of Horus. It seems as if some entities which be- longed in the earlier period of earthly gov- ernment vanished in Egypt approximately in this period, and have survived only in the mythological concept of the kingship of Re.23 The king, who was then merely the earthly ruler, was regarded, in what we may call the theory of the government, as the son of Re, and as a mythical being he was identified with the primeval lotus, Nefertem. This latter identification might have been facilitated, or caused, by the fact that the daily morning offering, which presumably was performed by the king for the sun-god Re, was paralleled in the be- stowing of life unto Re on the part of the primeval lotus flower in the East. In addi- tion to these changes and innovations, however, the old concepts of Horus and Atum and all the auxiliary figures, and no less the prehistoric concepts, were carried on as theological entities, in accordance with the persistency of Egyptian religious thinking which was not ready to invali- date whatever had once turned out to be valid. The decisive importance of the rise of Re lay in its consequences. For both the ideas of the universal god and the earthly king were then rendered free to develop in their own rights. Once more it was in con- sequence of political changes that after a thousand years the idea of Re developed into the idea of the ruler of the empire and the King of the Gods, Amon-Re, and this culminated, by means of what appears to be the character of Amun as the invisible god, in the so-called Credo of the high- priests of Karnak around 1000 B.C.4 This represents a highly spiritual concept of the highest god whose form is hidden like the shape of the radiating sun in whom he manifests himself. This god is pictured in terms of a human-like creator and king of the universe with scarce allusions to the ancient mythology. In this hymnal com- position, the anthropomorphic and myth- ological ideas, and perhaps also the ap- pearance of the sun, are employed as met- aphors similarly as in the conception of God which is expressed in the prophetic literature of the Old Testament. On the other hand, the earthly king preserved his divine character as both Horus and the Son of Re in the theory of the government, which we have seen was genuinely one with the theology. How- ever, worldly works of literature reveal that as early as 2100 B.C. the king thought of himself as a mere human being and was looked on as such by the unlimited num- ber of readers, his subjects, notwithstand- ing the worship which was bestowed on him as a divine being in royal receptions and in hymns in accordance with the gov- ernmental and theological doctrine. There was one figure in the ancient con- 23 See ZAS, LXXXII (1957), 81. for the Maat boat and the Ennead (in my paper, "Die Sonnenboote in den Pyramidentexten: erste Folge"). 24 Translation and commentary by Eduard Meyer, Gottesstaat, Militarherrschaft und Stdndewesen in Ae- gypten (Berlin, 1928), pp. 11-20.

This was Osiris. Osiris, the deceased king, had been existent, on the one hand, in the earth as the ruler and judge of the necropolis; this will be dis- cussed below. On the other hand, he was, we have seen, the lord of heaven. But when Re was acknowledged as the lord of heaven, no space in heaven was left for Osiris. The struggle of the Osiris king, NN, to emerge from his tomb and either to be accepted by Re as his peer in heaven or to replace Re, is clearly evidenced in the Pyramid Texts. We are interpreting this struggle as a theological effort to re- affirm in the future the existence of the individual king being Osiris as the divine ruler in the light of heaven as contrasted with the darkness of the tomb and the netherworld. This struggle was in vain, and the concept of the god Osiris was sepa- rated from that of the deceased king. The latter was permitted to join Re when he traveled through the netherworld from west to east during the night, according to the pictures and inscriptions which were prevalent in the royal tombs of the New Kingdom. As to the god Osiris, the famous dialogue of Atum and Osiris, in the 175th chapter of the Book of the Dead according to Any,25 makes the final solution of the problem evident: when Osiris complained about his life alone in the darkness he was comforted by the words of Atum that only the two of them, Atum and Osiris, would survive in eternity when the world would have vanished. This idea of eternal exist- ence corresponds with the old concept that Atum and the king Horus-Osiris were the gods of the primeval beginning. At the same time, when Osiris struggled for his life in the light, another aspect of Osiris grew up. Osiris being the deceased king had been the ruler of the necropolis, the judge who punished tomb-robbers and would have prevented the admission to his "roads" of those deceased who were accused of a crime and not acknowledged as righteous by their contemporaries. This concept changed with the breakdown of the social order of the Old Kingdom, about 2300 B.C., from which the individual consciousness emerged. From then on it was no longer the acknowledgment of his contemporaries which proved the right- eousness of a man. He had then to fit into a divine order which was no longer mir- rored on earth. He had to answer to God for the deeds of his life after death. Thus the god Osiris, who was then no longer the deceased king, became the judge in a trial in the beyond, to which every man was subjected.26 I wish to make it very clear that what we have discussed here represents only a sector of Egyptian mythology. It is what we may call the core of the governmental theology as expressed in the mythological concepts concerning the unequaled and highest god. We have disregarded other concepts which also played a role in the theology of the third millennium, for in- stance, those of certain local deities such as Ptah, Min, and Neit, that of the king as a bull, that of the Lower Egyptian king. While they were more or less connected with the concept of the king Horus-Osiris, it appears that their influence was inci- 26 See Kees, Gotterglaube, p. 216. Translation in ANET, p. 9. 2 The shift of the role of Osiris has become gradu- ally evident. See relevant discussions, J NES, XIII, 24-26, 51. The idea that Pyr. 1556 a indicated the existence of a concept of a lawsuit between Osiris and Seth as early as in the Pyramid Texts, has been dis- proved by means of conclusive parallels in JNES, XVI, 182, n. 28, in my paper, "The Legal Aspect of the Instruction of Amenemhet." I may summarize my view as follows: No evidence exists for the con- cept of a lawsuit of Osiris and Seth in the Pyramid Texts. The reference to this lawsuit in the Coffin Texts can be easily explained as a recent concept which was based upon the idea that the defendant in the beyond, the deceased man, would become Osiris himself. He was already called "Osiris" in anticipa- tion of his redemption, and consequently his trial was applied to the god.</page><page sequence="15">EGYPTIAN THEOLOGY IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. 183 dental and not basic. By restricting our- selves to the concept of Horus and the mythological cycles of the pedigree of the gods and the story concerning the king Osiris, we have succeeded in gaining a foothold which may well turn out to be useful if we approach the adjacent prob- lems. This foothold is not by any means yet fixed and complete and will certainly be altered in details, as it has been also during the preparation of this paper for print. There is no question, however, that the elements which we have discussed here were those which molded the Egyp- tian religion and were more significant of it than any other features. May I end this study by pointing out some conclusions and problems of a more general character, which are based on the interpretation which I have presented here? (1) The concept of the universal god was, in Egypt, not primary or innate in the individual mind. It originated in a cer- tain situation of the society. We may think that the discovery of the eternal and universal god was due to an outstanding individual or to a few of them in conse- quence of an experience which they shared with their people. (2) This discovery was elaborated on with sound natural logic and a reasonable amount of speculation, but neither with so deep a religious insight that it would surpass our capability of mind nor with arbitrary fictitiousness. (3) Egyptian theology as discussed here was based on two factors, the faithful ac- knowledgment of the prehistoric con- cepts of the first living being and the ex- perience of the victory of the king who unified Egypt. We may say, therefore, in terms which may be called unscholarly, that the Egyptian religion was given by God by means of an unheard-of experi- ence, and humbly and devotedly molded by men. This appears similar to the origin of any other of the great western religions of which I know. (4) The two questions which the Egyp- tian sages answered with the lineage of Horus were, first, how we may understand the death of the god who has appeared as a human being and, second, how we may conceive the universal god. The fact that both these questions are as valid today as they were 5000 years ago appears rather significant. Obviously, it would be wrong to try to understand the development of religious ideas in those terms which we apply to technical and scientific progress. (5) The two great cycles of mythological tales in Egypt, that of the king Osiris and that of the creator Atum, originated in the concept of the pedigree of the gods, which appears to have developed in the context of a ritual. This is an interesting example of the origin of mythological concepts in sincere theological speculation, presum- ably in rites. We are not permitted, of course, to generalize on these examples.27 (6) Cursory examinations of later Egyptian mythological concepts as ex- pressed in pictures, hymns, or otherwise, have shown that our understanding of the early dynastic theology as a distinctive unit greatly helps to identify the factors, both prehistoric and historic, of which the intricate concepts are composed. We can understand how this intricacy came to pass if we realize that the Egyptian re- ligious mind was at the same time persist- ent and creative. It was always ready to put virtually each single concept into rela- tion to any other in a kaleidoscopic man- ner without any system, and led only by logical, verbal, and perhaps visual28 as- 27 In Section II, n and p, I have concluded that ap- parently a fictitious story was intentionally added to the tale of Osiris in order to amalgamate a heteroge- neous element with the latter. 28 The question to which degree, if any, visual im- pressions of works of art prompted the formation of mythological concepts in Egypt appears to be inter-</page><page sequence="16">184 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES sociations. By means of this procedure the number of their mythological concepts was rendered infinite and the insight into the mythical world, consequently, was thought to be intensified. The idea that a specific mythopoeic (or, for that matter, prelogical, or magical) mood of thinking created mythical concepts is, I think, not borne out in the studies of the historic period of Egypt. I may add that, in my opinion, modern ideas and catchwords like these obscure the fact that, in all of us, the conception of religious ideas is due to an activity of the human mind which is different from that which leads us to sci- entific achievements; see here Section II, o. (7) If the preceding sentence appears subjective and objectionable, I may as well add a speculation. Supposing that the discovery of the universal god around 3000 B.C. were not restricted to Egypt. Then we may consider it as a step in the development of mankind which took place in other areas as well and at about the same time. There is, I think, some reason to take this possibility into account.29 Frankly, I do not know whether Walde- mar Schmidt's thesis, that a spiritual con- cept of one highest god is existent in vir- tually all the so-called primitive religions, has ever been conclusively refuted."3 Per- haps there is a point in it. On the basis of the hypothesis which we are accepting for the purpose of this final paragraph we should conclude that, if the idea of a uni- versal god does exist in those religions, it would be a degenerate rather than primi- tive concept. The unsophisticated so- called primitives are perhaps not primi- tives at all in the history of religion. While this certainly is not a new idea, it may be useful to have it somewhat corroborated by Egyptian history. The mere possi- bility that the present theory is right must make us very cautious in applying the results of ethnological studies in the field of religion to the early Egyptians. II. REMARKS ON VARIOUS MYTHOLOGI- CAL CONCEPTS AS ATTESTED IN THE PYRAMID TEXTS PREFATORY NOTE The remarks which are gathered in this section were first intended to be footnotes based on previous random notes. They are, therefore, arranged in a progressive order which was prompted by the pro- ceedings of my discussion presented in Section I. Naturally, however, they soon outgrew the character of footnotes in both size and number because additional re- search became imperative. At no time, however, have I thought of these notes as exhaustive monographs. They are based solely on Sethe's edition of the Pyramid Texts, while J6quier's supplements to the version N (Pepy II), the texts of the pyramids of the three queens, etc., have been disregarded for technical reason. I think that little if any damage has been done by this restriction. Furthermore, since these notes were prepared to sub- stantiate the discussion in Section I, with the evidence of no texts later than the Pyramid Texts, I may often have disre- garded studies of others on those topics which I have discussed here. At the pres- ent stage of my research, it does not mat- ter whether some of the results of the esting. I do not know the answer but I have suggested, in the short discussion of the Divine Cow which is mentioned above, n. 4, that the addition of the divine guards of the four supports of the heavenly roof into the picture of the Divine Cow might have prompted the story that divine assistants were called up by Re to support the trembling legs of the Divine Cow. 29 Most pregnant religious movements came into existence independently in the first half of the last millennium n.c. in so wide an area as from Egypt to the Far East, i.e., virtually wherever we can trace his- tory back into that period. This has been a favorite idea of mine since I first pointed to it in Lebensregeln und Lebensweisheit (Leipzig, 1933), pp. 35 f. 30 See Waldemar Schmidt, "Die Gestalt des hbch- sten Wesens der Urkultur," in Historia Mundi, I (Bern, 1952), 474 ff.</page><page sequence="17">EGYPTIAN THEOLOGY IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. 185 present studies are new and whether they cover the complete evidence. The decisive question is, has the restriction to the ear- liest Egyptian sources permitted us to gain a firm foothold for future studies. The discussions presented in this section have made me confident that the answer to this question is affirmative. The following topics will be discussed: (a) The earthly and the heavenly Ho- rus. (b) Horus and his local varieties. (c) The wings which represent the sky in the picture of king Horus Serpent. (d) The universal god and "the unique one." (e) "The lord of heaven." (f) "The great god." (g) Horus-Osiris. (h) The great corporation of Helipolis; Hathor. (i) The pedigree of the gods. (j) The Ennead. (k) Isis and Nephthys. (1) The first three generations of the pedigree; Tefnut. (m) The drowning of Osiris and other possible allusions to cosmic ideas in the tale of Osiris and Horus. (n) The brothers Horus and Seth. The fights. (o) Definitions of some relevant expres- sions. Faith and reason in mythological concepts. (p) The tale of Osiris and Horus in the Pyramid Texts. (q) Geb. (r) Nefertem. (s) The name of Atum. (t) The character of Atum. (u) The primeval serpent, the primeval beetle, and their relations to the sun. (v) The assimilation of Atum to the king of Egypt. (a) THE EARTHLY AND THE HEAVENLY HORUS The concept of the earthly Horus is evi- dent in the fact that the denotation "Ho- rus" introduced the name of virtually every king31 since the beginning of the First Dynasty. The identity of the earthly Horus with the heavenly Horus appears to be attested in Pyr. 1258 a-b, where the deceased king is equated successively with HIr i3bty, "Horus of the East"; IHr nb pct, "Horus, the lord of men"; IHr dity, "Horus of the Dat-dawn(?)"; and Hr nb t3wy, "Horus, the lord of the two lands." The epithets nb pct and nb t6wy indicate the reign of Horus on earth, while, presum- ably, i2bty and dity indicate the rise of Horus out of the horizon just as the names IHr 3)ty, "Horus of the horizon," and IHr ssmty, "Horus of the eastern place Ssmt(?)." See Sethe's comments on Pyr. 362 b for Ifr dity and on 450 b-c for Hr ssmty. Similarly, the location of the heav- enly Horus appears somewhat restricted in the expressions Hr hry dMd pt (Pyr. 800 a, 1036 a) and IH r hry shdw pt (Pyr. 449 b), which we do not have to discuss here. No restriction to a section of the sky is expressed in the names HIr nb pt, "Ho- rus, the lord of the sky (or, of heaven)" (Pyr. 888 c) and Ifr nwly, "Horus of the Nwt-sky," "the heavenly Horus" (Pyr. 2037 a). The idea that Horus appears in the horizon and on heaven obviously means that he is a celestial body. He is 1 I am disregarding here the appearance of Seth in the names of Peribsen and Kha-sekhemuy, also the occurrence of two falcons in various names. See Hugo Miiller, Die formale Entwicklung der Titulatur der agyptischen KOnige (Glickstadt, 1938), pp. 25-28. S. Schott, "Zur Kr6nungstitulatur der Pyramiden- zeit," Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften in Gttingen I. Philosophisch-Historische Klasse, 1956, No. 4, p. 56 ff., has suggested that the word "Horus" in the name of the king in the early dynastic period is a syntactical element of the name rather than an iden- tification of the king as Horus. I have refuted this suggestion extensively in a "Miszelle" in ZiAS, Vol. LXXXVI, which is in press.</page><page sequence="18">186 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES evidently in some cases the sun, in other cases, a star. The identification of Horus with the sun is not attested in the early period, to my knowledge. However, I do not think that the equation of Re with Horus as Re-Harakhty, which is first attested un- der Niuser-Re in Abu Gurab, would have been possible if Horus was not the sun. I shall further discuss Re-Harakhty at the end of this paragraph a. fIr-Bhdty will be discussed below, in paragraph b. We have often thought that the earliest evidence of Horus being the sun was the carved pic- ture on the comb of king Horus Serpent of the First Dynasty (see below, paragraph c), in which the falcon in the boat repre- sents the celestial body. The boat does not indicate him with certainty as the sun, however, since the stars also may cross the heavenly waters by boat (Pyr. 802 b). "The heavenly Horus" is mentioned in the annals for year x + 8 of king Ny-ntr of the Second Dynasty, and "Horus who pre- sides over the sky" occurs in the name of a vineyard of king Djoser of the Third Dynasty. The note concerning king Ny- ntr32 reads ~ and was translated in Schdifer's publication by Sethe as "das erste Mal des Festes der Verehrung des Horus vom Himmel." However, long be- fore I wondered about the identity of Horus, I preferred to translate the phrase more verbally as "the first time of the sailing of the heavenly Horus, the star," and I added, "whatever this might mean." This translation has been corroborated by the fact that the writing of the word dw&amp; with the mere ideogram * is not attested before the Middle Kingdom, according to WB, V, 422-30, while dw3 written with phonograms occurs often in the Old King- dom. Therefore the reading of the star as Ab3, "star," must be preferred to dw3, "worship." What seems to be the only ex- ception to the aforementioned rule in the writing of dw3 confirms my reading. This is the writing of the names of the vine- yards * []z and "30t?- of kings Djoser and Kha-sekhemuy respectively (WB, V, 430). In these names a phonetic writing dw3 does not appear to be attested at any period. I think, therefore, that the names should be read bi3 HIr rnty pt and SbI HIr b3w and should be translated, "The star (is?) Horus who presides over the sky," and "The star (is?) Horus of the Bau-beings." We do not depend solely on this early evidence, however. The charac- ter of Horus as a star is also attested in the Pyramid Texts. In Pyr. 1508 c, Sothis is appealed to "in this your name of Horus who presides over the 3[iw-beings, the star which crosses the wud-wr-waters." "Horus Sothis" occurs in Pyr. 331 a T as a variant reading of "Horus Sopdu" (330 a W), and "Horus who is (imy) Sothis," in Pyr. 1636 b. j.r d^ty is a star (Pyr. 1207 a, 1301 a; see Sethe's comment on 362 b). For later evidence of the identification of Horus with a star, see Horus among other deities in the lists of the decans and Kees, Gotterglaube, p. 90, n. 5 (Hr hry w3_d.f). Beside the conclusion that Horus was the sun, and the evidence that he was a star, indications seem to exist that Horus was also the moon. Certain early dynastic representations of the Horus falcon stand- ing on a crescent shaped support have been interpreted as Horus standing upon the crescent. If this interpretation is right, it does not have to mean that Horus was the moon. This representation may indi- cate him as a star. However, similar pic- tures of Horus standing upon a curved line make its interpretation as the crescent 32 H. Schsifer, Ein Bruchstiick altdgyptischer Anna- len (Berlin, 1902), p. 24. The ideogram of a boat may as well denote the name of a boat and not the sailing. Compare also * W following the name of king Wng (J. P.

The opinion that Horus likewise could be identified with Thoth meaning the moon may be de- fended by the fact that, according to the Pyramid Texts, Horus and Thoth appear to supplement each other, either together with Seth or similarly as Horus and Seth (e.g., Pyr. 535, 1612-13; 956 b, 1429 d, 1507; cf. Kees, Gatterglaube, p. 491, addi- tion to p. 259). Finally, later texts assure a close connection between Osiris and the moon (Bonnet, Reallexikon, pp. 471 ff.). If we can trace this back to the identifica- tion of the deceased king as both Osiris and Horus in the Pyramid Texts (see be- low, paragraph g), it may also indicate that Horus was the moon. All these argu- ments for Horus being the moon appear more or less farfetched. The mythological concept of the Eye of Horus has been ex- plained as a cosmic concept based on the phases of the moon, and it was connected with them in later Egyptian texts; see Bonnet, Reallexikon, s. v. "Mondauge," "Mond." If this connection was genuine, it contradicted any identification of Horus himself with the moon, but we must leave open the question of whether it was genu- ine (see below, the end of paragraph n). In conclusion, we may think of the identifica- tion of Horus with the moon as possible but by no means as well attested as that with both the sun and a star. Thus the heavenly Horus was neither exclusively the sun nor a star. He was the sun as well as a star and, perhaps, also the moon. As the ruler of the sky and of heaven he appears to have been repre- sented by a conspicuous celestial body which dominated the sky, that is, the sun in the daytime and whichever star was brightest in the night-time, and this latter might have been replaced by the moon when it was visible. However, while Horus was not solely the sun, the visible sun in the sky was always Horus. The fact that the celestial Horus vir- tually never became invisible according to this interpretation makes the difference between him and Re conspicuous, since the latter vanished in the evening. The fact that Horus, to my knowledge, has hardly ever been looked on as a creator god, although this quality seems to be characteristic of the sun in ancient Egypt, can also be easily understood now. It ap- pears, therefore, that the heavenly Horus originated as the product of theological speculation, presumably as the heavenly counterpart of the earthly king Horus, and that he was neither a genuine cosmic concept nor, particularly, the sun. With this understanding of Horus in mind, I should like to elaborate on what I said earlier in this paragraph about Re- Harakhty. I think I was right in saying that this composite concept was not pos- sible if Harakhty was not genuinely the sun. We have some reason, however, to assume that Harakhty was not merely the sun. On the one hand, Re and Harakhty 33 See E. Baumgartel, The Culture of Prehistoric Egypt (2d ed.; London, 1955), p. 47, with reference to W. F. Petrie, Prehistoric Egypt (London, 1920), p. 49. The crescent might appear quite convincing in J. E. Quibell, Hierakonpolis I (London, 1900), Pls. 19.1; 20.1. But P1. 26c.5 shows the same "crescent" as the terminal platform to which a standard shaft is at- tached and which serves as the support for a falcon. I am not ready to decide whether this crescent-shaped platform belongs to the Horus falcon or to the stand- ard shaft. If, however, we understand this "crescent" on the standard as a mere technical support for the falcon, we may then explain its concave shape as a particularity which also appears in the similarly curved line of the Arb-sign upon which the falcon stands in W. F. Petrie, Royal Tombs II (London, 1901), P1. 2. This definitely is not the crescent and, according to Petrie, loc. cit., Pl. 14.97-99, it does not seem to have any meaning. I certainly agree with Mrs. Baumgartel that all these concave lines are not boats but I am not ready to accept her interpretation of them as crescents. However, I have not yet read her discussion of this question in the second volume of her book, which is in press.</page><page sequence="20">188 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES apparently are distinguished from each other in Pyr. 337 b and parallel texts (see Sethe's comments). On the other hand, the identification of Hr dity as a star, which I have mentioned above, suggests that the name HIr 3Ety might have been applied to a star as well. We may, there- fore, conclude that perhaps "Harakhty" was one of the names of the lord of heav- en, whether he appeared as a star or as the sun, and that only the composite name of Re-Harakhty determined his character as exclusively the sun. This conclusion is de- batable, however. Perhaps the names 3~ty (Pyr. 346 b and parallels as mentioned in Sethe's commentary; 1085 a), Ssmty (Pyr. 342 c), and D:ty (Pyr. 362 b) denoted the sun or a star respectively, and Horus was then equated with them as IHr 3)ty, Hr Ssmty, and Hir D3ty. It seems necessary to mention that this understanding of Horus represents the latest result of the present paper. On the one hand, it manifestly corroborates the understanding of the origin of the concept of the universal god, Horus, as presented in this paper. On the other hand, as the paper was not composed on the basis of the results of this paragraph, I could make only small alterations in the text to make it fit with what I think is the correct un- derstanding of the heavenly Horus. (b) HORUS AND HIS LOCAL VARIETIES The interpretation of Horus as a trinity consisting of the falcon, the earthly king, and the ruler of heaven, is reminiscent of the trinity of Re, Aton, and the king, which is found in the tomb inscriptions of Amarna; see my pamphlet, Die Maat des Echnaton von Amarna (Baltimore, 1952), p. 6 and, for the relation of Amarna to Heliopolis, which might suggest an inter- dependence of these concepts, ibid., pp. 30, 32. Furthermore, the interpretation of Horus as a trinity facilitates a classifica- tion of the local varieties of Horus which are attested in the Pyramid Texts and earlier, for instance, the Horuses of Nkn, Hm, Dbcwt, Bhdt, and those of Libya and other countries. One or another of them might well have been primarily the falcon and secondarily assimilated to any of the three aspects of Horus; in other cases, Horus might have been imposed upon the local deity. We may add a few remarks on Hr Bhdty which are relevant to the discussion in paragraph c. IJr Bhdty has been compre- hensively discussed by Gardiner, "Horus the Behdetite," JEA, XXX (1944), 23 ff.; I may refer to this paper for the references to the items which will be mentioned here. According to Gardiner, loc. cit., p. 49, the name Behdety was, "not unlikely... at first confined to the hovering falcon, and only secondarily borrowed thence to be applied to the Winged Disk"; the winged sun-disk, however, "represented the king's actual person," since it is called "the good god, the lord of the two lands" in a Sinai inscription of Niuser-Re. I think that this interpretation explains the evi- dence as satisfactorily as possible. The hovering falcon Behdety was, then, as a variant of the standing falcon, identical with Horus as early as the Third Dynasty, when the name Bhdty Hir (and not, Ijr bhdty) appeared in the inscription of one of the Djoser panels, while the name Bhdty was first added to the hovering falcon in Hatnub under Khufu. In any event, the concept of the hovering falcon is obviously different from that of the winged sun- disk. As for the latter, I may add here a few remarks. First, if the winged sun-disk was a symbol of the king and of the king- ship of the two lands of Egypt, we do not have any reason to assume that this sun- disk meant the deity Re. Second, we can- not tell whether these wings were genu- inely those of a falcon or of a bettle (see</page><page sequence="21">EGYPTIAN THEOLOGY IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. 189 below, paragraph u). Third, the winged sun-disk certainly did not represent the sky. In the Sahure-relief he is called "the great god, with variegated feathers," and perhaps "Behdety" and he is pictured to- gether with the hovering falcon beneath the sky, which is indicated by the stars. (C) THE WINGS WHICH REPRESENT THE SKY IN THE PICTURE OF KING HORUS SERPENT34 At the beginning of this discussion, I may point out that nobody can be certain, on the basis of our present knowledge, to what kind of bird these wings belong. The picture is unique and we do not know any- thing about its actual context. Still, I think that this topic is worth discussing. There is no question that Schifer was cor- rect in interpreting these wings as the sky because they are supported by the dcm- supports, and the boat of Horus sails upon them. Since then, the opinion that these wings were those of the Horus falcon had generally been accepted, with the excep- tion of S. Schott, Mythe und Mythen- bildung (Leipzig, 1945), p. 75, who ex- plained them as those of the (female) vul- ture of El Kab. Although Gardiner, JEA, XXX, 49 (see above, paragraph b), inter- preted them as a prototype of the winged sun-disk, he thought that "both" the fal- cons which are depicted on the comb "must surely be the falcon to which the wings belong." On the contrary, I think that Gardiner's understanding of both the winged sun-disk and the hovering Beh- dety-falcon, and also the results of our discussion of Horus above in paragraph a, render very improbable the opinion that the wings were those of Horus. In this context I have mentioned, in Section I of this paper, that one of the lesser objections to the interpretation of the wings as those of a falcon is the fact that the sky was thought of, in Egypt, usually as a female. The concept of the female sky and the male earth appears characteristic of Egypt, where the Nile, and not the rain, provides for the fertile moisture. It may be regarded as indicative of this situation that the word kbhw, which is masculine and often used for the sky in the Pyramid Texts, is exceptional since it indicates heaven as the body of water upon which Re sails, and the same holds good for the word bi3, "the sky," which occurs since the Middle Kingdom. In contrast to what appears to be the basi- cally feminine character of the sky, the falcon Horus is a male and, according to WB, VI, 54, s. v. "Flilgel," the old words for "wing" are also masculine. Other ob- jections to the usual interpretation of the wings on the comb were mentioned in MDAIK, XV, 4, namely, the identifica- tion of Re with Horus and the fact that, in the lineage of Horus, Nut represents the sky. Furthermore, neither Hr nb pt (Pyr. 888 c) nor Hr nty pt (see above, para- graph b) seems to fit into an equation of Horus with the sky because these names indicate him as the lord of the sky. Junker, Giza II (Wien, 1934), 48, lists only Ptole- maic temple inscriptions as evidence of an equation of the wings of Horus with the sky, and this late evidence must be dis- regarded here. All of these objections, however, might previously have been refuted with the fol- lowing argument: since the Egyptians re- garded the sun as a falcon flying in heav- en, the idea that his wings represented the sky was incidental and naturally accepted in spite of any logical objections. How- ever, on the basis of the discussion above, in paragraph a, the very presumption 34 W. F. Petrie, Tombs of the Courtiers (London, 1925), Pls. 2, 12, and p. 4.6. Thoroughly discussed by H.

Engelbach, "An Alleged Winged Sun-Disk of the First Dynasty," ZAS, LXV (1930), 115 f. and PI. 8. Often reproduced elsewhere.</page><page sequence="22">190 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES that, in the early period, Horus was ever conceived of as a falcon flying in the sky, is no longer well founded. Indeed, Horus in his character as both the image of a falcon and as the ruler on earth, is adequately represented by the standing falcon. It was this concept which I think was transferred onto the sky and, consequently, he is represented on the comb of king Serpent standing as the heavenly ruler in the boat, as the celestial body. If, in the early dynastic period, a falcon was ever thought to represent the sky, this might have been possible, to our knowledge, solely on the basis of the con- cept of the hovering Behdety, and not on that of the standing falcon representing the heavenly Horus. The question whether or not this was possible, must be left open for the time being. As for the idea that the winged sun- disk is alluded to by the wings on the comb of king Serpent, we may argue as follows: If, on the one hand, the winged disk was a symbol, as we have assumed with Gardiner, it could hardly be pictured without the disk, notwithstanding the fact that it was depicted with the wings re- placed by the two uraei as early as the Fifth Dynasty. If, on the other hand, Ho- rus on the boat replaced the sun-disk on the comb, then the winged sun-disk was not a symbolic figure which represented the earthly king. Furthermore, while the wings in the picture on the comb ob- viously represented the sky, the winged sun-disk evidently did not; see above, the end of paragraph b. Nor do we have, for that matter, any evidence that the sun- beetle represented the sky; cf. below, paragraph u. In MDAIK, XV, 4 and 7, I have sug- gested that the wings might have been those of a vulture, incidentally in accord- ance with Schott's interpretation which I have mentioned above. I now prefer to offer my arguments for this possibility in a slightly different manner. There exists good indication that the sky represented a vulture to the early Egyptians. The phrase, "Nut has fallen upon her son" (Pyr. 1629 a; similarly, e.g., 825 a) can be understood, I think, solely on the basis of the phrase "the vulture has fallen upon her son" (Pyr. 1611 b), since the custom of protecting her young with her wings is characteristic of the Egyptian vulture.35 In Pyr. 1370 b, "they placed him into her wings," "her" refers to the heavenly 8mit- cow which we know was identified with a vulture (see Sethe's comments on Pyr. 388 c and 729 a-b). Thus the equation of Nut with a vulture appears quite plausible and that of the Sm3t-cow with a vulture appears certain. Although, according to Bonnet, Reallexikon, p. 404, the fm3t-cow is not attested as representing the sky it- self, the opinion that she did so cannot be disproved either and appears acceptable. See further MDAIK, XV, 6 f. for the identification of the sky with a cow. I think that the argument for the sky being alternatively Nut, the -mit-cow, and a vulture, has proved to be rather good. In conclusion I should say that the only alternative to the interpretation of the wings on the comb of king Serpent is that they are either those of Behdety or those of the vulture. I for one prefer the latter as long as we do not know more about the subject. I think that, just as the concept of the 'mit-vulture was suited to appear be- side that of Nut in the Pyramid Texts, so her wings stood for Nut in the representa- tive picture of king Horus Serpent. a3 This attitude of the griffon vulture, gyps fulvus, G 14 in Gardiner's sign-list, appears striking and char- acteristic of this bird even to the present day. See L. A. Tregenza, Egyptian Years (London, 1958), p. 89, the description of the observation of a griffon as given by an Arab in the eastern desert: ". . . there was one young bird only. The parent vulture half stood and half sat over it from behind. Its great wings were open to keep the sun away from the young one."</page><page sequence="23">EGYPTIAN THEOLOGY IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. 191 (d) THE UNIVERSAL GOD AND "THE UNIQUE ONE" The concept of the universal god is ex- pressed in the terms nb tm, "the lord of the universe" (Pyr. 305 a), and n(n) dr.f, "the unlimited one" (Pyr. 1434 b, 1442 b). It obviously does not exclude the concepts of other gods and must not be confused with monotheism. According to the definition that the universal god is the ruler of all and worshiped by men (see MDAIK, XV, 2), he is the king of the gods. He is con- ceived of as their creator in the so-called Memphite Theology, 11. 58-61.36 Accord- ingly, Horus is called Hr rpct nsw ntrw, "Horus, the prince, the king of the gods" (Pyr. 1458 e), while Ifr ntrw (e.g., Pyr. 999 c, 1086 a, 1412 a), according to Sethe's comment on Pyr. 525 a-b, might only mean that Horus belongs to the gods and then should be read Hr ntrwy. The expressions WC, "the One," as which the deceased king, NN, appears in the Pyramid Texts (e.g., 254 a, c, 293 b, 853 a, 1078 e) and nb WC, "the one lord" (Pyr. 276 c) must, as I think, be inter- preted as "the unequaled one" rather than "the only one"; cf. WC ny ht, "the One (i.e. the unequaled one) who belongs to the corporation" (Pyr. 1041 a, see JNES, XIII, 38). Apparently, the meaning of WC is not different from that of wcty in this context. Sb) wcty is "the unique star" among the other stars (Pyr. 251 b, 1048 b; cf. too 877 c). Thus, t8.f wcty is "his special bread" (Pyr. 1226 c) and ntr c3 wcty, "the unequaled great god" (Pyr. 1616 c). This is no news and corresponds with Mas- pero's findings concerning ntr wC in Bib- liotheque egyptologique, II (Paris, 1893), 185 f. (e) "THE LORD OF HEAVEN" (nb pt) This epithet denotes Horus (Pyr. 888 c), the deceased king, NN, in his character as both Harakhty and "the great god" (Pyr. 7 b M) and Osiris (Pyr. 964= 967= 968 a, only in P). It may appear strange that Re is apparently not called the lord of heaven. May we assume, therefore, that the old idea that the heavenly Horus was visible at day and night (above, para- graph a) still prevented the name "lord of heaven" from being applied to Re in the Pyramid Texts? Anyway, the claim of Osiris to be the lord of heaven appears also strange because it contradicts the tenor of the Pyramid Texts, according to which Osiris struggled for his seat in heav- en on the place of, or with, Re. Perhaps it was the offensive character of the de- nomination of Osiris as the lord of heaven which prompted M and N to replace nb pt with the colorless nb(.i), nb.f, "my (or his) lord," in Pyr. 964 ff. Sethe's contra- dictory interpretation of this change of wording (Kommentar, IV, 245, 252 f.) fails to make understandable why as late as the Sixth Dynasty P should have initiated a strangely new aspect of Osiris as "the lord of heaven." Whether or not P was mistaken, his idea that Osiris was the lord of heaven was, I think, obsolete and not new. (f) "THE GREAT GOD" The following equations of the great god, ntr c3, in the Pyramid Texts are, I hope, correct in general although one or another might be debated. The great god is Osiris in 2000 b (as compared with 2095); NN, the deceased king, in 7 b; Horus, the son of Osiris, in 465 b (cf. too 70 c); Geb in 1616 c (see below, para- graph q). Mostly, however, the great god is Re, namely, in Pyr. 274 c, 760 c, 816 d, 1471 c, 2095 a, and probably so in 276 c ("with unknown name"), 1180 d, 1182 a, 1190 a, 1191 a, 1208 b, and 1984 c. Outside of the Pyramid Texts, the great god of the tomb inscriptions of the Old Kingdom has been identified as Re by Breasted, as 36 H. Junker, Die Goitterlehre von Memphis (Berlin, 1940). Translation: ANET, pp. 4-6.</page><page sequence="24">192 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Osiris or the deceased king by Gardiner and Sethe, as the king by Kees, as pri- marily Horus by Junker. See A. H. Gardi- ner and K. Sethe, Egyptian Letters to the Dead (London, 1928), pp. 11 f., and H. Junker, Giza II (Wien, 1934), 52. All these opinions are well founded and fit also in the evidence of the Pyramid Texts. Ac- cording to my present view of the develop- ment of concepts, ntr C~ was first the king in both his aspects of the living Horus and the deceased Osiris, and from about the beginning of the Fifth Dynasty, this ex- pression was also applied to Re. The discussion of the problem of "the two great gods" in the Pyramid Texts must be postponed for the time being. I wonder if Sethe was right in dealing with this dual concept without taking the sin- gular concept into consideration, in his comment on Pyr. 952 b. However, it must be conceded that something strange is in- volved in the dual concept, which I am not ready to understand. (g) HORUS-OSIRIS The deceased king, according to the Pyramid Texts, is sometimes Osiris (e.g., Pyr. 793 b, 872 c, 1337 a) and sometimes Horus (e.g., 436 a, 681 b, 1331 a); cf. "Horus who is (imy) Osiris NN" (Pyr. 831). Therefore the deceased king is the brother of Isis and Nephthys (e.g., Pyr. 577 a, 1630 a) and the son of the same goddesses (e.g., 371 c/379 c, 1375 a). My statement in JAOS, LXXIV, 39, that this split apparently did not affect the unity of the conception of divine kingship, and that the king's appearance as both Horus and Osiris played a role in his transfiguration, was based solely on my paper concerning m3c-hrw in JNES, Vol. XIII. The opinion that the transfiguration of the deceased king was closely connected with his char- acter as Horus has since been well cor- roborated, for instance, in Pyr. 1785 ac- cording to my discussion in ZAIS, LXXXII (1958), 87, in "Die Sonnenboote in den Pyramidentexten: erste Folge." To the best of my understanding, the trans- figuration of the deceased king into the heavenly god was accomplished by a mythical reiteration of the transformation of the crown prince into the god Horus. See the following paragraph, h. (h) THE GREAT CORPORATION OF HELIOPOLIS; HATHOR "The great corporation which was born in the beginning in Heliopolis" (Pyr. 1041 a) was tentatively identified with "that first corporation of idrwt (and) of the acclamation being 'right' " (Pyr. 1462 d) in JNES, XIII, 39-41, and this identifi- cation was made still more plausible, ibid., pp. 191-92. I have interpreted it with good reason, though not conclusively, as an earthly judicial body of the early dy- nastic period, which was thought to have originated in the primeval time and was reiterated in the mythical world. W. Helck, in ZAS, LXXXII (1958), 113, has re- jected this conclusion, I think, too easily. Unwittingly, however, he has corrobo- rated my opinion that the corporation was an institution of the earliest historical pe- riod. He has taken for granted that this corporation together with the presiding judge, Geb, practiced their office in ht .rw, "the house of the 8r-officials," in Heliopolis or, as he expresses it, this house or hall in the temple was given "die Rolle als Gerichtssaal des Geb als Richter und der Neunheit bezw. der K6rperschaft." Sethe also, in his comment on Pyr. 1041 a, has assumed that the corporation of He- liopolis was the same as the corporation of the Ennead (Pyr. 1689 a). I do not see any objection to this equation of the Ennead (see below, paragraph j) with the corpora- tion of Heliopolis and, by the same token, the equation of the ht Srw with the meet-</page><page sequence="25">EGYPTIAN THEOLOGY IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. 193 ing place of the corporation, and I think we may accept it. Then, a variant name of the ht trw, "the house of the 'r-officials," was ht HIr, "the house of Horus." This is made certain by the facts, on the one hand, that "the acclamation being 'right' " with Geb presiding took place in the heavenly house of Horus (Pyr. 1327 b-c; cf. 1025-27, 1278, 546), and, on the other hand, that the corporation of He- liopolis was "that first corporation of idrwt (and) of the acclamation being 'right' " (Pyr. 1462 d). This means that, in the mythical world of the Pyramid Texts, the corporation of Heliopolis ac- claimed the king as the right one in the house of Horus; see the detailed discussion of this concept in JNES, XIII, 41 ff., 191 f. The house of Horus, ht Hr, however, was early deified as "Hathor." This iden- tity of the house with the goddess was sug- gested on the basis of the Pyramid Texts in JNES, XIII, 49, n. 190, though only tentatively because I then thought that it was a strikingly new idea, which it was not. Meanwhile, the obviousness of this equation has transpired, and I found it also simultaneously, if my memory does not deceive me, somewhere in A. Piankoff, The Shrines of Tut-Ankh-Amun (New York, 1954). I may add that Bonnet, Reallexikon, p. 277, is wrong in assuming that "Hathor" and "the house of Horus" were written in a different orthography in the Pyramid Texts (see Pyr. 1278 b and 1327 b), and I may point out that NN was "the son of the House of Horus" (Pyr. 466 a) in exactly the same meaning as the Ennead "had borne him" (Pyr. 258 b). Then, since the House of Horus is identi- cal with Hathor, we must assume that it was conceived in, or presumably earlier than, the reign of Mycerinus, in which the goddess was first represented in stone, to the best of my knowledge. In the first third of the third millennium, however, Horus being the king of Egypt was a most actual living entity and, consequently, the house of Horus was an actual house or hall of the actual Horus. Perhaps the name "house of Horus" was applied to the house of the 'r-officials in the context of the nomination of the king, similarly as, ac- cording to my earlier discussions, the name "the d:d:t-council of the god" (Pyr. 309-313 f) was given the Corporation on the same occasion. Thus "the house of Horus" appears to have been an excep- tional and holy name of the house of the sr-officials. I think that the only possible alterna- tive for this explanation is the erroneous assumption that the heavenly "house of Horus" was first a fictional idea which had originated in the brain of someone in what then would have been a Heliopolitan de- partment of the studies of the geography of heaven, and that it was subsequently duplicated on earth, in Heliopolis. I wish to raise a very serious objection to this idea. I wonder if there is any case attested in early ancient Egypt in which a heav- enly entity was first conceived of in specu- lation and subsequently reiterated on earth. My studies on the sun boats have clearly shown that the earthly Maat-boat was reiterated in heaven, and I am afraid that a similar result will transpire con- cerning the Mesektet-Mandjet-boat. Most indicative of this situation is our present understanding of Horus (above, para- graph a), who was at first the falcon and the earthly king, while his aspect as the heavenly ruler was speculatively added. My present opinion that, except for the strictly cosmic concepts like sun and heav- en, the earthly entities existed, as a rule, before their heavenly counterparts dou- bled them, may be regarded as premature. Still, we should never take for granted that, for instance, heavenly localities were first invented and then duplicated on</page><page sequence="26">194 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES earth. One goal of the present paper is to make it clear that we, the Egyptologists, should no longer regard mythological con- cepts as fictional tales and ideas resulting from more or less baseless speculations. The assumption that a certain concept originated as the stroke of genius of a ruling priest, or something like that, will more often than not turn out to be wrong. For a relevant discussion, see also below, paragraph o. (i) THE PEDIGREE OF THE GODS The discussions of the pedigree of the gods have been interwoven with those of the Ennead since 1856, according to H. Brugsch, Thesaurus inscriptionum aegyptiacarum, IV, Mythologische In- schriften (Leipzig, 1884), 708. The final establishment of the pedigree as pictured here in Fig. 1, simultaneous with its iden- tification as the Ennead, was accom- plished, I think, by G. Maspero in his paper "Sur l'Enneade" as published in Bibliothvque 4gyptologique, II (Paris, 1893), 337-93. I do not know whether it has ever been doubted since. In any event, it is certainly worthwhile to examine the pedigree separately in this paragraph, and the Ennead in the succeeding paragraph j. As we are interested here in the third millennium, the later texts may be dealt with in a summarized form. I do not know if the complete pedigree is explicitly indi- cated as such in any Egyptian text. The names of its members are listed in a se- quence which in general corresponds with the pedigree, with each male preceding his spouse, in the lists of the members of the Ennead according to Brugsch (see the ref- erence below in paragraph j), though as a rule with additions and omissions. The Turin Papyrus also lists them as the dy- nasty of the gods, with the male exclu- sively, in the correct sequence, and with additions at the beginning and at the end (No. 6 in Brugsch's list). In the Pyramid Texts, the pedigree can be reconstructed on the evidence of scat- tered individual statements, for each of which I am listing only one random quota- tion. There are named, in accordance with the pedigree, the fathers of Shu, Tefnut, Geb, Nut, Osiris, Seth, and Horus (e.g., Pyr. 1870, 1248, 1615, 784, 170, 144, and 465) and the mothers of Nut, Osiris (often: Osiris NN), Horus (e.g., Pyr. 5, 171, and 734) and perhaps Seth (Pyr. 823, 1145). Furthermore, Seth, Isis, and Nephthys are called the brother and the sisters of Osiris (e.g., Pyr. 1500, 1280), and Seth is called the brother of Horus (Pyr. 1742; see below, paragraph n). I have not found evidence of Isis and Nephthys being called the children of either Geb or Nut. Every student of the Pyramid Texts, how- ever, is aware of the fact that almost every one of the deities who are listed here is, or may be, called the son or the daughter of another deity elsewhere in the Pyramid Texts, in apparent contradiction to the pedigree. Therefore this list is not fully conclusive. Further corroboration of the existence of the pedigree, though not conclusive either, may be found in those lists in the Pyramid Texts which contain the names of the deities which belong to it. The list, Pyr. 167-76, can be interpreted as evi- dence of the pedigree with two presump- tions, namely, that s3 "son" in Pyr. 167-71 must be translated as "great-grandson," "grandson," and "son" respectively, and that Thoth(Pyr. 175) was inserted only to replace Osiris and by this make the num- ber of the gods complete. Both these as- sumptions are arbitrary, however. We may well argue against them as follows: first, two mothers of NN are named simul- taneously in Pyr. 741 a, b, 1703 a, c, and</page><page sequence="27">EGYPTIAN THEOLOGY IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. 195 2052 b-2053 a, and, therefore, the naming of three fathers and two mothers of NN in Pyr. 167-71 appears quite acceptable; and, second, Thoth is the brother of Seth and Osiris in his own right, in deviation from our construction of the pedigree (Pyr. 163 d). Furthermore, there exists the enumeration of the nine gods in Pyr. 1521 a-b. This proves only that Atum is the single one, while the others are grouped by pairs in the same sequence as in the pedi- gree; Nephthys is replaced for one reason or another by Neit, and the arrangement of the list does not indicate by any means that the groups were looked upon as suc- cessive generations. Nor does there exist any indication of generations in the simi- lar grouping of names, Pyr. 1546-48, among which those of the second half of the pedigree are virtually missing and are replaced by other groups. The enumera- tion in Pyr. 1660-71 is correct from Atum to Nut, while the fourth and fifth genera- tions of the "pedigree" consist of two Osirises, Seth, and Horus, followed by other deities. In Pyr. 1655, all nine mem- bers of the first to fourth generations are enumerated in the right order. They are invoked as a distinctive group of deities called the Great Ennead (see below, paragraph j). Furthermore, they are called mS(w) Itm, "the children of Atum."37 Since Atum himself is numbered among these "children of Atum," and we are not permitted to interpret mSw Itm as "Atum with his family," we must con- clude that the group as a unit in its char- acter as the Ennead is called the children of Atum, and it is only incidentally that this group here includes Atum himself; see below, paragraph t, for the character of Atum as a father. Therefore this text does not supply evidence for the concept of the pedigree either. This rigid, though I think correct, criti- cism of the lists of names is a warning not to take the existence of the pedigree of the gods according to the Pyramid Texts too much for granted. Still, both the inter- relation of the members of the first three generations, who represent a rather un- changeable unit in the enumerations, and the interrelation of the members of the fourth and fifth generations, according to the tale of Osiris and Horus, are, we have seen, well corroborated by the statements concerning the individual characters; the family Geb, Nut, and Osiris is one of the best attested genealogical concepts of the Pyramid Texts; and the names of the deities who belong to the pedigree are manifestly prevalent in the name lists of the gods. These four factors combined rep- resent, I believe, satisfactory proof that those who prepared the Pyramid Texts were familiar with the concept of the pedi- gree. However, the variety of concepts concerning both the whole group and the individual interrelations of its members plainly show that the pedigree was not a fixed dogma from which any deviation would have been regarded as either faulty or heretical. The pedigree of the gods was neither the only accepted cosmogony, nor were its individual members strictly and exclusively bound in it. It represented only one of the aspects of the cosmogony, of the interrelation of the deities con- cerned, and of most if not all the individ- uals concerned. While we have always taken this fact into account, we have, I think, thought of it as a fault and an in- consistency of the Egyptian power of thinking. On the contrary, we should ac- cept the fact that the lack of dogmatic consistency which our examination has re- 3 The plural, mew, is attested in the N. K. copy, the daily temple ritual. See A. M. Calverley, The Temple of King Sethos I at Abydos, Vol. II (London, 1935), Pl. 19, lower register right, the speech of the king to Atum, 1. 9.</page><page sequence="28">196 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES vealed is the very character of the pedi- gree and other concepts. (j) THE ENNEAD The deities who belong to the pedigree, with the exception of Horus, are called "the great Ennead" as early as the Pyra- mid Texts (Pyr. 1655; see above, para- graph i). For the later periods, H. Brugsch, Thesaurus inscriptionum aegyptiacarum (Leipzig, 1883-84), pp. 724-30, quotes thirty-nine enumerations of the members of the Ennead. One of them, No. 11, is the duplicate of Pyr. 1655 which is quoted below in note 37, but none of the other thirty-eight lists contains the same nine gods completely and exclusively. With re- gard to Pyr. 1655, we have seen above that the indication of these particular nine gods as the Ennead was incidental. In my opinion, the equation of the deities of the pedigree with the Ennead was not genu- ine. Nevertheless, it was by its very na- ture genuinely suggested in the earliest period since both entities were regarded as having originated in the primeval times and having been indispensable for the ex- istence of Horus. See Z AS, LXXXII, 3, for the primeval origin of the deities of the pedigree and of the corporation of He- liopolis (Pyr. 1041 a and 1462 d-1463), and see above, paragraph h, for the plau- sible equation of the corporation with the Ennead; cf. also the primeval existence of the Ennead in a different context accord- ing to Pyr. 483 b. The following facts corroborate our conclusion that the equation of the nine gods of the first to fourth generations with the Ennead, in Pyr. 1655, was incidental since they show that the members of the pedigree were distinguished from the En- nead in many cases. An invocation in which the ten gods who belong to the pedi- gree are named one after the other is con- tinued with the names "the great En- nead," "the little Ennead," and "Nut" (? the antisky Naunet or the niwt-town, according to Sethe) in Pyr. 167-78. Noth- ing in this text suggests that "the great Ennead" is the summarization of the ten preceding names. Nor does the invocation of the great Ennead in Pyr. 1660 a prove that it consists of the twelve deities who are referred to subsequently in Pyr. 1660 c-1671. Neither Osiris nor Seth belong to the Ennead according to, e.g., Pyr. 1699 and 1628, in which latter text also Geb seems to be looked at as being outside the Ennead as is Horus. The Great Ennead trembles before Osiris NN (Pyr. 1012; cf. 1710). The two Enneads are seated next to either Geb (Pyr. 1045, 1204) or Atum (Pyr. 1982). Furthermore, the Memphite Theology, 11. 55-56, clearly distinguishes between the Ennead and the pair, Shu and Tefnut, according to the following sen- tence, which reads, translated verbally and without bias: "The Ennead of Atum came into existence as his sperms and as his fingers (hprn is p'dt Itm m mtwt f m dbcw.f). And the Ennead is the teeth and lips in this mouth which gave name to every thing and out of which Shu and Tefnut came, to whom the Ennead gave birth (or the children of the Ennead; prn Sw Tfnwt im.f mon podt)."38 In whatever 38 See above, n. 36, for references. In the first of those phrases which I have transliterated above, hipr m may be translated, according to WB, III, 261, either "entstehen aus .. ." or "werden zu. .. ." Of course, nobody will understand this to indicate that the Egyp- tian expression Apr m had two contradictory meanings. I have accepted for a long time that the basic meaning of the preposition m, "in," points to identification rather than to content because this meaning has helped me best to understand difficult expressions. Thus, Apr m indicates the essential identity of that which comes into existence with that from which it originated. In the second phrase, Junker has translated "sie (scil. Shu and Tefnut) gebaren die Gbtterneunheit," after Erman and supported by Sethe's grammatical interpretation (K. Sethe, Dramatische Teate zu altd- gyptischen Mysterienspielen [Leipzig, 1928], p. 59). Even according to this translation, however, neither Atum, Shu, nor Tefnut, belonged to the Ennead. Sethe like Breasted connected min pidt with the suc-</page><page sequence="29">EGYPTIAN THEOLOGY IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. 197 way the complex procedure might be un- derstood, the text certainly expresses the opinion that the Ennead was existent be- fore Shu and Tefnut were born. I have here tried to show that we must not assume that the name "the Ennead," "the nine gods," originally denoted the nine members of the first to fourth genera- tions of the pedigree of the gods. Indeed, if we assume that the Ennead was a cor- poration of nine anonymous members which was headed by, for instance, Geb, Atum, or Re, and that the equation with the members of the pedigree was inciden- tal, though suggested by similarities, the texts become much clearer. Having freed ourselves from the pre- sumption that "the Nine Gods" could have been no other than those nine who represented the lineage of Horus, we must ask ourselves what else the Ennead was. We have discussed the identity of the En- nead with the great corporation of He- liopolis above in paragraph h, where the relevant references have been quoted. Al- though I cannot yet commit myself to this identification, which has been ac- cepted by others and was also suggested by myself, I think that it is quite possible. Just like the corporation of Heliopolis, the Ennead is called ht, "body," "corpora- tion" (Pyr. 1250 e, 1689 a) and is a juridi- cal corporation (e.g., Pyr. 2, 1405, 1645 b); and the duality which is recognizable in the denotation of "the two Enneads" is also involved in the corporation of He- liopolis (Pyr. 1462 c-d; see JNES, XIII, 47, n. 168). It appears probable that the Corporation of Heliopolis was, strictly speaking, the two Enneads. Thus it has appeared that we must make a distinction between two entities which genuinely are quite different from each other: first, the lineage of Horus which, except for Horus himself, consisted of nine deities, and second, a court at Heliopolis which was called the great cor- poration and the Ennead (or, the two En- neads); it seems possible that this latter denotation was also applied to other courts as it occurs in the plural (Pyr. 511, 1064, 1694). The facts that the deities of the lineage as well as the corporation were regarded, by their very nature, as having originated in the primeval beginning, and that accidentally the number nine played a role in both, led to their early equation. A thorough study of the Ennead and of the merger of the two entities is still wanted, however. Until this will have been made, it is methodologically correct and necessary to accept the distinction rather than the equation of the pedigree and the Ennead as a working hypothesis in any relevant study. (k) ISIS AND NEPHTHYS Isis, "the throne," and Nephthys, "that which rules (inside) the house," appear to be deified objects which were closely re- lated to the king, just as Hathor is the deified house or hall of the king Horus (see above, paragraph h). I shall discuss Isis and Nephthys incidentally in the con- text of the Mesektet-Mandjet-boat in a forthcoming paper in the Zeitschrift fiir agyptische Sprache, though probably not conclusively. (1) THE FIRST THREE GENERATIONS OF THE PEDIGREE. TEFNUT The Pyramid Texts mention the an- thropomorphic though unnatural bringing into existence of Shu and Tefnut on the part of Atum by himself (Pyr. 1248, 1652). There exists also a cosmic concept accord- ing to which "Shu with Tefnut" were cre- ated by "Atum with Ruruty" as the latter's "serpent-body" (Pyr. 447; see ceeding m3, "die Gitterneunheit schuf das Sehen," but Junker's interpretation of the context, which is definitely convincing, eliminates this understanding of the text.</page><page sequence="30">198 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Sethe's comment and the slightly different translation with notes in my paper, "Der Gebrauch des Wortes _dt 'Schlange, Schlangenleib' in den Pyramidentexten"). Furthermore, the Pyramid Texts mention the fact that Shu lifted the sky, Nut, while apparently Geb is not mentioned in this context (e.g., 299 a, 1454, 2091; cf. 1778 b). Among the figures who represent the first three generations of the pedigree, Atum, Geb, and Tefnut present special problems. Atum is discussed below, in paragraphs s, t, and v, and Geb, in para- graph q. My attempt to reach some under- standing of the individual character of Tefnut within the limits of the evidence presented in the Pyramid Texts has failed. However, a brief report on this evi- dence might help to support a sugges- tion which is based on that of Sethe. Tef- nut occurs twenty-seven times in Sethe's edition of the Pyramid Texts (Pyr. 5 d, which presents the writing , should be added to Speleers' list of occurrences, Les textes des pyramides 6gyptiennes II, Vocabulaire [Bruxelles, 1924], p. 118). The expression sw hnc Tfnt, "Shu with Tef- nut," occurs eight times (Pyr. 447, 1248, 1353, 1443, 1521, 1546, 1985, 2099); Sw Tfnt as a distinct unit, once (Pyr. 1654); and otherwise Tefnut is paralleled in wording and idea with Shu nine times (552, 553, 842, 1066, 1652, 1691, 1739, 2053, 2065). In all these eighteen cases, Tefnut is nothing more than a supplement to Shu. In addition, her name occurs placed between Shu and Geb three times in evocations and enumerations (Pyr. 169, 1655, 1662), and twice she is mentioned as the mother of Nut (Pyr. 5, 779). There re- main four cases in which she occurs. Pyr. 990 and 1405 express the idea that she guides or takes the deceased, NN, in the same manner as she guides him together with Shu (cf. Sethe's comment on 990 b). In Pyr. 288 a and 317 a, tfnt appears to be an appellative, which will be discussed below. The lack of an individual substance of Tefnut which is evident in her close con- nection with Shu, may or may not be indi- cated also by the following features: the parallelism of Shu and Tefnut with other pairs of primeval deities (Pyr. 446-47, 1691); their appearance in the dual ntrwy (Pyr. 447 a, 1985 b, c; cf. the dual in 1248 d); their later equation with what was then the dual rwty, "the two lions," which appears as a singular entity rwrwty in the Pyramid Texts as a supplement of Atum (Pyr. 447 a; here the two pairs are somewhat identified with each other by means of the "serpent-body," see above the beginning of the present paragraph 1); the addition of Tefnut to Shu, where it appears superfluous (Pyr. 1443 b, 2052 b- 2053 a); and the fact that the epithets of Shu and Tefnut in Pyr. 1661 a/1662 a-to which mns(3) in 1353 b, c may be com- pared-are virtually identical. The cosmic character of Shu as the one who carries the sky appears in Shu and Tefnut in Pyr. 1443 b, which might have prompted the idea of their taking NN which has been mentioned above. The relation with mois- ture which is a common characteristic of Shu and Tefnut (Pyr. 842, 2065), may genuinely belong to Shu and not to Tefnut like all the other features which appear in both (Pyr. 552 a and 553 a). The preceding summary shows the fea- tures of Shu in the composite concept of Shu and Tefnut, and nothing which is characteristic of Tefnut alone. I do not think that this picture is changed by Pyr. 288 a, which reads: "the hkn-wtt-serpent is upon her dcm-support, the tfnt of NN, who elevates (tw3t) Shu." Sethe's com- ment on this passage may provide us with</page><page sequence="31">EGYPTIAN THEOLOGY IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. 199 the clue to the problem. He has concluded that there tfnt is an appellative which means something like "sister" and is iden- tical with the name of Tefnut, while NN is identified with Shu. Thus the tfnt of NN is at the same time the tfnt of Shu and ap- parently represents a unit with either, as the serpent and her dcm-support represent a unit. I should think that the word tfnt became the very name "Tefnut" as an in- dication that this goddess was just the supplement to Shu. Pyr. 288 a T, in an apparent contradiction to P, reads the dual tfnty. This perhaps may be explained as a dual like s3ty, "son and daughter," in- dicating Shu and Tefnut (WB, III, p. 412.9-12); this dual would mean tfn and tfnt (see below), and it would have er- roneously replaced the singular in this phrase. The explanation of tfnt as "the female counterpart" would also make easier to understand Pyr. 317 a, wd~n NN tfn hnc tfnt. This was translated in JNES, XIII, 33, "NN judged between male and female orphan (?)," and my comment on Pyr. 317, ibid., pp. 35-36, was concluded with the statement, "whatever the exact meaning of tfn and tfnt might be, these designations apparently refer to human society and not to a myth." I think now that the phrase should be translated either "NN judged between whoever he was and whoever she was," or, since the expression tfn 4nc tfnt is reminiscent of the popular combination Sw hnc Tfnt, perhaps more correctly, "NN judged men and women." In fact, Pyr. 317 a-b deals with the proce- dure of a lawsuit, and not with the parties concerned. It fits the context very well if these latter are referred to in general terms. Thus I think that Sw hnc Tfnt means something like "Shu and 'the woman,' " and the name of Tefnut should be paraphrased as "she who supplements Shu to make a pair." (m) THE DROWNING OF OSIRIS AND OTHER POSSIBLE ALLUSIONS TO COSMIC IDEAS IN THE TALE OF OSIRIS The drowning of Osiris, or rather his floating in the water, presumably mirrors the fact that the cultivated land sub- merges in the annual inundation of the Nile. It is mentioned in Pyr. 24 d, 615 d, 766 d, all three times in a context which is reminiscent of the Memphite Theology; see Sethe's comment on Pyr. 615 a-d. While the drowning and the tak- ing of the corpse of Osiris out of the water is an important element in the proceedings according to the Memphite Theology, however, it apparently is not connected with the tale in the Pyramid Texts ac- cording to which Osiris was found where he was slain, i.e., in Ghsty or Ndit (e.g., Pyr. 1008 c, 1799 b; see further below, paragraph p). The denomination of Horus as "the one who came forth from the Nile (4cpy)" (Pyr. 2047 c), probably does not indicate a cosmological concept of the birth of Horus, but it is worth mentioning. Furthermore, the character of Seth as the murderer of his brother appears closely correlated with the hostility of the desert and its murderous heat, and the destruc- tion of the testicles of Seth may recall the sterility of the desert. In any event, the question how the cosmic and the royal character of Seth are correlated represents a problem which cannot be solved here. Finally, the motif of the Eye of Horus, which will be discussed in the following paragraph, may be mentioned here. (n) THE BROTHERS HORUS AND SETH. THE FIGHTS The fact that Seth was the brother of both Horus and Osiris is borne out in our interpretation of the pedigree, inasmuch as Seth killed his brother, Horus, who con- sequently became Osiris. Naturally, the</page><page sequence="32">200 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES brother of Seth is mostly the deceased, Osiris, in the Pyramid Texts. I know only of one sentence in which Seth is called the brother of Horus: "the eye of Horus exults(?) upon the wing of his brother Seth" (Pyr. 1742). This must be under- stood in comparison with Pyr. 594, 976, et al., although there it is the wing of Thoth and not Seth upon which the eye was saved; see above, paragraph a, for the in- terrelation of Horus, Seth, and Thoth. I should like to take this opportunity to anticipate a discussion of the fight of Horus and Seth since this must precede that of the tale of Osiris in paragraph p. Since Horus was the living king and Osiris the deceased one, the slaying of Osiris was strictly speaking the slaying of Horus, who in consequence of his being slain, became Osiris. The realization that a fight between Horus and Seth could well have taken place, in the logical sequence of events as reported in a tale, before Horus, the son, was born, throws new light on that particular feature of the tale where Horus, the son, felled Seth, regained the eye of Horus, and restored it to Osiris; for Osiris, who was Horus when he lost it, was its genuine owner. This felling Seth and restoring the eye to Osiris took place after Seth was condemned by Geb and his court, according to Pyr. 578 a-579 a: "(578 a) He (scil. Horus) caused that the gods rescued you (scil. Osiris). (b) Geb put his sole upon the head of your enemy who had escaped you (? hm n.k). (c) Your son, Horus, smote him. (d) He took his eye from him and gave it to you. (579 a) You are a b3-soul thereby and you are mighty (4im) thereby, the foremost of the iw- beings." Whilethelastline probably refers to Osiris NN, who is appealed in this spell, the preceding obviously pictures a certain situation of the mythical past (see Sethe's introduction to Spell 356, to which Pyr. 578/9 belongs). We should not understand "the eye of Horus" in this context as a metaphor of either the crown or the of- fering, although such a metaphoric inter- pretation is well justified in the references to the same event in the offering rituals (e.g., Pyr. 29) and elsewhere (see below for examples). In fact, the interpretation of the eye of Horus as the crown does not make much sense in the context of the felling of Seth. It would be hard to im- agine that Horus after his justification and nomination as the king felled Seth, took the crown from him, and gave it to Osiris, while a mere felling and binding of Seth on the part of Horus appears to be a plausible enough act of punishment and protection (Pyr. 1007 c). Horus, rather, would have taken the crown for himself, and this is exactly what happened accord- ing to Pyr. 831, 1237 e, 1239 b, and 1614 b. There the meaning of the "eye of Horus" is evidently the crown, as it is also in the more vague metaphorical sentences mean- ing "Horus gives his eye to NN" (Pyr. 634 d, 1240 c; cf. also 139 c). In conclusion, there is a story indicated, according to which Horus took the real eye of Horus, and neither the crown nor the offering, to his father Osiris after he felled Seth. If my reasoning is right, we must dis- tinguish three fights in the tale of Osiris according to the Pyramid Texts. The first fight was that of Horus "senior" with Seth, in which the eye of Horus was torn out, the testicles of Seth were torn off, and Thoth was involved either on behalf of or against Horus (Pyr. 594; cf. 535 c T, 976 a-b; also 163 d). This fight is referred to wherever the eye and the testicles are mentioned together in the Pyramid Texts (418, 679, 946, 1463 e). It seems to be also referred to in Pyr. 1350 b, where we are told of the anonymous fighters who both fell in Hry-ch3, and probably in 1242 b-c, according to which the eye eventually was taken from Seth, in the third fight, in</page><page sequence="33">EGYPTIAN THEOLOGY IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. 201 Heliopolis, "at the place where they (had) fought." Thus the first fight took place in Hry-ch., in Heliopolis. The second fight, which was really an act of brutality, was the slaying of Horus "senior," who after his death was referred to as Osiris. This murder took place in Ndit or Gh.ty (e.g., Pyr. 972, 1956; cf. 1008). The third fight, which was really an act of punishment, was that in which Horus "junior" felled Seth, took the eye of Horus out of the head of Seth, and restored it to Osiris, to whom it belonged (Pyr. 578, 591; cf. 1007 c). The eye, we have seen, was re- gained in Heliopolis and Hry-ch, and the restitution took place after Horus had sought and found Osiris at the very place where the latter had been slain, Gh.ty (Pyr. 1799; cf. 1860 c). A dispute of the gods with Seth perhaps preceded this third fight (Pyr. 595-96; cf. also 957-60, 1219 d, which will be discussed below in paragraph p), and certainly Horus acted with the consent of Geb and the court (Pyr. 578; cf. also 1242 a). Another ver- sion tells us that it was Geb, and not Horus, who sought and found Osiris in Gh.ty (Pyr. 1033 b) and gave him the eye of Horus (Pyr. 139 c); this presumably was thought to be the crown of Egypt and nothing else in this context. Another ver- sion concerning the restitution appears to be Pyr. 535 and 946, according to which the eye and the testicles were given to their owners by what seems to be a minor figure. Pyr. 1242 is somewhat intricate as there NN performs the function of Horus, the son of Osiris, while in 1240 c, where he is given the eye of Horus by Horus, he is not expressly identified with Osiris and may only be the king. The third fight represents the cornec- tion of a wrong which was done to (Ho- rus-)Osiris, namely, the regaining of the eye and its restoration to its owner, Osiris. This correction of a wrong deed has been elaborated on in the Pyramid Texts by means of the introduction of Geb and the court into this story and of the equation of the eye of Horus with the crown of Egypt. These two additional elements, however, represent the factors of another restitution, that of the kingship of Osiris to his son and heir, Horus. Thus we are here dealing with a dual restitution, that of the eye of Horus to Osiris by means of the felling of Seth, and that of the king- ship of Osiris to Horus by means of the decree of Geb and his corporation. Like- wise, a duality is found in the wrong which was done to Horus-Osiris, first, in the theft of the eye, and second, in the slaying. It looks as if two independent stories were here connected. One would have been that of the fight between Seth and Horus(-Osiris), which ended with the mutual wounding and falling and which was finally decided by the retaining of the eye by Horus and its return to its rightful owner, (Horus-)Osiris. The other story would have been that of the slaying of (Horus-)Osiris by Seth and the final resti- tution of the kingship to Osiris' son, Ho- rus, on the part of Geb and his corpora- tion. The first story centered on the eye of Horus, the second on the heritage of Osiris. An important objection, however, must be raised to the assumption that these two stories had originated independently. While the eye of Horus was taken from Seth in Hry-ch., where the first fight had taken place, it was restored to Osiris in Gh~ty, where Osiris had been slain. This indicates a close connection between the two stories. I do not think that it would be correct to explain this fact as a mere indi- cation of the complete fusion of two inde- pendent stories. The restoration of the eye in G h.ty is so well attested that we must not assume that the name Gh.ty stands for that of another place which would have</page><page sequence="34">202 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES been the original one. I should prefer to conclude that the regaining of the eye in Heliopolis and its restoration in Gh4ty was most probably invented to adapt the con- cept of the Eye of Horus to the story of the restitution of the kingship of Osiris to his son, Horus. If I am right, we are deal- ing with two basic elements of the tale of Osiris. The first was the fight of Horus and Seth in Heliopolis with the mutual wound- ing. The original end of this story may or may not have been that both the eye and the testicles were restored to their owners; see Pyr. 535 and 946, which have been mentioned above. The second element was the story of the murder of Osiris and the restoration of his kingship to his son Horus by means of the verdict of Geb and his court. The fusion of these two elements necessitated the harmonizing of the out- come of both. Therefore a new episode was added to the procedure before the court in Heliopolis, namely, that Horus felled Seth there, regained the eye and re- stored it to his father at the place where the latter had been slain. The fusion was completed by the introduction of Geb, who presided over the court, into the story of the restoration of the eye, and by the fact that the eye of Horus was regarded as the crown of Egypt. While this reconstruc- tion of the origin of the tale of Osiris may appear plausible, it should be added that we may also think of still another possi- bility: it is not out of the question that the first fight between Horus and Seth was also invented. This would then have been done with the intention of extracting the concept of the Eye of Horus from what- ever its genuine context had been, and of harmonizing it with the concept of the lineage in which Seth had become the foe of Horus. A discussion of the Eye of Horus is far beyond the limits of this paper. I should like to point out, however, that I have concluded in my paper, "Der Gebrauch des Wortes dt 'Schlange, Schlangenleib' in den Pyramidentexten," that there existed a genuine identity of the dt-serpent with both the Eye of Horus and the uraeus- serpent, and not merely an incidental one. Whatever this may mean, it seems to fit in the interpretation of Horus as presented above, in paragraph a, according to which Horus was not primarily a celestial con- cept. It may look as if the concept of the Eye of Horus was genuinely connected with the kingship of Egypt rather than with any celestial appearance. This may help to explain the existence of a necessity for connecting as closely as possible the Eye of Horus with the story of Horus, the son of Osiris. In conclusion, I may repeat that, to my understanding, the Eye of Horus, the fight between Horus and Seth in Hry-ch., the felling of Seth in Hry-ch, and the restora- tion of the eye to Osiris in Gh4ty belong to- gether. They represent an element which does not genuinely belong to the tale of Horus, the son of Osiris, although it is fused with it. The understanding that di- verse elements are involved in the tale is not new. However, it now appears to me better substantiated than it had been be- fore. (o) DEFINITIONS OF SOME RELEVANT EX- PRESSIONS. FAITH AND REASON IN MYTHOLOGICAL CONCEPTIONS The following definitions39 may appear acceptable in the context of this paper. A "mythological concept" represents a hu- man attempt to understand a figure or an 39 I have avoided the term "myths," which has often been misunderstood. I may refer to two books dealing with myths in which I think there are excellent interpretations: B. Malinowski, Myth in Primitive Psychology (New York: Norton and Co., 1926) and A. W. Watts, Myth and Ritual in Christianity (New York: Vanguard Press, without date). Cf. too my note on Malinowski's book, JAOS, LXXIV, 39, n. 7. -I have used the the term "mythical" passim in the sense of "belonging to the divine world."</page><page sequence="35">EGYPTIAN THEOLOGY IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. 203 event, or a group of figures and a sequence of events, which belong to "the divine world." "The divine world" encompasses whatever cannot be explained by human reasoning and sensuous perception, al- though it appears to exist. No entity of the divine world can be grasped by the human mind except by means of a symbol. While not every symbol is a mythological concept, every mythological concept is symbolical of an entity of the divine world. "Egyptian mythology" is the sum of all Egyptian mythological concepts. "Egyp- tian religion" is the administered manifes- tation of the consensus of the ancient Egyptians for a common use of symbols which express the interdependence of the human and the divine world. "Egyptian theology" is the dealing of the Egyptian sages with Egyptian mythology and other religious symbols in constructive and in- terpretative activities. Religious symbols are expressed either in words (e.g., hymns, prayers, tales, and rituals) or in actions (dramatic perform- ances and other forms of rites), or in ob- jects and pictures (e.g., images and em- blems). Virtually every performance of these expressions causes, is, or recalls, a true spiritual experience. Most mythologi- cal concepts may be experienced in all the three ways of experience. The variety of expressions of a mytho- logical concept must not be confused with the variety of Egyptian mythological con- cepts which symbolize the same entity of the divine world. This variety is most striking. I may exemplify it with the mythological concepts of the entity "sky." The Pyramid Texts refer to heaven sometimes as the kbhw-waters and some- times as the woman, Nut. Furthermore, there are allusions to the concepts of the sky as a cow and of a vulture, with both of which Nut is identified (see above, para- graph c, and for Nut as a cow, MDAIK, XV, 6). Finally, there exist the rationalis- tic ideas that the sky was either a roof resting upon four supports or a bow. Evi- dently all these concepts were accepted as truth by the same theologians. A still more striking example is found in the picture of the heavenly cow in the royal tombs of the New Kingdom.40 Four concepts of the sky, namely, the cow, the water through which Re sails, Nut who is raised by Geb, and the pillars of the roof guarded by deities, are united in one picture. Since we find many simultaneous varieties of repre- sentations of heaven, for instance, with the cow replaced by Nut and the sun boats replaced by the rolling sun-disk, we may say with certainty that none of these pic- tures was taken as a reality at its face value. Nobody except perhaps completely unsophisticated people would have said that the sky was a cow with her belly raised up by Geb, two boats sailing along her belly, and her legs supported by eight deities. Doubtless, however, each one of these four concepts was regarded as truth, while their interconnection in one picture was an artistic concept. What I think is the only reasonable ex- planation of this fact may first appear too theoretical because it seems hardly com- patible with our ideas of the "primitive" mood of thinking and their application to the Egyptians. We must conclude from the evidence of the Pyramid Texts that the Egyptians of the third millennium B.C. were very much aware of the fact that no symbol can possibly encompass the whole reality of that for which it stands and, consequently, the more mythological concepts of a certain divine entity that 40 Most recent publication of text and pictures: A.

They evidently distin- guished between the truth of a mythologi- cal concept and the true essence of that entity for which it stands as a symbol. I may illustrate this attitude by a fictitious assumption. No Egyptian theologian of 2400 B.C. who would read Genesis, chap. i, would think it meant that God really cre- ated the world in six days, while yet he would gladly accept this concept as true. He would think that it makes various as- pects of the greatness of God, which sur- passes human understanding, clear in an incomparably impressive symbolic tale without any falsehood. Furthermore, he would likewise accept Gen. 2:4 ff. as a true concept of the creation in spite of any contradictions to the former account. The difference between his mood of religious thinking and ours (or, what we often think is the natural one) is, in my opinion, that ours is rigidly bound in unchangeable doc- trines while his is not. We have often blamed the ancient Egyptians because of the lack of logic which is evident in the variety of their mythological concepts. Probably they would blame us for the tendency to submit our understanding of the truth of our mythological concepts to logical and historical criticism. Indeed, the truth of a mythological concept can- not possibly depend on the question whether the events which it describes hap- pened in reality. It depends solely on the question whether or not it makes some- thing of the "divine world" conceivable to mankind. A criterion for it would be based on experience and faith, and not on logics and reason. We have often concluded from the lack of logic which is evident in the variety of mythological concepts that the Egyptians as a rule were not ready to think logically in matters of mythology. Consequently, we thought that we could do without the simplest rules of logic in any interpreta- tion of Egyptian mythological features. I think this was a mistake. An entity which belongs to what we have called the divine world appears in terms of human logic and sensuous perceptibility when it is con- ceived as a symbol. A symbol must, there- fore, necessarily satisfy both faith and rea- son. It is true that some mythological con- cepts in Egyptian religion, as well as in other religions, do not correspond with the possibilities of reality; for instance, the birth of Shu and Tefnut and the post- humous engendering of Horus. Presum- ably concepts like these were unavoidable for one reason or another. While the laws of nature may be disregarded in mytho- logical concepts, however, it is most prob- able that the rules of logic were main- tained. After all, even the most fantastic fairy tale would not appeal to men if it was not logical. Creative interpretation of history is based on the well-founded assumption that men acted, let us say, politically and militarily, with reason, meaning the due exercise of the faculty of logical thought, in exactly the same degree in the past as people act today, notwithstanding the more recent development of the science of logic. We must refute the strange idea that this presumption does not hold good in the field of religion. It is true that the realm of human logic and sensuous per- ception has immensely widened today in comparison with that which was valid five thousand years ago. It may be questioned with good reason, however, whether, in consequence, the realm of what we have called the divine world must have dimin- ished. I do not think that the approach of men to the divine world has basically changed. The difference between the mythological concepts of the past and those of today is quantitative rather than qualitative. It may be useful to exemplify the pre- ceding discussion with two simple facts</page><page sequence="37">EGYPTIAN THEOLOGY IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. 205 which we have discussed above. I have mentioned, in paragraph i, that each one of the texts, Pyr. 741, 1703, and 2052-53, names two different mothers of NN in one sentence. These names indicate different mythological concepts of the deceased king, NN, each of which was thought to be true as it bore a distinct religious meaning, even though these concepts were not com- patible with each other to the logical mind. In another context, in paragraph j, I have mentioned the modern interpreta- tion that the name "the Ennead," "the Nine Gods," originated in the number nine of those gods who represent the line- age of Horus. I have refuted this idea be- cause this identification is hardly at- tested, while, as a rule, the names vary and the number of the names exceeds nine. If the name, "the Ennead," was really invented for those nine individual gods, it would not have made sense to re- place some of their names at random by others, to omit and to insert names, and to enlarge the number ad libitum. If the name of the Ennead indicated an anony- mous group of nine gods, however, it ap- pears quite plausible that any intention to name its members resulted in a variety of names and in an increase of names. It is, of course, difficult to decide in every case whether we are dealing with (if I may say so) a "religious truth" or a "logical truth" in a certain Egyptian re- ligious text. Notwithstanding the variety of mythological concepts, however, we should base our criteria upon the assump- tion that the Egyptians used their com- mon sense in religious matters no less than in other affairs of their life. (p) THE TALE OF OSIRIS AND HORUS IN THE PYRAMID TEXTS Those who prepared the Pyramid Texts and used them in their present form ex- perienced the transition of their deceased king, who had been Horus, into the figure of Osiris, and they endeavored to effect the transfiguration of Osiris into a heav- enly being like Re. The performance of a mythological procedure is closely related with the assumption that it mirrors an event which took place in the past. Ac- cordingly, they looked on Osiris as a figure of a remote past (e.g., Pyr. 622 b, 1558 b), and tales about Osiris and his relatives are attested in the description of many events which were thought to have taken place in the past (e.g., Pyr. 594, 957-60, 1219 d, 2089 a). These events apparently fit into what seems to be a coherent story of Osiris, and we are entitled, to begin with, to assume such a coherence in the follow- ing examination of its details. We shall examine each major element of the story with regard to which context it originated in. The main question is whether we can trace all the elements of the tale of Osiris back to the character of the Horus-Osiris king and his lineage as these have trans- pired in the course of this paper, or whether we may assume another source, such as the reminiscence of a historical king or a folktale concerning the murder of a man, his faithful widow, and their successful son. We have already discussed two ele- ments of the tale which do not appear di- rectly related to those procedures which, according to our conclusions, accom- panied the transformance of Horus into Osiris and that of the human crown prince into the god Horus. The first was the drowning of Osiris, references to which oc- cur incidentally and apparently without connection with the proceedings of the story. We have assumed that this element originated in the cosmic aspect of Osiris (see above, paragraph m). The second in- cidental element, though closely inter- woven with the main story, was the tale of the fights between Horus and Seth (see above, paragraph n). We have concluded that this served for, or was the product of,</page><page sequence="38">206 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES the insertion of the concept of the Eye of Horus into the story of king Horus and his father, Osiris. The statement that this ele- ment did not genuinely belong to the story of Osiris and Horus holds good, as I think, regardless of what the genuine con- nection between the early dynastic con- cept of Horus being the trinity of the fal- con, the earthly king, and the heavenly ruler on the one hand, and the Eye of Horus on the other hand, may have been. As to the other elements of the story of Osiris, we may consider, first, the names. The name of Seth is attested as that of a deity who is a supplement and not an ad- versary of the king Horus in the early dy- nastic period and in the Pyramid Texts (see Bonnet, Reallexikon, p. 706, and above, n. 31). We must, I think, conclude that his character as a murderer presum- ably was an outgrowth from that Horus- Seth concept of early kingship. According to the interpretation of the lineage of Horus which is presented here in Section I, the idea that Seth was the murderer was based on the fact that he was "the brother," the peer of Horus. Indeed, if Seth had first come as a murderer into the concept of kingship, from the outside, he could hardly have turned out to be an equivalent and supplement of Horus; this would have been too much reconciliation. Thus the figure of Seth represented a basic element of the kingship in Egypt, and it belongs as such in the story of Osiris and Horus. Likewise, the names of Isis and Nephthys appear to have originated in the context of Egyptian kingship (see above, paragraph k). The name of Horus cer- tainly indicated the king from the begin- ning of history. Although a discussion of the name of Osiris may appear worth- while in general, it is not necessary here. According to our interpretation of the lineage, his name genuinely indicated the cosmic concept of vegetation, and he en- tered the group which represented the lineage of Horus on this basis only. No alternate evidence exists. Second, the idea of the slaying of Osiris was rooted in the concept of the lineage because this originated in the assumption that the death of the god, the divine king, could not have taken place except by mur- der. References to the slaying are given above, in paragraph n, where it is men- tioned as "the second fight." Third, the dismemberment of the body of Osiris may or may not be attested as an element of the tale of Osiris in the Pyra- mid Texts. I have noted it only in refer- ence to the deceased king, NN. Whether or not this observation is correct, the dis- memberment must be understood as origi- nating in the predynastic and early dy- nastic custom of dismembering the corpse of an apparently distinguished man. See Bonnet, Reallexikon, s. v. "Leichenzer- stiickelung," and Pyr. 316 c according to its interpretation in JNES, XIII, 34. Thus, this item came into the picture from the tradition of burial customs. Fourth, the search for Osiris by his sis- ters perhaps reflects ceremonies of the vacancy of "the throne," Isis, and what- ever her peer "that rules the house," Nephthys, might be. This assumption may be corroborated by a parallelism. In Pyr. 971-72, we are told that "the ladder of Seth" being "the ladder of Horus" was seeking for its "brother Osiris" after his murder at Gh.ty. The ladder of Seth in this text has been plausibly interpreted by S. Schott in S. A. B. Mercer, The Pyramid Texts, IV, 108, as the bier of the deceased king. Since the bier is the resting place of the deceased king just as the throne is the resting place of the living one, this search by the ladder well corresponds to that by Isis, the throne. See further above, para- graph n, for the seeking for Osiris by Horus and Geb; this belongs in the con-</page><page sequence="39">EGYPTIAN THEOLOGY IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. 207 text of the Eye and has nothing to do with the search of Isis and Nephthys. Fifth, "the two drt-kites of Osiris" (Pyr. 308) presumably are birds which appear in pairs waiting either for a serpent (Pyr. 230 b, according to Sethe's com- ment) or for the offal from the preparation of the corpse (Pyr. 308 e, in deviation from Sethe's comment). They were then identified with the mourning women as either "the two drt-kites" (Pyr. 1254 a) or "h3t-kite and drt-kite" (Pyr. 1255 d, 1280 b) because they were permanent attend- ants of the body before its interment. This item, therefore, originated in the burial customs, and the kites were identified with the sisters Isis and Nephthys in the context of the royal funerals. Sixth, the posthumous birth of Horus in the tale corresponds to the fact that the new Horus king came into existence after the death of his father and predecessor. The Pyramid Texts, however, already ap- pear to indicate the idea that Horus was engendered, and not only born, posthu- mously (Pyr. 632 a, according to Sethe's comment; 1635-36). This might indeed be a fictitious elaboration, but we may just as well wonder whether or not it means that the right of the heir to the throne ex- isted only if he was engendered when his father was already the king. So he was then a king "in the egg" as later texts ex- press it. Seventh, I am not ready to say any- thing about Khemmis (e.g., Pyr. 1214 b/ 1215 b, 1703 c, 2190 a/2191 a) because I have not yet studied the questions con- cerning Buto. Nevertheless, we know that the town of Buto, with which Khemmis was connected in one way or another, played a role in the ceremonies concerning the king (see Pyr. 697, 1089). Possibly it played a role, therefore, also in the pro- ceedings which led to the nomination of the king (cf., e.g., Pyr. 1242 b). Eighth, the story of the victory of the youthful Horus over the serpent (Pyr. 663-64; cf. 244 b, 444 b, and also 681) was perhaps a fictional element of the sort which occurs elsewhere in the heroic tales of world literature. This would be quite understandable notwithstanding the ques- tion whether or not the story of Horus and the snake was the prototype of the others. However, this element may also have a connection with Buto and its serpent- goddess W3dt. Ninth, the procedure in court on behalf of Horus against Seth (e.g., Pyr. 957-60, 1219 d, and 2089 with the comment on it in JNES, XIII, p. 43) mirrors the proce- dure which preceded the nomination of the king; see above, paragraph h with ref- erences. We have already seen that per- haps the felling and binding of Seth, un- doubtedly the search for Osiris by Horus and Geb, and the restitution of his eye all belong in the tale concerning the Eye of Horus. Tenth, other details of the end of the story are connected with the final finding of Osiris: the icb, "being concerned with (?)," the ip, "recognizing (?)," which Horus made with respect to Osiris (see Sethe's comments on Pyr. 584 b and 587 a respectively), "the glorious and great word" (Pyr. 1523 a), and "the great and good word" (Pyr. 1558 b) which Thoth and Horus respectively told Osiris, and by which the latter became great or was as- signed by Anubis to the heavenly gods. Insofar as these elements belonged to the tale, they undoubtedly originated in the funeral rites for the deceased king. Although I cannot be certain, I think that the ten elements which I have dis- cussed here virtually cover the tale of Osiris as it appears in Sethe's edition of the Pyramid Texts, except for the drown- ing of Osiris and the elements concerning the Eye of Horus, and the fights between</page><page sequence="40">208 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Horus and Seth, as discussed in para- graphs m and n. Thus it has appeared that the decisive elements of the tale of the king Osiris and his son, Horus, can, with one substantial exception, be traced back with some cer- tainty to what I think was its early dy- nastic origin, namely, the rites which were prompted by the death of the king of Egypt and the nomination of his succes- sor. This statement includes the drowning of Osiris because the cosmic aspect of Osiris belonged to his composite character which came into existence, as I see the situation, during the formal questioning of the heir to the throne. Perhaps some emotional fictitious elements were added to this mythological tale, but nothing necessitates us to assume that either his- torical tradition or folklore substantially, if ever, contributed to the formation of the tale. The only sector of the tale of Osiris and Horus which, to our knowledge, did not originate in the royal ceremonies concern- ing burial and nomination was the story of the fights between Horus and Seth which centered on the Eye of Horus. It should be noted that we have concluded, in paragraph n, that most probably the final fight, and perhaps also the first one, was invented as a means of blending the concept of the Eye of Horus into the story of Horus, the son of Osiris. We may conclude this paragraph with the following statement. The mythologi- cal concept concerning Osiris and Isis, and Horus and Seth, existed in the form of a tale of logical continuity already in the time when the Pyramid Texts were cut in stone. This tale had originated in the con- cept of the lineage of Horus and it had been artificially enlarged by episodes which connected the concept of the Eye of Horus with that of the lineage. Although this statement appears conclusive, I may say frankly that I do not feel quite satis- fied. Let us hope that in the future a better understanding of the Eye of Horus will answer the question why it was fused into the story of Horus, the son of Osiris. The interrelation of Horus, Seth, and Thoth must also be examined on the basis of our findings and may well chance to contrib- ute to a better understanding. (q) GEB When I first prepared this paragraph I thought that the conspicuous position of Geb as a ruler and king could not possibly have originated in the concept of the pedi- gree and most probably not in the time preceding it, i.e., in the prehistoric period. I was inclined to be quite satisfied with admitting an "ignoramus" with respect to this problem for the time being. However, when I checked on the Pyramid Texts in regard to Geb exclusively, I was impressed by the prevalence of references to the fact that NN was the son and heir of Geb. Evi- dently these references were closely con- nected with Geb's kingdom and not with his cosmic aspect as the earth. I am in- clined to interpret this evidence in the fol- lowing way. We have seen that the idea that Geb, the earth, was the father of Osiris originated within the context of the pedigree, with the viewpoint that the king was an eternal being. This cosmic aspect of his fatherhood, however, does not ac- count satisfactorily for the multitude of references to the heritage and fathership of Geb. These must be understood as be- longing to the anthropomorphic aspect of the lineage of Horus. While, theoretically, Osiris represented the deceased king as such, without any restriction to time and individuality, it was mainly the funeral and also the pyramid of the individual king which made men conscious of his ex- istence. This means that Osiris was, as a rule, identified with either the owner of an</page><page sequence="41">EGYPTIAN THEOLOGY IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. 209 individual pyramid or with the immediate predecessor and father of the new king, for whom the funeral was held. Then, in the funerals, the ancestry of both the liv- ing and the deceased king was naturally represented by Geb, the father of Osiris. The kingship of both Horus and Osiris, i.e., of Horus-Osiris (see above, paragraph g), was reunited in the figure of Geb. Thus Geb became the representative king of the historical past. This interpretation apparently fully ac- counts for the aspects of Geb as the ruler upon the earth (e.g., Pyr. 1621 a, 1626; cf. 1013 a, 1992 b), the president of the En- nead (e.g., Pyr. 255 b, 1645 b, 1834), and the ruler of the gods (e.g., Pyr. 895 d, 1618 b, 1621 b). While he apparently wears the double crown (Pyr. 1624), occupies the seat of a king (e.g., Pyr. 1538 b, 1922 b-c), and gives the rulership (Pyr. 1475) to his heir (e.g., Pyr. 80 a, 301 a, 1489), he is hardly called a king himself (Pyr. 1626: bity, which apparently refers to Geb). Furthermore, the inter- pretation of Geb as the representative of the royal ancestry clarifies other aspects of Geb, for instance, that he is in heaven (Pyr. 655 d), that he leads NN into the doors of heaven (Pyr. 1115 b; cf. 2096 a) and to his fathers (Pyr. 1300 b), and that he is the great god, the unique one (Pyr. 1616 c). I think that the present inter- pretation accounts for virtually all the references to Geb except a comparatively few in which he is identified as the earth. In conclusion, the concept of Geb as the heavenly ruler may easily be understood as having originated in the concept of the lineage of Horus, and particularly, though not exclusively, in the application of this concept to the funerals of the deceased king. (r) NEFERTEM The early texts which mention Nefer- tem are evaluated in ZAiS, LXXX, 81-89. However, his character and his affinity to Atum was correctly understood only after his name was correctly translated; see ZAS, LXXXII, 1-8. My discussion of this deity in Section I of this paper summarizes the main points of these two papers. The following may be added by the way to my discussion of the word nfr, "the flower of Nefertem, the lotus flower," in ZAS, LXXXII, 2. V. Loret, in "Correspond- ance de Victor Loret" (Kgmi, XIII [1954], 19-20, 21), has discussed this word with what seems to me a plausible sugges- tion that the word nenuphar, "w'ater lily," Arabic nTn&amp;ifar, may be traced back to the Egyptian plural n) nfrw. His statement that n'inffar in Egyptian Arabic denotes Nymphaea Lotus, and not the lotus of Nefertem, Nymphaea Caerulea, however, appears to be contradicted in Webster's New International Dictionary (London, 1926), p. 1447 below, "arab. and pers. nilfifar, ninitfar, probably blue Lotus." It may be useful to mention this divergence here even though it does not make any dif- ference with Nefertem and his blue lotus. (s) THE NAME OF ATUM My interpretation of this name as "the one who has been completed by absorbing the other first living beings" seems to be grammatically corroborated by Pyr. 147 b, hpr.k itmti ntr nb, which is, according to Sethe, in the M. K. hpr.k tmti m ntr nb, and is transmitted with m also in Nt 506. I translate it, "you are coming into exist- ence being completed (being) every god," with an identification of the addressee with "every god." This interpretation vir- tually holds good even if this phrase refers to the succeeding sentence and then should be translated with "diverse dei- ties" rather than "every god." See Sethe's comment on this phrase, which he trans- lates "so wirst du wie Atum zu jedem Gotte," and also the last paragraph of his</page><page sequence="42">210 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES comment on Pyr. 145 a; for the verbal form itmti, which Sethe was not ready to acknowledge as the pseudoparticiple of tm, see now E. Edel, Altdgyptische Gram- matik, ? 577. In following Sethe, we may assume that it is probably Atum who is indirectly addressed with this phrase. Therefore it possibly refers to his very origin in accordance with my interpreta- tion of his name. If this is so, it is not out of the question that the interpretation which is offered in this phrase of Pyr. 147 b is correct, namely, that Atum ab- sorbed every god, and not only the first living beings. But seeing that the doubts which I have indicated with respect to the interpretation of this text exist, I prefer to keep my interpretation of the name for the time being. (t) THE CHARACTER OF ATUM The overwhelming majority of occur- rences of Atum in the Pyramid Texts indi- cates his human character. He is very often called the father of NN (e.g., Pyr. 140 b, 380 a), and he is also the father of Shu (Pyr. 603 b, 1870), of the twins, Shu and Tefnut (e.g., 148 c, 1248 d), of Horus (Pyr. 874 b, 881 b), of the Ennead (Pyr. 1655 c; see above, paragraph i), of "the four" (Pyr. 2057), and of "the son of Atum" (Pyr. 1742 c-d). He gives NN heaven and earth (Pyr. 479 b), the towns and nomes (Pyr. 961, 1475 a), the gods and the Ennead (Pyr. 1473 c, 1617 a). He catches hold of the arm of NN (Pyr. 997 a) and raises the head of NN (Pyr. 1347 a). These are only examples of the human aspect of Atum. The list of the limbs of Atum (Pyr. 135), according to Sethe's comment, indicates that he was conceived in human appearance before Anubis was thought to have a human body. Atum as a cosmic deity is in the dark- ness (Pyr. 605) and in the Naunet out of which he rises shining (Pyr. 207 a-d; cf. 1652 b), and he rises to, or is in, heaven (Pyr. 395 a-b, 992 b; cf. 380). It is striking that his character as the primeval god is more often than not connected with an- other figure. As Atum, he spit out Shu (Pyr. 1871 a; cf. 603 b), and his name is connected with Nunu in various regards (Pyr. 604 a; cf. 605-6 b, 1445-46-47 a, 1525, 1778 b). But it was as Atum- Kheprer that he spit out Shu and Tefnut (Pyr. 1248,41 1652 c), came into existence by himself (Pyr. 1587), and was high and shining as the benben-stone (Pyr. 1652 a- b). He was paired with Ruruty as the crea- tor of Shu and Tefnut (Pyr. 447 a; cf. what appears to be an equation of Atum with Ruruty, 2081 b), and equated with the Naunet as he who gave birth to NN (Pyr. 1466 a-b). In addition to the human and cosmic aspects of Atum, there exists also his ap- pearance as a beast which fights the ser- pent (Pyr. 425). It appears connected in Pyr. 229 with the nhb-kDw-serpent, whose name seems to be as recent as that of Atum himself. The heavenly character of Atum was probably due, on the one hand, to his equation with Kheprer (see below, para- graph u) and, on the other hand, to his assimilation to the king (see below, para- graph v). None of the appearances of Atum was prompted by the fact that the sun-god Re was identified with him as Re- Atum (Pyr. 145, 152-60, 1686 b, 1694 a; cf., e.g., 1347 a, 1695). Most probably some of the characteristics of Atum have helped to complete the character of Re, but it could not possibly have been the other way around. 41 I cannot follow Wsrterbuch, I, 57, in assuming that we are dealing with a noun, iw?3w, in Pyr. 1248 a. The succeeding ir.f seems to indicate that we are con- cerned with a verb. I read the phrase: "Itm (pw) Hpr (r) m(i)Ow ir.f m 'Iwnw, with m(i)63w being either a par- ticiple or a pseudoparticiple (old perfective) in active meaning.</page><page sequence="43">EGYPTIAN THEOLOGY IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. 211 (U) THE PRIMEVAL SERPENT, THE PRI- MEVAL BEETLE, AND THEIR RE- LATIONS TO THE SUN It is a question whether the idea that the primeval being gave life to the sun originated in the prehistoric period or whether it was first conceived with Atum. The primeval egg, the Ogdoad, and what might have been the prototype of the lotus Nefertem are apparently not at- tested in the Pyramid Texts and conse- quently will not be discussed here. The primeval serpent appears to be attested in the Pyramid Texts by the dt-serpent, which I have discussed in the paper men- tioned above, n. 2. While a relation of the dt-serpent with the sun may or may not be found in its genuine equation with the Eye of Horus and the royal uraeus, nothing in- dicates that it has ever been thought to have given life to the sun. The beetle is known in the Pyramid Texts mainly as Kheprer. Kheprer was a concept which was earlier than that of Atum, according to the sequence of the names in the composite, Atum-Kheprer (Pyr. 1652 a). The characteristic of Kheprer was the fact that he was living (Pyr. 561 c and varr.). He "came into ex- istence by himself" (Pyr. 1587 b) and was the father of NN (Pyr. 1210 a). He used his wings (Pyr. 1757 b), had his roads in the sky (Pyr. 305 b), and was found in both the western and the eastern side of the sky (Pyr. 888 b, in parallelism with Re; 2079 c; cf. also "the two daytimes of Kheprer," 2083 d). Thus Kheprer, the primeval being, was the sun himself (Pyr. 1695 a), and not that which gave life to the sun. While this picture appears rea- sonably clear and, as I think, accounts for what we otherwise recognize about Kheprer in the Pyramid Texts, Pyr. 199 a raises a problem. It reads, according to N 719 + 9 (J6quier) and Sethe's transla- tion, "you (NN) shall stand (as the king) above it, (namely,) this land which came forth from Atum (pr m DItm), the saliva (or whatever efflux n's' might mean) which came forth from Kheprer (pr m 6prr)." Sethe's interpretation of these striking statements in a vague metaphori- cal sense is not, and was not intended to be, satisfactory. The solution might be sought in the meaning of pr m. While its meaning "to come forth from" is so well attested that we must not replace it ar- bitrarily by "to come forth as," the fact that either of these English phrases ap- pears to correspond with Egyptian pr m is worthy of consideration.-After the pre- ceding was written, I pointed out, in n. 38, that the preposition m in !pr m should be understood as indicating the basic iden- tity of what comes forth with that from which it comes forth. A similar meaning may possibly also be accepted in the original meaning of pr m; see also pr m in Pyr. 1875 a-b. Both the character of the Kheprer- scarab as the sun and the mention of his nss-efflux prompt the question whether or not the ball which the scarab is supposed to drive in front of himself played an es- sential part in the first concept of the pri- meval beetle. The beetle cnh, "the living one," which occurs three times in virtually identical contexts (Pyr. 1301 c, 1633 c, 2107 c) is definitely not the scarab-beetle; see L. Keimer, "Pendeloques en forme d'insectes," Part I, ASAE, XXXI (1931), on pp. 174-82. Although the cnh-beetle is not indicated as the primeval beetle, it appears difficult to separate it as an en- tirely different concept from Kheprer, who we have seen is expressly indicated as living. Perhaps we may conclude that the primeval beetle first was not especially the scarab but any kind of beetle. Then hprr, "the scarab," might have become promi- nent in the theological concept of the pri- meval beetle because of the affinity of this</page><page sequence="44">212 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES appellative hprr, which then became a name, with the idea of !pr dg.f, "that came into existence by himself." If this assump- tion is right, the ball of the scarab-beetle did not play any role in the original con- cept of the primeval beetle. (V) THE ASSIMILATION OF ATUM TO THE KING OF EGYPT This assimilation is conspicuously at- tested, though not as early as the Old Kingdom, by the double crown of Egypt, which has always been the characteristic headdress of Atum, and, since the Eight- eenth Dynasty, by his epithet nb t3wy, "the lord of the two lands." See further Bonnet, Reallexikon, pp. 72-73. In the Pyramid Texts, the kingship of Atum is alluded to by the following facts, which may be supplemented with others. Atum is he who bestows rulership on NN (see above, paragraph t) and whose heir was NN through Geb (Pyr. 301 b; cf. 1617 a and 1645 b); he presided over the Enneads (Pyr. 304 e T, 1660 c), was the judge in the Naunet (Pyr. 207 b), and his was an ws t-hall (Pyr. 1984 a; see Sethe's com- ment on 905 b). Apparently he was seated upon "the great seat of the gods" between the two 4 m-emblems (Pyr. 1241 b-c), his (regnal?) years are mentioned (Pyr. 258 c), and perhaps the oath was taken on his name (Pyr. 879 b). The further question whether or not Atum and the king, Horus- Osiris, have ever been equated with each other must not be answered in the affirma- tive with Pyr. 518 c P. There NN is identified with Atum who, according to Sethe, perhaps there replaced "den unter- aigyptischen Reichsgott Horus"; see too Kees, Gatterglaube, p. 176, n. 4. An iden- tification expressed in the combination of names occurred to me by chance in the Nineteenth Dynasty epithet, "Osiris- Apis-Atum-Horus in one, the great god," as quoted by H. FTankfort, Kingship and the Gods (Chicago, 1948), pp. 146 and 196, from E. Otto, Beitrdge zur Geschichte der Stierkulte (Leipzig, 1938), p. 32. It might well be that this equation of Osiris-Apis with both Atum and Horus was a reflec- tion of the early concepts that the king, the great god, was Horus and Osiris and that Atum represented both of them.
