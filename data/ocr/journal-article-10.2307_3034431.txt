<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SADDLE AND THE SLEDGE: HUNTING AS COMPARATIVE NARRATIVE IN SIBERIA AND BEYOND HEONIK KWON University of Cambridge This article explores the technology of hunting in the Orochon economy of East Siberia, in which the same animal species, the reindeer, is tamed as well as preyed upon. I discuss the symbolic devices by which the Orochon seek to banish predatory violence from their hunting in particular, and death from their social life in general. I contrast this 'non-predatory' hunting to the predominantly predacious conception of hunting often employed in the description of foraging societies. The article concludes that hunting is not a unified notion reducible to predation but should incorporate culturally-specific representations ofpredation. In medieval Europe, 'breaking the stag' was one of the most celebrated activities of the ruling class. As a complex ritual of butchering the hunted deer, 'stag- breaking' not only represented the social hierarchy but also expressed the aristocratic view of nature as an object of romantic conquest (Le Goff 1988; Thiebaux 1974; Thomas 1983). In his essay on medieval courtly romance, Le Goff analyses the story of Yvain, a knight in King Arthur's court, who goes mad - falls in love with the wild - and turns into a naked savage finally to be hunted down as if he were 'a rutting stag' (Le Goff 1988: 121). Le Goff concludes that the Western genre of epic romance is inseparable in its structure from a particular mode of hunting: the rite of passage from the hero's adventurous departure on a dramatic conquest of the wilderness to his triumphant return to civilization. In his recent study of the imagery of hunting in anthropological thought, Cartmill (1993) presents a captivating analysis of the way in which this 'noble sport' of deer-hunting was transformed further into narratives of human nature in contemporary literature, both scientific and popular, ranging from Ardrey's African genesis (1961) to Felix Salten's Bambi. Focusing on the so-called 'hunting hypothesis of human origin' of Dart (1953), Cartmill discusses hunting as a myth model recurrent in palaeoanthropology in particular and in the Western narratives of human evolution in general (1990; 1993). Cartmill concludes that in Western thought hunting is an 'armed confrontation between humanness and wildness, between culture and nature' and that, as such, it refers solely to instances of'confrontational, premeditated, and violent killing' (1993: 30). If stalking the stag and 'breaking' it into venison was such an important symbolic activity for the European aristocracy (and still is for some of their J. Roy. anthrop. Inst. (N.S.) 4, 115-127</page><page sequence="2">116 HEONIK KWON descendants), for the Orochon hunters in East Siberia hunting the reindeer (Rangtfer tarandus) remains the basis of their subsistence and a principal part of their daily life. They say theygeleni (look for, desire) wild reindeer and bring back the unise (the carcasses of the skinned and butchered animals). As Woodburn (1982: 187) writes of the Hadza hunters in Tanzania, 'the death of the game animals ... is a way of life' for these subsistence hunters. Going a step further than the European deer-hunters, Orochon hunters also capture and tame the reindeer to use them as pack animals. They chase their game on saddled reindeer and collect their kills by reindeer-drawn sledge. Furthermore, like the European gentleman hunter, all Orochon hunters are greatly concerned with the dignity and ceremoniousness of hunting. The Orochon also share with other nomadic peoples in East Siberia a type of 'hunting model of cultural origin': a mythic complex concerning the hunt of a woman who bears the children of a bear and who appears herself as a she-bear. Until the first half of this century this myth was elaborated in periodic rituals of the 'bear feast' (Pilsudskii 1989: 57-65; Vasilev 1948). In their language, the anthropomorphic bear (boyo) is represented as a kind of progenitor of wild reindeer (siro, literally, meaning one-year-old bear cubs) and of wild animals in general (Kwon 1993: 173_7).1 Although it is thus safe to say that confrontational predatory killing is as central to the Orochon tradition as to the European, I will argue that there is a crucial difference in the way the two traditions represent predation. If the conception of hunting is anchored in the events of killing in the latter, as Cartmill suggests, the Orochon hunters conceal the events of death in their oral representation of hunting and in their rhetoric in general. The concealment of death in their hunting narratives includes not only the final moments of the hunted animal but also the mortality of human beings, and it relies upon, as I will show, their skilful use of the saddle and sledge as mnemonic devices. This article thus addresses the predicament of describing a rhetorically non- predatory hunting culture using the analytical concept of hunting as explicitly predacious. I describe how the Orochon hunters come to terms with their predatory activities and compare this to the way in which human predation is represented in Western literature and discuss some similarities and differences between the two types of narrative. Throughout the article, I maintain the position that hunting is not a unified category reducible to predation but should incorporate culturally-specific representations of predation in order to remain a viable analytical concept. In other words, hunting, with or without killing, is itself an ideological construct. The background On a clear winter evening in 1990 in north-central Sakhalin, the Russian Far East, the nomadic Orochon hunters, having just finished their meal, were speaking of the hunting trips they had made during the day. Before the evening meal, there had been a brief radio communication with the state farm administration. I was busy with cooking at that time but was later told that our radio had picked up the communication of a group of hunters near Lake Baikal in West Siberia.2 Hours later, the Orochon men's story-telling was suddenly</page><page sequence="3">HEONIK KWON 117 interrupted by a heated conversation on the use of snowmobiles by the Baikal hunters. The Orochon hunters pointed out to me that they did not approve of using snowmobiles for hunting and trapping trips. Invoking their knowledge of other contemporary nomadic hunters in Siberia, Scandinavia and North America who employ motorized transportation, they emphasized that they themselves would not be able to stand the 'smell' of the fumes, nor the 'noise' of the engines. The Orochon believe that wild reindeer are extremely sensitive to human smells and noises and that one therefore has to take care not to make any noise as well as to approach the prey upwind. According to them, a good hunter also knows how to minimize his 'smell' by, for example, refraining from using soap and spices and from having sex. From this, they conclude that snowmobiles are an ineffective technology for hunters and that it would be irrational to waste money on such things. The Orochon hunters take pride in their 'traditional' means of transportation - the tamed reindeer which they use for riding and for drawing sledges - not necessarily because these are their cultural heritage but because they feel they are technically superior to motorized transportation. While the Orochon hunters reject the use of the snowmobile in hunting, all of them desire to acquire one if they have the means to do so. Snowmobiles are a prestigious item in the village settlement, where hunters' families live,3 and are often used for fishing trips to the rivers near the village, or for driving elders to their friends and relatives within the village. Possessing a snowmobile may create envy in the village, while the absence of snowmobiles in the hunting camp is a source of pride for the hunters. The comments by the hunters on human 'smell' and 'noise' speak of their general theory of hunting as anchored in a skilled concealment of human qualities from the prey. They not only consider the noise of the snowmobile harmful to hunting but also discourage speaking in general when they move in the forest.4 The Orochon men usually go hunting alone, but even when they are obliged to move in groups to hunt a hibernating bear, for instance, or to find a new camping site, it very often happens that not a word is spoken during the whole journey. The encampment (duku), on the contrary, is characterized by odour and noise. There is, above all, the smell of smoke and cooked food, and the hunters talk and shout at the dogs in the camp. Smoke is a sign of human presence. During the rutting season of the wild reindeer, when the bucks become aggressive, a bonfire has to be kept going all day to prevent the wild bucks from attacking the tamed domestic reindeer. Arriving at a new camping site, the hunters first make a fire, boil water and pour a pot of hot water on the ground to announce their temporary occupation of the place. The border between the camp and the forest is not defined by any physical mark but by the region 'where you no longer hear dogs barking'. Hunting as narrative action Each day, however, human 'smell' and 'noise' culminate during the evening meal time when the hunters eat, smoke and talk. They tell stories, in which the animals' behaviour and their movements and the narrator's state of mind and</page><page sequence="4">118 HEONIK KWON actions are all represented in close connexion to one another and to the landscape. In this context, it is not particularly relevant whether or not stories conclude with a successful catch. On the contrary, it is extremely rare for the actual killing and skinning the animal to appear in the story. Missed shots, a confused state of mind, trouble with the tamed animal at a crucial moment, or the beauty of antlers, the location of sable footprints and the traces of Russian geological teams; all of these are more valued narrative products of hunting. Within the encampment, hunting is thus a narrative act. Conversely, this narrative mode of hunting, accompanied by the smell of food and smoke, articulates the space where it takes place in distinction to the surrounding forest, whose space is defined by the very absence of human noise and smell. The hunter's movement between the forest and camp is almost always mediated by the labour of tamed reindeer. The animal's labour is channelled into productive activities by means of the saddle and the sledge. Orochon hunters search for and stalk the game, mostly wild reindeer, on saddled reindeer. The dead animal is beheaded, skinned on the spot and left covered with skin and shrubs. Before the hunter returns to the camp, he installs a few traps around the kill, in which some pieces of the victim's gut are laid in the hope of catching sables and foxes. Within the next few days, the hunter will drive back in his sledge to the sites of his kills and collect the carcasses.5 The path on which the sledge runs (bokto) and the path which the saddle-back rider takes (dorima) are clearly distinguished from each other. The two spaths are often situated on opposite sides of the camp and they never intersect. The sledge path is approximately a straight line, the shortest distance between the camp and the destination. Viewed from the campsite, the material products of hunting (the carcasses of wild reindeer) arrive home along this sledge path. When they are unloaded from the sledge, the carcasses are unise (meat), a collective property expected to be shared. Compared to the sledge path, the saddle path is more visceral in shape, full of sharp turns and detours near the sites of the kills. Along this path, hunters return home seemingly 'empty-handed', and one never sees dead animals. Just as hunters unload animal carcasses when they reach home on the sledge path, so when they unfasten the saddles from the backs of the tamed animals at the end of the saddle path, the hunters also unload their narratives of the hunt. Unlike the collective property of unise brought back by sledge, the stories brought by the saddle belong to the individual hunters. Each hunter has his unique oratorical style, and stories are appreciated not only for their contents but also for the rhetorical skill with which they are told. In regard to the Ilongot hunters in the Philippines, Rosaldo writes that hunting stories are valued because they are tied to the distinctive qualities of individual hunters. According to him, hunting stories concentrate on the actor's ability to respond to the unexpected, 'a quality culturally regarded as crucial in foraging' (Rosaldo 1993: 129). For the Orochon hunters, likewise, amusing events that occur along the saddle path predominate in their stories, whereas it is extremely rare for the acts of butchering the animal and collecting the carcass to develop into narrative accounts. According to Rosaldo, what is hidden in stories is what everybody already knows since 'hunting stories relegate the subject matter of composite accounts (what all hunts have in common) to silence, or to</page><page sequence="5">HEONIK KWON 119 tacit background knowledge' (1993: 129). But when the Orochon storytellers avoid the subject of the death of animals and, like the Ilongot men, relegate this subject matter to silence, it appears that what is hidden in their stories is more than 'composite accounts' already known to everyone. It is reported that Siberian nomadic hunters in general believe that the 'spirit' of an animal, or its disembodied aspect, remains near its carcass in the hope of taking vengeance (Bogoras 1904-9; Lot-Falck 1953; Shirokogoroff 1935; Shternberg 1933). This idea of suspended death entails that violence in the predatory act is not one-sided but reciprocal. The act of killing invokes a potential counter-attack from the prey, and the hunter runs the risk of being stricken with sickness or misfortune by his victim. In this context, 'hunting' encompasses, but nevertheless cannot be reduced to, 'predation': a mere execution of the relationship of domination pre-established between two species which is sustained by one party's technological superiority or greater strength. In Siberia, the position of human hunter as the predator is insecure. As soon as he succeeds in a predatory act, the hunter falls into the position of prey. In this case, predation consists of violent actions reciprocated by the animal prey, and hunting involves not only the skill of finding and pursuing the animal but also the equally important skill of avoiding being preyed upon in turn. Hamayon (1990: 365-72) relates this prey-predator oscillation to the principle of nature-culture reciprocity in Siberian hunting societies. According to her, the death of the human predator is conceptualized in these societies as an ultimate retribution for his prolonged consumption of animal flesh. Then, as Brightman (1993: 186-212) also demonstrates in regard to the hunting practices of the Rock Cree Indians, hunting, far from being the execution of a fixed hierarchical relation of predation, becomes both an exploitative and reciprocal action, characterized by a perilous inter-changeability between the human predator and the human prey. If the death of the prey is not an instantaneous but a suspended event, it may be argued that the saddle and the sledge create a temporal gap between their respective movements and contribute to circumventing the potentially dangerous outcome of predation.6 If the sledge collects animal carcasses as if they were just lying around waiting to be collected, the saddle brings back stories of hunting as if no animals were slaughtered. What lies between the saddle path and the sledge path is, then, a series of actual predatory acts. Seen together, the saddle and sledge appear to remove violent killings from the productive process of hunting and make the process look as if it were part of a gathering economy. The Orochon hunters say, 'To be a good hunter, you have to learn from a cunning fox'. If a cunning fox relies upon its senses to detect the human 'smell' of the trap hidden deep under the snow, or to sense human 'noise' from afar in order not to fall prey to humans, a good hunter is skilled at hiding his 'smell' and 'noise' not only from his potential prey but also from the potential predator.7 Then, their hunting comes to look like a game of hide-and-seek, in which players continually swap the act of seeking for that of hiding. If snowmobiles are rejected by the Orochon hunters on the grounds that they are inefficient at concealing the hunter's human qualities from the prey, the traditional means of transportation has its efficacy in the art of concealing the hunter from the prey which might pursue him.</page><page sequence="6">120 HEONIK KWON Gathering deaths and gathering stories The Orochon sledge is made of panels of birchwood.8 Besides being a vehicle for bringing home carcasses of wild animals, the sledge is also used to carry away the bodies of dead relatives. Like other nomadic peoples in East Siberia, the Orochon traditionally practised xoldosko, which Lopatin translates as 'aerial burial': the exposure of corpses on raised platforms (Lopatin 1960: 117-19; (Pilsudskii 1989: 52). At present, Orochon use the communal state cemetery, located at the centre of the village settlement, which they share with neighbouring Russian settlers. A corpse should remain in the house for two to three days before it is moved by sledge to the burial site. It is removed via the back of the house, not through the front door. In the past, the corpse was carried out through the chono, the back corners of the tent where rifles and amulets were kept. This pre-burial mortuary process entails that death is a 'suspended' event for human beings just as it is for game animals. Pilsudskii reports that if 'the death was unusual, unfortunate', the corpse had to be wrapped in a reindeer skin and guarded by several armed men (1989: 53). This 'guarding the dead' was presumably one of the protective measures 'against the evil influences of the dead' over the living (Czaplicka 1914: 146; also Mazin &amp; Ivanovich 1984: 62- 5).9 Lopatin writes: Practically all the natives of the Amur Basin [a far-eastern region of Siberia] observe the custom of not stopping to look back on returning from a funeral. The meaning of this custom is evidence that the natives are afraid lest the ghost overtake them and return home with them (1960:95). He suggests that their funeral on the whole is a kind of magical protective ceremony and that the method of removing the corpse from the house is also intended to hide the way back from the spirit of the dead and prevent its return by carrying the body 'through a special opening which later is closed up' (1960: 94). For the removal of the corpse, the male agnatic relatives (xala) of the deceased, rather than the reindeer, draw the sledge. The term xala has several meanings. It refers to 'clan' or lineage identity (Magata 1981: 76), while the sledge and the wooden collar worn by tamed reindeer are both also called xala. In conveying the corpse to the burial site, the people of one xala (clan) play the role of the collared beasts of burden for the dead and thus amalgamate the three different meanings of the term in a single action. At the end of this procession, a fire is lit and food and drinks are offered, followed by cigarettes. The sledge is left at the grave along with other implements such as a cooking pot, a wooden collar and a stick for whipping reindeer. The collar comes from a tamed animal slaughtered for the funeral. Just before people return home hurriedly after the burial, the fire is put out, offerings are made to different directions and a few men shout 'huya, huya', the command for tamed reindeer to gallop. Then, the spirit (pana) of the dead is believed to drive the sledge and embark upon his or her 'longjoumey' to Buni, the land of the dead. For this posthumous joumey, the relationship between the form and the function of material objects is inverted. What is apparently unusable in the living world becomes functional in the other realm. The sledge and the collar put next</page><page sequence="7">HEONIK KWON 121 to the grave are broken in half and the cooking pot has holes in it. Sometimes, miniature models of implements were also used for this purpose rather than the objects themselves (Vasilev 1929: 18). The act of breaking material objects at the burial site symbolizes a radical break between the world of the living and the afterlife. According to Pilsudskii, the Orochon conceive of this disjunction between the living and the dead as a kind of inversion of the order of things: for instance, summer in this world is winter in the world of the dead and, most importantly, people in the other world do not talk (1989: 54). Unlike the (broken) sledges which transport the dead out of this world, riding saddles are often passed on to the following generation. The Orochon saddle is a roof-shaped, ornamented object made of wood or bone and covered by reindeer hide. It is usually inherited agnatically, but sometimes from matrilateral kin. The inheritance takes place when a novice hunter is mature enough 'to travel alone in the forest', or when his patron becomes inactive in hunting. When a saddle is passed to the next generation, it has to be re-embodied by wrapping the frame in fresh hide softened and sewn by women.10 Obtaining a saddle in this way signifies the inheritance of the forebear's knowledge, which hunters call 'how to do things properly'. Hence, a hunter who took over the saddle of his mother's father often contests decisions made by his father - on the direction of migration, for example - by saying, 'Our old man [his mother's father] would not have done it that way'. Hunters whom who others claim to have no hereditary patrons often suffer from a lack of communal respect for their work. The Orochon call their saddle ama or nama and its wooden structure ama-en, terms which share the same root with the verb amajini ('to become familiar with'). The saddle is a significant marker in the daily rhythm of work and rest and of journeys to and from camp, but it is also the means of initiating the captured young reindeer in the first place. At its first saddling, each animal is castrated and given a wooden collar as well as a name and identity. From this moment, the saddle functions as a medium of the enduring relationship between the hunter and the tamed animal. This lasting relationship between the two is called amajini, which the hunters describe as the process by which the animals 'become familiar with' human smells and eventually learn to find their way back to camp on their own by following the smell of smoke. The word amajini also applies to the young novice members of the camp who learn 'how to do things properly' from the elders. Just as reindeer 'become familiar with' the human presence, so young hunters acquire knowledge of the past. When the novice hunter becomes mature, he inherits a saddle through which he will assimilate his ancestral knowledge into his own experience. Like his predecessors, he will become competent not only in the practical activity of stalking game but also in the narrative art of hunting. By means of the saddle, he will bring his ancestor's knowledge to his hunting activity, deliver more hunting stories and will eventually be able to pass on all his knowledge and stories to the next generation. He will talk in order to work, in the sense that sharing information will be crucial for his continuous engagement with the forest environment, but he will also work in order to talk since only through talk will his work be shared and remembered. In this way, the saddle is recycled from generation to generation by re- wrapping, in contrast to the sledge which is made afresh each generation."l While</page><page sequence="8">122 HEONIK KWON the sledge removes the corpse to the burial ground and then conveys the person's spirit to the land of the dead, memories of his life are retained and recycled to his descendants by means of the saddle. Dividing the post-mortem life of human beings into two paths, the saddle selects from a person's death what is to be kept and remembered, leaving on the sledge what is to decompose and be eliminated. For a hunted animal, the sledge and saddle divide it between a carcass and a collection of living accounts of hunting. These accounts, collected in the saddle, are retained by individual hunters, whereas a carcass, gathered by sledge, is surrendered to a collective network of distribution. What is omitted from this process of gathering is the actual violence of the prey's death. On the narrative trail of dorima, the saddle path, therefore, both hunters and animals transcend their mortality and death.12 Animate beings appear on this trail engaging vigorously with each other, yet leave no trace of violent predatory deaths. The sledge complements this mnemonic function of the saddle with its role of obliterating the spirits of the dead - human as well as animal - from the process of remembering. Employing the saddle and sledge as a selective aide- memoire, the Orochon hunters unfold inside their tents a culturally particular 'natural history' which registers, from the life world of humans and animals, everything but their deaths. Hunting as comparative narrative Over the past decade of hunter-gatherer studies, it has been repeatedly stressed that the 'hunting hypothesis' of human origin was 'based on conventional wisdom of man the hunter' and that it acted as 'an apologia for war' and provided 'a strong legitimation of male dominance and aggression' (Bender &amp; Morris 1988: 5, original emphasis; see also Dahlberg 1981). This 'conventional wisdom', according to Cartmill, is inseparable today from the 'discovery' ofAustralopithecus africanus in 1924 by Dart, who depicted it as the human ancestor of 'mighty hunters and skilful butchers' (Cartmill 1993: 16). According to Cartmill, Dart's 'hunting hypothesis' postulated that the most distinctive features of humankind - large brains, bipedalism tool-use and co-operative social organization - evolved when our most ancient ancestors abandoned their arboreal, vegetarian existence in favour of terrestrial, carnivorous life (Ardrey 1976; Washburn &amp; Lancaster 1968). Cartmill writes that, for Dart, Australopithecus was a heroic creature who achieved a majestic superiority in the Darwinian 'battle for life' over all the other animal species, but in doing so became a violent creature having a thirst for blood and indiscriminate killing. Since then, according to Cartmill, the question of what is human became inseparable from hunting in anthropology. Delving into the analogical relationship between hunting and warfare, Cartmill defines 'hunting as war' as a root metaphor in Western natural history. He demonstrates that Dart's killer-ape was not a 'discovery' but the projection of a historically recurrent image of the hunter as the warrior - against - nature onto an imagined Palaeolithic reality. In support of this point, he discusses at length how the hunting 'hypothesis' developed between the two world wars and was popularized during the crisis of the Cold War, making the otherwise senseless confrontation seem intelligible through a portrayal of human nature as inherently destructive.</page><page sequence="9">HEONIK KWON 123 The 'hunting hypothesis' has received substantial criticism during the last decade both from palaeoanthropology (Isaac &amp; Crader 1981; Lovejoy 1981; N. Tanner 1981) and from social anthropologists (Leacock &amp; Lee 1982). The most serious challenge has come from the shift of emphasis from hunting to the food- sharing principle in regard to foraging societies. Isaac and Crader (1981) maintained that the practice of food-sharing, rather than hunting, was the 'initial kick' for hominization. Leacock and Lee also focused on how food is shared in contemporary foraging societies and presented 'reciprocity' as the central organizational principle of these societies in that it unites egalitarian social relations with the collective ownership of the means of production (Leacock 1982; Lee 1988). Although there is no doubt that our understanding of contemporary foraging societies is greatly indebted to Leacock and Lee's seminal contribution, I consider their definition of hunting unsatisfactory since, as Ingold has pointed out, it reduces the social process of hunting to a biological notion of predation (Ingold 1980: 159-60; 1986: 252-6). Lee writes that 'the goal of hunting is to kill game to provide food' and that hunting consists of the three basic steps of preparation, chase and killing and butchering (Lee 1979: 207). Although Lee's emphasis on 'food' is understandably intended to distinguish !Kung hunting from 'killing for sport', it fails to integrate how people view their alimentary relations with other species in the definition of hunting. In this way, hunting is generalized as a mode of food-production, whereas the difference between a sports hunter and a subsistence hunter needs to be recognized elsewhere in the different distributive organizations - hierarchical and egalitarian - of the products of hunting. Bender and Morris (1988: 5) point out that the debate in the 1960s between the 'hunting' theorists and the 'food-sharing' advocates was related to the American intervention in Vietnam and was therefore more ideological than scientific. They write that the Vietnam War divided the scientific community between those who intended to explain the political violence in terms of human genesis and those who struggled to find an alternative cause. Whether it was more scientific or political, it is ironic that the emphasis on the 'food-sharing' principle, initiated as a challenge to the 'hunting hypothesis', contributed to making hunting appear more 'natural' by removing it from sociological analysis. If the hunting hypothesis is based on 'conventional wisdom', however, where does this 'wisdom' come from? Cartmill is cautious in answering this question: The hunting hypothesis was originated as a myth, concocted out of antique preconceptions and wishful thinking. But that does not prove it false. Sometimes people guess at the truth for no good reason (1993: 225). He insists that the scientist's conception of hunting as a generalized notion of human predation is itself a symbolic complex and is anchored in the analogical relationship between predatory violence and political violence. If 'man-the-hunter' as the human predator is a myth and a projection, then this 'man' inhabits a narrative convention rather than any 'real' foraging community. Landau, in her recent analysis of the texts of Darwin, Keith, Elliot Smith and Dart, makes this point clear (1991). Drawing upon Propp's morphological analysis of folklore, she writes that 'theories of human evolution are similar in narrative form, and, at the same time, very different in meaning' (1991: x). According to Landau, accounts of human evolution are</page><page sequence="10">124 HEONIK KWON transformations of a single story-line, concerning a rite of passage of heroic conquest. Dart's killer-ape is also a form of this Heroic Hunter, who, as the true human ancestor, returns to be remembered time and again through the narratives of human origins (1991: 156). Landau concludes that palaeoanthropology is a narrative science and that, as a story-teller, the palaeoanthropologist operates on one single mythological structure. According to Ingold, 'the scope of [anthropological] inquiry is ... all contained in that one elementary situation: of the hunter, and his spear' (1986:14). Here, the hunter's spear is a metonym of culture: both as culture-for, the technology unique to human beings for their conquest of nature, and as culture-of, the symbolism of humanity's place in nature. The scientific narratives of hunting locate what is uniquely human in the possession of superior predatory technology; these narratives thus function as a mnemonic device of predatory violence and 'shock us out of our collective amnesia ... into a recognition of the truth about our ancestry' (Landau 1991: 156). If the myth of 'man-the-predator' penetrates into the mind of the scientific story-teller and forces itself upon her or his narrative, the reality of being a human predator is skilfully screened out by Orochon story-tellers from their everyday narratives. If predatory violence and the violent death of human beings signify each other in Western narratives, the Orochon technology of saddle and sledge, although also connecting the two realms of death, functions to eliminate the traces of violent death from narratives of hunting. In anthropology, on the contrary, these violent events are repeatedly transformed into narrative accounts through the mnemonic device of the 'spear', an emblem of technology and culture. Both forms of narrative are selective in their representation: in the latter, the predator is mute and only carries out predatory acts, whereas the Orochon talk as if there were no predation. It is not the purpose of this article to speculate on why their narratives are different.13 It is at least clear, however, that the talkative non- predatory hunter and the silent man-the-predator cannot be reduced to the same category of 'hunter'. A comparison between the two becomes possible only if the silent predator is situated in relation to his narrative partner, the scientist. The Orochon hunters speak for themselves, whereas 'man-the-hunter' speaks only through the narrative science of anthropology. If the hunter and the spear are an elementary structure of anthropology, we must reconsider whether the spear belongs to the hunter or to the anthropologist. The Orochon hunter hunts with words. The 'hunter' in anthropology only hunts, and rarely speaks. There are occasions when Orochon hunters also hunt without words (or what they call human 'noise'), but they do so only because they intend to deceive the prey with silence, not because they are theoretically mute. If I am right in considering that the predicament in the 'conventional wisdom' of 'man-the-hunter' has arisen not only because he is 'violent' or 'man' but also because he is mute, we need to inquire into the political relationship between this silent predator and the narrator of human evolution. NOTES An early version of this article was presented in the Department of Social Anthropology at the</page><page sequence="11">HEONIK KWON 125 University of Manchester and received the comments of seminar participants. I am grateful to Paul Baxter, Jeanette Edwards, Rohan Gell, Simon Harrison and Tim Ingold for their ideas and criticisms. The data on Orochon hunting were gathered during 1989-91 with the help of Queens' College Studentship and ChadwickAwards, Cambridge. l Wild reindeer are conceptualized as having kinship with the bear, but are contrasted with ula, tamed reindeer. The people call themselves Orochon or Ulta, which have their roots in oron and ula, both of which terms mean tamed reindeer. The same people appear as Orok in some literature. Most of the people, however, now prefer the self-appellation of Orochon and refuse to be called Orok. 2 During my research, I was formally employed as a chum-rabotnik (male tent-keeper, in Russian). Tent-keeping refers to the domestic work in general, and it is usually identified with the women (chum-rabotnitsa) and the elders. I am aware that this particular fieldwork situation may have influenced my view of hunting as narrative. 3 Since the 1930s, the nomadic Orochon have been collectivized. Today, most of the women and children live a sedentary life. The Orochon population amounts to less than three hundred, and seventy per cent. of them are concentrated in one settlement. Many of the Orochon men now spend most of the year in the forest camp, whereas the women work and live on the state farm settlement, and many of them are employed in commercial souvenir-making, using reindeer skin and produce. 4 This has to be distinguished from Mauss's famous division of the Eskimo hunter's life into two spheres: the tundra and the kasim, the ceremonial winter house (1979). Mauss wrote that the Eskimo hunter remains a biological person (a non-social, merely ecological agent) in the tundra and becomes a social person by joining in the ritualized sharing of food and other goods in the ceremonial house. If the Orochon hunters refrain from speaking in the forest, it is a highly intentional act. In other words, they pretend to be merely 'biological' beings. Mauss's conceptual division between the biological and the social person is closely related to the conceptual reduction of hunting to predation. 5 The 'bodies' collected by sledge include those of trees and fish. The sledge collects trees (mo) 'killed' for firewood. However, trees already 'dead' and dry (to-o) lying on the ground are collected by hand. In much the same way with animal prey, fish are left suspended from tree branches after they are caught until they are gathered by sledge within the next few days. 6 In the past, it was often the women who drove the sledges to collect kills. The Orochon hunters say that women are less vulnerable to the dangers of collecting slain animals. It was also a common practice among the indigenous peoples in Siberia for a successful hunter to hand over the task of slaughtering and dividing the kill to someone else, especially his brother-in-law. Hamayon interprets this custom as an expression of the alliance between the wife-giver and the wife-taker and as the 'double sharing ofwomen and game between allies' (Hamayon 1990: 364-6). In the Orochon tradition, the bride was brought to the groom's residence only by sledge, and 'it was considered improper for the bride to ride on the back of a reindeer' (Levin &amp; Pltapov 1964: 764). Although the sledge plays an important role in the relationship between marriage partners, the 'double-sharing' can be either confrontational or reciprocal, depending on whether it is only a prestigious right or a dangerous task to butcher someone else's prey and, for that matter, to 'share women'. 7 Brightman rightly criticizes the way in which this aspect of hunting, the human hunter as the prey, has been previously categorized merely as religious belief (1993). Ridington (1988) and A. Tanner (1979) also argue against locating the hunter's predatory activity under the rubric of ecology and defining his other activities, including his actions as prey, as beliefs and cosmology. 8 In the past, there were also okso, small single-seater sleds, which resembled the dog sled of the neighbouring Nivkh people. These are no longer used by the Orochon. 9 Pilsudskii explains that this act protects the spirit of the dead from the evil spirits which previously fell victim to illness or accidents. It seems clear from other sources, however, that the act ultimately aims to protect the living rather than the dead, for by reducing the number of 'evil' spirits that cause 'unnatural' death, the act makes future accidents and misfortunes less likely. '0 Orochon women consider this refurbishment of riding saddles as one of the most important aspects of their needle-work. Pack-saddles (namanki), on the other hand, have exposed wood frames with no engraving on the surface. The inheritance of storage boxes for women's tanning and sewing implements follows a matrilineal principle. Thus, it may be argued that the continuity of the saddle relies on a kind of double descent of technology, and that it contradicts the agnatic descent expressed in the renewal of the sledge. This is also indicated by the fact that saddles are sometimes passed on by matrilineal descent. l l As a creative act, wood-carving in general is conceptualized as closely connected to the process of birth. 12 The idea of two afterlife paths is central to Orochon myth and ritual tradition and is often represented by the image ofpuyo, a bifurcated tree or a river divided into two tributaries. 13 Personally, I consider that the Orochon are more developed in their technology of coping with the consequence of human predation than in their technology of executing predation. Rosaldo's</page><page sequence="12">126 HEONIK KWON (1986) point about the unspoken background knowledge in narrative is also pertinent here, for one can argue that the scientific narrative of hunting keeps the composite knowledge (what every hunter knows already, such as how to slaughter animals) in perspective whilst ignoring what the hunters themselves keep in perspective in their stories.

La selle et le tra1neau: la chasse comme narratif comparatif en Sib6rie et au dell R6sume Cet article explore la technologie de chasse dans l'6conomie des Orochon en Sib6rie orientale, dans laquelle la meme espece animale, le renne, est a la fois domestiqu6e et chass6e comme proie. Je discute les moyens symboliques par lesquels les Orochon s'efforcent de bannir la violence pr6datoire de leur chasse en particulier, et plus g6n6ralement la mort de leur vie sociale. Je contraste cette chasse 'non-pr6datoire' a la conception de rapacit6 pr6dominante souvent utilis6e pour d6crire les soci6tes forageres. Cet article conclut que la chasse n'est pas une notion unitaire qui puisse se r6duire a la pr6dation, mais qu'elle incorpore les repr6sentations culturelles sp6cifiques de la pr6dation.
