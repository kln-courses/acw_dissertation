Muth and Wesley V. Jamison Abstract As we enter the new millennium, wildlife professionals, hunters, and trappers are increasingly challenged by an influential animal rights movement opposed to many of the values and behaviors associated with traditional wildlife harvest and manage- ment. We argue that the emergence of the animal rights movement is related to profound sociocultural and demographic shifts occurring within modern society. It is a product of broad macro-structural conditions that, having converged in ad- vanced industrial societies of the late twentieth century, provide fertile ground for the rapid rise and powerful influence of this philosophy. We begin by tracing the development of the philosophy of sportsmanship and the rise of the North Amer- ican conservation movement. We then discuss animal rights values within the con- text of 4 social precursors necessary for the widespread adoption of animal rights ideology: 1) an urban epistemology (or world view) disconnected from the reality of wild nature; 2) a popularized interpretation of science which, for many people, provides evidence for a belief in animal rights; 3) anthropomorphism, or the projec- tion of human traits and characteristics onto nonhuman animals; and 4) egalitarian- ism, in which the concept of rights is extended to the nonhuman animal world. Finally, we discuss the implications of the animal rights movement for the future of hunting and trapping. : Key Words animal rights movement, hunting, social values, trapping, wildlife cSonsqrvation : 0 0 | f.

Significantly, conservation profes- sionals were divided over the appropriateness of certain wildlife harvest and management activities. Although only 6% of the respondents favored outlawing the hunt- ing of upland gamebirds with dogs, 57% favored outlaw- ing hunting black bear with dogs; and anizations though approximately 46% of the respondents felt that the use of leg- ngage ln hold traps to capture furbearers should hem to re- be outlawed, 39% opposed outlawing held values the use of leghold traps (15% had no opinlon, Muth et al. 1998). quo are As the conservation profession enters a new millennium, its timely to assess the future role of hunting and trapping. Discussions concerning the future of these activities are appearing more frequently in the professional literature (e.g., Brown et al. 1987 fIeberlein 1991, Decker et al. 1993, Gilbert 2000) as well as the popular press (e.g., Baker 2000, Beauchaine 2000, Brister 2000, Reiger 2000). In this period of questioning and change, it is imperative that wildlife professionals provide leadership to American society on wildlife con- servation issues. To effectively do so, they must partici- pate vigorously in the public debate about the future of hunting and trapping. The North American Wildlife Conservation Model In the United States, the conflict between the contem- porary animal protection movement and traditional wild- life conservation that includes regulated hunting and trap- ping is rooted in the nineteenth-century origins of wild- life conservation. The concept of "the king's deer' and the English legacy of private game preserves exclusively reserved for the hunting pleasure of the nobility were incompatible with the democratic precepts of the Amer- ican Revolution. As the European tradition became transplanted to the New World, the need became manifest to '4democratize" access to wildlife harvest (Sherwood 1981). Visions of unlimited abundance of wildlife and the democratization of hunting from the preserve of the aristocracy to an activity of mass participation gave rise to predictable results (Sherwood 19817 Tober 1981). Certain wildlife species had become scarce enough that 12 of the 13 colonies had passed one kind or another of wildlife laws (Sherwood 1981). sionals are genuinely perplexed over the state of siege in which they often flnd themselves at the present time. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), the largest of the animal rights organizations, sponsors an anti-fur campaign which receives widespread publicity; anti-hunting and anti-trapping protests are occurring with increasing frequency; and animal rights activists have taken to "liberating" mink (Mustela vison) from ranches where they are raised for fur. Perhaps most disturbing to many, because it reflects the fact that anti-hunting and anti-trapping values res- onate with a broader cross-section of the American elec- torate than just extremist fringes, the animal rights move- ment has achieved several recent successes at the ballot box (Minnis 1998, Pacelle 1998). From California (where hunting mountain lion [Puma concolor] was out- lawed) to Massachusetts (where hunting black bear [Ursus americanus] over bait and with dogs was prohib- ited and the use of body-gripping and leghold traps was outlawed), animal rights activists have become increas- ingly effective in using the policy process in advancing their agenda. But public sentiment often ebbs and flows on hunting and trapping issues and the sporting fraternity has not been without its successes. Recent attempts to pass anti- hunting measures in Idaho, Michigan, and Ohio failed at the polls. Several states have passed laws against hunter harassment, and voters in North Dakota and Virginia recently approved constitutional provisions establishing the "right" to harvest fish and game. If it seems that the public is ambivalent about wildlife issues, conservation professionals appear to be conflicted</page><page sequence="3">Animal rights and the future of conservation * Muth and Jamison 843 The American conservation crusade was born in the last half of the nineteenth century in reaction to the waste, fraud, and abuse that characterized land and resource exploitation. Wildlife conservation, in particu- lar, arose out of widespread concern over the extinction of some species, such as the passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) and the heath hen (Tympanuebus cupido cupido), and the near extinction of many others, includ- ing the American bison (Bison bison), beaver (Castor canadensis), and bird species pursued by commercial hunters (Trefethen 1975, Dunlap 1988, Reiger 1986). Despite the early establishment of game laws, disregard for them was widespread and enforcement was often understaffed, lax, or nonexistent (Warren 1997). It gradu- ally became clear that laws alone were insufficient to stop the "excesses of democracy" imposed on wildlife by mass participation in wildlife harvest. What arose to restrain these excesses was a philosophy called "sportsmanship." Promulgated by social elites, including people such as George Bird Grinnell and Theodore Roosevelt, this philos- ophy, in the words of Sherwood (1981:20), "aspired to curb the harmful effects of democracy on wildlife, which were unavoidable with the population pressures new tech- nologies, and American commercialism..." that threatened many game and nongame species in the United States With the tenet of sportsmanship replacing market hunt- ing and unlimited harvest as a governing norm, political support for wildlife conservation continued to accelerate into the twentieth century. When viewed in its most com- prehensive form, wildlife conservation in the United States has been referred to as the North American Wildlife Conservation Model (S. P. Mahoney, Newfoundland and Labrador Wildlife Division, and J. F. Organ, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, unpublished report). Wildlife conservation came to include regulated use by hunters and trappers based on sportsmanship and fair chase; funding support provided through license fees, duck stamps, and excise taxes on hunting and fishing equipment; acquisition and rehabilitation of important habitat; intensive manage- ment based on professional training and scientific research; species introductioIl and restoration through stocking and trap-and-transfer programs; protection of species perceived to be in danger of becoming extinct; and enforcement of wildlife laws and regulations. For the last 100 years, wildlife conservation has served society well. It has not been perfect by any means. Well into the twentieth century, for example, it was common- place to indiscriminately kill animals (e.g., grizzly bear [Ursus arctos], wolf [Canis spp.], coyote [Canis latrans], hawks, owls) that prey on domestic livestock or game ani- mals (Dunlap 1988). In addition, wildlife management tended to focus on game species that provided benefits to the hunting and trapping public, often with little regard for the values and desires of the growing numbers of non- consumptive and animal protection stakeholder groups. Criticism offered by Pacelle (1998:44) that wildlife agen- cies emerged as "extensions of the hunting industry" that "rarely deviated from their role as service agencies for hunting, trapping, and fishing interests" reflects the views of many people who neither hunt nor trap. Despite these and other criticisms, however, it can be argued that conservationists were perhaps too successful. As a result of sound management and strong public sup- port, declining wildlife species that were once a cause of deep concern have returned, in many cases to a point of such abundance that wildlife management agencies increasingly concentrate some portion of their efforts ameliorating the conflicts among wildlife and people that range from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and black bear depredation on agricultural products to collisions between automobiles and deer or moose (Alces alces) to complaints of nuisance Canada geese (Branta canadensis), beaver, deer, and even wild turkey (Meleag- ris gallopavo) invading our suburbs. In light of the suc- cesses of wildlife conservation over the last century and the strong tradition of hunting and trapping it is ironic that the crest in public support for traditional wildlife conservation coincided with a momentous event that changed forever how Americans would view the con- sumptive use of wildlife: In 1942, Walt Disney Studios released the animated film, Bambi. The rise of the animal rights movement Animal protection values have existed in the United States at least since 1866, when Henry Bergh founded the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The humane movement gathered momentum through the Victorian era with the rise in opposition to vivisection and it percolated along throughout the early half of the twentieth century. In 1928, for example, South Carolina outlawed the use of steeljaw traps, fol- lowed in 1930 by Georgia and Massachusetts (Reiger 1978); in the 1930s and 1940s, the American Humane Society regularly sponsored competitions to invent traps that reduced pain and suffering. However, during this time, mainstream society often regarded the humane movement as a group of individuals who were overly sentimental and unrealistic. Walt Disney, Bambi, clnd the rise of anti- hunting sentiment The release of Walt Disney's film Bambi in 1942 changed things dramatically. In our view, Bambi serves as a major point of departure for the rise of the modern</page><page sequence="4">844 Wildllffie (Fociet Bulletin 2000,28(4):841-851 animal rights movement as it relates to the blood sports Rather than initiating anti-hunting sentiment, Bambi gave voice to inchoate and diffuse values residing in a midcen- tury American society characterized by a profound sense of unease and anxiety. Although not deliberately des- igned as such Bambi is perhaps the most effective piece of anti-hunting propaganda ever produced (Reiger 1980; Lutts 1992, 1996; Cartmill 1993a, b). What makes Bumbi so powerful? First, although the movie conveys an anti-hunting message very effectively, Disney was far from the first to portray hunted deer as vic- tims or deer hunters as cruel. But through a skillful mar- keting campaign and through the media of film and later television, Bambi was the first to convey an anti-hunting message to a mass audience of millions of people in the United States and around the world (Lutts 1992, Cartmill 1993b). Over the last 60 years, Bambi, along with other Disney animals, has truly become ';a part of our cultural DNA' (Ringel 1988:M1, quoted in Lutts 1992). Although Bambi is the flrst instance of an anti-hunting message that became available to the general public through the mass media, its dramatic impact is also due to a second factor. Americans who saw Bambi in the 1940s and 1950s were (perhaps unconsciously) receptive to the 2 inescapable messages of the movie. The first message is that wild nature left free of man's intrusion, is a garden of Eden where animals are seerl as innocent playmates, reposing in a state of harmony in which the lion lies down with the lamb (or, in Bambi's case, where Friend Owl, the great horned owl [Bubo virginianus), cavorts joyfully with Thumper the rabbit (Sylvilagus Sp.)? and Flower, the skunk (Mephatus mephitus)? instead of dispatching them for an easy meal). The second message is that human beings are violentf cruel, dangerous and corrupting (Cartmill 1993b). Man (as symbolized by the hunters) sets his vicious dogs on the harmless forest animals; lets a campfire get away that turns into a raging forest fire; shoots Bambi, nearly wounding him mortally; and, in the most powerful moment in the film, kills Bambis mother. The misan- thropic mood of the Ellm is captured in the foreboding response of Bambi's mother to his questions, ;What hap- pened, Mother? Why did we all run?' She ominously replies, "Man . . . was in the forest.' Human beings are seen as responsible for the fear violence, and death found in an otherwise Edenic nature. (For an extremely insightful analysis of the extent to which these themes are held by more contemporary animal rights activists see Dizard 1999.) The public reaction to Bambi demonstrated that large segments of the American public were increasingly receptive to animal protection values and an anti-hunting message. Indeed, ;'The Bambi Syndrome" is now part of our cultural lexicon. However, it wasn't until the publi- cation over 30 years later of Peter Singer's (1975) book, Animal Liberution, that an intellectual rationale was pre- sented which served to galvanize people to coalesce into institutionalized forms of social and political organization that we refer to as a mass movement. The contemporary animal rights movement Animal rights versus animal welfare. The animal pro- tection movement is an overarching term that includes people who subscribe to a philosophy of animal nghts as well as those favoring one of animal welfare (Jasper and Nelkin 1992). Animal welfarists are those who support such things as treating animals with compassion and avoiding animal cruelty. Their strategies often include reformist legislation and humane education, funding of animal shelters and animal birth control programs, and cooperation with existing agencies in program develop- ment and implementation. Animal rightists, in contrast, argue that animals have absolute moral and legal rights to personal autonomy and self-determination with equal rights across species (especially higher vertebrate species). They seek total abolition of all animal exploitation and use civil disobedience and direct action to protest the use of animals (Jasper and Nelkin 1992, Jamison 1996) Animal protection organizations concern themselves with an agenda that includes most animal-related domains, including use of animals in biomedical researchS zoos and aquariums animal entertainment (cir- cusesS dog and horse racing) the care of pets and com- panion animals all farmed animals, anything to do with the exploitation of animal parts and products (e.g., silk, wool, leather) and wildlife and fisheries management. However, advocates of animal rights often have severe disagreements with proponents of animal welfare over objectives, strategies, and tactics (see the discussion by Francione [1996], an avowed animal rights proponent, for an articulate condemnation of the animal welfare per- spective). One value position they hold frequently in common is a strong antipathy to trapping and hunting for sport and recreation. Animal welfare advocates more readily subscribe to the view that when intervention is necessary to manage a wildlife population, humane meth- ods (such as sharpshooters and nonlethal boxwage traps) should be used instead of traditional hunting and trapping by sportswomen and sportsmen. Anirnal rights activists, in contrast would disagree with the notion of human intervention at all. Because of this position, animal rights organizations often find themselves in conflict with environmental organizations such as the National Audubon Society and the Sierra Club which support the</page><page sequence="5">845 Animal rights and the future of conservation * Muth and Jamison use of lethal methods (where they view it as appropriate) to protect endangered species from predators or to main- tain biodiversity. Since 1980, animal protection organizations have grown dramatically in membership and especially fund- ing support. As reported to the Internal Revenue Service, the combined budgets of 22 animal protection organiza- tions totaled $168 million for 1998. Among the largest are The Humane Society of the United States ($36,633,759), the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ($30,127,460), and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ($25,623,669). The budget of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) increased from $10,681,269 in 1997 to $14,543,860 in 1998 (Animal Industry Foundation 2000). Along with larger budgets, the animal protection movement has grown in political sophistication and influ- ence. Movement representatives are especially skilled in using the mass media to advantage. In 1990, 1996, and 2000, to publicize a variety of animal issues, animal pro- tection organizations staged a "National March for the Animals" in Washington, D.C., that brought activists together from every state in the union and several foreign countries. Attitudes values, and demogruphics. Beginning in the 1970s, pioneering research conducted by Kellert (1978a, b) has systematically documented the emergence of anti- hunting and anti-trapping attitudes and values in Amer- ican society. More recently, research results reported by the consulting firm Responsive Management (Duda and Young 1998, Duda et al. 1998) have identified the contin- uing existence of anti-hunting and anti-trapping values among the general public in the United States. In one nationwide survey, 22% of the respondents disapproved of legal hunting and 16% either moderately or strongly disagreed with the view that hunting should continue to be legal. Trapping is rated even more unfavorably. Nationwide, only 34% of the respondents supported legal trapping and 59% disapproved of it (Duda and Young 1998). Although approximately 79% of a national sample agreed that using animals for human beneElt is acceptable as long as the animal doesn't suffer undue pain, around 15% subscribe to attitudes favorable toward animal rights - i.e., animals should not be used by humans under any circumstances. However, validating the fact that atti- tudes do not always predict behavior, it is interesting to note that while 15% of Americans purport to hold an atti- tude favoring animal rights only 3% report actually not using any animals for any purpose (Duda et al. 1998). In summarizing the results of several studies examining ani- mal issues, Duda et al. (1998:293) conclude that while ';most Americans feel animals have some rights, few believe in absolute rights for animals." Furthermore, they remind us that considerable variation exists among respondents based on demographic variables such as edu- cation, ethnicity, urban-rural residence, age, and income, and they wisely advise that it can be dangerous and mis- leading for conservation agencies and sportsmen's organ- izations to "paint all such groups with the same brush." Demographically, recent studies (Richards and Kran- nich 1991, Jamison and Lunch 1992, Jamison 1998) sug- gest that American animal rights activists tend to be female, overwhelmingly Caucasian, between the ages of 20 and 40, employed in professional occupations, and have middle-class incomes. In addition, they have achieved higher levels of education than their counter- parts in the general population, are apt to be well-educat- ed and informed about wildlife management issues, and possess the will and the ability to influence the policy process. Wildlife-related goals and objectives. The principal objectives of animal rights organizations are probably familiar to most wildlife professionals. Although animal rights activists represent a variety of perspectives and positions on individual issues and many will disagree with the generalizations presented below, we feel that the following statements represent the views of the majority of people who would classify themselves as active partic- ipants in the animal rights movement. (Readers are advised to consult Minnis [1997] for a comprehensive typology of anti-hunting beliefs.) Animal rights activists object to categorizing wild ani- mals as a "resource," because this implies something to be managed and used for human beneE1t. Rather, they feel that animals should be allowed to live their lives free of human-caused pain and suffering. Some activists believe that Native Americans forfeited their rights to hunt and trap for subsistence when they adopted high- powered rifles and steeljaw traps and when they began to sell wildlife parts and products in the commercial economy. Wenzel (1991: 5) quotes one activist protest- ing seal hunts in Canada as saying, "To me, Inuit culture is a dying one. I see my job as helping it go quickly." Animal rights activists are nearly unanimous in feeling that hunting, trapping, and (to a lesser extent) fi1shing for sport and recreation are inappropriate uses of wildlife. Activists feel that these activities should be, if not out- lawedS so heavily restricted that they will gradually dis- appear. They feel that an animal's "natural" death, whether by starvation, disease, accident, or nonhuman predation, is preferable to a death caused by bullets, traps, or fish hooks. They find especially egregious those</page><page sequence="6">846 Wildlife Society Bulletin 2000, 28(4):841-851 activities viewed as frivolous, unnecessary, or gratuitous, such as trapping for pelts, competitive fishing tourna- ments, guided ("canned") hunts, trophy hunting, catch- and-release fishingS and varmint hunting It's interesting to note that in many parts of Europe, where hunting is heavily regulated and trapping for sport is either outlawed or very restricted, wildlife conservation issues are often on the agenda of animal protection organizations. For example, Germany has outlawed catch-and-release fishing because of the pain and suffer- ing it is presumed to induce in fish. Fishing tournaments also are against the law. In England, deer hunting has been outlawed on Crown lands and protests against red fox (Vulpes vulpes) hunting are becoming increasingly violent. Although a measure to outlaw fox hunting was recently defeated in Parliament, human marathon runners are increasingly replacing foxes as the quarry pursued in traditional fox hunts. European animal rights activists are devoting more and more attention to international issues, such as stopping efforts to legalize elephant (Loxodonta africana) harvests in Africa. Although trapping furbearer species for sport and recreation is either outlawed or under severe pressure in many European countries, large numbers of animals are often taken by trapping for pest-control purposes (musk- rat [Ondatra zibethicus]7 for example, to protect the Dutch system of dikes against damage). European Union (EU) regulation 3254/91, passed in 1991, prohibited the use of leghold traps in EU member countries. It also contained a provision prohibiting imports of fur from countries that have refused to ban leghold traps or adopt internationally agreed upon humane trapping standards (Hamilton et al 1998). Representatives of animal rights organizations use a variety of methods to advance their agenda with wildlife conservation agencies. These methods include 1) chal- lenging the assumptions and biological data used to justi- fy harvests, seasons, bag limits, and other regulations; 2) reviewing agency compliance with the National Environ- mental Policy Act (and related state and federal laws) and monitoring agency implementation of guidelines estab- . . .1S ned under the Animal Welfare Act; 3) protesting use of lethal techniques in programs promoting individual (often endangered) species (e.g., opposing the use of sharpshooters to eliminate nonindigenous mountain goats [Oreamnos americanus] from Olympic National Park, which was part of an effort to protect endangered botani- cal species); 4) sponsoring protests of lawful hunts and regulated trapping, hunter-harassment campaignsS and sabotage efforts; and 5) organizing ballot measures in the form of initiatives and referenda to outlaw or restrict hunting and trapping. Four social precursors to an animal rights movement As can readily be seen, the challenge posed by the ani- mal rights movement to wildlife conservation agencies and organizations is formidable. As Decker and Brown (1987:599) have perceptively observed, "The animal rights movement is particularly disconcerting for most wildlife professionals because it opposes not only the activities that management makes possible (e.g., hunting and trapping) but also the underlying assumptions and precepts upon which the profession has been based. It questions what wildlife managers do professionally, how they do it, and why they do it. Some wildlife manage- ment professionals believe that the animal rights move- ment is one of the greatest threats to wildlife conserva- tion faced by the profession....' Many wildlife conservation professionals are mystified by the pervasive influence of the animal rights move- ment. We believe that the existence of 4 social precur- sors, or social conditions, helps to explain the persistence and widespread adoption of philosophies values, and ideologies related to animal rights. These social precur- sors are 1) an urban epistemology (or world view) dis- connected from the reality of wild nature; 2) a popular- ized interpretation of science which, for many people, provides evidence for a belief in animal rights; 3) anthro- pomorphism, or the projection of human traits and char- acteristics onto nonhuman animals; and 4) egalitarianism, in which the concept of rights is extended to the nonhu- man animal world. Urban epistemology As the United States went through the transition from an agrarian society to an industrial society, participation in agricultural and resource-extraction sectors of the economy declined while employment in the manufactur- ing and service sectors increased. One of the outgrowths of this shift was the concentration of people in cities. As people moved from farms and rural communities to cities and suburbs, they underwent a dramatic change in how they experienced nature. Vialles (1994:19), in a study that just as easily characterizes the United States, docu- ments the gradual relocation of slaughterhouses in France from the city to the countryside, where the killing was far removed from the emerging urban sensibilities that increasingly viewed animals as "lesser brethren." Rather than procuring their food directly by killing game or slaughtering farm animals, most urbanites buy meat prepackaged in shrink-wrapped Styrofoam contain- ers. In addition, their direct links to animals as wild creatures, as prey, and as sources of food have been lost. Similarly, rather than experiencing wild animals and wild</page><page sequence="7">847 Animal rights and the future of conservation * Muth and Jamison nature as "red in tooth and claw," urban dwellers experi- ence them through socially constructed filters and highly stylized settings, such as zoos, aquariums, petting zoos, public parks, and one's own backyard bird feeder. Finally, and perhaps most important, there is what some people refer to as the cult of the pet (Szasz 1968). For many urban people in modern societyS pets are in- creasingly assuming roles in human relationships that were once reserved only for other humans. Pets are in- creasingly experienced as best friends, surrogate spouses, and replacement children-friends who love us uncondi- tionally, spouses who won't divorce us, and children who don't grow up, get married, and move to some other part of the country. In Pacelle's (1998:44) view, the growth of the humane movement was accelerated by the "increas- ingly significant bond between Americans and their pets." One consideration that makes societal attitudes toward pets relevant to contemporary wildlife conservation is that people in advanced industrial societies increasingly experience wild animals as domestic, either as livestock or as housepets. Society is redeElning what is wild and what is domestic. American bison, elk (Cervus elaphus), and ostrich (Struthio camelus) among others, are now raised on ranches and farms and their meat is more com- monly available in restaurants and supermarkets. Other wild animals-ferrets (Mustela putorius), for example- are now legally available in many locations for purchase as house pets. Managing wild animals increasingly per- ceived as domestic poses problems because it violates prevailing sociocultural norms against hunting animals viewed as livestock and trapping animals kept as house pets (Muth et al. 1998). Popularized interpretations of *cience The second social precursor is the rise of science, speciE1cally the theory of evolution and the practice of evolutionary biology. This is extremely important, because for many people belief requires evidence. But we are not talking about the same science published in scientific journals. It is not our intention to disparage or discount the rigorous, carefully controlled studies of ani- mal behavior, intelligence, and emotion conducted by serious scientists. Rather, we are referring to a science that is so heavily interpreted and popularized that conser- vation professionals may not even recognize it. It is the science that has been mediated through television "docu- mentaries," news magazines, and popular books; a sci- ence that tells us that elephants weep from emotional deprivation (Masson and McCarthy 1995). The Judeo-Christian heritage asserts that Man was cre- ated in God's image and was granted dominion over all the animals. In this cosmological perspective, humans are separate from the nonhuman animal world. With the advent of the theory of evolution, the lines between humans and other animals became blurred. The theory of evolution dethroned humanity from its pnvileged sta- tus at the center of the biological world. Instead, many people in modern society have come to view humans as simply a product of random processes, processes of blind variation and genetic retention. Evolution has been interpreted as dissolving the bound- aries between humans and the nonhuman animal world (Farber 1994). After all, as evolutionary biologists tells us, humans are descended from apes and share approxi- mately 98.6% of our DNA with chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). When this scientiElc fact gets popularized, humans no longer appear to be superior to our nearest rel- atives in the animal world; we are perceived to be virtually the same. In fact, Pacelle (1998:44) acknowledges that the emerging humane movement was given added impetus by "the increasing knowledge of the emotional and physical similarities between people and animals.' Anthropomorphism Collapsing the distinctions between humans and ani- mals in this way makes the third social precursor, anthro- pomorphism, irresistible. Anthropomorphism simply means the projection of human attributes, values, and personality characteristics upon nonhuman entities. The projection of human qualities upon animals is nothing new. From jackals (Canis sp.) and cats in early Egyptian beliefs, to the raven (Corvus corax) who created the world in Tlingit Indian culture, to the Lamb of God in Christian cosmology, animals have always been vested with very powerful meanings. Throughout history, animals have often symbolized that which is gallant, noble, and beautiful in human beings. However, they also have represented a full array of negative human attributes, including the lust, danger, and deceitfulness we often see in ourselves (Campbell 1959). In reviewing the literature and art of the medieval and Victorian periods, for example, Mason (1995) con- cludes that in the past, animals often symbolized some human sexual or sensual trait, usually lust, lechery, or promiscuity, and notes that animals dominate many of the notions of feminine evil that were common in late nineteenth and early twentieth century art. But the way animals are anthropomorphized in ad- vanced industrial society today has undergone fundamental change (Lansbury 1985). As we have seen, by success- fully anthropomorphizing Bambi, Walt Disney dramati- cally changed how hunters are regarded in American society. From Bambi to Free Willy to Babe, the noble pig, animals appear not as humans imbued with frailties,</page><page sequence="8">848 Wildlife Society Bulletin 2000, 28(4):841-851 complexities and failings but as idealized, simplified ver- sions of humanity. There is nothing ambiguous about what is now projected on animals. Animals are lovingS loyalS carings sincere? and trustworthy. Indeed they are perceived by many people to be all those things that are increasingly in doubt about humanity in the modern age. Not only are animals perceived as people they are per- ceived as good people. It is little wonder that people in modern society-hav- ing experienced pets as family membersS having wit- nessed killer whales (Orcinus orca) at Sea World kissing their trainers, having read newspaper accounts of a goril- la (Gorilla sp.) saving a toddler who accidentally fell into her cage-empathize with a northern river otter (Lontra canadensis) caught in a leghold trap or oppose hunting bison as they range outside of Yellowstone National Park. So far wesve seen that animals are experienced as members of the family they are anthropomorphized as possessing human qualities, and a heavily interpreted and popularized science provides evidence that animals are truly like people. For many people this raises a question: Why don't animals deserve to be treated like people? Egaliturianism The Elnal social precursor necessary for animal rights values to take root is egalitarianism or the notion of equal rights The animal nghts movement has masterfully cap- tured one of the most potent symbols in American socie- tys the language of nghts (Wildavsky 1991). Animal rights refers to the fight to extend rightss defined as state protection of individual autonomy and self-deterrnina- tion, outward from humans to nonhuman animals (Nash 1989 Silverstein 1996)* In many respectsS modern history has been the history of the extension of rights (Nash 1989). Looking at his- torical examples from the United States-from propertied white males at the time of the American Revolution, to freeing the slaves during the Civil War, to the passage of child-labor laws, to the nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution giving women the right to vote -the moral umbrella has been expanding outward and has become more inclusive (Nash 1989). The debates continue on into the present-day conflicts over the extension of full and equal rlghts to the disabled, the mentally ill, gays and lesbians, illegal aliens, and unborn human fetuses The animal rights movement may be viewed as simply one more stage in this histary. Only now for the flrst timeS people are advocating extending the legal protection of rights to the nonhuman animal world. (For a thought-provoking critique of this perspec- tiveS see Dizard 1999.) In fact when describing the cru- elty suffering and death visited upon animals at the hands of humans, animal activists often invoke rights- laden terms such as 4'holocaust" and ;'slavery." For a dis- cussion that compares the plight of animals with human slavery, see Spiegel (1988). The animal rights movement as a moral crusade In summary, these 4 social precursors have come together to provide fertile ground for the emergence and persistent staying power of an animal rights ideology and supporting social movement marked by the passionate involvement of very committed!l true believers. The rhetoric and persistent staying power of the movement leads most people in the conservation community to believe that the animal rights movement is about animals. However, several scholars who have studied animal rights activism advance convincing arguments that this move- ment is about something more. They argue that it is less about animals than about larger issues and cross-currents being played out in modern society, of which animals are merely the symbols (Sperling 1988, Jasper and Nelkin 1992, Dizard 1999). From this l?erspective, the animal rights movement can be accurately characterized as a moral crusade, the major objectives of which are to trans- form human society and individual human beings. As our colleague, Jan Dizard (Dizard, personal com- munication), is fond of reminding us, "There is some- thing about advanced industrial society that leaves us hungry." Many people feel empty and are searching for meaning. They are disaffected and deeply dismayed with the direction in which modern society is headed. They are searching for things that make sense of their lives and give them meaning and a sense of purpose. Especially during times when society is undergoing dramatic macro- social change, many people are drawn to fundamental movements to explain and interpret the changes they are experiencing (Sperling l988). And just as some people may continue to find meaning and fillElllment in their families, in their religion, or in their passion for hunting and trapping (e.g., Miller 1992; Stange 1997; Brady 1990; Dizard, in press), others may seek it by joining militia movements, searching for extraterrestrial aliens, or in the Hale-Bopp comet and the cult of Heaven's Gate. But an increasing number of people in advanced industri- al societies are Elnding meaning and a sense of purpose in the new frontier of liberating animals (Herzog 1993; Jamison et al.5 in press). Thus, the animal rights movement is as much about modern society and its discontents as it is about animals (Franklin 1999). It is about reforming society, and ani- mals are simply the symbolic vehicles through which this reformatjLon is to be actualized (Sperling 19887 Jasper and</page><page sequence="9">Allimal rigllts alld tlle future of conservation * Mutll and Jalllison 849 Nelkin 1992). If that's true, animal rights activists will not be placated when someone invents a more humane leghold trap or markets a more accurate and lethal bow and arrow, or when agencies ban all but catch-and-release H1shing with barbless hooks. Unless we can "fi1X" what millions of people perceive to be wrong with modern society, there will continue to be people who see fighting for the cause of animals as a source of meaning and sal- vation (Sperling 1988, Jasper and Nelkin 1992). In addition to conflicting beliefs about the appropriate use and treatment of animals, animal rights activists and conservationists who support hunting and trapping also hold fundamental differences regarding what it means to be human. These are conflicts over whose vision the vision of St. Francis of Assisi, the Patron Saint of Animals, or the vision of Orion the Hunter-is going to prevail in terms of what it means to be human in the twenty-first century. In the minds of animal rights adherents, the question is: Are we going to be humans who pursue and kill animals for our own sport and personal recreation, humans who en- slave and exploit our animal brothers and sisters, or are we going to be humans who treat animals with the love and respect they deserve, such that we humans are Elnally able to lie down with the lion and the lamb? Implications of the animal rights movement for the future of hunting and trapping There can be little question that societal values and meanings regarding wildlife are dramatically changing and will continue to do so (Muth 1991). The sociocultu- ral landscape that has given rise to the animal rights movement is extremely complex; many conservation pro- fessionals and sportsmen and women Elnd the movement and its influence very bewildering. Some people are frustrated or angry over the fact that animal rights activists have achieved some measure of success in their campaigns against the traditional harvest and use of wild- life. What is the wildlife conservation community to make of this movement? How should conservation pro- fessionals respond to it? Responding to challenges posed by clnimal rights Despite some fundamental differences between animal activists and the conservation community, it will be important to guard against throwing the baby out with the bath water. Challenges posed by animal protection organizations have for.ced conservation professionals to engage in collective introspection, often stimulating them to re-examine the validity and usefulness of long-held values and beliefs. These challenges to the status quo are healthy for the conservation professions. As a result, the attitudes and values of the conservation community also are changing, allowing conservation professionals to identify and respond to changing social values and in many cases to come into closer alignment with them Perhaps among the most challenging questions raised by the animal rights movement are those that have to do with the very viability of the North American Wildlife Conservation Model itself. Is this an outmoded model or does it simply need to be revised and updated to reflect modern values and sensibilities? If it is to be rejected, what should replace it? What should be the role of hunt- ing and trapping in the future of wildlife conservation, regulated hunting and trapping by licensed sportsmen and women or hunting and trapping by agency sharpshooters and private pest-control fims? And what is more accept- able from a moral perspective, hunting and trapping that provide benefits to humans through regulated use or dis- carding into incinerators and landfills beaver carcasses trapped by pest-control Elrms? The conservation commu- nity in general and conservation professionals in particu- lar would do well to engage one another in dialogue over these and related issues. In addition to pondering these questions, the conserva- tion community needs to decide what role it should play in an era of increasing social conflict over wildlife. Is it the role of conservation professionals simply to react to changes in social values? Or should they work to help shape the course of change in social values and public policies? If a more proactive leadership role is adopted, conservationists would do well to remember the model upon which wildlife conservation was founded. Wildlife is managed for the public and by the public in such a way as to provide benefits from public uses of wildlife, whether for food, lifestyle, or culture. The benefits of use reinforce the public's self-interest to conserve wild- life and pay for wildlife conservation (Hamilton 1998). In the view of many professionals, the North Ameri- can Wildlife Conservation Model is still useful. One challenge, however, will be to broaden the wildlife policy umbrella such that it provides beneElts and is more res- ponsive to a broader array of wildlife stakeholder groups. In so doing, it will be important that conservation profes- sionals and sportsmen and women work to forge a mid- dle ground on wildlife management issues that is respon- sive to evolving public sentiments. One avenue for achieving this goal is for the conservation community to identify common ground with moderate organizations in the animal protection movement and to work together with them toward progressive accomplishments in advancing the cause of wildlife conservation.</page><page sequence="10">850 WilG/life Societ" Bulletixl 2000, 28(4):841-85 1 If, as a result of introspection and dialogue, the conser- vation community subscribes to the view that hunting and trapping should be retained as instruments of conserva- tion, wildlife professionals, hunters, trappersS and their organizations need to position themselves as mainstream conservationists. Most Americans, although they oppose cruelty to animals, also oppose granting equal rights to animals. In developing a middle ground responsive to the attitudes and values of most Americans, the conservation community will need to communicate the importance of hunting and trapping in wildlife conservation. Too often in the past, "educating the public" has either relied too strictly on the basis of science alone or has simply been a euphemism for trying to convince people to support hunt- ing arld trapping. In the future, communicating with the public must be conducted in such a way that the conser- vation message resonates with people's values. In communicating with the public, conservationists need to be responsive to changing public sensibilities. They need to be aware, for example, of the changing connota- tions of"sport" and "recreation." Organ et al. (1998) have discussed how the concept of sport has shifted from the "unalterable love of fair play" held by George Bird Grin- nell and other early conservationists to the emphasis on competition and winning at any cost typiEled by modern professional athletes. As long as conservationists continue to justify hunting and trapping based on the idea of sport, these activities will remain abhorrent to animal rights ac- tivists in particular and to a growing segment of the Ameri- can public in general, to whom hunting and trapping animals for sport, for recreation, for "fun" is anathema. The future role of traditional hunting and trapping in wildlife conservation is dependent on many factors, not the least of which is the challenge posed by the animal rights movement. If regulated hunting and trapping be- come severely restricted or eliminated as components of wildlife conservation, it is worth reflecting on the poten- tial consequences that may obtain for wildlife and for the many people who depend on them for consumptive and nonconsumptive uses. Should wildlife overabundance result in escalating conflict between wildlife and people, wildlife management may out of necessity, shift from a conservation model to a pest-management model. In our view this would be cause for grave concern. Not only would it potentially weaken the support that the Ameri- can public has traditionally invested in wildlife conserva- tion, but it would surely diminish the respect, wonder, and awe with which many people in modern society presently regard wildlife.

He received his Ph.D. from Oregon State University, where he specialized in political science and studied the animal rights move- ment in North America. Since that time, he has continued his re- search into the movement and has conducted studies in both the Unit- ed States and Europe. His specific research interest focus upon the political manifestations of contested meanings of nature, as well as urban-rural conflicts. Robert M. Muth is an associate professor in the Department of Natural Resources Conservation at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, where he specializes in the sociological and policy aspects of wildlife and fisheries conservation. He is also an associate faculty member in the Animals and Public Policy Pro- gram, Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine. He received his Ph.D. in natural resources sociology from the College of Forest Re- sources at the University of Washington in Seattle. One of his major scientific interests involves the changing roles and meanings of wild- life in advanced industrial society. Specific research interests include the study of attitudes, values, motivations, and behavior of poachers; subsistence users of wildlife and fish; animal rights activists; trappers; sport hunters and anglers; and wildlife and fisheries 9 professionals. \s\ Associate editor: Peyton Animal rigllts and the future of conservation * Mutll and Jamison 851</page></plain_text>
