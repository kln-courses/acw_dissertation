<plain_text><page sequence="1">"VIEWING" THE BODY: TOWARD A DISCOURSE OF RABBIT DEATH Julie Ann Smith Abstract Traditional academic discourse on animal death denies non-human animals an understanding of death based on an inability to have a "concept" of death. A different view has emerged within a rabbit rescue organization to which I belong called the House Rabbit Society. HRS members live closely with rabbits inside their homes and as a matter of practice place the body of a deceased rabbit with his or her surviving partner or group for "viewing." Observing rabbits in this context, HRS members grant to them the capacity to understand that a partner has under- gone a permanent and catastrophic change. This conclusion is best understood within a larger discourse of rabbits shaped by three modes of viewing rabbits while they are alive: a rationalist approach, an emotionally engaged view, and an active suspension of interpretation. Keywords : rabbit, concept of death, House Rabbit Society Introduction Traditional academic discourse denies non-human animals an under- standing of death, including an ability to recognize that an individual is dead. This is usually expressed as an inability to have a "concept" of death. Quite a different view has emerged within an organization to which I belong called the House Rabbit Society. HRS members live closely with rabbits inside their homes. Neutered and spayed, these rabbits are often paired; and they develop close bonds with each other and with us over years of living together. Thus, unfortunately, we have frequent occasion not only to be present when one of these animals dies but also to see the survivor respond to death. This is because as a matter of practice we place the body of the deceased rabbit with the surviving partner for "viewing." Also, we have ways of talking about rabbit response to death that are affected by the ways that we look at rabbits while they are alive. On the one hand, we adopt a rationalist perspective to acquire prac- tical knowledge to help us to promote their well-being. At the same time we admit to an emotionally engaged view. Finally we under- © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2005 Worldviews 9,2 184-202 Also available online - www.brill.nl</page><page sequence="2">"VIEWING" THE BODY 185 stand that when we look at rabbits, they often resist our interpreta- tion. Taken together, these modes of viewing produce a different way of talking about rabbit response to death than the traditional discourse of animal death. Similar to the paradigm for a new ground of rationality offered by Donna Haraway (1997), our views are nei- ther purely relative to adi other representations nor fixed as absolutes. Rather, they might be characterized as partial, mobile but locatable, and collective positionings. The Discourse of Animal Death As Akira Mizuta Lippit demonstrated in The Electrìc Animal , Western philosophical tradition overwhelmingly denies to animals the possi- bility that they understand death as an experience in which they participate. Described as lacking memory, imagination, or language, animals are said to be unable to make "that certain calculation toward finitude" (Lippit 2002: 36) and thus to be confined to a per- petual present that blocks awareness of death. Put another way, this view maintains that animals cannot think about "non-existence" and so even at the moment of death cannot meaningfully die: Since animals are denied the faculties of language, they remain inca- pable of reflection, which . . . carries with it an awareness of death. Undying, animals simply expire, transpire, shift their animus to other animal bodies. Of the complete absence of death among animals Bataille asserts: 'Not only do animals not have this consciousness [of death], they can't even recognize the difference between the fellow creature that is dead and the one that is alive'. (Lippit 2002: 187-188; citing Bataille 1991: 216) All philosophical accounts of death ground an understanding of it in a capacity for conceptual thinking about the self. This capacity makes possible Dasein, , or self-disclosedness, without which recogni- tion of one's own future death and the death of others is said not to be possible. Other academic disciplines privilege other concepts. Some biologists have tied an understanding of death to an under- standing of life as the workings of a bodily machine: one under- stands death if one recognizes that humans, animals, and plants are supported by a bodily function that is finite (see Slaughter, Jaakkola and Carey 1999: 91). Psychologists Barrett and Behne have proposed</page><page sequence="3">186 JULIE ANN SMITH that an understanding of death is a recognition of the cessation of intentional action (Barrett and Behne 2001: np). Philosopher Maxine Sheets-Johnstone's view of death as emergent from the experiences of the body is particularly pertinent to the House Rabbit Society view of rabbit response to death as described in this essay. In Sheets-Johnstone's view, the evolutionary history of human understanding of death depended upon close pairing(s) with others, such that they became analogues to the self. When that bod- ily inter-subjectivity, that associative pairing, was ruptured by the death of others, then the survivor came close to an understanding that he too would die. The concept of death is thus as grounded in my experience of utter likeness to the Other I once knew as it is in my experience of utter contrast to the Other here before me [as a body]. The felt similari- ties and felt differences reverberate. ... In this moment I realize that it is precisely my possibility to be There where the Other is now, but in time. It is in this moment that I grasp both my living temporality and my ultimate end. (Sheets-Johnstone 1986: 56-57) Sheets-Johnstone also depends on "concepts" to exclude animals from an understanding of death. She holds that animals may well have a sense of "no more" in the presence of a dead companion but that they cannot anticipate their own deaths. This is because they are unable to make a first, necessary distinction between the self as a physical body as such, that is, as an objectifiable thing, and as a felt or lived body. We know this because they fail to inspect, analyze, and manipulate the body to the degree that humans do: What does it mean to say that for themselves, nonhuman animals do not have physical bodies as such? It means that by and large they do not appear to themselves, nor do their fellow creatures appear to them as analyzable and manipulable bodies. In the visual spectacle of them- selves and creatures about them, what appears is not a mere physical object - an object of such and such parts, for instance . . . What appears is a certain portentous physiognomy of some kind: threatening, car- ing, playful, fearful, curious, and so on. What appears, in short, is not a material body abstractively separated or separable from a living body. (Sheets-Johnstone 1986:37) For Sheets-Johnstone, the ability to objectify the body began in hominid history with a sensory-kinetic commitment to the world as visual materiality apart from felt experience. Once our hominid ances- tors looked at their own bodies in this way, they moved to separate</page><page sequence="4">"VIEWING" THE BODY 187 the physical body from the lived body: "the visual body in time came to be seen as an outsider, a thing out there ..." (Sheets- Johnstone 1986: 44). In and of itself, this was not enough to lead early humans to conceive of death. The next stage entailed experi- encing the "queerness" of the visual forms of others having become non-moving forms, identical but not identical to what they were before (48). Again, this strangeness was necessary but not sufficient. The final stage was for early hominids to realize that like others, they too would change radically and become a mere visual body rather than an enfolded visual-experiential body (49). Those of us with one foot in academia and one in animal wel- fare and animal rights are likely to applaud a recent observation by Jonathan Burt: "[T]he denial of animal death as opposed to other categories which animals would also lack through the absence of lan- guage [life even) is in effect a philosophical conceit that only applies within a very specific language game" (Burt 2003: 381). Indeed, alter- native academic discourse has provided or might provide powerful criticisms of the seminal philosophical tradition that denies animal death. One thinks of Foucaultian analyses of discourse as social acts sustaining power hierarchies; of recent philosophical challenges to the assumption that thinking requires language; and the acceptance of cognitive ethology as an academic discipline, which authorizes the investigation of animal behavior in terms of mental states. But my purpose here is not to criticise the philosophical tradition, which those in philosophy can do far better than I, but to describe as best I can a non-academic discourse in which I have participated, a com- munal one resulting from long and close relationship with members of a particular species: rabbits. In what follows, I do not speak for the House Rabbit Society nor any of its members. Rather, I try to give my sense of the great virtues of its discourse as an alternative or supplement to the explanatory systems I have encountered in academia. HRS Discourse of Rabbit Death: the Rationalist/ Welfarist View The House Rabbit Society (HRS) was founded in 1988 as a rabbit rescue organization by Marinell Harriman and others, and to date it has about 8,000 members, mostly in the United States. Those of us who have rescued and fostered rabbits as part of the goals of the</page><page sequence="5">188 JULIE ANN SMITH HRS have lived closely with hundreds of rabbits in our homes over the years. Members of the HRS communicate with each other through a national newsletter, individual chapter newsletters, several on-line discussion groups, and private conversations. This constitutes what I call its "discourse." Our way of talking about rabbits is shaped by the goals of the Society, which are to rescue rabbits from death at ani- mal shelters, find good, permanent homes for them, and educate the public about the best ways to make rabbits safe, healthy, and happy. As for the goal of rabbit happiness, HRS methods for determin- ing this are related to rabbit behavior. We measure happiness (apart from health) in practical terms by what we know about rabbit social behavior in more natural settings than our own homes, by observ- ing activities that rabbits themselves initiate, and by the expressive- ness of their bodies, interpreted in a simple, practical lexicon of body language. I have elsewhere tried to describe the way that our desire for rabbit happiness has shaped our living arrangements (Smith 2003). I have explained that our idea of rabbit happiness does not address the big questions, for example, rabbit consciousness. It is, instead, limited to specific ones, such as, "Does that sitting posture mean that the rabbit is relaxed or afraid; hurting or comfortable?" This way of looking at rabbits, which is governed by our sense of evidence and logic, affects the way that HRS members see rab- bits responding to the bodies of deceased partners. For one thing, they look at the interaction attentively, in the sense of "What is the survivor doing? Is he distressed, and might I help in some way?" The result is a large group of human observers who are emotion- ally involved but not particularly invested in any one way of inter- preting rabbit response to death. How rabbits behave would never affect the members' commitment to these animals, and many of us probably would be relieved if the death of a partner seemed not to matter to the survivor. Thus, the discourse of rabbit response to death is often simply a careful description of what surviving rabbits do. What rabbits are seen to do when ą partner dies is understood within the context of how rabbits live with each other. Some HRS members have small groups of rabbits, some a large herd. Many have, as I do, individual couples housed separately, again, within the home. Whatever the arrangement, the single, overwhelming fact about rabbits is their physical closeness to each other: they sit pressed together, they groom each other for hours a day, they often eat cheek to cheek. At the same time, not every rabbit gets along with</page><page sequence="6">"VIEWING" THE BODY 189 any other rabbit. Having done rabbit matchmaking for years, that is, found compatible partners for rabbits by introducing them to available singles at the animal shelter, I can say that finding a match very often requires a pool of about five candidates. And even then the rabbits may take weeks to bond. Thus, the three simple facts about rabbits that most affect the way we look at their responses to death are the closeness of rabbit bonds, rabbit social selectivity, and their individuality, that is, the differences in the ways that individ- ual rabbits behave. These rudimentary observations, the result of thousands of people looking and talking about rabbits for years, form the rationalist basis for our understanding of their responses to death. And our conclusions are that rabbits will usually investigate a body, that they recognize a former mate in the body, and that they understand that the individual has undergone a catastrophic and permanent change. Observers overwhelmingly record that most rabbits inspect the body of a recently-deceased companion. When Dairy Queen died a few years ago, all of her friends reacted differently to her body. While some rabbits cautiously came by and smelled her, most of her closest friends did more than that. They seemed to take turns lying nestled against her, and, in some cases, directly on top of her. Baby, her only female friend, dug at her body and then mounted her. Most heart wrenching of all was the behav- ior of her newest friend, Wormguy, who had never had any real friends before Dairy Queen allowed him to join her clique. Wormguy stayed as close to her body as he possibly could and refused to leave her side. (Davis and DeMello 2003: 108). The above description refers to a clique of rabbits within a large group maintained by Margo DeMello, Executive Director of the HRS. I recently asked HRS members who lived with bonded pairs to describe recent memories of a survivor's response to the body of a deceased partner. Here are some excerpts: We put his body near her after his death. She groomed him for a while and lay down beside him. (Lowis 2002: np) Benjamin sniffed the body briefly then hopped away and began groom- ing himself. (Kirkland 2002: np) Whispers stayed away for about an hour and then approached, nudged her gently and just sat beside her. (Widolf 2002: np) Phoebe came up. It seemed to me that she stopped a few feet and then stretched her head forward and looked and then started dancing around and ran in the condo and started drinking. (Long 2002: np)</page><page sequence="7">190 JULIE ANN SMITH All of the rabbits engaged in some sort of assessment of the body. Furthermore, they clearly recognized their former partner in the body, although at different stages of the investigation. We know this because the survivors treated the bodies as the individuals they knew when alive. Rabbits who are alive lie next to their partners and groom them. Rabbits rarely groom strangers, and then only tenta- tively. Therefore, if a rabbit grooms and (or) lies beside his partner's dead body in the manner that he did when she was alive, as many do, we conclude that he recognizes her in the body. We also believe that most rabbits come eventually to understand that their partners are dead. Again, this comes from years of watching rabbits interact while alive. Rabbits demand responses from each other and have a variety of ways to impose them: shoving their noses under their part- ner's chin, digging on him, mounting him, nipping him, and so on. Therefore, a rabbit who tries over time to get a response from a partner and fails, and who eventually gives up trying and withdraws, most likely understands that something drastic has occurred. Addi- tionally, the feel of a dead body to a surviving rabbit, who has been so intimate with the body while eilive, must be different than that of a live one. It will be increasingly cold, stiff, and motionless in contrast to the warm, supple, breathing body the survivor has known for years. In sum, as one member recently stated the case, "if they are smart enough to recognize individual live rabbits, I think it's an easier jump from alive to dead than from this particular brown bunny to that particular brown bunny" (Long 2002: np). Observation over time is thus at the heart of the rationalist side of our discourse about rabbit death. So is its communal nature. Contrasting observations are absorbed into a larger single text and explained as differences between individual rabbits or human styles of expression. The discourse is very democratic: claims about rabbit behavior can live on without active refutation or defense. As more people have similar observations, those accounts find a more secure place. Some observations simply fade away. Several years ago, one chapter manager appointed a secular pastor to "channel" to dead rabbits. One HRS member wrote for the HRS Journal that her rab- bit seemed content with a toy rabbit as a substitute for his deceased partner, suggesting that he did not know the difference. In spite of the authority of these individuals within the Society, their observa- tions have not found a secure place in its discourse of rabbit death. The point is that nothing need be proved or disproved at the point</page><page sequence="8">"VIEWING" THE BODY 191 of utterance. The result is a discourse that is rational in a different way than a discourse of immediate consistency. It is a world of shared suggestiveness where reiteration, emerging from a collective idea of evidence and reasonableness, slowly shapes its permanent fea- tures. This is exactly the way in which "recognition of the body" and "comprehension of the difference between dead and alive" have found a place in the HRS discourse of rabbit death. HRS Discourse of Rabbit Death: The Emotional View I have emphasized the rational, objectivist aspect of HRS discussions of rabbit death and now will mention two more influences. The sec- ond is a deep emotional connection to rabbits. In everything we say verbally or in print, the foundational assumption is that rabbits deeply matter. Why they matter is rarely discussed, except that we say that rabbits are individuals who are intelligent and highly responsive to other beings. Beyond this, I must speak only of my own emotional life with rabbits to explain part of the mechanism of their value. Central to their mattering is my identification with them: my sense of myself is bound up with them. Identification is said to taint objective knowledge. It is thought to entail emptying the other of his own nature, reducing him to a recep- tacle for one's own projections. With respect to animals, it is typi- cally viewed as extreme anthropomorphism, by which the animal not only disappears but perversely becomes more valued because it exists as a version of the human self: "If a pet owner frequently interprets the animal's species-typical behavior as human behavior, the owner will be more likely to view the animals as 'human-like' and thus form a stronger attachment to it" (Estep and Hetts 1992: 23). I would argue that identification does not collapse the other. Rather, it is what Ralph Acampora has called "symphysis," that is, "the felt sense of sharing with somebody else ... a live nexus as experienced in a somatic setting of direct or systemic (interrela- tionship" (Acampora 1995: 27). More than imagining attitudes or feelings of others (empathizing), identification sees others as partners in important responses and experiences. The alternative to identification is detachment. A recent collec- tion of stories about humans who live closely with animals provides an exemplary model. In Hannah Tinti's Animal Crackers (2004), animals</page><page sequence="9">192 JULIE ANN SMITH are backdrops to the lives of damaged people and often their vic- tims. "Slim's Last Ride" is about a young boy who is given a rab- bit by an absentee father. The boy slowly mutilates the rabbit, cutting off one limb and then another, eventually throwing it out the win- dow (the last ride). The mother routinely administers to the wounds and pain of the rabbit with each assault. However, her identification lies entirely with her son. She recognizes that the rabbit suffers but does not identify with it. Without this, she does not process the rab- bit's sufferings as important to her; otherwise she would have removed the rabbit from the boy, to say the least. Thus, whatever the dis- tortion produced by identification, it seems to me no more com- promising to objectivist knowledge than the distortion produced by a detachment from the lived experiences of others. My identification with rabbits no doubt affects my witnessing of rabbit response to death, which I have done about eight times. How I have come to assess such occasions is as a dynamic between my projections of my own concerns and their ability to check these dis- placements by generating unanticipated and unwanted responses. In fact, their actions often defeat my intellectual intentions, as I will try to suggest in the anecdote below. Recently I planned to photograph one of my rabbits named Arlo as he responded to the body of his longtime partner, Hattie. I intended to do this because I had been frustrated by the pervasive cultural denial of animal death, its implication that animals have no investment in their own and others' deaths. Arlo and Hattie had lived together for many years, including the last year of Hattie's life when she was paralyzed in her back legs from encephalitozoon cuniculi. Because Hattie seemed to find the necessary nursing activities increas- ingly painful and because her strength was deteriorating, I knew that soon she would have to be euthanized. I intended to take a series of photographs that would establish a narrative of Arlo's investiga- tion, interaction, and then permanent withdrawal from Hattie's body. When the time came, the veterinarian arrived at my house to euth- anize her. He anesthetized her before he gave the last injection, as is usual. She began tooth-purring, a light clicking of the teeth that expresses contentment. I have been with many rabbits who were euthanized, but I had not heard this sound before in this circum- stance. This is because at my clinic rabbits are first anesthetized by being masked down. Hattie's purring felt like a tremendous gift from her to me, in that it seemed to affirm my decision to take her life</page><page sequence="10">"VIEWING" THE BODY 193 at that time. This is because I interpreted it as a relief from pain made possible only by the anesthesia. Later, however, I learned that many rabbits tooth-purr under anesthesia. And thus from the out- set my rationalist project was compromised by a personal, publicly insignificant, emotional projection. After the veterinarian euthanized Hattie and pronounced her dead, he left; and I returned Hattie's body to Ario. He alternately engaged with and withdrew from Hattie's body over a two-hour period. He groomed her face, nudged her with his head, and stretched out by her. Fig. 1 . Arlo (black rabbit) with the body of Hattie . H RS Sanctuary; Edgerton, Wisconsin. Author's photograph. At times he stood off or settled down by himself at a remove. From this action I could not create a straight-line narrative ending in the conclusion I had hoped for. The behavior became too com- plicated and slow for me to impose a pattern on it. Also, after an hour of watching and photographing him, I became alarmed because / was not sure whether or not Hattie was dead. Gut movement in the body continued much longer than I expected, and rigor mortis did not occur as soon as I had anticipated. During euthanasia at my clinic, the veterinarian pronounces the rabbit dead immediately after the injection which stops the heart. That authoritative decla- ration now seems to me a convention of medical culture. I was afraid that Hattie might still be alive in some sense that I did not quite grasp, in spite of all of my experience with animal death. Later I</page><page sequence="11">194 JULIE ANN SMITH was struck by the irony that I had taken photographs to demon- strate that Arlo understood that Hattie was dead, yet I myself was uncertain about whether or not she was dead. Finally I became emotionally unable to observe any longer. This occurred when Arlo stretched out full-length by Hattie's body. The gesture upset me, partly because it has always seemed to me the most intimate of rabbit postures - the one that conveys security and surrender in a species so often on the alert. Also, Arlo did this only after he had tried to rouse the body, after seeming to know some- thing of "here but not here." As I watched, I became disturbed by my inability to protect Arlo from his loss. Also, I became ashamed. This had nothing to do with invading Arlo's privacy or exploiting him through photography or doubting the necessity of Hattie's euthanasia. It had to do with his ability to exist so fully in a non- objectifying relation to Hattie while I stood there viewing them both from the distance of concepts summoned to control the uncontrol- lable. I was the one "viewing" the body, while he seemed present to it, to the unnegotiable moment of death and loss. I realize I have read meanings into this scene related to my own problems with power and control. But Arlo was not entirely a passive recipient of my projections; he was an agent who created emotional responses in me that I did not anticipate nor want. H RS Discourse of Rabbit Death: Defening Interpretation A third premise informs HRS discourse about rabbits, including the discourse of rabbit death. This is that rabbits do not lend themselves to easy interpretation. Rather, they frustrate intellectual mastery, destabilize human confidence in the ability to speak authoritatively about them. We recognize that their bodies - for example, their ways of seeing - put limits on our abilities to know them. Figure 2 shows a foster rabbit trying to mount my cat Thimble. When I photographed them, Thimble looked at me; and her direct view made me feel her recognition. My sense of her and myself was reinforced through a mutual gaze. The rabbit also looked at me, but because of his kind of vision, he seemed less aware of me, less able to know me as a "self". He looked the way he did because rabbits have an enormous field of farsighted vision. With eyes placed high and to the sides of the skull, they can see nearly 360 degrees</page><page sequence="12">"VIEWING" THE BODY 195 Fig. 2. Cat and rabbit boking at photographer. HRS Foster Home ; Madison , Wisconsin. Author's photograph. around the head. But they see poorly up close and have a blind spot right in front of their noses. When a rabbit looks at me side- ways, he is actually looking at me as direcdy as he can, given his kind of vision (Krempels 1998: 4); and even then, the view is grainy. A photograph taken by HRS Educator Amy Espie (figure 3) beau- tifully captures how disorienting rabbit vision can be to a human. The young man in the picture obviously stares at the rabbit. But less obviously the rabbit looks intently at him. No matter how much I know about rabbit vision and how many times I look at the pic- ture, the rabbit does not appear to look at the young man unless I studiously reorient my view. Rabbits' vision can thus encourage a sense of being more aware and more "real" than they are. However, if I mindlessly walk into a room carrying a large box, the rabbits scramble for cover because the box has changed my outline and manner of movement, to which they are exquisitely sensitive. We thus live together with whole sets of conditions for "awareness" that are barely noticeable to the other, as well as ones that we share, often through mutual education.</page><page sequence="13">196 JULIE ANN SMITH Fig. 3. Man and rabbit looking at each other. HRS Foster Home ; Oakland , California. Photograph by Amy Espie. I might further convey how rabbit vision can destabilize the human mind by explaining how hard it is to determine what rabbits see in a mirror image. In my previous house, the playroom happened to have a full-length mirror, and for years I watched rabbits watch what was in it. When they see something in a mirror, many rabbits will look at it from the side, as rabbits do when they want to see something up close as best they can (figure 4). Some may touch the image with their noses, as they do when they meet another rabbit. From these behaviors I cannot tell what they want to know about the mirror image and what conclusions they reach. Their activity cannot be explained as an attempt to identify friend or foe: rabbits do not nose-touch predators. Nor does it seem likely that they see in the image another rabbit, since they do not usually behave so passively toward rabbit strangers. Also, I do not see how the "mir- ror test", thought by some academics to determine whether or not an animal has a "sense of self", can tell us much about rabbits. A</page><page sequence="14">"VIEWING" THE BODY 197 Fig. 4. Rabbit looking in mirror . H RS Foster Home; Madison , Wisconsin. Author's photograph.</page><page sequence="15">198 JULIE ANN SMITH rabbit may not be interested in a mirror image for long because he cannot see details up close. Or he may not be very interested because he is more drawn to other rabbits, who can provide bodily plea- sures that a mirror image cannot. Indeed he may not be interested because he only understands himself as a body in close and fluctuating relationship to other bodies. Figure 5 suggests this possibility. It con- Fig. 5. Clique of rabbits. H RS Sanctuary; Redmond , Washington. Author's photograph. veys how rabbits living in close relation might experience the com- munal rabbit body: the single eyes of several rabbits, grouped to each side of any one rabbit, draw him into the collective body. Finally, he may not be interested in the mirror image because he cannot fathom that a cold, hard image incapable of independent response is in any way related either to himself or another being. I once did an experiment with a rabbit named Rose that comi-</page><page sequence="16">"VIEWING" THE BODY 199 cally demonstrated the differences in our orientations. Rose often sat next to me while I worked at the computer, and I would bend over to stroke her ears. One day I decided to test Rose to see which part of my body she thought of as "me." For the first time in her pres- ence, I laid myself out on the floor. I thought she would sit by me somewhere. I hoped that she would sit by my head, proving that she knew where "I" really was. As all rabbits will, Rose took the configuration of this new impediment on the floor, mapping out my body in relation to the furniture and passages of escape. She then identified one of my hands and started biting me. What was impor- tant to her was the pleasure of our interactions, and she adeptly found the instrument of our relationship and implemented a strat- egy for activating it. Again, I was forced to shift my paradigms. Incorrigible, however, I wondered whether she would not have had to have a concept of "hand" to find mine in this new relation to my body. In HRS discourse on rabbit response to death, we surrender much interpretive authority. We know that differences between rabbit bod- ies and ours, their bodies' ways of engaging the world and ours, can frustrate explanation; and this indeterminacy leads to restraint. The result is profound joy at witnessing behaviors seldom seen by oth- ers, even as we recognize that we cannot fully account for them at this time. The "funeral dance" is a case in point. In Carolyn Long's reference to her rabbit's funeral dance, she represented its meanings as anything but transparent. I don't remember exactly, but I know Phoebe came up, it seems to me that she stopped a few feet away and then stretched her head for- ward and looked and then started dancing around and ran in the condo and started drinking. Dancing vertical leapings in the air and gyrating her body. And I was kind of put off by her behavior, like "yea I'm the only one left for a fuss, more food for me." But later I heard that other rabbits do that, some kind of litde dance ... I had never thought for sure that she was happy to be the only one around, because she always had enough of everything. She had been the one who was always sick. I thought that her response does not make sense relative to human knowledge. . . . (Long 2002: np) The human interpreter sees the rabbit funeral dance as a specific and dramatic response to death but accepts that she is shut out from its meaning in human terms, at least for now. Her response is to accept that humans are often deprived of rabbit meaning. This is evident as well in the following account:</page><page sequence="17">200 JULIE ANN SMITH A phenomenon that I've often observed is a temporary outburst of energy experienced by the supporting/ surviving rabbit at the death of his companion. Sometimes they leap and dance. At first I was a lit- tle horrified, interpreting what I was seeing in human terms ... I try to explain this behavior as some kind of sudden "vibration" in the air. Or I think to myself, maybe the bunnies know something that we don't know. (Harriman 1990: 5) Indeterminancy, the playful deferral of meaning, acknowledges that rabbit nature can frustrate easy human intellectual access. As I think about Arlo lying next to the body of Hattie, I recog- nize that I can never know whether he expected to come to a sim- ilar end. But I think that I know something of what is required to deny him any sense of this future. I would have to see him as unable to apply his experiences to himself. Hattie was Arlo's second part- ner, and he thus experienced the loss of two companions with whom he was inseparable. When Hattie was euthanized, Arlo was ill from an undetected ear infection; he died six months later. To deny him any sense of death at the time he lost Hattie is to deny him a sense of his aging and ill body. Thus, I would have to see him as a crea- ture who spent much of his life making exquisite distinctions among environmental data, yet one who pulled a blank on the critical dis- tinction at the center of existence. Is it not arrogant of me to assume that he had no more insight into his inevitable future than a six- month old juvenile rabbit, so obviously and comically clueless about nearly everything? These observations lead me to caution. This restraint seems to me preferable to the certainty of so much acad- emic discourse about animals and death. I found in Maxine Sheets- Johnstone's discussion much that reminded me of rabbits. Her view that an understanding of death emerges from the experience of loss within close associative pairing seemed so pertinent to the ways I have seen surviving rabbits respond to the bodies of long-time part- ners. Thus I am perplexed by her need to draw the line with so much confidence between humans and animals, or, more impor- tantly, to erase the possibility that animals may understand their own experiences in their own ways. HRS discourse about rabbits, including rabbit response to death, offers a different way to gather and frame knowledges about ani- mals. It leaves behind discursive arrogance, does not require perfect and impossible distance, does not collapse all species' bodies into a</page><page sequence="18">"VIEWING" THE BODY 201 single "animal" body of unspecified age, resists decontextualizing responses to death from ways of being alive in the world, embraces rather than rejects non-specialist, communal observations, and acknowl- edges that translating behavior into language can be difficult and distorting.
