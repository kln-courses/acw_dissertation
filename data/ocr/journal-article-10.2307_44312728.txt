<plain_text><page sequence="1">Literature and Religion at Rome: Cultures , Contexts, and Beliefs . By Denis Feeney. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. ISBN 0-521- 55104-8. Pp. xii + 161. $54.95. In the artful descants of De Natura Deorum , Cicero has the Peripatetic Cotta begin his response to the Stoic Balbus by insisting upon a fine distinction. "The belief that there are gods could never be pounded out of me," says Cotta, "but you teach me only the very belief of whose truth I am already persuaded by the authority of our ancestors, and nothing about why I should believe" (3.3.7). Balbus never really understands the criticism, and one can sympathize. Though his analytical finesse seems inferior to Cotta's, is Cotta himself not creating a false distinction? If a belief is wholly irrational, then why cling to it because of its long pedigree? Or if it is sound (even productively irrational), then why lay its foundation upon word of mouth rather than upon the bedrock of human consciousness? With a polite bow to Michel Foucault (15), Denis Feeney pleads for room to interpret such perplexing exchanges. He stresses that "meaning is produced by dialogue, at every level, and the search for a single, monolithic meaning- system can only proceed at the expense of smothering this ubiquitous dialogic activity" (21). The ancient Romans, he maintains, enjoyed a complicated and dynamic relation to the divine largely because and not in spite of their having borrowed so much from Greece. Since the eighteenth century Westerners have viewed Roman civilization as crude, unoriginal, and dilettante, while the Greeks are natural, authentic, and fully deserving of Lacanian psychoanalyses like Norman Austen's Meaning and Being in Myth (1990). The sixth volume in the Roman Literature and Its Contexts series, this is a fluidly written little book, the more readable for not being congested with foot- notes. Yet be warned that it addresses the broad issue of Roman literature's alleged artifice, especially in religious matters, rather than specific literary texts. The succinct central chapters framed by a short introduction and epi- logue - "Belief," "Myth," "Divinity," and "Ritual" - are designed to achieve the necessary breadth of exposure. A few tightly compressed textual analyses will nevertheless fascinate any thoughtful reader: e.g., that of the proem to Lucretius's De Rerum Natura (43-44), of a Vergilian simile (92-93), of Catullus 68 (107), and of Horace's Carmina 1.12 (111-13). Oddly, two of the three sus- tained literary analyses are more tendentious. Both involve Ovid (Horace's carmen saeculare draws the other long look [32-38]). Neither the "new univer-</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 523 sal set of criteria for human behaviour" (i.e., sexual drives) that Feeney finds implicit in the Metamorphoses (70-74) nor the "massively over-determined sensation of originary power, linked with the random and contingent" (i.e., hoary myths warmed with chattiness), that he finds cannily worked into the Fasti (127-33) sounds much like a formula for facetious humor - and what is Ovid without his urbane smirk? Unhappily, few of these texts are taught in translation, even to advanced students. For most English teachers the book must remain an enigmatic buoy marking a tiny Charybdis in classical studies. Those who are trained classicists must applaud Feeney's daring to decry the Jekyll-and-Hyde paradigms of that still highly Victorian discipline. As an en- thusiastic Vergilian, I welcome Feeney's most sensible defense of Roman inge- nuity. 1 harbor a single reservation that suggests, I think, how the book might be tied into the special interests of Christianity and Literature's readers. Recall the debate between Cicero's Balbus and Cotta: while their discussion sometimes mixes apples and oranges (or teleology and aesthetics), are they not struggling to surmount such confusion, and is that not the very cause of their friendly dispute? Feeney assumes (as when he cites anthropologists M. L. Pratt and Michael Taussig) that bouncing unintegrated ideas off of one another is crucial to the identity of any society evolving in a "contact zone" like that "be- tween the competing cultures of central and southern Italy" (67). At the same time, however, this game is a power play: "The Romans are taking over from the Greeks, inserting themselves into the ancient Greek military and cultural role of defenders of civilization against the barbarian" (55). Deconstruction seems to meet New Historicism here. The vital banter through which the present renegotiates the past (and which even oral cultures practice, through the self-deceptive updating dubbed "homeostasis" by Jack Goody) implies that meaning is ever in flight - but ambitious politicos, for good measure, are ex- ploiting the process to hijack holy relics and shore up their regimes. Is the impugning of motives really necessary, and does it not feed upon it- self beyond a point? If the dynamism of Roman culture had specific ends, then how can Feeney compare it throughout the book to Japan's perennial melding of ways and manners? When does a contact zone become an independent culture? Was Greece ever not a contact zone between Europe and Asia? To be sure, Feeney is rebutting a scholarly heritage of formidable inertia. His brilliantly volatile Rome is a welcome relief from the land of pragmatic, militaristic dead souls that, like Vergil's, blow with the dry weightlessness of leaves. There lurks in this study, however, a Gibbonesque sense that Christian- ity will snuff out the brilliance - an antithesis surely as unfair as that which humbles Rome before Greece. It is precisely the Christian perspective that best captures the Angst of Rome's eclectic hunger - that clarifies, for instance, the terrific tension between divinity as natural accident and as personified moral excellence. By consigning Christianity to the past's heap of presumptuous orthodoxies, Feeney blinds himself to any hint of culturally transcendent as- piration. Faced with "anthropomorphic, personalised gods" like Pax and Virtus , he celebrates confusion rather than seeking coherence. He sees in such figures only "specialised ways of conceptualising and harnessing the power of divinity that was available to state, group, individual, and artist" (92). Well, yes . . . but why (if I may echo Cotta) was the power being harnessed? Just for votes, prestige, and patronage? Moral paradoxes deeply embedded in human exist- ence are bubbling near the surface here, and ancient Rome's willingness to immerse its hands in the brew goes far to explain why early Christianity pros- pered throughout the Mediterranean world.</page><page sequence="3">524 Book Reviews Of course, nascent Christian doctrine was itself in need of painstaking elaboration. One wonders whether the project could have been completed in the oppressive traditionalism of the Near East or the inept sophistry sweeping across Hellenistic Greece. Yet the few passing references Feeney makes to his- torical Christianity accept a quasi-televangelist parody of it as "monolithic in its truth-claims and totalising in its social ambitions" (75). The medieval Church was constantly bursting under the strain of rival beliefs; whatever in- tolerance one finds there was largely a measure of how hard pagan customs died. The adaptations of Vergil, Lucan, and Statius into medieval Irish, for instance, while closer to vernacular translations of Roman epic than anything before the Renaissance, not only preserved scenes of divination, necromancy, the occult, and the macabre wherever feasible but also often embellished them luridly. Such matter should have been opprobrious to Irish monks from a rig- idly doctrinaire perspective. Their trespass could not have been mere self- contradiction without cognitive dissonance ('"brain balkanization,"' to use Feeney 's borrowed phrase [14 if.]): the heathen tone is flagrant. Maybe they were detailing the horrors of a life without God; or just maybe, primed by their own robustly heathen tradition, they were having a good time. Maybe they knew that a good yarn is just a good yarn. Is anyone not self-contradictory on the subject of religion - especially any storyteller, whose anxiety about sublunary concerns is unbecoming of a saint? Why make an issue of Augustan inconsistencies? Because generations of clas- sicists, in the absence of written records, have concluded that Homeric Greeks had harmonized their pantheon? The further we penetrate into historical Greece, the better we see this for the Romantic illusion that Feeney calls it. Alexander manipulated religion all the time. He was reported to have imitated the mythic triumphal procession of Dionysus through Carmania; and Arrian, though dismissing the report, treats it as quite credible (Anabasis 6.28.1-4). Of course, Alexander is "late." Feeney views Hellenistic matter as resembling Rome's in having "its own sense of distance from a pre-existing and codified body of classical mythological texts" (70). Why draw this distinction, however, when it rests largely upon our ignorance of pre-Hellenistic literature? Does Feeney really believe that Euripides invented the filicidal Medea tale (59) or Hesiod large chunks of the Theogony (65)? Is this not just substituting the "es- sentialism" of individual authorship for that of primitive ritual? I wonder if we haven't altogether underestimated the complexity of protoliterate societies, cultures where both the spoken and the written word reign. A young Albert Lord once opined that such an intermediate stage could not endure more than a generation: he soon recanted. In fact, starting with Homer, all of what we call Western literature is obviously somewhat "literate" right up to the Enlightenment, when it becomes overwhelmingly so. The life and teachings of Christ, especially, seethe with paradoxes involving the liter- ate mind's reassessment of oral tradition. The Greco-Roman world before Christ was scarcely immune to such fertile tensions. Feeney credits the Romans with "creating a national literature on the vernacular model of another national literature" (53) and thereby inventing European belles lettres. Is he not observ- ing, rather, the uneasy veneration of the past, seasoned with deliberate revision and lively parody, that characterizes an ethos of writing privately for public recital?
