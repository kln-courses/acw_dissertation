<plain_text><page sequence="1">LAW AND ETHICS IN THE TRADE AND ENVIRONMENT DEBATE: TUNA, DOLPHINS AND TURTLES Ilona Cheyne* If we wish to live in the light of reason, we must follow rules or principles; for that is what being rational is. When these rules or principles conflict in concrete cases, to be rational is to follow the course of conduct which least obstructs the general pattern of life in which we believe. The right policy cannot be arrived at in a mechan- ical or deductive fashion: there are no hard-and-fast rules to guide us; conditions are often unclear, and principles incapable of being fully analysed or articulated. We seek to adjust the unadjustable, we do the best we can.1 l. Introduction No one has more clearly expressed the dilemma of making ethical choices in the real world than Isaiah Berlin.2 Private individuals, policy-makers, and interest groups all have views on how conflicts should be resolved, but applying those views coherently and consistently in practical situations is inherently problematic. Life is not neatly arranged, our knowledge and understanding of the world around us is incomplete, and our motives are complex and inconsistent. An excellent example of these difficulties is the famous tuna-dolphin conflict.3 The Senior Lecturer, Newcastle Law School.

The purpose of this article is to analyse the legislative debates that gave rise to the original legislation and the 1997 amendments in the light of some relevant ethical theories and examine the extent to which a coherent ethical approach can be identified. 2. Factual Background At issue in the tuna-dolphin dispute was the encirclement of dolphins by purse seine nets when fishing for yellowfin tuna in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP).7 By the early 1970s US tuna seiners were estimated to be causing the deaths of more than 300,000 dolphins a year,8 and there was increasing public revulsion at the num- bers of dolphins killed or injured and the cruelty involved in chasing, encircling and trapping them. The MMPA was passed with the intention, inter alia, of reducing the incidental killing or injuring of marine mammals, including dolphins, in the course of commercial fishing.9 In particular, it imposed a limit on the permissible number of incidental killings of dolphins by US tuna seiners, and provided for bans on the importation of fish or fish products caught with commercial fishing technology that had caused a level of incidental killing or injuring of marine mammals exceeding US standards.10 Exceptions were granted to certain native American groups in order to preserve subsistence hunting, and cultural and economic practices.11 As well as the legal constraints of the MMPA, tuna seiners were subjected to strong commercial pressure. In 1990, the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act 4 16 USC §§1361-1421(11) (1994). 5 The reports were not adopted under the old GATT procedure of dispute settlement which required consent from all parties, including the party found to be in the wrong. The US was therefore able to block their adoption, but would now be unable to do so under the Dispute Settlement Understanding of the WTO Charter. 6 Similar issues have already arisen, for example, over EC proposals to restrict imports of furs acquired through the use of leghold traps, and cosmetics tested on animals. The US has recently been found in violation of its GATT obligations with regard to import restrictions on shrimp caught without using approved techniques to protect endangered turtles. See United States: Import Prohibition of Certain Shrimp and Shrimp Products , WT/ DS58/R (15.5.98) and WT/DS58/AB/R (12.10.98). 7 Yellowfin tuna are often found swimming beneath schools of dolphins, a fact exploited by fishers using a method known as dolphin setting. Schools of dolphin are chased for long periods by motorboats and helicopters, and explosives are used to herd the dolphins together until they are exhausted. The dolphins and tuna are encircled by a purse seine net, and the cable at the bottom of the net is pulled together in order to form a 'purse' before the whole net is winched up. 8 E.H. Buck, 'Dolphin Protection and Tuna Seining', Cong Res Serv Rep 96-011 (1997). The objective is to reduce killings to 'insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate' 16 USC §137 1(a)(2). 10 16 USC §i37i(a)(2). 11 This right may not be exercised in a 'wasteful manner' 16 USC § 1371(b).</page><page sequence="3">LAW AND ETHICS IN THE TRADE AND ENVIRONMENT DEBATE 295 set standards for the labelling of tuna as 'dolphin-safe', which prevented the descrip- tion being used for tuna which had been caught by dolphin setting,12 and American tuna canning companies representing approximately 80% of the US market announced that they would only buy and sell tuna that complied with these standards. The International Dolphin Conservation Act of 1992 prohibited the sale, purchase, transport or shipment in the US of tuna that was not classified as ťdolphin-safe'13 In response, tuna seiners developed improved techniques for protecting dolphins, including releasing them from the net, or moved their fishing operations elsewhere in the Pacific where dolphins were less likely to be associated with tuna. Estimated dolphin mortality caused by American tuna fishers dropped dramatically from 368,600 in 1972 to 5,083 in 1990. By 1995-96, American figures of dolphin mortal- ity in the ETP had apparently reached zero.14 However, as American dolphin mortality levels dropped and US-registered boats left the fishery, it became difficult for foreign tuna fishers to meet the required com- parability standards.15 The MMPA import bans were challenged twice under the GATT rules. In 1990, Mexico brought a complaint against a US ban on the imports of tuna caught by Mexican fishermen,16 and in 1992 the EEC and others brought complaints about import bans on their processed tuna imposed because it came, or might have come, from fishing fleets that did not comply with the MMPA standards of dolphin safety.17 In both cases the US was found to be in violation of its obligations under the GATT.18 The GATT panel findings provoked an intense public debate, part of which was articulated in the US legislature's response to the political and legal pressures being brought to bear. The goal of dolphin protection remained unchanged, but by this time it was clear that the issues were not as simple as originally thought. Diversion of fishing activities away from dolphins had resulted in tuna fishers turn- ing increasingly to two other means of catching tuna, namely log setting and school setting. The first involves the encirclement of floating logs and other debris to catch the tuna swimming below, while the second entails the encirclement of shoals of tuna alone. Both methods result in a high rate of bycatch, that is, the killing of other 12 16 USC §1385 (1994). 13 16 USC §i4i7(a)(i) (1994). 14 E.H. Buck, supra, n 8. 15 The Lajolla Agreement was concluded in 1992 to govern permitted dolphin kills under a voluntary interna- tional regime, known as the International Dolphin Conservation Programme (IDCP), Agreement for the Reduc- tion of Dolphin Mortality in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, adopted June 1992, 33 ILM 936 (1994). The parties were Columbia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Spain, United States, Vanuatu and Vene- zuela. It was followed by the Panama Declaration in 1995 under which the IDCP would become legally binding provided the USA lifted its import bans on tuna caught in compliance with the agreement and changed its definition of 'dolphin-safe' to include tuna caught by dolphin setting which did not entail any observed dolphin deaths. Without these changes, it was feared that the other countries would withdraw from the international scheme altogether. 16 United States: Restrictions on Import of Tuna, Panel Report, GATT BISD sqS/155, 30 ILM 1594 (lqqi). 17 United States: Restrictions on Imports of Tuna, Panel Report, DS2Q/R, 33 ILM 8sq (1004). 18 The legal provisions that formed the basis of the complaints by Mexico and the EEC were Article XI and Article III of the GATT, which prohibit the use of import restrictions and measures which discriminate between domestic and imported 'like products' respectively. The defences available under Article XX paragraphs (b) and (g), concerning protection of life, health and natural resources, could not apply to unilateral measures intended to coerce other GATT parties into changing their environmental polices. See, for example, I.C. Cheyne, 'Environmental Unilateralism and the WTO/GATT System', Georgia Journal of International and Comparative Law (1995) 24, 433-65; J.P. Trachtman, 'GATT Dispute Settlement Panel', American Journal of International Law (1992) 86, 142-51.</page><page sequence="4">296 ILONA CHEYNE species such as sharks and sea turtles and the taking of immature tuna. Some of these species are already endangered, and there is a risk that catching immature tuna which have not yet reproduced will eventually threaten the viability of the tuna stocks. At the same time, fishing techniques had been developed which allowed dol- phins to be netted and released19 and which therefore possibly reduced the threat to dolphins from death or injury to the stress of chase and encirclement. The response of the US Congress to these complex issues was the amendment of the MMPA by the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act of 199720 (the '1997 Act'). The Act removes tuna import prohibitions against States which comply with internationally agreed restrictions.21 It also provides that the definition of 'dol- phin-safe' includes tuna caught by dolphin setting if observers certify that no dolphins were killed or seriously injured during their chase and encirclement.22 However, this is only to be put into effect if research indicates that no long-term harm will be caused to dolphin populations by the dolphin-setting technique.23 The Congressional debates in 1971-72 and 1996-97, which resulted in the MMPA and the 1997 Act respectively, illustrate the difficulties in answering the question of how to rank the competing interests of different species. Human interests lie in large-scale fishing, partly as a means of livelihood, partly to support a comfortable standard of living, and partly as an expression of cultural values. Individual tuna have an interest in survival and, as a species, were potentially threatened with extinction if log setting were to continue. Individual dolphins have an interest in survival and in avoiding stress and suffering. There are also human interests in the existence value of dolphins, although the possibility of the dolphin species involved becoming extinct was not a major issue. By contrast, turtles, sharks and other collaterally affected species not only had an interest in individual survival, but also faced the possibility of extinction. It is clear that the MMPA and its 1997 amendments protected the interests of humans and dolphins to a high degree. The question of how this result was achieved and what ethical arguments were brought to bear is the subject of the following analysis. 3. The Major Ethical Theories and Their Role in the Congressional Debates 3.1 Introduction Ethical thought may be either normative or descriptive. The former is concerned with what we ought to do, the latter with examining the arguments and values employed. The latter is particularly relevant to legal analysis, allowing us to examine the ethical roots of legal principles, and the ethical implications of their interpreta- tion and application. The process of revealing ethical positions which underlie the 19 The most important technique was the letting down of the back of the nets to allow dolphins to escape. See E.H.

Discovery of ethical viewpoints within legal or political discourse is problematic, except on the occasions that explicit ethical arguments are put to rhetorical use. In the case of the tuna-dolphin debate, the actors ranged from concerned individuals and NGOs to legislators and GATT dispute panels. As issues were raised, discussed and interpreted, the explicitness of ethical values became progressively diluted as more formalistic legal arguments became increasingly dominant. Within the formal GATT panel proceedings, the ethical issues were left largely unvoiced. Both panels explicitly distanced themselves from any consideration of the appropriateness of the conservation policies in question. They consciously remained within the strict limits of formalistic reasoning, venturing outside the interpretation of plain words only to ensure that legal rights and duties were observed. Con- sequently, they excluded the relevance of an external set of normative values. How- ever, the participants in the debate outside the panel proceedings looked more closely at the ethical issues. The most explicit suggestions of what ethical issues underpinned the tuna-dolphin dispute are to be found in the Congressional legislative debates for the original MMPA and the 1997 Act amending it, and the following analysis will focus primarily on these arguments. It is not clear from the record how important the ethical arguments were to each Congressional speaker, or the extent to which they might have been used in order to further other agendas. Even environmental NGOs could not be assumed to be exclusively concerned with environmental values, given the highly political role some play in influencing policy decisions. At least three were accused outright of being motivated by financial concerns.24 One of the most notable characteristics of the debates, therefore, was the inextric- able link between the ethical and the political, and the blurring of the distinctions between them. Even speakers who expressed strong ethical views usually acknow- ledged the likely effects in other policy spheres, such as employment. Most speakers argued strongly for a single view, aiming for persuasive simplicity rather than a com- plex analysis of the conflicting values and arguments. Some made a plea for com- promise and practical results rather than ethical purity.25 The lack of a clear ethical theme or shared framework of analysis in the Congres- sional debates is typical of many public policy discussions of controversial environ- mental issues.26 Before considering environmental theories which might offer a coher- ent conceptual apparatus for tackling the problem of conflicting interests,27 however, three fundamental issues must be examined: moral considerability, moral signific- ance, and knowledge. 24 They included Earth Island Institute and Greenpeace. 142 Cong Rec H9435 (1996) (remarks by Rep Cunningham); 143 Cong Rec H3127 (1997) (Marshall, Letter placed on record by Rep Faleomavaega). 142 Cong Rec H9433-H9434 (1996) (remarks by Rep Boehlert). Cases in point are the current international debates about sustainable development and protection of biodiversity and, in Britain, controversial issues such as foxhunting. 27 For excellent discussions of the main environmental theories and their implications, see J.

Elliot (ed), Environmental Ethics (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1995).</page><page sequence="6">298 ILONA CHEYNE 3. 1. 1 Moral considerability The question of moral considerability is concerned with the beneficiaries of ethical acts and intentions. Traditionally, humans automatically possess moral considerabil- ity. In western liberal tradition this is usually claimed to be on the basis that morality is consensual and that only humans are capable of the necessary rational thought and judgment to act morally ('moral actors'). The existence of wider moral considerability therefore depends on whether we are prepared to recognise value in, or confer it upon, non-rational entities (ťmoral patients'). Many environmentalists argue that it is irrational to limit moral worth to humans in that, while only humans can have duties , there is no reason why non-rational entities should not have interests or rights. Indeed to deny this much has obnoxious implications in respect of humans who are incapable of rationality. Value for this purpose can be divided into two types. The first is instrumental value, which accrues as a result of usefulness. Where this directly benefits human beings, the basis for moral considerability is characterised as anthropocentric. Because instrumental value usually favours human interests, it is the least controver- sial claim in public policy discourse and, unsurprisingly, was the most recurrent theme of the tuna-dolphin debate.28 For example, the right of humans to exploit tuna was unquestioned subject to a need to conserve them, but only so that the exploitation could continue. Instrumental value may include cases where humans receive pleasure from knowing that something exists, or where, taking a precaution- ary approach, it is advisable to protect entities in order to ensure our own survival. This perception of value is sometimes termed enlightened anthropocentrism,29 and was also evident in the tuna-dolphin debates. Dolphins were commonly described as having value because of the pleasure they gave to humans, and some references were made to the significance that destroying dolphins and other species might have on humanity's survival.30 Other reasons included their 'gentle, helpful nature' and the 'tremendous psychological benefit' they gave to humans,31 that they were not threatening to humans, and that they had sometimes saved human lives.32 There was also evidence of extended anthropocentrism, in that concern was expressed for future generations.33 28 See E. Sober, 'Philosophical Problems for Environmentalist!!' in R. Elliot, supra, n 27. 29 See, for example, J. Passmore, Man's Responsibility for Nature: Ecological Problems and Western Tradition , 2nd edn (London: Gerald Duckworth, 1980). It is sometimes argued that policies benefiting humans will also in the long run benefit the rest of nature although it is difficult to see how this purely empirical proposition could be verified, see B. Norton, Towards Unity Among Environmentalists (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1991). 30 See, for example, Senator Cranston: 'The survival of man himself may ultimately depend on the survival of a diversity of flora and fauna ... If we fail to maintain our fish and wildlife as viable life forms, then we will close the door on the possibility of restoring the natural and complex ecosystems which future knowledge may dictate as essential for human survival' 118 Cong Rec S25268 (1972). Also Senator Tunney, 'we have at last realised that, in order for man to survive, he must be willing to modify his behaviour to accommodate other species of life which are vital to a smooth continuity of the life cycle of his environment', ibid. 142 Cong Rec H9428 (1996) (remarks of Rep Faleomavaega). 32 Ibid. Some speakers acknowledged that dolphins were pretty, swam well and made the sea more attractive by their presence, 142 Cong Rec H9431 (1996) (remarks of Rep Faleomavaega); 143 Cong Rec H3121 (1997) (remarks of Rep Young). Others said they cherished or loved dolphins, 142 Cong Rec H9425 (1996) (remarks of Rep Goss); ibid at H9434 (1996) (remarks of Rep Gibbons). 33 See, for example, letter written by Senators Hollings and Stevens to the Evening Star and Daily News : 'The animals of our ecosystem, in fact all of the life of our planet, must be managed wisely to preserve our ecosystem .for all generations.' 118 Cong Rec S25277-8 (1972) (placed on record by Sen Stevens); and see Congressman</page><page sequence="7">LAW AND ETHICS IN THE TRADE AND ENVIRONMENT DEBATE 299 The second type of value, usually termed intrinsic value, is value that lies in and for the possessor.34 Its advantage as a basis of environmental protection is its inde- pendence from the changing needs and desires of humans. The key goal of environ- mental ethical theories, but the most elusive, is the discovery of a satisfactory explanation of how intrinsic value may exist. The problem that these theories encoun- ter is that the basis on which they identify or recognise intrinsic value cannot be entirely separated from human interests and values. Thus the tuna-dolphin debates revealed some recognition that dolphins possessed value in themselves but on the basis of characteristics that humans value, such as intelligence and beauty.35 There was little evidence of any recognition of value existing outside human interests and conceptions, which meant that dolphins, turtles and tuna were treated differently. 3.1.2 Moral significance: interest ranking The question of differential treatment of moral patients is one of moral significance.36 The degree of moral significance owed to each entity was crucial in a case like the tuna-dolphin situation where the needs or desires of different moral patients were in conflict and required ranking. This involves two dangers: first, that we are tempted to find justifications for giving greater importance to human wants and needs over those of other species and, second, that we only recognise or give preferential weight to interests or characteristics that are shared by us. Unsurprisingly, therefore, it is a fundamental problem for environmental theories to balance human needs and desires against those of other moral patients in a way which does not automatically privilege those of humans - otherwise any attempt to develop non-anthropocentric environmental ethical theories would be largely futile. On the other hand, denying priority to human interests has consequences which we intuitively find offensive.37 The problem of ranking species and interests also occurs between non-humans where humans feel obliged to find a principled basis on which to interfere, abstain from interference or decide which should suffer the least from human activity. In the case of the tuna-dolphin problem, there were a number of Pelly, 'the living natural resources of this planet are irreplaceable and should be protected and conserved for the benefit of future generations' 117 Cong Rec H44955 (1071). 34 Some writers use this term to indicate value which exists independently of the existence of any human valuers. In this paper, however, it will be used in the broader sense of value which is not of direct or indirect exploitable value to humans. 35 See, for example, Congressman Ryan: 'Marvels of adaptation to their environment, possessed of highly developed intelligence, often characterised by an acute sense of protectiveness for their fellows, the mammals of the world's oceans are irreplaceable' 117 Cong Rec H44958 (1971) (testimony of Congressman Ryan before the Subcommittee on Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation of the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries placed on record by Rep Ryan). See also Senator Harris, 'we all know that the dolphin is one of the most intelligent creatures in the sea' 118 Cong Rec S25271 (1972); also Senator Williams, 'porpoises and dolphins . . . have long been recognised as being among the most intelligent and highly evolved of all the world's creatures', ibid at S25288. Similar views were expressed in the 1996-97 debates, for example, see Faleomava- ega, supra, n 31. But note that doubts are now being expressed about the intelligence and altruism of dolphins. M.

Ranking may also involve giving greater priority to certain types of needs or wants over others which, in the tuna-dolphin case, ranged from the need to survive to consumer preference for tuna when other foods were equally available. The livelihood of Mexican fishermen, the relative cost of using other fishing techniques, the standard of living expected by US fishermen, the stress caused to dolphins, the wish for the comfort of knowing that dolphins had not suffered and the potential extinction of turtles as a species, for example, all had to be considered, evaluated and prioritised. 3. i. 3 Knowledge The questions of moral considerability and moral significance cannot be answered coherently without addressing the question of knowledge. In particular how do we know whatever characteristics we claim are required to be a moral patient actually exist? For example, some theorists have suggested that animals should have moral considerability if they are capable of suffering.38 However, we can only make an edu- cated guess as to whether such a capacity exists in non-humans based on our under- standing of what makes it possible to suffer, such as an identifiable nervous system, or on what we interpret as the outward signs of suffering.39 For example two different scientific reports presented to Congressional committees came to opposite conclu- sions as to whether there was evidence of lasting damage caused by the stress of chase and encirclement.40 One speaker argued that the alleged stress caused to dolphins by chasing and encirclement could not form the basis of policy decisions because of the lack of scient- ific knowledge.41 Other speakers, however, appeared to assume knowledge of the existence and degree of suffering endured by dolphins by reference to human reac- tions to similar conditions.42 We may feel relatively confident that we understand the interests of animals with which we are familiar and which share characteristics with us, for we can be reason- ably sure that they will want many of the things that we would like, such as warmth, sufficient food and shelter. However, we cannot be so certain about less basic activit- 38 J. Bentham, Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation , Burns and Hart (eds), (London: Athlone, 1970); P. Singer, Animal Liberation , 2nd edn (London: Pimlico, 1995). 39 See P. Singer, ibid; J. Benson, 'Duty and the Beast', Philosophy (1978) 53, 529-49. 40 Hearings before the Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, and Oceans of the House Committee on Resources, 104th Cong, 2nd Sess 112 (1996) (statement by N.M. Young), ibid, 2nd Sess 3 (June 1996) (statement by A.C. Myrick Jr). For a review of different scientific findings, see N.M. Young, W.R. Irvin and M.L. McLean, supra, n 3 at 106-10, and K.L. Stewart, supra, n 3 at 132-4. The question of the effects of chase and encirclement on survival was surprisingly controversial. It is probable that the same group of dolphins can be subjected to high speed chasing with explosives several times in the same day. Mothers can become separated from their calves, while exhaustion and stress may cause injury, death or reduction of the ability to reproduce, statement by Myrick (above). 41 143 Cong Rec H3132 (1997) (remarks of Rep Gilchrest). 42 See, for example, Congressman Faleomavaega, 'dolphins are just like humans', supra, n 31. Perhaps the most explicit example is in the report of one scientist who supplemented his science-based arguments with an anthropocentric device. The audience was invited to imagine human beings being pursued relentlessly by frightening machines using explosives and herded into a small space in surroundings liable to collapse at any moment, Myrick, supra, n 40. The purpose of this strategy seemed to be to allow us to 'know' the dolphins' experience on the basis of 'common sense'. Its persuasive force stems entirely from our ability to imagine ourselves in the dolphins' situation, which requires a sense of shared emotional capacity which can only exist if we assume that dolphins are capable of the same feelings and thoughts as humans.</page><page sequence="9">LAW AND ETHICS IN THE TRADE AND ENVIRONMENT DEBATE 3OI ies which do not affect individual survival, such as raising young to maturity or playing games. In the case of the tuna-dolphin debates, it was commonly acknowledged that more knowledge was needed before making final decisions.43 However, the MMPA as a whole was proposed on the basis that, even though further research was required, enough was known to enable appropriate management of marine mammal popula- tions.44 Interestingly, the one assumption that was never explicitly questioned in the tuna-dolphin debates, namely dolphins' intelligence and altruism,45 is now being chal- lenged. There is increasing evidence that dolphins do not necessarily have gentle natures and that they can sometimes be dangerous to humans. They may also not be as intelligent as some have suggested.46 An equally fundamental question of knowledge relates to future generations of humans; we do not really know, for example, if they will exist at all, who they will be, or what needs, interests and desires they will possess.47 In particular, we do not know whether they will share our values as to the continuing existence and flourishing of different species. Some speakers did, however, assume that future generations would want the continued existence of marine mammals as a whole and dolphins in particular.48 4. The Traditional Theories and Their Extensions As noted above, it has been difficult for traditional ethical schools to avoid granting centrality to human interests, knowledge and values, even when they extend moral considerability to non-human entities. They may be divided according to their emphasis on different aspects of the ethical decision-making process: the con- sequences of an act, the principles on which acts should be based, and the intention behind the act. 4.1 Judaeo-Christian traditions A common form of the Judeao-Christian tradition emphasises that humanity was given dominion over the world by God,49 the grant of which can be interpreted as allowing humans to use nature for whatever purpose they please.50 As a result, using and taming nature can be interpreted as a positive duty.51 At the very least it pro- 43 See, for example, Gilchrest, supra, n 41; and 118 Cong Rec S25253 (1972) (remarks of Sen Hollings). 44 See, for example, 118 Cong Rec S25254 (1972) (remarks of Sen Hollings); ibid at S25267 and S25258 (remarks of Sen Stevens); 143 Cong Rec H3120 (1997) (remarks of Rep Saxton) (IDCPA is also a management scheme). 45 M.

Tuna were never considered as having a right to life or a right not to suffer. The only concern expressed about their well-being was the possibility that humans would lose a valuable resource.53 In so far as these speakers also accepted the need to protect dolphins in order to continue to enjoy the benefit of tuna exploitation, their views could also be characterised as enlightened anthropocentrism. In general, it was a commonly expressed assumption that marine mammals as a whole could be exploited, even if caution should be exercised in order to avoid complete extinction.54 In the case of one speaker, this extended as far as the right to exploit animals for sport as well as food.55 One challenge to the 'ownership' interpretation of the Judaeo-Christian doctrines is that they instead impose upon us a duty of stewardship and reverence.56 'Dominion', in this version, connotes caretaking rather than freedom to act as one pleases, and transforms the permissive version into a theory of responsibility.57 It provides an attitude towards the environment rather than specific behavioural prescriptions. Some aspects of this approach can be seen in the tuna-dolphin debates, although direct references are scarce.58 A key theme in the original debates on marine mammal protection as a whole, however, was the need for management, not just to ensure that extinction of exploitable resources could be prevented but also in the interests of the animals themselves.59 There was also a strong feeling that exploitation of 52 The philosophical roots of modern industrialisation may be traced in particular to the science-led ideas of Bacon and the mechanistic view of Descartes which both emphasise the power of humanity to exercise control over the world.

It underpins democratic or majoritarian political systems, and its so-called 'daughter' discipline of liberal economics.61 The liberal economic approach to the environment has often been criticised on practical or ideological grounds,62 but Sagoff has presented a specific challenge to it as a basis for ethical action. Sagoff argues that it only tells us what people want , and not what they value. As citizens, they may wish to act according to what they believe rather than what they want as consumers. In his view, therefore, a liberal economic approach to the environment cannot promote ethical choices.63 The question of what consumers might want was discussed indirectly in the context of cruelty and the definition of 'dolphin safe'. Several speakers argued that allowing this definition to include the method of chase and encirclement would be extremely misleading for consumers.64 It was clear that many speakers who argued that con- sumers would be horrified to know that 'dolphin-safe' tuna had been caught by sub- jecting dolphins to a high-speed chase until they were exhausted did so because con- sumers would think it was cruel.65 60 Even the exceptions made to allow American taking of marine mammals were restricted to ensure 'that the taking by natives is not conducted in an irresponsible, wasteful fashion' (Dingell, ibid at H44953) and 143 Cong Rec S792 (iQQ7) (remarks of Sen Biden). 61 Since the international trade regime is based on liberal economic theory, it is not surprising that the GATT, and now the WTO, have taken the view that environmental matters should be governed by consumer choice and that environmental standards can only rise when consumers are sufficiently prosperous to be able to accommodate them. This view, of course, has been challenged. See, for example, Hines and Lang, The New Protectionism: Protecting the Future against Free Trade (London: Earthscan, 1993). In the meantime, the rights of parties to the WTO to use trade barriers in order to protect environmental goods which may be damaged or lost through economic activity are significantly restricted. There are provisions in the GATT rules which allow measures to be taken in order to protect the environment, e.g. standard-setting for imports, and protection of domestic human, animal or plant life or health, but even these are not wide enough in the view of some environmentalist observers.

Schoenbaum, 'International Trade and Pro- tection of the Environment: The Continuing Search for Reconciliation', American Journal of International Law (1997) 91, 268-308. The major criticisms are that it is extremely difficult to value environmental goods, particularly in the case of aesthetic or existence value, and that liberal economic theory relies on the existence of a perfect market mechanism which does not, and perhaps cannot, exist in practice.

Other than the principle of truth in labelling, the fear seemed to be that consumers would suffer deep unhappi- ness at being misled into encouraging unsafe fishing practices and at the fact that dolphins were being harassed and killed. This fear seemed to be particularly strong with regard to children whose potential unhappiness was apparently more important than the unhappiness of other consumers. It is arguable that children represent in some part Sagoff's conception of the citizen who holds strong values and whose idealism allows them to separate</page><page sequence="12">304 ILONA CHEYNE With respect to the question of moral considerability, it is possible to extend utilit- arianism beyond humans to all beings that possess the capacity for happiness or suffering.66 For example, Singer argues that the capacity for suffering or happiness is a necessary condition for having interests which can be discussed in any meaningful way.67 In his view, we can distinguish between different levels of suffering or happi- ness, but not between the different species that experience them. If we do distinguish between the relative value of interests purely on the grounds of what kind of animal possesses them, we are guilty of 'speciesism' which, like its analogous counterparts racism and sexism, promotes behaviour which cannot be ethically supported. How- ever, Singer accepts that we may distinguish between the characteristics themselves and, therefore, that animals may sometimes be killed in favour of human interests.68 Indeed, it was evident in the tuna-dolphin debate that the capacity of humans, dol- phins, turtles and tuna to suffer was considered to be significantly different. Singer would also argue, however, that the killing must be accompanied by proper respect, avoiding cruelty and wastefulness.69 In so far as these concerns were expressed in the tuna-dolphin debates, they were focused on marine mammals, especially dol- phins, and hardly at all on turtles or tuna. Apart from its vulnerability to the many general problems with utilitarianism,70 Singer's approach raises two main problems for environmental ethics. The first is that it includes only those animals capable of suffering which raises the question of knowledge.71 The second problem is that Singer would hold that moral considerability only extends to individuals, and not to a species or other environmental goods such as ecosystems because the latter is not capable of suffering or experiencing happiness. Extended utilitarianism therefore has inherent limitations as an environmental theory.72 As far as the tuna-dolphin debates are concerned, it would explain the universal concern about wasteful killing of individual dolphins and the need to pre- vent unnecessary suffering, but not the opposing reluctance to allow a species, such as turtles, to become extinct where the individuals of that species lacked character- istics that were valued as highly as those of dolphins. Ultimately, the solution adopted in the legislation was utilitarian because it reflected the view of the majority of legislators. However, difficulties remain. For example, the test of consumers' happiness was based on the assumption that it was them from short-term or selfish desires. A more cynical argument of course, is that children are major con- sumers of tuna in the US and that it was important not to alienate them. 66 This is separate from the unhappiness that humans might feel at the thought of animals being made to suffer. 67 Singer, supra, n 38 at 7. Thus he distinguishes between a stone and a mouse being kicked along a road. The first cannot be said to have an interest in not being kicked, whereas the mouse's capacity to suffer means that it does. Ibid at 7-8. 68 Ibid at 15-16. Killing a dog for the amusement or convenience of human beings would be unacceptable because it is based on an inherent privileging of humans rather than balancing the relative importance of interests possessed by both species. In this analysis, the assumptions that tuna could be exploited by humans and that the only choice was between preventing the suffering of dolphins and avoiding the extinction of another would constitute speciesism.

Consumers were referred to in the debates as a homogenous body, with no variation in ethical views or behavi- our amongst its members even though it was extremely likely that some consumers were not interested in, or were ignorant of, the issues surrounding the catching of tuna. They might have actively preferred to buy tuna if it was cheaper, which would probably be the case if no efforts were made to avoid injury to dolphins. They might simply have been misled about the issues.73 4.3 Deontology The deontological approach, based on the concept of rights and duties, is predicated on our status as rational actors capable of choosing between different courses of action on the basis of our beliefs, values and intentions. Since we cannot know with certainty the consequences of our actions, it is argued that it is more appropriate for us to concentrate on our own behaviour because that at least is under our control. The criteria for ethical behaviour proposed by Kant, namely that it should be based on respect, an acknowledgment of rights of equality and freedom, and reciprocity, have obvious drawbacks in the environmental context because they preclude non- rational beings or objects from being direct beneficiaries.74 Although Kant argued that we should treat animals properly, he did so on the grounds that we owed our- selves an indirect duty to act well. Cruelty to animals might lead us to ill-treat human beings, and would show, or develop, a bad character in oneself.75 There are, however, a number of ways in which the concept of rights and duties has been extended beyond humans. Regan has proposed extending rights to 'subjects of a life' ('SOAL').76 This differs from the mere capacity to suffer, as used in Singer's analysis, by including other psychological elements such as the possession of beliefs, desires, an appreciation of the past and future, and emotions. According to Regan, any creature possessing these characteristics (hypothetically mammals of one year or more), has inherent value independent of any value or use they might have for humans. Having inherent value in turn requires respect. Justice demands that all creatures with inherent value are treated equally, as an end and not as a means.77 In the tuna-dolphin debates, no speaker argued against the protection of dolphins, and most speakers explicitly or implicitly favoured the goal of achieving zero mortality.78 73 See N.M. Young, W.R. Irvin and M.L. McLean, supra, n 3 at 75-7. 74 See, for example, M. Midgley, 'Duties Concerning Islands' in Elliot, supra, n 27 at 89-103. 75 I. Kant, 'Duties Towards Animals and Spirits' in Lectures in Ethics (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1963) 239-41. 76 T. Regan, The Case for Animal Rights (Berkeley: California UP, 1983). 77 However, it is again noticeable that the choice of these qualifying characteristics automatically privileges humans and, according to the assumptions made by many speakers, ranks dolphins over other species such as turtles and tuna. In addition, as was the case with Singer, rights-based arguments raise problems of knowledge and may conflict with broader environmental concerns because they assign value only to individuals and address problems of species and habitat extinction only incidentally. 78 However, this did not always mean that dolphins were recognised as having an absolute right not to be killed as one might expect from the perspective of rights analysis. The common view was that a permitted level of dolphin kills and a movement towards the goal of zero mortality over a period of time was acceptable, supra, nn 44, 59 and 60. In the 1996-97 debates, this was sometimes expressed as a criticism that the Panama Declaration and the proposed legislation permitted a threshold of 5,000 dolphin deaths a year although in practice dolphin deaths were already much lower. See, for example, 143 Cong Rec H3121 (1997) (remarks of Rep Abercrombie); ibid at H3129 (remarks of Rep Miller). On the other hand, there was a strong view that rejected the acceptability of any dolphin death occurring. Some of the lobbyists against the management</page><page sequence="14">3O6 ILONA CHEYNE A final issue in the application of rights theory needs to be addressed, namely the question of how rights possessed by non-human entities can be meaningfully enforced. Stone, writing from a legal perspective, has argued that the natural environment should be given legal standing and that, just as in the case of corporations and legally incompetent humans, a guardian or trustee could be appointed to represent their legal interests.79 However, this does not itself answer the question of how we know what the entity's interests actually are.80 Stone argues that we have duties to prevent damage, and to restore the environment if damage does occur. It may immediately be objected that the different views held by people on what constitutes damage and what would be appropriate restoration leaves the question of what the entity wants or needs largely unanswered. The knowledge and ethical beliefs of any representative would therefore be decisive. In the tuna-dolphin debates, the arguments based on the needs of different species can be seen as attempts to represent those species. However, at least one speaker explicitly adopted the role of representative for dolphins. Tellingly, the message he chose to give on their behalf was vague, namely that failure to protect dolphins would lead to 'mankind' being 'held accountable for its actions'.81 He also argued that dol- phins should not be killed or made to suffer.82 It is interesting to speculate what other 'representatives' might decide were the thoughts and desires of dolphins. It was not suggested, for example, that dolphins might enjoy being chased or that dol- phins as a species might be strengthened by the selective forces of hunting and encir- clement.83 Human perceptions and values dominated the views of those claiming, explicitly or implicitly, to represent dolphins and might explain why there was no attempt to represent other species such as turtles or tuna in the same way. 4.4 Virtue ethics Virtue ethics focuses on the intention and character of the moral actor rather than prescriptive duties. Virtue ethics is, above all, about flourishing according to one's nature. It attempts to accommodate the problem of knowledge by accepting that we cannot always know what the consequences of an act will be, or whether a potential moral patient possesses relevant qualifying characteristics, or other relevant factors. It therefore tends towards a broader, more encompassing view of these matters than is the case with the systems of ethics discussed above. Virtue ethics would suggest that we should be careful about the effects of our actions, for example, by avoiding waste and cruelty. It also leans towards the precautionary principle which forms part of international environmental policy, a belief that humans should act with modera- approach to marine mammals wanted an immediate end to any killing; see e.g. 118 Cong Rec S25267, S25271 and S25274-5 (1972) (remarks of Sen Harris). 79 Stone's ideas have been developed in a number of works, including 'Should Trees Have Standing? Towards Legal Rights for Natural Objects', Southern California Law Review (1972) 45, 450-501; 'Should Trees Have Standing? Revisited', Southern California Law Review (1985) 59, 1-154; anc^ supra, n 2. For a different example of this type of argument, see A. D'Amato and S.K. Chopra, 'Whales: Their Emerging Right to Life', American Journal of International Law (1991) 85, 21-62. 80 For a critique of Stone's approach, see Rodman, supra, n 72. 81 Supra, n *1. 82 Ibid. 83 See D.J. Des Jardins, supra, n 27 at 170-2.</page><page sequence="15">LAW AND ETHICS IN THE TRADE AND ENVIRONMENT DEBATE 307 tion in the hope of avoiding harm even in situations where it cannot be clearly fore- seen. The approach of the MMPA as a whole was commonly expressed as being pre- cautionary.84 In the 1996-97 debates, some seemed to argue against the precautionary principle. They felt that dolphin setting should not be resumed until more was known about the bycatch problem,85 while others objected because they did not think that an observer system would be able to record or prevent all dolphin deaths.86 The definition of virtue, according to most versions of this school of thought, is based on the Aristotlean teleological tradition. Thus, in order to flourish as nature intended, human beings must use their rationality as well as possible, and display virtues in their thought and actions. Rationality requires that moral actors avoid subjective or arbitrary reasons for their acts, and demands instead a process of consid- eration and evaluation. Virtues include promoting the flourishing of moral patients. Thus, for example, Cooper suggests that the key virtues include responsibility, care, kindness and solicitude.87 They are virtues in the sense that they represent aspects of the good life for which humans should strive.88 In addition, and perhaps more importantly, they lead to altruistic acts towards other species and the environment in general without requiring or expecting reciprocal benefits. The emphasis in virtue ethics on the flourishing of non-human species and ecosystems means that, of all the traditional theories, it encompasses non-anthropocentric values most easily. However, the questions of what constitutes flourishing and what is ethical behaviour must still be answered, if only in the form of guidelines or moderating principles. The idea of virtue ethics can be used conceptually as an umbrella for new theories that have been developed specifically to engage with environmental issues, and which may therefore provide insight into how a virtue ethics approach might be put into practice. 5. The New Environmental Ethical Theories The 'new' environmental theories, which include extensions from traditional theoret- ical starting points, begin with the premise that nature possesses value independent 84 See, for example, Congressman Kyros, speaking on marine mammals and the need for a long moratorium on taking, '[W]e do not know enough about these animal species' levels of intelligence or how useful they may be to man. We do not know how many animals may be taken, or killed, before we do irreparable damage to our ecological system' 117 Cong Rec H44954 (1971). Congressman Pelly showed some ambivalence on this point: 'Certainly, where there is a lack of scientific information as to whether or not a current level of taking is harmful to the species and the marine ecosystem, it would be advisable to approach the issuance of permits from a conservative standpoint . . . However, this is not to say . . . that the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce should establish arbitrary low or high levels of permissible taking solely from a fear of the unknown . . . [he] must base his levels of limitations on sound scientific and technical evidence and consequently has the burden of proof of justifying his decision from all of the evidence presented and available.' Ibid at H44956. Also Senator Hollings: 'In creating this moratorium the committee recognised that we lack adequate scientific knowledge of many species. On the other hand, we cannot eliminate thousands of American jobs and millions of dollars worth of industrial investment by acting irrationally on the basis of emotional misinformation from persons who seek to paint over a complex issue with one broad sweep of the brush.' 118 Cong Rec S25253 (1972). 143 Cong Rec 790 (1997) (remarks of Sen Boxer). 86 Ibid; 142 Cong Rec H9442-3 (1996) (remarks of Rep Studds); Stark, supra, n 65. 87 D.E Cooper, 'Other Species and Moral Reason' in D.E. Cooper and J. A. Palmer (eds ),Just Environments (London: Routledge, 1995) 137-48 at 146. 88 Cooper also suggests other capacities which promote flourishing and the good life, namely imagination, openness and empathy. Ibid at 145.</page><page sequence="16">308 ILONA CHEYNE of human interests.89 Two are of particular relevance to the tuna-dolphin debates and will be examined here: the biocentric and ecocentric approaches.90 5.1 Biocentric approaches The biocentric approach assigns intrinsic value to all life.91 A strong expression of this idea may be found in the writings of Schweitzer, who argued for 'reverence for life'.92 This means assisting life and avoiding harm wherever possible without judg- ment as to the relative value of different forms of life.93 One of the important aspects of this idea is that it does not purport to lay down principles of conduct which may apply in any given situation, but that it describes an attitude to life.94 A more philosophically detailed version of this idea has recently been developed by Taylor, who argues for an attitude he calls 'respect for nature'.95 He locates inher- ent worth in ťteleological centres of life', namely, in anything that lives and possesses interests and goals. It is not relevant whether such an entity is conscious of its goals or not, but only whether it has as its purpose to live, grow and propagate. We are able to know and understand such interests and can therefore make rational decisions about what is 'good' for those entities. This would include all the species involved in the tuna-dolphin debate, from humans through dolphins and turtles to tuna. Ration- ality tells us that humans are not inherently superior, and that all types of creatures are of equal value. There can therefore be no moral justification for imposing a hierarchy of moral significance. Like Singer and Regan, however, Taylor's egalitarian approach to species does not always mean that humans must sacrifice themselves to the needs of other creatures. In particular, we are entitled to value and protect 'the advancement of knowledge, the creation and appreciation of the arts, and many other aspects of civilised life', as well as 'the duty to provide for the freedom, autonomy, and well-being of ourselves and our fellow humans'.96 Conflicts between human inter- ests and those of other living organisms are 'situations of competing moral claims'.97 Taylor suggests a scheme of principles by which these competing interests could be resolved.98 The first is that humans are entitled to act in self-defence, which would arise only in the face of potential death or serious injury and would only justify caus- 89 For the argument that traditional theories are sufficient to answer environmental problems, see J. Passmore, supra, n 29. Rodman, supra, n 72, offers an illuminating discussion of this problem. 90 Another important approach is deep ecology. It goes further than the other theories by proposing a tran- scending identification of the self with the world around us. See, for example, Naess, 'The Shallow and the Deep, Long-Range Ecology Movement: A Summary', Inquiry (1973) 16, 95-100, Naess, 'A Defense of the Deep Ecology Movement', Environmental Ethics (1984) 6, 265-73; Fox, 'Deep Ecology: A New Philosophy of Our Time?', Ecologist (1984) 14, 194-8; G. Sessions (ed), Deep Ecology for the Twenty-First Century (Boston: Shambala, 1995). 91 Goodpaster, supra, n 36; Attfield, supra, n 27; H. Rolston III, Environmental Ethics: Duties to and Values in the Natural World (Philadelphia: Temple UP, 1988). Also N. Agar, 'Biocentrism and the Concept of Life', Ethics (1997) 108, 147-68. 92 This had clear roots in Schweitzer's Christian faith, and is echoed in some speeches in the tuna-dolphin debates. See, for example, Mathias supra, n 58. A related idea was used by one speaker, who described the sacred status of dolphins in Polynesian history and the fact that ancient Polynesians would have rather died of starvation than kill a dolphin. Faleomavaega, supra, n 31. 93 Schweitzer, Civilization and Ethics (London: A. &amp; C. Black, 1923). 94 D.J. Des Jardins, supra, n 27 at 130-2. 95 P.W.

Secondly, proportionality should apply where there is a conflict between a non-basic human interest, such as pleasure or convenience, and a basic interest of another organism, such as food or shelter. In such a case, proportion- ality would suggest that humans exercise restraint. The third principle is the need to cause minimum harm, which applies in particular where non-basic human interests may override basic non-human interests.100 The balancing of these interests would be implemented through the proportionality principle, but conditioned by human thoughts, values and assumptions. Just as in the discussion of virtue ethics above, the concept of an attitude does not give us hard-and-fast rules, even though it provides guidelines and constraints. Taylor suggests several general duties of which the most relevant for the purposes of this discussion are non-maleficence, non-interference, and restitutive justice.101 The first two principles are principles of restraint or moderation, and the third is a positive duty to make amends when the first two have not been, or cannot be, implemented. Those that argued for restraint in human fishing activities were employing similar views, though usually as a result of enlightened anthropocentrism rather than biocentrism. It is relatively hard to find expressions of respect which lie outside these human-based approaches.102 5.2 Ecocentric approaches One of the principles of modern ecological thinking is that natural systems are immensely complex and interactive. We are increasingly aware of our ignorance and of our inability to act so as to obtain precise, predetermined results in biological matters. We are also aware of the same difficulty in achieving predictable results in political and economic affairs. The transboundary nature of most environmental sys- tems and problems, along with the little understood implications of globalisation, exacerbate the difficulty. All of these elements existed in the tuna-dolphin problem and therefore it might have been expected that speakers would have employed eco- centric theories because of their focus on the interdependence of nature. A famous ecocentric statement is that of Leopold in setting out his 'land ethic': A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.103 One might ask, however, to what extent it is possible to determine and apply formal rules to decide what is the right thing to do in the context of ecosystems. It is possible, 99 The MMPA provides for an exception of killing a marine mammal in self-defence. 16 USC § 1371(c). 100 Thus, the speakers who argued against the wasteful killing and unnecessary suffering of dolphins could fall within this approach despite their relative lack of concern for other species such as turtles and tuna, supra, n 60. 101 These are discussed in detail at 169-218. The other principle, which will not be discussed here, is fidelity, which is a general duty not to deceive and betray wild animals. 102 But see Mathias, supra, n 58; Faleomaevega, supra, n 31; Gilchrest, supra, n 41. Moreover Taylor's approach excludes the moral considerability of non-living entities, such as mountains, or non-individual entities, such as species. To the extent that speakers were in favour of protecting individual dolphins against potential extinction of other species, they could be said to follow Taylor's approach. However, this focus on individuals over species can been criticised because it denies the importance of ecological systems and their constituent relationships. 103 A Sand County Almanac (New York: Sierra Club/Ballatine, 1966) at 240.</page><page sequence="18">310 ILONA CHEYNE in a general way at least, to make judgments about whether an ecosystem is func- tioning well. For example, we might expect a healthy ecosystem to support an appro- priate variety of species or demonstrate stability. But there are considerable problems attached to the question of the integrity of an ecosystem.104 An assumption that there should be a natural balance runs the danger of promoting a static model of ecosys- tems, whereas it is evident that change is an inherent part of the way in which species interact and adapt amongst themselves and their outside environment. In addition, ecocentric approaches are vulnerable to the criticism that they focus on ecosystems to the exclusion of individuals.105 As noted above, the purpose of the MMPA was to allow management of marine mammal populations, including regulated taking where necessary for the health of the species as a whole and their ecosystems. In the 1996-97 debates, however, the issue had narrowed down to the welfare of dolphins, and the cost of protecting them from being killed or suffering harassment during commercial fishing operations. In this context, some speakers assigned overriding importance to dolphins and they were prepared to sacrifice turtles as individuals and potentially as species if necessary.106 Others appeared to accept that a certain level of dolphin mortality was accept- able.107 The question for them was the basis on which an appropriate level of deaths could be justified and limited even though the reason was incidental killing rather than population management. Some of this group calculated an acceptable level of dolphin mortality according to its impact on the future viability of dolphin popula- tions. For example, a letter from a group of scientists presented to Congress stated that the permissible level of kills provided for under the Panama Declaration was low enough to allow dolphin populations to grow substantially.108 Another version of this idea was that the deaths of 'an extremely small number of dolphins' were accept- able if this allowed the conservation of tuna stocks, avoided needless bycatch of other species, and complied with international obligations.109 Both of these groups appeared to take an ecocentric view in that human intervention was permissible provided it did not radically upset the existing balance of the biotic community in the ETP, although this could be explained by human prudence in resource conservation rather than by ecocentric reasons as intrinsic value. 104 See Callicott, 'The Value of Ecosystem Health', Environmental Values (1995) 4, 345; Russow, 'Ecosystem Health: An Objective Valuation?', Environmental Values (1995) 4, 363. 105 A famous formulation of this view is Regan's charge that holism is 'environmental fascism' because it subordinates the needs of individuals to those of the community, supra, n 76 at 362. Against this, of course, one can argue that Regan's favouring individuals over species or ecosystems is not ecologically sensible because it suggests that ecosystems must always be sacrificed to the liberty of individuals no matter how destructive they may be. See Rolston, 'Duties to Endangered Species' in Elliot, supra, n 27, 60 at 67-75. 106 Supra, n 78. 107 Bilbray, ibid at H0427-8, Q446: 14s Cong Rec Hsi25-6 (iQQ7) (remarks of Reps Kolbe and Skagers). 100 The limit of 5,000 kills a year would represent 0.1% of the estimated population and, since the mortality rate had already fallen below that level, they considered it to be 'below levels of biological significance' 142 Cong Rec H9437 (1996) (remarks of Rep Bilbray). 109 Ibid. Also 142 Cong Rec H9436 (1996) (remarks of Rep McDermott) (wasteful bycatch is threat to biodiversity). The view was that no irreversible harm should be done to dolphin populations but individual dolphin kills were otherwise ethically acceptable. In particular, the protection of a single species should not take precedence over environmental management of the whole ecosystem. When it was convenient to reach a zero level of mortality, all other things being taken into account, this would be desirable but was not ethically imperative.</page><page sequence="19">LAW AND ETHICS IN THE TRADE AND ENVIRONMENT DEBATE 3II 6. Ranking Human and Non-Human Interests It was noted earlier that the crucial issue in the tuna-dolphin debates was that of ranking the needs and desires of the competing species. This was largely because the strongest argument in favour of a return to dolphin setting was to avoid damage being inflicted on other species. It might have been a relatively simple question had the choice been between the death of dolphins and the death of other animals and fish. It was, however, made more complicated by the fact that some of the other species whose members were being killed in preference to dolphins were endangered, whereas the dolphins at issue were not. That fact alone would have significantly shifted the ethical problems involved. The final complication, however, was that these other species were not being threatened to avoid dolphin mortality (accepting for the time being that dolphin deaths could be effectively prevented by the proposed scheme), but instead to prevent dolphins being subjected to the stress of the chase and encirclement by nets. Where the choice was between the death of dolphins and the death of other species, the lines were fairly clearly drawn. Those who believed that the bycatch problem was insufficiently proven, or that an observer system would be unable to identify all dol- phin deaths, gave a higher value to individual dolphins than to the individuals of other species. In other words, they would prefer to see the death of turtles, sharks and other individual animals or fish rather than the death of a dolphin, at least until they could be convinced that those other species were genuinely endangered. They therefore favoured one species over another, which would constitute speciesism, but could be swayed on an ecocentric basis. The problem of stress caused to dolphins by chase and encirclement was a more difficult issue. One obvious way of ranking these choices was, of course, to decide that capturing dolphins and releasing them would be more desirable than killing high numbers of other species and potentially causing their extinction. The argument would be that limited harm to one species should not be allowed to trump irreversible harm to another.110 However, this view was not universally held. Some of those who accepted that there was a serious problem of bycatch still felt that there was an overriding need to protect the dolphins from the stress. They explicitly placed a higher value on this than on preventing the death of other animals or fish, the poten- tial extinction of other species, or the threat to tuna stocks by the catching of imma- ture tuna. There were two principal reasons put forward. One was that the stress would actually kill dolphins, and even threaten the ability of dolphins to survive as a species. The threat to dolphins was converted into a danger comparable with that facing turtles and tuna, with preference being shown to dolphins. The second reason was that it was cruelty to a species capable of suffering as a result of chase and encirclement. The favouring of dolphins was thus developed beyond the need to sur- vive into the avoidance of suffering that turtles and tuna were not considered to be able to feel, at least to the same degree.111 There was, in any case, an inherent privileging of human interests since no sugges- tion was made that fishing should stop and the only choice considered was which 110 Infra, n 1 12. See, for example, 143 Cong Rec H3128 (1997) (remarks of Rep Bilirakis).</page><page sequence="20">312 ILONA CHEYNE species should suffer as a result of human activity. It was suggested above that envir- onmental theories that try to resolve this question have difficulty in avoiding the charge that they automatically privilege human interests. None of the schools of thought can claim to have succeeded completely. The stewardship tradition requires judgments to be made which will inevitably incorporate human perceptions, values and preferences. Utilitarianism, even when the privileging of one species over another is disallowed, still favours characteristics that are shared by humans and which are assumed to generate a greater capacity to suffer. Rights theory, even when emancip- ated from the need for rationality and reciprocity, shares the same problems as utilit- arianism because it focuses on characteristics such as intelligence and the capacity to experience complex emotions which favour ourselves. Taylor's biocentrism begins with species egalitarianism but eventually allows quite rarefied desires such as the pursuit of knowledge and culture to prevail over the interests of other species. Even ecocentrism relies on human-centred constructions of integrity, stability or beauty. Several potential ways of resolving interspecies conflicts are discussed by VanDe- Veer, from a utilitarian perspective, of which three are particularly helpful.112 One is 'species egalitarianism', which proposes that conflicts of interest should always be resolved in favour of the most pressing need, regardless of the identity of the species holding that interest. This would justify the views of speakers who supported the protection of turtles or tuna from extinction over the mere suffering of dolphins, but not the protection of human preference for eating tuna over the life of turtles or tuna. The second is 'interest sensitive speciesism' which permits human interests to prevail over like, or less urgent, interests of other species, but does not allow peri- pheral human interests to override basic interests of other species. In the tuna- dolphin case, some would argue that tuna need not be harvested or, at the very least, that the advantages of purse seine net fishing over other techniques constituted a peripheral interest; the need to survive of dolphins, turtles or tuna would of course be basic. However, VanDeVeer's third concept changes the priorities. 'Two factor egalitar- ianism' recognises 'serious' interests in addition to 'basic' and 'peripheral' interests. Serious interests are not essential for the holder to live but are more important than mere convenience or pleasure.113 VanDeVeer argues that the capacity of a being to possess 'serious' interests depends on its level of psychological capacity, which of course tends to favour humans automatically over other species and, in this case, dolphins over turtles. It also means that killing for food would become more accept- able the lower the psychological capacity of the animal to be killed. This gradient in the importance of interests, and its essential link with the characteristics of the spe- cies possessing them, gives a convincing explanation of how the conflicting interests in the tuna-dolphin case were evaluated and prioritised.114 For example, one speaker 112 D. VanDeVeer, 'Interspecific Justice', Inquiry (1979) 22, 55-79. He also puts forward two other possible approaches. The first is 'radical speciesism' in which humans have the right to treat other species in any way they choose. The second approach, labelled 'extreme speciesism' accepts that animals have interests but pro- poses that even basic needs of animals may be subordinated to any human interest, including non-essential desires. 113 'Something is in a being's serious interest if and only if, though it can survive without it, it is difficult or costly (to its well-being) to do so.' Ibid at 63. 114 An interesting example of how basic, serious and peripheral human interests were used to justify taking of marine mammals can be seen in the MMPA debates. The exceptions made in favour of native Americans were justified on the grounds of subsistence hunting, protein requirements for health, maintaining traditional</page><page sequence="21">LAW AND ETHICS IN THE TRADE AND ENVIRONMENT DEBATE 313 argued that it was perfectly reasonable that people should not only want jobs exploiting tuna (and incidentally posing a threat to dolphins), but also to have a certain quality of life.115 The basic interests of tuna were unquestioningly subordinated to the peripheral/ serious interests of humans, and the interests of dolphins and turtles weighed against humans and not tuna. However, dolphins were given protection against killing because of the prevailing view that they were highly intelligent animals who exhibited self-awareness, consciousness, and emotions and, in the view of those that assessed their psychological complexity most highly, were also entitled to be protected against harassment by chase and encirclement.116 Individual turtles, on the other hand, did not apparently receive such a high ranking, and their basic interest to survive would have been sacrificed by many speakers to the 'serious' interest of dolphins to avoid stress. 7. Conclusion The Congressional debates represent only one facet of the trade and environment debate. Although partly in response to the GATT panel findings and the fear of a potential, and more serious, WTO panel report,117 the debates also reflect other demands and pressures. They reveal that the relationship between law and ethics is complex and dynamic, and that national law-making, international trade policy and competing ethical theories cannot easily be subsumed within the duality of competi- tion between the interests of trade and the environment. To go further, they throw doubts on the rhetoric of sustainable development which is accepted, both in the Rio Declaration and the preamble to the WTO Agreement, as an overriding policy framework under which the three human goals of environmental protection, eco- nomic welfare (represented here by free-trade policies) and social justice can be har- monised. While as a purely empirical matter the three goals may sometimes be com- binable, they are essentially incommensurable and competing. Examination of the ethical dimension in particular exposes competing conceptions of sustainability which must be explicitly articulated to prevent protagonists at any level of the trade and environment debate talking past each other.118 It also identifies areas where com- promises must be made. Thus, sustainability might refer to 'critical natural capital' of which dolphins, pos- sibly tuna but probably not turtles may be regarded as examples of different forms of human resources. This view at least makes the question of competition with trade concerns susceptible to a rational accommodation. The line taken by the USA could handicrafts for livelihood and as a cultural legacy, and even the cravings for traditional food experienced by native Americans who had moved away from the coastal areas of Alaska. See, for example, 118 Cong Rec S25258-9 (1972) (remarks of Sen Stevens). Thus, he supported the proposed legislation on the grounds, inter alia, that it would 'protect the livelihood of individuals that fished throughout the Pacific Ocean, especially the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, to pay their mortgages and raise their children and have a quality of life and standard of living that all of us would want to achieve'. Gilchrest, supra, n 41. 116 Supra, n 33. 117 Supra, n 5. 118 See, for example, A. Dobson y Justice and the Environment (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1998) ch 2.</page><page sequence="22">314 ILONA CHEYNE be defensible on this basis since arguably the priority given to dolphins did not, in this case, seriously distort international trade. Sustainability might also lean against irreversible harm which, although still geared to human interests, would raise the ranking of turtles and would throw greater doubt on US policy. Finally, sustainability might refer to non-anthropocentric concern with inherent value, in which case the ranking of the species involved and the concern with trade rules would invoke the full range of ethical perspectives and approach the point of incommensurability.119 However, the Congressional debates show that the value placed on dolphins was anthropocentric in every respect. In VanDeVeer's terms, the ranking order appears to be as follows: serious human interests, serious dolphin interests, basic turtle inter- ests, with tuna coming nowhere. The competition between humans, dolphins and turtles was structured primarily in terms of competing human interests, namely between economic concerns and the enlightened anthropocentrism represented by the concept of stewardship. This was manifested by heavy reliance on the alleged human-like qualities of the dolphin, including intelligence, gentleness, beauty, humour and ability to communicate. Thus the interests of other species were con- ceived as anthropomorphic. There are obvious problems in adopting even enlightened anthropocentric reasons when making decisions that are intended to protect the environment. Policies may be short-lived if human preferences change, or it turns out that human interests are affected detrimentally. There is also the risk of ignoring the value of species with which we have little or no affinity. The special status granted to dolphins and their subsequent privileging over more threatened species is especially problematic in the light of the emerging doubts over whether dolphins are in fact particularly intelligent, friendly or helpful to humans. It reminds us that the extent and accuracy of our knowledge must always be questioned. As to evidence of the application of ethical theories, most evident was the assump- tion held by most speakers of a right to exploit the resources of the sea, even if it involved incidental killing of dolphins and turtles. The most straightforward solution, that of banning purse seine net fishing altogether, was not seriously suggested in the debates.120 Utilitarianism was a dominant theme in the debates and could explain why individual dolphins were given greater protection over individual turtles or tuna because of its emphasis on the capacity to suffer. The limitations of utilitarianism as an environmental ethic may be illustrated by the arguments urged by some speakers in favour of preventing dolphins being exposed to the stress of chase and netting even if the consequence was the potential extinction of 'lower' species.121 119 Although outside the direct concerns of this paper, the debates also raise the question of whether values, for example those associated with freedom of trade or natural resources, are universal or culturally specific. The ideology of free trade assumes the former but the concessions made by the US in favour of particular groups with a strong cultural concern on tuna fishing (supra, nil) raises questions which were not fully brought out in the Congressional debates. Related to this, although ethical rhetoric is discernible in the Congressional debates, distinctions between universal ethical and other policy claims, and between localised political and factual arguments, can only be made with difficulty. Even explicitly ethical arguments can easily be suspected of disguising other policy motives. The question then arises whether in a situation containing multiple political objectives, in this case environmental protection and trade protectionism, is it legitimate (or ethical) to do the right thing for a wrong reason or should evidence of an ulterior localised purpose invalidate a claim? 120 But see K.L. Stewart, supra, n 3 at 136. 121 It is worth noting, however, that the concept of cruelty was not used in the final legislation, which uses instead a test of killing or significant adverse damage to the dolphins as a species.</page><page sequence="23">LAW AND ETHICS IN THE TRADE AND ENVIRONMENT DEBATE 315 It is perhaps surprising that deontological arguments were not more prominently used in the tuna-dolphin discussions. They were more evident in the context of dis- cussing management strategies in the original MMPA debates, where it was claimed that humans had a responsibility and duty to conserve and sustain marine mammal populations. In the tuna-dolphin debates themselves, however, the main indications of a rights-based approach lay in the greater significance given to dolphins' intelli- gence and psychological complexity, which echoes Regan's SOAL test, and the assumption of the role of representative on behalf of dolphins by at least one speaker. Elements of a virtue ethics approach can be detected in the speeches, including some expressions of respect for individual life (although only where dolphins were concerned). Virtue ethics may also be seen in the common repudiation of the waste- fulness of the dolphins' deaths and suffering, although this became weaker when the alternative was causing the deaths of endangered species. Moreover, the virtue approach to waste was strictly limited. It was not suggested seriously that purse seine fishing itself was the problem and that it was too destructive, too encompassing to be ethically acceptable. The wastefulness of dolphin deaths was a significant issue only when there were convenient alternatives available. The idea that 'serious inter- ests' held by psychologically complex beings can trump even basic interests of other, less complex species seems be the cause of favouring human interests here. The concept of serious interests also helps to explain how dolphins were ranked over other species. Those that defended the dolphins most vigorously ranked their interests not to be killed or stressed more highly than the turtles' interests not to be killed. Two strategies were adopted. Some, contrary to the precautionary principle, argued that the evidence of potential turtle extinction was unconvincing or insuffi- cient, and that the dolphins should not be put at risk until more knowledge was acquired. The other strategy, which shaped the final legislation, was a compromise. It accepted that avoiding dolphin stress could not automatically rank above the poten- tial extinction of a species, and therefore that dolphin setting could be defined as dolphin-safe provided that no dolphin deaths were observed. However, the 1997 Act shifted the weight back in favour of the dolphins by the condition that dolphin setting would have to wait until further studies had been completed and only allowed to resume if there was no evidence that serious harm would result to dolphins as a species. It shows that dolphins as a species were ultimately still ranked above turtles as a species - a result which can only be explained on the basis of recognising dolphins as having a special status by virtue of their perceived closeness to human beings. What appears from this analysis is a lack of clarity and openness in ethical thought and argument, contrary to what we might expect and hope for in the conduct of policy debate in important environmental matters. We should, it seems, accept that environmental decisions will favour human interests because it appears to be imposs- ible to separate human values from our assessment of the interests of other species and ecosystems. However, the virtue ethics approach offers a framework of analysis which depends on rationality and good faith, and promotes principles of moderation such as proportionality, avoidance of waste and the precautionary principle. There is no prescription for how these principles might be applied in every case, but no coherent policy response to the kind of challenge posed by the international trade rules, such as in the tuna-dolphin conflict, is possible unless the ethical approaches that are adopted are made explicit and their contradictions and similarit-</page><page sequence="24">3I6 ILONA CHEYNE ies carefully explored and understood. Without that coherence, trade measures designed to pursue environmental polices are much more susceptible to the argument that they not only constitute interference with the rights and expectations of other countries, but that they are unpredictable. Their unilateral nature not only gives rise to the accusation that they are culturally specific in their values, but can also be challenged on the grounds that those values have no internal consistency. As a result, the arguments that such trade measures are merely a disguise for trade protectionism or that they threaten the stability of agreed international trade rules become all the stronger. To paraphrase Berlin, when environmental policy-making is in conflict with international trade rules it must justify itself as part of a rational process of adjusting the unadjustable, and the best justification must include a coherent and explicit eth- ical framework.122 122 Supra, n 1.</page></plain_text>
