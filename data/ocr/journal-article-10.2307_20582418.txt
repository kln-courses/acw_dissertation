<plain_text><page sequence="1">P O E- T R Y: A Magazine of Verse A NINETEENTH-CENTURY IMAGIST The Poetry of Dorothy Wordsworth, edited from the Journals by Hyman Eigerman. Columbia University Press. In The Second Common Reader Virginia Woolf says of Dor othy Wordsworth: "One feels the suggestive power which is the gift of the poet rather than of the naturalist." Mr. Eigerman gives convincing verification to this statement. The "poetry" of Dorothy Wordsworth is at once so clear and accurate in its imagery, so void of devices and didacticism, that in some ways she is more readable today than her famous brother. She has no conflict or thesis to expound. Her conception of nature, though often anthropomorphic, is never pantheistic. Between her feelings and the pen nothing has been added or subtracted. This extreme naivete makes her random observa tions startlingly alive: He had no hat on, And only had a grey plaid wrapped about him. It is nothing to describe, But on a bare moor, Alone with his sheep, Standing as he did In utter quietness And silence.... A straightforward use of the English language, an absence of all self-consciousness or elaboration, make the reading of these prose-poetry selections a satisfying if somewhat rarified experi ence. Every word is aimed squarely at the object and every figure is inseparable from the image. The rustic life seldom becomes sentimental in her hands, because she never makes judgments. She is forever the observer, economical and precise. But this precision is not always poetry, or even imaginative prose. Mr. Eigerman is more than a little deluded by his en 280</page><page sequence="2">A Nineteenth-century Imagist thusiasm when he devotes an entire page to: I saw a robin Chasing a scarlet butterfly. Several other indusions are equally pointless. Some of the selections, with too much prose rhythm and prose thought, are decidedly uncomfortable in their new form. On the whole, how ever, Mr. Eigerman has given an adequate, though sometimes uncritical, treatment of the peculiar beauty in Dorothy Words worth's Journals. She is not unique and she is not great. But she is one of the few in the large army of naturalist-poets who could occasionally see nature, not only with much devotion and much accuracy, but with equal artistry.
