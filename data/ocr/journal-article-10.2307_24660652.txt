None of these discourses are sufficient. This last book revolves then around the idea of an insufficient (not enough) response. The idea of an insufficient response is not restricted to the problem of animal suffering; it extends to what we must call, following Der rida, "the problem of the worst." The worst is the end, in the sense of total violence or total sui cide: apocalypse. In this essay, I have tried to construct the beginnings of a more sufficient response that urges us to move toward the least amount of violence towards all living beings, while recognizing nevertheless that even this response is not sufficient. The more sufficient response is based on Derridas transformation of the concept of waiting into being late found in Aporias. This transformation is at the heart of Derridas thought of the messianic. We are so late in relation to the problem of the apocalypse that we can no longer wait for someone else to come and save us. We are so late that we—there's no one else coming—must take action now.

None of these discourses are sufficient. This last book revolves therefore around the idea of an insufficient (not enough) response. The idea of an insufficient response is not restricted to the problem of animal suffering; it extends to what we must call, following Derrida, "the prob lem of the worst."2 Quite simply, the worst is the end, in the sense of total violence or total suicide. But the problem of the worst is more complicated, and it is a problem found not only in Derrida but also in Deleuze and Guattari.3 While the worst alludes to the old problem of the theodicy (the best possible world as in Leibniz), we must say that the problem of the worst does not consist in the worst possible world. It consists rather in the loss of the world itself. Here we could quote Deleuze and Guattari from their 1991 What is Philosophy? (and we should make the association to Proust: in search of lost time): "We have lost the world, which is worse than losing a fiancée, a son, or a God."4 Or, we could quote Derrida writing about Paul Celan in his 2003 Rams, "the world is gone, I must carry you."5 The world, the second world, the world in itself or essential world is gone, lost, leaving only this world.6 And yet, this world is cracked, fragmented, with borders everywhere. The problem of the worst arises then because what defines a crack, a fragment, a border, or a limit is essential divisi bility. The divisibility of the limit exceeds everyone's power. The worst then is a problem that arises as a reaction to powerlessness and impotence (impuissance):7 I am unable to keep the limit closed and stop entrance (Derrida), and I am 21 See "Foi et savoir," in La Religion, ed.

Lawlor / Research in Phenomenology 38 (2008) 392—403 unable to open the border and exit (Deleuze). This formula gives us two ver sions of the powerlessness in the face of the essential divisibility of the limit (two versions that are probably reversible): the inability to stop openness (the door opens and entrance occurs) and the inability to stop closure (the door closes and capture occurs). From the two versions, let us look at the inability of entrance first. We can see how the problem of the worst comes about. The worst occurs when I cannot keep all the others from entering in, when I am too weak to protect myself from all of those who might contaminate me, and then I react—this immediate reaction is precisely the worst one—by sending all of them outside to such a degree that I kill them and myself, all of us. The worst is the suicide of all, of everyone and everything, the whole world (tout le monde, to use the French idiom).8 Here we can provide a second meaning to the loss of the world: "pure self-destruction."9 As in Derrida, whose terms ("contamina tion," for instance) we were just using to formulate the problem, the worst in Deleuze (or in Deleuze and Guattari) arises from the essential divisibility of the limit. But here in Deleuze, in contrast to Derrida, but not in opposition to him, the worst occurs when I cannot get out. Now, with Deleuze we turn to the other version of the formula of the powerlessness in the face of the essential divisibility of the limit: the inability to exit. The worst, in this case, occurs when I cannot escape through the holes that others stop up·, and then I react—this immediate reaction is precisely the worst one—by pulling all the others toward the inside to such a degree that I kill them and myself. The worst occurs when there is total capture or no way out.10 But in either case, with either Derrida or Deleuze, the worst defines all the others as "the enemy"; "the enemy" is a gen eral name; the definite article, "the," makes no distinctions and treats all the others the same, "the unspecified enemy" as Deleuze and Guattari would say." To say this again, the problem of the worst treats all the others as the enemy and the problem is really the fact that we react by trying to destroy all of them, the whole world, including ourselves. 8) Here we could raise the exemplary problem of what defines a person who takes his or her own life in order to take the lives of others: suicide bomber or martyr? But the worst is worse than a suicide bomber.

Lawlor / Research in Phenomenology 38 (2008) 392-403 395 Now, in this essay, I have tried to construct the beginnings of a response that urges us to move toward the least amount of violence towards all the oth ers, toward all living beings. While one could construct a response based on Deleuze and Guattari's work, here I am going to use Derrida. More specifi cally, this response is based on Derrida's transformation of the concept of wait ing into being late found in Aporias,n This transformation is at the heart of Derrida's thought of the messianic. For instance in Specters of Marx, Derrida says, "The messianic, including its revolutionary forms (and the messianic is always revolutionary, it has to be), would be urgency, imminence but, irreduc ible paradox, a waiting without the horizon of waiting."13 And if Derrida's thought of the messianic does not sound like Deleuze or like Deleuze and Guattari, we should recall not only how often they call for an earth to come, for a people to come (an à venir that belongs to the consistency of the devenir), but also this statement from A Thousand Plateaus·. "The Body without organs, we do not get to it [on n'y arrive pas], we cannot get to it [on ne peut pas y arriver], we have never finished with gaining access to it, it is a limit... it awaits you [il vous attend]."14 I. The Context and Implications of Aporias If you are familiar with Derrida's writings on Heidegger, you know already that, on the one hand, Derrida—this is found in Of Spirit—focuses on the idea of privation that Heidegger suggests when he proposes, in Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics, that animals are "poor in world." On the other hand, Derrida—this is found in "Geschlecht I"—focuses on the phrase we find early in What is called Thinking.?: an "abyss of essence" separates the ape's prehensile organ from the human hand. In these two focal points we have the poles with which any discourse on the human-animal relation must negotiate (or the relation between self and other). The idea of poverty implies that there is only a difference of degree (poor in world, rich in world) between humans and animals; this idea is a sort of continuism. Yet, the "abyss of essence" phrase suggests a substantial difference between humans and animals; this idea is a 121 Jacques Derrida, Apories (Paris: Galilée, 1996); translated by Thomas Dutoit as Aporias (Stan ford: Stanford University Press, 1993).

Lawlor / Research in Phenomenology 38 (2008) 392-403 sort of separationism. In order to negotiate with these two poles, Derrida (in Of Spirit) speaks of "a staggered analogy" (une analogie décalée).15 To be straightforward and not to equivocate, I would say that this analogy (even though it is staggered) leans more toward the pole of continuism (or even anthropomorphism). But the difficulty of the analogy really lies in what in humans or in human existence (Dasein) gets analogized to animal life. In other words, the difficulty lies in what property gets transferred from human existence to animal life. In L'animal que donc je suis, Derrida argues that what has traditionally separated humans from animals is the thesis that humans undergo a fall or are weak— our nakedness at birth indicates this weakness—and yet it is precisely this weakness that allows us to be superior to animals.16 Our weakness and there fore our consciousness of death—in a word, our awareness that finitude is what most properly defines us—is what allows us to dominate animals. Inso far as we humans have access to the "as such," that is, the essence, of death, we have access to the "as such" or essence of things. In contrast, because they lack this access to the "as such" of death and therefore to the "as such" of essence, animals cannot think, cannot do philosophy, and—if we stress the idea of essence—the animals cannot do phenomenology. Let us sharpen this thesis about the difference from and superiority of human existence over animal life a bit. What defines man is an awareness of death as such, that is, death as the possibility that is most proper to human existence or most one's own. What defines man is this specific kind of self relation or auto-affection: I am affected by death, but death is what is most my own, the same as me: auto. We know that this kind of auto-affection means that human existence is finite, and again, it is this finitude that seems to be what allows us to be superior to animal life. But, it is possible to argue that this awareness of death as what is most one's own means is constructed on a kind of auto-affection where death is "hetero" to the "auto." "This is an important transition: then, the death that affects us is not proper, is not dis closed in its truth, as such, in the mood of anxiety. What defines man is a fault (une fauté) in the "auto" of the auto-affection, and this fault is worse than the one into which traditionally we have fallen. If there is this faulty impropriety in the auto-affection, if human existence does not have access to the "as such" of death, then, it seems, we cannot say human existence has 151 Derrida, De l'esprit (Paris: Galilée, 1987), 81; translated by Geoff Bennington and Rachel Bowlby as Of Spirit (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1989), 51. 161 Derrida, L'animal que donc je suis, 133.</page><page sequence="6">L. Lawlor / Research in Phenomenology 38 (2008) 392—403 397 access to the "as such" of essence. Here we can see again the difficulty of the staggered analogy. We are not transferring a positive property of man to ani mals; we are not saying that animals speak just as humans do. We are trying to show that humans do not have the power to have access to the "as such" of essence. What is being transferred to the animals is this precise lack or a pri vation. If human auto-affection is always and necessarily contaminated by hetero-affection, then we humans lack proper auto-affection, and it is pre cisely this lack in auto-affection that is being transferred to animal life. The very weakness in us is extended to animal life, making them weak and even evil; they are no longer pure mechanisms. Here, we could quote Deleuze (with Guattari) from What is Philosophy?: "we become animal in order that animals become something else."17 In any case, with this problem of auto-affection and death, you recognize of course that we are very close to Heidegger's Being and Time conception of being towards death, the conception that Derrida criticizes in "S'attendre (à) l'arrivée," "Awaiting at the Arrival," the second essay found in Aporias. Now, what I have just done is set up a context within which we can now examine the logic Derrida wields in this second essay. The context is the human-animal relation. Is it possible to separate human existence from animal life by means of a specific kind of auto-affection in which we (as humans) are aware of or have access to death as such? Or are we more like animals insofar as we do not have access to death as such? And if we do not have access to the "as such" of death, can we as human existence claim to have access to the "as such" of essence? In order to stress the implications of these questions, let me quote the last line of L'animal que donc je suis: "The stakes naturally—I'm not hiding this—are so radical that what is at issue is the ontological difference,' the 'question' of being,' the whole structure of Heidegger's discourse."18 But, I think that we have to see even farther ranging implications of these questions and the argumentation found in "Awaiting (at) the Arrival." If we are more like animals, if we suffer this weakness of the "hetero" in the "auto" just as animals do, is it not the case that animals must be treated as we are treated, in a way that alleviates the suffering? If there is such suffering in the world, then we cannot wait for help. Waiting cannot be an alibi; waiting must be identi fied with speaking out and doing.

Lawlor / Research in Phenomenology 38 (2008) 392—403 II. Daseiti Stands before Itself (The Privation of the "As Such" of Death) So, let us turn to the argumentation found in the second essay of Aporias. It seems to me that the argumentation that Derrida uses in "Awaiting (at) the Arrival" ("S'attendre à l'arrivée")'9 targets the transcendental architectonic of Beingand Time·, Derrida says, "[Heidegger's] order of order [that is, the method Heidegger follows in Beingand Time] belongs to the great ontological-juridico transcendental tradition, and I believe it is undeniable, impossible to disman tle [indémontable], and invulnerable (at least this is the hypothesis that I am following here)—except [sauf] perhaps in this particular case called death." The uniqueness of the case of death, as Derrida is going to show, "excludes it from the system of possibilities and specifically from the order that it may, in turn, condition" (AT 86-87/45; my emphasis). The word "possibility" in this quote is very important. As we have already stressed, the result of the disman tling will not be that now we have to say that animals have access to death as such. Rather, what Derrida is trying to show is that humans, as Dasein, like animals, do not have that access either. The weight of Heidegger's structure for Derrida bears upon the ontological difference between Dasein s being and Vorhandenbeit and Zuhandenheit (pres ent-at-hand and ready-to-hand, as we say in English). Derrida points out that, in Being and Time, paragraph 49, Heidegger claims that all of the anthropo logical or biological ways of interpreting death forget the essence of Dasein. The essence of Dasein as a being, its proper being, is precisely possibility, the being-possible: Moglichkeit. The idea of possibility—and the composition of this idea is crucial for Derrida—"brings together on the one hand [my empha sis] the sense of the virtuality or of the imminence of the future, of the 'that can always happen [arriver] at any instant,' it is necessary to expect it, I am expecting it, we are expecting it [il faut s'y attendre, je m'y attends, nous nous y attendons; Derrida's emphasis] and on the other hand [my emphasis] the sense of ability, of the possible as that of which I am capable, that for which I have the power [puissance], the ability (pouvoir] or the potentiality" (ΑΡ 113/62). In short, Moglichkeit has two senses: imminence and ability.20 On the basis of these two senses of possibility, Derrida extracts from Being and Time "two typical ontological statements" concerning possibility, but these two statements I9) See also Dennis Keenan's excellent reading of "Awaiting (at) the Arrival" in The Question of Sacrifice (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2005), 140—46. 201 We can now define a weak force: an ability to be unable to stop the event that is imminent from happening.</page><page sequence="8">L. Lawlor / Research in Phenomerwlogy 38 (2008) 392—403 399 are inseparable, forming "a single," as Derrida says, "aporetic sentence" {AP 115/64). Here is the first ontological statement. Death is not just a possibility for Dasein·, it is Dasein's most proper possibility·, in other words, the possibility of death defines what most belongs to Dasein, what Dasein most owns. Derrida stresses the following passage from paragraph 50: "Death is a possibility-of being that Dasein itself has to take over in every case [zu ubernehmen·. with the verb nehmen, "take," we are not very far from the problem of the hand; but let us continue with the quote]. With death, Dasein stands before itself [steht sich... bevor] in its own potentiality for being' (p. 250)" (AP 115-16/64; my emphasis in the Heidegger quote).21 This quote makes use of the Macquar rie-Robinson English translation of Being and Time that renders steht sich bevor as "stands before itself."22 Derrida however renders steht sich bevor by means of the French verb s'attendre. There are three ways of interpreting the French reflexive verb s'attendre, according to Derrida. First, there can be a reflexive construction with no object, in which case I await myself: one simply awaits oneself [on s'attend soi-même). This interpretation is tautological·, Dasein awaits itself as waiting for the possibility that is most its own, the same as itself. But, then second, we can add an object to the sentence, which requires a prep osition, the à, or the "to." Then we have transitivity, which relates the waiting to something else, to the other, which brings us to what might happen, to what Derrida here calls the arrivant [AP 117/65). This interpretation is hetero logical. Dasein awaits itself but this "itself" is, in the second interpretation, other than itself. This composition of same and other brings us to the third interpretation, which associates the tautological with the heterological. The verb s'attendre can be interpreted as both transitive and reflexive: "wait for each other" (s'attendre l'un l'autre). This construction amounts to a kind of double transitivity (to oneself and to the other). But, the construction is even more heterological when the waiting for each other is related to death {AP 117/65). Even though death is what most defines Dasein's propriety, it is always other since this "what can always happen or arrive" takes what is most one's own away. It takes all possibilities away. 211 See Martin Heidegger, Sein undZeit, 16th ed. (Tubingen: Max Niemeyer, 1986), 250; trans lated by John Macquarie and Edward Robinson as Being and Time (New York: Harper and Row, 1962), 294. 221 Stambaugh's English translation also renders steht bevor as "stands before" (Heidegger, Being and Time [Albany: State University of New York Press, 1996], 232).</page><page sequence="9">400 L. Lawlor / Research in Phenomenology 38 (2008) 392—403 But in order to understand really the heterological nature of the construc tion, we must return to Heidegger's German preposition bevor. As in Eng lish—and here Derrida explicitly quotes the Macquarrie-Robinson English translation of Being and Time (AP 119/66)—this preposition can have a tem poral sense and a spatial sense. In fact, Derrida splits the two senses into two French prepositions, avant (which is temporal) and devant (which is spatial). If in death I am "standing before myself," then "before" is devant, which implies some distance from myself, myself as another; as in "standing before a mirror" {AP 119/66), the other then is over there; death is over there.23 Passing now to the temporal sense of the preposition, we can say that, in death, I stand "before" myself, avant, earlier, which means that I, me myself, am already out there at the limit of death. If I am already out there, over there and not here, then I have already, earlier, died. If I have already died, then my waiting for myself is late, or, more precisely, later; I've missed my rendezvous. "The sim plest way to understand this lateness is to recognize that, if what most properly defines me is the possibility of death, then what I am most fundamentally is a process of dying. From the very first moment, as soon as I have taken the very first breath or the very first heartbeat, I have the possibility of dying, of suf focating or having a heart attack, which means that, in a sense, I have already died, which means that my death is always already in the past. My death is what I find myself with from the very first moment. Or, we can think about the lateness in the following way. The lateness is an essential necessity, when what I am waiting for is my death: if I made the rendezvous, then I would be dead, and I would therefore no longer be there, and I would miss the rendez vous; or if I am still alive and still here, then I am not there, not dead, and once again the rendezvous has been missed. In short, Dasein's standing before itself in death makes the simultaneity of the one and the other be impossible. As Derrida says, "Death is ultimately the name of the impossible simultaneity and of an impossibility that we know simultaneously, at which we await for each other however together, at the same time, ama as one says in Greek: at the same time, simultaneously, we wait for each other at this anachrony.. {AP 117-118/65). The first ontological statement therefore concerns lateness or anachrony (which means non-simultaneity). The second concerns the "as such" of death. So, let us now pass to the second ontological statement concerning possibil ity that Derrida extracts from Being and Time. In paragraph 50, Heidegger ultimately says that death is for Dasein the possibility of an impossibility. As There is, as Derrida would say, espacement.</page><page sequence="10">L. Lawlor / Research in Phenomenology 38 (2008) 392^i03 401 Derrida says, this "nuclear proposition" is frequently cited, but the question is, where do we situate it: in the possibility of an impossibility or the impossibility of a possibility? (AP 121/68). Heidegger first describes the impossibility as "the possibility of no longer being able to be there" (Sein und Zeit, paragraph 50, p. 250). This is indeed the possibility of no longer being able, but not the impossibility of a being able to. We are very close to Derrida's own thinking. Derrida says, "The nuance is thin, but its very fragility is what seems to me both decisive and significant, and it is probably most essential in Heidegger's view. Death, the most proper possibility of Dasein, is the possibility of a being able-no-longer-to-be-there or of a no longer being able to be there as Dasein" (AP 122/68). Heidegger, for Derrida, seems to be speaking of an ability to be unable or an inability to be able. We come now to an important transition in the analysis. In paragraph 52, however, Heidegger opens the question of truth because of the everyday cer tainty of death. The association we need to make here is to truth as certainty. Now, according to Derrida, Heidegger seems to see in the contradiction between possibility and impossibility the condition of truth, its very unveil ing, where truth is no longer measured in terms of the logical form of the judg ment (AP 124/70), where it is no longer measured by certainty, where truth is originary truth, aletheia. The question of truth as unconcealment (aletheia) takes us into the question of the "as such." Derrida turns to paragraph 53, where Heidegger says: "The nearest nearness of being-towards-death as possi bility is as far removed as possible from anything real [ Wirklichen]. The more clearly this possibility is understood, the more purely does understanding pen etrate it as [als] the possibility of the impossibility of existence [Existenz] in general" (Sein und Zeit, 262; my emphasis of as). Derrida comments on each of these two sentences in turn. The first sentence, as we just saw, concerns the relation between death and actuality or reality (Wirklichkeit). It means that death is what is closest to us; we have the absolute proximity of death. But death is also as far away as possible and as far away as possible from any actual reality; therefore death is not a possibility that modifies an actual reality; it is not the possibility of something. If it does not give us something to actualize, then death must be thought of as the possibility of something that is not real, of something that is impossible, as the possibility of an impossible. The pos sibility of death therefore exceeds the standard relation of potentiality and actuality. But then, Derrida turns to the second sentence, which concerns understanding; he says, "in the [second] sentence, the figure of unveiling, that is, the truth of this syntax, makes the impossible be, in the genitive form, the complement of the noun or the aporetic supplement of the possible (possibility</page><page sequence="11">402 L. Lawlor / Research in Phenomenology 38 (2008) 392-403 of the impossible), but also [my emphasis] the manifestation of the possible as impossible, the 'as' (the 'als') becoming the enigmatic figure of this monstrous coupling" {AP 124/70). The als in the second sentence means that the possi bility is understood, that is, both unveiled and penetrated as impossibility. It is possibility as impossibility, the proper possibility of Dasein as its proper impossibility.24 For Derrida, and this is crucial: if possibility is what most properly defines Dasein's being—Dasein is not Vorhandenheit or Zuhanden heit, nor is Dasein an animal—then Dasein s proper possibility as im-possibil ity, proper possibility as the negation of Dasein's proper possibility, this as makes death be Dasein's "least proper" possibility {AP 125/71). This is an important quote; Derrida says, The als (as, considered as) keeps in reserve the most unthinkable but it is not yet the als solche (as such): we will have to ask ourselves how a most proper possibility as impossibility can still speak as such without immediately disappearing, without the 'as such' already sink ing beforehand and without its essential disappearance making Dasein lose everything that distinguished it—both from other forms of entities and even from the living animal in general, from the beast. And without its properly dying being, originarily contaminated and parasited by the perishing and the demising. (AP 125-26/71) The question we must ask now is obvious: if Dasein does not have access to the "as such" of death, if Dasein has access to its most proper possibility only as mediated by the "as" of impossibility, then is Dasein's hand separated by "an abyss of essence" from the ape's prehensile organ? III. Conclusion: Waiting and Lateness We have just examined Derrida's interpretation of Heidegger's phrase Dasein steht bevorsich from "Awaiting (at) the Arrival." This phrase concerns standing before oneself in death. Derrida translates the sich stehen in terms of the French reflexive verb s'attendre, and he stresses both the spatial sense and the temporal sense of the German preposition bevor. The preposition means that, in death, I stand "before" myself, earlier, which means that I, me myself, am already out there at the limit of death. If I am already out there, over there and not here, then I have already, earlier, died. If I have already died, then my waiting for myself is late; I have missed my rendezvous. With this interpretation, there 241 For another discussion of Derrida's interpretation of this als, see François RafFoul, "Derrida and the Ethics of the Im-possib!e," Research in Phenomenology 38, no. 2 (2008): 270-90.</page><page sequence="12">L. Lawlor / Research in Phenomenology 38 (2008) 392-403 403 fore, Derrida has transformed the concept of waiting into one of lateness. Derrida has transformed the memory of waiting—I remembered my appoint ment—into forgetting—I am late because I forgot my appointment. I forgot but I just remembered, which means that I am in a hurry, running to catch up, in a word, following. Following, as in l'animal que donc je suis, as in "the ani mal that therefore I am following," means running to catch up. The animals that therefore I follow are animals which I am urgently trying to reach. Their suffering must be relieved right now. No excuse is possible. This transformation of waiting into lateness is at the heart of Derrida's thought of the messianic. It means that, being late, waiting has no alibi. Because you are late, there really is no waiting. We are so late in relation to the problem of the worst, the apocalypse—is "apocalypse" the word that we must use in relation to "global warming"?—that we can no longer wait for someone else to come and save us. We are so late that we—there is no one else com ing—must take action now. We must no longer wait for the people to come. We must become the people to come.25 251 The response to the problem of the worst that I am sketching here at the end is developed in more detail in my This is not Sufficient: An Essay on Animality and Human Nature (New York: Columbia University Press, 2007) and in a book under way to be called Never Will There Be Enough Done: An Essay on the Problem of the Worst in Deleuze and Guattari.</page></plain_text>
