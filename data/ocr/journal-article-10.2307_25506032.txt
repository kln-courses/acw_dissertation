Lough Gur, Co. Limerick (about twelve miles south of Limerick City) is a small lake set in a group of limestone hills. The area is rich in field antiquities and is notable also for the numerous finds of prehistoric objects which were discovered there? especially after the lowering of the lake level by drainage in the nineteenth century. A large number of sites excavated in the Lough Gur neighbourhood since 1936' are of various types and their range of date extends from Neolithic to early modern times. These different indications demonstrate the continued popularity of the district for settlement during the prehistoric period and later. The sites dealt with in this paper are on Knockadoon, the peninsula in the lake, and are the dwelling places of the Neolithic and Bronze Age inhabitants. It is clear that geological and other environmental factors were of great attraction to the first (Neolithic) farmers who settled here. While some of the sites were occupied for a short period only, others show continued occupation down to the Middle Bronze Age. These represent the only group of house-sites of this early date excavated in Ireland and they provide a valuable accompaniment to the knowledge obtained from the study and excavation of contemporary ritual and burial places. The amount of material is large and provides a basis for discussion of the economy and cultural contacts of these early inhabitants at Lough Gur. In particular the pottery, which occurs in great profusion, shows a sequence of style from the Neolithic well into the Bronze Age, thus providing a collection of wares of this date not equalled on any other Irish site and of great significance for its chronological implications.</page><page sequence="3">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 299 Introduction. The discovery of a series of early house-sites on Knockadoon, Lough Gur, Co. Limerick was due in the first instance to excavations conducted there in 1939. During the previous two summers, excavations had been carried out on the stone forts on Carraig Aille,1 the hill to the east of the lake. These forts dated to Early Christian times, eighth to tenth centuries. Attached to one of them (Carraig Aille II) was a complex of rectangular houses and conjoined enclosures. When, in 1939, we noted a rectangular house (Site A, below) on the southern slope of Knockadoon (Pis. XIII, XIV), we believed it likely that it would prove contemporary with the Carraig Aille houses since the surface indications before excavation were not materially different. We were therefore surprised when Site A yielded Neolithic material, and it was decided that other habitation sites on Knockadoon should be investigated. This paper sets out the results of these excavations. The sites will in general be dealt with in the order in which they were excavated; an exception to this m Site C, 1949, which is inserted after Site C, 1940, because its excavation was essentially a continuation of work on the latter site, though the other sites which follow in the paper had in fact been excavated before 1949. Each site is designated by a letter; it must be noted that these letters are independent of those used by Windle2 to designate the stone circles and other remains in the Lough Gur area (PI. XII). In fact none of the sites here described had been previously noted by any writer nor had they been recorded in the Ordnance Map. Each excavated site is dealt with individually, the excavation being described and then the finds. Some discussion of structure and finds is inserted where appropriate; a discussion on the pottery sequence follows the description of the pottery from Site C, 1940. General discussion of the whole group of habitation sites and of the material will be found at the end of the paper. SITE A. Before excavation the outline of the rectangular house could be distinguished by reason of the appearance above the turf of the tops of the stones which marked the position of the walls. The hill sloped to the south and the long axis of the house ran north-south so that the southern end was about 2f lower than the northern end. i P.B.I.A., mC (1949), 39. 2 P.R.I.A., 30 C (1912), 383.

An area 48' by 32'3 was excavated ; thus the whole of the area of the house was uncovered as well as a strip, average width 4', outside the walls (Fig. 1). It was found that the wall-stones were practically continuous on all sides of the house, the only break of importance being that at the south-west corner. The stones did not anywhere provide a wall-face but were placed so as to form an irregular line, in places of single large stones, elsewhere of smaller stones piled together (PI. XV : a). In several instances the larger stones were packed underneath with smaller stones to steady and support them. Some of the large stones rested directly on the clay while others had humus under them, possibly because turf had been used to provide support. Inside the walls the depth of humus was greater than on the outside and varied from about 8" to 1'. The surface of the clay within the walls was hard and had the character of a clay floor. It is marked "clay floor" on the sections but was evidently due to incidental trampling rather than to deliberate puddling of the surface or the laying of a formal floor. This hard clay surface dipped somewhat south of the middle of the house and in the slight hollow so formed a darker deposit was noted? evidently the result of an accumulation of habitation refuse in this area (see N-S section). The middle portion of the southern end of the house was paved (PI. XV : b) but as the paving stones rested in part on this darker deposit they appear to have been put in during the occupation of the house. In any case the hard clay surface was continuous here and this also suggests that habitation had effect before the placing of the pavement, which served to give a level area here and to counteract the slope of the hill and the slight dip in the clay. It is likely that a greater area had originally been paved than that represented by the small amount of paving which remained. A total of forty-one post-holes came to light. In many cases these could only be found after the clay surface had been allowed to dry, but when found it was possible to empty them of their filling and thus to ascertain their diameters and depths with confidence. None can have held a heavy post, the usual diameter being about 7", while the depths varied between 5" and 10". A few of the post-holes were stone packed. The post-holes tended to lie along straight lines, both north-south and east-west. Thus the interior of the house was divided along the length by two lines of posts, each about four feet from the central axis. The posts along the walls were usually placed in pairs, one on either side of the wall-stones. 3 On the earlier excavations in this series measurements are given in feet and inches. Later we changed over to metric measurements in all fieldwork and dimensions are given for these later sites in metres and centimetres. Though usage is not constant in the paper this should not make for undue difficulty since scales in both systems are given on the plans.</page><page sequence="5">?

As already remarked the only considerable gap in the wall-stones was at the south-west corner, and this was, therefore, the only position which can be suggested as the entrance to the house. A considerable amount of charcoal in the soil, especially in the neighbourhood of the walls indicates that the existence of the house ended by its having been burnt. The clay surface showed signs of this burning in places, especially near the north-west corner in the area marked on the plan and also to a lesser extent near the north-east corner. An approximately circular burnt area near the centre of the house indicated the position of the hearth. The character of the wall-stones and the placing of the posts make it possible to make some suggestions as to the construction of the house. The irregular stones used were not suitable for the building of a formal wall an?i, as already noted, there was nowhere any indication of a wall face. These stones, therefore, must have served merely as a foundation course. They were placed in position, propped on turfs or small stones in approximate straight lines to outline the house and to support the upper portions of the walls. What material was used in the upper portions can only be surmised, but the arrangement of posts close to aiid at both sides of the wall-stones is evidence that these were used not merely to support the roof but also to hold the wall material between the outer and inner rows. It may be accepted that some perishable organic material was used ; clay walls would probably have left a greater deposit around the stones and in any case the double line of posts would not have been necessary. Brushwood, grass or rushes may have been used for the body of the walls and could have been held in position by means of branches, wattles or such, laid between the posts on both sides of the wall. The roof-structure is also a matter of inference. The lack of a medial line of posts does not preclude the possibility of a ridge-pole but it does make it a less important feature, as does also the fact that there is no difference in size between the post-holes at the walls and those towards the middle of the house. Though it cannot be proved, one is inclined to think of a roof which sloped gradually up from the walls at both sides and possibly formed a curved outline in cross-section. Such a roof would not be vulnerable to the wind and could be so constructed as to give sufficient slope to throw off the rain. In this connexion one thinks of the construction of the thatched roofs of north-western Ireland?portions of Co, Mayo and West and North Co. Donegal. In these the couples do not meet at the top but are secured by two collar braces fastened by trenails, thus shorter beams can be used and a stream-lined curve of roof is produced.4 Normally in * Evans, " Donegal Survivals ", Antiquity, 13 (1939), 212.</page><page sequence="7">? VL?ord?sn?Lough Gut Excavations. ??? these houses the couples rest on the side-walls but in one of those described by Evans (House B, Meenacreevagh) posts are shown inside the walls for supporting the couples. It is not, of course, argued that the same details of construction of roof were present in our Site A house as in the modern examples. Couples probably were not used; the irregular alignment- of the post-holes across the house would argue against them. The same curved roof could have been achieved by increasing the heights of the posts towards the middle, laying horizontal timbers between them along the length of the house and placing the rafters on these. A suggested reconstruction on these lines is given (Fig. 2); the roof is slightly* less rounded than in the Donegal cottage which is shown for comparison. Fig. 2.?Suggested cross-section Site A, Knockadoon and cross-section of Donegal cottage (after Evans, Antiquity) for comparison.</page><page sequence="8">304 Proceedings of the Boyal Irish Academy. The arrangement of the internal posts gives a plan in which the floor space is divided into aisles, a middle one and a narrow one at either side. This arrangement may, however, have been incidental to the roof construction and not due to a tripartite division. The side space would in some places have been too narrow to have been of practical uae?for instance in the case of the post-holes eaySt of the centre which are only about 2?' apart. Variants of this type of house are well represented in Northern Europe. Some striking examples are those excavated by Dr. van Giffen at Ezinge,5 It seems likely that in some of these the posts placed in rows parallel to the walls were intended merely as roof-supports. In others they were joined to the walls by wicker partitions and wicker mats were laid along the length of the house. The side divisions in these cases presumably had a definite purpose?probably for cattle, as Dr. van Giffen suggested. Houses excavated in Jutland have been described by Professor Hatt0 and are of two types?a short rectangle or almost a square and a long rectangle. The walls were of clay but again internal posts provide support for the roof. A conjectural cross-section (after H. Zangenberg) has been published by Professor Hatt,7 who, however, thinks that * ' it may underrate the carpentry of Iron Age house builders} \ The immediate interest of the Jutland houses is that the presence of internal posts gives a reconstruction similar to the Site A house. Houses (of the Migration Period) excavated in Rogaland, Norway,8 have stone walls, are rectangular in plan and have internal post-holes which are generally placed either near the inside of the walls or in two rows parallel to them in the manner of the Site A house. One of the houses attached to the stone fort Carraig Aille9 was also a long rectangle and had posts inside but these were placed close to the wall and presumably served to hold the roof down on the walls. Another major difference in construction between the Site A house and those at Carraig Aille was in the method of wall building. In the Carraig Aille houses and in others of Early Christian and Mediaeval date excavated at Lough Gur and Caherguillamore10 the walls had a facing of stone on both sides and a rubble fill between?quite different from the line of large stones which formed the foundation course of the Site A house.11 ?

R?ord?tn?Lough Gur Excavations. 305 The comparative material we have quoted in connexion with the Site A house plan is all of later date. Professor Hatt's houses are Iron Age. Dr. van Giffen's are Iron Age and later, and the Rogaland houses vary in date from the first centuries a.d. to Mediaeval times. Rectangular Neolithic houses are well known on the Continent12 but they usually possess a medial line of posts. The plan presented by the post-holes in some cases is similar to ours but the reconstructions suggest that the outer walls sloped in to receive support from the parallel lines of internal posts.13 Nearer home we have two examples of Neolithic post-hole houses?one at Haldon, Devon14 and one at Ronaldsway, Isle of Man.15 The position of the walls of the Haldon house was indicated by a spread of stones around the lines of post-holes and it is interesting to note that like the Site A house tha door was in the corner. It differed, however, in that the internal post-holes were in the middle only. The Ronaldsway house resembled ours in that the long axis ran up-hill, the hearth was similarly placed and the position of such internal post-holes as it was possible to recognise seemed also to correspond. It differed by reason of the fact that the floor was below the level of the! surrounding surface. The Site A house was larger than those at Haldon or Ronaldsway. Its dimensions (measured inside the walls) were 32' x 20'; the Haldon house was 24' x 12' and that at Ronaldsway 2(K x 14'. As well as these examples of post-hole houses the rectangular house of stone is also represented in Britain in early contexts. The houses at Skara Brae16 and at Rinyo17, built with stone-faced walls, were rectangular with rounded corners, and date to pre-Beaker times. They were not long houses, however, the dimensions varying between 20' x 18' and 14' x 12'. A recently published account of the excavations of a farm site in Southern Norway18 has come to hand after the above pages were written. The houses here were similar to those excavated by Dr. Peteraen in Rogaland, which have been mentioned above, and these also dated to the Migration Period. In his discussion of the cultural affinities, Hagen draws attention to the similarity of these Norwegian houses to those in Sweden, and rubble, in the manner of the houses of historic period at Lough Gur. Most of the Fontbuisse houses are round but a few irregularly rectangular.

Houses showing similar plan but smaller in size, found in Northern Norway are not regarded as providing antecedents. Earlier rectangular houses are cited in Bronze Age and Neolithic contexts in Germany and, eastward, in the Tripolje culture, and the conclusion is presented that the "Nordic rectangular house with two rows of roof supports has old traditions in different European forms of culture". The Knockadoon house must now be added to the examples cited as forerunners of the Nordic house. Since Site A is the best example of an early rectangular house on Knockadoon, the question of this type of house has been discussed at some length and the examples quoted show that the rectangular house is elsewhere known in Neolithic contexts on the Continent and in Great Britain, but the lengthy discussion at this stage does not imply that Site A was the only rectangular house on Knockadoon, and others will be dealt with below. Finds. The finds belong to two groups?those which can be ascribed to a Neolithic date and a few objects which are obviously more recent and some of which may, in fact, be modern. The relationship of these finds to the structure is important from the view-point of the date of the house. Finds came from all levels, the humus, the dark layer, the wall filling and the floor. The later finds, however, all came from above the floor level. Though some were deep in the humus none was in association with the floor. The early material on the other hand was not only found in the upper levels but was also trodden into the floor. This was notably true of the pottery which, in several instances, was found in,such condition as to show that it had been trampled into the clay of the house floor, and, again, several fragments were found in a pocket in the floor in the north-eastern corner of the house. It is also worthy of remark that the majority of the sherds came from the northern part of the house where the hearth was also found, and therefore in the area in which most domestic activity would have taken place. It may therefore be accepted that the Neolithic material is in primary association with the building and that the house is dated by it. Pottery (Fig. 3). The amount of pottery found on Site A?a total of about one hundred sherds?was small in comparison with that from most of the other sites. The majority of the sherds are of hard, comparatively thin, dark-coloured (occasionally red) ware, smooth surfaced or sometimes</page><page sequence="11">? ?

" corky" because of the use of a grass temper, and of fine or slightly gritty paste. The rims and shoulders show this to be typical Windmill Hill type of ware and for convenience of reference it is proposed to refer to this pottery on the Knockadoon sites under the term "Class I". Only one piece (12) bears any ornament19; it has short stab marks on the edge of the fragment. About one-third of the pieces are heavier and much more gritty and to this type of ware belong flat rims (2, 3). This is the type of pottery referred to as "coarse ware"20 and designated "Class II" here; it will be more fully described in connexion with Site C below. Among the coarse sherds are a number which contain large white grits, which Mr. G. P. Mitchell has identified as cleavage fragments of crystalline calcite. These fragments are in some instances as much as 6 mm. in length, and were evidently incorporated in the paste as "temper". The ware in which they occur is light buff on surface, both outside and inside and the white grits are set in a dark grey paste. Flint and chert (Pig. 5). About eighty pieces of flint and chert were found, the former material being much more numerous than the latter, which was about one-sixth of the total. The majority of the pieces were waste fragments? selected examples of worked pieces are figured. There are two leaf-shaped arrow-heads, one (9), well-made but broken above the base, of flint, the other (10) crudely made, tip broken, of chert. Many of the flints are round scrapers or pieces (3) on which a steep curved scraper edge forms part of the perimeter. Several of these (3, 18, 19) are made from flint pebbles as is shown by the portions of the cortex which remain. A very small example (14) also comes from near the surface of a pebble. Smaller and very finely chipped is one (11) made from a translucent flake of flint. Some flakes (1, 2, 4) have the ends worked to a round-nosed scraper form. No. 8 is a well-made short blade, and No. 6 is a flake with edge serrated as from use as a scraper. A few pieces are so small as to merit the description "microlithic" and while some of these are probably accidentally formed others are well shaped and appear to be deliberate products, e.g. a piece of a small blade (17) and some tiny points possibly intended as tips for darts (12, 13). Quartz (Fig 3). A feature of the sites excavated on Knockadoon was the occurrence there of microlithic implements made from quartz crystals. These have l?

Many of these were roughly broken pieces, one was an unaltered crystal of normal five-sided form, and of the remainder the majority were flakes which had no definite shape. We were convinced in the case of some pieces that the quartz had been worked deliberately and this became a certainty when better examples came to light on some of the other sites. A selection of quartz finds from Site A are shown and are, in general, small points, the most likely use of which was to serve as tips for darts as has been suggested in the case of the small flints already noted. One piece (16) is probably waste produced by the removal of long minute flakes from the crystal.and is of interest in showing how adeptly it was possible to do this. Stone. A broken greenstone axe (Fig 4: 1), found under the inner side of the large wall stone in the north wall is of broad oval cross-section? the type most usually represented on the Knockadoon sites.

Three of these were of the same material as the axe, the fourth (20) of an equally hard, dark stone. The chipping of stone axes and the use of the flakes from them as scrapers, as shown by the serrated edges, is a feature noted on Knockadoon sites and on other sites in the Lough Gur area. The most interesting stone object from the site is a tapering piece of slate (Fig. 4: 2) of thin pointed oval cross-section. It is broken at both ends but when complete it evidently came to a point at the narrow end. The fragment is part of a slate spear-head of the type dealt with by Raftery,23 who figured eight examples, the most southerly find-place for the localised examples being Athlone. Since then two specimens have been found : one from Annaholty, Co. Tipperary24 and another dredged from the sea at Derrymihin West Townland, near Cast?etown-Bearhaven, Co. Cork. The Lough Gur fragment is a further instance of the southern distribution, and is the first found other than as a chance find.25 It confirms the Neolithic dating ascribed to the type,26 though, whatever its ultimate derivation?from the Baltic dwelling-place cultures via Neolithic B has been suggested?its context here is Neolithic A. Later objects (Fig. 4). Objects not appropriate to the Neolithic culture were not numerous; they comprised some fragments of iron, a small portion of a bone comb and a piece of a whetstone : The whetstone is a tabular piece of fine-grained sandstone, rectangular in cross-section, with smoothly rounded edges. The piece of bone comb bears typical dot-and-circle ornament. One iron object (4) has a corrugated head on a broken, bent shank; like the other iron objects it was very seriously corroded and while it suggests the spring end of a fibula it cannot with confidence be declared to be such. These three objects were found immediately under the turf?the recorded depths being between 2" and 4". The remaining objects in this group are of iron and, again, are so corroded as to make uncertain their original shape and purpose. These were found deeper in the humus?at depths of about 1', but none was on or in the clay surface. No. 5 is an iron nail; since very little metallic iron is present it is difficult to be certain of the original shape of No. 6, but it appears to be a knife-blade as shown by the triangular cross-section ; 23 ?.J.A., 5 (1942), 121. ^P.P.S., 12 (1946), PL XIV, 3. 25 Another example was found in the excavation of Site C, 1949 (p. 379).</page><page sequence="15">?

No. 3 is a flat piece of iron with an eye at one end and may be a fastening for a leather harness strap. It was found with some other indeterminate pieces of iron just over the pavement in the southern part of the house. No. 96 is a flat piece of iron probably part of the base of a vessel?found just inside the western wall and about 2" over the clay floor. Animal Bones. The bones found consisted of about 1000 fragments of ox bones and two fragments of the teeth of a young horse.27 SITE B. This site (Fig. 6) being nearer to the lake shore, was subject to the effects of soil slip to a much greater extent than Site A. The configuration of the hill accentuated this difference. Above Site A the slope lessened and terminated in high rock out-crop, while Site B had a steeply-sloping area above it. Further, there was no indication of the existence of more than one building on Site A, but, as we shall see, at least two buildings and three successive floor levels were evidenced at Site B. The accumulation of material on the latter site was, therefore, considerable? as much as 3' over original ground level. Because of successive building, Site B was less satisfactory structurally than Site A?the complete plan of any one house could not be recovered. On the other hand the depth of stratification and the much larger amount of material left no doubt as to the early date of the site and, since the same building technique was noted in one wall as that used for the walls of Site A, it provided valuable confirmation of thte dating of Site A. As in the case of the first site our attention was directed to Site B by reason of a series of large stones which appeared above the grass surface. These were mainly arranged in an E-W line about 20' in length with a few stones north of the eastern end of this line. It was hoped that on excavation further stones would be revealed to indicate a complete house-plan. This did not, however, prove to be the case and the stones as finally uncovered (PI. XVI : a) were substantially the same as those seen before excavation. 27 AH the reports on animal bones in this paper are based on the work of Mr. J. Hyland National Museum, who examined the bones at Lough Gur, and on the reports supplied by Mr. A. W. Stelfox, M.R.I.A., and Mr. Hyland.</page><page sequence="17">! I fea s e o ?

Numerous post-holes were found. Since these could not be recognised in the higher levels and only became clear in the clay, it was not possible to assign them to their respective houses. That there were successive buildings, or at least considerable alteration on the site is shown not only by the confused pattern of the post-holes but also by the occurrence of post-holes directly under the wall-stones on the south and by successive layers over portion of the site. Three layers could be distinguished; a burnt area was noted directly on the clay at an average depth of 2' 6"; above this was a black stratum at a depth of about 1' 6" and immediately over this was a layer of stones?the remains of a paving. The wall-stones which drew our attention to the site in the first instance appertained to a later stage in the history of the site. As has already been mentioned they overlay earlier post-holes and the humus under them was greater than that under any of the wall-stones in Site A and must have been largely due to prior accumulation and not merely to the propping of the stones on turf as suggested in the case of the first site. Whatever the shape and method of construction of the earlier house or houses on the site, the wall on the south was clearly of the same type as the walls of Site A. When we omit those which were directly under the stones, we find we are left with three pairs of post-holes which are arranged on either side of the wall-stones in a manner strikingly similar to those on Site A. There was little to indicate the remaining outline of the Site B house to which the stones and post-holes on the southern side belonged, but other stones and post-holes give indications of an eastern side forming an approximate right-angle writh that along the south. A central hearth which occurred at a high level probably belongs to this building. A trench, depth varying between 5" and 7" in the clay, which terminated in a large rectangular post-hole about 16" deep, probably was a wall groove for a wooden wall but whether of the same house as that to which the stones belonged cannot be decided. Rock outcrop appeared here and there on the site and may have influenced the plan of the houses, possibly being utilized instead of wall-stones in places. This may have caused the outline to be irregular but there is in any case evidence that one building on the site was rectilinear and probably approximately rectangular. Finds. Pottery (Figs. 7, 8, 9). The amount of pottery found on this site was very large in comparison with the amount from Site A. The total number of sherds is over six hundred and fifty, of which more than two-thirds came from the north-east quadrant and hence from the area where there was most over lapping of successive layers.</page><page sequence="19">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 315 With the exception of two sherds, a piece of Food Vessel (Fig. 9 : 2) and a Beaker sherd (14) all the pottery can be described as formally Neolithic. No sherds of Class II ("coarse ware") mentioned as occurring on Site A, were included. Shouldered vessels were evidently usual?as is shown by the number of shoulder fragments from different vessels, varying in colour, thickness and texture. Normally the technique of building the shoulders of these pots is not apparent?they usually appear to have been simply pinched out. Some of the sherds from this site are, however, more informative. Shoulder fragments in some cases (e.g. Fig. 8) show clearly that the upper and lower portions of the pot were made separately and that the upper part was set into the lower so that the upper edge of the latter formed the shoulder. This is shown in the restored drawing (Fig. 8) where not only can the joining be detected in the section but where also the shaling off of part of the edge of the lower portion reveals the outer surface of the upper part. It is not argued that all the shoulders were made in this manner and certainly it cannot be detected on most, but it does provide a technical reason for the existence of the shoulder independent of the usual suggestion of its being a skeuomorphic feature derived from a leather prototype. One piece (Fig. 7: 23) has a slight ridge, not a shoulder, which was evidently formed by the potter's fingers being run around the body of the pot. One fragment (22) has the shoulder expanded to form a lug. Another (Fig. 9 : 9) which is ornamented with short impressions along the angle of the shoulder has two similarly ornamented raised ridges which run from the shoulder down the body of the pot. It is likely from the appearance of one of these that the ridges were applied to the surface and not pinched out on it. The rims represented among the Site B material fall into two groups. Numerically more numerous are rims of Class I type (Fig. 7), already referred to in dealing with Site A. These are simply rounded or have slightly everted expansions, rounded or somewhat pointed in section. The second group (Fig. 9) which we shall call Class la is more striking in that the rims bear ornament and are larger and more elaborate in form. In general the sections are club- or T-shaped, the top horizontal or slightly curved and bearing an ornament of radial lines or of concentric lines with short strokes between them. The lines were all made with some object such as a pointed stick ; none are comb or cord impressions, though cord ornament or simulated cord ornament does occur in similar patterns on pottery elsewhere. The normal size of these club- and T-rims is about 15 to 25 mm. across. There are, however, two pieces (5, 10) which are strikingly large. It is not certain that both come from the same pot because portions are broken off the edges of each, but they either belong to the same or to similar pots. They were found about 3?' apart at the bottom of the dark layer. The great size of the rims (about 70 mm. in width where PR?C. R.I.A., VOL. 56, SECT. C.

R?ord?in?Lough our Excavations. 317 approximately complete) and the thickness of the body of the vessel suggest a pot of very large size. These rim fragments are, however, quite out of the ordinary and nothing so exaggerated has been found on any of the other Knockadoon sites. In a few instances it was possible to find rim and shoulder pieces that fitted (4) or were so similar in paste and texture as to make it certain Fig. 8.?Site B: Reconstructed drawing .of Class la pot (?). that they came from the same pot (Fig. 8). These indicated that the Class la pots were of the same shouldered forms as were those with simpler "Windmill Hill" type rims. Both classes of pottery varied in surface and texture, some being hard and smooth, some pitted and "corky" in appearance because of a generous use of grass temper in manufacture. The latter type of ware was predominant in Class la pots. In some examples (Fig. 9: 3) it can be seen that to make the club rim the clay was bent over and folded under; in cases where it did not completely join, the method of manufacture is evident. In the matter of stratification both classes of pottery were clearly contemporary, but Class la predominated at the earliest level. A Class I</page><page sequence="22">Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy uz?z?2&gt; 9 "T It f 14 12 ~~ 13 Fig. 9.?Site B : Pottery?Class la, Beaker and Food Vessel (1).</page><page sequence="23">? Riordain?Lough Gur Excavations. 319 rim occurred on the burnt surface with the pot shown in the restored drawing (Fig. 8). The piece of Food Vessel (Fig. 9: 2), dark in colour, sandy in texture with ornament of impressed triangles and hyphenated lines, was found immediately on the surface of the dark layer. It may indicate the latest habitation phase or it may have been trampled into the surface after the site was abandoned. The piece is made up of fragments that have been joined together. On some of these the surface is very altered, probably by reason of exposure, and on these the ornament has disappeared and the surface has become rough and gritty, while on others the ornament remains clearly marked. This would perhaps give some support to the suggestion that the food-vessel piece was trampled into the surface after the site was abandoned, some of the fragments being protected by being buried, others deteriorating by exposure. The Beaker fragment (14) was found in the brown soil higher than the dark layer but outside its limit (in the north-east quadrant), and was clearly later than the main bulk of the material from the site. Stone (Fig. 10). One stone axe (1), the butt-end of two others (2, 3), and eight pieces of axes were found. The axe, which is almost complete except that the edges are chipped, is of a dark close-grained stone. All the other specimens are of greenstone?varying somewhat in shade and texture. Some of the fragments are large, irregularly-shaped pieces, others are the usual chips evidently removed for use as scrapers. Four perforated flat stone beads were found, three of which were very small. The larger bead (13), about 30 mm. in diameter, is of a grey-blue fine-grained soft rock of slaty nature. The diameters of the small beads are much less?between 7 and 11 mm. One (14) is of the same material as the large one; another (16), which is broken, is a brown soft rock with slaty cleavage (perhaps altered volcanic ash). Th? other bead (15), slightly dome-shaped in section, i? a pale green fine-grained soft rock with inclusions of grey metallic mineral (perhaps serpentine with iron oxide). While the materials for the other beads could have been obtained locally (in the Co. Limerick area), that of No. 15 must have come from further afield.28 Two objects of sandstone found immediately under the turf are a broken stone disc (7) and a whetstone (Find No. 66, not illustrated). The disc is of the type found in so many different contexts; these discs are usually not perforated, but in this case a hole was commenced by pecking at both sides of the stone, thus causing the stone to break. The 28 This opinion and the details of the materials of the stone beads were kindly con tributed by Mr. G. F. Mitchell.</page><page sequence="24">320 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. whetstone is rectangular in cross-section. The high level at which they were found indicates that these objects are not likely to have had any connexion with the habitation of the site. Flint and chert (Fig. 10). The amount of flint and chert from Site B was not large?^at total of twenty-two pieces, of which about one-third was chert and much of the Fig. 10.?Site B : Stone and flint objects (i). remainder was of poor-quality flint. Many of the pieces were irregularly shaped fragments or waste from working and only a few merit comment. No. 10 is portion of a flint leaf-shaped arrow-head; No. 9 (chert) is an unusual form, a tanged point made from a flake, finely pressure-flaked over the whole of the curved surface and along the edges on the flat face. No. 11 is a thumb scraper steeply worked on part of the perimeter, and portion of a chert blade (12) is similarly worked on the edges.</page><page sequence="25">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 321 Quartz. Nine chips of quartz as well as over a dozen unwork?d pi?ces (crystals or fragments) were found. Two are illustrated (Fig. 3)?one (17) is a triangular point, the other (18) a blade struck from the outside of a crystal, portions of the faces of which remain and form surf aces of the blade. Animal Banes. The bones were very fragmentary. They were mainly bones of ox with a few fragments of sheep (or goat), pig, red deer, dog (or wolf), and bird. The remains of dog or wolf comprise two vertebrae and some broken fragments, representing a large dog or a small wolf, but there is not sufficient to allow one to decide? to which animal the remains belonged. The bird bones are broken, but may be recognised with fair accuracy as the right and left humuri of a Barnacle goose and the hum?rus of a Mallard. SITE C. Site C lay east of Site A and occupied a considerable portion of the hill-side which sloped from north to south, the lake shore being about 114 yards to the south. The area was attractively placed for habitation not only because of its southern aspect but also because it was to some extent sheltered from the east by the rocky ridge on which Site D was situated. Excavation of this site was carried out because it was noticed that stones forming an approximate right angle appeared over the surface and it was thought that these indicated one corner of a rectangular house?possibly of the same type as that already uncovered on Site A. As the excavation proceeded, however, it was found that these stones were part of a wall (shown PI. XVII and in dotted outline PI. XVIII) which extended much further than originally anticipated and which represented a late phase of activity on the site. The excavation which was begun at the south-western portion of the site was extended to follow the whole of this wall and, subsequently, to uncover a further portion of the occupied area to the north. This resulted in a larger area being investigated here than on any other of the Knockadoon sites?about 6,500 square feet being uncovered down to undisturbed ground level. Because of the large area excavated, the considerable amount of pottery and other finds and the deep deposit over portion of the site?particularly to the north (PI. XX : b)?Site C is the most important of the Knockadoon sites from the viewpoint of general conclusions as to pottery sequence and stratification.</page><page sequence="26">322 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Depth of stratification varied considerably but was in general deeper to the north (about 3?0 and especially in the north-eastern portion of the site. At the conclusion of the excavation season in 1940 we realised that the occupation extended still further up the hillslope to the north and that further investigations were desirable in view of the depth of deposit of which we had evidence here,29 In general two phases may be distinguished in the occupation of Site C. The earlier was represented by post-holes, pits and trenches in the under lying surface (PL XXIII), which was of clay overlying the limestone or, in places, of more sandy soil. The latter phase was represented by the meandering wall, portion of which drew our attention to the site in the first instance, and by paving or cobbled floors which covered portions of the site (PL XVII). It must, however, be emphasised that there is no evidence of any interval in the continuity of occupation and the suggestion of two phases means merely the recognition of two structural levels. The upper was built on varying depths of habitation refuse and accumulations of debris derived probably from intervening stages of habitation. Although the deposits varied in intensity of dark colouring?due to the variation of humus and charcoal content?there was no sterile layer, and finds, especially pottery, were forthcoming at all levels. The upper layers did not produce satisfactory post-holes. These could only be recognised with confidence on the old ground level, but the loose nature of the upper material made it possible that some of the post-holes were dug from a higher level, though these could not be distinguished from those originally dug in the clay surface. The lack of post-hole evidence in the higher layers makes it impossible to state what was the latest type of building on the site, and all that can be done is to describe briefly the remains as found. Over most of the area a gravel surface became apparent under the turf (PL XX: a). This was, it may be accepted, largely a natural phenomenon due to hill-wash and consolidation of the soil. A similar gravel layer is to be noted on most sites where there is a stony soil and usually represents the line of demarcation at the base of the turf. The gravel layer on Site C was notably well-marked and in places the lime stone fragments which it contained were bleached white as from exposure. While the formation of this layer was, therefore, due to natural causes it would appear to mark the level of the abandonment of the site. At this stage the soil consolidated and the gravel became compacted, the lighter material being washed from it. Over portions of the site there appeared instead of the gravel layer a layer of larger stones which had almost the appearance of a deliberately * This further work was carried out in 1949 and is reported on in subsequent pages (Site C, 1949). The description of the 1940 excavation, already written before the northern extension of the site was uncovered, has been allowed to stand so that the two portions are treated as separate units in this paper.</page><page sequence="27">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 323 laid cobbling. This was in evidence mainly in the north-west portion of the site where it covered approximately a quadrant of a circle of radius 25'. This again had probably the same origin as the gravel layer but formed on those portions of the site where the material was more stony because of the nature of the buildings which had occupied the site. The stress which has been laid on these layers of gravel or stone is due to the fact that together they provided an important feature for dating over almost the entire site. It was possible to segregate the objects found into two groups?first, those which came from below the layer, and secondly, those which came from it or from above it. The latter group was a miscellaneous collection of objects, some early, derived from the habitation of the site, others of various dates ranging from an advanced period in the Bronze Age to Early Christian or later times. But of the material under the gravel (or "cobbled") layer nothing can be placed later than the Beaker period. It is clear, therefore, that while late material got lost upon and trampled into the gravel layer, to be found there with pottery and other objects similar to that below it, the layer sealed the material below so that this remained chronologically uncontaminated. In conjunction with the wall already mentioned portions of paving occurred. These remained mainly in two places?between the two parallel east-west lengths of wall and south of the southern of these. This latter pavement extended through a gap in the north-south length of wall to the west of it. The character of the wall (PL XVI : b) was not uniform. In places it was no more than a loose collection of stones piled together without any good building. A more regular facing of stones appeared on the outer line of the wall north and east of the south-west angle. Larger stones occurred at the east, probably because they were more easily available here on the limestone outcrop which bordered the site, but the wall was somewhat more indefinite here and the materials more scattered than elsewhere. The general outline of the space enclosed by the wall is a series of three rectangular areas, that on the east being most irregular. Association of paving with the wall suggests that the latter formed in part at least the wall of a house or of more than one house, but it may also have served to enclose accompanying yards. The date of this building remains uncertain, because at this level occurred the miscellaneous group of finds, which were in part incorporated in the material of the wall. The loose stony material made it impossible to differentiate at this level between finds in real association and those which were intrusive. Since, however, the wall was built directly on the underlying habitation refuse it seems likely that no great time span separated it from the earlier material and a date in the developed Bronze Age would therefore seem likely. In this case such</page><page sequence="28">324 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. things as iron nails, other iron fragments,, a bronze fibula, late ninth century silver coins and other objects must be regarded as of accidental occurrence even when found among the collapsed stones of the wall. The limited amount and the wide chronological range of the late material on the site strengthens the suggestion that it was not in primary association with the wall. Furthermore, it has already been suggested that the gravel layer indicated the abandonment of the site. Now this layer, in places flowed on to the remains of the wall and it was found on the same level as the paving between the walls but not under it. If the late objects were contemporary with the wall it is likely that some of , these would have been found under the gravel layer, but this did not happen here as it did not on other parts of the site. As already indicated, the removal of the upper layers revealed on the old ground surface a series of pits, trenches, post-holes and hearths. As may be seen from the plan (PI. XVIII) these occur in practically all parts of the site. They could be recognised only when the old ground surface had been reached, and the depths given for post-holes, pits and trenches mean, therefore, the depths to which they have been dug under this surface. The pits varied considerably in size and their depths varied between 10" and 24". Those of smaller diameter were to be distinguished from the larger post-holes in that the sides sloped inwards while the sides of the post-holes tended to be vertical. The largest and usually the deepest pits accompanied the concentrations of post-holes marked as houses on the plan, and while pottery and other objects occurred in the pits in general, the richest assortment of pottery and other objects was found in the large pits. As well as the scattered pits and post-holes, short lengths of trenches, usually about 8" deep, were found. Some of these contained (or connected) post-holes and were, presumably, short wall grooves. Over the main portion of the site no sensible plan became evident in the placing of these trenches, post-holes and pits. Towards the centre of the site and in the north-west corner of it two groups containing numerous post-holes have been marked " House I" and "House II" respectively. In both cases it will be noticed that tljere is a somewhat confusing superfluity of post-holes in relation to any attempt to bring them into a logical plan. It is evident, therefore, that repair or re-building occurred on these sites. However, the general position of the post-holes enables us to suggest with confidence a circular house, the outline of which is indicated by dotted lines on the plan. We are not left to rely solely on the post-holes for this plan. In both houses' curved trenches give indication of the position of the house-walls. In House I the surface stepped down from the northern side of the house to a trench about 14' in length which takes the place of post-holes along this portion of the perimeter. At the eastern side of House II a narrower</page><page sequence="29">? R?qrd?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 325 trejach about 17' long curved to the outline of the house and contained ? post-holes within it. The circular outline of House I is further defined by stones which form an arc on the south of the house and which served presumably as a footing for Bthe wall. Approximately at the centre of House I (PI. XIX: a) the position of the hearth was indicated by a circular burnt area slightly over two feet in diameter. On the south-eastern side of the hearth and in part within it was a group of seven small post-holes (average diameter 4", depth 6f), which must have been associated with some domestic activity?possibly the posts served to support spits or pot-hangers over the fire. Arouncl the hearth a number of larger posts form an approximate circle about 8' in diameter and evidently indicated the inner support of the house. The remaining post-holes fall mainly into two concentric circles and if, as we suppose, these mark the supports on the outside and inside of the wall the inner diameter of the house was about 17y. Inside the wall on the east was a pit of kidney-shaped outline and about 24" deep. This presumably served as a household rubbish-pit in the manner of the pit which is still found under the "chimney seat" beside the fireplace in some farm-houses in the same area. The position of the door is a matter for conjecture, but a wider spacing of the post-holes on the west and south-west may indicate that it was somewhere on this side of the house. In,House II (PI. XIX: b) the hearth, which was sunk about 6" in the floor, was placed north-west of the centre of the house. The two concentric rows of posts for the wall are fairly well marked, but the numerous posts in the interior do not give a convincing inner circle. A horsesh?e-shaped arrangement of posts around the hearth may be suggested as an inner support, but, like the hearth, it is considerably asymmetrical in relation to the general plan of the house. Instead of one large pit within the house there were several small ones?presumably successively used. The entrance appeared to be at the south, but between the terminal post-holes was a large pit (depth 12"). This presumably did not belong to this house and was, in any case, cut into by a slightly deeper pit (depth 14") north of it. House II was oval in outline, the diameters being about 17' and 21'. In summary it may be said that these two groups of post-holes give evidence of round houses, the walls of which -r?ere supported by outer and inner rings of posts, the space between, on an average 3' in width, probably filled with rushes, brushwood and such material as was suggested in the case of Site A. The roof, partly carried on the walls, was given further support towards the centre by posts around the hearth. In places the walls were embedded in shallow trenches and a stone footing was provided for portion of the wall of House I. North-east of House I and about 20' from it was a hearth formed by a stone setting (about 18" diameter) with near it a second setting</page><page sequence="30">326 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. of stones about the same size. This latter setting had not been used as a hearth but evidently served as a support for cooking pots?the large fragments of one being found lying on it (PL XXI : 6). It is not certain if this hearth was within a house or in the open; post-holes in the vicinity were too haphazard in arrangement to provide any house-plan. Finds. The quantity of material found on this site was very large?over eleven thousand sherds of pottery together with numerous other objects. It is obvious therefore that it is not practicable to attempt the same close description of the finds as could be done if the amount were much smaller. It has already been indicated that the gravel layer which appeared under the turf is to be regarded as an important stratigraphical feature. In and above this layer early and late material appeared side by side ; under it however no late object was found. Hence the material sealed by the gravel layer will indicate the main period of occupation of the site and must be considered separately. The rich selection of pottery from the site is important, since it gives a sequence indicating the changes in pottery styles which took place during the occupation of the site. In our discussion of the pottery the different classes will be dealt with under the designations (Class I, Class la and Class II) already mentioned above in connexion with Sites A and B. Pottery. The amount of pottery from this site was larger than that from any other single site on Knockadoon, there being a total of over eleven thousand sherds. The large yield of pottery enables us to present a classification on a surer basis ;; it also obviates the necessity for re-defining this classification in dealing with the pottery from other sites. As with the types of pottery so also the sequence of typtes is based on the evidence as a whole. The facts presented here are in part based on observations made during the excavation but are largely based on subsequent study of the pottery. For this purpose a large floor space was marked out in squares following the plan of the excavated area. On the squares the pottery was laid out in order of depth so that the sequence in each square could be studied. The description of the pottery is here dealt with first and this is followed by a discussion of the sequence. The main bulk of the pottery falls into three groups?Class I, Class la, and Class II. Reference has already been made to these in dealing with the pottery from Sites A and B, but the much greater bulk of material from Site C allows us to study the characteristics more fully. Class I (Figs. 11, 12). The term Class I is applied here to pottery of the type which, with the changing fashion in archaeological</page><page sequence="31">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 327 nomenclature has been successively known as "Windmill Hill", "Neolithic A" and "Western Neolithic". For convenience it has been decided to use a numerical designation for this ware from the Knockadoon sites. This has the further advantage that it avoids an absolute identification of the Lough Gur pottery (which exhibits local developments and peculiarities) with any one of the British or Continental groups. Pottery of Class I has already been described in dealing With Sites A and B and in the published report of the excavation of another site on Knockadoon.30 The series discussed was much smaller than that from Site C but many of the characteristics already observed tend to recur in the larger selection of material. Colour varies considerably, the most usual being a dark brown, chocolate colour or almost black. Other sherds are red, buff, light brown or occasionally grey. Again the colour of one pot may vary over different parts of its surface, or the inner and outer surfaces may differ?some sherds being almost black on the inside, but light buff or red on the outside. The sherds are generally hard and well-baked, the surface being smooth and burnished. Grit was freely used?mixed with the paste to provide a temper in the firing. These grits are generally of calcite more finely ground however than that remarked on in the Class II sherds from House A. Crushed quartzite was also used in many cases. Where grits had dropped out the surface of the pottery is rough and pitted. This sometimes was to be noted on the inside surfaces while the outside, evidently better prepared during manufacture, remained smooth. A "corky" surface appearance which many sherds showed, was evidently due to the use of a different type of temper?the admixture of grafio which burned out during the firing, thus leaving spaces which produced the cork-like appearance. A small proportion of the sherds were of a fine paste and smooth surface, showing neither the admixture of grits nor the use of grass as a temper. In particular these gritless, hard and smooth sherds belonged to small round cups baked red in colour on the surface, the body of the material being either reddish or grey (Fig, 15). While Class I pottery is, of course, round-bottomed, there is considerable variation in detail as well as in size. It is not possible to decide what percentage of the pots were carinated but, except for the small round cups mentioned, any vessels which could be reconstructed or of which reconstructed drawings were made, have shoulders (Fig. 12). Rim shapes vary considerably as is shown on the illustration (Fig. 11), the simplest being upright rounded rims which possibly belong to unshouldered vessels (2-9). A flattened rim (1) is shown but this is unusual. Pots with out-turned profiles, in many cases retain this simple 30 "Site J, Knockadoon", J.R.S.A.I., 77 (1947), 39.</page><page sequence="32">328 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. form of rim (12-22) as do also others with'interned outline (2*-25)?

The remaining examples (34r-46) are more elaborate, the clay having been bent at a distinct angle and the upper surface flattened to give rims of club- and T-forms. With the development of the T shape the major projection may be on the inside of the rim (45 and 46). The upper Fig. 13.?Site C: Class la?Reconstructed pot and rims (?). surface of the rim may slope outwards or inwards. One example shows an unusual club form (40) in which the upper surface has a depression and it is clear that this rim was made by folding over the clay and pressing it in against the side of the vessel. These club- and T-rims though included here with Class I are obviously related to the more developed and decorated forms which have been classed as la. While perforations occur between rim and shoulder on pottery of this class the feature is rare on this site (only two examples?not illustrated), but is better represented on Site D dealt with below.</page><page sequence="35">?

The variation in shoulder forms (Fig. 11: 47-55) appears to be due not only to the shape of the pot but very largely to the method of manufacture. Some are simply a change of curvature in the outline of of the vessel. Others are pinched out on the surface while some are applied strips of clay. Others result from the method of manufacture referred to above in dealing with the pot from site B in which the upper is set into the lower portion of the pot, the overlap forming the shoulder. Class la (Figs. 13, 14). This type of pottery was well represented on Site B and its characteristics have already been described. It comprises pots with ornamented club- and T-rim forms. Though some of these are not more developed than examples in Class I, the group as a whole shows a tendency towards larger and more elaborate rims. These large rims were not merely an ornamental feature carrying decoration but served also to strengthen the vessels which in general were of comparatively large size and in many of which the ware was surprisingly thin. The rims are in general heavy but one unusually light example is illustrated (5). Fig. 15.??ite C: Small cups (\). In so far as can definitely be established all pottery of this class is carinated. The shoulders were well-developed and in some cases bore lugs in the form of small bosses (Fig. 13: 1). A vertical ridge which tapered downwards from the shoulder occurred on two sherds (Fig. 14: 15) and may be a lug or merely an ornamental feature. There is one example of a shoulder in the form of a raised band bearing vertical!</page><page sequence="37">? R?ordain?Lough Gur Excavations. 3?a strokes (19) and another with an ornament under the shoulder of horizontal lines with short oblique strokes between them (16). Another shoulder sherd (18) is also ornamented with horizontal lines, in this case having vertical strokes between them. This ornament is similar to that on some of the rims and shows that these sherds belong to the same class of pottery. As in site B, the ornament, which is mainly confined to the upper surface of the rim, consists of lines concentric with its edges having short diagonal lines between them, or of parallel lines radially or diagonally across the rim. One example has a pattern of short diagonal lines with impressed dots (10) while another has a lightly-incised criss cross design over concentric lines (5). Only one piece (12) has cord or simulated cord ornament. The cord pattern is put on in two concentric lines near the inner edge and across the radial incisions. Another rim (7) bears a series of short stabs which are not true cord ornament but may be intended as an imitation of it. Class II (Figs. 16-19 and PI. XXI : a). Pottery of Class II is quite different from Classes I and la in texture and other characteristics and in the shape of the vessels represented. There is sufficient evidence to show thai, the usual form was a comparatively high, flat-based pot, the sides of which might be almost straight or showing varying degrees of curvature. Not many vessels could be reconstructed and sherds of pots of this shape do not lend themselves to geometric methods of completing the profile as do fragments of round-bottomed vessels. In general however, the pots appear to be comparatively large; reconstructed examples (Fig. 16 and PI. XXI : a) have depths of 26 cm. and 29 cm. Reconstruction was possible where portions of flat base were available and although the total number of base fragments found was small the great majority of the Class II sherds seem to belong to flat-based vessels. The base fragments which are available show in some cases the side forming a simple angle with the base but two examples come from a splay-footed vessel. Some few fragments are, however, consistent with round-bottomed pots. Fig. 18: 17 appears to be part of a small round cup such as we have already seen in Class I but here the ware is coarse and heavy. Nos. 16 and 18 are also curved in a manner which suggests round bottoms?though of larger vessels ; this may also be true of Fig. 19 : 20 and 22. Texture, colour and thickness of the ware varied considerably. Though the texture is usually coarse and is notably so in comparison with pottery of the round bottomed (class (I and la) the degree of coarseness varies with the amount and type of grit used. The most usual type of ware is very coarse and exceedingly gritty?dark grtey verging to black in colour. The thickness of the sherds can be as much</page><page sequence="38">CO CO PL I Co *?* "* I ?fit ^_ ^^^B -- " ?" -?^-"?^r^J^",!

R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 335 as 16 mm. A ware of similar texture/ has an outer surface of a less gritty buff paste. Other thick grey sherds have a finer paste with less grits but are nevertheless open and coarse in texture in comparison with Class I and la. Many examples occur of black and red ware with numerous white grits as also of a finer red ware with smooth surface. The grits which form a striking feature in this class of pottery are either of dark stone or white calcite (PI. XXI : a). Those of dark stone are sometimes very large and badly bonded into the clay.31 They occur in hard, brittle wares while the calcite grits occur generally in wares which when excavated are softer and more porous in texture though they harden considerably on drying. The main variations in colour on this pottery have already been mentioned but these colours may vary on the one pot due to irregularity of firing. Examples occur of single large sherds varying in colour from brick-red to black or from buff to reddish brown or black. The colour tends to be different on inner and outer surfaces of many fragments?of common occurrence are sherds with light buff on the outside and black inside. The surfaces of many sherds are gritty and sandy with protruding grits. Others are smoothed carefully on the outside. Well-finished surfaces on coarse ware are exceptional, however, and the really good hard surface is achieved only on wares which are made from finer paste similar to that used in Class I. These exceptionally good wares (of which only a small number of fragments exist) are included with Class II because of their thickness, rim-shape and other features but they appear to owe something of the technique of manufacture to a Class I tradition. Good surfaces though not so hard and smooth have been mentioned as occurring on otherwise gritty wares. Their most frequent appearance is on sherds of dark gritty paste having a buff exterior. The general good finish and the absence of grits on their outer face shows that the surface of some of the pots was given special treatment. This may have been achieved by rubbing the surface of the vessel with the hands or with a finer paste.32 The rim shapes of Class II, though varied, are in the main of simple form. The majority of examples found have a plain flat rim or a slightly rounded one (Figs. 17, 18). Next in frequency are rims with an internal bevel which may vary from a scarcely preceptible inward inclination to a more definite slope (Fig 19 : 1-9). No. 10 though possibly classifiable 31 Some specimens of the dark grits have been examined by Mr. Mitchell who finds that they are mainly of volcanic ash (one may be a piece of lava). This material could easily be obtained from various rock outcrops in the Lough Gur neighbourhood. 32 By this method is produced what Childe refers to as a " mechanical slip ", noted by him as occurring on the pottery from Rinyo, P.S.A.S., 73 (1938-'39), 23.</page><page sequence="40">336 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy.

Another variation, of which several examples are illustrated, (20, 22) combines an outward projection with an internal bevel and is reminiscent?though in a much less elaborate form?of the T-rim which occurs on Class la. Flat, outward-projecting rims are found (23, 24, 25) which may also be related to forms common on Class la wares. Some sherds show rims whose flat tops have been slightly hollowed or in a few cases expanded by being pressed downwards by the potter's fingers (11-16). No. 27 shows an unusual profile because of the combination of heavy finger corrugations with an inward-projecting rounded rim. Two sherds (21, 26) are very peculiar in form having rims which, though flat in section have serrated upper edges produced by cutting into the wet clay with cord or some sharp implement. Perforations a short distance below the rim occur on pottery of this type and five examples are illustrated (Fig. 19: 4, 12, 14, 22 and Fig. 17 : 2). These perforations vary in size and are both tapering and cylindrical in section. On the reconstructed rim (Fig. 17: 2) perforations occur at fairly regular intervals all round the circumference. It is possible in some of the sherds to recognise the method by which the pots were constructed. Horizontal joins show that the ring-method was used, the vessel being built up of a series of rings of clay the top edge of each being rounded. The next ring was pressed down on this and so had a groove at its lower edge and irregularities of the whole surface were subsequently smoothed out. When a break occurred at these joins false rims resulted. Where firing was well done the joins cannot be detected so that this method of manufacture is not always apparent.33 Ornament which occurs on a considerable number of the pots is mainly of two types?incised and cord. Some of the incised lines are little more than haphazard scorings but others have patterns of intersecting lines diagonal or very rarely vertical immediately below the rim. On one example (Fig. 19:19) there are incisions not only on the outside but also on the surface of the internally bevelled rim. Very closely spaced parallel lines are found on two fragments, on one of which (Fig. 17: 9) they are vertical and on the other (Fig. 18: 6) horizontal. While the lines are usually light, narrow incisions, some are hea^vy grooves which are generally parallel to and just below the edge of the rim (Fig. 19 : 5). The cord ornament, which is not frequent, occurs in horizontal lines (Fig. 17 :4) often accompanied by grooves (Fig. 18 : 9, 12, 15). It also appears as a U-shaped pattern of impressed cord (Fig. 18: 11 and Fig. 17: 3). 33 The ring-method of manufacture is well illustrated in connection with a pot from Rinyo, Orkney, P.S.A.S., 73 (1938-'39), 24.

R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 339 ni? 2? 24 25 26 Fig. 19?Site C: Class II pottery (i).</page><page sequence="44">340 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Other features which might be regarded as ornamental are finger corrugations and raised cordons. The finger corrugations appear on the inside and outside of some of the pots and were produced by running the fingers horizontally on the wet clay (Fig. 17: 1, Fig. 18 : 10, Fig. 19: 27). The cordons are sometimes made by pinching up and folding over the clay (Fig. 17: 7 and 8) ; in other cases they are applied strips as is shown on examples where they have become partly detached from the surface (Fig. 18: 23 and 24). Pig. 20.?Site C: Pottery?Beaker, Food Vessel and various ($). Beaker (Fig. 20: 1-18). The amount of Beaker from Site Q 1940 is small and most of the sherds that can be recognised as belonging to this class are illustrated. Some of the fragments have typical fine, red, Beaker paste and typical Beaker ornament of fine, parallel hyphenated lines. This ornament occurs on both inside and outside of one rim</page><page sequence="45">? R?ordain?Lough Gur Excavations. 341 fragment (1). Other pieces have ornament of continuous parallel lines on Beaker-texture pottery or on somewhat coarser wares. A few fragments of base are included with the Beaker because of their texture; these are sharply splayed at the foot. Food Vessel and Various (Fig. 20). Under this heading are included a number of decorated sherds, the combination of texture and decoration on some of which proclaim them to be Food Vessel; in other case the class of pottery to which they belong must remain undefined. These sherds (all illustrated on Fig. 20) show some rims (19, 20) and portion of a shoulder (21) which may be? accepted as Food Vessel in type. No. 22, which bears chevron ornament on the curved surface of a slightly raised ridge, is of a heavy ware which suggests its inclusion with Food Vessel. Interaction of Beaker and Food Vessel is exemplified by Nos. 23, 24, 25. On the last two, typical Beaker hyphenated-line ornament occurs (on outer surface and on flat rim) on a light ware while in a bolder form it appears on 23 which is heavier ware. None of these has a Beaker rim; No. 23 is in place with Food Vessel and the other two (so non Beaker in profile) are also best regarded as of the same type of pottery.34 Another sherd (26) has similar rim form but different ornament. The Food Vessel sherds were found in and under the gravel layer. A small group (28-30) has a maggot pattern in horizontal lengths. In these the paste and texture are similar to Class II wares and they evidently are another expression of the influences which give cord ornament on some Class II sherds. One sherd (31) has, immediately below the rim, portion of a curved lug ornamented with oval impressions ; there is no indication of the type of pot to which it belonged. A peculiar incised "herring-bone" pattern occurs on one side of a fragment of fine red ware which has parallel lines on the other (32). The Pottery Sequence on Site C, 1940. As has already been emphasised, the depth of deposit, which was considerable, especially to the north of the site, resulted from continuous occupation. There were no intermediate sterile layers, and the only objects that are not in accord with the main bulk of finds came from near the surface. They are comparatively few in number and have a wide chronological range, the earliest being Late Bronze Age; they do not suggest any formal occupation of the site at the periods to which they belong. The advantage of continuous occupation is that it reveals a picture of changing fashion in equipment?reflected most advantageously by the pottery. The disadvantage is that continuous occupation means continuous activity, re-building and disturbance of the deposit. Earlier 34 Interaction between Beaker and Food Vessel has already been noted at a neigh bouring site?Rathjordan, J.?.H.A.S., 53 (1948), 28,</page><page sequence="46">342 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. material is liable to be mixed with later because of the digging of pits, trenches and post-holes. However, even when definite strata are lacking, the general sequence may be confidently established when the bulk of the material is sufficiently large. In the case of Site C the amount of pottery was considerable and1 the results of its study were definite because the same phenomena of change could be observed in the finds from many of the squares into which the excavated area had been divided. As already explained the pottery was studied in relation to depth in the respective squares in which found.35 The sequence as revealed here was paralleled on other sites while still others with shorter periods of occupation tend to complete the picture and to confirm it in detail. The main classes of pottery?I, la, and II?were found on most parts of the site but Classes I and la were rare or absent in the squares on the southern edge, to which, evidently, occupation extended only at a later date when Class I and la had ceased to be normally current. Stated simply the sequence revealed on Site C showed that Classes^ I and la which were in favour at the beginning of the occupation were gradually supplanted by Class II. At neither end of the sequence was the preference exclusive, Class II being found even at old ground level and Class I at the surface, though in both cases in comparatively small quantities. Two facts characterise the Class I wares from the site?its diminishing popularity and, even more notably, the disappearance of the more elaborate features which mark the la variant. It is clear that both I and la were in use when the site was first inhabited but la had a short life there and the heavy ornamented rims which characterise it are found almost exclusively on or near old ground level. The Class I pottery which is found at the highest level is not only small in amount but is simple in type. Class II pottery was found at the lowest level. We have for instance already noted Class II pottery on a stone setting near a hearth on old ground level (PI. XXI : b) and it occurred sporadically all over the site. Of the Class II from the lowest level, a considerable proportion was found in rubbish pits. Since it is probable that these pits were cleared out at intervals it is likely that not all the Class II found at old ground level belonged to the earliest occupation of the site. It may, however, be accepted that Class II was in use at the beginning of occupation but that the amount was small. The proportion increased in the upper levels where it was clearly the ware in normal use. A further feature of the development was that the quality of the Class II pottery worsened at the top. It became more gritty, and was badly surfaced. This appearance of inferior quality was increased by the accidental factor 30 The study was carried out independently by Professor O'Kelly and myself and our conclusions as to sequence were the same,</page><page sequence="47">? E?okdXin?Lough Gur Excavations. 343 that the pottery suffered more where it was more lightly covered, but apart from the matter of inferior preservation there was a positive deterioration of quality. Grits tended to be larger and more numerous causing a deterioration of the body of the pottery and a less uniform surface. The interaction in the matter of technique of Class I and Class II has already been remarked on. Some sherds of Class I pots were of the coarse fabric appropriate to Class II, while some of Class II showed rim features such as belong to Class I. Beaker and Food Vessel sherds were not numerous but their occurrence below the gravel layer gave useful chronological indications. It is clear that both types came into use during the occupation of the site. That they are contemporary is merely another instance of a fact that has been noted on several sites at Lough Gur or in the neighbourhood ?on the Grange stone circle,36 on the Bathjordan barrows37 as well as on others of the Knockadoon habitation sites. Crucible. A fragment of the rim of a crucible (Fig. 20: 33) was found with the piece of Food Vessel (21) and some Class II sherds, at a high level ?above the gravel layer. Stone. Hammer or "mace" (Fig. 21). The most interesting of the stone objects is a portion?almost half?of a perforated hanimer of a dose grained dioritic stone. The surface is well polished and the perforation is of markedly hour-glass type. In the drawing of the object the reconstructed form is shown as symmetrical and the implement is discussed on this basis ; thei profile flattens on the sides and faces at the perforation and suggests this form rather than one which expanded or contracted at the missing end. The possibility of an asymmetrical shape?perhaps of an axe-hammer cannot be completely excluded, however. Assuming that the drawing is correct the length of the stone hammer would be 118 mm. ; its breadth and thickness are 60 mm. and 37 mm., respectively. The implement appears to belong to what has been referred to as the "barrelnshaped" type.38 The examples described by Mr. Coghlan in the paper here noted all differ from the Site C specimen in having cylindrical borings. Dating evidence in relation to the type in Great Britain and Ireland varies. One, with more rounded ends, was found in a grave of the Wessex culture (Bush Barrow, Normanton, Wilts.) another came from a grave of similar date in Towthorpe Barrow C. 39, s*P.R.I.A., 54C (1951), 70. ** J.C.H.A.S., 53 (1948), 28. 38 Coghlan in J.R.S.A.I., 75 (1945), 253.

East Riding Yorks, while two others were associated with Late Bronze Age vessels (Largs, Ayrshire and Stirling).39 These six examples also had cylindrical borings and the one from Largs was decorated with a concentric moulding around the opening. Similar but more developed forms (Mr. Coghlan's "pestle" type) are well known from megalithic Fig. 21.?Site C: Stone hammer (?). contexts, as are also the small stone beads made in imitation of them.40 The hour-glass boring of the Site C hammer would suggest, though it does not definitely prove41, an earlier date than that of the hammers with cylindrical borings. The hammer was found in the gravel layer on 80 References will be found in the papers cited in the previous footnote.

On considerations of typology it appears reasonable that this specimen would be at home in a Beaker context. It is uncertain whether it was intended for practical use?perhaps for sheet metal working as Mr. Maryon suggests42?or was a ceremonial object, so justifying the name "mace" applied to so many related types. In favour of the latter is the fact that the hour-glass boring would preclude the use of a stout shaft. Axes and axe chips (Fig, 22). Of the axes found only one (1) w&amp;s approximately complete. Others (2, 3, 4, 5) and two examples not illustrated were broken across near the middle. The complete implement (1) has an asymmetrical long section which identifies it as an adze rather than an axe. Some examples (6, 7) show excellently the process of chipping the surface of polished axes?something which occurred commonly on these sites. The chipping was presumably carried out on axes which had become damaged, the chips being then used as scrapers. From this site there are nearly eighty chips of varying sizes obtained in this way; a selection are illustrated (Fig. 22: 8-21). That they are derived from axes can be recognised by reason of the portions of polished surfaces which remain. The edges of many of the fragments are serrated as a result of their use as scrapers. From those specimens, where sufficient of the axe remains to give the cross-section, it can be noted that the cross-sections vary. Some are a broad oval, others a narrow oval while others have pointed sections. The broad oval is slightly more popular than the other forms. The material used was greenstone or a fine-grained dark stone, the former being more usual. Beads (Fig. 23). Twenty stone beads were found. These are mainly flat disc-shaped beads with hour-glass or slightly tapering perforations which are usually only large enough to take a string of small diameter. In one (7) the perforation is larger, causing the bead to be of ring form; another (8) has two small perforations. Several of the beads are about 14 mm. in diameter but others are larger (No. 19 being 30 mm. in diameter) while some (15, 16) are minute (about 7 mm. diameter) and have correspondingly small perforations. A different type of bead (20) has an hour-glass perforation at either end, both broken. The cross-section is that of a flattened ellipse. The size of this object (length 54 mm.) suggests that it may not be a bead; it may have served as a wrist-bracer though, if so, the type is unusual,43 A stone similarly provided with perforation at each end is figured by Leisner ;44 it is longer than ours and the cross-section is not asymmetrical. ^P.R.I.A., 44 (1938), 186. 43 An object which, it is suggested, was a wrist-bracer, was found in the excavation of the Longstone Rath, near Naas. It has a single perforation at each end. P.R.I.A., 30 C (1913), 355. ** Du Megalithgr?ber der Iberischen Halbinsel, Berlin, 1943, Taf. 50, C : 8. PROC. R.I.A., VOL. 56, SECT.

This hole could have been used to take the tang of some object such as an awl and the most likely suggestion is that the stone was intended for use as a handle. Two similar objects came from Carraig Aille II fort and one from Carraig Aille I.45 The Carraig Aille Fig. 24.?Site C: Whetstones (?). examples may be earlier objects found by chance on these sites ; the Site C specimen was found under the level of the upper paving where the latter ran through the wall south of House I.

One (5) has grooves such as could have been produced by sharpening pins?a feature common on whetstones from later sites; it was found near the surface on the south-east of the site. Rubbing stones. Two larger stones (PL XLVIII : 1, 2) the former rubbed slightly concave on one surface, the latter rubbed on both flat faces were found on old ground level. Like other specimens from Site D it is likely that they were used for the manufacture of stone axes. Flint and Chert (Fig. 25). In relation to the area excavated and the intensity of the occupation the amount of flint was not large. About two hundred pieces were found ; this number includes small fragments and waste pieces. Much of the flint came from small pebbles and in general suggests a meagre and unsatisfactory supply. This supply was eked out by the use of chert of which there are about sixty pieces. Of the objects of flint and chert the most carefully fashioned are the arrow-heads of which there are thirteen from this site and it is notable that eight of these are of chert showing that this material, even if also in limited supply, was more satisfactory in quality than was the available flint. One of the flint arrowheads (13) is of the Beaker barbed-and-tanged type, the others (9-12) are leaf-shaped and are broad in proportion to their length. One of the chert examples (1) is similar, two (2, 3) are flat:based the others are long and narrow. One (8) which was found in the surface turf has a poorly fashioned tang providing some similarity with the later Bronze Age type of tanged arrow-head. A tanged chert point, illustrated with the quartz on Plate XXII, is sufficiently small to merit the description microlithic.

Tanged microlithic points are not usual on the Knockadoon sites though some did occur in the barrows at Rathjordan in this neighbourhood.46 The fine chipping which characterises the arrow-heads is otherwise best shown on the round scrapers. Of those illustrated five (14-18 are of chert, the remainder (19-40) of flint. They vary in regularity of outline and fineness of workmanship. Some are approximately circular and are steeply chipped to form the edge (14 and 19); others are crudely chipped and haphazard in outline. A hollow scraper with finely serrated edge (41) is the only example of this type. The remainder of the flints are either waste pieces or blades or points of varying forms. Some of the points (42, 43) with strongly marked central ridge and curved outline are in the Bann flake tradition. Also showing Mesolithic survival are the small narrow blades (44-50), some of which (47, 50) have fine secondary chipping along the edges ; other small blades (52-56) are more irregularly shaped. A selection of blades of larger size are illustrated. In several of these (e.g. 57, 58, 63) portion of the cortex of the pebble remains. Some are pointed to serve as perforators (68, 71, 72), many have secondary chipping along the edges. A few examples (58, 64) of end scrapers occur. Quartz (PI. XXII). About one hundred and fifty pieces of quartz crystal were found. They are not all worked but the majority are either* shaped as implements or are waste fragments left over from the fashioning of points from crystals. As drawings are given in the case of quartz finds from other sites, a selection of those from Site C is illustrated by photographs. The selection shows not only points in finished form, but also discarded fragments and the larger pieces of crystal from which the implements were chipped. Bone (Pig. 26). Points and Pins. These form the majority of the bone objects from this site. There are about two hundred and twenty pointed bones, showing varying degrees of finish. Most are rather flat pieces cut from ribs or long bones47 and roughly brought to a point at one end. Some are pointed at both ends and since many of those pointed at one end only have irregularly broken surfaces at the broad end it is likely that the double-pointed type was originally better represented. When a round bone is cut so as to remove a piece diagonally from it, 46 J.C.H.A.S., 53 (1948), plate III. 47 Long bones and ribs of ox were most usual, long bones of sheep next in popularity, while pig fibula was used in a few cases.</page><page sequence="56">352 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. the result is an object of the type variously referred to as a bone "gouge'' or "scoop*' (16-20). These are frequently found on Early Christian sites ;48 they are also well known from the Early Iron Age, but the type can be found in much earlier contexts.40 Several of the examples from Site C came from near old ground level so that the type must be regarded as of early occurrence there. The difference between this series and that from later sites appears to be a difference of proportion; in the earlier series the obliquely cut round bone is rare* the flat pointed bone being the usual type, while on the later sites the " gouge' ' class; is typical, A series of bone points strikingly similar to ours is represented on the Almerian site Campos50 though the fully developed "gouge" form seems to be absent. Bone "gouges" have, however, been found in megalithic tombs in the Iberian peninsula.51 Some of the bone points were rounded (26, 27, 28) in cross-section and more definitely merited being regarded as pins. A few of this type of point were of horn (29) or antler (30). Few of the implements are perforated. One pin (22) has a hole near the head, another (21) is incompletely bored. Three flat pieces (23, 24, 25) are perforated. One of these (24) is double pointed and the hole is off-centre. It is possible it served as a primitive form of fish-hook of the type known as a "gorge".52 An unusual point is No. 31 in which the upper portion narrows to form a tang. Beads (Fig. 26). Five bone heads, of which three (34, 35, 36) are illustrated, were found. These were of simple annular form made by being cut from a long bone of circular cross-section; a bone in process of manufacture into beads was found on Site D. A bone from Site C (38) shows a cut end and may be a piece left over from bead-making. One broken bead (37) hasi a flatter cross-Section and has two small perforations between the central one and the edge. This piece and the cut bone (38) were found at high levels ; the other beads mentioned were found under the gravel, some near old ground level. Also from a high level (in the gravel layer) came the more ornate bead (39) which has decoration of zig-zag lines. An Early Christian date is likely. Top (?) (40). This object is shaped like a spinning top though very small ; a bone peg is inserted through the central axis. Again this was found in the gravel layer and may certainly be accepted as late. 48 For instance, at Carraig Aille, P.R.I.A., 52 C (1949), 83; reference is given to the Maiden Castle report where there is discussion of the Iron Age series. ?

Perforated plaque (32). This is a rectangular piece of bone slightly curved in cross-section. Near the middle are two perforations across which the bone is cracked. Thie surface is marked along the edges evidently by burning, giving a scalloped effect. Fragments of comb. Three fragments (33) evidently part of the side piece of a three-piece bone comb. The ornament, of closely-set parallel incised lines, is different from the usual ornament on bone combs. Such combs usually occur in Early Christian contexts, though a fragment of one came from Ring-Fort 5 at Cush.53 The Site C pieces were found at a high level in the wall collapse at the south-west corner of the enclosing wall. There is, therefore, no indication that they have anything to do with the early material from the site, Bear claw. A claw of a bear (41) was found ; it had been perforated perhaps for use as an amulet. The perforation, 5 mm. in diameter, is cylindrical and very clearly cut. Antler ring (Fig. 29: 13). A ring formed from the base of a red deer antler came from a high level. A fragment of a similar ring was found in Carraig Aille I fort at Lough Gur54 and it was suggested that it was used as a terret. Lignite (Fig. 26). Of five pieces of lignite bracelets of varying cross-sections (four illustrated), two were found under the gravel layer, the others on or in it. The two from the lower level (1, 2) showed signs of having been worked after being broken. One (1) is perforated near one end and tapers towards the other; the second piece (2) has a piece cut from the side near one end. Fragments from above the gravel floor also show signs of cut ends (3).. The small number of finds and these indications of repair or re-use go to show that the material was not in plentiful supply. Some of the fragments from above the gravel may be later chance finds on the site, but the occurrence of two pieces at a low level show that lignite was being used during the occupation. Glass. Beads (Fig. 26 and PL XXXVI : b). Five beads and six fragments of beads were found. All the complete beads and four of the fragments are of similar material?a greenish-blue glass?and will be treated first; the other two examples are decorated beads of types which must be ascribed to dates not earlier than Iron Age times and these will be described below.

R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 355 of Dr. J. F. S. Stone, f.s.a., to whom some of the Knockadoon beads were submitted and who kindly arranged to have a sample examined spectrographically. When our correspondence on the Knockadoon beads began, Dr. Stone was engaged on his report on the beads from Knackyboy, Scilly Islands, and this he was good enough to let me see in typescript.55 This report includes a review of the occurrence of glass beads in Bronze Age contexts on the Continent and in Great Britain ; as the report is now published it is not necessary to repeat here all the references given in it. The Knockadoon beads of greenish-blue glass are small, the smallest (1) being only 5 mm. in diameter, the largest about twice this size. Of the nine finds in this group, eight were found on or in the gravel layer. One (3) was found beneath it?about one inch above old ground level with Beaker and Class II pottery. The small size is a reason for caution in the matter of the stratigraphical evidence, since such an object could have slipped down through the soil, or, notwithstanding the utmost care, might have slipped during the excavation. The recurrence of the same type of bead on others of the Knockadoon sites,56 however, argues that they do belong to the occupation of these sites and that they cannot be regarded as adventitious strays. While the colour of all these beads is, as has been stated, a greenish blue, the shade varies somewhat due to slight variation in the quality of the glass or in the degree of corrosion of the surface. In some of the beads the method of manufacture may be recognised by reason of the sharp projections which show that the bead was produced by what Beck57 has called the wire-wound method. This means that a thin stick of glass heated to the consistency of toffee was wound round a wire. The projections (there may be one or two evident on each bead) reveal the ends where the glass was pulled out into a thread before being broken off. This feature of the Knockadoon beads has led Dr. Stone to indicate some very interesting parallels. The first two parallels come from Egypt ; beads of the same wire-wound method of manufacture and of similar small size come from Late XVIII Dynasty contexts on two Egyptian sites Abydos (specimen from Egyptian Exploration Fund, 1913, presumably dated about 1400 b.c.) and Amarna (specimen from Egyptian Exploration Society, 1924, dated 1380-1350 b.c.). Samples of these beads were obtained from the Bristol Museum and a photograph was kindly supplied by Dr. Stone (PI. XXXVI : 6) to illustrate the similarity between the Lough Gur and Abydos beads. One of the beads from the latter site was sent to me and is closely comparable with ours in size and shape and in the evidence for the wire-wound method of manufacture. 6&amp;Now published in Ant.

Its colour is a lighter blue, and I understand that this is also true of the colour of the other Egyptian beads which are otherwise similar to ours. Wire-wound beads which provide parallels to those from Lough Gur were found in France. In a cave at Treille (Mailhac, Aude)58 eight beads of this type were found with fragments of Beaker (some of which has cord ornament and some the narrow ladder ornament, noted also on many sherds from Lough Gur and neighbouring sites). Among the other finds were bronze buttons with double perforations, amber beads and a rectangular spacing bead of faience. Glass beads of similar type came from an excavation conducted by M. Pierre Temple in the Grotte Landric, St. Baulize, Aveyron. These are said to have been of Hallstatt date, but as publication of the site is not available the dating may not be definite. Again beads of the same type were found in dolmens in the Aveyron.59 The following report of spectrographic analysis of a fragment of bead from Knockadoon (Find number 213, Site C, 1949) and of specimens from Egypt and France is supplied by Dr. Stone, whose commentary on the result is appended. The results of the analysis were :?

But unfortunately we do not know where this could have been. The Egyptian specimens, though similar in shape and method of manufacture, are clearly different in composition. But of course in the absence of knowledge we cannot rule out Egypt or the Near East as we do not know the variation in composition of glasses from other sources and countries. I must say I should have been surprised if either of the Egyptian specimens had turned out to be exactly the same; their colour you will recall was different. And out of the many thousands of millions made in Egypt it would have been a coincidence if I had picked out one of the same composition. In general it must be noted that until recently there was no good evidence for the occurrence of glass beads on the Continent prior to the Late Bronze Age,60 but in addition to the French finds we have noted 58 H. Martin, O. and J. Taffanel and J. Arnal, " La Cueva de la Treille (Mailhac, Aude) ", Ampurias, XI (L949), 25. 69 The Landric beads and those from the dolmens were reported to Dr. Stone in a letter from Monsieur Jean Arnal. 60 Reinecke, Altertumer unseren heidnischen Vorzeit, V (Mainz), 1911, 60. Reinecke, however, allows for the possibility of glass beads in Neolithic contexts (possibly in the Bandkeramik culture) because of their early use in Egypt.</page><page sequence="61">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 357 there are also examples from an Aunjetitz grave at Melk in Austria61 and from a "Dagger Grave" at Landivision in Finist?re.62 There are various references to the occurrence of glass beads in Early and Middle Bronze Age contexts in Britain, but the finds are suspect either because of doubts as to the find circumstances or because of uncertainty in the older descriptions as to whether true glass or faience is in question. There is definite evidence for a Late Bronze Age date in the case of some bead finds from Scotland, and the recent discovery from Knackyboy Cairn is likewise dated to Late Bronze Age or to a Middle Late transitional date.63 In Ireland there has been a tendency to treat any find of a glass bead as not earlier than Early Iron Age times and this has led to a circular argument?that since beads must be Iron Age or later they must be explained away if they appear in earlier contexts. Admittedly the finds are not always satisfactory, but they are worthy of mention. There are instances of the finding of glass beads in megalithic tombs; they occurred at Sliabh na Caillighe and Dowth, but since late material came from the same sites the finds cannot be accepted as primary; in a megalith at Carnduff, Co. Antrim,64 from which came pottery of Neolithic type, a blue glass bead was found according to Wood-Martin,65 In the case of a blue glass bead from the basal layer under the megalithic cairn at Aghnaskeagh, Co. Louth, there is no doubt as to the find circumstances;66 the excavation report insists on the accurate obser vation of its stratigraphical position, but postulates an Iron Age date and suggests that the position of the bead is due to its having been introduced from above, intentionally or by slip. A recent find of a tiny glass bead similar to some of ours is from Mr. Mogey's excavation of a bank-and-ditch enclosed ritual site at Mullaghmore, Co. Down. Pottery from this site appears to be of Bronze Age date but can hardly be defined more closely. The finds mentioned, though not all satisfactory, do provide some indications of the early occurrence of glass beads. These indications are 61 Praehistorische Zeitschrift, 25 (1934), 144. 62 P.P.S., 5 (1939), 193. 63 In this connexion Dr. Stone writes : " Since the publication of my remarks on the Knackyboy Cairn beads I have been reading ' Prosymna ' by C. W. Biegen (C.U.P. 1937). The Late Helladic glass beads (dated 1600-1200 b.c.) from that site appear so similar in shape, size and colour to the Scilly Islands specimens that I shall not be at all surprised to find later that our glass beads in Western Europe may well be of Mycenean origin; or at any rate disseminated from Mycenae. This would at least bring them into line as regards date with the faience trade ". 64 Preliminary Survey.Northern Ireland, 33, with references. ?s Pagan Ireland, 299. 66 E. Estyn Evans, " Excavations at Aghnaskeagh, Co. Louth, Cairn A ", C.L.A.J., 8 (1935), 241, states : " There can be no doubt whatsoever as to its horizon for apart from our caution in observing levels the plug of brown earth in the hole of the bead provided independent proof; the layer above was black. We were startled to see the bead coming from the basal layer of a megalith."</page><page sequence="62">358 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. strengthened by the continental discoveries and they are in accord with the a priori argument that glass beads as well as faience could have been imported from some source in the Mediterranean area or from some secondary centre of manufacture on the Continent at an early date. We see no reason, therefore, for refusing to accept the stratigraphical evidence of the Site C bead that came from below the gravel floor, a position which indicated a date not later than the Beaker period. While there is not the same stratifigraphical evidence in the case of the other beads, it is possible that some at least belong to the period of occupation of the site. We shall note the occurrence of further examples of the same type on others of the sites. The two beads, mentioned above as differing from the greenish-blue group and probably intrusive, have each decoration. One is somewhat darker in colour (more green) than most of the beads dealt with. The glass is thin and the surface is very corroded. The pattern consists of concentric circles containing a corroded white inlay. The other decorated fragment comes from a large bead of yellow glass with white concentric lines lightly inset on the surface. Blab of glass. This is of dark glass and evidently came from a molten mass as the surface is smoothly rounded. It came from above the gravel floor and is not of the same type of glass as that in any of the beads, but is somewhat similar to the dark glass (amber when the light shines through it) in the stud to be described next. Glass blob and stud were found about six feet apart on the western side of the site. Stud (Fig. 26: 7). The glass stud (found in the gravel layer) is evidently of Early Christian date. It is small (diameter 9 mm., thickness 4 mm.), circular with a flat base and a dome-shaped top. The design on the top is in three colours; the five petals of the design are yellow, the small triangular pieces between them are white, as is also the thin circular band around the top, while the remainder is blue. Glass studs consisting of glass of a basic colour with insertions of one or more colours are known from Irish material of Early Christian date. Some of the croziers and the Cross of Cong give good examples, and,the technique, sometimes with the addition of a metal grille, was used at an earlier stage on studs on the Tara brooch and the Ardagh chalice. The marigold pattern on our Site C stud is not paralleled in this material; it occurs early in Irish art in stone and bronze67 and a somewhat similar design may be noted on parchment?on a pendant roundel which hangs from one of the capitals in the Manuscript of the Prophets (Paris, Biblioth?que nationale, Latin 9382, Fol. 109 v.) from, the monastery of Echternach. This manuscript probably belongs to the early 8th century, but on the basis of such a simple design it would be rash to date the stud too closely. 67 See examples figured by Clapham, Antiquity, 8 (1934), 48.</page><page sequence="63">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 359 Silver. Coins (Fig. 27). Two silver coins found have been examined by Dr. W. O'Sullivan, National Museum of Ireland, who kindly supplies the identifications. One is a silver penny struck by Plegmund, Archbishop of Canterbury (890-914). The inscription reads?obverse : Plegmund Archiep (legend between two concentric circles, in centre a small cross pattee); reverse: Wilrc Mo, the name and title of the moneyer, probably a blundered rendering of Wulfric (group of three pellets above and below, three small crosses pattee across centre). Only half of the second coin remains. It is a silver penny of Edward the Elder (901 or 900-925). The full inscription would read (Eadv)veard Re(x), of which the letters not in parenthesis are left (legend between two circles, in centre remains of cross pattee). The inscription on the reverse, the name of the moneyer, appears to be Erihp, but Dr. O'Sullivan believes that it may be a rendering of Erinw(ald) (sometimes spelled Ernwald), known moneyer of Edward the Elder. Above the name are three pellets and below there are traces of three small crosses. The dates of the coins are sufficiently close to suggest that both were lost at the same time. The Canterbury penny was found on the stones of the enclosing wall at the south-western corner of the site, the other about thirty feet to the north-east in a pocket in the stony material. Fragment of silver. A scrap of silver, irregular in outline, about 2 cm. across, was found on the gravel layer on the western side of the site. Lead. A small lead disc (not illustrated) about 17 mm. in diameter with impressed hollow on one side was found on the gravel layer at the western side of the site. Bronze (Fig. 28).

The bronzes found under the layer will be dealt with first. Part of blade (1). This fragment (about 18 mm. in length) is broken from the tip of a blade. It is too small to allow one to decide the type of bjade from which it comes. Pins. The complete pin (2)?length 5 cm.-?has a circular head, the edges of the flat surface of which are curved up to give a cupped shape. The head was apparently produced by beating the metal at the top of the head until it swelled out sufficiently, the thin edges being then turned up to form a slight flange around the top. Pins of this type are not Fio. 28,?Site C: Bronze objects (1).</page><page sequence="65">? R?ord?in?Lough Gut Excavations. 361 frequent in the published material and none with the slightly cupped top has, to my knowledge, been published. What are fittingly described as "nail-headed pins" are known from the Late Bronze Age?Hallstatt layer at Scarborough68 and again from Heathery Burn Cave, Durham;09 in both cases the illustrated examples are about twice the size of ours. Pins of the same form in bone are known from Denmark where they occur in the "dagger period" material. A gold nail-headed pin, again about twice the size of ours, is figured by Armstrong;70 it is said to have been found with a gold sun-disc at Ballyvourney, Co. Cork. While the associated material at Heathery Burn and Scarborough points to a Late Bronze Age date, the sun-disc at Ballyvourney would indicate the Early or Early Middle Bronze Age. It is possible that the type has a long life71 and also that such pins are of more frequent occurrence than the number of published examples suggests. Broken pin (3). This piece may be portion of a pin similar to No. 2, but the head is missing. Awl (4). This implement has at one end a sharp point and round cross-section. The section becomes rectangular higher up and changes to a heavier rectangular sectioned portion which flattens towards the other end. Because the heavier portion is more highly corroded it appears likely that this was the tang which was inserted in a wooden handle, the pointed end being the one which was in use. The flattening of the tang would have served to keep it from turning in the wooden handle. Awls of this type occur in various chronological contexts,72 As Childe remarks 73 they are amongst "the oldest metal objects in any context in Britain," though they survive at least as late as the Late Bronze Age. Fragments. Six small fragments of bronze were found under the gravel floor. Five of these are short lengths which may be portions of pins, awls or (in two instances where they are slightly curved) of rings. The sixth is a small (diam. 7 mm.) circular disc, flat in front, with a protuberance near the edge at the back. It may be a small "jet" from casting. Of the bronzes which occurred in or above the gravel floor, some (pins and an awl) are similar to those which have been described and are possibly contemporary with them, others are obviously much later. 68 Archaeologia, 77 (1927), 181. 69 Evans, Ancient Bronze Implements, 365. 70 Catalogue of Irish Gold Ornaments, No. 449. 71 A somewhat similar example occurred at Cahercommaun (Extra. Volume, R.S.A.I., 1938, p. 34). It apparently has not a cupped head. 72 0'Kelly gives references in J.C.H.A.S., 56 (1951), 83. 73 Prehistoric Communities of the British Mes.

One of the pins (5) is complete. It is shorter (length 41 mm.) than the one found under the gravel, but is otherwise quite similar. Several pointed fragments are illustrated, some of which (6, 7) may be portions of similar pins; others (8, 10, 11), which are heavier, may be pieces of awls. Awl. One complete awl (9) was found. It is bent and at one side of the bend the awl has a round cross-section; towards the other end it is four-sided. Knife (12). This fragment of a knife-blade has a single rivet hole for the haft. It is evidently portion of a small knife-dagger, possibly somewhat more than half of which is missing. It was found just under the turf at a depth of 5" towards the north-western corner of the site. Knife (13). This implement, found in two pieces, is a knife with a broad tang in which there is a single perforation for a rivet. The surface is considerably corroded, and in the corrosion a curved outline, the convex side towards the blade, shows the position of the end of the haft. On the portion which would have been inserted into the haft there are indications of the grain of the wood. There are, on several parts of the surface, similar impressions of the grain of some organic substance, but these run in various directions, usually diagonally, and are evidently the impression of either a criss-crossed binding or of a sheath made of interwoven strands.74 The present outline of the blade clearly results from use and repeated sharpening, hence the asymmetrical shape, which suggests a single-edged implement, may be fortuitous and the cross section favours its having been double-edged. Good parallels for this type do not appear to be forthcoming in the published material, but its form seems best explained as an adaptation on a very reduced scale of a bronze rapier. The hilt is, however, better paralleled by the Late Bronze Age knife from Heathery Burn,75 though this has a narrow raised ridge on either side instead of a rivet-hole for fastening. Razor. A tanged blade (14) is of a very unusual type, since the blade is a separate piece inserted into the split tang and "cast on" in position. Mr, Maryon, who has kindly examined the object, supplies the following note: "I had not seen another of quite this shape before. There are no traces of riveting, but the metal of which the handle is formed was not high enough in temperature, or sufficient in bulk, to fuse much of the blade. I think that the tang is really fused, but for the next half-inch the hot metal ran over the surface without penetrating much. The smith hammered it into close contact and his work stood the test of time. The surface of the blade may be seen through a bubble hole in the ?" 74 Dr. P. O'Connor, National Museum, agrees that the pattern on the surface is caused by contact with some plant material for which, however, he is unable to suggest an identity.

This blade, which has a hard smooth green patination, may be referred to as a knife or a razor, but it is sufficiently similar to examples usually accepted as razors to be included with these. It agrees in general with Mrs. Piggott's Class I76 in which many (and especially the Scottish and Irish, ornamented examples) have well-developed tangs.77 The available evidence favours a Late Bronze Age date for these razors and the unusual technique of manufacture of the Site C example does not provide a criterion at variance with this since we know that the process of &lt;?casting-on,, was used on other implements of the Late Bronze Age.78 The razor and the knife (608) were found at a high level; the knife (depth 12") was in the gravel layer, and the razor (depth 7") was immediately under the turf. Socketed Axe (15). A rather small (length 68 mm.) socketed axe was found in the humus (depth 4") near the south-eastern corner of the site. At the mouth is a rope-moulding made by means of a series of short diagonal grooves in a raised collar round the opening. On both sides, running from the mouth to the ends of the cutting-edge, are slight ridges which mark the meeting of the two halves of the mould in which the axe was cast. These ridges have been partly flattened by hammering and it appears likely that the axe was lost soon after manufacture and before the finishing process was completed. Within the socket, at the middle of the cutting edge and at right-angles to it, is a very short ridge. This feature is frequent on Irish axes though it is usually longer and more pronounced.79 Brooch (18). In this brooch the turned back foot and bow are completely fused, but the reminiscence of the earlier (La T?ne II) type is retained in the line which marks the point of juncture. The pin is missing but it is clear that the method of its attachment to the bow was unusual. Instead of the usual arrangement in which bow, coil and pin were continuous, there is near the end of the bow a small rivet which projects slightly on the inside but is flush with the surface on the outside. This held the pin in position, but whether the spring depended on the flexibility of the metal only or on a coil we have no means of knowing. One brooch in the National Museum (no details of find-place available) 7? P.P.S., 12 (1946), 121-141. 77 The same form and long tang are found on the implement from Calais Wold, Yorkshire (Mortimer, Forty Years, 169-170, PI. LV, fig. 428), to which Mrs. Piggott refers as a two-edged knife, though why the distinction is made between this and the u razors " is not clear. 7? Maryon in P.R.I.A., 44 C (1938), 185. 7? Wilde (Catalogue, 383) believed these ridges marked the joinings of the core-pieces. They seem more likely to have been derived from grooves in the core intended to prevent it from slipping during the casting. PROC. R.I.A., VOL. 56, SECT. C. [2 H 21</page><page sequence="68">364 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. is very similar in shape of foot and catch-plate. One coil of a spring is riveted to the ?brooch, in this case by means of two rivets instead of the single rivet of the Site C example; the bow of the National Museum example also turns upwards towards the spring. This type of brooch appears to be a native adaptation of the transitional La T?ne II-III type. Dr. Raftery has pointed out to me that such simplifications of the spring mechanism are found on several of the Iron Age Irish brooches (of which the number recorded is small). Tentatively a date about the first century b.c. might be suggested for the Site C brooch. It was found near the middle of the southern edge of the excavated area. It lay at a depth of 12" in humus at a place where the gravel layer did not exist. Pin (16). A long (length 95 mm.) pin with a loop at the top is evidently the pin of a ring-pin, possibly of Early Christian date. It was found, at the eastern extremity of the site, on the gravel layer under very shallow turf, depth 2". Ring1 of ring-pin (19). This small ring (diam. 12 mm.) of a ring-pin is made of thin metal plate, and has a decoration of transverse grooves on the front. A notch provides a narrow part which would have been held in the pin. This ring may belong to the pin (16) or to a similar example. It also was found on the eastern side of the site on the gravel at a depth of 3" about 16' from the find-place of the pin. Rings. Two rings, one (20) complete, the other (21) broken, are plain. The broken one was found in the humus, the other was embedded in the gravel layer. Ornamented object. This object (22) is a piece of a bronze strip, expanded at one end and ornamented with a design of straight lines. On the expanded part there is portion of a design of short parallel lines. The date and purpose of the object are problematical?it was found above the gravel layer. Hook with ring (23). A thin strip of bronze has been doubled into the form of a hook with a loop at one end and small perforations at the other. One of the perforations is incomplete and does not coincide with the other. A small ring is held in the loop of the strip. The object was found just over the gravel layer and no estimate can be given of its age. It looks rather like a modern curtain fitting but for the irregularity of the workmanship. Various pieces. A strip of bronze (17) shows signs of hammering on edges and faces. The thickness decreases towards both ends, one of which is rounded, the other broken. At the rounded end the hammering has caused the outline to become slightly spatulate as if it were intended to make the piece into a small gouge. A piece of metal plate curved almost to tubular form (24) appears to be brass and may be modern.</page><page sequence="69">? R?ordain?Lough Gut Excavations. 365 The bronze specimens from the upper levels of Site C include a number of small pieces which are not illustrated. Among these are a few formless fragments which are evidently waste from bronze casting. There are two thin, circular, domed pieces (diameter 7 mm.) with central perforations which may have served as washers for rivets, and another very thin piece, also domed, which may have been the cover of a rivet head. Iron (Fig. 29). About eighty pieces of iron were found at varying depths?in and above the gravel floor, in the material of the enclosing wall or in its collapse and in the humus. As already pointed out it cannot be held that the iron is in true association with the wall, and no iron object occurred under the gravel layer. Most of the iron objects cannot be accurately dated, but there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the chronological range represented is a wide one. The material is evidently derived from sporadic activity on the site at different dates?ranging from at least as early as Early Christian times to probably as' late as the nineteenth century. Two horse-shoes found have been examined by Mr. P. Nyhan, National Museum, who believes that one, which is illustrated (1), is of sixteenth century type, while a light shoe (not illustrated) is thought to date from the early nineteenth century. Eleven iron knives or fragments of knives were found. Of the selection illustrated most are of the type found commonly on Early Christian sites (4-6), but one (2) with long blade and remains of socketed end, may be of much later date?it is similar to one of sixteenth-century type from the houses excavated at Caherguillamore.80 About thirty nails are represented. Some with large heads are probably ancient?Early Christian or Mediaeval, but more definite dating is not possible. Among the other iron pieces are fragments of pins including two loops of ring-headed pins (10, 11), a twisted point (3), which may be modern, and a stud (12). Other pieces which are not illustrated include a staple, portion of a small wall-brad, a small irregularly square washer and a number of unrecognisable fragments. A piece of iron slag about 70 mm. in diameter and two small fragments were found. Animal Bones. The quantity of animal bones (28 sacks full) from this site was very large ; this was due to two factors?the limestone soil which preserved the bones and the intensity of the occupation of the site. &amp;OJ.R.S.AJ., 72 (1942), 52.</page><page sequence="70">366 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Ox accounted for the bulk of the finds?about 95%, while pig formed less than 4% and the remainder were mainly sheep (or goat). Other animals were represented by only a few bones in each case and are as follows :?Horse : one tooth in portion of mandible. Dog (or wolf) : fragments of various bones, about twenty-four teeth, and coprolites; the fragments do not allow a decision between dog and wolf, but the finding of Fig. 29.?Site C: Iron and antler (13) objects (?). several coprolites suggest that domestic dogs were kept. Cat: three instances of the distal portion of the hum?rus. Bear: perforated claw (dealt with under Bone), three teeth and three toe bones. Eed deer : two fragments of antler. Rabbit : various bones. Birds : the following are represented (each by only one bone unless otherwise indicated)?duck, sea eagle (4), goose (2), crane (3), raven (2), black-headed gull, fowl (2), teal,</page><page sequence="71">? R?ordain?Lough ?ur Excavations. m barn owl, great crested grebe, marsh harrier, coot, corncrake, duck (2), white-fronted goose. Fish : a few vertebrae. The occurrence of bear is of interest. Mr. Stelfox is inclined to doubt its contemporaneity with the occupation of the site and suggests as a possible explanation that the bones were collected in a neighbouring cave by the ancient inhabitants. However, bear was found also on Circle K (Windle) and the occurrence of a perforated claw is suggestive of contemporaneity. Again bear is shown to have been contemporary with man at Keshcorran, Co. Sligo,81 at Kesh, Co. Sligo,82 and at Bdenvale, Co. Clare.83 Human Remains. From various parts of the site fragments of human bone were collected with the animal bones and have been identified by Dr. Inkster as follows : ?five teeth (adult) ; one fragment doubtfully thought to be human femur; eighteen fragments of iimb bones most of which are definitely human and are from more than one child in first year of life; five fragments of thick skull vault, which appear to be human; the clavicle of a child?newborn or unborn. SITE C, 1949. As indicated above it was realised at the end of the 1940 excavations that further work was desirable at the northern side of Site C. It was found possible to continue work on the site in the summer of 1949. Pegs had been left in position in 1940 and when work was resumed these were found and the lines of the new excavation were arranged in relation to them. The southern extremity of the 1949 area lies along an east-west line which is parallel to and one foot north of the northern edge of the area excavated in 1940. The position of the pegs is marked on both plans so that the relationship of the two areas is clear. In the continuation of the excavation of Site C three objectives were before us?to discover the extent of the inhabited area here, to try to obtain further house-plans and to check the pottery sequence which had been observed in the course of the previous excavation. It became obvious in the course of the work that the whole of the inhabited area could not be uncovered, but it did prove possible to ascertain its limits. At the south a 6-metre wide east-west strip was investigated and a strip was opened at right-angles to it, this being continued up the hill-slope until the limit of the site was reached. In the plan which is reproduced here (PI. XXIII) the squares are given the same numeration as that assigned to them during the excavation, ?i P.R.I.A., 46 B (1940), 89. 82 T.R.I.A., 32 B (1902-4), 202. ?a T.R.I.A., 33 B (1906-7), 44.</page><page sequence="72">368 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. and it will be convenient to refer to particular portions of the excavation under these numbers. The numbers, it will be understood, follow the order in which the squares were opened, not the regular order of the relative position of the squares. Stones and wall fragments on old ground level are shown by continuous lines; those at higher levels are shown by broken lines. In square 21 where one wall overlies another the upper one is cross-hatched while the lower is hatched in one direction only. To the east the inhabited area was limited by a rocky shelf which was uncovered in square 7a and 18 and upon which limestone fragments lay in profusion. This shelf was a portion of the ridge of rock which ran north-south and gave protection to the whole site (PI. XXV : a). To the west the limit of the site was again reached at a rock surface (squares 1a and 15) which also appeared when the turf and humus were removed. To the north the inhabited area finally ceased at a point where the hill slope changed gradient and somewhat flattened out to the more level area above. Removal of the turf and the humus immediately under it did not generally reveal the gravel layer which was a feature of so much of the 1940 area. This appeared only in a small portion of the site?along a narrow (less than 1 m. wide) strip at the southern boundary of the excavation. Elsewhere the surface uncovered was more stony and over almost the whole site it had the appearance of cobbling (PI. XXVI : a) as in the north-west portion of Site C, 1940. Again this was not a deliberately-laid cobbled floor?some portions of such a floor were found at a deeper level and will be referred to below. The cobbled appearance was due to the consolidation of the stony debris which resulted from collapsed buildings and perhaps also from the more stony hill-wash on this part of the slope. This layer again served the same useful purpose as did the gravel and the cobbles in 1940; it sealed the underlying material and no late object was found beneath it. The average depth of deposit over the site was about 75 cm., though it was notably greater in places and was much deeper in some of the pits. In general the deposit consisted of dark soil with stones of various sizes. Bones and other evidences of habitation were found throughout the deposit while fragments of walls, small floor areas and hearths also occurred. As had been our experience in 1940, it was found impossible to obtain plans of the houses represented by these remains. Only short lengths of walls remained and these obviously belonged to several successive stages of re-building. For instance a wall ran diagonally north-west to south-east across square 17 at a high level ; when this wall was cleared a floor of well-packed clay and cobbles was found at a lower level, depth 75 cms. This floor covered most of the north-eastern half of the square but did not extend further. In this floor the cobbles had been set in a layer of yellow clay, this being the only example of a</page><page sequence="73">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 369 formally laid floor found on the site. The floor, however, extended under the wall, the latter being built on an accumulation (about 30 cm. in thickness) of debris over the floor. It is clear, therefore, that floor and wall fragments did not belong to the same house. Similarly in square 21 a portion of rough walling ran from the north eastern corner about half-way across the square and at its south-eastern end over-lay another wall fragment at right-angles to it. When these successive wall fragments were removed there was found under them a deep deposit of yellow clay containing an admixture of organic material below which was the earliest habitation layer upon undisturbed ground level. This layer of yellow clay was a feature of part of the northern portion of the site?in squares 21 and 22.* It was similar to the undisturbed clay and differed from it only in being slightly softer and darker?containing charcoal, other* organic matter and some finds. It was divided from the undisturbed material by a dark (brown) habitation layer which included a red burnt area. This (brown) dividing layer was not found everywhere?it appeared on the section face on the east of the cutting, but not on the western side. Examination of the eastern section, the relevant portion of which is reproduced (PI. XXIV), suggests an explanation for the yellow layer. Above its northern end (in square 22) a post-hole dug in the undisturbed clay, appears in the section and on the southern side of this the undisturbed clay shows a rise between a setting of stones. The southern edge of this feature approximately corresponds to a slight step in the original surface as shown on the plan while the post-hole in the section face corresponds with others which occur across the cutting. The whole has the appearance of the remains of a clay bank?possibly backed against wooden posts. The clay layers in squares 21 and 22 would represent the collapse of this bank which was, presumably, intended to give protection to the habitation from the north. Remains of the bank were to be distinguished in places only, as is shown by the difference between the eastern and western section faces. As will be seen from plan and section the bank, which we have argued crossed square 22, did not mark the northern limit of habitation, though it may have represented an earlier limit subsequently extended. Further north, habitation continued and there occurred here two very deep pits, in the northernmost of which was found the burial to be described below. Near the upper limits of the site (Extension B) were the remains of two walls which crossed the cutting and protruded to some extent above the grass surface. These were placed at a high level in the stratification and were not early features. They evidently served the same purpose at a later date as did the clay bank of square 22. Habitation material became very thin between these walls and finally ceased just north of the upper one.</page><page sequence="74">370 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Post-holes were found on most parts of the site, but as already noted, could be recognised on the old ground level only. One group of post-holes (PI. XXV : b) is notable in that it forms a satisfactory house-plan. It is marked as House III (Houses I and II being those of Site C, 1940), and occurs in squares 3, 4, 8, and 12. A total of about twenty-four post-holes give the plan of a circular house approximately 5 m. in diameter. The posts were comparatively light, the average diameter of the holes being about 15 cm. though one at the centre had a diameter of approximately 30 cm. Their depths varied from 10 to 20 cm. (the depth being measured from the level at which they were recognised). The post-holes did not follow a regular circle and in parts of the circumference they occurred in pairs or irregularly in multiple fashion. This was not a formal duplicating of the ring of posts as noted in Houses I and II, but rather a strengthening of the structure either at the time of building or in the course of subsequent repair. The major portion of the house appears on the plan and in any case sufficient to indicate its shape and size has been uncovered, but it is clear that the edge of the excavation on the south cuts off a small segment of the circle. It is likely that other post-holes here were covered by the 1' unexcavated strip which had been left between the northern edge of the 1940 excavated area and the southern edge of the 1949 excavation. Two small burnt areas appeared on the clay surface in House III, but neither could be claimed to be a formal hearth. In squares 9, 10, 25 and 26 there was a further concentration of post holes, but these did not fall into any sensible plan. At the southern end of square 11 the section shows a step in the yellow clay. This feature appears also in the plan and crosses the square obliquely, becoming deeper at the western section face. It is clear that the clay surface was cut down here and over part of squares 10 and 26. In this area Beaker fragments occurred not only at the top levels,? but also deep in the deposit and it appears likely that the scarping of the clay surface here was due to Beaker period activity. Pits dug in the clay were found on various parts of the site and differed considerably in size and depth. They were numerous to the east of House III and in these the depths varied from 16 to 37 cm., the average being about 30 cm. One, in the middle of square 16, of irregular outline had a hearth in a slightly sunken hollow at the south-eastern side and there was a second hearth in the fill of the pit on the north-eastern side. The pit, about 50 cm. in depth, contained the usual fill of dark material, but the hearth was represented by a layer of red burnt clay and ash about 7 cm. thick. This projected less than half-way across the pit and was 25 cm. over the bottom of it. The pits to the north were usually larger and deeper. The pit (PI. XXVI : b) which crossed from square 11A into square 20 was 53 cm.</page><page sequence="75">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 371 deep at the eastern side, but stepped up to a depth of 40 cm. at the western side, where a narrow channel connected it with another pit 36 em. deep. A roughly-constructed stone wall inserted in the fill had been built across the pit. Two especially large pits occurred in squares 23 and 24 respectively. The depth in each case was 110 cm. This measurement is, as in the case of the other pits and the post-holes, the depth from the surface of the undisturbed clay. Because of the thickness of the deposit here the depth from the present surface was much greater?approximately 2 m. in the case of each of these pits. The fill of the two large pits differed from that of the smaller ones in being largely yellow clay. It is clear that neither pit remained long open. They were partially filled after a short time, then habitation refuse (represented by the dark intermediate layer) accumulated over the partial filling, after which a further amount of yellowish clay was thrown in or silted into the upper portion of the pit. Burial in Pit in Square 24 (PI. XXVI : c). The purpose of these pits?large or small?is a matter of conjecture; the fact that a burial occurred in the pit in square 24 was evidently a secondary use of the pit, since there was no other example on the site of a pit being used for a burial. The lowest portion of this pit contained numbers of large stones. The clay around these stones was very similar to the undisturbed subsoil, but was lightly flecked with charcoal and was slightly more open than the undisturbed material. Near the bottom of the pit a skeleton appeared on the eastern side of the section-face. The cleaning of the surrounding area revealed a pot, apparently complete when deposited, but badly crushed by the weight of stones and clay above it. The excavation of skeleton and pot involved digging back into the section-face in the lower level of the pit ; the pot lay to the west of the section line. At the bottom of the pit a slight hollow had been scraped to take the burial. This hollow scarcely shows on the section but is indicated on the plan. The burial lay on its left side and was tightly flexed; the legs were drawn up clofce to the body. The right upper arm lay along the body while the forearm was near the legs. The left arm was more to the front, the hand being before the face. Professor E. Keenan informs me that the remains are those of a youth aged about fourteen years. There was no protective covering over the burial. It appears that the pit was, like the other pits on the site, dug for other purposes. While the pit was still fully open a hollow was made in the bottom of it in which the burial was placed, the pot being placed near the head. The pit was then partly filled, large stones being used near the bottom. A hollow still existed ; it subsequently filled in the lower levels with habitation material and then with more clay. The burial was about 2 m. under the</page><page sequence="76">372 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. present-day surface, though it was originally deposited in a pit 1 m. deep in which it was covered to a depth of 60 cm. The continuation of the excavation of Site C indicated that the area inhabited here was approximately 64 m. north-south and 30 m. east-west. Not all of this area was excavated, but sufficient has been done to reveal the character of the habitation. Round wooden houses at the earliest stage (represented by three examples) were replaced by houses built at least partly of stone with paved floors and accompanied by walls which gave an irregular terracing to the site and evidently provided (on the 1940 area) an attached yard. Habitation was limited by the rock on the east and its limits were reached at the edge of the excavated area on the west, north and south. Habitation was most intensive across the middle of the site where the 1940 and 1949 areas met. Finds. Pottery. About 3,500 sherds of pottery came from this site. As already mentioned, one of the purposes of the excavation was to check the pottery sequence which had been worked out in relation to the other house-sites. Since the northern end of the area excavated in 1940 produced the deepest stratification and a deep habitation deposit continued over most of the area excavated in 1949, except where rock outcropped at the extreme east and at the west, conditions were particularly favourable from the point of view of observing the pottery sequence. The results of the 1949 season were in complete agreement with those already observed. Although the gravel deposit which formed a sealing layer over most of the 1940 area did not extend further north, a similar purpose was served by the 1 'cobbling'' in 1949. A deposit of yellow clay noted in the northern extension of the site?squares 21 and 22?provided a horizon below which came pottery of Class I and la type only, no examples of Class II or Beaker being found. Similarly in squares 23 and 24, where further deposits of yellow clay overlay large pits (one of which contained the burial), pottery of Class I and la type only occurred beneath the yellow layer. This gives evidence of the earliest stage of occupation when pottery of Class I and la was in use, but prior to the introduction of Class II. The burial with its accompanying pot of la type belongs to this stage. Class I. Over 1,200 sherds of Class I and la pottery were found. The estimate of the quantity of these two types is given together, since it is only possible to recognise Class la when portion of the decorated rim or shoulder is present. Considerable variety in colour, texture and rim and shoulder profile was noted amongst the Class I sherds and a very large number of pots</page><page sequence="77">? R?ordIin?Lough Gur Excavations. 373 must b? represented on the site. In no case was it found possible to reconstruct a pot of this type?largely due to the fineness and fragility of the ware and the absence of the heavy rims which served to preserve larger portions of vessels belonging to Class la. The usual variety of colour and texture was noted?the colour varying from buff or red to black, the latter frequently containing a great many white calcite grits, although a smooth grit-free black ware also occurred. Some of the buff sherds were very fine and sandy and a number of red sherds had a corky texture resulting from the use of a grass temper. Since so much of the Class I pottery has already been illustrated by drawings, here we give photographs of a selection of rims (PI. XXVII) and shoulders (PI. XXVIII) which help to show something of the texture of the ware. Rim-forms again show much variation, ranging from very simple rounded or flattened rims to rolled and other out-turned profiles. Perhaps the most common variant is a type of outward-turned rim which although rolled on the outside has a flat inward-sloping upper surface (e.g. Nos. 16, 17, 18, i9 showing outside and 21, 22 showing inside) identical in section to No. 15, Fig. 32, from Site D. No. 23 is a rim with a collar similar also to examples from Site D, while No. 24 has a groove immediately below the rim and carries a finger-nail impression. Most of the pots appear to have been carinated and a great variety of shoulder form occurs. A rim-sherd (25) appears from the curvature to belong to a small unshouldered bowl of the type of which reconstructed drawings (Fig. 15) have already been shown. The ware in this case is somewhat coarse and gritty and is buff with a black interior surface. The selection of shoulder fragments illustrated shows examples where the shoulder form ranges from a slight change in direction such as Nos. 1-5 to the very marked type such as Nos. 12-17 produced by setting the upper portion of the pot into the lower. In Nos. 16 and 17 the upper portion has broken off so that the shoulders give the appearance of rim-sherds. A small sherd No. 18 carries an ornament of tiny finger-nail impressions. There are no examples with lugs or perforations. Class la. This class of pottery was well represented on Site C, 1949, but as its characteristics have been very fully dealt with already, only a small selection of sherds is illustrated (PI. XXXI). A fairly large number of pots is represented, and in several cases a great deal of the one vessel was found and reconstruction would have been possible had time permitted. One fine example was reconstructed (PI. XXIX) as well as the pot from the burial (PI. XXX) and they will be dealt with first. The reconstructed pot is the largest which has come from any of the house-sites and is in fact the largest Neolithic pot from any site in Ireland. The diameter of the pot at the inside of the rim is 29 cm. and the depth 23 cm. It is made of fine paste containing many calcite grits?mainly</page><page sequence="78">374 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. black in colour, but reddish in parts just above the shoulder. The elaborate club-rim carries an ornament of bands of short incised stabs, each band going in a different direction so as to give a chevron pattern. As is usual in this class of pottery the shoulder is well-marked and the vessel carries ornament, again of short stabs, for a distance immediately below the shoulder. A most unusual feature are raised ridges of curved outline which occur in two places on the shoulder. Unfortunately, in both cases portion of the pot is missing below them, so it is impossible to tell if they formed complete ovals. These ridges may represent vestigial lugs or may be merely ornamental ; they present some resemblance to occuli patterns on Iberian bowls. The vessel has one perforation a short distance below the rim. The pot which accompanied the burial was practically complete and small portions only, which had disintegrated because of damp and the pressure of the clay, had to be restored in the reconstruction. This vessel is somewhat smaller than the previous one?the diameter at inside of rim is 21 cm. and the height is 22 cm. It is a very fine example of Class la. The paste is reddish-buff in colour, verging to black in places and contains numerous white grits. The rim, which in this case is of T-form, carries an ornament of six incised lines concentric with its edges, the bands between these lines being ornamented with short vertical or diagonal strokes. The decoration is very similar to Fig. 14: 3 from Site C, 1940. The shoulder of the vessel is exceedingly pronounced and carries no ornament except a series of three narrow vertical lugs which occur at four places equidistant on its circumference. In one case where the lug has broken off it is quite clearly to be seen that the lugs were applied to the surface of the pot. Although they have been called lugs these vertical mouldings are obviously merely ornamental, but they have probably derived from an originally functional feature. A somewhat similar lug was noted on a sherd from Site C, 1940 (Fig. 14: 15). The remainder of the Class la rims are mainly varieties of club-rims, though a few examples of T-form occur. No. 1 on the illustration has a similar profile to Fig. 14: 11 (Site C, 1940) and the ornament of incised parallel lines is almost identical. This sherd shows at one of the broken ends the method of manufacture. The clay forming the outer surface had evidently been rolled round an inner core. While this method may have been used in otker cases, it is evident here only because the outer cover has not fully adhered to the core which is of a somewhat coarser clay. No. 3 on the illustration has a very similar ornament, but comes from a very thick pot?the rim profile is like Fig. 14: 12, but is heavier. No. 2 carries an ornament of wavy lines almost exactly like No. 10, Fig. 33, Site D. Sherds No. 5 and 8, while differing in profile, are identical in their decoration, which consists of short parallel transverse lines corresponding to Fig. 33: 7 (Site D). No. 6 is portion of the rim of a</page><page sequence="79">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 375 pot of which a very large number of sherds is available, including much of the rim and the shoulder. The rim is T-shaped and carries an ornament of zig-zag lines, now much worn but similar to No. 6, Fig. 33, from Site D. The shoulder of this vessel?No. 12 on the illustration is very elaborate. Its profile is very pronounced and is accentuated by the addition of a raised moulding which carries ornament of short stab lines separated by a horizontal incised line. Two horizontal lugs, which were probably placed on opposite sides of the circumference, are available from this pot ; they resemble a lug on a sherd from Site D (Fig. 33 : 11). An extremely out-turned rim (7) carries a pattern of concentric bands with short diagonal strokes between them, almost identical with that on the pot from the burial. The profile is close to Fig. 14: 5, but the present example is even more out-turned. Portion of a T-rim (4) has similar ornament: A unique rim, No. 9, rather like Fig. 14: 17 (Site C, 1940) in section, carries an ornament of three concentric grooves on its upper surface, the raised ridges between these having incised parallel lines? eaeh series going in a different direction. The underside of the rim is ornamented with vertical parallel lines and a raised ridge on the body of the pot carries short incised diagonal lines. This sherd was found in a red burnt area under the cobble layer?burnt together with fragments of Class II ware. A rim sherd (No. 10) is similar in section to Fig. 9 : 4 and 6 from Site B. Each arm of the T has a series of transverse parallel lines. Only those shoulders which carry ornament are included in Class la and portions of all examples are illustrated. The first fragment, No. 11, has a sharply marked shoulder carrying a lattice-type ornament rather like Fig. 14: 16 from Site C, 1940. It was found at the same place as rim sherd 7 on the illustration, and as the ware is very similar it may belong to the same pot. No. 13 has a corresponding pattern and on it can be seen the beginning of a slight horizontal lug. A well-marked shoulder No. 14 carries a decoration of parallel horizontal grooves. No. 15 has a similar decoration, but here the shoulder is of simple form?merely a bend in the side of the vessel. It is impossible to say whether the ornament in this case is above or below the shoulder and the sherd may well be upside-down on the illustration. This fragment is included with Class la because of the ornament, but it may in fact come from a Class I vessel. Class II. The greatest amount of pottery (over 2,000 sherds) from the site belonged to Class II. The usual variation in form, texture and colour occurred, but a higher proportion of decorated sherds and a greater range of ornament was present on this site than had been hitherto noted. No vessel was completely reconstructed, although in several cases large portions of the one pot were available. PI. XXXII : a shows a large portion of a pot where an almost complete profile is available. The pot is</page><page sequence="80">376 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. of the usual bucket-shape and would have had a flat base. The majority of the sherds of Class II must have come from pots of this shape, although a few sherds (PI. XXXIII : 3) belong to smaller round-bottomed vessels. No. 3, whose curvature suggests a very shallow bowl, would have been much wider in diameter than the usual small cup. Other sherds from obviously large vessels have a curvature not inconsistent with round bottomed pots, but fragments of flat base and the general straightness of the Class II sherds testify to a greater number of flat-bottomed vessels. Base fragments include some in which the side forms a straight angle with the base, others which are very rounded (PI. XXXIII : 12) and one with a slight splay (PI. XXXIII : 11). On this site also examples of false rims occur, pointing to the 'ring method of manufacture. Rim shapes were in the main simple rounded or flat forms, the most common variant being different types of internal bevel (PI. XXXIII : 2, 4 showing the inside of the rims). An unusual form occurs on No. 1, where the rim is turned over and pressed down to form a collar on the inside. A similar rim is found on No. 3, which comes from a round-bottomed pot. Decoration on the rim is rare on this site, but No. 5 carries an ornament of bird-bone impressions on a slightly club rim, the first time this type of ornament has been noted on Class II ware or indeed on any sherds from Knockadoon. It occurs, however, in the Lough Our neighbourhood amongst the pottery from Caherguillamore.84 A slight groove some distance below the rim may be noted on several sherds, three of which (6, 7, 8) are illustrated, the last sherd being also ornamented with an incised zig-zag pattern above the groove. No. 9 has a flat rim with two parallel grooves below it on the outside. No perforations have been noted on any Class II sherds here. Cordons either pinched-up or applied are of very common occurrence on Class II wares from this site; they are frequently combined with other forms of decoration such as cord and incised motifs (PI. XXXV: 1, PI. XXXIV : 7), Ornament of incised lines is still perhaps the most common type, but as well as the rather haphazard decoration noted on other sites, here we have many examples of more formal patterns in which the v incised ornament is arranged in parallel diagonal lines (PI. XXXIV: 13,14), zig-zags (6) or criss-crossed to form a diamond pattern (7 and 10). The incisions vary from thin scorings to quite deeply-cut grooves. A sherd of dark pottery (15) has a slip of pale buff colour and carries an ornament of thin, closely-spaced, parallel lines, almost identical with sherds from Site C, 1940, except that in this case the lines are diagonal, whereas those from the earlier excavation were horizontal and vertical. Several well-surfaced fragments (16) are decorated with finely incised parallel lines. 8* Referred to below under Site D and in P.R.I.A.t 54 C (1951), 71, footnote 45.</page><page sequence="81">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 377 Cord ornament may be seen on a great many sherds. On a rim fragment (PL XXXV : 1) of a pot of which a great deal is available, there is a line of impressed cord just below and parallel to the rim edge, and between this and a raised cordon are oblique lines of cord impressions at regular intervals. The next sherd (2), also a rim fragment, carries a pattern of pendant triangles. A U-shaped pattern of impressed cord (3) is very similar to Fig. 18 : 11 from Site C, 1940. Another U-pattern occurs on No. 4, but this time is incised. Similar curvilinear ornament is found on other sherds not illustrated. Remaining examples of cord impressions show patterns of parallel horizontal lines (5, 6, 7) sometimes combined with vertical lines (9, 10) or a haphazard arrangement of intersecting lines (11, 12). A type of "maggot*' pattern, perhaps produced by shell impressions, is seen on two sherds (13, 14) immediately below the rim. This ornament has not otherwise occurred on Class II wares, although somewhat similar impressions were noted on two sherds of better quality pottery from the great stone circle at Orange.85 Finger corrugations occur on plain wares (15, 16, 17) or combined with an ornament of simulated cord impressions (18). An unusual sherd (PL XXXIII: 10) has a badly worn ornament of hyphenated lines in a haphazard arrange ment. The ornament is similar to that found on crude Food Vessels, but the shape and general character of the sherd are more appropriate to Class II pottery. Beaker. The amount of Beaker pottery which came from the site was small in proportion to the quantities of other wares found. It is difficult to give any exact number for the sherds of Beaker, since unornamented portions of pots may be confused with Class I sherds, but a conservative estimate of 250 fragments may be given. It is impossible to estimate the number of pots represented, but at least ten different vessels are recognisable. All the sherds can be assigned (from their ornament and curvature) to B Beakers. One pot was reconstructed (PL XXXVI : a). It is an extremely large example of a B Beaker with crudely executed ornaments of zones of hyphenated lines, separated by plain bands. There are three lines of similar ornament inside the rim. The base of the vessel was not obtain able, so that the height (23*5 cm.) of the reconstructed pot is conjectural and it may in fact have been taller. The diameter at rim is 22 em. Sherds from the Orange stone circle have been compared to this vessel and the comparison still holds, although the ornament here is hyphenated not incised as was erroneously stated in the Grange report.86 Similar hyphenated ornament is noted on almost all the Beaker sherds from the site, though the execution varies and the wares carrying this ??

[2 i]</page><page sequence="82">378 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. ornament are sometimes thin and fine and sometimes comparatively thick. Colour is mainly buff (as in the reconstructed pot) or a bright orange red. Horizontal parallel lines of cog-wheel occur on both the inside and outside of several rims (PI. XXXVII: 5, 14, 15). On a few sherds these horizontal lines are combined with chevron or criss-cross patterns in similar technique (11, 12, 13). A group of sherds (1, 2, 3, 4) belong to the same pot and include rim fragments. The decoration here is composed of zones of fine horizontal cogwheel lines, separated by bands which carry short, oblique, parallel, notched impressions, produced by a cogwheel or notched stick. The internally bevelled rim carries on the bevel and just below it on the inside of the pot (seen on No. 2), an ornament of cord or pseudo-cord impressions?perhaps produced by a pointed stick. The lines of impressions below the rim go in different directions, giving a herring-bone pattern. This pattern is similar to that on the edge of a rim from the Grange stone circle. Three other rim fragments of very thin ware (8, 9, 10) have the usual parallel hyphenated lines on their exterior, but inside (10) the rim carry a series of short, oblique, notched impressions above one horizontal line. An unusual fragment (17) is of very fine thin sandy ware, brick-red in colour, and has two- shallow grooves a short distance below the rim. The ware is very similar in quality to the fine pottery noted on Site D. Some sherds of which a selection are illustrated carry ornament of incised parallel horizontal lines. On one sherd (30) these are combined with a diagonal line and on another (31) a chevron pattern is noted. Several base fragments are available which show the usual variation of straight angles and slight outward splay. A large portion of a base of red ware (Fig. 30: 4) carries ornament of finger-nail impressions. The character of the pottery is consistent with Beaker, although it is somewhat thick, and the occurrence of similar finger-nail impressions on a sherd (PI. XXXVII : 24) with a few lines of typical Beaker ornament, probably from the same pot, lends weight to its inclusion in this class. A considerable number of body sherds with finger-nail ornament were found with the base and it is likely that all of these sherds belong to the same pot. One may envisage a rather large Beaker almost as big as the reconstructed vessel, ornamented with hyphenated lines and with a deep band of finger-nail ornament near the base. A sherd of thick though well-finished pottery carries ornament of two deep stab lines (Fig. 30: 1) and is very similar to sherds from Site D. Another fragment of similar ware (2) carries shorter stab lines. A rim fragment of buff ware (3) is ornamented with small stab marks and is exactly similar to sherds from the Grange stone circle.87 *i P.B.I.A., 54 C (1951),* 63 and fig. 8.</page><page sequence="83">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 379 Stone. Spearhead (PL XXXII : b, 1). This is another example of the type of spearhead already exemplified on Site A and fully discussed above. It is made of hard shale, is of pointed oval section and tapers to a point at one end, the very extreme tip of which is broken or worn. It is broken at the broader end. This spearhead, which was found below the stone layer and therefore in a Neolithic??Early Bronze Age context, forms another addition to the southern distribution of the type. Beads (PL XXXII: 6). Portions of ten stone beads were found. Five complete beads (2-6) are small and slightly-domed (a type mentioned also in connection with Site D below). Two larger beads (7, 8) are approximately circular, while fragments of two others are more irregularly shaped. No. 11, roughly oval in shape, is perforated at one end and should perhaps be more properly described as a pendant. Four of the beads Fig. 30.?Site C, 1949: Pottery?Beaker and various (i). came from on or near old ground level, while the others came from various higher levels. The material of the beads has been kindly identified by Mr. J. C. Brindley as follows : Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are made of chlorite ; No. 7 is of shale; Nos. 8 and 9 are of hard shale; No. 10 is made of serpentine; No. 11 is of fine sandstone. Axes and axe chips (PL XXXVIII). Four complete axes were found and about eight large fragments, as well as a considerable number of smaller axe chips. No. 1, the most perfect as well as the largest of the complete axes, is of flat, pointed-oval cross-section with a very sharp cutting edge somewhat worn in places. No. 2 is considerably damaged along all the edges, but seems to have resembled No. 1 in shape and section. A smaller axe (3) of broader oval section splays out towards the sharp cutting edge. It is clearly waisted for hafting. Another small axe (4) resembles an example (Fig. 39: 4) from Site D in its almost rectangular [212]</page><page sequence="84">380 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. cross-section. The asymmetrical long-section of the present example clearly shows that it was hafted for use as an adze. On two of the complete axes (2 and 4) the line of the cutting edge is slightly oblique. Several of the larger fragments 5, 8, 9, 10 are pointed butt-ends of axes. The remaining large fragments are all of broad oval section. The serrated edges of many examples indicate their use as scrapers. The axes and axe chips came from all levels on the site. The material of the axes has been identified by Mr. J. C. Brindley. Of the illustrated examples Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 6 are all of dark shale. No. 5 is of compact sandstone. The other axes and fragments are all of altered felsite. Smaller axe chips which are not illustrated are again mainly of green felsite, though some are of altered shale. Almost all of these axes and axe chips are made from Lower Palaeozoic types altered in character?such as the old felsites, tuffs and grits which are widespread in this formation and are often practically indistinguishable. Hammer-stones. Seventeen hammer-stones came from the site. These again followed the same pattern as that observed on the other sites and it is therefore thought unnecessary to illustrate any of them. Nine of them were approximately spherical (diameters varying from 65 mm. to 100 mm.) with flattened facets from hammering or rubbing and the remainder are longer stones of varying sizes worn at one end from use. One larger stone with a smooth surface due to rubbing may have been the rubber of a saddle-quern. All these objects are of sandstone, mostly coarse-grained. Whetstones. Ten fragments of whetstones were found (not illustrated). They are in the main rather shapeless pieces of sandstone but show smooth surfaces from use and in some cases grooves from sharpening pins. One example is better shaped?of approximately rectangular section and is also of fine-grained sandstone. Flint and Chert (PI. XXXIX). About ninety pieces of flint and twenty pieces of chert came from this site. Many of these were waste fragments and small nodules from which flakes had been removed. Almost all the better shaped artifacts are illustrated; these are mainly of flint, although a few well-shaped pieces are of chert. Six arrowheads or fragments of such were found. Two of these (1, 2) of flint are of the Beaker barbed-and-tanged variety; in each case one of the barbs is broken off. No. 3 of finely flaked white flint is the upper portion of a leaf-shaped arrowhead, while No. 4 of chert is similar. The remaining two fragments, 5 of flint and 6 of chert, seem to be arrowheads broken in the course of manufacture. Fine chipping is also noted on numbers 7 and 8 which may be described as slug-knives. Round scrapers are represented (9-16) by flints of varying degrees of workmanship. In</page><page sequence="85">? R?ord?in?Lough ?ur Excavations. SSI several cases (10, 11, 12) the cortex of the pebble is retained, the working edge only being chipped. The remainder of the illustrated examples show points and blades of flint, some of which are in the Bann flake tradition as noted on Site C, 1940. No. 21 is pointed and may have bee(n used as a perforator. Quartz. Only about twenty-five pieces of quartz crystal were found. These are mainly discarded fragments left over from chipping or nodules from which flakes have been removed. A few pieces are, however, fashioned into points or blades, and since they closely resemble illustrated examples from the other sites, they are not illustrated. Bone (PL XL). Points. By far the largest number of worked bones from the site were in the form of bone points of which a hundred and fifty examples were found. Most of these were made from flat pieces of bone smooth on one side and pointed at one end (1-13); there are about sixty well finished examples of this type. Other thinner, more rounded bones are sometimes highly-polished on all sides to form pins (14-20). In both classes there is considerable variation in size. A very sharp point (21) is formed from the distal end of a sheep tibia. Gorge (24). One small flat bone is pointed at both ends and is perforated nearer to one end in the manner of No. 24 from Site C, 1940. (It was broken subsequent to excavation.) It was probably used as a gorge as has been suggested for the other example. Spatulae(?). The ends of two flat fragments of bone (22 and 23) have been rounded to form spatula-like objects. Beads. Two bone beads, portion of a third and a length of notched bone were found. Both beads are simple barrel-shaped examples, one (25) being rather large, the other small. The broken bead (27) is unusual in being dome-shaped. The piece of notched bone (28) is similar to, but not identical with, that from Site D. It may have been used like the other example for the manufacture of bone beads. The notches here, however, are more unevenly and crudely executed, the perforation is larger and beads from it would be much shallower than those from the Site D segment. It is possible, therefore, that the present object has affinities with the notched bones from Galway and Iberia which have been discussed by Miss Chitty.88 The beads with the exception of No. 26 came from a very low level, as did the notched bone which came from a pit in old ground level. ??

It has the remains of two perforations and may have served as a toggle, such as examples from the barrow at Chinnor, Oxfordshire,89 which however are Iron Age in date. Fish vertebra (30). A small fish vertebra (type of fish unidentifiable) was found on the site. This may have no significance other than as an indication that fish was eaten by the occupants, but it is worthy of note that similar fish vertebrae occur amongst the grave-goods at El Argar and were evidently used as beads.90 Lignite (PI. XL). Four pieces of lignite bracelet were found, all of them above or in the stony layer. The material in every case is dull and shaly, notably different from the jet which will take a high polish, as found on later sites.91 One large fragment (31) comes from a bracelet with a diameter of approximately 8 cm. (externally). Glass. Beads. Five glass beads were found. Three (found at depths of 10, 23 and 55 cm. respectively) are of greenish blue glass (one illustrated, PI. XXXVI : b, 2) and are similar to the small beads discussed under Site C, 1940. Two of the beads are very tiny, but the third is larger? 9 mm. in external diameter. One bead of dark blue glass is related to the well-known type of melon bead. Examples of such beads are common from pre-Roman times until the Viking age. The present example differs from the majority in having a raised collar at either end?in this it resembles one from Ballinderry II Crann?g,92 except that the collar on the Ballinderry bead is made from a two-coloured glass cable. Although this bead occurs at a low level it is in soft dark clay and could easily have been introduced from above. Its stratigraphical position is, therefore, of no chronological value. Another bead made of two cables of pale blue and white glass is paralleled by beads from Lagore93 and other Early Christian sites. It came from a high level in the humus. Bronze (Fig. 31). These were only seven pieces of bronze from the site. Five of these came from a low level, well beneath the sealing layeir of Stones, and the other two (1 and 4) came from amongst the stones in the top layer. 89 Ant. J., 31 (1951), 146 and PI.

The blade now appears to be somewhat asymmetrical rather in the manner of a halberd, but it is greatly corroded at the edges and it is impossible to tell whether the asymmetry is intentional. One side has a raised mid-rib. In its corroded and fragmentary state no reconstructed outline or comparison can be suggested for the blade. Awls. The remains of two awls came from the site. One of these (2) is almost identical with an example from Site C, 1940, having a circular section at one end which changes to a very flat rectangular section at the other end. The flat portion of the present example is well-made and sharp-ended. The other awl (3), which is incomplete, is rectangular in section at one end and rounded at the other. Fig. 31.?Site C, 1949: Bronze objects (\). Openwork fragment (4). A small fragment of very thin bronze is cut into an openwork pattern. It has four circular openings, the projections between which have an ornament of incised circles. The central portion of the fragment, which also has an impressed circle, looks as if a setting had been attached here. It was found at a high level and no profitable attempt can be made to date it. Of the other fragments one is a piece of thin bronze rod 10 mm. in length, of rectangular cross-section?it may be portion of an awl. Another (5) is a thin strip 20 mm. long cut irregularly from the rounded edge of some object, and the last is merely a tiny scrap of shapeless bronze. Iron. All the iron fragments (not illustrated) from the site came from a high level, above the layer of stones. These include some iron slag found in</page><page sequence="88">384 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. the humus, representing iron smelting at a date which cannot be deter mined. The other fragments consist of three iron horse-shoe nails, a horse-shoe, 18th century in date94 and a much-corroded tanged iron knife similar to those found on sites of the Early Christian period. Charcoal. Charcoal fragments from Site C, 1949 have been examined by Dr. P. O'Connor, Keeper, Natural History Division, National Museum, who has identified the following species (the names are given in descending order of frequency) :?HawTthorn (Crataegus), ash (Fraxinus), hazel (Corylus), oak (Quercus), holly (Rex), cherry (Prunus), pine (Pmus). SITE D. This site (PI. XLII : a) occupied a small and narrow valley east of Site C. The valley is bounded along most of its length on the east by vertical rock face; on the west rock outcrops to a lower level and drops down almost vertically to the level of Site C. Before excavation the stones of a hut could be seenj near* the rock outcrop on the western side of the valley ; there was a terracing of large blocks below it (PI. XLII : b), and higher up, where the valley became a narrow neck, there was another terracing formed of smaller stones. Our attention was directed to this site because of the stone-built hut and excavation was, in the first instance, carried out on this, but it became evident that habitation had taken place over the whole floor of the valley in the neighbourhood, and hence the excavation was extended to cover the area from below the lower terrace wall to well above the stone hut, and the area in the neighbourhood of the upper terrace was also investigated (PI. XLI). As a result of this investigation it became obvious that the stone hut and the terrace walls represented the latest phase of activity on the site, and that the earlier occupation was in wooden houses on the clay floor of the valley. The Stone Hut (House I) (PI. XLIII : b). When the turf and humus were stripped from the hut it was Seen to be characterised by a number of large upright stones. The surface under the turf was composed mainly of weathered limestone fragments, but when these were removed a layer of larger stones which formed a roughly cobbled surface became evident. The upright stones had been placed on this layer or?to the south-west?on the bare rock surface and had been 94 Information from Mr. P. Nyhan, National Museum.</page><page sequence="89">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 385 held upright by smaller stones wedged under them and by turf. The latter could be detected in the interstices as a fine powdery deposit. On the western side the rise of the natural rock had been utilised as portion of the wall of the hut (PL XLIII : a). The manner of the completion of the hut-wall was not evident, but a considerable amount of collapsed stone around the larger blocks suggested that the lower portion was largely stone-built, while the upper part may have been of turf. No post-holes were found in the neighbourhood of the wall, but a pit and a post-hole were found near the centre of the hut. The post-hole (diameter 9" and 8" deep) was stone packed and had been built in a pit belonging to an earlier stage. No hearth was found within the hut nor was one discovered at this level outside it. It is, however, likely that the loose limestone would have allowed charcoal to be washed down and traces of burning would not be preserved at this level as we found them to be on the clay surface underneath. The hut measured 17' in length, N-S, and about 10/ in breadth, Ei-W. A gap at the south between the wall-stones and the rock outcrop indicated the position of the entrance; another (smaller) gap in the north-east was probably fortuitous. The Terracing. The terracing to the south of the hut was formed by placing large stones across the valley so as to connect the rock masses at either side. That this was not a primary feature is shown by the fact that the stones were placed on loose rubble which contained bones and pottery sherds, showing that habitation had already been in progresa for some time before the terracing was carried out here. The terracing was earlier than the stone hut; the latter was built on rubble accumulation which banked against the walls of the terrace and which, by reason of the terracing, provided a somewhat level surface which would have served as a yard for the hut. The material banked against the terrace wall was, like that immediately under it, a loose rubble containing habitation refuse. It was doubtless due in part to natural causes?the creep of the disintegrating limestone down the valley?but also in part to the accumulation of debris from houses, built and destroyed. That the soil-creep down the steep slope of the valley was in fact a problem to be dealt with is shown by the second, higher terrace built of smaller stones. Excavation here showed no house above it and the small patch of land which was levelled in this manner would have had little value for agriculture, so that the terrace would apear to have been built to prevent scree from washing down on the habitations. This upper terrace had been built twice. To the south a wall of smaller stones rested in a natural fault of rock; here only a light cover of turf and humus had formed over the rock surface. Higher</page><page sequence="90">386 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. up the hill the wall had been built of larger stones and banked against it was an accumulation of small stones, bones and Class II pottery. To see if this debris could have been derived from a habitation site further up the hill an exploratory trench was dug to the north. No indications of any habitation were found, however, and there was a covering of only a few inches of humus over the rock. It will be noticed on the plan that the lower terrace wall is doubled at the eastern end. In the space between the stones of the double portion ? considerable amount of pottery and bones was found ; a hollow between the stones seems to have been used as a rubbish dump. With the uncovering of the original ground surface, pits, trenches and post-holes were revealed. That these were earlier than the stone hut and terrace walls is shown not only by their not appearing at the upper levels, but also by the fact that some were beneath these later features. For instance, two post-holes were directly under the walls of the stone but, while trenches, hearth and post-holes occurred under the stones of the lower terrace. The Northern Wooden House (House II) (PI. XLIV: a). The post-holes were concentrated in two groups? a northern group (House II) and a southern group (House III). The northern group was mainly east of the stone hut, but was in part underneath it. It is clear that here, as in the houses on Site C, there had been considerable alteration. On the plan a tentative outline is suggested by a dotted line based on the outer post-holes. These give an oval house, diameters about 24' and 20* respectively. This seems to represent the latest phase here because the post-holes, trench and other features towards the centre tended to be covered by the traces of a clay floor. It would, therefore, appear that at its earlier phase the western&gt; side of the house stood in the curved trench. At the east it must have slood in part on the rock surface since some of the post-holes are either in the actual rock or in pockets of clay in it. Burials. Near the north-eastern side of the house were two burials. Burial 1 (PI. XLV : a) was found in a pit (23" deep) in which was dark fill with decayed organic matter, bones, fragments of Class I pottery, greenstone axe chips and flints. The burial, that of a child of four to five years of age,95 was at the bottom of the pit and partly in a cavity of the overhanging rock. The body lay on the right side with the face 6 Information from the report supplied by Dr. R. G.

E?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 387 turned towards the rock, the legs flexed, the arms close to the chest and the hands by the chin. The bones of the lower limbs were much decayed. Burial 2 (PL XLV : b) lay also on the right side in a similar flexed position, the head resting on the rock surface and the line of the burial east and west. The bones were those of a child between five and five and a half years; of age. The burial was in the lowest level of the rubble over original ground level. The Southern Wooden House (House III) (PL XLiy : b). The outline of the southern house was revealed by post-holes, trenches and the line of a stone-setting. These gave a peculiar plan, but it is the only one which fits the excavation evidence?a D-shaped house about 18' in length along the straight, east-west side, and about 18' north-south. The straight side of the D was defined by the stone setting?a line of small stones accompanied by post-holes. It was also marked by a step in the ground surface along the western portion of the line and by a trench at the eastern end. A second step at a higher level suggests a double wall. This trench turned south to form the eastern side of the house where it incorporated large post-holes. On this side it was duplicated by a second trench about three feet further east. Whether this indicated a double wall or a re-building on this side is not certain. A large pit (depth 19") on the western side of the house against the rock outcrop was in the suggested line of the wall, but may not have been in use contemporarily with the house. The position of the hearth was marked by a heavily burned area on the clay surface towards the northern side of the house. Post-holes within the house do not fit into the outline and presumably are due to repair. The sequence of houses on Site D would appear to be (1) House II, (2) House III, (3) House I. It is likely that occupation of the two wooden houses overlapped, but at the stage at which the terrace wall was built across portion of House III it must be argued that not only had this house been destroyed, but also House II must have gone because the debris which was then levelled against the terrace was in part derived from it as well as from natural slip of stony material. When House I was built both wooden structures were gone. Further slip against the terrace would have taken place during and subsequent to the occupation of the stone hut, and would complete the effect of stepping of the ground surface at this point. Above the northern wooden house a short arc of stone wall ran westwards from the rock outcrop and probably formed the base of a small hut or shelter which was partly built against the natural rock. A layer of habitation refuse under this indicated that it was not an early feature. East of it, near the rock face, were two pits containing habitation</page><page sequence="92">388 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. refuse. Near these was a scatter of loose stones; but no indication of formal building. Report on the Burials by Dr. R. G. Inkster. Burial 4. Child's skeleton in fragmentary condition. The child was under six years of age as estimated by the condition of the occipital bone. The permanent teeth had not yet erupted and the milk teeth formed a set in excellent condition and slightly worn with use. Dr. McCaughey's estimate of the age of the child from the teeth is four to five years. Burial 2. Child's skeleton in fragmentary condition. All the epiphyses of the limb bones are ununited and some of the separated epiphyses are present. In one cervical vertebra the neurocentral synchondrosis has united on one side, but appears to have remained separate on the other. Two other neural arches have not united with their centra, a process which takes place between three arid six years. The one-sided fusion in the cervical region suggests that the age is nearer six than three. The second cervical n?uro central junction is still open. The lower jaw is peculiar in that the mental tubercles are very prominent and form tubercles on each side which measure about 1 cm. from side to side, about 5 cm. from above downward and project about *5 cm. Dr. McCaughey's estimate of the age of the child from the teeth is five years or at most five and! a half years. The milk teeth are sound but worn with use and the second dentition not yet erupted. From various parts of the site fragments of human bones were collected with the animal bones, and have been identified as follows: one fragment of human skull vault; one fragment of skull vault which is probably human; seven fragments of skull vault which are human and are unusually thick ; one fragment of human clavicle and ten fragments of human skull including the rostro-superior quarter of a right parietal which is unusually thick (7-10 mm.). Finds. Pokert/. Site D produced over four thousand sherds of pottery. This amount fe less than half of that from Site C, but in view of the fact that the area excavated is much smaller, the quantity is indicative of considerable intensity of occupation.</page><page sequence="93">? Jl?oKD?is-^-Lough Gur Excavations. 389 r&gt; ?l Fio. 32.?Site D : Class I pottery (*).</page><page sequence="94">390 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. The types of pottery represented are similar to those from Site C. There are, however, differences in the relative proportions of the types as well as minor contrasts in the fabric and other features. Some of these will be noted below when dealing with the different classes. A striking feature of Site D is the quantity of Beaker found. In relation to the remainder of the pottery there is a larger proportion of Class I and la and a smaller proportion of Class II than was the case on Site C. The pottery sequence has been studied in the same manner as that of the pottery from Site C and the results have been found to parallel closely those on the latter site. Class I (and la) pottery was found to occur in the lowest levels with only slight admixture of Class II. The latter type became dominant in the higher levels. This succession was best exemplified in the area east and north-east of House I where there was no disturbance due to terrace building or other activity to alter the sequence, but was in general true for the whole site. Beaker was well represented on Site D, and, as will be seen below, appeared in a variety not noted on the other Knockadoon sites, and the number of sherds is comparatively large in proportion to the total amount of pottery. The presence of the Beaker is a useful guide to the relative chronology of the structures on the site and the, pottery gives confirmation of the sequence of building which has been suggested above on the evidence of the structures themselves. The wooden houses (II and III) were associated with the occurrence of the almost pure Class I (and la) pottery from near old ground level. The lower terrace wall was built after Beaker had come into use as sherds of Beaker were found beneath it. Beaker was also plentiful in the fill below the terrace wall and it is clear that this type of pottery was still popular after the building of the wall. As already stated the stone hut (House I) was built* later than, the terrace and the pottery associated with it was mainly Class II. Here we may anticipate the description of the other finds and state? that associated with House I were also the fragments of a stone mould for palstaves and of a clay mould foi1 looped spear-heads. This evidence of a Middle Bronze Age date clearly shows us a sequence from the Neolithic (Class I pottery, a small admixture of Class II, wooden houses) through Beaker times (Beaker sherds, terrace wall and presumably some structure in the intermediate level of which no trace was recovered) to the Middle Bronze Age (Class II pottery and metal working, House I). Class I (Fig. 32). Because a large number of rims and shoulders are illustrated from Site C, a smaller selection is shown from Site D. In general the range of form, colour and texture is similar on the two sites, but the proportion of simple rounded rims, straight or out-turned (1-5) is much smaller on this site. The more elaborate rim-form produced by rolling out the clay, already mentioned on Site C, occurred in great</page><page sequence="95">?

A variant of this is shown on No. 8 where the clay is bent over but not fully rounded. A form notable on this site is produced by rolling over and pressing down the clay to form a deep collar' (10-13, 21). The method of manufacture is demonstrated in Nos. 10 and 21 where the turned down clay has not fully coalesced with the wall of the vessel. In some instances (9) a pinched-out ridge produces an unusual profile. Varying degrees of club-rim form are illustrated including examples with flat, inward-sloping or outward-sloping upper surfaces. One sherd (20) carries ornament of incised parallel lines and may be regarded as intermediate between Class I and the more elaborate forms of Class la. Two fragments of reddish ware, one of which (23) is illustrated, belong to a minature round-bottomed cup, of the type shown in reconstruction in Site C. As on Site C, it appears that most of the vessels were carinated and the variation in shoulder form is similar on both sites. An illustrated example (24) shows the very marked type of shoulder produced by setting the upper portion of the pot into the lower. Lugs are rare but when present they occur on this type of shoulder. Two examples are illustrated on one of which (25) the method of affixing the lug is visible where it has not fully adhered to the shoulder. Considerable variation in texture can be noted within this class of pottery, some sherds being extremely fine and smooth while others are rough and gritty. Quartz and calcite grits are used, the latter being more common in the wares of poorer quality, where the grits appear on the surface. Class la (Fig. 33). All the examples of this class found on Site D are illustrated. The variation shows that each sherd represents a different pot. Club-rims and, in three cases, T-rims are represented. All the ornament is incised, there being no cord, simulated-cord or hyphenated impressions, but there is considerable variety of patterns. The wavy pattern of No. 10 may be noted and the chevron effect obtained by breaking and changing the direction of the transverse lines as in 3, 4, 6 and 8. While it is argued that most of these pots were carinated only one example (1) presents definite evidence of this by showing a complete profile from rim to shoulder. One shoulder sherd (11) carrying a lug ornamented with short oblique impressions is shown. The ware in this case is unusually heavy and coarse; in texture it is similar to Class II ware and is possibly influenced by it. Class II (Fig. 34). Since Class I and decorated wares (Beaker and various) comprise a large proportion of the pottery from Site D, the amount of Class II is relatively less than on- Site C. Almost all the forms already seen are represented, but decorated fragments are rare. One reconstructed vessel is illustrated (PI. XLVI : a), the rim is flat with a</page><page sequence="97">?, BfoSD????-Lough Gur Excavations. 393 25 26 Fig. 34.?Site D: Class II pottery (i). ^EOC. R.I.A., VOU 56, SECT. C. [2K]</page><page sequence="98">394 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. narrow groove on the outside. The height of the vessel is conjectural as a complete profile is not available. The selection of sherds shown gives the range of rim forms which is similar to that already fully discussed in relation to Site C. Perforations are of frequent occurrence. Usually they are approximately horizontal and placed a short distance below the rim (1, 2, 3, 7, 9). A peculiar form of perforation is shown (10) in which the holes run from the top of the rim obliquely downwards to the inside of the pot. One perforated rim (22) has an unusual profile?a flat, slightly-everted top, constriction below, giving an asymmetrical T-shape with the main projection inwards. Some of the rims are decorated by means of stab-marks on the upper surface (14-16). One of these (15) has a series of stab-marks below the rim on the outside. Otherwise, the sparse decoration of Class II pottery on this site consists of horizontal incised lines (23, 24) or of intersecting lines which occur on an exceptionally hard, red, well-baked fragment (26). Finger-corrugation occurs on the outside of No. 25. The base of the reconstructed vessel and a fragment (27) both show an outward splay. Beaker (Figs. 35-37). The number of Beaker sherds from Site D was very large and the variety of ornament, thickness and texture suggests that they were derived from a large number of vessels. The number of vessels here represented is larger than that on any other site at Lough Gur or on any other site hitherto excavated in Ireland. Complete restoration is not possible in any instance and in many cases the size of sherds is too small to allow a decision as to what type of Beaker is represented. However, rim profile and a tendency to continuous horizontal ornament suggests that the majority of fragments belong to B Beakers. The most common type of ornament is a series of horizontal, parallel or somewhat irregular, lines. It is notable that these lines are not of comb or cog-wheel and that in general with the exception of one or two fragments no comb or cog-wheel impressions occur on the Site D Beakers. The ornament is incised by means of a pointed implement. This ornament of horizontal lines is frequenly combined with bands of shorter lines? diagonal or (rarely) vertical (Fig. 36 : 13-20, and PL XLVII : 10, 11). Diagonal lines are arranged to give a chevron pattern on some of the sherds (Fig. 36: 21, 22) and chevron patterns are also produced by means of very light sharp strokes (23, 24). Cord-ornament occurs on both sides of a rim fragment (Fig. 35 : 14). Two other examples of the rare occurrence of cord on Beaker in this locality were noted at Rath Jordan.96 A few specimens occur of another ornament which was also represented at Eathjordan, consisting of pointed oval incisions, between horizontal lines (Fig. 36: 25, 26).

R.I.A., VOL. 56, SECT. C. [2k2]</page><page sequence="100">396 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Ornament on both sides of Beaker rims is common in the Lough Gur neighbourhood and examples illustrated include one with horizontal lines (Fig. 35: 3) and one with an unusual pattern of short sloping stabs (13) as? well as the cord-ornamented fragment already mentioned. Sherds with what may be called ladder-pattern occur (Fig. 35 : 12, and Fig. 36: 29). A false relief effect is produced by a raised band between two chevrons immediately below the rim of No. 7. One sherd has ornament not only on the exterior, but also on the surface of the internally bevelled rim (Fig, 35: 15). What appears to be finger-nail ornament is found on one piece (PI. XLVII : 9). Rim forms are varied but examples of out-turned profiles appropriate to B Beaker are frequent. Some p?ts with undecorated rims (Fig. 35 : 17, 18, 19) are remarkable from the view-point of the quality of the pottery, which is exceptionally thin and well-surfaced and in general quite out of the ordinary in relation to our prehistoric wares. Some of these sherds are illustrated photographically (PI. XLVII : 1, 2, 4) to indicate the quality. The colour may be brick-red, buff, or almost black on the outside while the core is frequently grey. White grits are present but are ground extremely fine so that the surface is either quite smooth or very slightly sandy to the touch and is remarkably uniform. The pottery is hard and was evidently well-fired. The rims are out-turned and, in some instances, have a slight raised ridge near the top on the exterior and a flattened facet on the interior. The ridge varies in character and distance from the rim (Fig. 35: 17 and 19). In most cases these pots appear to have been unornamented, but some sherds of similar ware have portions bearing ornament of horizontal lines (Fig. 36: 4^6 and PI. XLVII : 6). The acceptance of these vessels as Beaker is based on th? fact that in profile, quality of ware and type of base they more closely resemble Beaker than any other type, and, further, they are associated on the site with normal Beaker sherds. No parallels are to be found in the published literature, but Mr. R. B, K. Stevenson, who has seen the material, informs me that among the Beaker sherds from Glenluce Sands in Wigtonshire some have cord ornament while some are undecorated and that the plain examples are in certain cases similar to ours?red surface and smooth feel. Mr. Stevenson kindly sent me for comparison some sherds of Glenluce Beakers. They are, however, heavier than the Site D examples. The Glenluce Beakers (plain and cord) and other Scottish examples (cord) have a moulding or collar below the rim.97 On the Glenluce rims "the majority seem to have the moulding which varies considerably in character and distance below the rim" (letter from Mr. Stevenson); the example published by 97 Childe, in Homenaje a Julio Martinez Santa-Olalla, Actas Y Memorias, Madrid, 21 (1946), 178.</page><page sequence="101">?

Childe,98 however, shows a moulding which is quite different from the slight ridge oh our rims. Apart from these pieces of especially excellent texture the Site D Beaker sherds are in general of good quality. Most of them are hard, thin, well-fired and somewhat sandy. Some, however, are open and corky as from the use of a grass temper (FO. XLVII : 7, 8). This is so similar to the corky type of ware included in Class I as to suggest that Neolithic techniques in pottery making influenced the manufacture of some of the Beaker wares. A considerable number of fragments of base were found, and some of the sherds were large enough to enable the diameter of the base to be determined (Fig. 35: 30, 31). The sections illustrated (29-35) give an indication of the variety of bases on the site. While an outward splayed foot is common there are also examples where the side curves directly into the base. A very unusual vessel is represented by the reconstructed fragment (Fig. 37). In texture, colour and type of ornament it belongs to the Beaker group. Unfortunately only a few sherds are available and it is therefore impossible to complete the profile. The reconstructed portion shows part of the base (diameter about 115 mm.) with sharply outward-sloping walls. To continue this profile as that of a normal British Beaker of AC or B form would suggest a vessel of such immense proportions as to be highly improbable. A shallow bowl (not much higher than the reconstructed portion or a large Continental Bell-Beaker such as that from Wanzleben, Saxony) which is very similar in ornament" are much more likely hypotheses. The ornament consists of concentric bands of ladder pattern, ** Scotland before the Scots, Plate V, 4. ?? Abercromby, Bronze Age Pottery, I, Plate II, 31.

This pottery is heavy, though well-finished and rather Fig. 38.?Site D: Pottery?Food Vessel and various ($). similar to the best-quality Class II pottery ; it is ornamented mainly with incised (though in one case stab) lines arranged in chevron pattern. Several examples have a groove and ridge below the rim (1). There is considerable variation in thickness and some of the thinner fragments have ornament on the inside of the rims as well as on the outside (2, 3). Pottery very similar to these sherds has been found in the same neighbourhood at Caherguillamore, Co. Limerick,100 in association with loo Unpublished; the finds are in private possession. The site was a rock crevice evidently utilized in the manner of a megalithic tomb *nd containing inhumed burials.</page><page sequence="104">400 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. highly decorated Neolithic wares and in this case sufficient fragments were available to allow the reconstruction of a large flat-bottomed vessel. Pottery from another neighbouring site at Rockbarton,101 included a rim similar in profile to some of those under discussion, though differently ornamented. Two fragments of reddish, sandy ware carrying ornament of small stab marks are illustrated (8, 9), but there is nothing to indicate the type of vessel to which they belong. Another fragment (10) of out-turned rim is of hard pottery equal to Class I in quality, but heavier and has two incised lines one of which is interrupted by slight stabs giving it a hyphenated appearance. Two sherds, one of which (11) has a pattern in false relief and the other (12) which is portion of a heavy base bearing simulated-cord ornament, are Food Vessel in type. A rim-fragment (13) with incised lines may also belong to this class of pottery. One flat sherd (14), piece of a base to which a small portion of the wall of the pot is attached, bears an ornament of triangles with parallel lines on the underneath surface. The occurrence of ornament on a base and the type of this ornament proclaim the sherd to be Food Vessel? paralleled by many ornamented Food Vessel bases. Mtoulds and Crucibles. Clay moulds. Ten fragments of clay moulds were found in a group at a high level (depth 7") outside House I and immediately north of it. Six of these fragments fitted together and are illustrated (Fig. 40: 1). They clearly form part of a spear-mould, but because of their fragmentary condition it is not possible to say much with certainty of the type of spear-head cast from this mould. Portion of a groove at the lower end suggests that it was looped and that the loop was placed immediately below the base of the blade or was possibly incorporated in it. The material is a sandy clay baked to a grey colour on the inside where there would have been contact with the metal, but the outer portion of thei clay, which forms a sort of envelope, is red and less hard and has, broken away from the inner layer in places.' The other fragments are of similar material, one being more rough and gritty; two are evidently portions of spear-moulds, the curvature of the inner surfaces being such as would agree with that of a spear-socket. The others are more doubtful of ascription, but may also have been derived from spear-moulds. As well as this group a few other very small pieces were found, but they are too fragmentary to allow one to decide the type of mould from which they were derived. Clay crucibles.

The material was the same type of sandy clay, burnt grey on the surface but with red core, as that from which the moulds were made. The large piece was evidently derived from a crucible of small capacity which thickened considerably towards the base ; the base was much thicker in relation to capacity than is usual in the series well represented from Early Christian sites.102 Stone mould (Fig. 40: 2). Two fragments which join together and form the major portion of one valve of a stone mould for looped palstaves, were associated with House I. One of the fragments was found inside the house, the other outside it to the north-east; both occurred near the top of the stony deposit under the humus. It is worth remarking that all the remains of moulds (of clay and stone) and crucible fragments were associated with House I, the occupants of which evidently engaged in bronze working. The palstave mould is of fine sandstone. The outer curved surface is polished. The space inside the groove for the loop is broken, and a channel which would have produced a tapering ridge on the face of the palstave is also injured on one side. The portion between the channels in which the flanges of the palstave were formed has a series of irregularly parallel grooves scored on the surface. The purpose of these grooves was not obvious at first, but became clear when a wax casting was taken from the mould and the following explanation of the method of using the mould is based on consideration of this casting. In its present form the mould does not give a satisfactory palstave, the flanges being much too low and the septum between the recesses for the halved haft, too thick. Further, in developed palstaves of this type there is usually some undercutting where the ends of the side-recesses terminate in pockets which take the ends of the haft. Such a palstave could not be cast in a mould made completely of stone, because, due to the undercutting, the mould would have to be smashed to remove the metal. The method adopted therefore, was to place clay of the required depth on the grooved surface. The grooves served to prevent the clay from slipping. An identical piece of clay would be placed on the other valve leaving between the two clay portions, sufficient space for the septum. By this means the necessary depth is given to the flanges, the septum is reduced to the required thickness and undercutting at the end of the recesses can be achieved. In the drawing such a clay inset has been indicated; its size corresponds not only to the space available in the stone valve, but also almost exactly to the recess of an actual looped palstave103 of similar type to the one for which this mould was intended. 102 For instance, those from Garranes, P.R.I.A., 47 C (1942), 137. 103 The palstave is in the teaching collection in U.C.D.</page><page sequence="106">402 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy.

Of the large number of finds under this heading only two complete axes occurred. One of these (1) of close-grained dark volcanic ash104 is of flat oval cross-section. It has a remarkably sharp cutting-edge. The long section is slightly asymmetrical, suggesting its having been hafted as an adze. There are Fig. 40.?Site J&gt;: 1?portion of clay spear-mould; 2?portion of stone palstave mould (|). 304 Mr. G. F. Mitchell has kindly identified the materials of the stone objects from this site.</page><page sequence="108">404 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. portions of three other axes of similar material which also have rather flat sections. One of these (5) has the whole of the cutting edge broken away almost at right angles perhaps because of its use as a wedge. The complete example (1) was found almost on old ground level and the others are also from deep levels prior to or associated with the lower terrace wall. The second complete axe (2) is of a medium-grained igneous rock (perhaps Ailsa Craig) and the section is a broad oval. The other fragments from the site indicate that this was the more popular type of axe. A feature of this axe, observed also on others from Lough Gur, is that the upper part of its surface is pecked while the lower portion is smooth. The butt is of a blunt and truncated form. In this example the pecking is not uniform over the whole of the upper surface ; portions of both faces are pecked, the sides have been treated more vigorously and there is a faint mark indicating the edge of the haft. The pecking over the upper portion of the axe served to give it a better grip in the wooden haft. Axes treated in this manner have been noted in the Ronaldsway Culture in the Isle of Man,105 and in publishing these Mr. Bruce and Mrs. Megaw have brought to notice parallels from Northern England and Scotland. To these areas Ireland and France must be added. The feature has already been noted on many axes from the barony of Small County, in Co. Limerick,106 and Professor O'Kelly has drawn my attention to an example from Antrim in Cork Museum. Undoubtedly a search through Museum collections would reveal many more. The same pecking treatment is to be noted on axes and adzes from the famous Camp de Chassy site107 so the occurrence of this feature would appear to be much more widespread than appeared at first. Two badly damaged small stone axes (PL XLIX: a) deserve particular mention because they are of porcellanite of Tievebulliagh or Rathlin origin. The material identified in the first instance by Mr. Mitchell has since been petrologically examined by Mrs. Morey of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, and these examples are being included in a paper by Mr. E. M. Jope on the Tievebulliagh-Rathlin axe factories which is to appear in ?.J.A.107* One fragment (Fig. 39: 3) from the middle portion of an axe of igneous rock somewhat similar to the material of No. 2, deserves remark because 10? J. R. Bruce and E. M. Megaw in P.P.S., 13 (1947), 147. In the examples figured in this paper the pecking tends to be uniform over the upper portion of the axe and ends along a straight line, as it does also in some of the Irish specimens we have noted, and on the Camp de Chassy axes. The Irish and French examples appear to have been polished first and then pecked, contrary to the procedure described by Mr. Bruce and Mrs. Megaw. i*?6 N.M.A.J., 4 (1943), 236, 240; 5 (1944), 33, 35, 37, 50.

While the length of the complete axe cannot be determined, the cross-section (maximum dimensions 80 mm. by 49 mm.) shows that the axe was unusually large?the largest for which we have evidence on the excavated sites at Lough Gur.108 The number of smaller axe fragments and chips from stone axes from Site D is very large?a total of over seventy. The chips vary in size; the bulb of percussion on many indicates deliberate chipping of the axes to produce these flakes, and the serrated edges indicate their subsequent use as scrapers. The majority of the smaller axes and axe fragments are of a fine-grained stone, light green in colour, for which here and throughout this report the term "greenstone" is used. The material is usual not only on the Knockadoon sites, but also on other sites in the Lough Gur neighbourhood. A typical greenstone fragment from Site D was sent to? Dr. J. F. S. Stone who kindly arranged for its petrological examination by Dr. F. S. Wallis and Mr. E. D. Evens.109 This item is listed in the Third Report of the Sub-Committee of the South-Western Group of Museums and Art Galleries.110 Its description agrees with the characteristics of the Great Langdale Group (Group VI) and a piece of Great Langdale material sent to me by Dr. Stone looks superficially similar to the Lough Gur specimens (the Great Langdale material has a slight blue tinge not seen in the Lough Gur greenstone). However, Dr. Wallis's microscopic examination has definitely shown that the Lough Gur specimen is not of Great Langdale stone and subsequent examination of two other slides of Lough Gur axes (from Site C, 1949 : PI. XXXVIII : 11 and 17) showed these to be similar to the first example (one slightly more coarse-grained) and not of Great Langdale origin. The place of origin pf the Lough Gur greenstone is, therefore, unknown ; one can only say of it that the makers of the axes succeeded in obtaining a material similar to one which was popular in Britain. As already mentioned the axes of flat section came from deep levels and as the axes and fragments of oval section came from all levels down to old ground level it is clear that both types were in use contemporaneously even during an early stage of the occupation.

Two others (PL XLVIII : 8, 9) are tapering portions of long stones showing abrasion due to hammering at the narrow end. The remaining three are pebbles (two broken) which show signs of having been used as hammer-stones and, to some extent, as rubbers. Rubbing stones (PL XLVIII). Two pieces of sandstone have hollowed surfaces produced by rubbing or grinding on them. One (3) has three concave faces while the other (4) has an oval depression on one face. The long smoothed surfaces of the former suggests its use for the polishing of stone axes; the latter may have been similarly used, but may have served as the lower stone of a saddle quern. Whetstones. The number of whetstone fragments found is small? a total of six, of which two pieces fit together and are part of a coarse grained sandstone disc (20 mm. thick), slightly concave on the upper surface and convex on the lower. Another is a tabular piece of close grained sandstone (110 by 70 by 20 mm.) very worn on the upper surface. There is a small fragment of a Similar whetstone, and there is a piece, of rectangular cross-section, of fine-grained sandstone (35 by 22 mm.) regularly formed and very smooth from use. Saw (?) (PL XLVIII: 11). Another object was at first thought to be a whetstone. It is a flat piece of micaceous slate (86 by 78 by 10 mm.) one face of which is smooth, but not as regularly smooth as the normal surface of a whetstone. The other face is broken away irregularly. Two edges are bevelled?sufficient remains of the broken face to show that one edge had a double bevel. This feature makes the object similar to the Neolithic stone saws which have been brought to notice in Switzerland. They have been excavated at Petrushugel (Commune of Cazis, Canton of Cyrisons) and are exhibited in Chur museum. A similar object of greenish slate, two of the edges of which have a double bevel, came from a small ring-barrow at Cahercorney, not very far from Lough Gur. The site was dated to the Neolithic period by a sherd of Windmill Hill type ware.111 The Cahercorney saw is; illustrated here (PL XLVIII : 10) for comparison with the Site D object. These stone saws are intended for cutting stone with the aid of sand which is used to abrade the grooves, and their effective use has been demonstrated by the excavator of the Petrushugel, Dr. W. Burkart.112 Quern ( ?). One piece of sandstone which seems to be portion of the edge of a rotary quern was found. It came from above the upper terrace m MacDermott, J.C.H.A.S., 54 (1949), 101-2.

There is a large number (a total of thirty) of stone beads from Site D and a considerable variety of types is represented. Of the smaller beads (upper half of illustration) most are circular, slightly domed, with perforations which are broader beneath and which narrow to a very small opening on top. (This type has been noted on Site C, 1949, above). Others (7, 10, 12) are more irregular, and there are fragments of very light ring beads (16, 17). The larger beads (lower half of illustration) show greater variety of shape and in some cases are irregularly made. Sharp hour-glass perforations are shown on some (23, 26, 30), while others (28, 29) were bored in the same manner, but the hole has been subsequently smoothed. The large bead of rectangular outline (29) has two notches on the long side; notches appear on two of the smaller beads also (19, 21) as well as on No. 25 which has an exceptionally large perforation. On one of these (19) the notches are sharp nicks, slightly worn; on the other beads they are smoothed apparently by the rubbing of a string.113 The beads were found at all levels but the majority occurred at deep levels and these deep finds included some of the smallest type of beads and also some of the largest (28-30). The material of the stone beads from Site D has been kindly identified by Mr. G. F. Mitchell as follows : Numbers 1-5, 12, 19, 25, 27 are of a serpentine containing a metallic oxide. Nos. 6-11, 20, 21, 23, 29 are of chlorite schist. Nos. 13-17, 22, 24, 28, 30 are of grey-blue slate and No. 18 of a brownish slate. No. 26 is of fluorspar and is the only bead of this material found on any of the Lough Gur sites ; this material could occur in the local limestone. For the possible provenance of the other materials here identified, see the report on the stone beads from Site ?, 1940, above. Flint and Chert (Fig. 41). About one hundred and ninety fragments of flint (including many waste pieces and tiny chips) were found on Site D. Most of it came from pebbles and small pieces, again indicating, as remarked on Site C, an unsatisfactory supply. The amount of chert was also small, about eighty pieces, but here again it may be noted that the chert seems to have been of better quality than the available flint as there are six finely finished arrowheads of this material and only three of flint. A 113 a group of stone beads found in 1951 on Circle L (Windle) have more pronounced notches which in some instances give an outline suggesting their derivation from the anthropomorphic forms of stone plaques from Iberia (cf. Leisner, Die Megalithgr?ber der Iberischen Halbinsel, Berlin, 1943, Taf. 146 and 147.)</page><page sequence="112">408 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. representative series which includes almost all the well-fashioned artifacts is illustrated; numbers 1-8 are of flint and the remainder are of chert. One flint, Beaker-type, barbed-and-tanged arrowhead (1) was found. The other arrowheads (2, 3 and 10-15) are all leaf-shaped and include slender examples (2, 10 and 11) as well as the rather broad type (3, and 12-15) noted on Site C. A chert flake No. 9 is shaped like a leaf-shaped arrowhead and is finely chipped, but only on one side, the other being the plain flake surface. Well-fashioned round scrapers are also represented on Site D. Some are made (as No. 4) by steeply chipping one end of a small pebble to give a rounded outline and others by chipping the edges of a circular or semi-circular flake (17). The remainder of the artifacts illustrated, are points or blades of various shapes. A triangular flake of chert (18) has been steeply chipped on two sides; two other flakes (8) of flint and (20) of chert are pointed to serve as perforators. Quartz. About one hundred and twenty fragments of quartz crystal came from Site D. This number includes waste pieces as well as flakes and points showing definite signs of working. A selection of the more finely fashioned examples are illustrated (PL XLIX : b). A triangular point (1) is shaped like a tanged arrowhead. A blade (2) retains part of the natural surface of the crystal to form one of its sides?a feature already noted on Site B. Another well-fashioned point (4) has a similar feature. No. 8 shows a six-sided crystal from two sides of which flakes have been removed, illustrating the method of manufacture of blades and points. Bone and Antler (Fig. 42). Beads. The site produced eleven bone beads (of which six are illustrated) and a segment of notched bone from which beads were being cut. The notched bone (5) is instructive as it clearly shows the method of manufacture. The notches were made by ringing the bone with vertical incisions and then removing the material by oblique cuts. The bone could then be broken into short segments, these being subsequently smoothed to form beads. The jagged ends of the piece of bone indicate that already at least two beads had been cut from it, and some of the beads found (6, 7) show unsmoothed cuts which indicate that they have been produced by this method. One exceptionally long bead (4) is different in type and another (3) is unusually large. The beads came from various levels, but it is clear that they were being made at an early stage of the occupation as several came from old ground level or near it, and the segmented bone was found in a pit in old ground level near the south-western corner of the excavated area.</page><page sequence="113">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 409 Points. Twenty-one bone points were found. As the range of variation of these is similar to that noted in the Site C material illustration of Site D specimens or further discussion is not necessary. Perforated disc' (8). This disc perforated obliquely at the centre and very regularly made, is too light to be a spindle-whorl so its purpose is uncertain. It was found just under the humus near the upper terrace wall and may be later than the occupation of the site. Antler implement. This object (9) is portion of the base of an antler, which includes part of the main stem and two tines. The main stem has been cut across and there are near the end two short incomplete cuts. Fig. 41.?Site D : Flint and chert (?). One of the tines near it also shows signs of having being cut with a sharp instrument. The hole was pierced from both sides, one side being oval, the other more regularly circular. The purpose of this object is not certain but similar perforated antlers have been found in Swiss Lake dwellings and are regarded as agricultural implements.114 114 One from Lattrigen figured by Ischer, Die Pfahlbauten des Bielersees (Biel, 1928), Abb. 17. 4, is described as a hoe. Also in Zurich Museum, in an exhibition of reconstructed models of implements, a hafted example is shown in the section devoted to agriculture. PR0C. R.I.A., VOL. 56, SECT. C. [2l]</page><page sequence="114">410 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Lignite. Portion of an unusually light lignite bracelet (Fig. 43: 13) having a circular cross-section, was found near the upper terrace wall. Glass. Beads. Three beads, four portions of beads and a small irregular fragment of sheet glass were found (none illustrated). This last is almost certainly modern ; one of the beads (Find No. 53), of bright blue and of very small size (diameter 2 mm.) is also probably modern. Of the other beads, one (Find No. 350) is small (diameter 6 mm.) and greenish-blue in colour and is similar to the small beads discussed at length under Site C, 1940. It was found at a depth of 9" near the south-eastern corner of the excavated area. The two fragments (Find Fig, 42.?Site D : Bone and antler objects (?). No. 268) which apparently belong to a single bead are also greenish-blue in colour; they are thin and the perforation is comparatively large. They were found at a depth of 10", under a large stone, north-east of the stone hut. A larger bead (Find No. 39) is of a darker green colour and the surface is corroded. It was found immediately under the turf just south of the lower terrace wall. A fragment of very thin green glass (Find No. 518) is probably portion of a bead. It has two irregular impressed lines on the surface. It was found just under the humus of the upper terrace wall. From the same area and also from under the humus came a bead fragment (Find No. 475) of darker green glass. Gold. One piece of gold (PI. XLVI : b, 31) was found on this site. It is a small (diameter 11 mm.), very thin disc of sheet gold, perforated with two holes. The holes are roughly punched and the outline of the disc is</page><page sequence="115">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 411 irregular. Since the metal is so thin (about the same thickness as medium quality writing paper)115 the object is much too light to have been handled unless strengthened by a backing of some other material, to which it was presumably stitched through the two holes. Some of the gold " sun discs " are similarly perforated with two holes,116 but these discs are all much larger than the Site D object. Gold discs with perforations occur in Wessex117 but are also larger than ours. Small unperforated examples occur which are approximately the same size as ours;118 they were found with an incense cup, faience beads, an amber necklace and other objects. In 1806 a human skeleton was found in a cave at Carrig-a-Crump near Castlemartyr, Co. Cork, and is described as having been covered with exceedingly thin plates of gold. The information available is unsatisfactory, but the account119 includes mention of a " round bit of gold" weighing 6 grains. Another object from the find is figured by Armstrong120 and is a plate with chevron ornament?which would agree with an Early Bronze Age date for the find. The Site D disc was found among the stones which supported the uprights of the lower terrace wall. When found it was bent double along a line across the perforations. Bronze (Fig. 43). The amount of bronze from Site D is not large and, with the exception of a few shapeless fragments, is all illustrated. Awls. Three awls (1, 2, 3), double-ended, square or irregularly rectangular in cross-section are similar to those from Site C. The smallest example (1) was found about ?ve inches above old ground level and evidently associated with an early stage in the occupation of the site. The other two came from a high level south-east of House I. Two pieces of bronze rod, one of which (4) is illustrated, may have been intended as material for the fashioning of awls. Pin. One nail-headed pin (5) with slightly cupped top, similar to those dealt with from Site C, was found at a high level (7" deep :?stony material) in House I. A small piece (6), which appears to be of copper, may be portion of a pin of a different type. The cross-section is a flat rectangle and the somewhat expanded head is flattened obliquely on top. Fragment of axe. A piece of the cutting edge of an axe (8) was found about 2" over old ground level on the upper side of the lower terrace wall?near the find-spot of the small awl (1) mentioned above. 115 The weight is -073 gram. ? 1*12 grains. 116 Armstrong, Catalogue of Irish Gold Ornaments, PI.

A second piece (7), found below the terrace wall and also near old ground level, is still smaller and, therefore, less definite, but its narrow taper suggests that it may be portion of the cutting edge of a chisel. Knife. A knife blade (9), found at a high level at the lower side of the terrace wall, has edges serrated by wear and corrosion. Its present length is 75 cm. It thickens gradually to a mid-rib on both sides. Bracelet. A bracelet (10), oval in outline (internal diameters 62 mm. and 30 mm.) was found in the material of the lower terrace wall.

A tiny perforated piece of sheet bronze (12) was found in the humus at a depth of 4". A piece of sheet bronze (or brass) bent into a circular form (11) is roughly perforated, the holes being punched through?one from one side, the others from the other side. It was found over the rock surface at a depth of 8" near the south-eastern extremity of the excavated area. The find circumstances and the character of these objects suggest that they are much more recent than the occupation of the site. Iron. Of the iron objects found (a total of fifteen pieces, none illustrated), ten were nails (horse-shoe nails and square-headed nails) ; four were unidentifiable fragments of iron and one was an iron knife, possibly of seventeenth- or eighteenth-century form. The knife was found at a depth of 6", one nail was found in loose stony material at a depth of 12". All the other iron finds were at depths of 4" to 6". Animal Bones. The site produced nine sacks of bones and the general remarks made in relation to Site C bones are applicable here also. Ox accounts for most of the bones while pig and sheep together make up about f&gt;%. Other animals represented are: horse?teeth only; dog (or wolf)?shaft of fibula, toe bones, teeth and coprolites (the bones represent a very large animal) ; fox? one tooth ; rabbit??a few bones, presumably recent ; bird?a few bones, species not identified. Charcoal. Dr. P. O'Connor, National Museum, has identified the following varieties of charcoal from Site D (in descending order of frequency) :? Hazel (Corylus), ash (Fraxinus), holly (Ilex), whitebeam (Sorbus), hawthorn (Crataegus), cherry (Prunus). SITE E. Above the path connecting the Black Castle and Bouchier's Castle the eastern slope of Knockadoon is steep and rocky, but in several places narrow but comparatively level spaces occur as a result of the stepped rock formation. On one of these rock shelves, which was about eight yards broad and thirty feet above the path-way between the castles, three hut sites were noted. Two others stood on the next shelf ten feet higher up the hill. The structures, rather overgrown and not clearly defined, were indicated by rough stones enclosing rectangular spaces, one side being formed by a natural rock face. Site E (Fig. 44) is one of the three structures on the lower platform. Its longer axis lay at right angles to the general contour of the hill? this was the more usual but not the universal disposition of these huts. The western side of the hut was formed by the rock face and its outline was shown by large blocks of stone (PI. XLV : c)?mainly thick tabular</page><page sequence="118">414 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. pieces placed on edge, but in some cases fallen from their original position. The structure was about 16' long and 12' broad. Excavation was difficult because of two trees which grew immediately outside the hut in the north, and the roots of which crossed the whole site. The roots were particularly troublesome towards the north-western corner of the site, hence this portion was left unexcavated. Under the humus a hard surface of gravelly clay appeared?at a depth of about 6 inches on the outside of the hut and at a depth of 12 inches inside it. A few post-holes were found in this surface and a Fio. 44.?Site E: Plan.</page><page sequence="119">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 415 small burnt area which may have been the hearth. Otherwise little of structural interest was revealed. The large wall-stones were supported at the level of the gravelly floor inside the hut?in part directly upon this layer, in part on a propping of smaller stones. Charcoal flecks were found plentifully everywhere on the site and evidently resulted from the burning of the building. The building must have been mainly of wood and other organic material. The stones which marked the position of the walls would have served as a foundation course only. There were no signs of intensive occupation and it seems likely that this hut, placed on the inhospitable eastern side of Knockadoon, was only used as a temporary shelter for a brief period. Finds.121 A chert leaf-shaped arrowhead and a piece of flint were found imbedded in the floor. Immediately above the floor were a fragment of pottery (the only one found), a bone point, and a whetstone. The sherd was a piece of a small red cup such as we have noted on several other sites. A fragment of iron, probably a nail, was found among the tree roots in the western half of the hut. The arrowhead appears to have been in primary association with the structure. The sherd and bone point could be contemporary with this type of arrowhead and may also belong to the occupation. So little material came from the site, however, that a dogmatic statement on the date of occupation is not warranted; it can only be said that the finds indicate the probability of a Neolithic date. SITE F. This site is near the western end of Knockadoon at the upper edge of a slope which falls towards the lake-shore about eighty yards distant. The site is at the foot of a bare rock face about 6' in height, above which the ground again rises gradually towards the centre of Knockadoon (PL LI: a). Before excavation the house showed *as an approximately rectangular outline defined by a bank from which stones protruded in places. The internal dimensions of the house were 27' by 21', the long axis running N-S. The eastern side of the house was defined by the rock-face which clearly served as one of its walls. Excavation (PL L) showed the outline of the house to be more irregular than was apparent from surface indications. The north and south walls curved slightly inwards near the rock-face, this curve being much more 121 Finds from this site and from Site G (also meagre) are not illustrated. The pottery from sites E, F and G is not illustrated; it is described in relation to the pottery types already well exemplified in the illustrations.</page><page sequence="120">416 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. pronounced in the southern wall. The walls were everywhere of poor construction. The underlying rock had a very irregular surface (PI. LI : b) and no attempt had been made by the wall builders to level this or to place the wall-stones firmly on the rock. Almost everywhere under the wall there was a layer, 4" to 6" in thickness, of rubble and bones. The method of building consisted essentially of piling stones together and only occasionally did these appear to be placed in such a way as to suggest any attempt at a facing. Natural bosses of rock were utilised a? part of the wall when these were in suitable positions. In places there was a layer of compact yellow clay over the bed-rock, but clay had not been utilised as packing between the stones and the only material which remained in the spaces between them was rubble and humus. Because of the irregular surface of the limestone it was sometimes difficult to distinguish between artificially constructed post-holes and natural holes which may or may not have been utilised to take uprights. On the plan, only those of which we felt reasonably definite have been marked and these are mainly near the wall or set in it. A large hole (21" square, 10" deep) at the middle of the line of rock-face was probably deliberately cut, at least in part, and would have served to carry a large post, a companion for which would have stood in the similar but slightly smaller (12" square, 6" deep) hole which was north-east of the middle of the west wall. The number of post-holes found is insufficient for the posts that would be required to carry a structure of this size and others were presumably set directly on the rock or in natural crevices in its surface. The poor quality construction of the walls made it unlikely that these could have been built to a sufficient height and it is likely that they served as footings only, more perishable material being used to complete the walls?in the manner suggested for other sites (A, D?House I, E). As there was no trace of a wall construction on the eastern side of the house, the roof on this side must have rested on the rock shelf. Within the house the rock was covered in some parts by a layer of humus only; in other parts, where the rock surface dipped (especially towards the western wall) a layer of rubble lay between the humus and the rock surface. The rubble consisted of small pieces of limestone, bleached and levelled so that the surface resembled a deliberately laid pavement, though the resemblance may have been due to nothing more than the trampling of the rubble during the occupation of the house. Hearths were found at two places within the house and at one under the wall. At the centre of the house a hearth was marked by a spread of charcoal. A second hearth occurred south of the hollow in the north eastern quadrant, and was marked by a spread of charcoal and a setting of small stones to level the surface. In the same quadrant a hearth at the edge of the wall ran under it for a distance of 18", and like the</page><page sequence="121">? B?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 417 layer of humus and bones, gave evidence of an earlier occupation of the site. The entrance to the house was at the northern end of the west wall, where there was a gap about 8' wide between the end of this wall and the northern wall of the house. On the southern side of this gap was a post-hole in the wall. Fig. 45.?Sites F and G: General plan, showing excavated areas. From the western end of the north wall of the house a field-bank ran down the slope towards the lake (Fig. 45). Parallel to this and about 200/ north of it was a second field bank, the two enclosing a field the boundaries of which were completed by the rock outcrop on the east and by the lake, when the water stood at a high level as before the nineteenth century drainage, on the west. Sections were cut out on both field banks. The section on the northern bank yielded no finds. It revealed that the bank was carefully stone faced on both sides, three courses of stone remaining on the northern</page><page sequence="122">418 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. side, two on the south. The bank remained to a height of about 2' and was 4' wide. On the northern side a ditch over 3' wide and 2' deep ran immediately alongside the bank, and presumably provided material for packing between the stone facings. The southern field bank was somewhat similar in character, but was not as well constructed nor as well preserved as the northern one. The stone facings were ill-defined and only appeared in places. A ditch ran immediately beside the bank on its southern side ; this was about 2f deep, the shape varying?in places round-bottomed, elsewhere flat. The gravelly sub-soil from the ditch had been used to form the body of the bank, which stood to a height varying from less than 1' to about 2'. The junction between the field-bank and the extension of the north wall of the house was carefully investigated by crossnsections and a longitudinal section. It was found that the stony wall changed gradually to the earthen gravelly bank, this change approximately coinciding with the junction between rock and clay in the sub-soil. On the evidence of structure it was not possible to decide on the chronological relationship between wall and bank, though for other reasons it will be suggested that the field-bank is a late feature, and it is likely that the stony portion between the house and earthen bank was constructed at a place where the occurrence of rock prevented the digging of a ditch. Under the bank and near its eastern end was a hearth set in a hollow in the clay about 2' in diameter and'5" deep and in this several fragments of clay moulds and some bronze waste from casting were found. This hollow had been dug as near to the house as the occurrence of the gravel would allow?the limestone between this point and the house would have prevented its being placed any nearer. This fact is of interest for its possible bearing on the relation of house and bronze working and on the date of the former. Further cuttings were made on the field-bank and in each of these fragments of clay moulds were found. These fragments were found at all stratigraphical positions in relation to the bank?some at old ground level under it, some in the bank material and some in the silting of the trench. It was clear that the moulds pre-dated the bank which was built over some of them ; during the building others became incorporated in the bank, and of these some subsequently slipped into the trench. With the moulds fragments of Class II pottery were found. The problem of the date of house and bank must now be considered. Two things are definite?the house is later than the main occupation of the area on which it stands because the habitation layer runs under the walls; secondly the field-bank is later than the metal-working evidenced by the clay moulds. While the junction of house wall and field-bank did not give clear evidence of their relative age, the use of stone to form the intermediate portion suggests that the house wall material was robbed in the building of the bank.</page><page sequence="123">? R?ordain?Lough Gur Excavations. 419 Three objects of iron came from the western end of the northern wall and could well have been introduced by disturbance at the time of the construction of the field bank. A bone comb fragment found inside the western wall could have been introduced at the same time. One of the iron objects is a formless fragment, the others are respectively a knife with curved blade and a pin or stylus, both of which could be Early Christian or Mediaeval in date. The iron fragment was found in the wall, the other two objects came from the collapsed material. An argument that the wall is not as late as Early Christian times may be based on the character of the building. The walls of Early Christian structures excavated in the Lough Gur area122 were all better built? with double facings of stone and rubble fill?while this wall was made by piling stones together very roughly. The proximity of the hearth which contained the clay moulds to the house suggests the contem poraneity of house and metal-working. The absence of mould fragments from within the house is easily explained by the fact that the work would have been carried on in the open in full daylight, while the house would have served as a shelter for the workers. The sequence suggested for Site F is : (a) a habitation layer of a house earlier than that represented by the stone walls and possibly supported by posts only and dated by the pottery to Neolithic and Beaker times, (b) the stone-walled house used by metal-workers who were responsible for clay moulds of Middle Bronze Age types and for Class II pottery found with the moulds, and (c) field fences, Early Christian or Mediaeval,123 one of which was built as a continuation of the north wall of the house and in it stones robbed from the house-wall were used, while iron objects were discarded in the disturbed wall. The possible alternative sequence is: (a) as before; (6) the house walls of Early Christian or Mediaeval date; and (c) field fences, also Early Christian or Medieval, but later than (b). In this case the house walls would be regarded as those of a badly-built shelter of late date and there would remain nothing which could be regarded as the dwelling or shelter of the bronze workers. On the whole the first of these alternative sequences seems preferable. (In discussing this sequence the description of the finds, which follows, has been anticipated.) i22Carraig Aille and "The Spectacles", P.R.I.A.. 52 (1949). 39?111. 123 A dating in Mediaeval rather than Early Christian times for the building of the field fences is favoured by the fact that they terminate well above the present lake level, the lake at its former level having served as the western field boundary. Indications elsewhere ("The Spectacles", P.R.I.A., 52 (1949), 61) favour a late date for the high lake level?which was evidently due to the blocking of the outlet, not to climatic changes</page><page sequence="124">420 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Finds. Pottery. The amount of pottery found was not large '(about 520 sherds) and much of it consisted of extremely small fragments. There were, however, sufficient pieces with features to enable the types represented to be recognised. It is notable that while the moulds were scattered down the hill-side and were found in each of the cuttings made on the field fence, the pottery was found at or near the house only. Since, as has been stated, the house was built over an early habitation layer and since the depth of deposit was not great and in this stony material stratification was. not reliable, it is not possible to say definitely which pieces pr?e-date the building of the house-walls. The types represented are Class I?several rims and shoulders, Class II?a number of fragments including rims (one perforated) and Beaker. The last type is attested by one sherd which is definitely Beaker?a small piece of dark red ware with two bands of narrow hurdle pattern. As well as this piece there are several fragments of very hard red ware with incised straight lines; these are related to Beaker in ware and ornament. The fragment of hurdle-patterned Beaker occurred at a high level inside the house?over the pavement-like stones referred to above. The greatest concentration of pottery was associated with the hearth on rock surface in the north-west of the centre of the house. This consisted of about twenty sherds, of which a few were of Class I, the remainder of Class II. The amount of pottery from outside the house was very meagre and most of it came from the cuttings on the bank near the house and was evidently a scatter from the habitation at the house site. The types represented were the same as those noted from the house. A few fragments eame from the other cuttings?towards the western end of the field bank?mainly Class I, but none of these pieces has any significance for the dating of the bank. The only association noted was, as already mentioned, a tendency for Class II pottery to occur with the moulds. Moulds (Fig. 46). The total number of fragments of clay moulds found is about 100, but of these many are small pieces, and in a number of instances (even where the pieces are larger) it is impossible to identify the objects cast from the moulds. The material of the moulds is a sandy clay, and the baking has turned this to a very dark grey, but the outer surface is buff in colour and in many cases the inner side is also buff. The buff colour of the inside is obviously due to lass complete baking because it occurs on sherds with less darkly fired body. The buff</page><page sequence="125">? R?ord?in?-Lough Gur Excavations. 421 16 17 Fig. 46.-?Site F: Clay moulds (|).</page><page sequence="126">422 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. colour on the outside, general on all the fragments, is accounted for only in part by the lack of high temperature on the surface; it is also due to the fact that the outer layer is separately applied as a covering envelope of clay, 3-4 mm. in thickness. This has broken away unevenly in places and reveals the surface of the mould proper beneath. The hatching of the cross-section indicates this feature on some of the moulds. On some it was not recognisable either because it had become altogether detached or because it had completely fused with the bulk of the mould. The fragments indicate that the casting was done by means of two-valve moulds ; presumably when these were put together the outside was coated with a covering envelope of clay which would have sealed the joint between them. In the case of the small fragments of moulds no useful conjecture can be made as to the type of object cast in them. In the larger pieces and where sufficient portion of distinctive form is preserved their purpose is recognisable with fair certainty. In the main, two types of weapon appear to be represented?spear-heads and rapiers.124 That looped spearheads were being cast is shown clearly by No. 1 (Nos. 2 and 3 are indefinite, as the apparent loops are at the edge of the fragments and are damaged and reliance cannot be placed on them). Nos. 4, 5 and 6 are pieces from the parts of the mould for the socket. No. 7 comes from the point of a spear mould, while No. 8 is from the blade of a spear of the type in which the portion of the socket which enters the blade has a square cross-section.125 Provision for casting a narrow, flat mid-rib such as occurs on many rapiers is found on three mould fragments?Nos. 9, 10 and 11. This last piece is from the curved portion of a rapier near the hilt. No. 12 would have cast the hilt of a rapier with open notches for the rivets.126 A few examples figured (13, 14, 15, 16, 18) are doubtful of purpose? but would agree with spear or rapier moulds. No. 17 would have cast the square end of a flat object?possibly the end of a square-ended knife tang. As well as the fragments illustrated there are also about eighty pieces which are small or are so featureless that they could not be profitably discussed nor usefully illustrated. 124 In deciding on the types of bronzes cast actual specimens were compared with the moulds. Thanks for help with the material in the National Museum are due to Mr. P. J. Hartnett, who also assisted on the excavation of Site F and who, in the first instance, recognised the mould fragments as such. *25 To be noted in Greenwell and Brewis's Class IV A?" Rapier Type ", Arch., 61 (1909), Plate LXXVI. 126 As Evans, Bronze Implements, Fig. 317. The parallel-sided hilt is unusual, it occurs in the Evans example (from near Deny) and would have been produced by our mould.</page><page sequence="127">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 423 Stone (Fig. 47). Axes and axe chips.. Two large pieces of stone axes were found (1 and 2) and also six chips from polished stone axes. Axe pendant. An object of considerable interest is the perforated stone axe pendant (3). The lower end is finished in an axe edge, the upper is flat. The boring, which is near the upper end, is hour-glass in form. An axe pendant which has features similar to this one was found in Mrs. Hawkes's excavation of a megalithic tomb ("entrance grave") at Harristown, Co. Waterford.127 The Harristown specimen is about the same length as the one from Site F (which is 63 mm. long), but is narrower; it also has an hour-glass perforation near the upper end. Mrs. Hawkes, in discussing the find,128 indicates parallels in Neolithic and Chalcolithic contexts in Western Europe and the Mediterranean and notes no other example of this type of amulet in Ireland. Beads. One bead (4) has a large perforation (diameter of bead 14 mm., diameter of perforation 7 mm.) which is somewhat hour-glass in form. The other (5) is a flat disc, 31 mm. in diameter, also with hour-glass perforation, and might be thought to be a spindle-whorl, but is smaller than these usually are, and the perforation is also rather small for a spindle. Its find place, the hearth at the centre of the house, suggests that it belongs to the early material and it is therefore more likely to have been used as a bead. Whetstones and quern (?). Three pieces of flat stones evidently used as whetstones were found. These could have belonged to any period of activity on the site. A small piece of stone which we thought (doubt fully) to be a fragment of a rotary quern was found on top of the wall of the house immediately under the humus. Flint, chert and quartz (Fig. 47). Chert (28 pieces) was much more plentiful than flint (11 pieces) on Site F, but the better-shaped pieces are all of flint. Of those illustrated only one (6) is of chert. The leaf-shaped arrowhead (7) was found on the edge of the hearth near the centre of the house. The blades (8 and 9) are similar to examples on other Knockadoon sites?having something of the Bann flake tradition in their form. A few chips of chert and flint were found in the cuttings of the field bank but none was of definite form. Five pieces of quartz were found (not illustrated) in the house; they are not well-shaped but two could have served as points. mj.R.S.A.1., 71 (1941), 130-147, 128 ibid., 144.</page><page sequence="128">424 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy.

One bone "gouge" with perforation (10) was found near the Surface of the house-wall at the north-west corner of the house. The other bone points (six in number) were found at various depths? some on the rock surface at the hearth near the centre of the house. The end of a bone point (14) which retained portion of a groove and which had been cut from a large bone was found under the field bank. The surface was remarkably smooth and it appears likely that it was used in connexion with bronze casting, possibly in the mixing of the clay and sand for the moulds or in the shaping of these. Comb fragment (13). A piece of double-sided bone comb was found in the rubble inside the western house wall, north of the middle of the wall. Bronze. A piece of bronze 52 mm. long and of U-shaped section, 4 mm. across, appeared to be a corner binding for some object; it was found in the upper level of the field bank. A flat piece of bronze (20 mm. long, 10 mm. wide?with broken rivet-hole at one end), purpose indeterminate, was found in the wall collapse at the north-western corner of the house. The only other pieces of bronze were found with moulds?one in the hearth immediately west of the house and one further west in the field bank. These were waste pieces from bronze casting. Iron (Fig. 47). An iron knife (16) found in the wall at the north-west has already been mentioned. Near it were found an iron fragment and the iron pin figured (15), the former in the wall, the latter in the collapse. The point of another iron knife came from the rock surface in the north-west quadrant. Other iron objects found (links of draught chains) appeared to be quite modern. Bones. The bones found on the site were very fragmentary and consisted mainly of ox, with some pig and sheep. Other animals represented were horse (teeth), bird (two bones), and red deer (a few bones and fragment of antler). Among the bones were found a fragment of human femur and a piece of human skull.

This site (Fig. 48), to the north of Site F, was similarly placed against an upright rock-face which formed the eastern wall of the structure. It was also similar to Site F in the construction of the wall, which was made by piling large and small stones together with no regularity. The wall was irregularly semi-circular in outline (PI. LII : a), the diameter (along the rock-face) being about 11' inside the wall, while the internal east-west measurement was about 8'. The enclosed space was, therefore, small and the structure was probably a hut, roughly constructed and occupied as a shelter for a brief period. The cliff which formed the eastern wall of the hut rose almost vertically at first to a height of 1' and then above a shelf to a further 5'. At the foot of the rock face the rock was lightly covered (usual depth 5" to 7") with humus and some stone?broken fragments from the rock surface or scree fallen from above. To the west, where the rock dipped, the depth of humus and stones was greater, and between it and the rock surface was a layer of clay and gravel, the upper surface of which, within the hut, had the appearance of having been trampled and evidently repre sented the floor of the hut during occupation. In the eastern portion the floor must have been the bare rock surface. The ends of the wall did not reach the rock face at either side. This may have been due to the fact that the wall-ends were not preserved because of the slip of stones on the rock surface. The entrance was at the north and consisted of a 3' wide gap between two large stones. The stone at the western side of the entrance had a flat base and pointed top. The base was propped on small stones to bring it level. The stone on the eastern side was a large block, one straight side of which lay along the line of the entrance. Of the post-holes found, five had been cut in the rock?to depths varying between 4?" and 9". The shallowest was the rectangular one at the middle of the rock-face. Above this on the face of the rock was a rough vertical niche which may have been in part artificially cut and which would have served to hold the post here in position. A post-hole inside the wall on the west was sunk 6" in the clay and gravel layer and contained stone packing on its eastern side. A hole outside the wall on the west (5" deep in clay and gravel) is only doubtfully to be regarded as a post-hole. In the wall, which was between 1|' and 2' high, the larger stones were sometimes, as in the case of the large one at the western side of the entrance, placed on or close to the hard clay and gravel layer. Else where, rubble, clay and humus were built up to form the base of the wall and on this the larger stones were placed. Pockets of loose humus in the interstices of the stones of the wall may be natural</page><page sequence="131">s o w ? I i ?I S? tel INS WALL ROCK 1 CLAY AND ^**"~ .

Bones and charcoal were found in the wall; these were obviously introduced with the building material, but there was no continuous habitation layer under the wall such as would suggest an earlier occupation of the site (as on Site F). As already stated the remains on Site G suggest a hut roughly built to provide a shelter. The walls could not have been continued to any great height, but, as on other sites dealt with, provided footings for the walls of a structure supported by wooden posts. Finds. Pottery. The total amount of pottery (which came from inside and outside the house) was not large. There were less than twenty sherds of any consider able size as well as many small fragments. All the pottery was of Knockadoon Class II type. It varied within the normal variation of that class of pottery, but tended to be markedly gritty. Colour was black or red and the grits were of black or white stone. Some rim fragments had internally bevelled rims with perforations immediately below the bevel. Other objects. A few flints, one piece of a bone point, two very small pieces of bronze strip and two (modern) iron objects comprised the other finds. Bones. The animal bones found were very fragmentary and were mainly of ox with some pig and sheep. From the lower portion of the material of the wall came portion of an upper human jaw (of an adult of between twenty and thirty years of age) with five teeth in position and also a single tooth. Mr. D. O'Sullivan, Cork, kindly reported on these as follows :? Superior Maxilla?Left side (Human). The specimen shows that the individual suffered from chronic Periodontitis with rarifying Osteitis. Note thickened edges of the Alveolar Process indicating individual's resistance to the disease. Occlusal surfaces of the teeth (comprising in specimen 1st and 2nd Premolars and the three Molars) show marked attrition and abrasion?the cusp tubercles being worn almost flat and dentine partially exposed. The occluso-buccal surface of the first' Premolar, the mesio-buccal surface of the second Premolar, and the buccal surface of the first Molar show slight cavities due to chipping of the enamel. These defects would, however, appear to be due to external agency?not to Caries. The individual Premolar found does not appear to belong to the same skull. The colour difference is pronounced.</page><page sequence="133">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 429 SITE H. Site H (Fig. 49) was situated on the southern slope of Knockadoon to the west of Site A where the ground levelled out. The hill sloped gradually upwards to the north of the site. Before excavation the tops of some stones showed and seemed to indicate the north wall and short portions of the east and west walls of a small hut. No stones appeared at the south. The excavation proved rather unsatisfactory due to the jumbled mass of walls, paving and fallen stone, which are common features in the upper levels of the Knockadoon sites and amongst which it is frequently impossible to distinguish satisfactory house plans. In the case of Site H the evidence was particularly confusing. In the north-east quadrant on removal of the turf a mass of stones was revealed. It was impossible to determine the Une of the wall in this quadrant and the suggestion given on the plan is only tentative. The wall of the hut was recognisable on the west and north-west and a portion remained in the south-east quadrant. Various post-holes were revealed, two of these (in the north-west quadrant) were associated with this latest structure; others underlay wall-stones and clearly belonged to the early phase. A section of paving was noted outside and under the wall-stones at the north-west. Some pottery of Class II type came from above this paving and amongst the paving stones. A few sherds of Beaker also came from a high level. These sections of wall and paving rested on an accumulation of clay containing pottery, bones and other signs of habitation?denoting the earliest period of occupation on the site. At this first stage habitation took place on a fairly level surface, provided in part by the exposed rock and in part by the hard trampled yellow clay. A hearth containing much charcoal and burnt material was found in a natural hollow in the rock and also belongs to this first phase. As already stated most of the post holes must have held posts to support a building at this period and walls of stone may also have existed, but would have been destroyed by subsequent building. Other post-holes which appear in the plan could not definitely be assigned to any particular period and no final house plan was forthcoming. A considerable amount of pottery?mainly heavy dark Class II, but also some ware of Class I type?was found on the rock surface and was obviously related to the first phase in the habitation. A fragment of human skull129 was found at this level with pottery in the north-west quadrant. Owing to labour scarcity and to other difficulties which prevailed at the time of the excavation it was impracticable to uncover a larger area 129 part 0f the right parietal bone of an adult.</page><page sequence="134">?* I Ci Ou S* !?

In view of the small area excavated all that can be stated about Site H is that here we have signs of habitation beginning at a stage when Class I pottery was already rare and when Class II was abundant, associated with timber buildings, and continuing at least until the introduction of Beaker. The final occupation of the site?that associated with the upper stone walls? was probably not later than Beaker times, since the only later objects found on the site were three fragments of iron which came from a high level in the humus and are obviously intrusive. Finds. Pottery (Fig. 50). The types of pottery represented on Site H include a small quantity of Class I, a very considerable amount of Class II, some few sherds of Beaker and several not closely classifiable fragments. The absence of any sherds of Class la and the poor quality of the Class I wares, together with the fact that the great bulk of the pottery is Class II in type, puts the beginning of the occupation of this site rather late in the Knockadoon series. Class I. About one hundred and twenty sherds may be included in this class. On the whole the pottery is of poor quality, obviously influenced by contemporary Class II wares and it lacks the smooth finish and fine paste characteristic of Class I on the other sites. A very few more finely finished sherds occur, however, and in these the corky texture already stressed can be noted. A selection of rim profiles (1-10) is illustrated showing a small variety of forms. A very significant feature is the total absence of carinated pots, not one shouldered fragment being present. In this connexion it is relevant to refer again to the suggestion advanced in the report on the Grange Stone Circle?that in the later series of Class I pottery the shouldered form disappears.130 The absence of shoulders on this late group of sherds is further confirmation of the theory. One rim sherd (10) carries ornament of incised lines similar to that which is common on Class II, but the thinness of the fragment advocates its inclusion in the Class I group. Class II. By far the greatest amount of the pottery on Site H (about eight hundred sherds) belonged to this class. There was no very great variety in the pottery and ornament was exceedingly rare. A selection of rim profiles is illustrated (11-22) to show the variety of forms which includes flat or rounded rims, various degrees of internal bevel (including a particularly steep bevel, No. 18) and some examples with outward- and inward-turned projections. In several cases a large quantity of pottery is available from a single vessel, but reconstruction was not undertaken. 130 p,R.I.A.t 54 C (1951), 55.</page><page sequence="136">432 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. *!!

K?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 433 Rim-sherd No. 18 comes from a pot, of which some t.wo hundred and twenty sherds were obtained. It is a large straight-sided pot with a flat base?the ware is dark with a great many grits of white calcite and the interior and exterior surfaces are buff-coloured. Two sherds (almost certainly from the one pot, although they differ slightly in profile) are perforated a little below the rim (14, 15). Perhaps ten sherds in all of this class of pottery carry ornament. This is of the usual type of incised lines criss-crossed or arranged haphazardly. Sherd No. 23 illustrates the type. No examples of cordons or cord ornament occur on Site H. A number of base fragments were found, of which a selection is illustrated (24-27). Beaker and Various. Three pieces of Beaker pottery came from the site. No. 28, a fragment with incised hurdle-pattern, came from amongst the collapsed stones at a high level outside the house-wall in the south east quadrant. No. 30, with a design of cogwheel, and No. 29, a rim sherd of smooth red ware, probably Beaker, came from immediately under the paving in the north-west quadrant. Two rim-sherds (31, 32) of smooth buff ware carry ornament of dots and finely incised lines on the exterior surface and of incised lines on the internally bevelled rim. As only a very small portion of the vessel is available, it is difficult to say with certainty what type of pottery is represented. The ornament and general character of the ware is, how ever, appropriate to a "pygmy cup" and we are inclined to accept the sherds as from this type of vessel. A small rim fragment of fairly thin dark ware with a burnished surface (33) carries ornament of cord. It was found in association with Class II wares at a low level on the site. Cord ornament is also found immediately below the rim of a heavier sherd (34) which carries two diagonal grooved lines on the surface of the flat rim. It is light buff in colour and does not readily fit in with any definite class. A sherd of fairly coarse pottery has a smooth outer surface and is ornamented with two parallel horizontal grooves (35). This may be related to sherds from the Grange Stone Circle, which have been compared to the type of pottery known as "Grooved ware".131 Bronze (Fig. 50). Only one object (1) of bronze came from the site. This is a length of bronze wire approximately circular in section. It narrows to a point at either end where it is bent downwards. Ornament of short incised lines in groups of three appears at six places on the somewhat flattened face of the wire. No suggestion of the purpose of the object'can be given. It was found at a high level in soft loose earth near the northern edge 131 P.R.I.A.t 54 C (1951), 62 and fig. 8.</page><page sequence="138">434 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. of the excavation; it is not definitely associated with the occupation of the site. Iron. Three iron objects were found (not illustrated). These comprise a greatly corroded length of an iron bar, a small shapeless piece of iron and a length of iron wire with the remains of a loop at one end. All three fragments came from a high level in the humus. Flint and chert. A small amount of flint and chert was found?the total number of fragments being forty of flint and eighteen of chert. Almost all of these were waste flakes and chips, a notable feature being the number of tiny chips present. Only three of the flints are worthy of illustration (Fig. 50) and none of the chert flakes. No. 2 is a small leaf-shaped arrowhead, rather crudely made, which was found with fragments of Class II pottery. No. 3 is a small blade showing secondary chipping and No. 4 is a very crude attempt at a round scraper. Quartz. Fourteen fragments of quartz crystal were found (not illustrated). These include waste fragments as well as a few finely-finished points, and some larger crystals showing facets from which flakes ?have been removed. Bone. Points. Two very crudely finished bone points were found in the stony clay with Class II pottery. They are similar to points noted from the other sites and are not illustrated. Bead (Fig. 50: 5). A small cylindrical bone bead was found amongst the wall stones in the north-west quadrant. It is badly damaged, both surfaces being exceedingly rough and chipped. No other objects of bone were found. Glass. A fragment of a small blue glass bead (not illustrated) was found at a depth of 14" in the north-east quadrant. It is similar in shape and colour (a dark greenish blue) to the beads discussed above under Site C. Stone. Axe chip. One chip of a polished greenstone axe was found in the habitation layer with flint and Class II pottery.</page><page sequence="139">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 435 Stone polisher (?). Portion of a pebble of fchaly red sandstone was flattened and smoothly burnished at one edge as if it had been used as a polisher?perhaps for pottery. Hones. A rectangular piece of red sandstone is smooth on all sides and may have been used as a hone. Another broken fragment has one smooth surface and was probably similarly used. Clay. A small cylindrical bead of baked clay was found (Fig. 50: 6). The perforation was incomplete. SITE I. During the summer of 1945 two sites, I and J, were excavated in the valley which runs north-south across Knockadoon. This valley has in it numerous evidences of ancient occupation and activity. The southern, steeper portion of the valley is narrower than is the more level portion to the north. Across this narrower portion there is a series of lynchets or cultivation terraces, marked by banks of clay and stones, giving a somewhat stepped effect to the ground surface. Similar banks occur at the north end of the valley?at the margin of the more level area and mark off small fields between the rock knolls. There, also, against the rock faces, are slightly raised platforms, delimited by large stones placed in kerb fashion. These platforms may be garden plots, but are small for this purpose and may mark the position of houses associated with the fields; none has been excavated. Starting just above the early lake edge to the south there runs up the valley a ditch with a bank to the east of it. This runs to the east of the modern stone wall which goes through the valley and about half way between the wall and the eastern flank of the valley. The two habitation sites were investigated to try to obtain evidence of their relation to the terracing and to the ditch and bank. Site J, which has already been published,132 proved to be an early-modern (17th century) house; it happened to have been built near one of the terraces and, also fortuitously, there was immediately under the floor of the house a pit and a hearth both dated by the Neolithic pottery which was found in considerable quantity associated with them. The primary purpose of the excavation of Site I was to investigate a small hut placed against the fourth terrace. Other areas were dug to discover the relationship of this terrace with the ditch and bank, to reveal the construction of the third terrace and to investigate the area between the terraces. West of the modern stone wall a cutting was made on the MJ.R.S.A.I., 67 (1947), 39-52.</page><page sequence="140">436 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. line of the fourth terrace and another on a north-south bank near the western side of the valley (PI. LIII). The Site I hut (PI. LII : b) was a small and poorly-built structure and the terrace alongside which it was built was only moderately well defined. Excavation revealed the hut to be very irregularly rectangular, 3 m. by 2*5 m. The walls were composed of large blocks of limestone together with smaller stones and humus. The only feature which evidenced some care in wall-building was the provision of a shallow foundation trench dug in the yellow clay. The trench was found filled with humus and some medium-sized stones, this material rising to a height of about 30 cm., and on this foundation were placed the large limestone blocks which were in part visible before excavation. The trench was not completely continuous, but appeared to have been usual as a foundation where large stones were used. The wall was roughly built; there was no appearance of any attempt to face it and it can be no more than a footing on which a turf wall was built. Four irregularly placed post-holes discovered in the interior of the hut do not give enough data to permit of suggestions as to the manner of roofing. A gap in the wall at the south-west corner indicates the probable position of the entrance. Near the southern wall of the hut were a hearth and rubbish pit, placed close together as in the houses on Site C. The hearth was contained in a shallow hollow about 65 cm. in diameter and 12 cm. deep. The pit, to the east of the hearth, was somewhat smaller (60 cm. by 45 cm.) and was 30 cm. deep. It contained a fill of dark burnt material, with much charcoal, pottery (Class I) and bone fragments. . Some pottery (also Class I) was found in the hearth. The southern portion of the hut floor, in which were the hearth and pit, dipped because of a natural depression in the surface of the yellow clay. Over this depression was found a layer of gravel which terminated against the southern wall of the hut. This gravel appears to have been due to a natural deposit which formed in the hollow in the floor surface after the hut had been abandoned. Above this layer an iron plough share was found near the centre of the hut. The sections across hut and terrace showed that the hut wall had been built alongside the terrace and not bonded into it. Between them was a narrow space which was filled with dark compact humus and small stones. The terrace was built in a manner similar to the hut wall. It consisted of large blocks of limestone set on edge, in places combined with smaller stones and clay. In the interstices of the stones lafcge quantities of bone and a good deal of pottery were found. The eastern end of the fourth terrace curved down the side of the valley to meet the up-curving eastern end of the third terrace; the provision of a connecting bank appears to indicate that the terraces were</page><page sequence="141">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 437 not due to an attempt to level the surface or to dispose of stone, but were in some cases at least part of a system of field enclosing. To investigate the area between the two terraces a north-south strip (Cutting 22) between them was excavated. No pottery was found in this cutting ; the only finds which it produced were an axe chip, a silver coin and a blue glass bead. Sections cut on the. third terrace, however, produced from its immediate vicinity numerous sherds of Class I and Class II pottery as well as other finds. Post-holes and trenches were also found, though they did not give any formal plan and, in part at least, preceded the terrace. Slight surface indications showed the line of the extension of the fourth terrace to the western side of the valley beyond the ditch and bank and to the far side of the modern stone wall. Sections cut on this extension gave scarcely any evidence of the structure of the terrace. Immediately west of the ditch and bank concentrations of stones were associated with much evidence of habitation?charcoal, animal bones, pottery and a stone bead. The stones may mark the site of a house of which a plan could not be recovered, but they may be merely the remains of the terrace?interrupted and levelled in the construction of the ditch and bank. In the course of excavating further west an extended burial was found at a depth of 40 cm. (PI. LII : c). Since the grave had not been sunk in the clay its outline could not be detected. There were no grave-goods, but in the loose soil immediately under the skeleton several fragments of Class II pottery were found. Near the feet of the skeleton a circular hole was found?apparently a post-hole dug 20 cm. deep into the yellow clay. The fill contained much bone and charcoal. The skeleton lay on its right side, extended east-west, the face turned to the south. The left fore-arm crossed the body just above the pelvis and the left femur crossed over the right. The remains were not well preserved and Professor Keenan has kindly reported that they are those of a young person of about sixteen years, and about 4 feet 10 inches in height. The teeth (which were all present) showed a very unusual amount of wear (almost to the level of the gums) for the age of the individual. The sex was not determinable. It is not possible to date this burial with certainty, but it is unlikely that it is contemporary with the later periods (mediaeval or early modern) of which there is evidence of activity in the valley, and the occurrence of Class II pottery near it and in the post-hole at its foot suggests that it is early. As parallels may be cited the large number of extended burials from the double-kerbed enclosure a short distance to the south-east.133 The excavation of the north-south ditch and bank revealed that the ditch was round-bottomed, 50 cm. wide, and cut in the yellow clay to a Excavation report not yet published. The site is J of Windle's enumeration.</page><page sequence="142">438 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. depth of 40 cm. The material from it had been thrown up to form a^ bank (now 50 cm. high above yellow clay). Stones were used in the bank and the presence of many stones in the fill of the ditch suggests that the bank had a stone revetment which collapsed into the ditch. It was quite clear that this bank and ditch were later than the terrace since in places the stones of the terrace were found to have been covered over by the stones and clay of the bank. Furthermore a rim fragment of glazed pottery (of the late 16th or 17th century) was found at a low level in the fill of the ditch and thus the construction of the ditch and bank cannot be much earlier than this date. The purpose of the bank and ditch is not certain; it possibly formed a division across Knockadoon, as does the modern stone wall, or it may have served as a sunken track cattleway leading from the southern shore of Knockadoon to the north where it can be traced to the top of the steep slope bordering the lake edge.131 Finds. Pottery (Fig. 51). A small quantity of pottery?a little over three hundred sherds? came from Site I. Of this by far the greatest amount?270 sherds? belongs to Class I, there are 30 sherds of Class II, one Beaker fragment and two sherds of Food Vessel. Three fragments of glazed Mediaeval pottery were also found. The largest amount (145 sherds) came from the neighbourhood of the hut. All of these fragments and also all the pottery (18 sherds) from the upper terrace belong to Class I; no later wares came from this neighbourhood. The pottery from the cuttings in the neighbourhood of the lower terrace was also mainly Class I, though a fragment of Class II rim and two small sherds of Food Vessel also occurred. The bulk of the Class II pottery came from the excavated areas west of the north-south ditch and bank, between them and the modern wall. One Beaker fragment was found in this area. The remainder of the pottery, Class I and a few sherds of Class II, came-from Cuttings 15 and 16. Class I. The Class I pottery (with which are included a few sherds more properly designated as Class la) shows most of the usual variety in form, colour and texture. On the whole the pottery is of good quality and many sherds of fine hard ware occur. There is a notable predominance of buff pottery with a corky texture and an absence of the black ware with white grits noted on other sites. Some few reddish fragments containing white grits do occur. A selection of rim profiles is illustrated; they conform to the usual 134 For such a trackway and for references see P.R.I.A., 53 C (1950), 270-271. The more usual form had a bank on either side of the ditch.</page><page sequence="143">? E?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 439 types, the most common being variants on an outward-turned profile. Only two sherds (Nos. 8 and 9) show the rolled-over form so frequent on Site H. Two rims belong to the more elaborate la variety. No. 15 shows a very out-turned T-rim which carries an ornament of incised parallel lines arranged in bands. No. 16 shows an example from a pot of which several rim fragments are available. The rim in this case projects inwards and carries an ornament of very fine incised parallel lines, A reddish sherd with simple rounded rim (No. 14) seems from the curvature to belong to a minature cup, of the type illustrated from Sites C and D. Fig. 51.?Site I: Pottery (i). A number of fragments of shoulder came from Site I. These are all of the simple form where the shoulder is merely a change of direction in the pot profile or is pressed-out in the clay. One fragment (No. 17) is unusual in having two lines of simulated cord impression above and below the carination. Class II. The small amount of pottery of this type, and its close similarity to Class II wares from other sites, make it unnecessary to deal with it lengthily here. Most of the Site I sherds have a black gritty body with a smoother buff-coloured exterior. They are in the maiu</page><page sequence="144">440 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. featureless, but three rim fragments occur. No. 23 has a simple flat rim, No. 24 a heavy rim with inward projection and No. 25, which has an internal bevel, is ornamented on the outside with two grooved lines. Other wares. One very small fragment (26) has very fine texture and ornament that is Beaker-like. The section of this sherd shows a pronounced narrowing in a very short length, making it difficult to assign the sherd to any particular place on the pot. A small rim-sherd (27) of Food Vessel carries an ornament of parallel diagonal lines on the rim surface and on the exterior of the pot; it is somewhat thinner than is usual for this class of pottery. Another tiny fragment, from which the interior has shaled off, has similar ornament and is probably also Food Vessel. Mediaeval pottery (not illustrated). Two of the fragments of Mediaeval pottery came from unstratified positions on the site. One of these is of hard ware with yellow glaze and criss-cross ornament, and is identical with fragment No. 8 described and illustrated from Site J,135 dated by Mr. Hunt to the seventeenth century. The other is a thin sliver from the surface of a yellow-glazed vessel; it may belong to the same pot though the colour is somewhat paler. The third Mediaeval fragment was found near the bottom of the north-south ditch. It is a massive out-turned rim of reddish buff ware with a dark green mottled glaze on the inner part of the rim, and is identical with fragment No. 1 from Site J, dated to the late sixteenth century. It is probable that these three sherds are all related to the early modern house, Site J, and that the ditch was in use or at any rate still open during the occupation of that site. Stone. Axe chips. Two fairly large fragments of stone axe are of hard ferriferous shale. (Identifications by Mr. J. C. Brindley.) One of these is the pointed butt of an axe. The other is a large portion of the body of an axe, from which both edge and butt have been broken off; the surface is exceedingly chipped as if flakes had been intentionally removed. Eight small axe chips also occurred, they are all of greenstone. Beads (Fig. 52). Two complete stone beads and portion of a third were found. The illustrations (10, 11, 12) show that these all belong to types already described from other sites. They are all of chlorite. Hones. One complete and very well-shaped hone was found; it is of fine-grained sandstone and is exceedingly smooth-surfaced and of square cross-section. Two other broken fragments of coarser sandstone show smooth surfaces which suggest that they were similarly used. Hammer-stones. An oval-shaped pebble of coarse sandstone, 13 cm. by 10 cm., is flattened and abraded at one end as if from use as a hammer. 135 fa, cfa9 p. 48 and PI. Xm.</page><page sequence="145">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 441 An approximately circular pebble (greatest diameter 85 cm.) of fine red sandstone, has one flattened face, as if it had been used for rubbing, and numerous abrasions which suggest its use also as a hammer. Flint and chert (Fig. 52). A very small amount of flint and chert was found on Site I?nine fragments of flint and thirteen of chert. The majority of the flints are undistinguished flakes or chips, and one fragment only (8) is illustrated. This is a blade which has been made into a scraper by steep secondary chipping along two of its edges. Three of the chert fragments are illustrated. No. 5 shows portion of a leaf-shaped arrowhead, of which the point and part of the butt are broken. No. 6 is also part of an arrowhead and No. 7 is a well-shaped chert point of triangular cross section. The remaining chert fragments include some crudely-worked points and scrapers. c^m? #&gt; ? i 2 3 Fig. 52.?Site I: Miscellaneous finds (\) PROC. R.I.A., VOL. 56, SECT. C. [2 N]</page><page sequence="146">442 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Quartz. Ten fragments of quartz crystal were found. These include a few finely finished points as well as waste fragments. One exceptionally well-fashioned example (Fig. 53: 9) is illustrated; in outline it resembles a minature Bann flake. Glass. One opaque glass bead (Fig. 52: 4), greenish blue in colour, maximum external diameter 9 mm., was found in Cutting 22 near the bottom of the humus. Its date is uncertain. Silver. A silver coin (PI. XLIX : c) came from the humus (depth 15 cm.) in Cutting 22. It has been identified by Dr. W. O'Sullivan of the National Museum as an Irish halfpenny of Edward IV (1470-1478), sixth issue. The inscription is?obv. : crown bust EDV ... ; rev. : long cross with three pellets in each angle . . . ITAS DVB . . . Bronze (Fig. 52). Seven fragments of bronze were found. Two of these are flat thin fragments which may be portion of a knife-blade, but they are too much damaged to be certain. Two other small shapeless fragments are of exceptionally thin sheet bronze and a tiny piece (3) is curved in tubular fashion. A short length of bronze wire (1), roughly coiled in a spiral manner, is of flat rectangular section. The only other bronze object is a small circular disc of paper-thin bronze (2); it is perforated and on one side is ornamented with two stamped concentric circles. Close examination reveals that the ornamented side of the disc had been tinned. All of the bronze objects with the exception of the last-mentioned came from high levels in the humus in Cutting 22 and in the neighbour hood of the southern terrace. The disc, however, was found among the wall-stones at the south of the hut in Cutting 4 at a depth of 40 cm. The presence of tinning is consistent with an Early Christian date and suggests that the object was fortuitously introduced into the wall material after its collapse. Iron. Eleven iron objects were found. The most notable of these was a plough-share (Fig. 53) which, as already noted, was found above the gravel layer in the centre of the hut. The high level at which it was found?over the gravel deposit?indicates that it was introduced on to the site after the hut had been abandoned. It is similar to two plough</page><page sequence="147">?

A fragment of an iron knife was found under the humus in Cutting 5. It is much corroded, but is similar to those from Early Christian and Mediaeval sites. The remaining iron finds consists of fragments of nails, a fragment of sheet iron and an oval object which looks like the loop of a key. Fig. 53.?Site I: Plough-share (i). DISCUSSION. The excavations here described are of significance from two view points?that of house structure and that of the accompanying material equipment, especially the pottery. Compared with the large number of houses of the Danubian cultures and the growing number of early houses investigated in northern lands the total of dwellings of Neolithic or Bronze Age date in Western Europe is small. Known comparable sites in Great Britain and Ireland are notably few, and, indeed, in Ireland these are the first domestic structures of this early period to have been 136 "irish Agriculture in Early Historic Times", J.R.S.A.I., 74 (1944), 138 and fig. 5 : 1 and 2. [2n2]</page><page sequence="148">444 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. excavated. They, therefore, provide a welcome addition to our knowledge of living conditions in Neolithic and Bronze Age times. It is of further importance that we deal with a number of dwellings in a small area and that several of these were occupied contemporaneously, and were also contemporary with other sites not dealt with here?the enclosed circular sites such as K and L of Windle's enumeration. This means that we are dealing not with an isolated dwelling, but with what must have been a village community. Statistics giving even tentative suggestions as to the number of houses or the number of inhabitants would be quite useless in the circumstances. The sites investigated on Knockadoon were in each case selected because of some surface indications. It has been noted that the surface indications, which in some instances were very* slight, gave no reason to suspect the full extent of the sites. Site C and Site C, 1949 gave good evidence of this. It is, therefore, practically certain that houses existed on Knockadoon, especially on the southern slope, at places where there are now no surface indications. To arrive at any estimate of the density of dwellings there, would involve the excavation of a very large area?a task which would take many years to complete and which may well be left for the future, when techniques, as yet undeveloped, are available and when the work can be viewed in the light of fresh knowledge and newly realised problems. At any rate, the Knockadoon dwellings, together with other sites excavated at Lough Gur, provide a considerable body of information which helps to give a picture of the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age in a restricted area in southern Ireland. The information concerns field monuments of various types?not only the Knockadoon houses here dealt with, but also the other Knockadoon habitations, the stone circles, the megalithic tombs, the barrows and other sites. It also concerns a large body of find material which, in varying amount, is represented on these sites, but which is available in greatest bulk on Knockadoon, and hence the discoveries there tend to give the general framework for the other local material and, ultimately, for much of the Irish development. In dealing with the Knockadoon discoveries it is proposed to discuss first the structures and then the finds. In the building of the Knockadoon houses it is clear that wood was of primary importance. In no case is there evidence of real wall-building by means of stones. Stones were used on several of the sites to provide a foundation course, and, in fact, it was the use of stones in this manner on Site A which drew our attention to the Knockadoon houses in the first instance. The manner of using stones?on edge or irregularly piled together?precluded the building of a wall of any height; the expression "stone walls'' has been used for convenience in the foregoing pages, but it is not intended to imply more than the recognition of a stone foundation course.</page><page sequence="149">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 445 The main body of the wall must in all cases have been of perishable material?of organic material such as brushwood, reeds, grass or of sods or clay. Clay is improbable because it is likely that its remains would have been evident on excavation. In the case of houses where posts stood outside and inside the wall, the material used in the body of the wall must have been held between them as a compact mass, probably with the aid of horizontal timbers. Organic materials would serve well for the building of such a wall and on the whole their use appears most likely. There is, however, reason to believe that sods were used as building material on other early sites on Knockadoon. The circles, which Windle137 enumerated as K and L, and which he regarded as stone circles, are in fact enclosed habitation sites defined by a concentric double kerbing, best preserved on K, but to be seen also on other sites of irregular outline on Knockadoon. Between the double kerbing there is now a light scatter of stones, but there is no indication on any of these sites that the walls were built up with stone. The enclosing wall would have been effective if built up with sods and such building would, when the wall had disintegrated, account for the light stone scatter derived from them. Method of wall-building and plan of house varied on the Knockadoon sites. Rectangular houses occurred on Sites A, E, F and also on Site B, to judge by the portion of straight wall belonging to the earliest stage of occupation there. Houses of round or curvilinear plan occurred on Sites C, D and G. Site I had a house of irregularly rectangular outline, while Site H did not give any satisfactory plan. Wall-building by means of a foundation of stones combined with a double row of posts to hold the material of the upper portion of the wall was not the only method employed. A double row of posts without stone foundation course or with foundation trench was also used (Sites C and D), and a single irregular row of slender posts was noted in one instance (Site C, 1949). In some cases the stone foundation course was not accompanied by formally placed post-holes for uprights along the walls; for instance House I on Site D had a central post-hole, but no evidence for wall-posts and it is possible that the rafters sloped down to the stones. Other than plan and possible methods of wall building, few other details of construction have left evidence which can be discussed with profit. Drawings based on models in Cork Public Museum are given (Fig. 54) as tentative reconstructions of a round and a rectangular house.138 The roofs were doubtless of organic material, presumably of thatch. In most cases we can take it that rafters were carried on the uprights, but in the round house of Site C, 1949 the combination of single 137 p.R.I,A., 30 C (1912), 283-306. These sites have been excavated, but the report is not yet published. Site J of Windle is similar in structure, but its history is complicated by reason of its use as a cemetery. 138 From Cork Public Museum : Souvenir Guide to the First Exhibition (Cork, 1945), PI. II.</page><page sequence="150">446 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. rows of light wall posts and central post would suggest that the wall posts were brought together?bird-cage fashion?at the centre.139 In a few cases where houses were built near suitable rocks the vertical rock faces were utilised to form portions of the walls?as on Sites E, F, G and, to a lesser extent, on Site D (House I). Within most of the houses there was evidence of a hearth, accom panied in some instances by a pit, which appears to have served as a Fig. 54.?Suggested reconstructions of round and rectangular houses, Knockadoon (after Corle Public Museum Guide). rubbish pit. Similar pits, the purpose of which is not certain, occurred outside the houses and fires were lighted in the open air also. In most houses no special flooring was observed, but on some sites (A, B, C and H) portions of paving of flat stones remained. Here and there on Knockadoon small lengths of terracing are to be noted, usually across a small valley between two rock outcrops. -This terracing was most marked in the valley which crosses Knockadoon and 1M In the manner of the house shown by Clark (after Bersu), Prehistoric Europe (London, 1952), Fig. 76.</page><page sequence="151">? R?ordain?Lough Gur Excavations. 447 the Site I evidence indicates its ear'Jy date. On Site D such terracing was associated with habitation, though not with its earliest phase. On Site C enclosing walte, which also served to terrace the hill-slope, were found ; these also were later than the first occupation, but on the north edge of Site C, 1949 a clay bank associated with posts appeared to have been an early feature of the site. The size of the houses varied considerably as did also the degree of intensity of habitation which they exhibited. The circular houses on Site C were of reasonable size (about 17' diameter) and gave good evidence of occupation. The rectangular buildings on Site A and Site E were also of good size, but showed meagre signs of habitation. The hut on Site G built against a wall face was so small that it can hardly have served as more than a temporary shelter. In the matter of economy the natural environment was of importance. The Limerick plain, part of the Golden Vein, is exceptionally good farm land. It is, however, in the main, low-lying ; the soil is heavy and drainage is inadequate. The Lough Gur area consists essentially of a group of hills encircling the lake and contrasting sharply with the surrounding plain. The area lies on the lower limestone, which is the material of the hills around the lake.140 The hills are comparatively low?the highest being Knockfennel to the north of the lake which rises to 531 feet above sea level (about 2807 above the level of the lake), while the summit of Knockadoon is slightly over 400' above sea level. The picturesque scenery of the Lough Gur district is due to the rugged character of these hills. Their importance from the viewpoint of pre historic settlement lies in the fact that they carry a comparatively thin covering of light soil. The limestone has weathered freely, giving rise to what is geologically described as a mature limestone landscape. Its features are especially well exemplified on Knockadoon where drift occurs only in very limited areas on the northern side of the peninsula,141 and where the bare limestone outcrops irregularly or is lightly covered by a fertile soil. The weathering of the limestone has given rise to rugged hillocks and small valleys and to the more marked north-south valley which crosses Knockadoon. The aerial photograph and the general views (Pis. XIII, XIV) give some idea of the landscape which provides the natural background for the prehistoric settlement. It is similar to the weathered limestone areas elsewhere in Ireland, and though the Lough Gur features are on a much smaller scale they readily bring to mind the limestone hills and chasms of the rich passage-grave district of 140 Igneous rocks form a narrow belt of hills to the north?from Grange eastward to Herbertstown and Kilteely?but they do not touch the lake. Knockderc HiU to the south east is also igneous. The geology of the district is dealt with in Explanations to accompany Sheet 15!? of the Geological Survey of Ireland (Dublin, 1861). 141 These small areas are not shown on the Geological Map which indicates that the lake touches on a larger " cover of drift, mainly limestone graver,' at the south-west.</page><page sequence="152">448 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Carrowkeel, Co. Sligo, the type of scenery which, as Childe has remarked, would welcome Iberian immigrants with a landscape similar to that which they had left.142 At present tree-growth on Knockadoon is limited in extent. Apart from some scattered patches consisting of small trees and bushes it is mainly confined to the areas around the two castles (where it is presumably due to planting) and to the more precipitous eastern slope between the castles where interference from cattle would be minimised and trees could become established. It cannot be argued that Knockadoon was equally open at the beginning of human settlement, but tree cover would not have been difficult to deal with?by fire or otherwise.143 Once cleared, the land would have been attractive for settlement because of its excellent drainage and sheltered valleys and because of the pleasant southern slope from which came so much of our evidence of early dwellings. On all these counts the Knockadoon area would have presented attractions above those of the general expanse of the Limerick plain.144 Further, the fact that the lake offered a convenient water supply must have been of importance for a people whose cattle provided so large a portion of their food supply. In late mediaeval times the lake made Knockadoon an area of strategic importance, the approaches to which were guarded by the two castles ; it is doubtful, however, if the consideration of defence weighed with the pre historic dwellers?there are no indications of warlike activities?but the lake may have served as a natural boundary which would prevent the straying of flocks and herds. There is some evidence to indicate that the lake was smaller in prehistoric and early historic times than it is at present. This has already been noted in connexion with the hut sites known as the Spectacles,145 and is shown by the numerous worked flints and bone fragments to be found on the lake bottom off the western extremity of Knockadoon?almost certainly due to human settlement in the area when the lake level was lower than it now is; the finds are too far from the present shore to allow of their having been thrown from there.146 In the absence of the causeways which form the approaches to the two castles, even a smaller lake than that which now exists might well have caused Knockadoon to be virtually an island?surrounded in part by open water, in part by marsh. 142 Prehistoric Communities_, p. 34. 143 Clark in Antiquity, 74 (1945), 57 and in Prehistoric Europe : The Economic Basis (London, 1952), Chapter IV and passim. 144 That activity in prehistoric times did in fact extend to the surrounding area is shown by some of the excavated sites indicated on the portion of the \" map, Plate XII., by finds and by sites of destroyed megalithic tombs (these last mainly on the drift in the Holy Cross area). i?

R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 449 Against this natural background of limestone hills and surrounding lake we envisage the economy of the Knockadoon dwellers as having been based largely on domestic animals, of which the bones were found in considerable quantities, and to a minor extent on agriculture. Wild animals may at times have helped to augment the food supply, but the bones available (mainly some remains of red deer, bird bones and fish vertebrae147) do not suggest that they were of economic importance. Small scale tillage is attested by the terracing and it is possible that some of the rubbing stones found were used as the lower stones of querns?though most were likely to have been employed for grinding stone axes. The use of certain objects or materials which could not have been obtained locally gave evidence of contacts further afield. It appears definite that some of the axes?or the porcellanite from which they were made?came from the Tievebulliagh-Rathlin districts in Co. Antrim. The greenstone from which many of the axes were manufactured and the material of the stone beads appear also to have been imports to the district, though probably from Irish sources. The glass beads were, it may be accepted, imported in a manufactured state; their resemblance to some from Egypt has been stressed and this suggests their place of origin?in Egypt or elsewhere in the Mediterranean area. One small object of gold (Site D) and some pieces of lignite are also clues to outside contacts. The possession of bronze implied trade with metal-producing areas, but more important in the matter of trade and economy is the fact that bronze objects were being cast on Knockadoon. This means that copper and tin had to be obtained from outside sources, and though the evidence available is for the Middle Bronze Age only, it is possible that local manufacture was responsible for bronzes of earlier and later date. Among the prolific finds from the Lough Gur area (mainly discovered after the nineteenth-century drainage) all sub-periods of the Bronze Age are represented. The pottery is the most important item of the material equipment from the Knockadoon sites. It occurred there in greater quantity than on any other site of early date excavated in Ireland,148 and because of the occurrence of different wares on certain of the sites it is possible to present conclusions as to sequence and relationship which would not be justified were the amount of material less and the period of occupation shorter. The variety of the pottery gives indication of mixed contacts and of a population group which was constantly receiving new cultural impulses, 147 Horse bones are also present in very meagre amount and it is not certain if they are from domestic animals. 148 Lyles Hill near Belfast appears to be its nearest rival in this respect but the same variety of wares as at Knockadoon does not occur on the northern site.</page><page sequence="154">450 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. and, presumably, new immigrants. That habitation was continuous from Neolithic to Middle Bronze Age times is indicated by the sites (C and D) which were occupied without indication of interruption over this period. Other sites were occupied for shorter periods, but they lie within thei same chronological range. The sequence observed for the pottery is a continuous one which shows changing fashions and in which one type fades out against the growing popularity of a later one, but without breaks or sharp changes. Short period sites in the locality gave corroboration of particular phases in the sequence,* such sites were the great stone circle at Grange,149 the Rathjordan sites (especially No. 3),lfi0 and the Rockbarton hearths.151 The conclusions regarding the pottery sequence and the relative chronology it indicates, are based on the total body of evidence as given by the sites on Knockadoon and the others in the Lough Gur neighbourhood. The fact that pottery styles were not mutually exclusive but changed gradually, implies that a site cannot be confidently placed in the sequence by a small amount of pottery of a single type. Thus for example Site E produced a single fragment of Class I pottery and is tentatively placed early in the sequence (Fig. 55), but it is possible that the absence of other types of pottery is fortuitous and that Site E should be placed later. In general the sequence of pottery styles is as represented on the diagram (Fig. 55). It begins with a phase when Class I or la was exclusively in use. This phase was not recognisable on all sites?usually there was on the original ground level a preponderance of Class I and la ware, but also some Class II. However, at the north of Site C, 1949 and sealed by the layer of yellow clay was an earliest stratum which contained I and la pottery only. To this phase belonged also the burial with the la pot. Class la, clearly a more elaborate variant of Class I, had a much shorter period of popularity than had the less specialised type. The heavy, ornamented rims are characteristic of the lowest levels?on Site C, Site D and Site B. With these elaborate rims Class la pots had pronounced shoulders, but similar shoulders appeared on Class I vessels with simple rims of various forms. The statement that Class la ceased at an early stage is equivalent to saying that a tendency to simplification caused the discontinuance of the elaborate rims and their accompanying ornament. The same tendency led subsequently to the further simplification of Class I by the omission of shoulders. The latest Class I pots are, therefore, of simple rim and profile. This fact has already been remarked on in the report on the Grange circle (referred to in connexion with Site H above), where, in an Early Bronze Age context, the Neolithic Class I type pottery had lived on, but in a simplified form. i4?

Its quality tends to deteriorate and paste, surface and firing are worse in the later stages than in the earlier ones. It evidently was the ordinary domestic ware and, though in contemporary use with Beaker and Food Vessel, it was found on the Knockadoon sites in much larger quantities than they, though the contrary was true on the Grange stone circle and in the Lough Gur megalith. In fact, in the case of the stone circle the Class II pottery occurred mainly in the bank, where it had BEAKE? FOODVESSEt SITE C r?! SITE O SITE A D I940 SITE B D ?

It ifc clear, therefore, that in general the more elaborate wares were used for ritual and burial, while the plainer types were connected with everyday domestic uses. It still remains true that decorated pots were i? use on the domestic sites. We have already noted the Class la ??ts which were ornamented on rims and shoulders. Ornament was not general over the surface of these vessels as it was on the later types?Beaker and Food Vessel. Ornament on Class II pots was crude and showed little variety. It</page><page sequence="156">452 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. consisted mainly of incised scorings, but cord impressions and raised cordons occurred. The former are important because of the rare occurrence of cord on the other Knockadoon wares; the latter are of possible importance because they are in some cases applied and give, as at Skara Brae, an early use of the technique which is found on the encrusted urns. Because of its specialised character and its widespread relationships, the occurrence of Beaker in considerable quantities on the Knockadoon sites is of great significance. It provides a chronological datum which brings these sites into relation with those in Britain and on the Continent and it gives some suggestion of cultural relationships. It is now with somewhat of a shock that we look at the map which accompanied del Castillo's study of European Beakers,152 published in 1928, and find under his "Grupo de Irlanda" a single site marked?the find-place of the Beakers from Moytirra, Co. S'ligo. Until the 1930's the position remained virtually unchanged. During the early years of that decade the new finds came mainly from megalithic tombs in the north of Ireland; in 1938 Beaker was found in the gallery grave at Lough Gur, and in 1939 in the Grange stone circle.153 The three sites excavated in the course of the 1940 excavation campaign at Lough Gur?(C and D described in this paper and Circle K, Windle)?all produced Beaker and gave for the first time in Ireland instances of habitation sites on which Beaker occurred prolifically. Subsequent excavations on Knockadoon and on other sites near Lough Gur gave confirmation of the importance of the r?le of Beaker and gave added instances of its relationship to other pottery types. It is clear that the Beaker folk must have formed a significant ethnic element in the population of the Lough Gur area, but, as has already been argued,154 an element which readily coalesced with the local population. In the material record this fusion must have influenced the development and, in particular, the decorative scheme of the native Food Vessel. That the Food Vessel developed at an early stage is clearly demonstrated by other excavations at or near Lough Gur,155 and on the basis of that evidence the position of the Food Vessel is given on the diagram (Fig. 55). But further discussion of the problem of the origin and development of the Food Vessel is not relevant here, in view of the fact that this type of pottery was but sparsely represented on the Knockadoon habitation sites. That this was so is in accordance with the observation already made, that the wares in use on habitation sites 152 Albert del Castillo Yurrita,La Cultura del Vaso Campaniforme, Barcelona, 1928. The position regarding Beaker in Ireland in this book shows no change from that given by Abercromby, Bronze Age Pottery in 1912. isa P.R.I.A., 54 C (1951), 37. * ibid., p. 72. "5 Ibid., p. 70.</page><page sequence="157">? B?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 453 are normally less ornamented than those which occur on burial and ritual sites. Food Vessel must by definition be regarded as a highly ornamented class of pottery, evolved and developed for religious purposes. In this it differs from Beaker, which tends to show the same rich ornament independent of the purpose?domestic or religious?for which it is intended. Knockadoon did, however, provide a burial (Site C, 1949) which is a precursor of the normal inhumed Irish Food Vessel burial?with crouched body and with bowl near the head. This, however, does no more than indicate an early example of the burial custom subsequently developed and reinforced?perhaps by impulses from international custom as represented by the Beaker burials elsewhere. But the development of Food Vessel ware may owe borrowings to many sources?to the ornamented pottery of Class la (which was the type of pot with the burial on Site C, 1949) to the Class II with its heavier ware and flat base, to Beaker especially in the matter of ornamental borrowings, and to the traditions represented by the group of sherds treated as "Miscellaneous" on several sites. The amalgam of tradition which must have gone to the development of Food Vessel and which was in fact the essence of the Early and Middle Irish Bronze Age is well exemplified in the varied equipment and in the diverse building traditions and types of sites on Knockadoon and in the Lough Gur area in general. It remains to ask where were the origins of these traditions?in fact from whence came the people who were responsible for the sites we have been investigating. The question is not easily answered; a final answer is not possible, and in the nature of archaeological research it seems likely that the answer must be influenced by adventitious factors?especially by the degree to which sites of the same period have been investigated elsewhere and by our knowledge of the relevant findings. It is likely that the answer which would now be given is not the same as that which would have found favour some years ago and is not necessarily the same as that which will be regarded as correct after further years of work. In the first place we must consider the Class I and la pottery. This belongs to the Western Neolithic family of wares, but, as the term "Western" suggests, the group is spread over a great area?from its place of origin in Northern Africa, through the Iberian Peninsula, France. Switzerland, the Rhineland and Great Britain and Ireland. General similarities link the whole "Western" family; regional differences give distinction to the various groups. The Lough Gur pottery exemplifies this. Its general characteristics can be paralleled readily elsewhere in Ireland, in Britain and, in varying degree, on the Continent; certain peculiarities are more difficult to parallel. The most notable of these local peculiarities is the broad club- or T-rim of the Knockadoon Class la</page><page sequence="158">454 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. pottery. This is not closely paralleled in Ireland156 and is even less so in Britain, yet it, perhaps, helps to provide a clue to the origin of this pottery. One of the recent developments in archaeological writing is to note afresh and in more detail the significance of the Iberian Peninsula for the prehistory of Great Britain and Ireland. Of relevance to this and to the question of the origin of our Knockadoon pottery is the comparison which Childe has made between the Neolithic wares from Abingdon and those from Vila Nova de S. Pedro, Portugal,157 and this point has been amplified and further rim sections published in a note by the excavators of the latter site.158 The similarities in texture are dealt with by Childe and the correspondence in rim form is readily apparent, but a study of the more abundant profiles from Vila Nova (as published in the second paper referred to) suggests that a greater number of correspondences could be found in the Knockadoon material. This is especially true in the matter of flattened, out-turned rims which, though less elaborate and less exaggerated than our Class la, are likely to be related to them. It can, therefore, be suggested that this rather specialized characteristic of the Knockadoon pottery finds origin in the Iberian Peninsula159 rather than in some nearer region. Other characteristics? such as form and texture?bring the Lough Gur pottery into relation with the wares of France and Britain, but it is noteworthy that the closest relationship with the pottery of Great Britain is with a group in the south-west,160 which may indicate contacts across the south of the Irish Sea161 or descent from a common origin. The suggestion of Iberian origins given by the Class la pottery is emphasised by a number of other items discovered at Lough Gur?the abundant bone points, the bone beads and segment bone beads, the stone beads and pendants and other items.162 Nor are these necessarily the only evidences of contacts with Iberia. Dr. Savory has recently argued163 in favour of an increased recognition of the r?le of the Iberian Peninsula 156 It is reminiscent of the rim-forms of some of the Sandhill pottery, e.g., Dundrum, J.R.S.A.I., 68 (1938), 74, that from Lambay, P.R.I.A., 38 (1929), 240, and to a lesser extent of the pots from Rath and Linkardstown and from Kiltale and Norrismount (references in P.R.I.A., 54 C (1951), 7), but the flattened rim of the Knockadoon pottery is distinctive from the relatives quoted. 157 Revista de Guimar?es, 40 (1950), 5. 158 Afonso do Pa?o and Maria de Lourdes Costa Arthur in O. Instituto, 115 (1952), ?-18. 159 Horizontal rims with ornament occur on the so-called " hat-shaped bowls " dated to the end of the Bronze Age (Savory, P.P.S., 15 (1949), 135) and it is possible to think of them and of the rims of our Class la as descended from a common predecessor. 160 Exemplified for instance by material excavated by Mrs. Audrey Williams at Clegyr Boia, Pembrokeshire, which I was shown by the excavator in St. Alban's Museum, and which Professor Piggott (in correspondence) has compared to sherds from other Welsh sites and from Hembury, Devon, and elsewhere in the south-west. 161 As does the A-Beaker from the Grange stone circle. 162 Parallels (some of which have been cited in this paper) are readily found in Leisner, Die Megalithgr?ber der Iberischen Halbinsel, Berlin, 1943. 163 Revista de Guimar?es, 40 (1950), 5.</page><page sequence="159">? R?ord?in?Lough Gur Excavations. 4Ci in the movement of the Beaker Folk, especially in the matter of the colonisation of Great Britain. It is at any rate a fact that much of the ornament found on the Lough Gur Beakers could be paralleled in south west Europe. In his discussion of the occurrence of Beaker in the south of Ireland164 Dr. Savory is perhaps inclined to over-simplify the story by bringing the Co. Limerick Beakers into relationship with the south western rock-scribings from which they are geographically separated. The truth seems to be that there came into Ireland from Iberia various impulses brought by successive bands of immigrants. Lough Gur, on a miniature scale, reflects the larger incursions. The contacts with south west Europe were probably brought by small bands of settlers who were absorbed by the local population and whose coming ranged in date from Neolithic times through the early part of the Bronze Age. The question of contacts and influences must not, however, be over simplified. Apart from contacts with south-west Europe, others are indicated by the material. In the first place there are some slight indications of the absorbtion of an indigenous population by the new comers to the area.165 The miscellaneous groups of pottery found on Knockadoon and on the other Lough Gur sites include wares which provide evidences for contacts with the Neolithic B of Britain.166 The A-Beaker from the Grange stone circle demonstrates the close contact with the Bristol channel area, while the reconstructed Beaker base from Site T&gt; was found to have its closest parallel in Germany. Finally the establishment of Class II pottery as representing a significant element in the Neolithic and Bronze Age cultures of Ireland is at once an important advance and an indication of problems to which only tentative answers can be given. From the view-point of chronology it is important to realise that this type of pottery can be early and that sites on which it occurs need' not, as formerly, be relegated' to Late Bronze Age or Iron Age times. On the other hand, when similar pottery is found in these late contexts, consideration must be given to the problem of whether it is due to continuity or is a newly-imported type.167 The main problem of the Class II pottery is that of its origin. It has already been suggested that it is related to the Horgen ware of the 164 Evidently written on the basis of the Rockbarton publication P.R.I.A., 48 C (1942), 255. Some of the Lough Gur Beaker has parallels in Scotland. This may be due to a common source rather than to contacts from Scotland. Savory appears to be quite correct when he argues that the Limerick Beakers represent an earlier settlement than do the more degenerate vessels found in the north of Ireland. les The inclusion of the Bann Flake form among the flints is a possible indication of this absorbtion. The numerous flints which can be gathered on the shores of Garrett Island are, perhaps, relics of the earliest inhabitants of the area who may have been Mesolithic?at least in economy. 166 P.R.I.A., 54 C (1951), 71. 167 These matters have been briefly discussed in the Grange report, P.R.I.A., 54C (1951), 69, and more fully in the Report of the Third International Congress of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Science, Zurich, 1950 (ed. E. Vogt, Zurich, 1953), 188-192.</page><page sequence="160">456 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Continent and that it reached Ireland along the same route as did the gallery graves, since Horgen pottery and gallery graves are found in the S.O.M. culture in Prance.168 The resemblances to the Horgen wares give weight to this theory, but are not sufficiently close to make it certain. The Class II wares at Lough Gur belong to a group of heavy, mainly flat-based wares which are now accepted as part of the equipment of Neolithic and Bronze Age times.169 Under various names?Grooved ware, Skara Brae-Rinyo, Ronaldsway?these wares are spread from southern Britain to the Orkneys and the Isle of Man. Their Continental counterparts are varied : Dutch parallels have been quoted, Horgen and S.O.M. are possibilities, but it is not impossible that the Spanish cave pottery has something to do with the story. Its texture appears similar, its shapes include parallels for those of our pottery and among its techniques is encrustation, which appears scantily at Knockadoon and more plentifully in the Skara Brae-Rinyo group. Perhaps a combination of these theories is the truth and that Class II represents the local expression of a tendency to produce a type of pottery which in various forms was spreading through Western Europe. The excavations here published have yielded a considerable amount of material and it is hoped that the publication of this material will help to provide a background and a framework against which sites with comparable equipment may be considered. Many problems remain unsolved, and to some, tentative answers only can be given. It is hoped that further work at Lough Gur will help to some extent to fill the gaps. But the hope expressed some years ago170 may again be reiterated?that Lough Gur should not remain an isolated phenomenon. It is much to be desired that a similar region be investigated?perhaps on the megalithic limestone areas in the west, perhaps in the neighbourhood of the metal producing mountains of the south-west.171 The comparison should prove valuable in helping to eliminate peculiarities which are reactions to local environments and, in the residue, recognising the common content which might be traced with some assurance to its source. 168 p.RJ.A., 48 C (1941), 271. 169 Flat-based ware was found, though not frequently, among the Abingdon pottery, (Leeds, Ant. Jour., 7 (1927), 453) and ibid., 8 (1928), 474,) but appears to have been lost sight of until the recognition of " Grooved Ware ". Flat-based ware was found with classic Peterborough pottery at the name-giving site (Leeds, Ant. Jour., 2 (1922), 22S). Studies, Dec, 1944, 475-486. 171 An example alreadv forthcoming from the south-west is the site excavated at Carrigillihy, Co. Cork, by Professor O'Kelly (J.C.H.A.S., 36 (1951), 59). Pottery showing affinities to the Knockadoon wares was discovered there in an area?the West Cork and Kerry coastal region?in which no prehistoric pottery had previously been known.</page><page sequence="161">?

It began with the discovery and excavation of Site A, in 1939, and occupied most of seven seasons' effort between that year and 1949, when the northern portion of Site C was excavated. During this period many helpers took part in the work?so many that the list of their names would be too long for inclusion here, and a selection would involve invidious choice. To all, best thanks are returned ?for their help and for their cheerful companionship at Lough Gur, not only during the years when war-time shortages were not felt, but also, and more especially, during the years when we knew many inconveniences of rationing and scarcity. All these sites were excavated on the land of the late Robert Ryan, t.d. Mr. Ryan not only gave permission for the excavation, but extended friendship and kindly help to us during our time in Lough Gur. Ar dheis D? go^ raibh a anam. The work at Lough Gur was carried out by local workmen whose loyalty and keenness it is a pleasure to acknowledge. None of them will object if we mention especially, Mr. Tom Bourke, of Herbertstown, whose joy in the finding o? a potsherd, a bead, or a post-hole, was an indication of his interest. To the many experts in various fields whose names are mentioned in the foregoing pages, thanks are due for their assistance. We trust they will accept this expression of gratitude without enumeration of their names and of their contributions to our knowledge. For generous help with the preparation of this paper for publication, thanks are due to Miss M?ire MacDermott, m.a. Finance for the work was mainly provided from Government funds, under the Relief of Unemployment Schemes (subsequently the Special Employment Schemes), and some of the drawing of the finds and restoration of pottery carried out in 1941 was paid for by a grant from the Murphy Bequest, administered by the . Department of Education. Smaller amounts from the University Colleges of Cork and Dublin helped in the excavations, and were particularly welcome during the lean years of the war, when Government funds were not available to us.
