<plain_text><page sequence="1">Section V: ARCHAEOLOGY Sectional President's Address UNDERSTANDING PATTERNS OF CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE POST- HARAPPAN PERIOD (2nd MILLENNIUM TO 600 BCE): A STUDY ON ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATABASE Asok Dutta Mr President, Fellow Delegates, Distinguished Scholars, Ladies and Gentlemen. At the very outset I express my deep sense of Gratitude to the organizing Committee of the Indian History Congress for giving me the honour to Chair the Archaeology Section of the 70th Indian History Congress here in Delhi University. I am deeply honoured for this invitation. I feel humbled too. Honoured because the invitation has come form the Indian History Congress, an organization that has devoted and dedicated largely and significantly in the writing of the history of our land and people and has added considerably to the image and glory of our past and has helped develop a scientific academic discipline for writing history without being guided by emtion. Humbled, because I never claimed myself a professional archaeologist. In fact, I am less professional than the Indian archaeologists whose contributions have made the Indian history more scientific and meaningful. Finally, I take this opportunity to thank you all from the core of my heart. Introduction: Scope of the Problem The history of human culture is the history of continued change from one form to another through time and space. But the rate of thee changes in culture/ material history is not uniform - in some area the rate of change is faster while in some other the rate is very slow largely depending upon the nature of form and substances of such interactions. In the total process environment plays the key role. The term environment implies a state of condition of a specific in relation to temperature, rainfall, forest including bio-diversity of the region etc which effects both animal and plant life. This, in turn, effects and influences human responses in the form of cultural changes and adaptation. Different regions have environments resulting in different form of cultural groups or human responses. In this context Griffith Taylor (1953) pointed out that "Nature determines the route of development while man determines the rate and the stage."</page><page sequence="2">918 I HC: Proceedings , 70th Session , 2009-10 Why the highly sophisticated socio-economic system of Harappan urban life disappeared is not clear to the archaeologists. In fact, the Harappan civil amenities disappeared as indicated by a total departure of all forms of urban characters (Allchin, 2003; Agrawal, 1982). The sophisticated Harappan monochrome, biochrome and polychrome polterye with lab√≥rate naturalistic and abstract designs gradually replaced by greater proportion of plain handmade and sometime burnished ware indicating also a charge in manufacturing technique (Lai and Gupta, 1984) Why there was a shift from urban to nomadic agro-pastoral life? The disintegration or decline of the Indus valley civilization gave rise a number of regional and sub-regional cultures having different mode of adaptations and technologies. Many possible explanations have been put forwarded by different scholars, but none of them is satisfactory. In fact, the reason of Harappan disintegration lies within the psychology of its people, its attitude towards the monotonous uniformity of Harappan culture. The people were fad up with the system. The psychic of the people of demanded changes. Around 2500 BCE and onwards (2500-1750) we have on the one hand one of the oldest civilization flourishing in the north-west India with elaborate Socio-economic systems and five metropolitan cities and hundreds of satellite towns controlling the production and distribution systems to maintain the uniformity and standard of quality over one million square kilometer area (Lai and Gupta, 1984) and on the other hand we have hunting /gathering among many tribal communities in central, eastern and south India. Surprisingly in between these two extreme economic orders, we have many intermediate forms of adaptations. To understand the process of change and survival mechanism, one has to be acquainted with the form and substances of social and economic interactions in the backdrop of contemporary environment. The successful adaptation in the early Holocene environmental landscape by the Mesolithic hunter/ gatherers in the Indian Sub-Continent is evidently clear from the wide distribution of Mesolithic sites. The stability of this self sufficient subsistence economy is indicated by both vertical and horizontal spread of the culture. In fact, the Mesolithic way of life was most successful means of adaptation through the length and breadth of the Indian Sub- Continent except the major alluvium river valleys, but in north east India a different pattern of Stone Age development was influenced and guided by the south-east Asian way of life style. In India no culture, in the Holocene Period, was as successful as that of the Mesolithic with its hunting/ gathering mode of subsistence technology. But towards the late Holocene i.e. from 2nd millennium BC there was an oblique shift in the attitude of Mesolithic way of life due to pressure created by the extension of agricultural land at the expanse of forest to meet the growing demand of different peasant communities who dispersed more towards the east than in the south after the disintegration of Harappan Civilization around 1 800 BCE. In fact, after the decline of Indus civilization, there were large scale movements of people with different regional cultural identities within and outside the Indus system to different directions.</page><page sequence="3">Archaeology 919 The Mesolithic hunter/ gatherers readjusted themselves in the changed situation by developing in a mutual understanding of symbiosis between them. During this time there were intense movements of people across the Subcontinent with different technologies occupying different space in the natural habitats. There were agricultural communities, agriculture cum pastoral communities, Pastoral communities, hunting/ gathering cum Pastoral communities, even semi-urban organized communities of Gujrat and Rajasthan etc. despite high mobility of these people across India along with higher form of technology, the sophisticated Mesolithic mode of subsistence economy was not potentially replaced by either Neolithic or later Chalcolithic or even in some cases by early urban societies. Similarly the Neolithic farmers were not replaced by Chalcolithic everywhere or Chalcolithic by early urban societies. However through close interactions between these groups, they reached an accommodation for both sides in a balanced system of exchange (Possehl, 1 990). In fact, the most crucial period of the Indian history is between 1 800 BCE (Collapse of Harappan urban socio-economic system, and 600 BCE (the beginning of second urbanization in Ganga valley). During this time none of the subsistence economy practiced by different communities/ groups in their respective ecological zones was self sufficient to meet the basic demand of their growing population. Archaeological evidences suggest that all the contemporary peasant communities /groups including Neolithic, Chalcolithic, and other forms of subsistence modes had to depend partially on hunting or pastoral economy to supplement the deficit in agricultural productions. Naturally they looked for other sources to supplement the economy. It is in this context that they came into contact with different other ethnic groups and developed some kind of mutual reciprocity of exchange of either technology or commodities. Possechl ( 1 990) has referred the Case of Langhnaj in Gujrat and Bagor in Rajasthan as good examples of this kind of symbiosis between different communities. He also stressed that this kind of situation was very much present in the rest of India. The process of transformation from hunting /gathering to agro-pastoral economy involving higher technical manipulation has already been started in different parts of India, but the rate of change was not uniform everywhere depending upon the nature of contacts, interactions and landscape since in the new economy Man-land relation became more crucial than ever before. Nature of archaeological evidence The disintegration of the Indus valley civilization around 1800 BCE was followed by the development of a number of regional cultures with different mode of subsistence economy, but among them the village farming communities occupying alluvium zones were most important. These early village framing communities were further marked by regional and sub-regional diversities. But they all shared a common character which makes them quite unique in a diverse ecological backdrop. They were basically agriculturists (Datta, 2007). These early agricultural communities are designated by different names such as Late Harappan Culture, Cemetry H culture, Gandhara Grave culture, Copper hoard culture, Chalcolithic culture, Black and red ware culture,</page><page sequence="4">920 I HC: Proceedings, 70th Session, 2009-10 Painted grey ware culture, Neolithic culture, Megalithic culture etc. Besides there were many pastoral communities in semi-arid zones of Gujrat, Rajasthan and Baluchistan and hunting /gathering communities in central, eastern and southern India. In some areas stone was the major technology while in some other areas copper or copper/bronze was the principal metal technology and still in some other areas iron seemed to dominate over copper/ bronze/stone technology. This period is therefore very crucial for understanding the historical process of India (Datta, 2008). Since the period is marked by regional and sub-regional diversities, the mode of adaptation in different landscapes was also different. Archaeological records suggest the existence of several forms xof adaptations like the hunting/ gathering, pastoral and agriculture. This is very much evident in each and every sites especially of the Chalcolithic and Neolithic settlement sites where excavations have revealed the discovery of large number of domesticated and wild animal species suggesting the role of domesticated and wild animal species in the dietary system of this early agricultural society. Hence this period covering from early 2nd millennium BC to 600 BCE was very crucial for understanding the formation process of second urbanization in India. The total process of proto-historic Cultural developments in India from 2nd millennium BC to the beginning of historical period (600 BCE) can be traced in two phases. Phase I is characterized by copper / bronze using people (2000-1000 BCE) and represented by Late Harappan, Cemetery H, Copper hoard culture (OCP), Gandhara grave culture (phase 1-2), Pirak (1-2) and Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures; while phase U is characterized by mainly iron using people* ( 1 1 00-600 BCE) represented by Megalithic culture, Painted grey ware culture, NBP culture, Gandhara grave culture (Phase III), Pirak (Phase III), BRW culture of central and eastern India. In both the phases, the Aryan problem or Indo-Aryan migration is very much associated. We will try to find out the relevance of Aryan problem in Indian History from archaeological view points. First Phase of Cultural developments (Copper /Bronze age Cultures, 2000- 1100 BCE) Indus system River Indus has divided the land into two broad physiographic units (Dani, 1988). The alluvium flood plains of the east of Indus system are more humid and fertile than the semi-arid hilly terrain of the west of Indus system. The Indus civilization which flourished in the east of Indus system became the major focal area of intense human activities from the middle of 3rd millennium BC (Lai, 1979; Possehl, 1982, Thaper, 1975). But our archaeological records suggest that the western part of Indus system came under sharp focus of human activities long before the eastern part (Datta, 1994). After the collapse or disintegration of the Indus valley civilization, there was a persistent change in the settlement perspectives. Highly sophisticated urban life with a strong socio-economic background disappeared around 1800 BCE and instead a nomadic life was noticed within the Harappan system. The western part of</page><page sequence="5">Archaeology 92 1 Indus system is characterized by two distinct ecological zones viz. Baluchistan in the south and Swat valley in the north. The patterns of development in both the regions are different, but some amount of similarities are also found there. Baluchistan Before the development of mature Harappan culture, Baluchistan was prosperous with intense development in its material culture. Mehargarh (Jarrige, 1998), Kiligul Mohammad, Rana Ghundai, Sur Jangal, Dam Sadat, Naushara, Bampur etc are some of the important sites in Baluchistan. Surprisingly from the early part of 2nd millennium BC, all settlements ceased to exist and practically there were no traces of human activities. In fact, the centre of focus of human activities have been shifted more towards east of Indus as settlements and irrigation system (Dams) in Baluchistan were abandoned. Not sites dating to the subsequent centuries have been found. The reason may be due to population movement or large scale and enduring shift in subsistence economy and lifestyle. The shifting to a mobile nomadic lifestyle is attested by hundreds of camps sites during late historical period in Baluchistan. During the transitional phase from settled semi-urban to mobile nomadic lifestyle, there was no major population movement. Pastoralism and nomadic life was the only mode of subsistence during this time (Allchins, 2003, Shaffer, 1974, Mughal, 1970). Baluchistan is often described as semi-arid zone with less than 10" inches rainfall per year. The area is characterized by hills and mountains with valleys in between. The elevation of the land varies from OM on the plains of Indus to 2000 M in Hindukush Moutain. The mountain and hills are separated by rivers. Unlike the rest of the plateau, Baluchistan receives rainfall in the summer due to the effect of Indian monsoon. The area is marked by highly differentiated environment with many different habitats reflected in the manifestation of many regional arid sub-regional cultures (Jim Shaffer, 1974). Pirak located on the bank of the Indus was an important site in post-Harappan era in Baluchistan. Excavation at Pirak has revealed three phases cultural development, of which phase is marked by the use of unburnt brick structure with coarse handmade pottery having applique and finger-tip impression. Besides unburnt clay figures of Horse, Camels and terracotta button seals of circular, square and curved forms have been found. Evidences of copper/ bronze and stone objects have also been reported from excavation. Second phase of Pirak shows no basic change in material culture except large number of clay and terracotta figures including Bactrian Camels and Horses with riders. Besides copper and bronze objects together with few irons occur in the upper level of phase II. Phase II of Pirak has been dated to 1370-1340 BCE. The evidences of Bactrian Horses and Camels with riders in phase I and II of Pirak suggest Persian connection through time but do not support the hypothesis of Indo-Aryan migration. The swat valley in the north during the same period of time witnessed almost a similar situation, but slightly in a different pattern. Here hundreds</page><page sequence="6">922 I HC: Proceedings, 70th Session, 2009-10 of cemeteries (Double pit burial) are found to continue for centuries without any basic and fundamental change in structure of the economy. This is popularly known as "Gandhara Grave Culture" (Stacul, 1975). It extends from Chitral in the north to Gomal River in the south to Bajnour in the west and Taxila in the south-east near Rawlpindi. Most of the sites are grave sites, but few of them like Aligrama, Bir-kot-ghundai, Balambhat etc are habitational sites (William Vogtelsang, 1988). The Gandhara grave culture flourished between 1500-500 BCE. Excavation has revealed three phases cultural development. Evidence of both cremation and inhumation and in some cases symbolic burials have been found (Stacul. 1973). The evidence of the practice of cremation is very significant form the point of view of Aryan problem in India. The pottery includes plain pottery either buff-red or grey and the shapes include pedestal cups, Beakers with flayering mouth, bottles with narrow necks and associated triple pot or three stems rising from the base. Terracotta figures of flat tablets with rough human form showing appliqu√© breasts and highly stylized heads with incised decoration are typical of this phase. Metal objects include copper and bronze and limited iron. The discovery of Horse burials in separate graves along side master and Bronze model of Horse from katelai is unique recalling identical Dog burial along side master in Kashmir valley Neolithic culture. Gandhara grave culture can be compared with Tape Hisser III, Hasaulu IV, Shah Tape, Marlik, Sialk etc (ALlchins, 2003), but Vogelsang (1988) has questioned the validity of such contacts, influences and migration between Gandhara Grave culture (Dani, 1967, 1970-71) and Iran. However despite this observation by Vogelsang (1988) there is little doubt that there were interactions between the local tradition and foreign influences. The discovery of grinding stone and saddle quern from excavation suggest that agriculture was intensified (Stacul, 1975). The material culture of Punjab and Sind in post-Harappan phase shows steady decline of Harappan influences and instead a regional cultural pattern gradually emerged. The Harappan legacy is founding Lothai II, Rojdi IB, Rangpur IIB and Prabhas Pathan. In Punjab the Harappan legacy is found in Cemetry H pottery. The evidences of cremation alongside inhumation and horse burial along with master in the copper-bronze phase are some positive evidence suggesting some kind of co-existence of more than one group of people having different disposal customs - may be Aryan or some other ethnic groups living along side the indigenous people. East of Indus Major centre of human activities in post-Harappan phase can be found throughout this region. In contrast to Baluchistan this region has enormous area of fertile soils and perennial rivers for irrigation. This is a vast geographical region which remains the main focus of human activities in post-Harappan era. The region is associated with two traditional trade routes popularly known as "Uttarapath" and "Dakshinapath". This geographical region is very crucial for understanding the movement of people, culture,</page><page sequence="7">Archaeology 923 trade and human contacts. The interactions between different and diverse elements finally laid down the foundation of state formation process in the Ganga valley around 600 BCE. Naturally this region is considered as the nucleus zone of early history of India. Within this broad geographical region there were two physiographic units viz. the doab region comprising the modern states of Punjab, Hary ana, northern parts of Rajasthan and northern parts of Uttar Pradesh and the second unit is known as Ganga plain comprising the modern states of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West-Bengal. The region is drained by the Ghaggar-Hokra, a seasonal river of India and Pakistan, active only during monsoon and it is often identified with Vedic Saraswati River. Besides, the region is also drained by Drisadvati and Ganga-Jamuna. The region is often described as "Aryabarta" or the homeland of the Aryan and the Aryan Problem centres round this region. In the former region i.e. doab region the post-Harappan development is complicated as the settlements of the region are characterized by regional and sub-regional diversities coupled with Harappan tradition. The blending of cultures is found in ceramic styles suggesting the survival of Harappan influences among the local/ regional cultures. The excavation at Mitathal (Suraj Bhan, 1975) has shown that period I correspond to early Harappan phase and closely parallel to Kalibangan period I while period IIA of Mitathal shows cultural blending of local tradition with mature Harappan elements and period IIB shows further Harappan influences and the excavator preferred to call it as late Harappan cemetery H pottery (1900-1300 BCE). In fact, the culture that developed in and around Punjab after the decline of Harappan civilization is called as Cemetery H after the cemetery found in area H at Harappa. Cremation was the practice of disposal methods of Cemetery H and even some of the burials contain human remains after cremation in painted pot in pits. The pottery was decorated with red slip and painted with antelope, peacock, Sun and other motifs in black or sometime polished. Red pottery with black paintings are often described as late "Siswal ware", Bara ware, Cemetery-H pottery and Ochre coloured pottery (OCP) which Allchin described as red ware of Harappan tradition. The presence of different regional ceramic traditions in this region suggests intense movement of people from within and outside the region. The practice of Cremation in late Harappa (Cemetery H) was unknown to the Harappan people. After cremation charred bones were collected and preserved in painted pots/ urns and placed in pit burials. Rice was major crop but marine shell objects disappear (Kenoyer 1991b). Further south of this region, the Khetri copper mines were exploited by ancient copper working people associated with Copper hoard culture. The best known site is Ganeswar in Sikar district of Rajasthan. The excavation at the site has yielded 400 copper objects including copper fish hook and copper flat axe and other objects etc. thereby suggesting the amount of copper exploited by the early copper smiths. The shapes of these copper objects are similar to mature of Harappan types. Further east to this region, in Hary ana and doab regions Harappan influences gradually decreases in the Ganga valley. Alamgir is the last archaeological site with Harappan influences in late Harappan phase. Beyond this point no Harappan influences was noticed in</page><page sequence="8">924 I HC: Proceedings , 70th Session, 2009-10 any form, and instead a copper-hoard culture is found in Doab and Ganga plains ranging in time from 2650-1 180 BCE (Dikshit, 1979). It can be divided into two major groups as the doab (Group A) and eastern groups (Group B) including Bengal-Bihar and Orissa. A third group comprising typical Axe- adze, fort Monroe sword and socketed axe etc of north west India can broadly be compared with similar artifact types form Persia and Iran. In the doab region (Group A) comprising Rajasthan, Haryana and western U.P., the major sites like Jodhpura, Siswal, Mitathal, Bara, Ambikhera, Bargaon etc show Harappan influence. While the sites in Ganga plains (Group B) like Lai Qila, Atranjikhera, Saipa etc are free from Harappan influence (Ghosh, 1973). The excavations at Atranjikhera, Lai Qila, Saipai and Ahichatra etc. show that the earliest level is Ochre Coloured pottery (OCP) followed by black and red ware where iron happens to occur at the upper level of BRW culture, but in some other cases OCP was succeeded by PGW or Painted grey ware culture which is also associated with iron. The doab variety comprises flat axe splayed edge, flat axe with semi-circular cutting edge, shouldered flat axe with edge shouldered flat axe with edge extended to form two wings as Para≈°u, anthropomorphic figures, shouldered axe or sword with tang, antennae hilts and barbed harpoons etc. The presence of mid-ridge suggests cast moulding. The eastern (Group B) variety comprises flat axe, bar Celt, shouldered Celt, double edged axe, semi-circular objects, chisel and bangles etc. Gungeria in U.P. has yielded 400 copper objects indicating the volume and dimension of the copper hoard objects found from the Ganga plains and its implication beyond the geographical limits of Ganga plains. The problem demands a thorough investigation. In fact after the pioneering work of B.B. Lai (1951) on copper-hoard culture, no serious and detailed work envisaging the whole problem in the backdrop of contemporary cultures has ever been taken up by Indian scholars. The authorship of copper-hoard culture remain controversial in Indian archaeology (Gupta, 1972) despite the claims of its close association with Indo-Aryan (Gelderen, 1936, 1937 Allchin, 2003), Harappans, West- Asiatic (Sankalia, 1974), Mundari speaking Australoids (Lai, 1972; Lai and Gupta, 1984). They mostly represent copper using craft tradition of Singhbhum and Dhalbhum, but seem to lack the alloying knowledge and definitely represent indigenous tradition not being influenced by the external forces unlike the north-western part of India. The excavations at Bahadarabad, Nasirpur and Jhinijhana, Mitathal, Ganeswar, Jodhpura, Saipai and Khatoli etc have yielded copper - hoard tools along with OCP from the same straightigrahical context which tends to suggest that both are related to each other, but necessarily an integral part of each other. Vindhyan and Ganga Valley In this region, there are two different ecological zones viz. the Vindhyan hills and Ganga Plains having different pattern of cultural developments. The Ganga plains of this region are very important in the sense that the Ganga plains were the nucleus area of second urbanization. We know that Middle Ganga valley became the epi centre of Second urbanization around 600 BCE and the effect of this urbanization reached the lower Ganga valley around 300 BCE when the area comprising both south and north 24 parganas of West Bengal</page><page sequence="9">Archaeology 925 came under sharp focus of history. Quite obviously this Ganga plains were the most favoured region of human attraction both in terms of trade, commerce, agriculture and other socio-economic reasons. The early village farming communities of this region are variously called as Neolithic,* Chalcolithic or sometime as Neo/Chalcolithic, although the term Neo-Chalcolithic is completely a misconception in the Indian archaeology (Datta and Sanyal, 2009). In the north Vindhyan region, pure Neolithic sites are found without being influenced or having any contacts whatsoever with the Chalcolithic culture of the Ganga plains. At Koldiha the Neolithic culture was succeeded by a Chalcolithic culture. The important and excavated sites are Koldiha, Mahagara and Panchoh in Belan valley of Allahabad district (Sharma et. al. 1980); Indari and Tokwa in Mirazapur district (Misra et. al 2000) of Uttar Pradesh and Kunjhun (Clark and Sharma, 1989) in Madhya Pradesh. The subsistence economy of the Neolithic people was based on exploitation of plants and animals, by domestication as well by hunting and gathering (Pal, 2009). Crops identified at Koldiha and Mahagara include rice, barley, wheat, pulses and millets, although wild variety of millet was found from Koldiha. Handmade Cord impressed, Rusticated, Burnished red and black ware have also been found (Pal and Gupta, 2004). The important and excavated Neolithic sites with BRW pottery in the Ganga Valley are Jhusi (Misra et al. 1999- 2000), Hetapatti (Pal and Gupta, 2005), Waina (Singh and Singh, 1995-96), Lahuradeva, Malhar, Raja Naia Ka Tila (Tiwari et. al 2002; 2002-03; 2004); Bhunadih (Singh and Singh, 1997-98), Sahgaura (IAR, 1974-75) Imlidih Khurd (Singh, 1993; Singh et al 2004-05) Chirand (Verma, 1971;Sinha, 1994), Chechar Kutubpur (IAR 1977-78) Taradih (IAR 1984-85), Senuwar (Singh 1990, 1997, 2004), Pandurajardhibi (Dasgupta, 1964), Bharatpur (IAR 1966- 67), Tamluk (IAR 1957-58, 1971-72), etc. The subsistence economy of this group of Neolithic cultures with BRW Pottery were based on rice, wheat, barley, lentil, green gram etc. The pottery consist of red ware, burnished red, grey, black ware, cord impressed ware, rusticated ware and black and red ware. The problem of the antiquity of the Neolithic culture of the Vindhyan is still not finally settled (Pal, 2009), although Sharma (1980) on the basis of three C14 dates placed the beginning of the Neolithic culture of this region to 7th /6th millennium B.C., but doubts were raised about such early antiquity (Pal, 2009). Because the C14 date of transitional phase of Neolithic to Chalcolithic at Koldiha is 1440+ 120 BC (as referred by J.N. Pal, 1989). Moreover the radiocarbon dates from Mahagara do not support any early date of Neolithic culture of this region. J.N. Pal (1989) while summarizing the Neolithic cultures of the Vindyan and Mid-Gangetic valley has suggested that "the C14 dates from Koldhwa assigning early date for the Vindhyan Neolithic phase are not dependable. The dates from Mahagara are not consistent to stratigraphy possibly due to contamination of samples". A revised chronology for the Vindhyan Neolithic culture was proposed to 4th millennium B.C. by Clark and Khanna (1989) on the basis of C14 dates from Kunjhun. A third revised chronology of the Vindhyan Neolithic and Middle Ganga valley early farming culture was proposed by J.N. Pal (2009) which suggest the beginning of early farming culture to 8th Millennium B.C. and the date of Vindhyan Neolithic, according to Pal should be little earlier. Naturally we</page><page sequence="10">926 I HC: Proceedings , 70th Session, 2009-10 can expect a fourth revision of early farming culture of this region in the near future. J.N. Pal (2009), on the basis of Celt types has suggested "greater antiquity of rounded Celt tradition over the Triangular Celts tradition". But there is no logic for drawing such conclusion on such typological character. Because if we go on comparing the chronology of both the Celt varieties of north-east and south India, one would find that the CI 4 dates of excavated material from north-east Indian Neolithic culture would not go beyond 2000 B.C. while the south Indian Neolithic culture can be dated to 3000 B.C. (Allchin, 2003). Naturally how we can associate the rounded Celt variety to 8lh millennium B.C context. J.N. Pal (Pal, 2009) has referred the case of hand made Court impressed pottery which according to him (2009) was basic characteristic ceramic type of Vindhyan region a long with rusticated, burnished black ware and red ware. The recent discovery of Cord impressed pottery from a number of sites in Vindhyan and middle Ganga valley in a very early context is a major breakthrough in the history of Indian ceramic technology. The C14 dates from Middle Ganga Valley especially the dates of Lohuradeva which read as 5320 90 B.P and 6290 B.P (Tiwari 2002-03) are very encouraging and throw significant light on the early farming activities of the region. But the fact is that the cord impressed pottery has been reported widely from Siberia to Japan to South-East Asia. In Japan, Joman culture associated with Cord impressed pottery is dated to 12,000 B.P Cord impressed pottery has also been reported from China, Taiwan and spirit cave of Taiwan and spirit cave of Thailand in 6th millennium context. Agrawal and Kharakawal, 2002). Considering the wide distribution of Cord impressed pottery, Agrawal and Kharakawak (2002) suggested that "its worthwhile tracing its links with the movement of early rice technology and Mon-Khmer speaking people". However despite the similarities in decoration and manufacturing technique of Cord impressed pottery between different wide regions, Pal (Pal, 2009) suggested that the Cord impressed pottery was developed in the Vindhyan region and from there it was diffused to different sites in middle Ganga valley. It implies that hand made imprussed polley originated in Vindhyan reigon. But it is very difficult to accept. The accepted view of rice cultivation in China is 12,000 years old. Recently Prof. Lee Jo of the Naitonal University of South Korea has discovered the earliest domesticated rice dating back to 15,000 years old form the excavation in the village of Sorari in chungbuk province in South Korea. Radioactive dating of 59 carbonized rice grains pushed back the date for the earliest known cultivation of this planet (Lee Jo, 2005). Pal (2009) despite his own earlier observation and remark has recently concluded that the Neolithic culture of Middle Ganga valley might have originated in the later half of 8th millennium B.C. while the date of Vindhyan Neolithic culture would be little earlier. I have great regards both for J.N. Pal and Rakesh Tewari for their contributions in the field of archaeological research. But to my mind the Mesolithic way of life was so successful in the Indian situation that the transformation from hunting/ gathering to domestication of plant and animals did not happen earlier than 3000-2500 BCE. I may be wrong. However the subsistence strategies of both the regions were based on domestication of both plants and animals together with hunting and gathering. The role of hunting /gathering subsistence in Neolithic economy</page><page sequence="11">Archaeology 927 of the Vindhyan region was more than in the Neolithic / Chalcolithic culture of the Ganga plains. This is evident by the discovery of animal remains from both the regions. The people of middle Ganga plains depended more on intensified farming activities and domesticated stock than the people of Vindhyan counterpart where life was more influenced by nomadic /pastoral activities. The technologies of these early agricultural groups were either bone/ Stone technology or Ground tool technology or Copper/ Iron technology. The ceramic industry was either Cord impressed /Basket impressed red /grey ware, burnished ware or Black and red ware. In some areas stone blade industry was strong while in some other areas it was marginal. In some sites the black and red ware culture directly gave rise to Painted grey ware culture or Black slipped ware or NBPW culture and in some other areas the Black and red ware culture gave rise directly to historical period with NBPW. Banas Culture (Rajasthan) The early village farming communities of this region primarily based on agriculture economy and copper technology found to have developed on the bank of Banas River in southern Rajasthan between 2500-1000 BCE. This indigenous culture developed despite strong influence of mature Harappan culture. Ahar is the classic site of this culture having thee phases development. Stone blade industry is almost nil while copper, copper slag and copper objects are numerous suggesting the extensive exploitation of copper mines of Aravalli range. Ahar appears to be a major copper smelting area in Rajasthan in proto- historic time. Pottery was black and red ware with white paintings along with cream slipped ware with black paintings. Besides red ware, lustrous red, grey ware with incised and appliqu√© designs occur in different phases of its occupation. Rubbing stone and saddle quern suggest the production of grains. Remains of domesticated animals like fowl, ass, buffalo, sheep, goat, pig etc. and wild species like humped cattle and deer have been found from the upper level of period I. Houses were built of stone and mud bricks while wattle and daub roofs were flat and made of bamboo and matting and covered with earth and thatch. The pattern of house building continued although the occupation (Sankalia, 1969). Another important site of this culture was Gilund located on the bank of Banas in Udaipur district of Rajasthan. It was excavated by B.B. Lai in 1959- 60 and again in 1999 by G. Possehl and Shinde of Deccan College who divided the cultural sequence into two periods. Period I is Chalcolithic with copper and stone technology. The excavator has identified four structural phases in period I with elaborate mud brick house complexes similar to Harappan and Aharian types. The house complexes are provided with all shorts of household facilities like storage jar, hearth, platform and circular pits etc. There were large and small structural remains. Black and red ware with white painting like Ahar remains the basic ceramic type throughout and only in the upper level cream slipped ware appeared. But unlike Ahar stone blade industry was an essential element of culture. In the lower level there was no foreign</page><page sequence="12">928 I HC: Proceedings , 70th Session, 2009-10 influence, but in the upper level traces of foreign elements are found. Copper object specially bowl with channel spout from khurdi in Rajasthan recall similar finds from Giyan I and Silk in Iran. But the most interesting discovery of recent excavation was the recovery of more than 100 seals from a bin parallel with central and Middle East Asian countries. According to its excavators Gilund maintained a long distance trade relation and well connected with other regions inside and outside Gilund. According to Allchin (2003) this group of Ahar culture actually checked the eastern movement of Harappan advance. Another important site of this region is Balathal excavated by V.N. Misra (2007). The Chalcolithic site of Balathal ranges in time from 3000-1500 BCE and spread over 5 acres of land with average cultural deposit of 7 m. The major ceramic type was black and red ware with white paintings. Besides red incised ware, red slipped buff ware, reserved slip, and grey etc. ware also found from excavation. Potteries were both handmade and wheel made. Architectural activities are divided into two parts viz. fortified enclosure and residential complexes of multi-storied rectangular or squarish mud brick and stone structures. Balathal is an important semi-urban town and its plans are similar to Harappan sites in Gujarat, Rajdi, Kuntasi and Dholavira (Misra, 2007). Only in period IIIC has yielded Malwa pottery. Malwa Culture East of Banas and Aravalli range lies the fertile Malwa plateau drained by Chambal and Narmada rivers. Kayatha and Navdatoli are two important sites in the region. Kayatha has revealed a three fold cultural sequence starting from 2400 BCE- 1500 BCE (Ansari and Dhavlikar, 1975) Period I has produced the most three distinctive Kayatha pottery. They are painted in violet over a band of deep brown slip, buff painted ware and combed ware .85% of the Kayatha pottery is hand made and only 15% are wheel rfiade. Copper objects of flat axe and rings are similar to Ahar. Stone blade industry on Chalcedony and other stones is rich unlike the Banas culture. Period II is basically a continuation of period I except changes in pottery style. Houses were made of wattle and daub. Terracotta figures of bulls are special feature of this period. Period III (1800-1500 BCE) shows the beginning of distinctive pottery style known as Malwa ware. Wheat was possibly cultivated in the region. The Chalcolithic occupation of this region is known as Maheswar- Navdatoli. There are several mounds having occupation at different levels. The whole sequence has been divided into seven cultural periods, of which period III represent Chalcolithic occupation of the area. Period III is again sub-divided into four phases with intermittent breaks. Navdatoli has been dated to 2020-1600 BCE. The site was excavated by Sankalia and others from 1952-53 and again in 1957-59 (Sankalia et. al, 1971). Stone bl√°de industry comprising backed blades and geometric forms together with copper technology are the basic character of period I at Navdatoli. Phase I of period III at Navdatoli is characterized by Painted black and red, cream slipped and Malwa ware while in phase II painted black and red disappeared. There are</page><page sequence="13">Archaeology 929 evidences of fire at the end of this phase. Phase III is marked by disappearance of cream slipped ware and appearance of black on red together with Jorwe and few lustrous red ware. Finally Phase IV is marked by Jorwe, lustrous red and ware. Circular or rectangular houses with roofs supported by split bamboo plastered with mud were provided with hearths and open Chullas. There was no evidence of fortification of the settlement like Nagda and Eran. Animal remains of domesticated species like cattle, sheep and goat and wild species like deer have been found from excavation. The evidence of two varieties of wheat, rice and fruits and oil seeds etc have also been found suggesting the basic structure of subsistence economy. Excavation has also revealed the existence of granary. Painted black and red ware, red slipped ware with black paintings etc are closely related with Malwa culture. Besides, grey ware similar to pottery of Maharastra and Karnataka has been found all through. Metallographic analysis shows that low tin bronze were used by the people. In terms of variety of designs and frequency of painted sherds Navdatoli seems to represent the classic Chalcoltihic site in India. The settlement was frequently affected by fire and flood. Copper objects found from Phase IV indicate further cultural contacts with distant lands. Recent research by Gulam Raza of Iran on pottery from Sialk and Navdatoli shows similarities in pottery designs especially of sun symbol which led him to conclude the Aryan migration from Iran to Navdatoli during the middle of 2nd millennium BCE. Banas and Malwa seem to represent independent cultures not being influenced by Mature Harappan culture. The distinctive characters of style and form of these cultures developed at a point of time when mature Haranpan civilization was trying to push its influences in eastern direction. But it is needless to say that there were actions and counteraction between them. Further south of this region is Deccan plateau which acted as a contact zone between the north and south. Since this was a buffer zone between the north and south, this region witnessed intensive cross migration of people, trade and culture reflecting a synthesis of different forms. Deccan Chalcolithic Culture The Chalcolithic life style of Maharashtra can be drawn on the basis of excavated materials from Inamgaon, Nevasa, Diamabad, Chandali etc. which show similarities in material culture with Malawa. The classic site of this region is Inamgaon, excavated by Deccan College from 1968-1974 (Sankalia et al., 1971). The cultural sequence of Inamgaon has been divided into three phases. The lower level or phase I is known as Malwa Phase (1600-1400 BCE). During this phase, houses were either rectangular with wooden frame or made of wattle and daub or circular with shallow pits accompanying post holes around the pit. Evidences of wheat, barley, field peas, lentil, horse gram etc have been found while the animal remains comprise both wild and domesticated cattle, goat, sheep and pig etc. Black and red painted pottery along with handmade red and grey ware have been found from phase I. It appears that the economy of the people was based on agriculture and hunting/ pastoral mode. Phase II (1400-1000 BCE) at Inamgaon is known as early</page><page sequence="14">930 I HC: Proceedings, 70th Session, 2009-10 Jorwe culture when (around 1400 BCE) Jorwe people arrived at the site and occupied it. They adopted the previous house plan. This phase is the most prosperous period of Inamgaon as there was substantial increaser of settlement areas. During this time houses were built with well laid out plan. The floors of the houses were carefully built and plastered with mud, sand and lime and in some cases there are evidences of repair. There was provision of granary for storing food stuff. The evidence of embankment suggests that people were conscious about the flood. The evidence of potters' kilns has also been found. Pottery was coarse grey ware and painted red Jorwa ware. A distinct Stone blade industry was found, but copper technology played a much greater role in economy as the copper tool types include flat axe, chisel, copper spearhead with mid-rib and Antennae hilt and fish hook etc suggesting outside contacts. The burial system of this phase was elaborate as double urn burial for infant and children are found inside the house complexes besides multiple urn burials. The economy was based on farming-hunting and fishing. Phase III (1000- 700 BCE) at Inamgaon is known as late Jorwe. This phase shows sign of disintegration as settlement size has been drastically reduced. Small round this huts appeared against large rectangular house complexes of the previous phase. Pottery became coarse, and according to its excavator this phase shows total cultural degeneration. The reason for such condition has been ascribed to climate change leading to more aridity which fi nally forced the people to abandon the settlement around 700 BCE. South Indian Neolithic Culture In South India around 3000 BCE, Neolithic culture developed near granite hills, hill slope and rock-shelter. Neolihtic culture was followed by Megalithic culture around 1200 BCE in south India (Rao, 1972, Narsimahaih, 1980). The process of development of Neolithic culture can be traced in two phases (Thaper, 1992; Agrawal, 1982). Phase I of Neolithic culture is characterized by a distinct stone blade industry comprising non-geometric tools. The ground tool industry comprises Celts. Adzes, Chisels, Hammers, Pounders etc. Celts are generally triangular in shape with rounded butt and oval cross-section. Pottery was hand made coarse pale red, grey, brown, buff and burnished grey with appliqu√© designs. The presence of applied ring feet and hollow pedestal remarkably resemble to pre-Harappan Amri and Kalibangan and Neolithic pottery of Burzaham. The pottery shapes include shallow dish, channel spouted bowl, Handled cup. Footed cup, Narrow necked jar, Dish on stand and perforated pots etc. The evidences of cattle pen, hoof marks and stockade (upright stick), post-holes, ashes etc from Utnur represent the pure Neolithic cattle breeding economy with incipient agriculture. In Phase II, there was a basic change in the material culture. Circular huts with low mud plinth fortified by split bamboo screen and conical thatch roof became the house pattern of phase II. Pottery became wheel made and comprises dull red with black and violates painting, black and red ware and burnished grey ware. At Tekkalakotta black and red and black ware were used as grave goods. The shapes include spouted bowl, vessel, high necked jar; oval shaped lamps, spouted lota and channel spouted bowl etc. The shapes are similar with Jorwa culture pottery.</page><page sequence="15">Archaeology 93 1 Gold and other metal objects have been reported from Tekkalakota II, Maski, Sangankallu (Ansari and Rao, 1969); Piklihal (Allchin, 1961), Brahmagiri (Wheeler, 1948); Hallur etc also suggest foreign intrusion through exchange. Besides beads of agate. Chalcedony, Carnelian and Jasper etc. have been found. Burials were either extended inhumation or pot burial, but the introduction of more than one pot suggests contact with Deccan Chalcolithic (Jorwe) culture. Paintings and bruising is other interesting feature of South Indian Neolithic culture. Remains of domesticated cattle, Buffalo, Sheep and Goat and wild species of Spotted Deer, Nilgai, Rat, Horse and Lizard etc have been found. The plant remains include Millet and horse grammas wild species. It appears that the economy of South Indian Neolithic culture was based on Agro-Pastoral and hunting -gathering mode of subsistence. Problem related to Indo-Aryan Migration The cultural development of Post-Harappan period (2000-1 100BCE) is marked by many regional cultures and the mode of adaptation was different in different regions depending upon the specific regional geographical factors. The basic economy was agriculture i.e. either wheat or rice, but in most of the cases agriculture alone could not support the total subsistence problem. As we have seen that from north to south, the agricultural subsistence was supplemented either by pastoral or hunting/ gathering economy. As a matter of fact, the copper/ Bronze technology of the period concern failed to yield surplus production which may further support trade to generate wealth for any major changes in the basic structure of economy like Indus civilization, although there was sporadic contacts with cultures of outside India specially the Middle East. As a result, most of the settlement structures were either mud houses made of wattle and daub or mud and mud brick structures. No use of burnt bricks was noticed during this period. Few exceptions are noticed in sites like Gilund, Balathal, Navdatoli, Ahar etc. where multi-houses were made of mud and stones and in some cases there were also fortifications or enclosures (Balathal) with granaries. This type of Chalcolithic settlement sites can be designated as semi-urban centres, but never urban city. It appears therefore that the phase I of post-Harappan cultural development in India is marked by basically early village farming communities having Copper /Bronze as major technology. There were also few Chalcolithic settlements not influenced by the Harappan culture attained the status of Semi-urban character. But nevertheless the people of this period had to depend on more than one form of subsistence. The next question which is very much relevant in this period is the Indo-Aryan migration. This is a very complicated problem of Indian Archaeology, and naturally I do not consider myself competent to discuss it however, as an archaeologists have identified the following cultures which can be connected with the Aryan migration/ association: (a) Gandhara Grave Culture (1500-500 BCE) (b) Copper-hoard Culture (2650-1180 BCE) (c) Cemetery H Culture (1900-1300 BCE) The Aryans are supported to be associated with Horse, Fire, Rice and cremation of dead bodies. Among the above traits, disposal of dead can be considered</page><page sequence="16">932 IHC: Proceedings , 70th Session, 2009-10 as rigid and reflets the socio-religious character. We shall discuss the disposal methods of the above three cultures to find out to what extent they can be related to the "Aryan" myths or reality. The Harappan civilization had a distinct burial custom through out its territory (Sarkar, 1937). Sarkar while making observation about the burial customs of the Indus civilization wrote "So much of human feelings are associated with it that no man except in case of exigency would be prepared to change the traditional funerary ceremony". In view of the above statement by Sarkar (1937, 1965). We can say that the custom was both stable and unstable - unstable in an unorganized tribe society, but stable in an organized society which is sufficiently regulated by religion. In such organized society the disposal methods are more or less completely governed by religion whose basic features and frame work remain static, the modes of disposal of the dead automatically remain stable. The skull and the spinal borne are often found charred and not completely reduced to ashes. The survivors of the dead often take care of the partially burnt bones out of regards, and put them in pots or pots kept in pits. The evidence of cremation in Cemetery H Culture as well subsequent collection of charred bones in some cases and put it in painted pots in graves is indicative of a group of people whether Aryan or some other ethnic group whose disposal method was definitely quite different from the Harappan. It is very difficult to associate them directly with the Aryans, but there are reasons to believe that they had a distinct disposal method of cremation. On the basis of disposal method which is very rigid and controlled by religion in an organized society, we can conclude that the Cemetery H people are not the descendents of Harappan people. In fact, there was no genetical relationship between Harappa and Cemetery H people. They are totally migrant people with distinct social customs quite different from the Harappans. However, Kenoyer (2001:190) observed in this matter that "may only reflect a change in the focus of settlement organization from the pattern of earlier Harapan phase and not cultural discontinuity, urban decay, invading aliens or site abandonment, all of which have been earlier suggested." Despite the rejection of Aryan theory by Kenoyar (1994;2001), Jim Shaffer (2001) and many other western scholars, I would like to emphasize and believe that there were definite migration of people with distinct disposal custom which may or not be associated with the so called "Aryan". The Cemetery H Culture of Punjab was extended towards the east. The basic house structure was mud brick and rice was staple food while the Black on red slipped paintings like Antelope, Deer and sun or moon etc. are very significant. The disposal method of Gandhara grave culture reflects both cremation and inhumation suggesting the presence of more than one group of people with different disposal methods. They may represent immigrant along side indigenous people. But in respect of Copper-Hoard culture, we do not have much information. SO they may be discarded from the discussion. On the basis of disposal methods of Cemetery H culture, Gandhara Grave Culture are copper-hoard Culture, we can conclude that both at Gandhara and Cemetery H some new immigrant people with a definite cremation practice were present there. Whether they represent Aryan some other people need to be investigated with more data.</page><page sequence="17">Archaeology 933 Second Phase of Cultural Development (Iron Age Cultures, 1000 -600 BCE) Unlike the previous phase I, the pattern of development in phase II is basically characterized by iron technology, making a major breakthrough in the history of technology in India. During this time the iron using cultures in India were a) the Pirak culture (phase III) of south eastern Baluchistan; (b) Gandhara grave culture (phase III) of Swat valley; (c) Painted grey ware culture of Indo-Gangetic divide and doab region; (d) BRW Culture of Central India (e) BRW culture of eastern India including Orissa; (0 South Indian Megalithic culture. This phase (ranging from 1000 -600 BCE) of the Indian History is the most crucial phase since it initiated the historical process and subsequently urbanization in the middle Ganga Valley. Pirak phase II and Gandhara Grave Culture III Pirak is an important site in eastern Baluchistan having extensive contact with sites of Iranian plateau. Phase III of pirak is marked by further development of iron technology initiated in the upper level of phase II. It witnessed maximum development in material culture, but Pirak does not represent a culture, it is an individual site which around 800 BCE ceased to exist due to reason not clear to Archaeologists. During the same period of time, Gandhara grave Culture continued to evolve with its higher form of iron technology and finally laid the foundation for historical growth in that region (Taxila, Charsada) around 500 BCE. Painted grey Ware (PGW) Culture Painted grey ware culture is found to be distribute in Indo-gangetic divide and upper Ganga valley. The pottery was made of well levigated clay on wheel in grey colour with thin section and painted with black or red in geometric pattern. The major shapes are dish, bowl and vase etc. The pots were fired under reducing firing technique. Only 10%of the total ceramic assemblage of PGW site is painted grey ware. It is often described as deluxe pottery. Tripathy ( 1 976) has reported 3 1 5 PGW sites. Painted grey ware culture was a village culture. The subsistence economy was based on agriculture and pastoralism. There was no urban centre, no such town planning, no trade and commerce, no coinage or writings etc. The houses were modest made of wattle and daub or mud and mud bricks. Settlement size was also moderate. Evidences of rice, horses, cattle, buffalo and pig and sheep along with species of Deer and antler etc. were found from excavation. Charred animal bones indicated inclusion of both domesticated and wild animal meat in the dietary system. At some sites like Bhagwanpura, Roper, Ganganagar etc. iron is absent while at some other sites like Hastinapur, Atranjikhera in western UP and Noh and Jodhpur in eastern Rajasthan iron is present with copper. The agro- pastoral culture of PGW was distinguished by the use of iron, horse and cattle and a thin grey coloured and painted pottery. It spread from the Sutlej to Ganga particularly along the banks of Saraswati river valley. They discovery</page><page sequence="18">934 IHC: Proceedings , 70th Session , 2009-10 of PGW from Hastinapur, Panipat, Kurukshetra, Mathura and Indraprasta etc. has led s√≤me scholars to associate it with Mahabharata period. However, according to Suraj Bhan, the geographical distribution, chronology and the cultural milieu of the PGW culture can be well compared with the culture of the latter Vedic period or Aryan (Suraj Bhan, 1976). Megalithic Culture of South India The culture is dominated by burnished unpainted black and red ware, red and black ware. Iron is found both from graves and habitational areas. Copper/ Bronze/ Gold also occurs frequently while stone blade and ground tool industry of the previous culture show sharp decline. Major concentration of this culture is found in Karnataka, Andhra and Tamilnadu with its northern extension near Nagpur (Misra, 1972) while its southern extension is found from the extreme south as well coastal Sri-Lanka. V.D. Krishnaswami (1942) explored the Chingelput district in 1942 and discovered more than 200 megalithic sites and many of them were latter excavated. The important sites are Brahmagiri, Hallur, Arikamedu, Piklihal, Sanganakallu, Payampalli, Maski, Adichanallur, Raigir etc. The important iron objects associated with the Megalithic culture are axe, shaft hole axe, tanged axe, hoe, pickaxe, sickle, iron wedge, crowbars, spears, chisel knives, adzes, iron tripods or pot rest, Saucer with lamps etc. for domestic use while dagger, sword, arrowhead, spearhead with hollow socket etc for military purpose. From Junapani, kheepa and Naikund etc. horse furniture consisting of iron shuffle bits and in one more case bit was found form the mouth of a buried horse. Major megalithic types are urn burial, cist burial, pit burial, menhir, sarcophagi and rock cut caves etc. Payampalli in Arcot district of Tamilnadu was excavated by S.R. Rao of ASI in 1964-65 who brought to light clear cut evidence of overlapping between Neolithic and Megalithic cultures suggesting genetically no relationship between the two. Agriculture and cattle rearing supplemented by hunting was the manor economy. Rice was cultivated along with toehr grains of cereals, pulses. For storing water the megalithic builders constructed artificial dam to cultivate land and to produce two crops. Animal remains of cattle, sheep, Deer, Pig, foul, jungle cat, rhino etc have been found from excavation at Payampalli. We still do not know who were the megalithic people? Did they represent an immigrant group or local indigenous people? In view of similar monuments found from many places around the word - from Ireland, Malta, West Asia, Japan, Baluchistan, South-east Asia including Indonesia, it is not unlikely that they represent a single group of people who in course of their wondering diffused to different parts of the world. They may represent the Celtic people, the Scythian or Atlanteans or even the Aryans or indigenous people. We do not know still now who they are. Ramchandra (1979) has suggested the possibility of Aryan connection on the ground of iron and horse. But the question still remains largely unanswered. The megalithic culture of South India represents a progressive culture especially in terms of variety of iron objects. But still they could not manipulate the technology to the benefit of progressive cultural change through economic growth, and as such the culture remained stagnant before it ceased to exist around 2nd Century CE. They were</page><page sequence="19">Archaeology 935 possibly warrior like indigenous or immigrant tribal people. They can not be associated with the Aryans who were more intelligent and were capable enough to bring about changes in social and economic structures for further development. BRW Culture of Central India There are two important sites under this category viz. Eran and Nagda, both in central India and both were fortified sites. Eran is located on the bank of Bina in Sagar dist. and was excavated by K.D. Bajpai from 1960-65 who divided the cultural sequence of Eran into the three broad periods viz. Period I (2100-700 BCE) is Chalcolithic with two sub-periods as early Chalcolithic and late chalcolithic followed by period II which is Iron age with similar two sub-phases as IIA and IIB and finally period III which is Historical period. Period IIA (700-200 BCE) is Iron age culture with usual black and red ware as the diagnostic pottery of the sub period along with profuse iron objects and few NBP sherds besides terracotta animal and human figures and tribal and punched mark coins and one circular lead with seal mark of Indragupta written in Brahmi character of 3rd century CE and Beads of stone, shell, terracotta, copper along with bone points and shell bangle etc have been found from excavation (Bajpai, 1964). In Period IIB (200 BCE -100 CE) the black and red ware totally disappear and replaced by plain red ware with common bowl type with incurved rim along with shell bangle, bone point, terracotta animal and human figure and evidences of structures in the form of burnt bricks together with a hoards of coins etc have been found (Bajpai, 1964), while iron continued to dominate the metal technology. Period III is a Historical. There was no gap between the two sub-phases of period II and between periods II and III indicating how the iron technology helped the chalcolithic people to evolve into a higher form of culture through a transitional period at Eran and Nagda, a similar sequence was observed at Mangalkot in West-Bengal (Ray 1991, Datta, '99S). But despite a strong iron technology the process of historical growth did not happen to occur till 1st century CE at Eran and Nagda and 3rd century BCE at Mangalkot. The reason is not clear. As such the Culture lingered through time till the impact from middle Ganga valley reached there. The next important site in this region is Nagda located on Chambal River in Ujjain dist. The site was excavated by N.R. Banerjee of ASI from 1955-56 who divided the 9.75 M occupational deposit into three broad periods. Period I is Chalcolithic being characterized by Black and red ware and massive mud and mud brick structures of residential nature. Evidence of Rampart and bastion suggest that Nagda was well fortified site. Black painted red ware and red or cream with red paintings consisting of sun, Antelope, Deer, Peacock etc have been found together with stone blade tools, copper, sling ball, pounder etc. But the typical Navdatoli and Jorwe pottery are absent. Period II of Nagda is Pre-NBP marked by iron objects. Black and red ware black slipped ware were the dominant ceramic types of period II. Iron objects consist of Tanged and non-tanged arrowheads, spearheads, dagger, axe, socketed axe, knife</page><page sequence="20">936 IHC: Proceedings, 70th Session, 2009-10 blade, Celts, Sickle, Spoon, nails. Rings etc. Period III is NBP culture (500- 200 BCE). It is further marked by substantial increase of iron objects which include Knives including curved variety, Chisels, Sickles, Curved blades, arrowheads of square or rectangular with hexagonal cross-section, Double edged daggers, hoes, Chisel, nails, bowls etc. in the post Chalcolithic Malwa culture, both Nagda and Eran (both fortified sites) are important sites in Central India documenting the nature of transformation of village culture into urban or semi-urban culture and it also demonstrated the impact of iron technology on material culture. The evidence of iron at Nagda shows the perfection of technology which is even better than Eran. Both the sites evolved into historical period through a short transitional phase. Despite a strong iron technology, the historical process did not happen before 1st century CE. Nagda had almost similar sequence with Eran and Mangalkot. BRW Culture of Eastern India In this region of eastern India comprising Bihar, West Bengal including Orissa, the BRW culture (Black and red ware Culture) in some sites were preceded by a pure Chalcolithic culture while in some other sites, the BRW settlement started without any antecedent stage. When iron occurred as principal metal technology in association with black and red ware ceramics, we call it as BRW culture. In most of the cases, copper played very insignificant role but its application was restricted to few domestic items while iron became the principal technology. The important sites are Chirand Period II (Verma, 1971) Taradih Period II (IAR 1973-74), Pandurajardhibi period II (Dasgupta) Tamluk period II (IAR 1971-72); Bharatpur period II (IAR 1965-66) and Mangalkot (Ray and Mukherjee, 1993; Ray, 1991; Datta, 1991); Dihar (Pal, 1993), Pakhanna (Datta, 2008) Mahisdal (IAR 1966-67) etc. The principal ceramic types were black and red ware, Red ware, Black ware, cream slipped ware, Chocolate ware etc. with either black or white paintings. Blade tool industry was marginal, but bone tool industry was exceptionally rich as in case of Tamluk and Pandurajardhibi. Iron technology was exceptionally rich and developed. The process of iron making technology can be divided in to two stages. In the 1st iron was smelted through direct reduction method in open furnace using charcoal as fuel and in the 2nd stage the bloom or ingot was collected and transformed into finished products by heating, forging and quenching methods. The discovery of iron sickle, axe, dagger, chisel, sword blade, peg, nail, rod, disc, spearhead, arrowhead and large quantities of unidentified objects from different Stratums of excavated sites of eastern India strongly suggest the technical knowledge of iron technology from 1000 BCE. The iron technology of the BRW culture of eastern India especially of West- Bengal was quite good enough to boost the economy and laid the foundation for second urbanization in lower Bengal around 300 BCE. The material culture of Pandurajardhibi, Mangalkot, Basantpur, Tamluk, Baneswardanga etc. reflect the nature of change during this phase that one can expect from a strong agrarian based economy. The transition from Black and red ware culture to historical period (Datta, 1995) has been clearly demonstrated in the excavation of Mangalkot (Period II, transitional). The subsistence economy of Black</page><page sequence="21">Archaeology 937 and red ware people was basically Agro pastoral economy supported by partial hunting /gathering. But still the historical process of transforming the society did not happen earlier than 3rd century BCE. The impetus came from north India. Conclusion By about 1100 BCE iron technology was introduced in different regional cultures like PGW culture (1100 BCE), Gandhara grave culture (1500-500 BCE), BRW culture (1100-600), Megalithic culture (1 100-200 CE). In phase I, we have seen how the Copper/ Bronze technology helped to usher a semi- urban settlement network in Chalcolithic culture of Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Deccan etc. but failed to boost the economy to the extent of making pure urban centres /cities and finally disappeared on the face of a new wave of cultural tradition coming from north-west India with a strong iron technology around 1100 BCE. It appears, therefore, from the review of cultural development in the second phase that among the iron using different regional cultures the most important was the PGW culture which flourished in north India specially the Indo-gangetic divide and the doab region around 1100 BCE. The culture is often associated with the second phase of Aryan migration or often the PGW period is called as later Vedic period. The PGW culture is a village culture based on agro-pastoral economy and characterized by the use of Iron, Horse, Cattle, and Rice. But the most conspicuous thing about them is the disposal method which in all probability was cremation, a practice very much associated with the Aryans. During this time agriculture was intensified with the help of a strong iron technology. According to Suraj Bhan, "the semi-agricultural and pastoral Aryans of the Rig- Veda had by now taken to settled Janapadas and developed agrarian economy assisted by relevant iron technology and social organization comprising Varna system. It is during this time that Gana Rajyas (tribal republics) or chiefdoms came into existence".... I fully agree with Prof. Bhan that the social and economic process initiated in the region around 1100 BCE with the development of PGW culture finally led to the emergence of different political powers with city states or what is known as Mahajanapadas in 6th century BCE and it is believed by many of the later Vedic texts were written during this time, but I do not agree with the argument that they were Aryans. Because the term Aryan is controversial and often denotes a linguistic connotation. But what appears from the archaeological records suggest that there were two wave of migration of people with distinct cremation methods as social customs. These migrations took place during the time of Cemetery H culture and painted grey ware culture. Whether they can be called as Aryan or some other ethnic groups is yet to be settled through more positive archaeological data. What appears to me from the archaeological data this region was vibrant with different human activities right from 1100 BCE with the arrival of a new culture that finally replaced in some cases like Bhagwanpura, Manda, Dhedheri Nagar etc the earlier cemetery H people and in some other cases replaced the earlier BRW culture. They are called Painted grey ware culture. Consequently the Indo- Gangetic divide and the upper Ganga valley became the pivotal centre of</page><page sequence="22">938 I HC: Proceedings , 70th Session , 2009-10 human activities which finally led to the emergence of second urbanization and became a centre of focus of political activities in India. Before I conclude my lecture 1 would i i ke to make some personal observations regarding the present state of affairs of Indian archaeological scenario. This is exclusively my personal comments and it has nothing to do with my institution to which 1 belong. India is a unique country being characterized by diverse landscape, environment, people, language and culture. This diversity is reflected in the expression of regional culture, but when we talk about the Indian culture, these diverse elements acted as centripetal forces in the making of the Indian culture which reflects its unique character. Naturally we do not require any extrapolation of archaeological data to glorify India's past. In recent years while making a retrospect of the Indian archaeological research, I have noticed that there has been persistent change in the perception of looking into the History of India's past through archaeological data. I do not have any difficulties in understanding the underlying perceptions of the leftist and the rightist in their approach to view the development of the Indian History. Because their views are well known for long back. But what gives me much difficulty in understanding the view points of the new emerging school of thoughts and their way of interpretations of archaeological data for the reconstruction of the Indian History. One such group is Pseudo nationalist archaeologists who are more concerned to advance their own career/ image than real national cause. By making some loose comments over colonial legacy among the Indian archaeologists and personal attacks, one can not become a nationalistic archaeologist. There is another group of scholars who are more interested in western theories than the real Indian history. These scholars are inclined to view the development of Indian history/ culture through western theories /models. My humble request to them that a theory developed on factual data in a given environment /circumstance of a region can not operate in a wider geographical area.
