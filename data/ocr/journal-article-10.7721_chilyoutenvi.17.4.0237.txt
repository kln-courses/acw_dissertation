Abstract   Youth can benefit from opportunities to learn about both local and global socio- ecological systems. Programs such as Garden Mosaics that focus on local cultures  and places and that include opportunities for global understanding, may foster such  learning across cultural and national boundaries. Garden Mosaics is a U.S.-based  youth and community program that incorporates youth participation and engages  young people in learning from elders, many of whom are immigrants, about  growing food in urban gardens. In 2005, we adapted the Garden Mosaics activities  for learners in two South African township schools, and we have used what we  learned in South Africa to enhance our U.S. youth programs. However, our  experience also raises critical issues about the reciprocity of our efforts, and about  how we can form more equitable cross-national partnerships in the future to create  youth programs that integrate local and global understanding.

However, in today’s world  where cultural, economic, and ecological systems are inextricably linked, programs  need to balance youth developing a “sense of (local) place” with developing an  understanding of global cultures and environments (Li 2003; Thomashow 2002).  Similarly, educators need to ground their work in local knowledge and instructional  techniques while also collaborating with others in the international community who  are working toward the same environmental goals. Effectively responding to today’s  complex environmental problems may require sharing and learning across national  borders by both learners and educators. To explore and document some of the  challenges encountered when adapting a program to a new culture, we piloted a  U.S.-based informal science education program with local and global components in  South Africa. Through this process we sought to understand whether certain  program characteristics make a curriculum relevant in multiple settings and,  therefore, particularly appropriate for sharing across cultures.    Our research focused on Garden Mosaics (www.gardenmosaics.org), a science  education program that engages youth in participatory learning and action  alongside elder gardeners in cities in the U.S. We hypothesized that Garden Mosaics  would be appropriate for implementation in countries other than the U.S. because it  incorporates the following attributes:    1. Designed for use with multicultural and multi-lingual populations  2. Incorporates intergenerational learning  3. Draws on local and scientific knowledge  4. Focuses on a universally-relevant issue, i.e., sustainable food production,  and actively engages youth in addressing this issue through conducting a  local action project  5. Designed to be used in a variety of settings with the educators selecting  and adapting activities appropriate for their audiences    As we implemented the Garden Mosaics activities in collaboration with an  educational non-governmental organization in Durban, South Africa, we began to  see that the issues underlying each of these hypotheses were indeed linked to our  possible success. However, the situation we encountered in township schools in  South Africa presented unexpected challenges and led us to reflect on the complex  nature of cross-national and cross-cultural program adaptation. In this paper, we  briefly review the literature on environmental science education programs  integrating local and global perspectives, describe Garden Mosaics in the U.S. and  in South Africa, and then discuss our mixed success at piloting Garden Mosaics in  South Africa. Finally, we reexamine our original assumptions and present our  reflections on the impact of our activities on youth, educators, and gardeners in  South Africa, and on our educational initiatives in the U.S.         </page> <page sequence="3"> Sharing Programs across Cultures: Lessons from Garden Mosaics in South Africa 239  Bridging the Local and Global through Environmental and Science  Education Programs  Educators working in developing countries have expressed concern about the focus  of programs that are developed in the West and imposed in developing countries  (Gray 1999; Waldrip and Taylor 1999). They cite a possible disconnect between the  curriculum and students’ worldviews (e.g., when students who come from  “anthropomorphic” cultures try to gain an understanding of “causal” world views),  and between pedagogy and social norms (e.g., students who have been raised in a  hierarchical society may not feel comfortable with posing questions) (Gray 1999).  Other problems include lack of resources for hands-on and technology-based  instruction, lack of commitment of the “donor” or “implementer/intervener” to  understanding local culture and to developing support structures to sustain the  intervention, difficulties related to vocabulary and concepts when students are  learning in a second language, and the lack of relevance of lessons and learning  support materials (Aikenhead 2006; Burniske 2003; Gray 1999). Waldrip and  Taylor (1999) also note that teaching students in developing countries Western  ways of doing science at times may be detrimental to children and village life  because it devalues traditional ways of thinking and practice. As a result of these  challenges, efforts to adapt programs to other cultures sometimes fail, as when  Canadian First Nations educators working with Project WILD decided to develop  their own environmental education program instead (Aikenhead 2006).    However, in a case study that exemplifies the danger of making generalizations  about the “globalization” of curricula, Zembylas (2002) describes how imposing  Western, inquiry-based, science education led to greater place-based learning in  Cyprus. At the time inquiry-based approaches were imposed, educators were using  more traditional, content-driven curricula coming from Greece and England.  Although initially educators were not favorable to the imposition of yet another  curriculum from outside “colonizers,” they found that because inquiry education  required students to conduct investigations in their local environments, the result  was locally-situated learning. Zembylas (2002) goes on to claim that science  curricula focusing on performance can integrate nature studies, traditional  ecological knowledge, and Western science, and create spaces in which the local  and global can be performed together.     Several well-known programs begin with place-based or local activities, and use  those as a foundation for youth to develop an understanding of people and of the  cultural, political, economic, and environmental forces that connect people and  places on a global scale (Furman and Gruenewald 2004; Thomashow 2002). For  example, monitoring local populations of migratory birds or butterflies allows youth  to engage in place-based learning while connecting to individuals conducting similar  work in other countries through the Internet, and to develop an understanding of  global threats to biodiversity (e.g., the Journey North  http://www.learner.org/jnorth/ and Bird Trek projects  http://sciq.ca/birdtrek_america.html). The Global Learning and Observations to  Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program, which originated in the U.S. and is now  being conducted in 109 countries around the world, is designed to share scientific  resources and knowledge across national borders, providing both educational    </page> <page sequence="4"> Sharing Programs across Cultures: Lessons from Garden Mosaics in South Africa 240  experiences and scientific data (http://www.globe.gov). In our own work with  Garden Mosaics, students in Russia and the U.S. used a blog to share their local  activities and to learn about each other’s interests and communities  (http://www.gm-baltimore-tomsk.blogspot.com/).     Programs that incorporate the knowledge of immigrants and other displaced  persons also challenge us to think in new ways about the global/local duality. For  example, in the Garden Mosaics program in the U.S., urban youth interview  immigrant gardeners about their plant-based knowledge and about how such  knowledge relates to their cultural traditions. Through situating their activities in  culturally diverse, urban, community garden settings, the youth learn about other  countries and cultures but in a local setting. At the same time, the program  includes “Western” science resources to help youth further their understanding of  what they learn from the gardeners. In this way, the youth apply what is often seen  as universal (Western) knowledge lacking context to local learning (albeit local  learning that incorporates global elements via immigrant elders). Garden Mosaics  thus provides an example of how it has become increasingly difficult to separate the  local from the global in a world where globalization not only means a global  economy, but also increasing movement of people and environmental problems  across national boundaries (Li 2003). The term “glocal” has been used to describe  programs that attempt to bridge global or universal education and local or place- based education (Haynes 2005).     In short, addressing the local/global duality in today’s multicultural society is not as  simple as “think global/act local,” or even as Gough (2002) suggests, thinking and  learning locally but acting on the global level to solve problems that cross national  borders. Instead, both the global and local are intertwined and pervade multiple  levels of learning and acting.    Garden Mosaics Youth Activities    Garden Mosaics is a youth and community science education program funded by  the U.S. National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Agriculture that  seeks to “connect youth and elders to investigate the mosaics of plants, people,  and cultures in gardens” (Krasny et al. 2005). The learning activities take place  largely in urban community gardens, although other settings such as school and  home gardens are possible. Youth participants in Garden Mosaics come from after- school, community center, environmental education, 4-H, and similar programs,  and from school classrooms. Originally developed at Cornell University, Garden  Mosaics is now the youth program of the American Community Gardening  Association.    The Garden Mosaics activities include four “i⋅m⋅science investigations” that  incorporate learning from elders in the community, from observations, and from  science resources developed at Cornell University. The four investigations are  Neighborhood Exploration, in which youth explore the assets of their community  using spatial images, observations, and interviews while walking around their  neighborhood; Gardener Story, which entails interviewing a gardener about the  connections of planting practices to cultural traditions; Community Garden    </page> <page sequence="5"> Sharing Programs across Cultures: Lessons from Garden Mosaics in South Africa 241  Inventory, in which participants list the activities and other assets community  gardens provide for their neighborhood; and Weed Watch, designed to collect data  about weed problems and control methods in urban gardens. Participants can share  the results of any of these investigations using forms on the Garden Mosaics  website, and visitors to the website can view the results of other investigations.  During their i⋅m⋅science investigations, youth are gathering information from  gardeners and other community members that they use to plan an Action Project,  which can vary from building an accessible raised planter to sharing their  knowledge with younger children. Through these activities, Garden Mosaics  integrates science learning, intergenerational mentoring, cultural understanding,  and community action. The program also offers numerous free (online) and for-sale  resources, including 40 illustrated Science Pages, a 250-page program manual, a  training DVD for educators, and an interactive DVD designed to engage youth in  exploring global agricultural biodiversity.     Garden Mosaics Activities in South Africa   During fall 2004, Garden Mosaics leaders Keith Tidball and Marianne Krasny realized  the potential for expanding our understanding of how to conduct multi-cultural,  community education programs through piloting Garden Mosaics in other countries.  Tidball also saw the potential for a program that incorporated local and scientific  knowledge and community action to be useful in other multi-ethnic democracies.  We chose to focus on South Africa because, similar to the U.S., its education  system faces issues related to past racism and to poverty, multi-culturalism, and  multi-lingualism among students. South Africa is also a leader in programs and  research related to environmental education, indigenous knowledge, and  community gardening, so we expected that local educators would have valuable  insights to contribute to the process of adapting Garden Mosaics.    Thus, during the summer of 2005, Cornell graduate students Kendra Liddicoat and  Jamila Simon spent five weeks working with the Environment and Language  Educational Trust (ELET) in Durban, South Africa, to implement Garden Mosaics in  two low-resource schools, Sandasonke and Khethamahle, in nearby black  townships. At each school, ELET had hired three unemployed local residents to start  a garden on the school grounds. However, unlike school gardens in the U.S., there  were few efforts to link garden-based learning with the school curriculum; rather  these gardens were viewed as a means of training local, low-skilled people, and of  producing needed fresh food. The gardens were located on the school grounds in  part because the schools had significant areas of unused land, were fenced and  thus provided protection against damage by animals and by vandalism, and had  access to water.    Approximately 60 learners at Sandasonke and 26 learners at Khethamahle, all in  grade seven (10-14 years old), engaged in Garden Mosaics. Most learners,  gardeners, and collaborating teachers spoke isiZulu as their mother tongue, with  some speaking English as a second language. Within a period of three weeks, the  researchers conducted five sessions at Khethamahle and six at Sandasonke,  ranging in length from one-and-a-half to three hours.      </page> <page sequence="6"> Sharing Programs across Cultures: Lessons from Garden Mosaics in South Africa 242  At both schools, we began with a day of introductions, allowing the learners and the  teachers to get to know us and one another. To make the concept of Garden  Mosaics clearer, we asked each learner to draw a body part (e.g., hand, foot, or  face) and to write something about him/herself. We then created a large poster  “mosaic” of the learners and their work. Anticipating that the learners might be  curious about their two program facilitators from overseas, we also set aside time  for them to ask questions about our backgrounds.     Due to the limited time frame, we chose to adapt and facilitate two of the four  “i⋅m⋅science investigations,” the Neighborhood Exploration and the Gardener Story,  and then initiate a short Action Project. For the Neighborhood Exploration, we were  able to print local aerial photographs and topographic maps from the eThekwini  Municipality website (http://citymaps.durban.gov.za/) and use them to help the  learners identify relevant landmarks and assets in their community (e.g., clinics,  churches, and places to buy fresh vegetables, talk with friends, enjoy nature, and  hold community events). In the process, the learners discovered how many  activities actually take place at their school and generated ideas about what could  be improved in the school and surrounding area. Whereas in the U.S. the youth  would have conducted a walk around the neighborhood to “ground truth” their  observations from the airphotos and maps, concerns about crime in the areas  surrounding the schools prevented this activity. Thus, to help the learners  understand how a map relates to physical space, we concluded the Neighborhood  Exploration by making a “human” model of the neighborhood in the school yard  with each learner representing a map location.     With their increased awareness of the assets and problems of the area surrounding  their schools, the learners next explored their school garden and its contributions to  their community. The learners conducted the Gardener Story investigation, which  involved interviewing the community members working in the garden. They began  by reviewing the guiding questions for this investigation and translating them into  IsiZulu with the help of one of the teachers. The learners then interviewed the  community workers to find out where they were from, how they learned to garden,  what they were growing, what techniques they used, and how the garden related to  their cultural traditions. At one of the schools, the learners also gained familiarity  with the names and uses of the many indigenous medicinal plants in the garden.  We then helped the learners and teachers compile this information to be posted on  the Garden Mosaics website  (http://www.gardenmosaics.cornell.edu/pgs/data/storysearch.aspx).    We next engaged the learners at Sandasonke and Khethamahle in an Action  Project. The learners began by brainstorming projects in small groups, based on  their interests, observations of community needs, and suggestions by the  gardeners. The learners’ ideas for their Action Projects included picking up litter,  creating compost, planting their own garden, creating labels for the garden plants,  and starting a tuck shop (informal grocery stand) to sell the vegetables. The  learners at Khethamahle then voted on the options and decided to create signs  identifying the plants for visitors. At Sandasonke, they decided they wanted to help  market the vegetables. The learners created plant labels, posters, price lists, and    </page> <page sequence="7"> Sharing Programs across Cultures: Lessons from Garden Mosaics in South Africa 243  letters to local shops, and presented these to the gardeners at the completion of  the Garden Mosaics program. Descriptions of the two Action Projects were also  posted on the Garden Mosaics website  (http://www.gardenmosaics.cornell.edu/pgs/data/actionsearch.aspx).    Throughout the program we engaged in action research with the youth to  understand the resources and needs of their community and in participatory  observation to evaluate the success of the pilot Garden Mosaics program. During  our five weeks in Durban, each researcher kept a journal describing our  experiences and reflecting on how our own backgrounds influenced our work and  perceptions, we observed each other with the learners, reviewed student materials  such as lists of Action Project ideas, and discussed our successes and challenges  with both ELET and Garden Mosaics developer Krasny. At the conclusion of the  program, we also interviewed one teacher and one principal and conducted a focus  group with 16 learners at one school. We reviewed these various sources of data  during and at the conclusion of our study, looking for themes related both to  Garden Mosaics and to program adaptation in general.     Adapting Garden Mosaics: Lessons Learned  Our experiences piloting Garden Mosaics in South Africa shed light on how each of  the five attributes introduced above influences the appropriateness of a particular  program for implementation across cultures. All five themes were indeed relevant  to our work, but the challenges we encountered revealed that the way they were  addressed in the Garden Mosaics program was not always optimal.    Garden Mosaics Was Originally Designed for Use with Multicultural and  Multi-Lingual Populations  As a curriculum intended for use in urban settings and one that values inter-cultural  learning and exchange, Garden Mosaics had already encountered challenges related  to non-English speaking audiences in the U.S. To make the curriculum more  accessible there, the Science Pages and many other program materials have been  translated into Spanish, and a subset of materials are available in French, Arabic,  and Russian (http://www.gardenmosaics.cornell.edu/globalmosaics/index.htm). In  South Africa, as in the U.S., we needed to consider the political and social, as well  as the practical, implications of language choice for Garden Mosaics programs.     In the South African school setting, the designated language of learning and  teaching (LoLT) has long been controversial due to historical inequities and power  relationships. In post-apartheid South Africa, language policies reflect efforts to  create a more democratic society and there are now 11 official languages in the  country. These recent changes both promote the right of children to be educated in  their native language and offer the opportunity for all to be educated in English  (Kamwangamalu 2004). In practice, due to the legacy of Bantu Education, which  stigmatized mother-tongue instruction, and to the economic values associated with  English, use of English in schools has grown significantly while the African  languages have been marginalized (de Wet 2002; Kamwangamalu 2004). However,  many African children have limited exposure to English outside of school and their  teachers also have limited proficiency (Broeder et al., n.d.). Consequently, there is    </page> <page sequence="8"> Sharing Programs across Cultures: Lessons from Garden Mosaics in South Africa 244  constant code-switching, for example, switching back to the mother tongue in order  to explain a concept the youth do not understand in English, or using English words  for new technologies or other concepts where there is no equivalent in the learners’  native language (Zungu 1998). Among educators, there is concern that the use of  English as the LoLT in the early grades hinders the learners’ ability to understand  key concepts and acquire necessary skills (Webb 2004).     Language barriers played a large role in our interactions with teachers, learners,  and gardeners in South Africa. During the youth activities, we taught in English  because this was the official LoLT at the two schools and because we do not speak  isiZulu, the local language. However, English was not the mother tongue of any of  the teachers, learners or gardeners, so many of our questions and instructions had  to be translated into isiZulu by the teachers. This created a necessity for code- switching between isiZulu and English for basic communication and, inevitably,  some of the meaning and class rapport was lost in the process. Nevertheless, when  learners from the KwaMashu township were interviewed about their language  preference for the program they chose English, but mentioned the need for some  isiZulu for learners who might not understand English. Similarly, the teachers,  principals, and ELET staff felt that the learners benefited from the opportunity to  speak English with two Americans, but some wanted future Garden Mosaics  educators to be proficient in the local language as well. Views on the appropriate  language for educational materials were equally mixed. These split views are not  surprising, given the larger questions about appropriate LoLT in a country that both  values indigenous knowledge and acknowledges that English is often the language  of power (de Wet 2002).    For Garden Mosaics, the question of appropriate language is particularly important  because of the program’s emphases on community-based intergenerational learning  and indigenous knowledge. For example, one of the central goals of the Gardener  Story i⋅m⋅science investigation is to provide the youth with indigenous or culturally- based understandings of the concepts explained in Western-based science curricula.  For this reason, we were at times uncomfortable with the idea that one attractive  benefit for the participating learners was the opportunity to practice their English  with native speakers. This use of Garden Mosaics to foster competency in a  formerly colonial language seemed contradictory. At the same time, as Western  educators, we also needed to be aware of the stigma placed on promoting  education in less economically powerful local languages (Kamwangamalu 2004).     From a broader view, our collective struggles with language highlight a way in  which Garden Mosaics could be viewed as an effective model for a curriculum  intended for international use. The learners were gaining familiarity with a different  culture and language by communicating with us and using Garden Mosaics  materials developed in the U.S., while at the same time learning science in their  local language and context from the gardeners.     Garden Mosaics Incorporates Intergenerational Learning  Intergenerational communication and learning is one of the primary educational  strategies used in Garden Mosaics. These interactions are intended to benefit both    </page> <page sequence="9"> Sharing Programs across Cultures: Lessons from Garden Mosaics in South Africa 245  youth and elders in a variety of ways. Youth may discover caring, knowledgeable  adults in their community and begin to learn from them as mentors (VanderVen  2004). As relationships develop, youth also may gain greater respect for elders in  their community. In an intergenerational environmental education program, youth  can gain perspectives and natural history knowledge that peers and program  leaders lack (Liu and Kaplan 2006). Finally, the elder gardeners may feel a greater  sense of self-worth as a result of the youths’ interest in their knowledge, and in  turn, may give back more to the youth and the community (Krasny and Tidball  2007a). Statements by the South African learners demonstrated that this was in  fact occurring. For example, in our focus group at the end of our time with them,  the learners commented:    I like all [the activities] because the gardeners, they share.    [I learned to] not undermine the people who work in the garden. How to  behave in the garden...know that the principal and everyone uses the garden  to survive.    Garden people keep busy. Garden is not for old people.    Don't be a thief. If you are hungry, don't take food from the old people. If  you are hungry, tell the gardeners and say please.    Intergenerational learning can also encourage transfer of scientific or environmental  knowledge from youth to elders (Ballantyne et al. 2001; Gallagher and Hogan  2000; Johnson-Pynn and Johnson 2005; Vaughan et al. 2003). Although we did not  interview the community gardeners as to whether this was true for them, the  principal at one of the schools expressed the belief that Garden Mosaics was  encouraging such transfer of knowledge to parents. She stated, “I think it will be  better if gardening is propagated by the learners. They will go home and tell their  parents that gardening is important and the community will know that is  important.”     However, our emphasis on intergenerational learning met with some challenges in  the South African context In many ways, the Gardener Story i⋅m⋅science  investigation, in which youth interview elders about their planting practices and  cultural traditions, was particularly appropriate within a cultural setting that  emphasizes respect for elders (Shumba 1999). However, similar to African  educators using inquiry-based methods, we struggled to find a balance between  encouraging the learners to ask questions and maintaining culturally appropriate  interactions across generations (Shumba 1999). While conducting the Gardener  Story, learners seemed uncomfortable posing and answering direct questions and  often circumvented our requests to do so by taking their cues from the teachers  regarding what to say. This situation was at times reinforced by the teachers and  continued throughout the program, including during the focus group interview  where one teacher, who also served as translator, gave the learners answers to  some of our interview questions. In addition, the gardeners appeared to feel  uncomfortable in the classroom and thus initially were reluctant to answer our    </page> <page sequence="10"> Sharing Programs across Cultures: Lessons from Garden Mosaics in South Africa 246  questions or to introduce themselves. Once the interview was extended to the  outdoors, the gardeners were more talkative and answered questions for the  Gardener Story.     Garden Mosaics Draws on Local and Scientific Knowledge  Kasanda et al. (2005) posit that everyday contexts are replete with local knowledge  and that educators can use such contexts and knowledge to improve understanding  of science concepts. Similarly, Aikenhead (1996) suggests that transitions between  the everyday and scientific contexts require “border crossing,” and that  incorporating local knowledge or context into academic learning can help learners  cross such borders and thus more readily learn Western science. During the Garden  Mosaics activities, the learners asked the gardeners about planting techniques;  thus, the community gardeners acted as “cultural brokers” for learners navigating  between African and Western ideas of science and agriculture (Fakudze 2004;  Jegede 1995; 1999).    During the Gardener Story, both the learners and the educators became aware of  the rich local knowledge the gardeners were able to contribute. The gardeners first  talked about where they had learned to garden and how they were raised. This  story involved sharing their parents’ beliefs about the meaning of gardening, after  which the educators reinforced the gardeners’ local knowledge. At the end of the  interview, when the learners were given a tour of the garden, they were able to  understand how the gardeners put their local knowledge into action as the  gardeners pointed out medicinal plants and their use in treating diseases. The  learners used what they learned from the gardeners to help plan their Action  Projects.    The learners also drew upon their own local knowledge during several of the  activities. While conducting the Neighborhood Exploration mapping activity, the  learners were able to indicate the location of tuck shops where they buy fruit and  vegetables. The learners also shared their knowledge of the physical components of  their community, identifying the roads that they use to walk to school. Additionally,  the learners as well as the educators used their knowledge of isiZulu and other  languages during the Gardener Story to ask questions and transmit the gardener’s  answers for other learners and for the researchers. Finally, the educators  contributed their knowledge about the history of gardening within their culture in  helping the learners to plan their Action Projects.      Garden Mosaics Focuses on a Universally-Relevant Issue, i.e., Sustainable  Food Production, and Actively Engages Youth in Addressing This Issue  through Conducting a Local Action Project  Garden Mosaics was developed for use in urban community gardens in the U.S. and  its curriculum draws on the uniqueness of these gardens as sites for science and  environmental learning, multicultural understanding, and community action.  Community gardens in the U.S. serve as places for immigrants to maintain their  culture (Armstrong 2000; Saldivar-Tanaka and Krasny 2004) and for people of  many backgrounds to work together (Corkery 2004; Shinew et al. 2004). They also    </page> <page sequence="11"> Sharing Programs across Cultures: Lessons from Garden Mosaics in South Africa 247  foster community cohesion and ownership, which can lead to empowerment and  advocacy (Glover 2003; Hancock 2001; Hanna and Oh 2000; Westphal 2003).     While urban gardens in South Africa have been shown to provide similar benefits  (Lindow 2005; Slater 2001), for the gardeners, educators, and youth with whom we  worked, food production was the overriding reason for their interest in the garden  and in Garden Mosaics. In contrast to many U.S. community gardens, which are  initiated by neighborhood residents, the Durban school gardens were initiated by  ELET’s Inanda Ntuzuma KwaMashu (INK) Greening program and tended by paid  community members. The primary purposes of INK Greening were employment and  job skills training, food production for the feeding scheme (school lunches), and  revenue generation through the sale of vegetables. ELET staff, educators,  gardeners, and youth all indicated that additional emphasis on and instruction in  specific agricultural techniques would have been welcome in addition to, or in place  of, the socially focused activities we led. The learners’ choice of Action Projects  (creating signs and marketing materials) reflects this utilitarian view of the garden.  Consequently, it appears that although the overarching theme and context of  Garden Mosaics—sustainable agriculture—is relevant across cultures, a more direct  connection between the curriculum and this theme may be needed in developing  countries.     Garden Mosaics Was Designed to Be Used in a Variety of Settings with the  Educators Selecting and Adapting Activities Appropriate for Their  Audiences  Consistent with the literature on program adoption and dissemination (Krasny  2005), Garden Mosaics is designed so that individual resources or activities can  stand alone or be used together as a complete program. For example, some groups  have used a single Garden Mosaics Science Page  (http://www.gardenmosaics.cornell.edu/pgs/science/mainscience.htm) to learn  about a particular concept, whereas other groups complete the entire sequence of  four i⋅m⋅science investigations and an Action Project, referring to the appropriate  Science Pages throughout. Thus, in South Africa, we were able to pick and choose  the activities and Science Pages most suitable for our learners, and we also created  new activities when called for (e.g., an introductory activity to get across the  concept of “mosaics”).     Garden Mosaics also uses technology flexibly, although the lack of access to  computers and the Internet limited the experience of the South African learners. In  the U.S., Garden Mosaics participants can access the Science Pages and read  Gardener Stories and the results of other i⋅m⋅science investigations that groups  have posted on the internet. Educators and youth also can use the training DVD to  view other youth groups conducting the investigations and Action Projects, and  using the online Science Pages to reinforce what they learn from gardeners. Finally,  the youth post the results of their investigations and Action Projects on the project  website. Lacking access to computers or the Internet at the schools and within the  township, we had to adapt the program accordingly. We used paper versions of the  Science Pages, located maps and aerial photographs online ourselves and printed  them out for the learners to use in the Neighborhood Exploration, and entered    </page> <page sequence="12"> Sharing Programs across Cultures: Lessons from Garden Mosaics in South Africa 248  results of the investigations and Action Projects online later when we regained  Internet access. Given that reporting is considered one of the four key components  of an effective environmental education program, along with information seeking,  inquiry, and action (O’Donoghue and Russo 2004), the fact that our learners had  the opportunity to share their work with the gardeners and school administrators  in-person makes up, at least in part, for the lack of opportunity to submit their  information to the Garden Mosaics website. However, the lack of Internet access  did negatively impact their ability to join in the “global” Garden Mosaics web- mediated community; specifically, they were not able to see the work of other  groups and to experience sharing their work more broadly.     Reflections  We went to South Africa with an underlying belief in the value and the reciprocal  nature of our efforts. We thought that we would offer resources and ideas that  would benefit South African youth, educators, and gardeners, and in turn, we would  benefit by learning about program adaptation and about ways we could enhance  our youth education initiatives in the U.S. As described above, it appears that both  sides did indeed gain from the experience. The South African learners, teachers,  principals, and gardeners successfully participated in many of the Garden Mosaics  activities, and, at the end, indicated that the program increased knowledge and  enthusiasm for garden-based science education. We learned from the process as  well and have used our South African experiences to improve U.S. Garden Mosaics  programs. Since our return, we have engaged over 200 youth in New York in a new  series of learning activities that explore related local and South African issues, thus  enhancing the students’ global environmental knowledge and fulfilling our South  African learners’ yearning for more youth in the U.S. to learn about their culture  (Simon 2007). However, despite these successes, our experience also highlighted  shortcomings in our implementation strategy and in Garden Mosaics as a model  cross-national program.     Although we intended our efforts to be as participatory as the curriculum itself  through our collaboration with ELET, in reality, we made many of the same  mistakes as other educators trying to work across cultures. Gray (1999) captures  these common pitfalls, explaining that    Many projects are funded for unrealistically short periods of time...Problems  also arise when the “experts” are educators recruited from...tertiary  institutions, and have the necessary experience in science education but little  in the way of...project management experience. They are then plunged into a  context and culture that is quite foreign to them and are expected to deliver  the goods. Some do, but many do not. Success has also hinged around  issues such as real acknowledgment, and use of, the wealth of local  experience and knowledge that does exist; ownership by the practitioners of  what is developed; employing curriculum development strategies that are  holistic in nature and contextually relevant; and developing support  structures that will sustain the effort beyond the life of the initial project  (265).      </page> <page sequence="13"> Sharing Programs across Cultures: Lessons from Garden Mosaics in South Africa 249  We did acknowledge and use the local experience and knowledge of the gardeners,  and attempted to adapt our program to make it contextually relevant, but  reciprocity involves more than integrating local knowledge into Western-based  curriculum for non-Western audiences. The issues that arose regarding  intergenerational communication provide evidence for the limited effectiveness of  our approach. Moreover, logistics and funding constrained our ability to develop  longer-term collaborations with teachers, which would have enabled us to better  address issues of equitability related to different pedagogical approaches and to  facilitate program sustainability. Finally, the very fact that we were Americans who  traveled to South Africa to adapt a U.S.-designed curriculum indicated that we were  responding to some real or perceived deficiency in existing South African education.  In this sense, the work in which we were engaged blurs the lines between  education and the type of international service that assumes the outsider has the  ability to address a deficit in the developing country (McBride and Daftary 2005). In  short, we learned that in any educational intervention, even one that evolved  through participatory means and that explicitly deals with multi-cultural concerns,  the intertwined issues of colonization, power, language, and culture need to be  addressed. We also observed that for a program to be sustained, more work must  be done up front and throughout the process to allow the host institutions to be  involved in its design and implementation. Through the whole experience, we came  to further appreciate what we were hoping our program participants would learn,  i.e., that each of us needs to fully understand our current place to make a  difference locally and that we all need to practice effectively working together as  global citizens.     Discovering the “space in between” local and global learning is gaining in  importance as people, environmental problems, and plants and animals increasingly  cross national boundaries, and as the distinctions between local and global thus  become increasingly blurred (Krasny and Tidball 2007b). At the same time, creating  programs that occupy this space in between the local and global is challenging, and  necessitates work across cultural and national boundaries. Gough (2002) explains  that    ‘(T)hinking globally’ in science and environmental education might best be  understood as a process of creating transnational ‘spaces’ in which scholars  from different localities collaborate in reframing and decentring their own  knowledge traditions and negotiate trust in each other’s contributions to their  collective work (1233).     Through our work, we indeed experienced such reframing and decentring. It  became clear that although Garden Mosaics is designed for use in multicultural  settings, incorporates intergenerational learning, draws on local knowledge,  addresses a widely relevant issue, and was intended to be adapted, it was not fully  usable in a new context. Additional research is needed to determine how programs  can be better designed for use in multiple settings, how they can be developed in a  truly collaborative manner, and whether certain topics and instructional techniques  are indeed universally applicable.      </page> <page sequence="14"> Sharing Programs across Cultures: Lessons from Garden Mosaics in South Africa 250    Acknowledgements  We would like to thank the ELET staff, especially Nontobeko Gasa, the teachers and  principals of Sandasonke and Khethamahle Primary Schools, and all of the learners who  participated in our program for making this research possible.
