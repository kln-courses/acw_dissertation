<plain_text><page sequence="1">123 A Review of Through a Window Richard Shelly Hartigan Department of Political Science Loyola University Chicago 6525 N. Sheridan Road Chicago, Illinois 60626 Jane Goodall must be one of the best known scientists of the past generation and a half. She possesses star quality and celebrity status, owing in part to her sponsorship by the late Louis B. Leakey and subsequent adoption by the National Geographic Society as one of its house natural- ists. But these opportunities for visibility by themselves could never have sustained her reputation over thirty years were there not genuine substance to her work. Her position as a premier ethologist in the second generation of that fledgling science is as secure as is her popular image to the general, non-specialist public. It should be made clear at the outset of these remarks, therefore, that the present volume is aimed at this latter audience and that those of us with more than a superficial interest in primate studies will find nothing new or startling here. This is not a criticism at all because it is evident that the author had no intention of matching her summary monograph of 1986 (Goodall; The Chimpanzees of Gombe). For specialists, that work stands as the mother-lode to which one can return again and again for data and insight. Also in that work are the detailed descriptions of warfare and cannibalism that so shocked both professional and non-specialist audiences when she first reported them. These phenomena are neatly incorporated in abbreviated form in the present volume. Having indicated that Through a Window is not going to add anything new or substantial to the scientific literature, I must hasten to add that it deserves to be read on its own terms and as widely as possible by both general and specific audiences - the former for information, the latter for pure enjoyment. Through a Window is the author's promised sequel to her revised edition (1988) of In The Shadow Of Man, the book that in 1971 made her name. The present volume should not be misunderstood therefore as a popular remi- niscence and repetition of her earlier work. Indeed it should be recommended to those who are not familiar with In The Shadow Of Man that they read it before they read Through a Window. My dominant emotion in reading Through a Window was the pleasure of familiar encounters, for anyone who has followed Jane Goodall's career through her previous books and articles remembers well the dramatis personae of so many recounted incidents. They are all here again - sexy and motherly Flo, murderous and cannibalistic Pas- sion, poor doomed Flint, and the succession of ambitious and successful alpha males of the Gombe reserve that Goodall has called home and workplace for thirty years. If, sadly, she were never to report again on these fascinating creatures with whom she is so identified, this book will be a fitting conclusion to her work. In many respects a good part of the charm, and hence popularity of Goodall's work ? for the specialist as well as the general reader ? is due to the fact that her personal passion is so evident. This is as true in the present volume as in her past work. A recent review (Midgley, 1991) of a new book that deals in part with her (Montgomery, 1991) refers to criticism of Goodall, Dian Fossey and Birute Galdikas for unscientifically personalizing their subjects. What the reviewer correctly points out is that the critics fail to comprehend the subtleties of dealing with shy, wild creatures. One can only surmise how Goodall's studies would have been diminished in value had she not been such a caring person herself. The respect and even love that she feels for her chimps can hardly be held as a fault, intruding on her scientific objectivity. On the contrary, it contributes to our seeing one of the most important facts which she and other primatologists are insistent that we see - the individu- ality and unique personality possessed by our primate kin. Having come to know the chimps at Gombe through her eyes over the years, it seems in retrospect that it would be abominable for her not to have named them, but instead to have numbered them as some critics apparently suggested. However the methods of future ethologists improve - and they no doubt will - it is to be hoped that the clich? charge of anthropomorphism not frighten primatologists into a sterile rendering of their subjects. It is precisely her willingness to treat her subjects as individuals that accounts for some of Goodall's major contributions to primate study. Of major importance has been her detailing of the effects ? for good and ill ? of maternal influence on offspring. In the case of Flo who was a relaxed and confident mother, these traits of nurtur- ing were learned and passed on to her female offspring,</page><page sequence="2">124 Fifi, who became a good mother in her own right. Passion, on the other hand, as incompatible a sexual partner as Flo was attractive, evidenced little of the confidence with her own offspring that Flo had. Her daughter, Pom, though decidedly more attentive to her own offspring than her mother had been to her was a far site less competent as a mother than Fifi. Eventually Fifi became a very high ranking female in the group while her brother Figan was to be one of the most powerful alpha males in the reserve's history. In short, Flo's children were socially adept and successful, while Passion's were the reverse. The author herself ponders the question of how much of these results were due to nature, how much to nurture, with the predict- able conclusion that we cannot tell with certainty. Though this is of course true, it should not obscure Goodall's contribution in helping to redress the imbalance of envi- ronmental behaviorism: We may not know just how much influence genetic disposition and heritable traits have on primate behavior, but it cannot any longer be denied that it is considerable. So important (and effective) is this personalism of style as we might call the author's method that it provides the structure upon which she is able to hang most of her narrative. Thus "alphaism" among the males at Gombe is reported through chapters dealing with Figan and Goblin, while, what can only be termed a carefree, uninhibited sexuality is described through the example of a sterile female, Gigi. Her chapter on mother-son relationships is especially poignant as it characterizes a phenomenon that is all too common among human adolescent males - the ambivalence encountered in having to choose between the comfort and security of "mom's care," and the attraction of a place among the grown-up males of the group. These and other relationships (such as the play bonds that often exist between baboon and chimpanzee juveniles, and the evi- dence of males as loving caregivers to infants) are skill- fully described here so as to accomplish that which the reader looks for in a good novel?characters about whom we care. What is most evident in the author's final chapters, and two appendices, is the fact that her life of active fieldwork is probably over. She has in place an organization of students and managers, both local and imported, whose skill and dedication will guarantee the continuation of her work. Her time is now devoted to the fund-raising lecture circuit and the promotion of conservation and animal rights causes. A new generation of primatologists are building on her work (Frans de Waal and Michael Ghiglieri come immediately to mind), and, as is the wont of science, will no doubt amend and surpass it. Nevertheless, the effect of her work will be felt for generations. References De Waal, F. (1982). Chimpanzee Politics: Power and Sex Among Apes. New York: Harper and Row. _ (1989).
