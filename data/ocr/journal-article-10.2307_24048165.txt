They crowned col umns, pillars, and pilasters.18 Like most Indian capitals, their form does not resemble that of their Achaemenid ancestors. They can be square in sec tion, have four sides (on supporting columns and pillars), two sides (on corner columns and pilas ters), or have one side (on pilasters). The first of these types carried four, not two, animal protomes at the corners with a hypertrophied acanthus (as Fig. 2. Capital from Old Termez, detail, end of 2d c. B.c.-4th C. A.D. on the capital from Shahrinau, west of Dushanbe) or a human half-figure (on the capital from Shah rinau) at the center (fig. 3-a, b).

Compared with the Buddhist capitals of Central Asia, the Transcaucasian capitals mark the next stage in the development of this ancient architec tural and artistic element. Transcaucasian capitals, like those of Kushan Bactria, often contain religious characters and scenes. For instance, the capital of a memorial column from Egvard (5th/6th century) shows Daniel in the lion's den alongside zoomorphic motifs.26 Such designs occur fairly frequently and even more often the religious elements appear without any zoomorphic motifs. In most cases the latter type probably should be associated with another trend, that of anthropomorphic capitals going back to Egyptian capitals depicting the god dess Hathor,27 a trend which subsequently spread to Greece and Rome, as well as to Byzantium and medieval Europe, and which did not bypass Hel lenistic Georgia, Sasanian Iran, and Central Asia, as the surviving monuments reveal.28 In some cases, animals on Transcaucasian and Central Asian capitals reflect ancient local pagan beliefs, including those traceable, or related, to ancient Iran. In Bactria, for instance, we have the scenes of a beast of prey tearing an ungulate or the horned and winged lion-griffins described above. In the same category may be placed the Transcau casian capitals with winged lions (fig. 6; capital of Bolnisskii Sion, 3d or 4th quarter of the 5th cen tury; capital from Tsopi),29 with eagles (fig. 7; 7th century capital from Zvartnots),30 a series of 57</page><page sequence="6">s T a v I s K y: Zoomorphic Capitals scenes showing running animals (capital with 1 * ' 4^"' ! * winged lions and another one from Bolnisskii r Sion,31 and on the capital from Tsopi), a bear claw- f IB ing an ungulate (on a slab replacing a decorative j. : capital in a relief framing the door of a 10th- jEfuB century church at Khakhuli).32 X ■ However, such capitals are different from the \T ' JÊ&amp; Central Asian examples in that many of the JF» Transcaucasian animals were transformed to the Wm * degree that they lost any association with the ear- j •" jL, lier traditional beliefs and clearly became expres sive of the new religion.

Church."33 The deer on the capitals of Bolnisskii Sion and on the previously mentioned Egvard capital with Daniel in the lion's den is a "Christian symbol of a believing soul."34 The peacocks of Bolnisskii Sion and on the Minge chaur capital of the 6th/7th or 8th/10th centuries are a Christian symbol of immortality and resurrection.35 The lion, angel, bull, and eagle supplanting capitals in the relief framing the altar window of the church at Kumurdo (a.d. 964) are the evangelical symbols.36 These Transcaucasian capitals seem to have lost any relation to the zoomorphic capitals of Achaemenid Iran. They only share the idea of cap itals containing animal designs, while the form of the capitals and animal images were transmuted beyond recognition. However, the flute motif on a zoomorphic capital of Bolnisskii Sion is unmis takably of Achaemenid origin.37 The affinity is more apparent in a number of Georgian and Armenian capitals of the 11th-13th centuries.

The main fea ture of their use in these regions may be seen in the transformation of type and of ornamentation. Instead of two protomes of mighty animals, a varying number of both gentle and menacing an imals and diverse compositions appear. And they are used structurally to crown load-bearing col umns as well as on freestanding columns, pillars, and attached pilasters, and function ideologically as propaganda for Buddhism and Christianity. But while they are derived from one and the same source, and their development proceeded along close or parallel routes, the history of zoomorphic capitals in Central Asia and Transcaucasia differs owing to the different political, cultural and gen eral historical settings. In Central Asia, zoomor phic capitals were used most widely during the spread of Buddhism in the 1st half of the first mil lennium a.D., and in Transcaucasia in the 5th through 13th centuries during the spread of Chris tianity. In Transcaucasian Christian monuments, animal designs continued to be used much later, as for instance on the small attached columns sur mounted by serpent heads on the 17th-century belfry at Echmiadzin.44 In Central Asia, this tra dition was abandoned back in the Middle Ages, after the advent of Islam, which renounced the use of figurai motifs for religious propaganda. Notes * Central Asia is used here to denote an historical cultural region which, in accordance with a UNESCO decision, is comprised of the Soviet republics of Ka zakhstan, Kirghizia, Turkmenia, Tajikistan, and Uz bekistan, as well as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and north ern India.
