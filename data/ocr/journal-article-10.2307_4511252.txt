<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vol. XXXVII Recent Literature [77 1966 pictures are copies of each made in the early 17th century by another unknown hand for the use of Reverend Topsell, his unpublished "Virginia Birds." Water-color painting was a highly developed technique by the year 1500 and John White, born much later in the century, was an artist of stature. His original pictures as recently reproduced in "The American Drawings of John White" by David Beers Quinn (1964) show him to have been a man who gave great attention to detail. His water-color of a Flamingo is as fine and as beautiful as any painting by Fuertes or by Singer. To introduce his excellent work to an audience through reproductions of crude copies misrepresents the ability, technique, and talent of a fine artist. We have no assurance that John White did the first water-color paintings of North American birds. Much untouched material still reposes in European archives, and the first water colors of birds may well have been done by some Spaniard or Frenchman before John White was born, though none has yet come to light. But John White was definitely the first English artist to paint North American birds. The first North American birds John White painted, of which the originals survive in the British Museum, were the Tropic Bird, the Frigate Bird, the Brown Booby, and the Noddy Tern. The paired pictures in Mr. Harrison's book are identified by Roger Tory Peterson as Female Red-eyed Towhee, Eastern Bluebird, Yellow-shafted Flicker, Blue Jay, Common Grackle (without a Topsell copy), Red-wing, and Oriole (possibly Baltimore), Common Loon, Male Red-eyed Towhee, and Sandhill Crane. Of the oriole Mr. Peterson says, "But if it is actually a Virginia bird it would have to be the Baltimore-unless the boat stopped at tropical American ports." The ship did stop at tropical American ports. White did not label his paintings with place names or dates. He made at least five trips to Virginia and started painting flora and fauna when on his first voyage in 1585 the expedition stopped to trade with the Spanish in Puerto Rico and Haiti. During his fifth voyage in 1590 White spent months in the West Indies. As the oriole painting most closely resembles the Troupial, Icterus icterus (according to Oliver L. Austin, Jr.), it may well have been a cage bird brought from mainland South America to the West Indies, as so many birds were by Spanish aviarists.-Elizabeth S. Austin. 63. The Personality of the Bird. Edited by Brandt Aymar. 1965. Crown Publishers, Inc., New York, N. Y. 170 pp., 29 black and white illustrations. $4.95. Mr. Aymar justifies his title by giving each of 37 bits and pieces of bird-inspired writing a new anthropomorphic super-title thus: "The Lovelorn Bird" is Percy Bysshe Shelley's "A Widow Bird": "The Reliable Bird" is "To the Cuckoo" by Michael Bruce; "The Lonely Bird' is "Seekonk, the Sea Gull" by Paul Annixter; "The Harmonious Bird" is a tern (no species given) in a story called "Victory" by Herbert Evans; and "The Uncooperative Bird" is a Bald Eagle in an excerpt from Saul Bellow's novel "The Adventures of Augie March." Mr. Aymar might be called a "downy bird" for finding a reason to put such authors as Alfred Lord Tennyson, Albert Payson Terhune, Emily Dickinson, Don Tracy, John Burroughs, Edward Lear, Ernest Thompson Seton, John Keats, Herbert Ravenel Sass, and Shelley and Bellow under one cover. The publisher's blurb on the jacket calls this book an anthology. Webster's Dictionary defines anthology as "a collection of flowers of literature." Mr. Aymar's collection of writings does not live up to this definition. In his choice of works by great literary names, he seems to have selected examples of their more mediocre writing. In these articles, essays, verses, and short stories Mr. Aymar has collected an astonishing amount of misinformation about birds. According to Paul Annixter, for instance, gulls live to be close to a hundred years old, pelicans summer in Hud- son Bay, a gull's voice croaks with age, and individual adult gulls of the same species vary as much as two inches in length! A talking chimney swallow, a philo- sophizing, conversational mockingbird, and an emotional gannet are the motifs for three stories. Several accounts of the behavior of caged and tamed birds are factual and good. The excerpt from "Blind Jack" by Stephanie Ryder, although out of con- text, is among the best of these. "Good-by, Black Prince" by Elizabeth Waldo Wright and "Raff, the Jungle Bird" by Zetta and Carveth Wells are two more good ones. The articles by Ernest Thompson Seton, Herbert Ravenel Sass, and John Burroughs are what one would expect from these naturalist authors, well written, full of information, and factually correct.</page><page sequence="2">78] Recent Literature Bird-Banding January I great]y enjoyed "Ismaques, the Fishhawk" by William Joseph Long, a well- told tale. Mr. Aymar gives no aeknowledgment of the souree of this story, but the Rev. Long (1866-1952), B. A. Harvard, Ph.D. lIeidelberg, was a well-known elergyman and naturalist author at the turn of the eentury, whose works are ap- parently now in the publie domain. No longer eovered by eopyright, this tale and twenty other involuntary eontributions to this book ean be legally republished without so mueh as a "thank you" to those who wrote them. As most of the illust;rations are in the same eategory, Mr. Aymar and/or Crown Publishers are spared the expense of paying royalties to authors and artists. Under these eireum- stanees they eould have been more generous with words. A few laiographieal faets about each eontributor, and the date and plaee of original publieation of eaeh article would have been a pleasing addition to the book and a eourtesy to the authors.

Club., No. 5, xiii + 142 pp. 61 tables and 22 figures. $4.00. This book is the result of studying Long-billed Marsh Wrens for five years in Georgia, ehiefly in the salt marshes of Sapelo Island. These wrens are not only residents in the marsh but also are one of the three avian species oeeupy- ing a prominent ecologie position in the salt marsh eommunity of Georgia. Hence it has been the ultimate objective of Dr. Kale "to estimate the total energy flow through an avian population in its natural eeological system" espeeially because such data are generally searce for any avian species. Part I is eoneerned with breeding biology of the speeies, the results being summarized in 23 pages and numerous tables. The usual topies are eovered- territorialism, start of breeding, song, nidifieation, and egg-laying. Average clutch-size deereased during the breeding season from 4.6 to 3.8, although nearly 60% of the nests contained five eggs. Eggs are laid between early April and mid- August, and one female has no more than two broods in a given year. The ineuba- tion period was found to be about 13 days and nestling period, 12 to 13 days. In most years the mean date of the start of nesting eorrelated with an environmental temperature of about 16 Â°C. The eonelusion "that eluteh size inereases with lati- tude with the Long-billed Marsh Wren . . ." is quite tenuous beeause of the ad- mittedly seant data available for more northerly subspeeies of Telmatodytes patustrts. Part II is entitled "Population Eeology and Bioenergeties" and embraees some 57 pages of text material. Herein the author presents valuable quantitative data on territory size, natality, mortality, nesting sueeess, population densities stomach eontents, and energy aspeets of individuals and populations of wrens. Average territory-size in the Spartina salt marshes was 100 m2, but it varied from 30-242 m2. Eeologieal density was found to be 18-23 pairs/aere of suitable nesting area; utilized area density ( = territorial area aetually oeeupied) was 41-45 pairs/ aere. Feeding experiments suggested that individual eaged wrens used 8.8 keal of metabolizable energy per 10 g bird per day. Studies of oxygen eonsumption of eaged birds indieated that "aetive birds" had a rate of metabolism of 8.2 keal/ bird/day. A summary of population energy flow for the wrens, expressed in keal/m2/yr., yielded the following information-intake from food sourees (ehiefly arthropods and some detritus), 126- mean annual production, 0.5, loss through respiration, 88; loss through feees, 38. Although these are average figures and per- haps representative ones, the reader should be aware of likely annual fluetuations and the faet that many estimates? also subjeet to wide variations, were used in arriving at the figures. The number of tables (61) in the book is formidable, and I found it quite dis- eoncerting that some tables are loeated among the text material whereas others Gertainly of no less importanee, are in various appendiees toward the end of the book. Preeise data obtained on oxygen eonsumption suffered, I suspeet, by the use of a relatively erude apparatus, a set-up whieh most eontemporary vertebrate physiologists would not employ. :EPurthermore, had the author used a different King-Farner equation in predicting basal rates of metabolism, namely their form- ula suggested for birds weighing less than 0.125 kg, he would have found that his oxygen consumption data on wrens fit a point on the King-Farner curve rather closely. In fact, the "correct" King-Farner equation would have predicted a value of approximately 5.7 keal for a 10 g wren's daily energy requirement. Kale pre-</page></plain_text>
