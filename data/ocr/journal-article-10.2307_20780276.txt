At the point he is indicted, the "drug dealer" is, of course, only a suspected drug dealer. Over the past 40 years, Congress has dutifully responded to the conse quences of an expanding illegal drug trade by passing legislation aimed at hitting drug traffickers where it hurts most: the wallet. Modern federal forfeiture and money laundering statutes have enabled prosecutors to seize tainted money and other instruments of illegality before convictions are obtained, and without adver sarial probable cause hearings. In order to arm law enforcement in the war on drugs, Con gress codified certain legal fictions. Legal fictions are defined as false assumptions treated as fact in the advancement of justice. They are not necessarily controversial. Treating corporations as "persons" for legal purposes is an example of a non-controversial, generally accepted and often used legal fiction. However, two legal fictions created to advance the government's so-called war on drugs undermine the principles of the United States Constitution. The first is the "relation back" fiction: that title in all forfeitable property vests in the government the instant a crime is commit ted.2 Both opponents and proponents of federal forfeiture law rec ognize relation back's fictive status,3 but its opponents have rightly noted that it contradicts core principles of American crimi nal justice, which deem a suspect innocent until proven guilty and require the government to prove every element of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.4 Nevertheless, in 1970, the Court narrowly 1.

In a well-reasoned dissent by Justice Blackmun, who observed that pre-conviction forfeiture interferes with a defendant's ability to secure counsel of choice and a fair trial, the issue was framed as "whether Congress may use this wholly fictive device of property law to cut off th[e] funda mental right[s] of the accused in a criminal case."5 The second controversial legal fiction allows anthropomorphic in rem forfeiture's unjust extension into criminal matters. The fic tion supporting in rem forfeiture allows the government to seize an object on account of its illegal behavior, circumventing the criminal procedural protections that are triggered by in personam confrontation between the government and the object's owner, who is often punished through deprivation of property. Like cor porate entity status, the fictions allowing current money launder ing and forfeiture practice have been codified, but this fact does not exempt them from constitutional scrutiny by Article III courts, presently derelict in their duty.6 This failure has armed prosecu tors whom we cannot blame for adopting the mantra, "whatever works is alright."7 Prosecutors are not at fault for using the tools at their disposal; effective litigators should use every allowable advantage to achieve a desired result. The current problem cen ters on the tactics allowed by the federal courts. In the past decade, the more populous Canadian provinces have enacted civil forfeiture legislation aimed at crushing a grow ing criminal drug trade.8 These relatively new laws emulate American federal law by adopting the relation back fiction and bypassing criminal defendant protections by fusing lax civil law Standard plays a vital role in the American scheme of criminal procedure . . .

The Canadian Supreme Court recently decided Chatterjee, a jurisdictional challenge to Canada's provin cial "civil" forfeiture laws.10 The appellants in Chatterjee argued that given the many criminal and punishment-related aspects of "civil" forfeiture laws, they are ultra vires of provincial legislative power, offering an interesting corollary to related American law regarding forfeiture. What Constitutional right does a drug smuggler have to use the fruits of his illegal activity to hire a lawyer?11 None according to the Supreme Court, because the relation back fiction allows the government to label him a "drug smuggler" before he is convicted. The in rem forfeiture fiction then allows the government to seize the alleged proceeds and instrumentalities through civil means without affording the alleged drug smuggler the ordinary procedu ral protections common in seizure hearings. To be faithful to the Constitution however, the question should be rephrased to ask: what Constitutional right does a suspected drug smuggler have to use the alleged fruits of his illegal activity to hire a lawyer? If the government cannot establish probable cause to seize the stolen money as evidence in the ensuing case, the presumptively inno cent defendant has an absolute right to do so under the Sixth Amendment. Currently, however, courts allow the government to restrain allegedly dirty assets on the basis of "reasonable belief," a standard easier for the government to meet than probable cause. Moreover, unlike probable cause hearings, many forfeiture hear ings occur ex parte, thereby preventing the defendant from con testing the government's attainment of this minimal burden of proof. Although the framers did not view a deprivation of prop erty to be as serious as a deprivation of liberty, they understood that property preserves other core rights. Forfeiture itself is not as problematic as rights deprived as a result. Procedural rules must 9. Compare Criminal Forfeitures, 21 U.S.C. ? 853 (2006) with Civil Remedies Act, supra note 8. 10.

This article argues that the courts' undue deference to the relation back and in rem legal fictions, as applied in criminal related matters, has unjustly averted fair First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Eighth Amendment scrutiny. Furthermore, these fic tions have had international implications by enabling similar abuses in Canada. Part II describes the historical background of federal statutes relating to forfeiture and money laundering, the Court's conception of the constitutional status of these laws, and how these prosecutorial tools are used in practice. Part III argues that the current Constitutional edifice supporting forfeiture and money laundering in circumstances that should trigger ordinary criminal defendant procedural protections is buttressed by flimsy legal fictions, violating the original intention of the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Eighth Amendments of the Constitution. Part IV compares current American law in this area with recently enacted civil forfeiture laws in Canadian provinces and the juris dictional challenge of these laws in the Chatterjee case, forecasting the social and legal effects of its disposition. Part V suggests ways that Congress, the courts and law enforcement officials can achieve crime-fighting objectives within the bounds of law. II. History, Mechanics, and Current State of Law A. Statutory and Historical Background In 1970, faced with a mounting American social problem aris ing from organized crime and the illegal drug trade, Congress took a major step into the criminal arena, an area of the law mostly confined to the states before then, and passed the Racketeer Influ enced and Corrupt Organizations Act ("RICO")12 and the Continu ing Criminal Enterprise Statute ("CCE").13 These expansive 12.

United States, 464 U.S. 16, 27 (1983) (pointing out that RICO is the only federal criminal statute expressly intended to be interpreted liberally to effectuate its crucial law enforcement purpose). 13.

See 21 U.S.C. ? 853; see also Bruce J. Winick, Forfeiture of Attorneys' Fees Under RICO and CCE and the Right to Counsel of Choice: The Constitutional Dilemma and How to Avoid It, 43 U. Miami L. Rev. 765, 766-71 (1989) (providing a more thorough background on the advent and purpose of criminal forfeiture); see also 21 U.S.C. ? 853(n)(6)(B) (stating that federal forfeiture law contains a "bona fide purchaser" provision which provides that those without reasonable cause to believe that assets were subject to forfeiture may recoup losses; however, the burden is on the defendant and an acquittal of a criminal charge does not necessarily mean that a party victimized by a civil forfeiture will be able to regain property since an acquittal only means that the government has not established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt). 15.

Rev. 137, 145-46 (1995) ("Prior to 1970, forfeiture . . . was virtually unutilized in the federal system . . . [t]oday, forfeiture is one of the most powerful weapons in the government's arsenal, with over 100 statutes providing for the forfeiture of property implicated in criminal activity."). 16. See 21 U.S.C. ? 848(a)(2)(A) (requiring forfeiture of "profits" in CCE cases); compare with 18 U.S.C. ? 1963(a) (1970) (allowing jury determination of defendant's forfeitable "interest" in criminal proceeds in RICO cases); see also Forfeitures, 21 U.S.C. ? 881 (2002) (permitting the forfeiture of contraband). 17. The distinction between civil and criminal forfeiture under current American law is rather opaque, and it is often difficult to determine whether forfeiture constitutes a criminal penalty. Focusing on the subject matter of a particular case will not determine whether civil or criminal forfeiture is occurring. When faced with a criminal suspect in possession of ill-gained property, the government can elect to commence either civil or criminal forfeiture proceedings contingent on strategic concerns beyond the scope of this article. Adding to the complication are the various aspects of civil forfeiture that appear by common sense to be punishment or criminally related. For example, the "innocent owner" defense of civil forfeiture suggests that the alternative is a "guilty owner." This structure is a result of the fiction that in rem forfeiture is purely about the property itself, independent from its owner, which is necessary for the government to prevent criminal Bill of Rights protections (which apply to human beings only) from triggering.</page><page sequence="7">2009] FEDERAL FORFEITURE 49 time and moving right back into their tacky mansions, Congress reacted. It first passed the Comprehensive Forfeiture Act ("the CFA") in 1984.18 The CFA permitted the government to seek a restraining order on a defendant's assets before issuing an indict ment, borrowing the relation back fiction that title to property vests in the sovereign at the time of illegality.19 The unprece dented borrowing of a civil property fiction into the criminal law-an area with heavy Bill of Rights implications, including the reasonable doubt standard-would later have profound implications.20 Next, Congress passed the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 ("the MLCA") in an attempt to restrain the flow and conceal ment of drug trade proceeds, for the first time criminalizing activi ties of those who are knowingly involved in the flow of dirty money.21 Section 1956 of the MLCA criminalized conduct necessa rily related to concealing assets, whereas 1957 greatly expanded traditional notions of money laundering's definition, prohibiting "knowingly engag[ing] or attempt [ing] to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property . . . derived from speci fied unlawful activity."22 Given the connection between forfeiture and the new substantive money laundering offense, the Depart ment of Justice created a single unit within its Criminal Division, the Asset Forfeiture &amp; Money Laundering Section. Money laun dering was added to the list of crimes constituting a RICO offense and the money laundering statute was amended in 1988, allowing the government to seek forfeiture of all property "involved in" laundering.23 The circuits have split on how broadly to read the 18.

Some have adopted the "facilitation the ory," meaning that an entire bank account with one million dollars can be frozen upon the deposit of a few thousand dirty dollars, since the bulk of the account is being used to facilitate the conceal ment of the smaller amount.24 Other circuits have adopted a nar rower "substantial connection test," meaning that only the portions of the bank account substantially connected to the under lying crime may be frozen.25 It was initially feared that the expan sive reach of the money laundering statutes, casting a wide net to prevent sophisticated criminals aware of the loopholes that restrictively-written legislation provided, would lead to congres sionally unintended prosecutions.26 The only way to limit unin tended prosecutions and convictions in such a broadly worded statute is the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Given statutory vagueness, prosecutorial power is more or less unfettered. Addi tionally, the judicial determination of the reach of "involved in" has an impact not only upon alleged drug peddlers, but also upon those financially connected in a facially legitimate capacity, such as bankers and lawyers. The gross lack of uniformity in the realm of federal money laundering law's reach requires further clarifica tion by the Supreme Court, as the current lack of guidance serves as a tacit allowance of inconsistent and abusive practices by law enforcement. mechanisms for money laundering).

Attacking the System There is uncertainty on the issue of whether or not the federal forfeiture and money laundering statutes were intended to reach funds paid by criminal suspects to counsel for legal services. It is most likely that Congress either did not contemplate that forfei ture law would prohibit cash flow to legitimate defense services, or simply chose to defer to the federal courts.27 There is a footnote in an earlier draft of the 1984 forfeiture amendments that states "[n]othing in this section is intended to interfere with a person's sixth amendment right to counsel."28 Such intent offers little help since the Sixth Amendment is not a light switch that only Con gress can turn on or off; defining the contours of the right to coun sel is within the province of the federal courts, not Congress. Before passage of section 1957 of the money laundering statutes, there was much debate on whether to include a similar Sixth Amendment exemption clause.29 Congress ultimately decided, however, to forego the inclusion of such an exemption clause within the legislation.30 Nevertheless, at the behest of the Depart ment of Justice, after much lobbying by the NACDL, section 1957(h) was enacted: "monetary transaction . . . does not include any transaction necessary to preserve a person's right to represen tation as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitu tion."31 Section 1956, prohibiting money laundering in the traditional sense of concealment, contains no such clause. Although the forfeiture statutes do not directly address the Sixth Amendment question, some federal courts recognized that 853(c)'s bona fide purchaser clause had the potential to protect 27.

There were also varying interpretations of how to handle the constitutionally cogent question of how to approach situations where pre-conviction criminal forfeiture restraining orders prevented defendants from hiring private defense counsel. The Fourth Circuit opined on this matter by consolidating three cases in 1987: Harvey, Bassett and Caplin &amp; Drysdale.34 In affirming the lower court and recognizing the special expertise that trial courts have on the real-life detriments imposed on crimi nal suspects denied the power to hire counsel via ex parte forfei ture, the court held that criminal forfeiture was intended to reach pre-conviction restraints on transfers to pay legitimate attorney's fees, but also held that this practice violated defendants' constitu tional right to counsel of choice.35 Additionally, the court reasoned that when the right to counsel of choice is violated, prejudice is presumed not because public defenders are inherently incompe tent, but because choice of counsel has been denied.36 It was also ruled that pre-conviction forfeiture violated due process where the defendant is denied a hearing to challenge the propriety of restraints.37 Faced with a similar factual setting, the Eleventh Circuit held otherwise, valuing the statutory relation back fiction above the original intent of the rights to counsel and due process.38 Valuing the fiction above all else enabled the court to reason that a defendant does not have a right to use assets that no longer belong to him, and instead belong to the government, to hire coun 32.

The government sought and received a section 853 restraining order from the dis trict court on Monsanto's apartment and $35,000 based on reason able suspicion that they derived from criminal acts.43 Defendant challenged the district court order because of his inability to hire counsel of choice, and the Second Circuit "agree[d] that any such fees paid to Monsanto's defense counsel [were] exempt from subse quent forfeiture."44 On appeal, the Supreme Court rejected the argument of the Second Circuit, bowing to Congress's power to codify the relation back fiction.

First of all, the petitioner was a law firm seeking payment for represent ing a client facing CCE charges, not a criminal defendant with heightened procedural protections; second, the firm was seeking payment for services rendered after the client had already pled guilty and was therefore on notice that assets were forfeitable.50 The circumstances of the case suggest that the Court's holding may be limited to its particular facts. Justice White, joined by the same four justices as in Monsanto,51 held that section 853, contain ing a codification of the relation back fiction and providing no express Sixth Amendment exemption, did not violate defendants' constitutional right to counsel of choice.52 Secondly, reasoning that the scope of due process is limited independent of the right to counsel, the Court chose not to strike down the statute via the 45.

The Court would have been unable to reason that a "defendant has no Sixth Amendment right to spend another person's money" for legal services without the logical predicate that the defendant, although not yet convicted, lost the right to transfer his assets upon the commission of his supposed crime.55 Agreeing with the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning in Bissell,56 appointed counsel was deemed sufficient to satisfy the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights where forfeiture rendered the defendant a pauper.57 Siding with the government, the Court declared that sophisticated pri vate counsel is just another strong weapon the enemy holds in the war on drugs.58 Adoption of such a view by the Court necessarily ignores the role private counsel hold as guardians of the criminal adversary process. The codification of the relation back fiction and the Court's affirmance of its legal validity in Monsanto and Captin &amp; Drysdale have not since been called into question by the Supreme Court and should be understood to be the law of the land at present date.59 If Captin &amp; Drysdale resulted in an adverse financial impact on the criminal defense bar, the prosecution of defense attorneys for money laundering has had a downright frightening one.

An allegedly corrupt attorney can also be prosecuted for "traditional" concealment (section 1956 money laundering), which can appear in tandem with a 1957 charge.62 Miami defense attorney Benedict Kuehne was indicted for, inter alia, sections 1956(a)(l)(B)(i), knowingly concealing the pro ceeds of unlawful activity, 1956(a)(2)(B)(i), importing these pro ceeds from a foreign country, specifically Colombia, as well as 1957, engaging in monetary transactions constituting criminally derived property.63 This is the first indictment under the federal money laundering statutes of an attorney for vetting, or perform ing due diligence on, another lawyer's legal fees. It is also a key case for determining the extent to which Monsanto and Captin &amp; Drysdale can be used by prosecutors to extend liability to practi tioners.

Rutgard, rather than Eleventh Circuit precedent.81 Additionally, it is uncommon for a district court to grant a defendant the dismissal of a count established to be an affirmative defense. Notwithstanding the status of the 1957 dis missal, it is likely that Kuehne will stand trial for the 1956 charge. The result of the case likely hinges on mens rea, as Kuehne will argue that he did not know that the funds were tainted, since the fact that they were appears conclusive.82 Never theless, Judge Cooke's rejection of the government's common argument that Captin &amp; Drysdale has "vitiated" the Sixth Amend laundering-indicment/ ("Judge Cooke found that Kuehne could not be prosecuted because the funds were for legitimate legal services."). 78.

C. Prosecutorial Tactics To understand the origins of the Kuehne indictment, it is helpful to analyze sections of the United States Attorneys' Man ual, containing the policies and procedures followed by federal prosecutors, involving forfeiture and money laundering.84 Although the manual has no binding force and there is no cause of action or legal claim for the government's failure to follow its pro cedures, it strongly guides prosecutorial decisions. The manual outlines a variety of consultation and notification requirements between federal prosecutor branches and Washington "[i]n light of the scope of the money laundering statutes" for the sake of "the orderly development of the case law and . . . [application of] these statutes in a consistent manner."85 Section 9-105.600, titled "Pros ecution Standards?Bona Fide Fees Paid to Attorneys for Repre sentation in a Criminal Matter," contains such a consultation safeguard and sheds some light on the controversial Kuehne mat ter.86 The manual directs prosecutors to perform their duties with the understanding that 1957(f)'s Sixth Amendment exemption is "extremely limited"87 Relying on the relation back fiction, this sec tion cites Captin &amp; Drysdale to remind that "there is no Sixth Amendment right to use criminally derived property to retain counsel of choice in a criminal case" and that a conviction or plea is not necessary in determining which property is and is not "crim inally derived."88 Closely applicable to the Kuehne matter, this section also states that: [T]he Department, as a matter of policy, will not prosecute 83.

However, the definition of "bona fide fees" excludes fees subject to forfeiture under the relation back fiction. Even if a defense attor ney has a subjective belief in the innocence of his or her client or thinks that the government should bear the burden of persuasion, fees can still be not "bona fide" and are therefore subject to forfei ture. Moreover, the scope of what information can be gained from the client by a defense attorney during the course of representa tion without exposure to a money laundering charge and the extent of attorney-client privilege is ill-defined and open to vary ing interpretation, particularly with relation back in effect. In regards to pre-indictment, pre-conviction criminal forfei ture, section 9-111.130 mandates that "the United States Attorney will ensure proper and timely pre-indictment coordination with the United States Marshals Service to prepare for and assess the property management and financial needs of those assets subject to criminal forfeiture."90 Section 9-111.600 requires that "[s]eized cash [including assets with which a defendant intends to retain counsel], except where it is to be used as evidence91 is to be depos ited promptly in the Seized Asset Deposit Fund ("SADF") pending forfeiture."92 Governmental use of funds in the SADF is intended to "prevent crime, enforce Federal laws and represent the rights and interests of the American people."93 The amount of assets 89.

This circumvents instances where a defense attorney holds a genuine subjective belief that his client will beat the charges and that ultimately assets will not be forfeitable through sleight of hand. This is contrary to Professor Winick's opinion that Congress intended that the phrase "reason ably without cause to believe that the property was subject to for feiture" would connote "bounded by reason" and that extension of this to defense attorneys in instances of legitimate attorney's fees is out of bounds.102 The United States Attorneys' Manual on forfei ture and money laundering could be improved103 if the Depart ment of Justice is sincerely interested in restoring defendants' constitutional rights and working within the parameters of the law;104 however, the manual does put defense attorneys on notice of current prosecutorial practices and procedures, contrary to com plaints of lack of notice by the defense bar.105 Whatever the government's true goals are regarding the power to choose whether they face private or court-appointed counsel to represent a defendant, prosecutors do hold the power to render a defendant a pauper via forfeiture and may dissuade pri vate attorneys from taking cases for fear of a money laundering indictment.106 In United States v.

Defend ing RICO and other complex conspiracy cases with multiple charges and defendants is time-consuming, labor-intensive and necessarily expensive. Certain federal public defender's offices are adequately staffed and may liberally apply to receive further funding.108 Federal public defenders are often skilled, energetic and hard-working, but the Supreme Court has noted that there is no substitute for experienced private defense counsel, particularly in trial work.109 Yet another grave problem is that federal pre-conviction for feiture has enabled parallel state laws.110 Florida and similarly situated states simply cannot adequately fund their public defender's offices, causing them to turn back clients.111 This researcher saw this phenomenon firsthand during the summer of 2008: the Miami public defender's office, with a 400-felony-a-year caseload, was forced to deny clients representation while pleading to Tallahassee for more aid.112 Notwithstanding arguments that forfeiture has a chilling effect on defendants' Sixth Amendment rights to counsel of choice, many state public defender's offices simply cannot shoulder the heavy burden that forfeiture has placed on them.

The original intent interpretation is the best among the alternatives if judges are to strive for objectiv ity in the blind administration of justice; indeed, "[t]he Court can act as a legal rather than a political institution only if it is neutral . . . in the way it derives and defines the principles it applies."117 The legislature operates and serves the American people through majority rule, but "[t]he only thing majorities may not do is invade the liberties the Constitution specifies."118 The most important function of the Constitution, specifically the Bill of Rights, is to serve as a check on majority abuses against the minority. A judge "must apply [the Constitution] consistently and without regard to his sympathy or lack of sympathy with the parties before him," even if the judge perceives the party before it as a reprehensible drug smuggler or ethically questionable law firm.119 The pursuit of objectivity and neutrality in principal is crucial if the law is to have any true legitimacy and if the federal courts are to be a neu tral and non-political branch, as the framers intended. Original intent critics commonly argue that the framers did not envision modern constructs, such as the growth of a massive international drug trade, which would debilitate the health, safety and economic condition of the nation, so our interpretation of the document must change with the times.

To say that the Constitution constantly changes as the values surrounding it do is simplistic, non-objective and cheapens stare decisis. If the Consti tution rewrites itself as we do, there would be over 300,000,000 Constitutions; if it progresses as our social norms do, then justices are given the power to define what is progress and what is regress, yet policy is clearly in the legislature's domain. Critics argue that original intent interpretation is often too strictly textual, narrow and inert, but this is not the case. Textual and original intent interpretations are distinct; for example, the "right to privacy" is not textually apparent in the document, yet it screams from every inch of negative space therein. Similarly, the framers did not envision the use of thermovision technology by law enforcement to look inside homes and apprehend citizens engaged in illegal activ ity, yet the Court in Kyllo correctly inferred that the framers would not have allowed such a gross invasion into the home with out a warrant.120 Lastly, the Constitution and the Court's duty is strongest where core rights are infringed121 rather than when rights are expanded,122 if the highest body of law is to be under stood, as it was and should be, primarily as a safeguard for the trampled-on few. There is a right and wrong way to interpret the Constitution. It is difficult to excuse Supreme Court decisions that have resulted in twenty years of unconstitutional violations against the minority. Future courts should not feel confined to obey the dic tates of these cases. Stare decisis is important for consistency and the development of doctrine, but it cannot be "an ironclad rule"123 unless one operates under the assumption that justices are always faithful to the Constitution: "[i]t is . . . not only [the Court's] pre rogative but also [its] duty to re-examine a precedent where its reasoning or understanding of the Constitution is fairly called into 120.

Therefore, the Court's duty to protect the minority becomes even more critical. The Caplin &amp; Drysdale and Monsanto majority bloc was obsessed with the war on drugs, clouding their application of America's most important legal document.126 Instead of allowing temporary restraining orders on a pre-convicted party's assets even where a defendant intends to hire a defense lawyer, there should be a permanent restraining order between politics and law. The majority either adopted the belief that the Court is a "naked power organ"127 (knowing a priori what is best for society) or overestimated public apathy when stating in Caplin &amp; Drys dale that the codification of the relation back fiction within section 853(c) "reflects the application of the long-recognized and lawful practice of vesting title to any forfeitable assets, in the United States, at the time of the criminal act . . . ."128 The lack of legal citation in this portion has less to do with trifling clerks and instead reflects the lack of legal foundation for extending the rela tion back fiction, and with it the concepts of in rem forfeiture, to the criminal arena. Justice White does rely on Stowell, a 1890 case in which a distillery was forfeited to the government in viola tion of the Internal Revenue Code. However, the forfeiture at issue in Stowell was not open to the same constitutional scrutiny as it related solely to taxes and property interests; the Stowell defendant did not, and could not, seek to invalidate the forfeiture statute at issue under an assertion of personal Bill of Rights viola tions since his liberty was not at stake.129 Moreover, the govern 124.

Without Stowell, the only leg White has to stand on is "a strong governmental interest"130-rhetoric which cannot seriously be regarded as solid constitutional analy sis weighed against severe governmental intrusions. If the relation back fiction is indeed "long-recognized," it is peculiar that Supreme Court justices could have been confused as to its true mechanics in a 1993 in rent forfeiture case, 92 Buena Vista.131 The case involved the civil forfeiture of real estate that was allegedly bought with drug proceeds and the Supreme Court granted certiorari to clarify forfeiture mechanics and property ownership.132 The 92 Buena Vista plurality could not reach a con sensus on when exactly title in the forfeitable property vests in the government.133 The concept is also not well-established, as courts in the past century have aimed to limit the unfair effects of the relation back theory, even in the purely civil in rem area, not withstanding its extension in the criminal law where there are more procedural protections for defendants.134 Other commenta tors have searched for instances of the utilization of relation back doctrine in criminally related cases, but to no avail; it is "an inno vation virtually without precedent in American law."135 If relation back has no foundation in American law, perhaps it has some basis in British law, which heavily influenced the train ers' minds. However, an investigation of British law produces no such result; the criminal relation back fiction is purely an Ameri can innovation, established circa 1984.136 Decisions out of Great Britain indicate that criminals have, and have always had, at 130.

Chief Constable, the Royal Court of Justice held that money seized on suspicion of it being the proceeds of drug traffick ing must be returned to the individual from which it was seized when the purpose for which it was seized no longer applies.139 Although the police argued that they were holding the proceeds until the true owner was identified, the court reasoned that the alleged drug dealer was entitled to recoup his losses "if, he could establish his title without relying on his own illegality, even if it emerged that the title on which he relied was acquired in the course of carrying through an illegal transaction."140 This ruling was made despite the police's strong possessory and policy-based interests, in stark contrast to the majority's reasoning in Captin &amp; Drysdale. In Attorney General v. Blake, a case involving an author's right to the proceeds of a biography chronicling "a self confessed traitor's" time spent as a secret Soviet agent operating within Britain, the House of Lords relied on centuries-old common law property concepts and refused to apply the 1911 Official Secrets Act. That Act states that "the Attorney General is entitled to intervene by instituting civil proceedings, in aid of the criminal law, to uphold the public policy of ensuring that a criminal does not retain profit directly derived from the commission of his crime."141 In Blake, the House of Lords admonished a "dearth of judicial decision" on the books on the matter of property vesting in the Crown at the time an offense is committed, even in a serious circumstance such as treason.142 In the United States, the framers 137.

Without any reliable legal or historical support, the relation back fiction and ? 853 forfeiture, also codified within the federal money laundering statutes, must fail. As a society committed to constitutional principles, we should be "deeply concerned about the prosecution's trailblazing use of forfeiture to cripple the accused before the trial has even started."144 As Justice Blackmun pointed out in the Caplin &amp; Drysdale dissent, "[t]he notion that the Government has a legitimate interest in depriving criminals-?e/?re they are convicted-of economic power ... is more than just somewhat unsettling .... [it] is constitutionally sus pect."145 Since the relation back fiction is a fictitious toothpick supporting undue governmental power over the minority, ipso facto, we must proceed without recognition of it. B. Fifth Amendment Due Process The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires that "[n]o person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."146 Modern fed eral forfeiture and money laundering law violates due process on five grounds: nullifying the presumption of innocence, failing to require that prosecutors prove every element beyond a reasonable doubt given a judicial misunderstanding of subjective mens rea, failing to provide adequate hearings to defendants, unjustly tilt ing the overall adversarial balance of fairness in favor of the gov ernment, and inserting civil in rem concepts like the relation back fiction into the criminal law. Our criminal justice system is based on the all-important pre sumption of innocence, but the old adage that it is better to let ten guilty people go free than to convict one innocent has been forgot ten.

In it, the Court ruled that laying within the very foundation of criminal law and due process was the presumption of innocence as well as the requirement that the prosecution bear the burden of proving every element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.147 Pre-conviction forfeiture, by distorting civil law concepts and misplacing them within the crim inal law, assumes that the defendant is presumed guilty before being assessed by a jury of his peers. What right does a bank rob ber have to use stolen money to hire a lawyer?148 None, but before the robber is convicted, he is a suspected bank robber, and the money is only allegedly stolen. Winship and hundreds of years of the development of our law requires us to think this way. Fur ther, the bank robber is "dissipating the actual property of others, whereas the suspected drug dealer who spends profits from alleg edly illegal drug activity is not interfering with the property inter ests of other persons" and therefore has superior claim of title.149 Lastly, the bank robber often steals bills specially marked by the bank, or has been caught red-handed outside of the bank, giving law enforcement probable cause to lawfully seize the assets as evi dence with a Fourth Amendment seizure. Shifting focus to attorneys, Justice White relied on Laska to argue that "[n]o lawyer, in any case,... has the right to ... accept stolen property, or . . . ransom money, in payment of a fee ... . The privilege to practice law is not a license to steal."150 This is true, but only after a judicial declaration that the money was sto len, via a plea bargain or conviction. The "privilege to practice law" involves a duty to fight vigorously on behalf of a client that is presumed innocent. The relation back fiction gave the Captin &amp; Drysdale and Monsanto majorities license to utilize a broader scope of cases that never violated the presumption of innocence as grossly as pre-conviction forfeiture of a criminal defendant's assets did. Prosecutors must, and courts must see to it that they do, prove that the defendant's conduct has met every element of the 147. See generally In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970). 148.

In order for the government to bring a money laundering charge against an attorney for accepting tainted fees from a client, prose cutors must hold reasonable belief that the attorney had subjec tive actual knowledge of the fees' taint.152 With the foresight that absurdity may ensue given the breadth of liability that federal money laundering permits, the NACDL successfully lobbied Con gress to insert the "knowing" mens rea for money laundering. Unfortunately, the courts have strayed from a proper application of the "knowing" mens rea.153 The federal courts, and the United States Attorneys' Manual, claim to have adopted the definition of "knowing" as specified in the Model Penal Code154 and the Ninth Circuit case Jewell.155 Judicial misunderstanding of "knowing," particularly in 1957 money laundering prosecutions, can result in a miscarriage of justice, and such a miscarriage was present in Campbell, a case out of the Fourth Circuit.156 In Campbell, a real estate agent was tried and convicted for money laundering after selling a home to a man who may have appeared to be a drug dealer: he drove a Porsche, flashed large wads of cash, used a cel lular phone and drank beer during normal business hours in front of the agent.157 The trial court rightly set aside the verdict, rea 151.

The court improperly applied its own prejudices instead of carefully examin ing the scant evidence of the real estate agent's knowledge at the time the offense occurred.160 Should a similar broken analytical mode be employed in the Kuehne matter, or in any subsequent money laundering prosecutions of those whose job title requires contact with tainted funds (i.e. bankers, real estate agents and lawyers), due process will be violated. Lastly, it is worth recalling that, according to the United States Attorneys' Manual, prosecu tors have the power to impose subjective knowledge of a client's tainted assets by issuing an indictment against the client; such an assumption also violates due process, particularly when the law yer has a subjective actual belief that his client will beat the charges.161 Defendants facing ex parte pre-conviction criminal forfeiture are commonly not afforded a forum to challenge the forfeiture. This practice violates due process, particularly after we dispose of the relation back fiction.162 In the seminal due process for adver sarial hearings case, Matthews v.

To no avail, appellants in Bissell argued that "when pretrial restraints are imposed on assets, the Fifth Amendment requires a hearing on the merits at which the government must prove the probability that the defendant will be convicted and that his assets will be forfeited."166 Such an argument is entirely reasona ble and consistent with the Eldridge factors, yet the appellate court felt that defendant did not deserve a "full-blown hearing . . . in light of the government's compelling regulatory interest in preventing crime."167 While the government does have a strong regulatory interest, the Eleventh Circuit did not put much weight on defendant's right to a "full blown hearing" during a meaningful interaction with the government with property, and by extension, liberty at stake. As to the erroneous deprivation prong, the Bissell court conceded that "[t]he clear danger posed by this statutory scheme [of pre-conviction forfeiture of assets connected to funda mental Bill of Rights protections] is the possibility that perfectly legitimate assets will be wrongfully restrained."168 By depending on the relation back fiction, the court did not have to fully apply Eldridge from the viewpoint of the defendant since "when two par ties [the presumptively innocent defendant and the government] have property rights in contested assets, a due process analysis must comprehend both interests."169 The next year, when the Supreme Court decided Monsanto and Captin &amp; Drysdale, the Court offered little procedural guidance to lower federal courts, thereby endorsing draconian procedures such as those outlined by 164.

Although the following has not gained vast support because of judicial deference to governmental policy interests, it is worth set ting forth the argument that federal forfeiture and money laun dering laws have unfairly tipped the tenuous adversarial balance in favor of the government, violating due process. Prosecutors are given considerable leeway in attaching a criminal forfeiture charge to various federal charges, influencing plea negotiations and impinging on the authority to determine who defense counsel will be, public or private.174 Even the Bissell court recognized that section 853 forfeiture permitted prosecutorial abuses by "seek[ing] broad, sweeping restraints recklessly or intentionally encompass ing legitimate, nonindictable assets."175 Prosecutors are, and should be, vested with discretion and be presumed to act in good faith to issue indictments with the public's best interest in mind, but with broadly worded federal statutes at their disposal, the opportunity for abuse is heightened.176 170.

Due process provides courts a tool to analyze the general fairness of statutes; it also requires notification of charges, an opportunity for a hearing, well-articulated and non vague charges, charges that are credibly based, the presumption of innocence and requirement that the government prove every element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt. These and other basic criminal procedural guarantees have little or no relation to the Sixth Amendment. Criminal defendants' access to due process may be inhibited by conflicts of interest faced by defense attorneys given RICO and the MLCA's breadth, exacerbated through money laundering prosecutions of attorneys.179 Defense attorneys are ethically obli gated to vigorously represent clients, necessitating research into a client's background to be sure that no material stone is left unturned in preparing a defense.180 Information gathered by defense attorneys through client interviews and possibly incrimi nating evidence gathered through independent investigation are private and protected by attorney-client privilege and the right to counsel.181 However, this sacred privilege is abrogated by the "crime-fraud" exception to the attorney-client privilege, which 177.

Lastly, the insertion of civil law fictions into the criminal law necessarily violates due process since criminal law should be care fully crafted to prevent constitutional abuses under the due pro cess clause. In rem forfeiture's mechanics have been inserted into in personam forfeiture via pre-conviction restraining order provi sions.188 In rem forfeiture relies on the assumption that the prop erty itself, quite apart from its owner, is guilty and that the state must take or restrain it for the public safety and welfare.189 Nearly all property in the United States and other capitalist locales are owned by individuals or corporations (legally individu als), and this deprivation in property directly punishes the owner. Just as we would cast aside a law stating: "the government shall satisfy that a criminal defendant has committed this crime by a preponderance of evidence," it is equally misguided to extend civil procedural rules relating to forfeiture extending to the criminal law. Even the United States Attorneys' Manual recognizes that human parties are connected to, and punished in conjunction with, their property.190 Further, the "innocent owner" and "bona fide purchaser" provisions implicitly recognize the alternative: there is a guilty owner, or illegitimate purchaser at which the for feiture laws are directed.191 The courts have allowed a fiction that belittles basic property rights despite due process concerns to aid the government in the war on drugs and violence. The Fifth (and Fourth) Amendments were ratified because the framers and the states valued the connection between people and their property, and the importance of preventing invasive governmental intru sions on personal property rights. 188. See supra Part ILA. 189. See Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617, 638 n.5 (1989), (Blackmun, J., dissentingX'The theory (or, more properly, the fiction) underlying civil forfeiture is that the property subject to forfeiture is itself tainted by having been used in an unlawful manner .... Criminal forfeiture, in contrast, is penal in nature: it is predicated on the adjudicated guilt of the defendant, and has punishment of the defendant as its express purpose .... Where the purpose of forfeiture is to punish the defendant, the Government's penal interest are weakest when the punishment also burdens third parties."). 190.

Fourth Amendment Seizure The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires that The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affir mation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.192 Forfeiture is seizure.193 Fair probable cause adversarial hearings should precede all pre-conviction forfeitures of a defendant's prop erty in order to ensure the reasonableness that the Fourth Amendment unequivocally mandates. Professor Bascuas recently set forth that pre-conviction forfeiture should be challenged on Fourth Amendment grounds, even though the battle has previ ously been fought, as in Monsanto, Captin &amp; Drysdale, and Bissell on a Sixth Amendment field.194 Bascuas's argument pinpoints the anomaly that even though "the government cannot remove an allegedly obscene book from circulation before proving that it is obscene, under current law it can prevent an accused from using contested assets to fund his defense with little more than an alle gation."195 In pre-conviction forfeiture scenarios, a defendant should at least be granted the same procedural protections uni formly offered in seizure hearings. Additionally, focusing on for feiture as seizure limits forfeitable property to that which is evidence of a crime, thus limiting the expansive reach of forfeiture allowed under the facilitation theory. The lack of a considerable shift into this area in the law is due in large part to the error of defense attorneys who have framed the issue within the Sixth Amendment; then again, hindsight is 20/20. Courts have likely viewed this approach as a self-interested fee-grab, instead of plac ing attention back where it should be, on the rights of the accused. D.

Despite an obligation to interpret and carefully consider the constitutionality of federal statutes, in Monsanto, the majority refused to recognize the right to counsel's special sta tus.197 Adopting a balancing test, the ultimate tool for a justice whose ultimate decision precedes impartial analysis, the majority concluded that "we find that a pretrial restraining order does not arbitrarily interfere with a defendant's fair opportunity to retain counsel."198 The disagreement between the five-member majority and the civil libertarians challenging the forfeiture laws in Monsanto and Captin &amp; Drysdale splintered on deference to the relation back fiction. In reality, pre-conviction forfeiture disrupts a presump tively innocent defendant's right to counsel of choice by restricting access to presumptively legitimate assets. However, utilizing the fiction, the majority reasoned that a defendant has no right to use someone else's (the government's) assets to hire counsel.199 The framers of the Constitution primarily intended to protect the right to choice of counsel: "the colonists would have been shocked at the notion that a defendant could be deprived of the right to retain his own counsel and instead ordered to stand trial with counsel appointed by the court."200 Zenger, a case involving a colonial pub lisher accused of printing and distributing libelous anti-govern 196.

When Zenger's counsel of choice, Andrew Hamil ton, appeared instead of the appointed lawyer, the judge was "startled" but permitted Hamilton's argument on the fundamental right to speak out against tyranny and censorship.202 The judge's permission of Hamilton to represent and argue on behalf of Zenger suggests that colonists valued counsel of choice and free speech, and aimed to prevent one-sided "mock" trials. In Flanagan, the Court reasoned that the right to choice of counsel "reflects constitutional protection of the defendant's free choice independent of concern for the objective fairness of the pro ceeding."203 The right to choice of counsel has needlessly receded ever since Gideon, which intended to supplement the right to counsel by affording certain defendants appointed counsel, not supplant the right to choice of counsel for those with means.204 This confused modern conception is typified by Justice Rehnquist in Wheat: "the essential aim ... is to guarantee an effective advo cate for each criminal defendant rather than to ensure that a defendant will inexorably be represented by the lawyer whom he prefers."205 The right to appointed counsel and counsel of choice need not be mutually exclusive, but there is a danger that the right to appointed counsel will swallow the right to choice of coun sel since the right to appointed counsel is more commonly dis cussed, exercised, and litigated. Justice Blackmun, in the Monsanto and Captin &amp; Drysdale dissent, struck the right chord, harkening back to the same values espoused in Zenger: "[t]hat the majority implicitly finds the Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice so insubstantial that it can be outweighed by a legal fiction demonstrates ... its apparent unawareness of the function of the 201.

The Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel has two prongs: deficiency and prejudice.207 To reverse a convic tion, a defendant must demonstrate that counsel was deficient (that counsel was not an effective legal advocate) and that he was prejudiced (the outcome of the case was affected by deficient coun sel).208 Broad leeway is given to defense counsel's strategic deci sions and claims are most often directed at overworked appointed counsel - ineffective assistance of counsel claims rarely prevail. Petitioner Monsanto argued that denial of counsel of choice resulted in ineffective assistance of counsel.209 By applying the modern conception of the right at the expense of the original meaning, Justice White did not properly entertain defendants' argument, responding that appointed counsel is not necessarily ineffective.210 An incomplete understanding of the right to counsel allowed the Monsanto majority to sidestep a coherent argument firmly rooted in the Sixth Amendment. E. First Amendment Speech The First Amendment to the United States Constitution requires that "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the free dom of speech."211 Criminal defendants are guaranteed the right to free speech. This right is of ultimate importance to a criminal defendant trying to defend him or herself. In the critical forum of a courtroom, all criminal defendants hold a First Amendment 206.

When counsel of choice is deprived, the First Amendment freedoms of speech and expression should therefore apply, triggering "exacting scrutiny review."212 F. Eighth Amendment Fines The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires that "[e]xcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed . . . ."213 Since recent in rem cases have revived the long idle prohibition against excessive fines, this concept should be extended to in personam criminal forfeiture as well. A fine has been defined by the Court as a "payment to a sovereign as punish ment for some offense."214 When assets allegedly related to a crime are transferred from a person to the government before adjudication by plea or conviction, the transfer should therefore be viewed as a "fine." Forfeiture as a result of money laundering depends on the use of "facilitation theory" - that otherwise clean assets are used to facilitate the concealment of tainted funds and that the clean funds are therefore forfeitable.215 This theory has also been used in the civil forfeiture context. For example, in Calero-Toledo, a case involving the forfeiture of a yacht upon law enforcement's retrieval of trace marijuana for personal use, the Supreme Court ruled that the entire yacht was forfeitable on the ground that it was connected to drug activity.216 The Eleventh Cir cuit has similarly ruled that "a vehicle is subject to forfeiture no matter how small the quantity of contraband found."217 The rule is "admittedly harsh," but the Sixth Circuit also allowed the forfei ture of a new Mercedes upon the discovery of the remains of four marijuana "cigarettes" on the dashboard.218 In the context of money laundering offenses, federal courts have ruled that prop erty facilitating money laundering offenses through concealment may be forfeited, despite a lack of the word "facilitate" within the criminal forfeiture statute. What is worse, forfeiture may be 212.

The Canadian Impact A. Background: the Canadian Legal System It is next appropriate to consider the deleterious effects cur rent American forfeiture law has had on Canada. In the past ten years, Canadian provinces have adopted the many questionable features of American forfeiture law, even though the Canadian legal system is structured quite differently than its neighbor to the south. Cloaked in the common law tradition and navigating a power balance between local and federal legal powers, the Cana dian legal system does have similarities with the United States.227 However, in the Canadian federalism construction, the criminal law is clearly delegated to the federal government, whereas civil and property law is left exclusively to the provinces.228 There exists a movement for uniformity in Canadian civil law, and Onta rio has typically served as the focal point of legal change within Canada. Ontario, in turn, tends to look for guidance from and con formity with the outside world.229 Unlike the closed system employed in the United States, Canadian courts often rely on international precedent, primarily from Britain and the United States, as well as international treaties.230 Although still techni cally connected to Great Britain, The British North America Act of 1867 granted Canada leeway in crafting its own laws, and in 1982 the Canadian Charter of Rights of Freedoms ("the Charter") was enacted, containing striking similarities with the American Bill of Rights.231 The Charter enumerates guaranteed freedoms, includ 227.

Oakes involved a suc cessful challenge to a statute that stated simple possession of drugs necessarily led to a presumption of full blown trafficking. The Canadian Supreme Court ruled that this violated section 11(d), presumption of innocence; just as such a provision would likely violate American Due Process.235 Once a challenger has demonstrated that the Charter has been violated, the burden shifts and the Crown must prove by a "preponderance of the probabilities" that 1) the purpose of the measure constraining the Charter right is sufficiently important and consistent with a free and democratic society; 2) the means chosen to constrain the Charter right are proportional; and 3) there is proportionality between the effects and purposes of the measure.236 Since current Canadian forfeiture laws are provincial and therefore technically civil in scope, the Canadian courts have not been given the oppor tunity to fully consider the Charter rights implicated by forfeiture in the criminal context, which like the American Bill of Rights is heightened for criminal defendants.

Provincial Forfeiture Law At the federal, criminal level, section 462.37 permits the Crown to order a forfeiture of any "proceeds of crime" after convic tion as a part of sentencing, and the court is required to order forfeiture of any property involving criminal property or property "connected to" the offense by a balance of probabilities.237 If the federal court is satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the con tested assets are proceeds of crime, it may issue a forfeiture order notwithstanding insufficient evidence linking the property to the specific offense with which the individual has been charged. The Canadian equivalent to American federal money laundering is contained in section 462.31, punishing every one "who uses, [or] transfers the possession of. . . any property or any proceeds of the property with intent to conceal or convert that property or those proceeds, knowing or believing that all or a part of that property or of those proceeds" originate from illegal activity.238 Upon exam ination of the language and substance of this definition, it is apparent that Canada has borrowed the American "facilitation theory" law enforcement tool and has set mens rea at "knowingly," as in the United States.239 Further, the government may seek a pre-conviction restraint on a defendant's assets. Lastly, the Cana dian money laundering statute contains no express section 10 right to counsel provision; such an exemption would have little effect as the right to counsel is substantively narrow in Canada.240 It was not until December 2001 that Ontario, following the enforcement lead of other common law countries, began utilizing "civil" forfeiture with the Civil Remedies Act of 2001 ("CRA").241 The CRA aimed to cripple organized crime, marijuana grow houses, and urban blight.242 The CRA borrows heavily from Amer 237.

Further, a "responsible owner" (similar to the American "innocent owner" or "bona fide purchaser"), may move to recoup lost property, and the court must honor that motion upon a finding of credibility.248 Although Canadian civil forfeiture arguably intrudes on the fed eral domain, it exemplifies "double aspect" provincial law, which touches, but is not classified as, criminal law.249 This arguably unconstitutional phenomenon seems to linger when the federal government is complicit with provincial intrusions into the fed eral, criminal domain. This feature is not so different from the greatly increased federal criminal power after RICO's passage: federalism problems are not "problems" when the federal and local governments share crime-fighting interests.

Both mechanisms permit asset forfeiture upon "reasonable grounds" of illegality, both aim to aid victims and compensate the government for its efforts, and both funnel allegedly ill-gotten gains to further new law enforcement objec tives. As in the United States, there has been ample criticism by civil libertarians in Canada.257 Canadian critics, like their Ameri can neighbors, fear that otherwise innocent third parties, such as landlords who rent to tenants who may misuse apartments to grow marijuana, will suffer financially. Critics also fear the Attor ney General's prediction of "exponential growth" in the area and 250.

Perhaps the most striking distinction is that Canadian law enforcement nearly always avoids civil forfeiture contemporane ous with a criminal proceeding; typically, civil forfeiture actions commence only after the criminal process has been exhausted or ignored.260 This is a strategic decision by the provinces since the validity of their forfeiture rests on its "civil" aspects. If decreed criminal in nature, there is fear by the government that forfeited assets will have to be returned and the laws will be struck down as unconstitutional.261 C. Chatterjee: Civil Law by Contortion On March 27, 2003, Robin Chatterjee was driving when Onta rio police pulled him over because his car was missing a front license plate.262 Officers detected the odor of marijuana and searched his car, finding a light socket, light ballast, an exhaust fan (equipment commonly associated with growing marijuana), and $29,020 CAD.263 Although he was "in breach of his recogni zance, which required him to reside in Ottawa,"264 and there was apparent probable cause of drug activity, police did not charge Chatterjee with a criminal offense due to "lack of evidence," but seized the grow equipment and cash as instruments of unlawful activity.265 Chatterjee challenged the seizure in the Superior 258.

The court further reasoned that forfeiture is not punishment since there is no deprivation of liberty or stigma attached to forfeiture; further, the CRA fell "squarely" within provincial power as related to property and civil rights.280 Applying the all-important double aspect theory, the court reasoned that civil law "may intrude into some areas that can normally be in the domain of the criminal law, namely, promoting public peace, order, security, health and morality" but that these effects are only "incidental to its pur pose."281 Lastly, addressing the presumption of innocence viola tion argument, the court reasoned that the guilt or innocence of the owner is irrelevant, so there was no violation.282 There are compelling arguments to the contrary. Specifically, consistent with the releases by the Ontario and British Columbia Attorneys General, the legislation is aimed at stopping the drug trade and organized crime, and those who stand to lose are the class of citizens typically targeted in the criminal law. Although Canadian authorities do not typically bring concurrent civil forfei ture and criminal charges but wait until after the criminal pro ceedings are concluded, or, as in Chatterjee, bring no criminal charges at all, the very fact that they could proves that the types of behavior addressed in the civil forfeiture laws are criminal. As would be the case in most American courts unfortunately, no seri ous consideration was given to the fact that $29,020 CAD was seized outside the criminal process despite the ample evidence that it originated from the criminal activity of an individual.

The bleakest aspect of oral argument was that the Canadian Supreme Court Justices' questions focused on social pol icy aspects of the legislation; this was troubling to appellants because the federal government is in the province's corner and striking down the legislation would likely result in the adminis trative nightmare of a redistribution of forfeited assets, as well as halt a much needed flow of cash to provincial law enforcement.288 It was hardly a surprise when, on April 17, 2009, the Cana dian Supreme Court sided with the provincial and federal govern ment by unanimously affirming the Court of Appeal for Ontario.289 Echoing the lower court, the Canadian Supreme Court discredited Chatterjee's case as based on "an exaggerated view of the immu nity of federal jurisdiction in relation to matters of criminal that may, in another aspect, be the subject of provincial legislation."290 By framing the issue as the provinces' power to regulate health and welfare rather than focusing on the actual forfeiture mecha nism and the effects on the party punished through deprivation of property, the Canadian Supreme Court's objective to rule for the government was a simple task.291 Under a literal reading of this 284.

If the laws were held to be federal in nature and ulta vires of provincial powers, it would have opened the door to a host of various Charter challenges. The most promising challenge would have been rooted in Section 7 (the due process equivalent) because the Canadian concept of a substantive right to counsel is very limited, extending to the duty of the police to inform a suspect that he may seek assistance and halt investigation if the suspect exercises his right.296 The CRA and other provincial forfeiture statutes contain forfeiture exemptions for access to forfeitable assets to pay legal expenses, but the contours of these exemptions have not been con sidered by the Canadian courts as there have not yet been post forfeiture challenges to the right to counsel.297 If the CRA had been struck down, such a challenge would have been likely, as criminal defense lawyers fear for their own livelihoods, just as 292.

If It's Broken, Fix It: American Solutions After having considered the constitutional and international implications of current forfeiture and money laundering law, there are four ways that the United States can effectively fight money-related crime without violating defendants' fundamental rights. A. Transparency and Fee Applications If prosecutors are genuinely concerned with the rights of criminal defendants to hire counsel, as well as the prospect of criminal defense lawyers concealing or participating in their cli ents' criminal activity, there is a simple solution. Congress can amend the federal forfeiture and money laundering laws by requiring that defense attorneys apply monthly for reasonable fees and expenses, detailing time and expense records and submit ting the report to a neutral government-appointed trustee. Upon the trustee's approval and under the supervision of the judge, the defense would be allowed to secure fees and expenses from the defendant for bona fide services. Congress would not even have to expend much time or energy on such an amendment since this system has already been contemplated in Federal Rule of Bank 298. See Price E-mail, supra note 137 ("My contacts with criminal lawyers indicate that they are worried about money being available to pay them due to civil forfeiture, so perhaps a case on right to counsel will arise in the future."). 299. See Tibbetts, supra note 274 (pointing out that under Canadian law, should Chatterjee be reversed, the government may have to refund those who were deprived of their property from provincial forfeiture mechanisms); see also Price Press Release, supra note 249 ("[Reversing the Chatterjee case] would be a political nightmare for the [Supreme Court of Canada]: it would have to invalidate several immensely popular provincial statutes . . . and it would likely have to say that criminals have a valid possessory interest in the proceeds of their crimes.").</page><page sequence="54">96 INTER-AMERICAN LAW REVIEW [Vol. 41:1 ruptcy Procedure 2016.300 As in bankruptcy cases, the need for fee transparency is apparent in large federal drug and money laun dering cases, albeit for different reasons.

This would consti tute "money laundering" in the classical section 1956 sense. Implementation of this proposal has two possible paths: the realis tic option would be to keep the current laws as they are and allow the constitutionally questionable ex parte pre-indictment or pre conviction restraining order on defendants' assets and deduct rea sonable attorneys' fees and expenses therefrom. Option two, the ideal path, would be to prohibit any pre-conviction forfeiture, but give the government a larger role and access to financial records and transactions between defense attorney and client. This proposal is open to the criticism that it is at odds with the traditional ideal of the defense lawyer, able to retain fees and work without big government looking over his or her shoulder. Although a government agent monitoring the private attorney cli ent relationship so closely would limit wrongdoing, such an expan sion is unprecedented and would be a tough pill for many lawyers to swallow. After all, the right to counsel in a bankruptcy setting is substantially narrower than the right that criminal defendants enjoy. However, this lost privacy (and added tedium) is a neces sary tradeoff and is better than the alternative: inability to retain fees from defendants in criminal cases, leading to the extinction of the private defense bar, or worse, criminal indictments against real estate agents, bankers and lawyers working in good faith. Receiving interim approval for fees and expenses in a more non formal, non-adversarial setting is a far more efficient process than anxiety-filled money laundering prosecution, and a tradeoff the defense bar could learn to embrace. Moreover, the defense lawyer need not divulge strategy or other private matters that would jeopardize the sacred attorney-client privilege; a rough description of the type of work and the hours spent would satisfy the disclo sure requirements. As in bankruptcy proceedings, the hourly rates paid to defense attorneys would have to be commensurate with the rates charged by similarly situated defense firms or rates charged by the same firm before the bankruptcy laws are absorbed into the federal criminal law, adjusted for inflation and market realities. The fee application process's logic in this context</page><page sequence="56">98 INTER-AMERICAN LAW REVIEW [Vol. 41:1 was hinted at by Professor Winick301 and Justice Blackmun302 over twenty years ago, and deserves more serious consideration. B. Revise and Codify Prosecutors' Manuals The United States Attorneys' Manual sections regarding for feiture and money laundering in connection with attorney's fees is far from perfect, but it is more reasonable than more constricted readings of the "bona fide purchaser" application provisions of 853(c) and the Sixth Amendment exemption of 1957(f) that certain federal courts have adopted.303 Codification of a narrow set of guidelines would hold federal prosecutors accountable if a fair and impartial district court judge was given the power to indepen dently analyze whether prosecutors were in fact following their own procedures. More importantly, codification would have pro phylactic effects, deterring abusive practices by law enforcement and prosecutors. One clearly deficient section of the manual that should be revised and then codified is the section stating that if an attorney becomes aware of an illegal source of funds during representation, those fees become forfeitable. 1957's intent requirement, as well as the manual, should be temporally adjusted to require attorney knowledge of illegality before retention. However, retention could be broadly construed to include all time after initial contact between attorney and client to prevent a co-conspirator attorney and client from transferring illegal funds post-acquaintance but before formal engagement letters are signed. Put simply, a good faith attorney should never be punished for simply doing due dili 301. See Winick, supra note 14, at 837 ("Applying the forfeiture statutes to legitimate attorneys' fees will not promote the predominant congressional interest asserted in the legislative history of the 1984 amendments-the avoidance of fraudulent transfers. So long as it can be assured that the fee paid to the attorney is a bona fide and reasonable one, rather than a sham or fraudulent transfer designed to avoid forfeiture, Congress'[sic] stated purpose is not frustrated. Indeed, exempting legitimate attorneys [sic] fees from forfeiture would serve Congress' [sic] interest in stripping drug dealers and racketeers of their 'economic power bases.'"). 302. See Caplin &amp; Drysdale, 491 U.S. 617, 642 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) ("[N]o important and legitimate purpose is served by employing ? 853(c) to require postconviction forfeiture of funds used for legitimate attorney's fees, or by employing ? 853(e)(1) to bar preconviction payment of fees. The Government's interests are adequately protected so long as the district court supervises transfers to the attorney to make sure they are made in good faith. All that is lost is the Government's power to punish the defendant before he is convicted. That power is not one the Act intended to grant.")

In addition to the temporal adjustment of intent, which would provide a more robust and actual constitutional attorney client privilege, Congress should specifically state that the federal sub jective "knowledge" mens rea should be applied and that a prose cutor can never "impose" knowledge of forfeitability upon a defense attorney by simply issuing an indictment. In Monsanto, the majority acknowledged that "it is highly doubtful that one who defends a client in a criminal case that results in forfeiture could prove that he was 'without cause to believe the property was sub ject to forfeiture.'"304 For an attorney, working hard on behalf of a client in good faith and to the best of his or her ability, to risk all fees to forfeiture based on an eventual declaration of guilt is some thing that the framers would simply not permit. "Reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfei ture"305 should mean bounded by reason; since adherence to the Constitution is reasonable, the forfeiture and money laundering laws should not prevent defense attorneys from doing their job, and part of that job is becoming privy to, but not a part of, a cli ent's legal problems. Admittedly, agencies need flexible internal guidelines that can be reconsidered, re-evaluated, or even disregarded in light of changed circumstances and no manual can predict everything; indeed, wholesale codification would be foolish. However, in a sensitive area of the law with such broad potential for prosecutorial abuse, codification is necessary to facilitate uniform ity in different districts and put defense lawyers on notice of what they can and cannot do. While it is true that no manual can pre dict every contingency, enough time has passed since the begin ning of the war on drugs, and enough forfeiture and money laundering proceedings have come and gone that expectations and norms have been established in this area. Perhaps a task force containing NACDL representatives and prosecutors could assem ble and use the twenty years of experience since Monsanto and Captin &amp; Drysdale to determine best practices and suggest laws that Congress could pass to promote accountability and fair play. 304.

Blanket Criminalization If it looks like criminal law and smells like criminal law, it is probably criminal law. The source of the problem is the insertion of civil law concepts into an area that is more criminal than any thing else; for example, the codification of the civil relation back fiction within sections 853, 1956 and 1957. The use of in rem for feiture concepts in criminal matters is suspicious, sidestepping constitutional scrutiny. In a perfect world, the government would be given an option: require the beyond a reasonable doubt stan dard and trigger defendant procedural protections, and thus limit the use of forfeiture, or, keep the current system as it is but pro hibit the use of forfeiture mechanisms in all cases involving a human defendant whose liberty is at stake. Again, to prevent pre conviction and post-indictment concealment by wealthy RICO defendants, the government would still be permitted to seize a defendant's assets after a fair adversarial probable cause hearing, if there is a probable cause basis that such concealment will occur or that the assets are evidence of a crime - such an action is con sistent with criminal procedure. The chief distinction between civil and criminal law is that the former involves the deprivation of property while the latter implicates not only a potential deprivation of property, but also stigmatization and a loss of liberty, or even life. Even after shak ing off the fictional aspects of in rem forfeiture, it could be argued, as has the government, that forfeiture is simply a civil penalty, resulting in a simple deprivation of property. However, this argu ment only scratches the surface. The focus must be on the injuri ous, real life burden pre-conviction forfeiture imposes on a defendant, suddenly deprived of a constitutional right to defend charges, through deprivation of the rights to counsel and due pro cess. When property is forfeited and impairs a defendant's ability to mount an effective defense, the framers' conception that prop erty is important in its power to preserve other rights becomes all too apparent. Moreover, since the stated purpose and effect of pre-conviction civil forfeiture beginning in the 1980s was to regu late drug crimes, it is more proper to group the area into the crimi nal category; the arguments by the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association in Chatterjee illustrated this point. Indeed, there is little, or no distinction between the deprivation of liberty as well as property that occurs in in personam forfeiture cases con nected with criminal charges and the punishment inflicted on par ties who lose their homes or vehicles via in rem proceedings. The</page><page sequence="59">2009] FEDERAL FORFEITURE 101 unfettered right of the government to concurrently utilize crimi nal and civil forfeiture mechanisms against the same defendant in the same matter grants prosecutors unfair leverage in negotiating plea agreements and must be curtailed. Situations where human defendants are declared not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but the government is allowed to retain property due to the lowered civil burden of proof should be disallowed as unlawful and illogi cal. Canadian forfeiture, in walking a jurisdictional tightrope, does not typically allow concurrent pre-conviction forfeiture and criminal charges upon the same defendant or in the same matter. Such a procedure, originating from Canada's jurisdictional struc ture, is fairer, more productive, and clearly averts double jeopardy problems. The confusion of criminal law in the United States in the federal and state domain, particularly after the passage of RICO, CCE and the MLCA has also blended the civil and criminal law in grotesque ways and it is time to fix past wrongs. D. Judicial Duty The previous three proposals involve Congress taking initia tive to improve the current state of affairs. District Court judges play a key role in interpreting the scope and application of the Constitution when faced with bona fide fee applications or motions to dismiss based on the 1957(f) Sixth Amendment exemp tion. The importance of scrupulous trial court judges should not be understated. As Judge Cooke recently demonstrated, Captin &amp; Drysdale has not sounded the death knell to the Bill of Rights in forfeiture and money laundering matters, despite submissions of such logic by prosecutors. Involving fees that were sought for ser vices rendered post-conviction, Captin &amp; Drysdale was not factu ally ideal and there is a great need for the courts to look at the merits of each case individually and develop a strong and fair body of precedent. Monsanto's facts were also far from perfect for those wishing to declare pre-conviction forfeiture unconstitutional; the petitioner was perceived as a mafioso drug peddler at a time when the war on drugs was at its peak. Perhaps it was Monsanto's social context, during war on drugs zealotry, rather than objective facts that were proper to fairly apply the law, that was determina tive. If the Court was presented with a pre-conviction forfeiture due process or right to counsel challenge from a non-violent secur ities fraud defendant rather than a perceived "bad man" like Mr. Monsanto, there may have been a different result and the current</page><page sequence="60">102 INTER-AMERICAN LAW REVIEW [Vol. 41:1 state of forfeiture and money laundering law would not be as deformed as it currently is. With what will likely be a conservative Court for at least the next twenty years, the justices who purport to have adopted a more traditional, original intent-based interpretation of the Con stitution have an opportunity to strike down unconstitutional laws, such as the relation back fiction, embedded in federal forfei ture and money laundering statutes. This would unequivocally demonstrate consistency with prior rulings, preserve the original intent of the drafters of the Constitution and achieve neutrality in principle. The move by originalist jurists to understand and apply what the framers intended by the excessive fines clause of the Eighth Amendment is a welcome example of moving in the right direction. The Supreme Court is also invited to resolve the anom aly of why the Constitution expressly forbids any forfeiture after a treason execution, but allows forfeiture of an entire vessel if mari juana for personal use is found aboard. On February 23, 2009, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Alvarez v. Smith.306 Below, the Seventh Circuit invalidated an Illinois law that permitted law enforcement to seize money or vehicles believed to be connected to drug-related crime and retain the property for up to half a year, without even having to file a forfeiture or criminal action, based simply on probable cause.307 The Seventh Circuit, in a challenge to the law involving the seizure of automobiles, held that due process requires a procedu ral forfeiture mechanism that tests the validity of government retention of the individual's property.308 The court calls for "some sort of pre-forfeiture mechanism and some level of notice to the property owner before seizure, but does not elaborate specific methods.309 The government petitioned for certiorari asking whether "the Due Process Clause requires a State or local govern ment to provide a post-seizure probable cause hearing prior to a statutory judicial forfeiture proceeding . . . ,"310 The Court's deci 306.

The Court should, however, hint as to whether the strong governmental interest that justified the deprivation of counsel and due process in cases like Caplin &amp; Drysdale and Monsanto still exists today. Rarely weighing in on the forfeiture issue, the Court should also signal whether attack ing federal forfeiture and money laundering statutes on due pro cess grounds could be a worthwhile task for future litigants. Anyone expecting the Court to affirm the Seventh Circuit's deci sion should remind themselves that the Court has been steadily chipping away at constitutional property rights. Finally, splits between the federal circuits on important con stitutional issues require further clarification by the Supreme Court. The fact that a criminal defendant in the Ninth Circuit is afforded heightened protections in forfeiture proceedings com pared with a defendant in the Eleventh Circuit violates basic notions of equal protection under the law and fundamental fair ness. Considering inconsistencies within the circuits in regards to protections afforded defendants through forfeiture hearings (or lack thereof) and the extent of what constitutes dirty property under the facilitation theory, these issues are currently ripe and the Court will likely be given an opportunity to offer uniformity in the circuits. Given wide variance among the circuits regarding what hearings a forfeiture defendant deserves and to be consistent with the Constitution's mandates, the Supreme Court must stand ardize, at a minimum, an adversarial probable cause seizure hear ing pre-forfeiture since forfeiture is seizure. Regarding the circuit split on facilitation theory, the prosecutor's burden to demonstrate the connection between the property and the illegal act must be heightened since a prosecutor should be forced to establish a real connection between the property and the alleged crime. Perhaps a proportionality formula can be expounded, whereby if the govern ment can show 15% of the home or business was used to conceal illegal funds or engage in illegal activity, 15% of the property could be restrained until conviction, and this percentage could change as further facts were established before conviction. Cer tainly, the framers would scoff at a government that seizes legiti mate property.
